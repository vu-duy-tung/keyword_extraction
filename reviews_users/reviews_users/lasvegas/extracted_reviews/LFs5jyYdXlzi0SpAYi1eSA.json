I needed a break from the \"action\" of the conference and wanted to be able to sit down and enjoy myself and my meal. I headed over across the street from the Wynn to Maggiano's. I was promptly greeted and seated.  There's a Maggiano's in the Bay Area in CA so I was expecting the same level of food given it's a chain restaurant. They did not disappoint. The food was excellent. On top of that, the staff was extremely courtesy and friendly. I would definitely go back!",

The environment is lovely. There is a violinist playing beautiful songs from table to table. The food were fabulous. We had crab cake for appetizer. The crab was fresh and delicious. I had sauteed shrimps with risotto and it was fantastic. The rice was creamy but not to soft. Shrimp was cooked just enough. My friend has salmon with pasta. It looked nice too.",

We were not disappointed.  I asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didn't have a menu, but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  They even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if I wanted chicken parmesan.  Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming.  To make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only $6.  YES PLEASE!  I ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan.  All I can say is WOW.  My meal was BEYOND fantastic.  I fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster.  Both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day.  Hubby's grandmother came straight from Italy and trust me, these meals rivaled hers.  My only disappointment is we don't have a Maggiano's where we live.  Seriously, it was THAT good.",

    "text": "I just love Maggiano's. Not usually a fan of big chains, but I just love them. I have one close to where I live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate.   While in Vegas with my family, I insisted we have a big family meal at Maggiano's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday night.   We arrived on time, but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated. The place was totally packed, so we had to stand, smashed together, in the bar area while we waited. That sucked, and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations.  Our server was extremely busy (there was an 18 top in our section), but he did a fantastic job, considering how busy he was, and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with.  The food was fantastic. I ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the eggplant parmesan. Everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke. However, we prefered it on the table bread, as opposed to the \"crostini\" it's served with. The little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious, creamy, piping hot, rich spinach artichoke dip.   My eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious. Unfortunately, in total vegas style, it was enormous. A small family could have shared it (I have a big family....haha). It was just perfect. I'm not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm, but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there. It couldn't have been better, honestly. Four meals came out of it- the one that night, a midnight snack later, my meal on the plane the next day, and my husband's lunch the next day. It was even delicious cold!  For desert, my sister ordered the 5 desert platter. It had tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple pie ala mode, and....I can't remember the last one. It was so pretty- and only $9.95. The whole table shared it, and we still had leftovers. I'm not a fan of sweets, so I only nibbled a couple things. My sister said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever had.  All in all, it was a fantastic night. I remember sitting back for a moment, looking around the table... everyone was laughing, eating, and having a wonderful time.",

We then shared a plate of Fried Calamari as an appetizer which was excellent !  I had their Linguine Di Mare ( which consisted of Lobster , Shrimp , Mussels and Clams in a  soupy like red sauce excellent for bread dipping ) over Linguine , I have had this dish in New York Italian restaurants and it was exactly what I expected it to be and more it was awesome !   My friend had a Spinach Salad with grilled Shrimp which she loved !   The atmosphere and decor was very nice and if you didn't know it was a chain restaurant you would never expect it was , service was very good as well our waitress was very informative , helpful and polite though she was working us as tourist her routine came across as  scripted .  As for desert we were too full from the generous portions and just had a very nice cup of Espresso with some Sambuca .  I was also amazed at the pricing considering it's location to the Strip .  This is a must stop for any one who enjoys a good home / family style meal !",

There's not much of a waiting area which sucks because it feels like you're always in the way. Once we were seated it was more of the same. The tables were very close together and people kept squeezing by our table which truly annoyed me. For that reason i had to remove one star. However everything else was superb! I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious. In fact I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it! I also had a Caramel apple martini which was delicious! I had to get another. By the end of the meal my belly was full and my body was tipsy. I'd say that's a perfect way to end the day! :-)",

We also asked \"what was the point of making the reservation if we had to wait for so long anyways?\" the supervisor said that \"If we didn't like it, then we could call and complain about it.\" So after no apology or the supervisor even offering to check on the table for us, we left very unhappy.

We arrived at 800pm, confirmed our reservation, and the hostess said \"Great, we are seating right at the reservation times, we will text you when your table is ready\". We went into the bar to wait, at 830pm we receive a text confirmation of our reservation at 9pm? We went back to the hostess who now cannot find our reservation at 815 or even at 900! She now is asking \"do we even HAVE a reservation?\" irregardless of the fact that she did confirm it just a half hour earlier. They (reluctantly we feel!) gave us a table where the service was not impressive. Our waiter was also less than expected. When we ordered our own choices rather than the specials he suggested, he simply said \"whatever you want\" and walked off. His bad attitude was incredible! Are the waiters paid on commission by how many alcoholic drinks are ordered? It was laughable how hard he was pushing us to order more drinks or a bottle of wine. When we said \"no thanks\" we meant it! We will go to the Maggiano's in Scottsdale but will skip Vegas in the future!",

Unfortunately we waited over an hour for our food, then we were informed by our server that our food had been given to another table and eaten. The manager came and apologized and 10 minutes later our food came. My plate was missing the meatballs so they took it back to fix it. While I was waiting for my plate I tasted my husbands and it was horrible. Very bland and the shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. When they finally brought my plate I felt so sick from eating that shrimp we just said never mind and ended up leaving. The manager took care of the bill( which he should have) and gave us a free dessert. It was so very disappointing on Valentine's Day",

Me and my partner walked in at 12 around lunch time not busy .... and we got seated right away ... ( I recommend getting seated next to the far end right next to the window to see the strip) our server Tyler brought bread very quickly and I asked for sauce and she gladly brought it .... she took our order about 10 minutes later our food was brought to the table and it was amazing such a beautiful dish .... we order dessert next and what can I say the tiramisu is beyond amazing it just MELTS in your mouth.....  This restaurant is one of the best Italian restaurant I've gone so far ... I can even say it's better than Olive Garden.... I would most definitely be back a billion times",

    "text": "This restaurant was such a delightful surprise! My Mom and I were in the mood for Italian but weren't prepared to spend more than 25$ each for pasta. We found this on Yelp and the reviews were great, so we decided to give it a try. We arrived after 8 pm, so it wasn't busy and we didn't require a reservation - although I can see it being busy earlier in the evening. We were walked through the restaurant to the very end, and were given a beautiful strip view table. It was great! We were promptly served warm bread with oil for dipping, and made our selections off the menu. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and my Mom ordered the Mushroom Ravioli. Both of them offered lighter options, but with all the energy we expended all day walking the Strip, we decided we deserved the full calories. My mother has a severe nut and seed allergy, so we informed our waiter - who directly brought out the chef to discuss her dining options. Never before have I experienced this level of consideration for allergies in a restaurant. The food was brought out quickly, and was absolutely delicious. It was probably the best food I have had on the Strip for such a reasonable price. We devoured all of the hearty portions, and were totally stuffed. We were then approached about desserts, and were offered the NUT FREE house made brownie. We did not have the room for dessert, but we will be back for the brownie another day. Our total bill for two meals and one soda was only 42 dollars. Amazing! Top marks here!!",

I rarely eat at these kinds of restaurants, but pricing here is fair. I'd definitely come back again to try more dishes.",

    "text": "Love Maggiano's for great pasta!   Maggiano's is noted for their excellent sauces and pasta combinations. You usually get a quite large portion as well. I can usually barely stuff half the bowl down and have to take the rest to go.  I am a fan of the simple fettucine alfredo here. Their sauce is homemade and has that traditional cream taste that is perfect and blows chains like Olive Garden out of the water. Add chicken if you get the chance....the chicken is that soft, pulled chicken taste like it came off a rotisserrie chicken, instead of the gross, rubbery cubes or strips that you get at lesser chain restaurants. So yummy!  Dishes are plenty big to share. Appetizers as well. We order the Fried Mozzerella and it is definitely enough for four and impossible for two to eat alone. Very reasonably priced as well, right on par with Olive Garden, but much, much better quality.  If you do the large 'family style' dining or have a birthday they bring you these soft cookies with a lemon glaze that is perfect for nights when you are already stuffed full of heavy pasta. The perfect quick, sweet bite.  Only warning is this is not a location that is a quick stop. Save for rare occasions they are extremely busy 7 days a week. Even with a reservation you will likely end up waiting 10 minutes or so before being seated. Request to be seated away from a main aisle way or you risk getting jostled and bumped by passing rude dining parties.   Have always had exceptional service by the servers. They are always personable, quick and welcoming.   There is a kindly older gentleman who usually comes around with a guitar or accordion (?) and offers you a song with your meal. This is perfect for those celebrating a birthday or anniversary.",

My husband ordered the Caesar Salad and Lasagna. He didn't want to tell me that their lasagna was better than mine. I had the Maggiano Salad and Chicken Piccata. It was fabulous. Their meals are delicious and the prices are reasonable. If you have not tried this restaurant do yourself a favor and do so. You will not be disappointed.

Not sure if will dine here again, as this wasn't the first Maggiano location who didn't provide good service, which is unfortunate.",

I was able to book everything online via email through Beth.  Beth was fabulous every step of the way, she answered my emails very quickly, always responded to my \"just one more thing\" and took a few moments to show me around when I arrived in town before our event.  When we arrived everything was set up and ready to go, we were able to step outside for less than 10 minutes, review our bill and pay it so we could just enjoy our evening. The flow of the evening went smoothly, the food was incredible, my guests are still talking about it and Joe kept our glasses filled.  My only complaint was that I didnt get to try the chicken dish that I heard was so delicious but that was my own fault (and Joes for being so efficient in filling my wine glass)!     When we were ready to leave our leftovers were boxed up and ready to go which was great for our guests and ultimately us too as our flight was cancelled and it made for a great breakfast even though there was no chicken left over!  If you need a place to host an event this is the place to go everything was wonderful from start to finish, thanks again!",

The decor is nice; they managed to make this place look older than it is. The staff seemed well-prepared and efficient, but this place really gets packed. I recommend making a reservation, otherwise you may wait 30 minutes or more.  The only thing that was a bit off was that they had a live guitarist/singer walking around the tables. He was a nice guy, but he made us a bit uncomfortable not knowing if we were supposed to tip.  We enjoyed our meal and the price was reasonable. If this place were in Hawaii, I'd go back for sure.",

The wait was long and it was hot, but we opted to sit in the outdoor seating area to avoid waiting (underneath the escalator, without misting system as it was out). The view across the Strip looking at Wynn's lush landscaping was kinda nice. The ads playing on loop on the Wynn billboard also kept me entertained. There were a couple of memorable ambulance runs down the Strip, as I felt compelled to to pressed my hands to the baby's ears to protect her eardrums.   Not much to say about the food, it's Maggiano's. I remember liking the one in Houston better but I think it depends on what you get and I was not particularly impressed with the dishes we got that night.

My 11 year old got the Mama's Lasagna & my 13 year old got the Fettuccine Alfredo and they both thought it was epic.

Although, this spot is in a mall, I really wouldn't have pegged Maggiano's as a chain restaurant. The restaurant is spacious and comforting.  The food was pretty good as well. I went with the veal piccata and tried some baked ziti and four cheese ravioli. The veal was not as tender as I would of liked it to be but it was still nicely prepared and the sauce was right on. The pastas were tasty, especially the ravioli. A bottle of wine completed our meal.  After lunch, my buddies and I went to the bar for some blue label whiskey, which I've tried one other time before I really had a decent palette for whiskey. All, I have to say is wow!! It was so much better the second time around.  The bill for the whiskey was another wow!! Our bartender sheepishly placed our bill on the table. 42 bucks a piece... Damn, I was thinking maybe $20... The bartender was nice enough to pore us the rest of the bottle though! Vegas baby!  I did feel bad for my buddy who was not a whiskey drinker at all. He ended up asking for a coke, which he ended up mixing the whiskey with. Oh wow...",

Beth the banquet manager was amazing and went beyond to help make this a great memory for my son, daughter, mom, and our guest.

We were also able to order off of the special Thanksgiving menu, which was a great mix of the traditional Thanksgiving fare coupled with some Italian favorites.  They also brought you more of anything you wanted in spite of the original portions being humongous.

Everything delcious. Even saved room fro teh tiremisu desert which is probabaly one of the best tiremisu's I ever eat. Assad our waited was on top of things the whole time. made sure we always had everything we wanted and very friendly. I will ask for him next time I go. Only reason didn;t give it 5 star is because the items are just a tad bit pricey i think. I have noticed the prices inch up little by little every tiem I visit. But since this is a Vegas strip location, they can do this I guess, since more tourists than locals go here.",

Usually I always get emails for coupons but since I live so far and my car is ancient I never drive that far, so it all worked out.

For appetizers we got the Italian sausage flatbread which had a nice flavor to it and the bottom wasn't burnt! yesssss! We also got the risotto bites which were not bad, and pretty filling.  I got the chicken francese which was delicious. The chicken was juicy and the arugula salad had a nice light dressing, and I'm usually really picky about my salads especially the dressing. I'm happy to say that that whole dish came together really well. There was also a side of potato wedges with my meal which I couldn't finish.  The linguine di mare can feed two people and came with a surprising amount of seafood.",

The restaurant came recommended so I had high expectations and it didn't disappoint.  The restaurant is quite large and when we arrived between 1-2PM, it was busy but not crowded.  We went to the hostess stand and almost immediately someone came to show us our table for 4.  I sat in the seat facing the bar area and had a view of a TV if I wanted to be entertained.  The menu had what sounds like great pastas, salads, sandwiches, and flatbreads.  I usually get the Linguine di Mare with lobster, shrimp, mussels and calms but this day, I decided to get the shrimp scampi thinking it might be less food for me to eat.  Our server was friendly and happy with a smile but not annoying.  He was great to bring us bread, mmmm, warm bread and poured the oil, and brought balsamic vinegar to include.  It was a great start to a delicious meal.  It didn't seem we had to wait long for our main seafood meals.  The portion size didn't disappoint (I had asked our server if they had half portions but nope!) There was about 20 shrimp and on top of a large plate of angel hair pasta.  My husband helped me eat the shrimp but it was too much pasta for me.  This was a delicious meal and at under $20, it was a deal too! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

Luckily, the bar is open seating and we were able to get a hightop table. Usually I skip the bread on the table but I was starving, so I had a piece. It was very good and I didn't put anything on it.  We started with the Mozzarella Marinara for an appetizer. I used to love it but last night it tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up in a microwave. (not a good taste!) It came out about five minutes after we ordered it...so I'm not sure how it was prepared.  For dinner, I ordered chicken parmigiana and it was delicious, as always! It comes with two large pieces of chicken and a side of spaghetti. For dessert, I ordered strawberry cheesecake to go. I ate it the next day and it wasn't the best I've had...but it wasn't bad. Overall, we had a nice experience. If you're a tourist and want yummy food with a good view, request a seat by the window!",

Usually, I use them for meetings -- their private dinning space and budget friendly menus are great anywhere in the USA.    But this visit I found myself in the Fashion Mall on the Vegas strip.  I wasn't in the mood to shop nor did I want to pay $6++ for Starbucks so I went into Maggiano's to grab a coffee.  It was between lunch and dinner and the bar was empty.  I bellied up to the bar and ordered my 3 shots of espresso and read my book -- sometimes I find relaxing spots in the most unlikely places.    The bartender was friendly but kept her distance as I wasn't in the mood to chat. Plus the off-hour diners kept her busy.  I had to leave before my coffee was finished so she gave me a kid's sippy cup so I could take my coffee to go!  Great service!",

We pre selected the family style food. My husband family are very picky Italians...so they have a high standard. Maggianos surpassed their expectations.  We were served antipasto as a free surprise. Roasted garlic, fresh motza, bruschetta and toasted bread slices...amazing! Additional courses included motza sticks, braised beef, spaghetti and meatballs (meatballs were a bit salty), fettuccine alfredo, chicken parmigiana...followed by dessert of creme brulee and cheesecake. Service was amazing! They kept things moving and food was warm. They brought out champagne and cookies for the bride and groom. Highly recommend them and we will be back.",

Their service is great and I just love the fact that you can be seated next to a window overlooking the strip. Love this place, It is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants in Vegas. Definitely not fine dining but its a lot better than your average restaurant. Give it a try if you haven't already!",

I thought my veal was pretty dry, but most others with me were all happy with what they got even if over-priced.  I would give a three, if not for the tourist \"sell you pictures\".  They claim to be fine dining, upscale, etc.  It may be on the Strip, but when paying for a nice dinner I don't need someone taking pictures and then trying to sell them back to me like I'm in an amusement park.  Plenty of other places I can be pestered for that, and not real happy being bothered in the middle of a dinner. I should have saved a few bucks and gone to Outback.  They really need to decide if they want to be sub-par and pester, or be the fine dining place they claim to be. My wife got the surf and turf, around $50.  We'll not be stopping here on future visits, to pay that, so we can be offered to buy a picture.  Crazy.  Service was ok.  Nothing special, but nothing real bad either.

    "text": "Been busy lately and time with the GF had been at a minimum.  Over the years she has spoken very highly of Maggianos.  Having never been before... a window of opportunity would present it's self to give it a shot.  The GF had a gift card, we had the time and reservations were made.  We arrived at the Fashion Show Mall and parked half way from the north forty.  We made our way around the outside of the mall and entered.    Very nice atmo and servers in white shirts.  We had a window table.  Sounds fancy....but it was not.  We gazed out on the promenade outside and watched people loiter and or pass by.  Service was initially slow, and pretty much stayed that way through the entire meal.  I had a drink run empty and was not addressed until 15-20 minutes after.  I ordered up the Chicken Piccata.  It looked delicious on the menu.  The GF ordered up Chef KB's Lobster Carbonara.  We chowed down on bread prior to plate touchdown.  If they don't bring the balsamic, be sure to ask for it.  When the plates arrived, I surveyed the contents.  It all looked good enough.  Dipping into the two plates with my fork.....something seemed off.  It seemed almost sort of commonplace.    My eyes and my knowledge of the location told me I was at someplace that was supposed to be special.   My tastebuds were telling me I have been here many times before.  I could not really put my finger on it.  That was until I noticed the gift card the GF was partially paying with.  On the back of the card, were familiar corporate foodie locations I was well aware of.    Putting it all together, Maggiano's taste reminded my of other chains.  Putting it all together, I can check this off the list.",

For this place being on the strip and the time I went, I was impressed with how quickly they sat us down. The restaurant is gorgeous, low lit, romantic and our server was very friendly and quick. The bread was so good with olive oil and balsamic, we had 2 baskets. The food came very quickly, very suprised at that as well. While we waited for the food, a man playing an acoustic guitar was offering to sing at the tables. He was not awkward at all, meaning pressing a song, or if you said no, he was just happy to move on. We asked him to sing a song, which wasn't long, maybe about a minute, which to me is appropriate, a guy hanging out singing too long can get awkward. He was very sweet and nice older gentlemen. The food was very tasty and we even got the cheesecake and creme brulee for dessert. The price of food with no alcohol only came out to about $71 with tip for 2 people. So it was very reasonable. I will be definitely be coming here again.",

    "text": "My friends & I had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at Maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. We had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. There was plenty of room for a display table as well. And there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & Encore. They had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). Overall the service and the experience was a positive one. I think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at Maggiano's. I'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. My friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. So convenient...  Now on to the menu: First course was stuffed mushrooms, calamari & italian salad. The stuffed mushrooms were good. They were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. They were served in a white wine sauce. You cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. Fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. Just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. The italian salad was surprisingly delicious. Salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. Good appetizers. I enjoyed every single one of them.   Second course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. I loved the meat lasagna. But really, what's not to love? It's lasagna! And it was classically delicious. They don't call it \"Mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. Crumbled meatballs & sausage with ricotta cheese. Boom! I didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. The chicken marsala was so very good. White meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. It was the perfect chicken dish. I loved it the most... And that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. Order it. Trust me.  For dessert, we had 2 offerings. Chocolate zucotto cake & Nonna's toasted pound cake. All I had was the toasted pound cake & that's all I needed. It was so damn good. Crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. Game over. I dont have to tell you how good it was. You already know.   You're welcome...",

    "text": "The Skinny: for Italian, food is okay but are skimpy on portion sizes for the price (3) service: prompt and efficient (4) baby friendly: They do have a changing station in the family bathroom and their booth can accommodate an infant car seat. Strollers are parked away from the tables. Value: for the level of cuisine, it is definitely overpriced (3).  If I were to sum up what the feeling was after leaving Maggiano's, it would be an overpriced, upscale Olive Garden.   Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely better as is the service. But the prices seemed exorbitant for what it was.   We ordered a plate of fried zucchini, a lunch special (half chicken parmesan sandwich and half Caesar salad), and a plate of gnocchi.  The fried zucchini was a bit greasy and the coating was too heavy. The ranch dressing was relatively bland and lacked acidity. For $12 it was a smaller portion than I expected.  The lunch special with a half portion of a soup, salad or sandwich for $10.50. I got the chicken parm sammy with a half Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was pretty generic and generally uninteresting (there was no garlicky, lemony, anchovy punch at all). The chicken parmesan sandwich was very skimpy on the chicken parm and could have used more marinara.  The gnocchi fared better. The gnocchi was soft and not overly gummy. However the sauce it was paired with was overly salty and needed more acidity to lighten the dish.  Service was good and prompt. Our water glasses remained filled and our food/check came quickly.   For families, they do have a changing station in the family bathroom which is hovering over the toilet. There is no private area to breastfeed. Strollers are parked around the hostess station while an infant car seat can fit in one of the booths.  Overall, the joint is okay in my books. The level of cuisine certainly does not merit the lofty prices they charge. But then again, this restaurant is on the Strip. 3 starred review.",

The selection was from meatballs to fried eggplant to steak.   The place is massive and very well maintained.   The food was just ok. Nothing wrong with it, but maybe because it was such a big party they couldn't really wow us.   There's so many places in Vegas to eat, so it would be hard to comeback here, until my company hosts the same party here again next year!  The service was actually pretty good. Somebody at my table was lactose intolerant and they were very attentive to his problem.   They made him his own dish, which or course is very nice.",

I had the chicken piccata and thoroughly enjoyed it! I didn't think any of the flavor was lost, but yes, the portion was a bit smaller than what I'm used to there. However, it was still filling.  Hubby had the linguini de mare, which was really good (not lighter fare). We started with the Maggiano salad (him) and Italian salad (me) and both really enjoyed our respective orders.  We shared the toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas for dessert and it was deeeelish!   Our server was Seidi and I highly recommend asking for her section. We eat out quite often and the service we experienced from her was the best we've had in a while!",

There is one near my house and I prefer to eat at places I have never been while I am on vacation, but it was my friends birthday dinner. We had a party of 11, so we had to order off the family style menu. We looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there. We ordered the Fried Mozzarella and Stuffed Mushrooms to start. For entrees we ordered a Lobster Carbonara, Chicken Parmesan, Beef Medallions and a Bow Tie Pasta. We thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  We where well fed. Dessert was my favorite. House made terramissu and Apple Cobbler. Wonderful!   Our server was wonderful too. She was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks never ran dry. It was a great experience. =)",

We planned on eating really quick and leaving as closing is at 11 but we ended up staying longer until around 12 and the servers didn't mind at all. The service was amazing 9 out of 10, the waiters were checking up on us and asking us how our prom was and cracking jokes and was the best part of the night. They got one of my friends orders wrong but it was alright as she didn't mind and we were all too hungry to wait for them to get her original order. The food was 10 out of 10. The serving sizes are huge and I could barely eat any of it before I asked for a take-out box. This prompted everyone to say that they wanted some too and the server ended up giving all of us boxes, along with take-out boxes for desert without prompting from us. I got the 4 cheese ravioli and although there are only about 7 ravioli on the plate they are HUGE yet oh so delicious and fresh out of the oven that the plate was still burning hot.  desert was amazing, I got the new york style cheesecake and while it was small because I was doing a prom promo it was still amazing, it wasn't as dense as a normal cheesecake would be and with our stomachs full from the main dish that was perfect.",

    "text": "2 stars, because I've definitely experienced better.  I booked a reservation through Open Table. I actually changed my reservation twice because my parents' plans kept changing. First I scheduled it at 7pm, then I changed it to 6pm, then finally to 6:45. I got a confirmation email for each change, so it was fine. In my reservation I specifically stated: We would greatly prefer a view seating as we are here to celebrate my mother's 63rd birthday. Did that happen? NOPE.  When we arrived at 6:45, I went up to the heavy set host/supervisor who didn't even care to greet me and told him I had a reservation that I made on Open Table for 6:45. He clicked around on his computer and said he didn't see and record of it. I proceeded to login to my Open Table account and pull up the whole reservation on my Ipod. I maximized the time, name, and party party size and showed it to him. He scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something that'd prove me wrong, but there was nothing. My reservation was right there on my phone. He told me \"well, you should really call to verify your reservations\" and I said, \"Oh, does this happen a lot here?\" he said, \"No, that's never happened. This is the first time I've ever seen that happen.\" As if I made everything up! I tried to explain that I changed my reservation a couple times and that might be why, and he said \"no, that wouldn't be the reason.\" So wtf is the reason then? Not that I care, but he just stood there making it seem as if I forged a reservation on my phone or something. Ridiculous. After a couple minutes of just telling me he doesn't see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said he'll try and find us a table, as if it was such a huge favor. They took us to the back, as far away from the windows possible and sat us in some table right behind a pillar, so the only view we could've gotten was then blocked.   I was very upset. The whole reason why I chose this place for my mom's birthday is because they wanted a decently priced restaurant with a view. Instead, we got a shitty table in the back of the room behind a pillar that we paid a total of $114 for. I could've gotten a better ambiance at Olive Garden with employees 5x more polite and a bill half as high. At least the food was good...too bad my appetite was spoiled before we even sat down.   To make matters even worse. I went home and checked my email, only to find that Maggiano's marked me as a NO SHOW on Open Table. How the F*ck did they mark me as a no show if my reservation was supposedly NOT THERE?! 100 points out the window. I had to contact customer service to explain that I was there and take a picture of my receipt for proof, so I wouldn't have the no show on my record. Their response, \"Based on our diagnostics, your reservation was in the restaurant's electronic reservation book, but for some reason this was not conveyed to you. Thank you for making us aware of this discrepancy!\" Hmm, I wonder why that happened?  Very upset with Maggiano's and that heavy set host/supervisor man, so much that I don't plan on coming back here anymore. I'll Splurge on Capital Grille instead if I want that same view.",

They miss counted the seats and left one out, a friend grabbed a chair and added it to the table, but we still had to wait for extra settings and menus. It took a while to get drink orders in, but water was at the tables already. I got an Arnold Palmer with Vodka, it was on the weak side but tasty. A friend got a Coke and said it was flat.  Bread was served with plenty to go around. It was warm, soft and yummy.  I got the Italian Salad, it was very average, the italian vinagrette was quite boring. I ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni special, which I have had before, it was very good, lots of crab chunks and shrimp. Some friends got the Chicken Parmesean, the portions are huge, but they loved the food as well. No one at our table had a complaint about the food. Most of us skipped desert. Roving musicians entertained us while we digested and others finished up their sweets. Beautiful atmosphere, our waiter was great, food was pretty similar to most italian restaurants around.",

I always leave satisfied and the service has always been wonderful. Visited the Santa Ana, CA, Chevy Chase, MD, and Tyson's Corner, VA locations - all the BOMB!   My favorites:   Rigatoni 'D'  Chicken Parmesan - I order this with a side of pasta and meat sauce since the chicken parm does not come with it  Apple Crostada  Peach Bellini - Now you know I have to have a cocktail with dinner!   I've also sampled the spaghetti which is also pretty good. Honestly, I've had better though.   Maggiano's is one of the last locations on the strip that offers a classy upscale atmosphere without the pretentiousness and is extremely affordable and family friendly.  I highly recommend Maggiano's.",

I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, which was delish. The warm, italian bread dipped in seasoned olive oil was finger-licking good; not that I licked my fingers... I had three delicious dishes for the mini dessert sampler: New York style cheesecake (yummy), apple crostada (yummy), and chocolate Zuccotto cake (yummy).  The price was pretty good.   I dined alone as my friends were napping to recover from the evening's debaucheries.   I will be back!",

Maggiano's Restaurant has had the same owner since 1996. There has been no ownership change. If you had a bad experience, Maggiano's thrive's on customer satisfaction and will make sure that your next experience is a happy and memorable one.

I tried to be respectful of the other people eating, so when I made the reservation I requested a table in a far corner of the restaurant. We get there and get seated and they put us at the table in the main dining area in the corner right next to the window that overlooks Wynn. We have eaten at this exact same table before, but not with a baby. Anyway we decided to stay and have a wonderful meal. The waitress was very helpful with my son, from making sure he had a cup with a lid to bringing us extra straws for him to chew on. The food was great like every other time we went. I had some type of pasta with Lobster all up in it. DAMN it was good. I savored every bite. Everyone else in our party loved the food as well. Even when my son screamed a little, it didn't seem to bother anyone else sitting around us. That may have been because we were there for reservations at 5pm and we were there for an hour and a half or so. So many of the dinner people probably would not have started getting there for another hour or so.   Great time again Maggianos, I have a feeling we will be back next time.",

My party had to grab the attention of our server on several occasions, such as to refill our empty glasses of water. Everything came out all at once. So our table had no room for our appetizers, cold bread, and our meals. Oh and we had no dinner ware. I guess they expected us to eat with our hands. Why not? We were being treated like barbarians, so why not eat like one! So once again, we had to flag someone for dinnerware, since our server disappeared on us. The menu had changed drastically since we were here last. I think we would have had a better deal ordering Italian from Pizza Hut...and probably received better service! Am I being too harsh? Not after spending all that money on what is supposedly \"upscale\" Italian. Granted they seemed to have two very large events going on, but that is no excuse for providing us with lack luster food and service.

My salmon salad was delivered in a small bowl, making it look boring & unappetizing (why not spread out on a plate?)  My partner's country pasta dish of ricotta chicken meatballs & sundried tomatoes was not very Italian at all & he said he wouldn't order it again.  The service was terrific, however.     So, here it is... capitalizing on their location & adhering to the bottom line called MONEY.",

    "text": "I love maggionos! I always try to find a reason to dine here. Chicken parm is good, meatball and spaghetti is great, and their red sauce just makes it that much better. Calamari is really yummy, not overly breaded or chewy. Lunch menu has a good chicken parm sandwich. Salads are good, fresh and deliccious dressings... Now the hot bread they serve....... I could eat this bread all night with their cheese and balsamic.  It's good they bring it out in small 4-5 rolls because I would have rolls for days...... on my thighs..... I do wish there was a location off the strip in summerlin somewhere.... weekend wait times are terrible, so get a reservation. The fried zucchini is one of the best I've ever had with ranch BUT it's just too big to share between two people. Eat here. Just do it. Oh and they usually have a musician walking around asking if you want them to play something if your into that sort of stuff.",

The response time and efficiency of the process was impressive.  Our questions and concerns were addressed at every turn.  We chose the restaurant based on pictures and the menu we found on line. My husband decided to take an earlier trip to \"taste test the food and see the space\"... as well as golf.  He came back raving about the food and assured me that I would love the venue.    The first time I stepped foot into Maggiano's was on the way to the alter and I can say, it blew me away.  The atmosphere is so beautiful and romantic.  The food and service was absolutely amazing. The menu options are by far the best value money can buy in Vegas.  You definitely will not go away hungry.  We still get compliments from my guests and we can guarantee they will all be eating at Maggiano's on their next visit to Vegas!  If you are considering Maggiano's Little Italy as your venue of choice, you won't go wrong!  We do, without hesitation, recommend to everyone we talk to, to have a meal at Maggiano's.  It is perfect for parties of all sizes and you will definitely impress your guests.  Thank you, thank you, thank you! For everything!  Sheri & Bill",

    "text": "After extremely abusive service at Maggiano's tonight, I'm calling it quits. The food was burned and the server was so rude that we didn't feel comfortable with the scene that we thought complaining would have caused. It went sort of comical at first, but the longer the service continued for, the more abusive it got until it was downright hostile at the end.  It all started with drinks we ordered at the bar; the hostesses told us it would be a 20-25 minute wait, so we ordered there. Our table was ready in 10, so we settled up at the bar (the bartender was incredibly nice, btw) and took he drinks to our seat. The waitress was clearly agitated that we already had drinks and said she didn't bring us bread because we might have just gotten that at the bar too (you only get bread with dinner, so that was a very clear dig). My girlfriend said \"are we being punished for having drinks already?\" when the waitress left the table, and it was obvious we were.    She paid attention to the table's around us and didn't even make eye contact with us. She finally asked about the food hallways through our meal by saying \"it's good, right\" while looking at the plate of burned cannelloni that was sitting mostly uneaten (I'm posting pictures). When a server asked a question like that as brusquely as she did, she sin't looking for the truth, so I kept my mouth closed while my girlfriend said her dinner was fine. She asked us if we wanted desert or more drinks and when we said no, she plopped down our dirty plates back down at the edge of the table and stormed off to get our check. She dropped it at the table and that was the last we saw of her.   We talked it over while trying to make change between the two of us and left her a 10% tip. I don't believe in less than 15% typically (we left the bartender 30%), but she was so rude I think that I should have left nothing.    I used to take people here all the time (and it was recommended in my Las Vegas list) because the atmosphere was nice, the view is great and the food was reliable. Lately, none of that has been True and I'm done trying to weather out a bad time at Maggiano's. I've been to this location 5 times in the last year (I'm the duke of checkins here on Yelp), but tonight will probably be the last. Disinterested service I can overlook and even incapable service is something I'll suffer through for decent food or the right occasion. I've learned my lesson tonight though; there are too many better places that are only a stones throw away.",

The staff can be overwhelmed and I believe that happened tonight. Our waiter was too much in a rush. He was very helpful to the rest of my party but pretty much ignored my drink order. When he did give me attention, I asked for Sam Adams Oktoberfest. I got regular Sam Adams. The thing that bothered me the most is how he told us about the availability specials and the one thing I wanted to order on the regular menu was no longer available.  Nothing was said about it earlier. At that point I felt like possibly not having a meal. My party talked me into finding something else to eat. The meal went fine after that. Usually a manager stops by to see how things are going but due to the volume and a few large parties we only saw him at at the door as we were leaving. Will I go to another Maggianos? yes. Will I go to this one?...probably not. Not during a convention.",

Bland flavors, over cooked pasta that had been reheated into a mush.  Absolute disaster!",

BEST. IDEA. EVER. we got a taste of everything and there was more than enough food to go around. i love this place! =)",

The food here is fantastic - I highly recommend the flat breads or caesar salad for an appetizer. Also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. If you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. However, this option is ONLY AVAILABLE for groups of four or over. Do not waste your calories/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home.",

I came here with a large group and we were served family style with so many delicious entrees but this place had already won me over before the food came.The restaurant has a glass wall and if you sit in the right corner you can see the fashion show mall, wynn las vegas, and even down the north end of the strip. I loved watching the Wynn sign change colors and move as I ate and enjoyed great cocktails. The food was authentic Italian food and vey filling. Delicious. We had a ravioli that was too die for. A lemon chicken with capers, I think. There was also like a lasagna or something. I don't know but everything was good and just really above average. The girl sitting next to me hated seafood and wouldn't try a few things so she kept complaining but seriously grow up and eat some damn fish! This place is great. The atmosphere is homey and a little cheesy with Italian music playing. The lighting was dark and the table cloths where red and white checkered. I loved everything about this restaurant!",

The wait staff was young but knowledgeable, friendly and helpful but never intrusive. I had the linguine di mare which was perfectly prepared. It was mildly spicy and contained a nice mixture of lobster, shrimp, mussels and clams. Though I found it very generous with the lovely shrimp, I found it less than generous with the lobster - I found one small piece on my plate. The clams and mussels were tasty but rather small. One of my companions had the seared tuna which he very much enjoyed. The portion was large and was cooked perfectly medium rare with an ideal 1/8 inch seared thickness all around and a rare center. My other companion had the Parmesan crusted tilapia. It was well cooked and tasty. We accompanied our dinner with a bottle of their nice house chianti. For dessert, the three of us shared a generous and quite delicious order of the cannoli cake. With two rounds of drinks and tip, the bill was $240 for the three of us. A very enjoyable experience well suited to a special occasion.",

I called on Sunday (12/30/18) & made reservations for 8PM on Friday (1/4/2019) The girl on the phone took down my first & last name, which I spelled out for her, and my phone number. I told her the dinner was for my husbands birthday & we'd like a table with a view of the strip if able, but if not I understand.  Fast forward to Friday, my husband & I show up hungry at 7:50PM. We inform the hostess we had a reservation, she asks for our name, which again I spell out for her... nothing. Can't find us by first name, last name, or time. I give her my phone number which is a match, but our first & last name got completely butchered and her attitude about not being able to find our reservation at first was off putting. Anyways, the hostess tells us she will text me when our table is ready. We wait at the bar until 8:20, which is 20 minutes past our reservation time, 30 minutes since we have been waiting. I am getting impatient because I've seen multiple walk in customers get seated since we have been waiting & it's now 20 minutes past our reservation which is unacceptable. 10 minutes past, I understand. Things get busy. Not 20 minutes.  So I go up to the hostess stand & ask politely if our table is ready, it's now 20 minutes past our reservation. The hostess says \"almost ready\" & I sit back down at the bar. 10 minutes later, I get a text that our table is ready.  So.... 30+ minutes past our reservation time, we are seated. Our table was positioned in such a way, we had no view of the strip... only Maggiano's outside patio. What a let down to wait so long & still get a crappy view. My husband & I are irritated and hungry at this point. Our waiter is the only thing that made the experience OK & not a total disaster.   Free bread & oil = warm, soft, tasty  Moscato Mojito = $11 is steep but tasted great Bruschetta = very small servings, not much flavor. In my opinion, it's not worth it.  Fettuccine Alfredo = tasty, just not worth the price   There were multiple birthdays around us... some got candles with desserts, some were serenaded by a musician with \"Happy Birthday\" songs on the guitar. We got nothing.   Again, not a huge deal for us ~normally~ but I took my husband out to Maggiano's because I expected his birthday dinner experience to be special. I expected a higher standard of professionalism from the establishment & see no reason to return   I've stayed in Italy for 5 months and can tell you, the food is mediocre for the price. Go somewhere else.",

After ordering and eating the food, we were all stuffed. The server came around to offer the dessert menu and when we turned it down, his attitude completely changed!

We waited for 30 mins before he brought us the starter bread basket , I even had to ask a manager that I noticed was standing behind our booth for it as well. The table across from us had a different server & was seated at least 20 mins after us . They received their bread & food before us.   I totally understand that they close at 11 and the server was probably ready to go home but it was shocking to see how attended to the  the table across from us was & how MIA our server  was .  Aside from  the service being horrible the food was great. We started w/ the salmon cakes (kind of came out cold) which were good. I ordered  the chicken Parm & my bf had the filet mignon and risotto w/ a side of mashed potatoes , both of them were very good.  We decided not to order drinks since the service was slow from the very beginning .   I'd recommend this place based on the food quality but the service definitely fell short.",

They were always very responsive with my questions and concerns through email. I did have a little trouble closer to the event finalizing some details but the assistant general manager stepped in and took care of everything. My guests could not believe the affordable price we paid for such an amazing reception. I would recommend his venue to anyone looking for a classy, intimate and beautiful venue.",

    "text": "Located on the upper level of the Fashion Show Mall, Maggiano's is a great Italian gem. They are always busy, but it's worth the wait. The restaurant has a very romantic feel to it, but can fit any type of occasion, from birthdays to first dates to family dinners to celebrations of seemingly any kind. There is outdoor seating available where you get a prime view of the beautiful Strip. The service is prompt and friendly. Our hosts/hostesses have always been quick on checking on us and refilling our waters. The food itself is pricey, but so delicious and there are a few unique menu items that I haven't seen anywhere else. These include chicken saltimbocca and the chicken francese. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh because the taste reflects it. Finishing off your meal with creme brulee is a great option and something I always choose. I also like the little touch that they add to their to go boxes in regards to refrigerating and reheating your leftovers. I love Maggiano's.",

They had decent sauce flavoring but they disintegrated in your mouth and didn't hold any firmness like normal mussels, not sure what they were or where they were from?  Skip the Vegas location and go to the ones in the Midwest or just skip the calamari/mussels altogether and call it a day.",

Because she was underage she couldn't obviously sit at the bar so we decided to sit with her at a table next to the bar so she wouldn't be alone. One of the waitresses was very rude and kicked us out of the table. She indicated that the tables were for full service and if we were going to be seated that we needed to order something. I told her we had ordered from the bar, and she still kicked us out. She was rude and totally disrespectful.  I hope the manager can provide some training.",

    "text": "My daughter and I were having a girls day and she really wanted lobster or crab Alfredo or something with seafood and pasta.  And we were. both crazy hungry bordering on \"hangry\"!  Since we were nearby, at Canyon Ranch SpaClub in the Venetian hotel I thought we'd stop in and try Maggiano's.  Our server wasJoey, he was thoughtful, down to earth and helpful with our decision and accommodating our tastes.  We started with the calamari which was golden, lightly salted and the perfect crispness that we like in a calamari. Next, we had the Linguine de mare, loaded with clams, mussels, meaty shrimp and bits of lobster, this portion was very generous and I'm glad we shared because we took the rest home which would feed one more!  We also had the side of chopped salad with the bleu cheese, bacon, tomatoes, avocado and dressing, we only had a few bites and took the rest home. My daughter REALLY wanted dessert so she ordered their special, Joey described it as a s'mores pie, she was sold.  There was a Graham cracker crust which was delicious but hard to cut through, the next layer was this amazing,silky, melt in your mouth chocolate ganache and the top layer was marshmallow which was caramelised by a torch, it tasted more like meringue than marshmallows so maybe I didn't hear the description correctly. The ambiance is very nice inside and I loved the outdoor seating. It was fun watching all the tourists having a good time on Cinco de Mayo!   P.S. We left Maggiano's so full that we had to walk around, Fashion Show is a great mall to enjoy. Also, you'll save money because you're too full to try anything on!!!",

The shortcake was cool 'cause it was house made cream, strawberries and marbled pound cake. Pasta was good. The customer service was amazing and friendly including from the managers who came up and checked to make sure everything was okay.

Our waiter, Billy, was very friendly and made us feel like valued guests--almost as if he had invited us into his home. I wanted a glass of wine to start but I didn't know what to order from the large selection of wines on the menu. Billy was able to make an excellent recommendation by asking me a few questions about what I like. I wish I could remember what it was :(  I ordered the Taylor Street Baked Ziti which comes loaded with Italian Sausage, Pomodoro Sauce, and an Italian cheese blend. Just thinking about it again makes me want to Fed Ex an order of it to Edmonton right now. But Canadian Customs would probably eat it all at the airport.  The selection of entrees at Maggiano's is large and it was difficult making a choice of which to order. The Baked Eggplant Parmesan, Chef Mann's Country-Style Pasta, Chicken Parmesan, etc. are all on my radar for future visits to this restaurant. In addition to pasta there is a decent sized seafood menu.  The portions are large and the prices are right. It's $15 - 20 on average for the pasta dishes with the seafood being around $21 - 30 (unless it's lobster tails then you're paying more).  Maggiano's is clearly about creating a delicious, comfortable experience that makes customers want to return. That is such a rarity in today's corporate culture which simply treats consumers like a number. I can't wait to return to this restaurant.",

My girlfriend ordered Rigatoni D, and I must say it was by far way better than my steak it's nice an creamy I definitely recommend it as well.",

Despite me not caring for my original main course selection, the assistant GM Karna Patel really showed his professionalism by personally coming out immediately to make sure our table was content. Our group works in different high end dealerships. We know excellent customer service and satisfaction when we see it.  Receiving that type of care whether or not the food was perfect or not makes a big difference. Daniel is a True asset to this establishment. We wish him much success in his career here.  On a different note, their stuffed mushrooms were perfectly cooked.  The Chicken Parmesan was very succulent and perfectly seasoned.  And the butter cake is to die for.

Food was amazing, I love italian food and I wish we had a place like this in SWFL.    Their portions is enough for 2 & trust me I eat a lot! If we compare the food & prices to other places, you must go here. Usually a plate of food in Vegas is in the range of $30-$60. Margianno is definitely affordable  $20-$30 per plate. Remember they serve a lot & please ask the server they are really helpful.  Would totally recommend Margianno's!!!",

I did like some of the new pasta options that were added to the Family style options. The service is always prompt and friendly. Our waiter Robert was great!

After asking the waiter what he would recommend, he had Chef Eric come to our table to talk about what dishes would best fit my dietary recommendations. He took my order on a bright yellow order pad and said it would be prepared separately. They have gluten free pasta and the meat sauce is dairy free. Everyone was so helpful and my meal was fabulous. Hubs got the regular spaghetti & meatballs and said was delish. Both meals came out at the same time and we enjoyed our dinner very much. Price very reasonable compared to the pricey resorts.

She wasn't overly formal which is a weird pet peeve of mine. Our waters were always full, drinks refilled and table clean.    Onto the food. We started with the zucchini appetizer which was all kinds of amazing! They were lightly dusted with parmesan cheese and served with a lemon aioli of some sort. Very delicious. My boyfriend thought they had a little too much batter, but I thought they were perfect. We asked for a side of marinara or meat sauce with the app and our server gladly brought us a little of both. They too were very good! Very different from each other which I thought was nice.  I ordered the Chicken Francese, I think that's how it's spelled, with angel hair pasta instead of the potatoes. It was a lemon chicken with a parmesan crust and what I would describe as a light creamy mushroom sauce. Idk but it was good! Not too lemony or heavy on the sauce and the perfect portion. I saved one chicken breast to take home because I wanted some later.  My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni d which he was really disappointed with.  It had an odd sweet flavor to it. We took most of it home with us and never touched it after that.   Overall it was a good experience! I definitely will be back to try something new!",

Our service was great once we were sat though.  Seidi our waitress was great. She made some recommendations and my husband and I were both completely satisfied. I had the chicken piccata and he had the parmesean. She recommended the lite on each and the hand made pasta was to die for. Definitely changed my pasta opinion as this was my first hand made pasta. Wonderful.   Although I wasn't too impressed with the snotty hostess team, the rest of the staff changed my opinion as well as the meal itself. I feel bad only giving a 4 stars due to the first impression.",

Complimentary bread and butter / olive oil, which was probably the best part of dinner.  Got the crab cakes appetizer, which was tasty.  I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions and husband got chicken marsala. My entree was tender and cooked to perfection, and tasted good at first,  if a little monotonous.   Husband's (birthday boy) entree was a total failure. He asked to substitute the standard spaghetti aglio olio with spaghetti meat sauce,  which didn't happen. The chicken was as tough as shoe leather, the sauce didn't taste at all of marsala wine,  and the mushrooms had hardly any evidence of being cooked.  Considering we were here for his birthday,  it was pretty disappointing. Still, service was nice enough, and location, and cleanliness can't be faulted.",

The food was delicious. We had a spinach/artichoke dip amazing! I tried both of the frozen peach belinis one regular peach and the other with a raspberry swirl wine was my fave. Also, the alfredo for hubby was good. I had the Chicken/Shrimp Tuscan Pasta which was very flavorful. I took it home and warmed it up the next day and it was great plus it still held its creamy texture. Can't wait to come back again",

We also ordered the tomato basil soup, not the best soup Ive had, it's too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil. For our entree we got the chicken Marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried. I had the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken. My Alfredo sauce was alright, not my favorite I think Olive Garden has better Alfredo fettuccine. Overall not bad for lunch but for Italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice!",

The seafood pasta was loaded clams, shrimp,lobster, and muscles in a rich red sauce. Absolutely delicious. The spaghetti and meatball is also amazing, it comes with a huge, tasty meatball. The portions are big so it's best to come hungry and share an entree. It's obvious that this establishment uses fresh, quality ingredients. Our waiter, Mark, was the absolute best and so on top of everything. Everyone was so nice and I especially loved guy who greeted each table with beautiful songs. This was without a doubt the best place we have eaten during our stay. The atmosphere is classy but without the snobbishness and the view of the strip is also a plus. Best to make a reservation.",

I ate at the Maggiano's in Scottsdale AZ, and I was so unimpressed with that one, that I almost did not come here.  But since it was convenient for our wedding party, I stuck with it.  I am so happy that I kept our reservations here.  We had Calamari and the Spinach Dip for appetizer.  Next came the Ceasar and Chopped salad.   For the pasta course, we had Mom's Lasagna and Chicken Tortellini.  For main course; Chicken Parmesan and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.  And finally for dessert, Tiramisu and the Apple Crostada.  It was ALOT of food.  And it was all very very good.  There was not a single dish that I did not like.  I thought all the dishes were amazing. I guess I was a little surprised because I really thought it was just gonna be ok, decent food.",

Once seated I was greeted by an amazing server.  A kind Italian man, who was very efficient.  This place was extremely clean with a wonderful atmosphere.    This may be a chain, but I didn't know that until reading reviews before I posted my own.  They do not come off as a chain restaurant to me.  Now compare them to Olive Garden....Not really anything to compare!!  Maggiano's takes it hands down.  The food was rich and tasty.  Salad was decent size, with an amazing dressing that had a touch of spiciness.  I ordered a few glasses of wine and the bill came to around $60.  Definitely worth the money!! I will be back for sure!",

And the carb loading!).  We were looking for somewhere close to Treasure Island at a reasonable price, and Maggiano's fit the bill. We made reservations through Open Table and were seated at our scheduled time.  The inside of the restaurant was quite nice but the tables are soooooo close together, I kept bumping into the guy behind me.  There was a large party of obnoxious loud people, but this tends to be the case at a lot of places in Vegas.  We split the bruschetta as an appetizer, and while it was delicious, for the price I was expecting a bit more.  However, they made up for portion sizes with the entrees!  My eggplant parmesam was posetively massive, but still elegantly served which I appreciated.  Another in our party had the chicken tortelloni's and the two others had the gnocchi.  Honestly, mine was pretty good but I liked everyone else's selections better.  Maybe I just chose something I wasn't in the mood for.  The bill was reasonable for Vegas and the meal served its primary purpose.  However, in comparison to alot of other places, it was just okay, and I wouldn't add it to my \"must visit while in Vegas\" list.",

Food was heavy loaded with sauces and it's obvious there are lots of can openers in the kitchen.   Now believe it or not when you have 15-20 people they serve a family style dinner and the food is a higher quality and the good pasta's, the sausage &pepper appetizer is great! But the most impressive is the deserts...what a presentation! and delicious.  There house Chianti is great for the price, I highly recommend it.

We sat for a good 15 minutes without him refilling any drinks or taking our order. But we requested another waitress and Sarah was amazing! She more than made up for the lack of service. If everyone was like her it would be a 5 star for sure!",

I had a reservation in the lunch hours, and I was on time and on my reservation notes, I proposed a booth. It wasn't ready when I got there so we had to take a timer and stand around.  30 minutes later we got the booth, and it was facing outside which was a good view. This is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. The booth took way to long to get and even when I put it for in advance.  The server was nice and quick, and explained the menu just right.  The food was amazing! I love italian food and decided to go with lasagna, and it was hot and fresh tasting. It wasn't a loud place and was very clean. I wil love to come back to try something else on the menu.",

Our pasta main course was undercooked, although every dish had sat under the heat lamps/salamander too long. So, tough ravioli, penne (wheat) undercooked but meatball was pretty good. Since we were guests, we did not send anything back. I guess it's just difficult for a well established and popular restaurant to consistently produce good food. But that just doesn't make any sense does it?  What makes more sense is that they get so many customers they'll likely never see again, quality doesn't matter. Good thing there is Yelp.",

Everything on the plate was soggy, tasteless and gross. I realize one shouldn't order roasted chicken at an Italian place, hence why this place gets 3 stars instead of 2!!  Overall not a bad place to dine on the strip but with so many fabulous options in Vegas it's hard for me to endorse this place. Boring and corporate come to mind. For Italian I prefer Nora's.",

Likewise, the cab off the holiday menu is a decent $50 bottle...and they give away a branded carafe for using the menu.  Tip: for easy access, use valet parking on the north side off Fashion Show Dr. then hop into the exterior elevator for a quick ride to the restaurant.",

    "text": "My what a difference a year makes...both in how I write Yelp reviews and in my Maggiano's experience. I was back at Maggiano's for a private event and this time it was much better. Yes, they serve the dishes family style. Yes, you pay a slightly inflated price I attribute to the unofficial Strip surcharge. You get past all that and you'll find some good food here.   On this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more: Crispy Zucchini Fritte. The zucchini is a diet killer. Calorie counting? Yeah, forget about that. Just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does.   The rest of the items I tried today were good, but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me. The Fettuccine Alfredo was respectable, not the best I've ever had but it certainly was filling and I sneaked in a second small helping of it. The Chicken Piccata was actually disappointing. I masked my disappointment by having more Caesar salad and where did that Zucchini go again?   One note to the staff...the Lemon Cookies were too cold. But the Apple Crostada made me forget all about the cookies...  As this was a business function, the Maggiano's staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that I work with. All things considered 4 Stars seems appropriate.   Almost forgot to mention one more thing. The Valet seems super slow here. If you're in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly.",

    "text": "I came here a couple months ago during my vacation in Las Vegas. I was skeptical to try Maggiano's out since they were a chain restaurant but I would be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately no locations in Canada (where I'm from) yet! This Maggianos is located in the Fashion show mall next to Wynn and Encore Hotels.   Maggiano's isn't exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. It has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the Wynn hotel and that part of the strip. While we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. And to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!  The menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. Along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. Basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! Its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. We ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.  Maggiano's Salad :  This salad is literally the best salad I've ever had! The signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, I could NOT for the life of me stop eating this!  Crispy Zucchini Fritte :  The waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and I can see why. The zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip  Linguine and Clams with White Clam Sauce:  I did not like this at all. The sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. It was way too salty.  Our Famous Rigatoni 'D'  :  guess they don't call it \"Famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! The pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy Marsala sauce.   For a chain, this place really isn't bad! You'll leave for the most part happy and full :)",

    "text": "Again, not impressed, although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience. I am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. I should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. My husband and I were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.  First off, service was a tad better this time around. Our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. I have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the Happy Hour price. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. Happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the Marsala sauce that is very unlike his Italian grandmothers.  Appetizers:  Calamari Fritte, served with marinara. It was fried Calamari. Luckily though it was not soggy or gross. It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app.   Spinach & Artichoke Al Forno - I am a fan of artichokes in apps. My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. However, I was not impressed with this dip. It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had.  Crab & Shrimp Cannelloni ($18.50) - Ugh! What a waste of money. This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce. Literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. The menu description says this, \"Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". No. There were no breadcrumbs. My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone Cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. I was incredibly disappointed in this dish.  I wish I had gotten the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!  Creme Brulee ($7.95) - A huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. Okay, I'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. The dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. My husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and I was left to eat the rest of it.  Again, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped Italian food on The Strip. It's a chain Italian restaurant I will continue to avoid.",

    "text": "I came here for the first time Sept 2011 with a group of 5. Like everyone says, its romantic, has great views of the strip, great service and the food is FANTASTIC.   I had the fried calamari and eggplant parmesean and it was the best eggplant parmesean I've had so far. Everybody else really liked their food too, although I didn't get to try it. However I will be going back. Not to repeat what loads of others have said, so here's my recap:  Pros: -Really good food -Nice ambiance and views -Easy to get to (Fashion Show Mall), cabs can just drop you off curbside in front of the restaurant. -Surprisingly affordable! For the same cost as going to Bucca or Il Fornaio, this food kicks those places butts! (In my opinion =) -The service was great. Super friendly wait staff and very helpful with the menu.  Cons: -Not really a place to bring little ones as its kind of a \"romantic\" and quiet atmosphere, but I'm sure you could have them here.",

It's over 100 degrees today in Vegas and my friend had on a cotton cover with a tube top underneath. Because it was considered \"beach attire\" and she \"was not fully clothed\" we could not eat at this establishment. I find this highly disrespectful. There was a women outside with her breasts exposed enjoying their food out on their patio. It should not matter how anyone looks...no one should be turned away. I will not be back to any Maggiano's location again. I am disgusted. I'll spend my money elsewhere.",

And don't forget to dip the bread in the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and some cheese to it For great service ask for.Nick. Nick is warm and friendly and goes the extra mile to make his customers happy. In my opinion service is as important as good food. You can have good or great food.  But you must have equal service to make the experienc.   Today is April 14, 2019. I came to Maggiano's for a simple pasta dish. But you can't find a simple pasta dish on the menu unless you ask because that menu is hidden inserted behind the top menu.  When you get the pasta, it is pre-cooked pasta from yesterday or at best this morning  and hot tomato sauce is placed over the top. I'm very disappointed.  One way to get fresh cooked pasta is to ask for it al-dente.  So I sent it back and asked for pasta al-dente.  It came out uncooked. Usually ziti is yellow when uncooked and it is almost white and slightly firm  when properly cooked. The pasta came out yellow and hard.   Sent it back.  Finally Jees the assistant general manager came out.   We talked but I did not eat the food. But I give Jesse credit for the time he spent talking to me about these event.   My take is as follows:  because the restaurant has an Italian name, please Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin Song's Does not make it an Italian restaurant.",

Overall I really enjoyed dinner here, however I found it pretty expensive given what we ordered. We had the calamari which had a few chewy pieces, also ordered the chicken Marsala and lobster carbonara (the size was large but it was a basic Alfredo sauce, with just green beans and lobster so fairly unimpressive there. Overall nice time, good location and service but good could be improved a bit for the price of it.",

We had a great view of the strip with light and water shows, lots of eye candy to entertain us. The calamari was lightly breaded and just right, not at all chewy. The caesar salad was crisp and fresh. I had the salmon on a bed of spinach and side of angel hair pasta paired with a Sonoma Chardonnay. The angel hair pasta was done with oil, garlic and butter and was delicious. It was a nice dish and perfect pairing recommended by our server. There was so much food that we all had leftovers to take home to our room. My friends ordered their regular dishes (they've been here many times before- chicken parmigiana and rigatoni D) and they were not disappointed. There was no room for dessert after fresh bread with oil and vinegar, calamari, salad and our meals. The food was good and the ambiance and service really made the experience. Shout out to Nestor and his excellent service last night!",

Service was on point as usual and the ambience beautiful by the windows.  Started us off with an amuse Bouche, if you will,from the chef of a little lemon tartlet.  Very lemony and tart with some sweetness.  Great little starter.  Then We had the Eggs Benedict, crab cake style and meatball style.  Both were delicious.  Eggs were poached perfectly.  Warm and runny with the whites perfectly cooked.  And not soggy at all.  Potatoes were crisp and delicious.  Overall another delicious meal.  But really wish they still offered lunch.  Definitely in the mood for their chopped salad and meatballs.",

    "text": "With having such strong reviews I was a little disappointed with this place. The food was alright, not super flavorful at all or worth the dime dropped.   The waiter was excellent, however the hostesses were unfortunately very unfriendly and rude. They didn't even lead us to our table they just pointed us where to go, in turn we got lost because this restaurant is quite large and bustling with waiters and waitresses between the many many tables on the floor.   After we got seated finally our experience was much more pleasant thanks to the waiter. I got the steak and ravioli special ($26) and was not impressed. The steak were little medallions about an inch thick and 3 inches in diameter but no flavor-- not even salt or pepper. The 3 raviolis were good but the stuffing was a little too salty for me (I am a little salt sensitive).   One of my friends had the carbonara special which is supposed to come with a poached egg, instead it arrived at our table as almost completely raw. The yolk was bright yellow and you could still see the clear jelly-like sac. The waiter graciously offered to redo it and bring another fresh on the house and did agree that is in no way a poached egg saying he could even poach one better than that.   My other friend got the piccata and said that california pizza kitchen piccata was better.   It smells delicious in here which is what attracted us to this place, but maybe we ordered the wrong things. I probably won't give this place another shot though, as there are too many good established restaurants I am aware of already.",

For dessert the waiter gave us the Veras lemon cookies as a courtesy for us celebrating our Anniversary. Very nice gesture. We sure will visit the LA location soon too. One thing id like to note. Maggianos is located at the Fashion Centers. Which is directly across the Wynn hotel. So it faces the Strip on the second floor. When using the maps app. It will take you to the Dillards direction so you will have to drive around.",

So my bf & I went to go find somewhere to sit & came back 30 mins later since that's what I had anticipated. It was 8:15 & this man started to get agitated with the women on the host stand because he checked in at 7:45 he says... so the lady just told him to stand by the light & someone will come get him. & obviouslyyyy, I'm standing here like... excuse me? I checked in 15 mins before you did & you get to be seated first????? Ok. We were seated at 8:20 - so 50 min wait. I don't mind waiting but I wish they told us it would be longer, yaknow? Anyways, that's why im giving 4 stars & not 5 lol.   I ordered the lobster carbonara. It was delicious! I wish they put broccoli instead of the peas but the peas were crisp & it was great! There wasn't a lotttt of lobster on there but it was a good amount. My bf had the Tuscan shrimp & chicken. It was pretty amazing too. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate zuccotto cake?

The cool, intimate environment of Maggiano's really set the tone for the night's coming festivities. I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which was basically linguine, and a pound of shrimp smothered in a creamy and spicy tomato sauce. It was good. I ate the entire plate - but it was certainly enough for two or three people. We had recently been engaged, and the waiter found out and brought us some handsome italian cookies and chocolates with a little candle to celebrate. The bread was good, the atmosphere was refined, and the seats were really comfy. It's a strange place, because it seems fancy from the outside, but when you go in, it's like you just walked onto the set of Cheers - where everybody knows your name.   There are a ton of places to eat in Vegas. But if you've got a hankerin' for solid Italian food, Maggiano's is the affordable and delicious spot on the strip. Located just underneath the giant metal UFO in the fashion district - which I assume brings the street performers to the Bellagio sidewalk every night. Once you climb the massive set of stairs, you'll find the restaurant, and also be in a great spot to people watch from on high.   Anyway, it's not the best Italian food I've had, but it's very far from \"just edible.\" I enjoyed my meal, and the total experience was great, but it was nothing life changing.",

He took excellent care of us an made sure our glasses were constantly full. The food was excellent, which I expected. We had plenty of leftovers to enjoy the next day ;)",

But other than that, our waitress was LOVLEY and one of the nicest waitresses we've ever had. I don't remember her name but she's originally from San Diego.",

(parking is also free in the underground parking garage which is a plus)  My group started with some drinks. I got the margarita which was so delicious I had to get another one. They give you fresh bread and olive oil/balsamic to start with.   We all ended up getting entree salads which were pretty good (nothing special) and they were very large so I would recommend to split it with someone. We ended off with the lemon cookies which were also very very good!",

They did have vegan options which was wonderful for me!! I ordered the salad, basil tomatoes as an appetizer, and the main entree was the spaghetti pasta. The food was delicious. I do wish they had an option of vegan bread...but I guess I'll live! The raspberry lemonade I ordered was so good. The waiter had excellent service and he knew a lot about the menu. I think it's important for the server to know all about the food. They had a guy going around playing the guitar. I thought that was cute. He asked us to play for us, but my Friend declined. It was still a nice gesture though. I would definitely come back here.",

That's how we ended up in Maggiano's.   For most let me say this;  I'm not a big fan of going to the strip because everything is double the price there! However Maggiano's make it worth the trip! Service is always excellent here and the ambiance is pretty cool! If you are lucky enough you can sit by the big window overlooking the strip! And that's what makes it worth the trip I think!   Food is very cheesy! Now if you are looking for something that would make you full in 2bites this is the place for you! I can definitely eat here once every 6months but no more than that! But don't get me wrong! It's just personal preference though on my part! But I prefer their bruschetta over everything else in the menu; it's super good! And the way the textures goes together in one bite! Yum.. all of them is a must try! Sweet savory and a bit bitter from little burn of the toast is pretty amazing!   We sat outside this time and was worried about service being a bit slow but we really had no problem! Service was pretty smooth!",

It was rich and light all at the same time! We also had the stuffed mushrooms which the waiter was nice enough to revise to be vegetarian since the sauce has a meat broth in it.  Along with a couple refreshing cocktails; I had the mushroom ravioli for my entree which was extremely decadent with a rich Alfredo sauce and my friend had the filet mignon which looked beautiful.  I highly recommend it!",

We started with 'dinner salads' they were perfect and larger than most restaurants serve.  I ordered the Chicken Piccata, he the Gnocchi !! So much Delicious food we had to ask for a box to carry back to our condo, looks like another great dinner tomorrow ! Rafael even put in another warm baguette without us asking, Super Nice !!!  Oh and we had to try the Carrot Cake Rafael had suggested, we were already full so one to split would be enough, WRONG !! The piece we received was Ginormous !!! OMG !!! We took half of that back to our place, great dessert tomorrow too !! You definitely won't be sorry you ate here !!!",

Sat at the bar while we waited for a table.... this is a popular spot. I'd recommend reservations if going on a Sat night like we were. The bartenders were friendly and prompt without being intrusive. The Blackberry Bourbon Sour was what I ordered, only $11 and was a great cocktail.  Pretty view of the Wynn from the window table at which we were seated. The bruschetta bar was fun--totally gets you to try something fun and new for like $2-3 and the portion is big enough that you and your date can each have a bite or two. Also, Eat the table side bread quickly--super yum when it's still hot!    Our server, Jaden, was friendly and extremely amenable to tweaking the ingredients to any dish if we had a food allergy--something that's tricky at many restaurants. He also knew the menu well and was able to provide insight into specific dishes.  I got the lobster carbonara and my friend got the chicken Romano. Both tasty and portions were huge! We could have split one and likely still had leftovers! Btw for picky eaters, they have things on the menu like spaghetti and fettuccini in addition to some more interesting dishes too and salads. They also tweak some of the pasta dishes to make it a 'lighter fare' option.   For such a big restaurant and its location on the strip, I thought the team here did great work, the prices were reasonable, and the quality was there.",

    "text": "The ambiance was my favorite part.  We made reservations around 6:30 pm on Saturday.  The earliest seating was at 9:15 pm.  We arrived at the fashion show mall, parked, and wondered our way out front to the entrance of Maggiano's.  I always love the atmosphere in these kind of places.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food, so don't read too much into my comments about the food.  The Calamari Fritte was a bit greasy with too much oil, but was overall pretty good.  The marinara dipping sauce was superb.  We also had stuffed mushrooms, which were really good.  They were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce.  My fiance and I shared a bowl of Linguine di Mare.  It had lobster, shrimp, clams, & mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth.  It was pretty good.  Lots of meat.  Very filling.  A man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic Italian song.  Simply romantic.  We had nice seats facing Las Vegas Boulevard.  We lingered a while after paying the bill, but the server stopped refilling our water.  This bothered me a little.  I was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough.  The bill was almost $60.  We had to take an alternate route back to the car because The Fashion Show Mall was closed.  I enjoyed this experience and would go again, but would prefer some place else because I'm not a big fan of Italian food.",

    "text": "I'm surprised this place has four stars, which I think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.  I came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). We showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. The table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. We ordered calamari, caesar salad, another type of salad (I think it was the Maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, chicken parmesan, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. The salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. The mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. The spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. It was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. The lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. It wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers.   The cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Mm!  The service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so I can understand.  I'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but I wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal.",

The staff pulled out all the stops to make sure we were well taken care of.  The food was like a flowing river of endless plates and our waiters did an excellent job of keeping us entertained.

It's conveniently located in the Fashion Show Mall...so after a day's shopping and gambling at the nearby Venetian and Palazzo...some Italian food sounded good. We went around 3PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We were immediately seated and service was prompt.   The appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and I would order these again. My dish was a Shrimp Risotto which wasn't a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  I thought it was good, but it didn't \"wow\" me.  I probably wouldn't order it again. My mom had a Beef Tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  I found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished I had ordered that instead. My brother ordered a Lobster Carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara's should have it.  I got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay. Overall, the meal was good and I would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  The prices here are not too bad.  About $60 for three of us including appetizer and drinks.",

I was in heaven the moment I stepped inside. Table wasn't ready as we were a little early so got a drink at the bar, the specialty cocktailes we're delicous. Went with a party of 13. They sat us in the \"wine\" room so we were all by ourselves, which was great as we didn't have to compete with the entire restaurant noise level, just ours. Since we had a large party we went with the \"Family style\" dining option. Went for the middle level (classic) choice of 3 appetizers/salad, 4 entrees and 2 desserts. Lots of choices so had to come up with an organized way to get 13 people to agree. Once we figure that out it was on. Chopped salad, fried mozerella and stuffed mushrooms to start. Brought three platters of each which was more than enough but, did I mentione, this is also all you can eat! So never a worry there wouldn't be enough to go around. On to the main course (and timing was perfect, staggered but not too slow). Breaded Tilapia, chicken marsala, Lasagna and linguine with white clam sauce. All were super flavorful and again we ahd more than enough on the first serving, no need for a second order. Dessert was delish as well, (profiteroles and an apple tart) although I could only fit a bite of each aftert all that good food.  Highly reccomend especialyl for a large party.",

We had so much food we couldn't do it all - I think it was one of the set menus here basically the food just keeps coming. We had beef medallions, lasagne, salads, pasta, the works, all very tasty, well prepared and served promptly and hot!  Can't fault it, have been here several times in Vegas and highly recommend it for a casual meal.",

The noodles were way over cooked and the oil used to cook the chicken had no appealing taste. I had the chicken francaise that was soaked in a butter sauce. No dish should be drowning in a butter sauce. The salad had wilted lettuce and over dressed. The service I will say was excellent but this in itself is not why I go out for dinner.  They say this is Italian food but can't imagine that any Italian would say this is good sauce.  Too many good Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas area to ever go back.",

It's great because you have a perfect view of the lights and hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered to go but had a glass of wine while I waited for my food to finish. The servers seemed really nice for the most part, although I didn't get the full service since I was ordering to go.   I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo (lighter version) with a side casear salad. The food was packed very nicely and thoroughly saran wrapped to keep from spilling. The salad was OK. Nothing too extravagant. The pasta was a nice portion, perfect to get full off of and then have leftovers for another meal. Also, they were very generous with the shrimp. Sadly, some of the shrimp tasted a little undercooked. I wasn't sure but the next morning when I was sick it was confirmed! Definitely may think twice before ordering seafood here!",

It was pretty busy, and it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come over and greet us after we were sat. When I've already completely decided my meal before I've even been offered a drink, I get a little impatient. That's the only reason I knocked a star off. The food came out within 20 minutes or so after we ordered, and we split chicken piccata, but unfortunately they didn't split it. I don't mind paying a split charge, especially when I specifically request a split. The size was ok, only 3 very small chicken breasts, but Macaroni Grill has definitely made us spoiled with portion sizes. I would return, as it was a nice atmosphere at a good price with decent service and yummy Italian food.",

It was nice not having to starve while waiting for our appetizer and entrees.   Also the customer service was great! Even though he was waiting more tables he was very attentive and courteous.   The food came out hot and fast and tasted great! We couldn't finish our pasta because we were so stuffed! They have large portions and my pasta was only 15 dollars! About the same price as Olive Garden but it was actually delicious. Believe it or not, our total was cheaper than the time we went to Olive Garden!   From the time we arrived to the time we left it was only 40 mins! So I'd say service was extremely fast, especially since they were busy that night.

We opted for a dinner service that included passed appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, a dessert table and an open bar for 4 hours. The guests said they were stuffed, and they really enjoyed the open bar. The staff was attentive and did an excellent job. They even ordered in a special alcohol at the request of my husband. The meal and bar package was amazingly priced and when you add in a beautiiful view of the strip it made for a memorable night. Thank you for taking such good care of our guests!

Were quick to get our drink order and it quicker with our food, the calamari for appetizer was glorious. I had the lobster carbonara and I absolutely loved it, keep in mind there actually big portions so I wasn't able to finish it. Got a to go box for sure, you don't let good things like that go to waste. My friend got the ravioli,  he was pleased with but seemed like a smaller portion it had like six or seven or so raviolis seem to fill him up though. Bread they brought out with the balsamic  was amazing I now want to go to the store and do that for myself. I very much enjoyed this last night and intend on going back, today I went to Hooters for lunch and even though I'm stuffed from it I have the lobster carbonara in my fridge I refuse to go bad so that's what I'm eating now, i'm a fat ass.",

Only mine. -__-   First time was a big ass spill..next one went on my bread..third one went on my meal. Come on maaayynn.   BUT THE FOOD WAS BOMB DIGGITY!  Went to Maggiano's for me, and 2 other friend's birthday dinner with everyone! They have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food. But it's all you can eat. Doesn't really explain much,  but if you have a big group..I would suggest that you get that. (Although we didn't order it..lol)   Service was pretty good. We got some toasty warm bread (yum) and their butter is so  yums!  I ended up ordering the chicken & spinach manicotti. SOOO CREAMY..SO DELIIICIOUS! Comes in 3 decent sized pieces, and I just wanted to savor every bite.   It's really quiet in there..none of the other customers talk, so for the most part, my friends and I were the entertainment of the night.   We were seated in the back right corner, so we are able to see the other hotels and what not. All of a sudden, we see 4 cop cars chasing this white car, and it stopped right in front of our view. All of us got up and it was so intense!!!  The police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground. Ohmygah. That was good stuff.   Also, I can't fail to mention..we all got to go boxes and bags..and we took some pictures outside. This was towards the hotels, so away from Maggiano's. My friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her Coach wristlet inside. We were all facing away..when we were done with the picture, she asked where her bag was. We had no idea.. I said to not worry, cause it's just her food..but none of us knew her credit card, iD, and other important things were in it.   ANYONE could've taken it! LUCKILY. One of our friends saw 2 homeless men downstairs carrying a Maggiano's bag, and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and Coach wristlet!   Friend's bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said, \"GIMME THAT BAG!\" & the homeless guy was pissed, but gave it back. If it wasn't for our one friend who saw him, we would've never found it.   Just wanted to share the crazy experiences from Maggiano's :]   But I would definitely suggest this place! It's really good. Tried all of my friend's food..and perfecto!",

Located in the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has easy access and parking. It has a great location.   The ambiance is just like every other Maggianos, with only about 1/3 of the tables having a view of the strip. We had made reservations for 8:00pm on a Wednesday night, and arrived 10 minutes late. Granted the restaurant was packed as ever, but there were empty tables. The Maitre de gave us such a stern look of disapproval and then gave us a buzzer to wait near the bar. We waited for almost another 25 minutes, are you kidding me?   When we were finally seated at a table in the back, it took us way longer than expected to get the attention of the waiter to take our order. Maybe they have a problem with the ratio of tables per waiter. We could see that he was working hard, but we were hungry as well! The food was delicious, as expected. All of us were stuffed and enjoyed our meal. We actually loved the two elderly men who came to sing at our table =) The one with the Violin reminded us of the man in UP. With such good food, we were happy to have several boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day.   But then, at the end of the night when we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter to split the bill amongst the guests. One of our friends actually paid in cash and the waiter actually assumed that his bill was his tip. This is before we got the receipt back to sign. The waiter assumed, and gave himself a 25% tip! That has never happened to me before, and sadly I have to say he didn't deserve it. Overall we had a great time and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope they would improve on their service between then.",

So when we were in vegas for my birthday we decided to head their for our lunch before we headed back to Cali.   We ordered our meal after awhile because the server was being erratic and then after twenty minutes or so we got our appetizer.  After we recieved it they asked us to move to another table towards the middle and we had to carry our own food and dishes over.  Then after another twenty minutes or so we received our food.  Too bad when we said \"no marinera' on my besties pasta and confirmed that we are sorry but to please substitute and she glady said it was no problem it of course came out with marinera.  However it took so long in the first place for our food to arrive so my bestie stuck to it.  THEN what happened is unbelievable..they actually started VACUUMING right behind us.  Back and Forth Back and Forth with NO warning what-so-ever which I don't even know if it would have made it any better.  After 5-10 minutes...YES SERIOUSLY the couple behind us asked to get the check because they couldn't stand it.  After the whole ordeal our server comes out as if she just realized the vacuum had been on and asks if we want to move.... NO IDIOT THE DUST ALREADY FLEW UP AND LANDED SAFELY ON MY FOOD. I DONT WANT TO EAT NOW I WANT TO GET OUT...   apparently they had their carpet cleaned and they needed to vacuum the moisture out....As if that could not wait until another time????  what a dissappointment.  So I asked her for their card so I could leave corporate a comment.  I didn't get to it until a month or so later and they said it was too late to leave a comment but too bad I still did.  After my comment I didn't receive any notice that they received my comment.  I am NOT looking for free comps or anything of that nature I just want them to understand that is NOT what I expected in a restuarant...it reminded me of those annoying sweepers in cafeterias/fastfood joints.

    "text": "OK. I am not  a connoisseur of  Italian eateries, but I have been to enough  Italian restaurants in my time to give a solid review. First, my friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday evening 3 days in advance. We get to the restaurant at 6:55pm and the hostess gave  us the pager gadget and says it will be a few minutes. Half an hour later, we still have not been seated yet. I wonder why we  even bothered to make reservations. In my book, you make a reservation for a certain time and when that time comes,  you get seated. that is the point of making a RESERVATION and the basic meaning of the word. This is a big NO NO in my book. That is either poor planning or mismanagement or both. If I am gonna spend some bills in a fancier style restaurant, I expect to be taken care of. that is what I am paying for and have no problem doing so.  The silver lining ,if there is one, is that we weren't the only ones. there were numerous folks there having the same frustrations and issues with this topic and wishing to speak to the manager. Not a good sign. the waitress was nice enough and adequate though. the only issue I had with her is that we got our vinegar and oil for our bread, but guess what, no bread. only after 20 minutes and asking did we receive our bread. again, not what I expect from a  purported higher class establishment. the food was adequate but not what I would call earth shattering. the calamari was tasty and the Rigatoni D was tasty and sauce was good. I have had better and worse.  my friends all liked what they got from what they told me. Overall, mediocre experience at best.One thing I have learned over the years is that  you can tell a lot about a place by the way they keep the bathrooms and I must say that was horrible and maybe the worst I have ever seen except for a few roadside gas stations in my days. It  was an absolute mess with dirty paper towels, water, all over the floor and overall condition to be filthy. again, I hope they don't keep the kitchen like the do the restroom. I don't even want to think about that.  Overall, not a horrible experience but not one for the books either. In my opinion, Carrabas easily matches and super cedes Maggianos overall for a much better eating experience and price. Oh,  Almost forgot, I will give a 4 or 5 on the overall ambiance and feel of the restaurant.  It was a comfortable and luxurious setting, and decorated nicely but unfortunately, the wrapping on the package was much better than the gift inside.",

    "text": "Horrible. The rudest staff and establishment I have ever dealt with. I booked my reservation a few days ahead of time for 7:45 pm. Due to Las Vegas traffic and a double overtime basketball game I attended, our party arrived at approximately 7:55. I checked in to the front desk and said hello. To which I was not greeted and immediatly asked for the reservation name. I provide the name and am told that due to my lateness, keep in mind I am 10 minutes late to a reservation at a restaurant, they marked me as a no show and notified the yelp reservation site. At this point I am already annoyed, but I am on vacation and starving so I state the reason for my 10 minutes of tardiness. I continue and ask if we  can get another table. The \"greeter\" says I will have to wait at the end of the line for an hour to two hour  wait . I am still calm at this point and oblige to stand and wait. A minute passes and a heavy set supervisor type asks my party to move from the desk area. We move over to the corner by a coat rack. Another minute passes, the supervisor again states to move away from the coat rack area also. With my patience drawing low, I move over again to another open spot in the corner. After a couple minutes the supervisor AGAIN states to move away from this new spot. Not once does he show us another place to stand, nor does he say please or  thank you or anything but move. Rather, he comes off as annoyed at the fact that we are occupying space and breathing within the reastaurant. Finally, we have had enough and call the manager . A \"manager type\" scaddadles over after about 15 minutes and says whats wrong. We tell him the situation and he coldly replies that he is busy and the we missed our reservation time. Also so, he has no suggestion as to where to stand and wait in the restaurant. We left. Ridiculous service by a faux Italian establishment that has not the slightest idea about Italian culture, gratitude or hosting. They are obviously solely interested in getting you in and out as fast as possible. You are not a customer to them, you are another number to stuff with chef boyardee noodles at $20 a pop.",

    "text": "Oh no, Maggiano's, what is happening to you?  This used to be a GREAT place to eat, with delicious food, wine, good atmosphere and service.  Sadly, about a year ago when I was in LV and I ate there with my partner the food was just OK and we felt it was overpriced for the quality. I felt the same when I was there again last October.  Still, I have eaten there almost every trip I take to LV so I went again a few days ago. This time, YIKES!  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and I could barely eat it.  I wonder if it was stored in the kitchen for a while or what, because I could only eat a few bites.  It was sitting on top of spaghetti which was (weird and tasted) just OK.  Before my main meal I had tomato bisque soup which was very salty.  I was so disappointed in the meal.  My waiter was rather scattered.  I had to ask him four times for some butter for my bread. I will say he was friendly and did his best.  I think he could tell I did not like the food as he did give me some lemon cookies from their bakery when I asked for my check.  I will say those were delicious, but I wasn't there for cookies.  I don't think I will come back to eat at Maggiano's unless the locals tell me that the restaurant has improved and is back on track. I'm sad to give this review as I really used to love Maggiano's, and that is why it gets two stars instead of one.   :-(",

Hey, I love Maggiano's and when you know there's a good place to eat (whether it's Vegas, Boston, Philly, etc) you stick to it! As always, they never disappoint me.  I ordered the same stuff as I always do- their mussels for appetizer and of course, I always order chicken and spinach manacotti, which is yummy.

There's really good spaghetti, Fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli (my favorite with or without greens), and chicken Parmesan. They also have this stuff called onion strings (like a small, classy plate of mini, entangled onion rings) that is cravable, especially with the creamy, lemonish sauce. You have to ask for it on the side, though, or you may not get it. The atmosphere is really nice, too, especially if you're in the room surrounded by windows (unless someone suicidal brought a pet rock as their date). They give you a dessert on your birthday. They used to be lemon cookies, but I think they changed it to cake. I don't particularly like the desserts, but my family LOVES those lemon cookies! Overall, this is one of the best Italian places.

We went here about 3 years ago and wanted a nice dinner after watching \"KA\" and it was a nice walk to get there and we only waited about 20 mins. We got seats near the window with a wonderful view of the Vegas strip. If you're gonna compare chain Italian restaurants, \"Maggiano's\" little Italy is much better than \"Olive Garden\".

We were told that we HAD to order off the family style menu even though the menu clearly states that they \"ASK parties of 10 or more to order Family Style.\" There was no mention anywhere that this was required.  After asking if it was possible to order individual entrees, the hostess looked at us like we were stupid and asked \"why?\"  I simply stated we all have different tastes and one person in our party had food allergies.  Then what looked like the manager came over and told us that the kitchen could not accommodate a group of ten individual entrees and that the only way we could do that is if we split into two groups of five HOWEVER this would make the wait even LONGER.  We were confused because the kitchen would still be making ten orders but whatever.  We were annoyed with them already and decided to leave and check out El Segundo Sol, the Mexican restaurant right below Maggiano's.

Everyone at the table was satisfied with their dishes (fettuccine alfredo, baked ziti and sausage, some type of seafood pasta -- it was on the Little Italy Favorites menu).  I ordered the eggplant parmesan which I wasn't too fond of.  I found it to be too breaded and mushy, not what I'm used to.  Otherwise, great atmosphere, great prices.

    "text": "This is literally my favorite restaurant in Vegas. As a True Italian and eating REAL home cooked Italian food my whole life, it is sometimes hard to find a place that can compare to grandma's cooking.   The service here is ALWAYS amazing (I go often.) It doesn't matter what you get, you will enjoy it. I recommend the Raviolis and their house salad (yuuum!)   There's a little \"secret\" that isn't such a secret anymore.. After you are seated, ask for the \"Family Style\" menu. They'll bring you a totally different menu with great prices and it's all \"family style.\" They'll keep bringing you more and more of what you want until you ask to stop :) And I have tried everything on this menu and it's all delicious. I think the minimum you need to get family style is only three people. It is well worth it, I promise.  You gotta try this place! I promise you'll enjoy it!",

    "text": "We made reservations for Maggiano's through Yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  I would highly recommend making reservations through Yelp, if it has the option.  I believe it was linked to Foursquare?? Not sure though.    We took my mom out for a late Mother's Day dinner.  It wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  While, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  My husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  The glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  It was gross.  He told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  He gladly switched it out.    We went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  We got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  The ceasar and spinach salad.  The chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ meatballs and gnocchi w/ italian sausage.  Spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  My favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  I didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  The portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  I didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  Maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  The waiter was nice and service was quick.  View is nice...oversees the Wynn properties.  There is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which I believe you have to tip him.   It's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving Italian food.",

The menu options were original and everything we ordered was both extraordinarily flavorful and fresh.  We were there for lunch and the prices were a steal (for example, the $6 bruschetta was the size of a meal in itself and the wine by the glass was also reasonable by Vegas standards).    Our waiter was nothing special, but we wanted for nothing.  And while the dining experience for me is usually diminished when dining in a mall (even a Vegas mall), I found that the location was actually quite nice and lended itself to great views of the strip.  I would have liked to have tried the desserts but I hardly could finish my meal because of the large portions--I guess that means I'll have to go back.",

I would like to start by saying I've never had better service for a late Italian Dinner in my life.  We showed up at 10:00 and basically shut this place down, but not before we met the server of the century, Jake!  The food was outstanding and it was as if Jake new exactly what myself and my other wanted the moment we walked in.  Hands-down the best attention to detail I've experienced.    If you ever find yourself ready for a late Italian Dinner, this is the spot!  Ask for Jake, ask him a question and he has a long answer!   As for other highly rated main-stream Italian joints, they have nothing on this place and best part about it, below they have Dollar you call it drinks!  Enjoy!!!",

The dinner menu was pretty big. I saw the portions for dinner and they were huge. We ordered the stuff mushrooms as an appetizer and they came to our table in 5 minutes. A little too fast if you ask me. I hope they were not sitting under a heat lamp. Fettuccine in lobster sauce was pretty good. Chicken picatte fed two people just fine. The creamy chicken and potato soup was awesome. Next time, I will order a bowl.   Service - The service was good. Our waiter, however, wouldn't shut up. Don't you hate it when they keep trying to talk to you and just  go a bit too overboard and waaay too personal with the conversation. It was comment after comment. I could not really enjoy the  time with my friends. At first I felt bad but then I realized that he was borderline flirting with my girl friends. Especially in the end when my friend was trying to get out the booth and he extended his hand an exclaimed \" need some help miss\"? My friend politely said \"no thank you\". While I was thinking in my head \"WHAT A PERVERT\". To be honest, he probably gets off by touching women any chance he gets.   Minus one star for the server that wouldn't shut up.",

This place does get crowded so a reservation is suggested.    The food is ok...I have never had anything here that I would say was off the charts.  The prices are a little higher then you will find in other Italian places but its a chain and its on the strip.   The food is cooked good but there are a lot of items that are bland and under seasoned.  What makes up for the food is the ambiance and I am going to steal this part from my friend and fellow Yelper, Gregg W. who said this part best.     Classy, Rat Pack Music, Meticulously Clean, Upscale.  Men...wear a suit/tie or dress it down nicely casual, but certainly no flip flips and gym shorts here!    The dark wood interior walls have some nice old Las Vegas framed black n white photos. Tables are white cloth. Nicely dressed wait staff. Bathrooms even have cloth towels! Just a very classy Italian restaurant!  *Full bar w/ dining option.  **Happy Hour specials.  ***Reservations recommended for seating by floor to ceiling windows or prepare to go shopping and come back and wait some more, etc.    So I say you should visit this place, try a few different dishes and share your opinion here on Yelp.  This is not my first choice of a place to get Italian food here in Vegas,  but if you like a chain and are familiar with the food and you like it, GO, GO, GO and enjoy...its not a BAD place by any means, just not up to my liking to say it is a favorite of mine.",

Everything we had was very good to great, the mussels are outstanding, and the prices are not all that high, especially by Vegas standards. For a higher end Italian place you would pay the same prices in Edmonton and the service would be no where near as good.  Total bill was $270, before tip, for 5 people including two bottles of good wine, cocktails for three and three beer. Pretty standard in Vegas now to see \"Recommended Tip\" starts at 18% and goes to 20%. Well, they can kiss my butt, I don't care what they recommend. Typically I leave 10% for good service, 5% for mediocre and 0 for bad. Here we left 30%.",

For being a lighter entree it definitely didn't lack flavor, was filling and tasted delicious. My co worker went for the salmon sammie and also enjoyed the food. Heart the ambiance here and the old style Vegas feel especially with the Sinatra music.  Overall a splendid lunch with a great view. I definitely will be returning here again!",

Okay so I'm not the biggest pasta fan in the universe, and the calorie counts here are insanity. I figured 800-1700 calorie meals must equate to a restaurant that serves huge portions. After eating here, I guess not.  We waited outside because we had an 11 am reservation. 2 minutes to 11, staff, including back of house, were sitting at tables right in front of the doors, on their phones drinking stuff. Not a good look.  We entered through the mall entrance. Staff at the bar just looked at us but didn't point us to the podium in the center of the restaurant or acknowledge us.   We sat at a booth while a boisterous waiter told us about the specials. He talked up a bacon bruschetta ($13.95) and a spare rib dish ($19.95) - both of which we ordered. Brian ordered the steak ($17.95) as his entree.  Above us must have been some waiter stand because two male waiters were complaining to each other about who was scheduled for the night shift vs day and how it was unfair, blah, blah, blah. Take that ish to the back, not right where customers are forced to listen.  Bacon bruschetta was not that great. 5 pieces of crostini topped with a tablespoon of ricotta, a slice of bacon, a single arugala leaf and some balsamic drizzle. That comes out to... $2.79/piece pre tax. It wasn't that tasty and definitely did not deserve a waiter waxing poetic about it. Would not order even if it were $2.79 for all 5 pieces.   Pork spare rib dish was quite small and not filling. Amount did not justify the price. Polenta was fried like tater tots rather than creamy like I was hoping.  Brian's steak was ordered medium but was easily well to well done. He was visibly unhappy about his meal. Presentation was sloppy as his meat was swimming in sauce.   Despite an empty restaurant, a crochety, demanding couple was seated next to us. They needed lemons, they needed balsamic, they needed minced garlic, they needed the garlic to be fresh and then fried in the back, they needed the garlic crispier... This was before they even ordered and all this was just to eat the complimentary bread. Then they needed the specials read and then they couldn't decide so they needed verbal descriptions of a handful of the waiter's favorite dishes. It was all I could do to not make a comment to them.  Overall while the restaurant looks nice and our waiter did a fine job, the rest of the experience was lackluster and the food was disappointing and a poor value at $55 total. Would not recommend.",

He also made sure that there were no food allergy issues.   Now, the not so good. The food overall was way below what we were expecting for a restaurant that is considered semi-upscale and quite pricey. We first ordered the Calamari Fritte, Mozzarella Marinara, Stuffed Mushrooms and the Crispy Zucchini Fritte appetizers. The calamari was good but a little too heavy on the breading. The zucchini was also ok. Both were served with dipping sauces that were disappointing. The mozzarella was served as large squares but came out warm, not hot, so the cheese was not runny as we like it. Again, the dipping sauce (in this case a tomato marinara sauce was too heavy and bitter and definitely did not taste \"freshly made\". If it was, they need a new recipe. Finally, the stuffed mushrooms were good, but not great.   Portion sizes were large - no complaints there.  As for the main courses, the veal parmigiana was only ok, not great. The texture of the veal was not consistent from piece to piece. And again, I will bring up the tomato sauce that came with it. It was very bitter, almost like it was overcooked, and tasted too much like a sauce you get out of a jar. The pasta was very well done and was the best part of that dish. The Linguine di Mare was disappointing as the clams were way overcooked and \"meely\" textured. The steak and ravioli special was good, although the ravioli was a little sparse on the seafood stuffing. However, the steak was well cooked. The chicken parmisan was good although it had the same sauce problem as the veal.  I know restaurant reviews are very subjective as everyone's taste is different. To me, it comes down to this. Would I go back for another meal? Taking into account the food quality, the price and considering how many other Italian restaurants there are in Vegas, my answer, in this case, is no.",

In total, I visited Maggiano's at least 10 times, and was never disappointed by their food, or their service. The waiters have an eye for detail and do everything they can to make you happy! The one waiter who really stood out so far was Hector - he should really get a raise :)  Looking forward to next time!",

    "text": "We were planning on eating someplace different until our car decided not to work.    It was fortunate that we were staying at Encore and decided to walk across the street to the Fashion Show Mall.  We tried to eat at Grimaldi's and we walked all the way over there only to find out that it's only pizza now.  We walked around and found Maggiano's by the entrance we entered when first got to the mall.  We looked at the menu and figured it looked good.  We went to the reception desk and were told it was an hour wait.  I asked about the bar area and was told it was all open seating as long as everyone in the party was 21+.  We walked back to the bar and found a high table to sit.  After 10 minutes, we were greeted by the smiley Nicole.  She said she would be our server and took our drink order.  She brought our drinks back, then disappeared for 20 minutes.  We wondered what happened to her since she seemed like a good server.  Well, Nicole stopped by and asked if the other server had been by to help us.  We said no, so she apologized profusely and said she would take care of us.  Thank goodness she did.  Nicole is a very good server, attentive, and responsive.  (There was a miscommunication between her and another server as Nicole was going to hand us off to the other server).  After the mix-up was cleared up, Nicole gave us top-notch service the rest of the evening.  I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and replaced the spaghetti with rigatoni.  It was a very good dish and I almost finished the whole thing.  My friend enjoyed her linguine with clams in white wine sauce.  Overall, a very good experience at Maggiano's.  Xie Xie!",

    "text": "Meh. Went there for Memorial Day for party of 14 friends & family. First and last time here ever. Half of us arrived @1pm to make reservations & was told by host it would be about 30 min via text notification. Sure. Np. We waited next to the bar area while waiting for the rest of our party who all arrived @1:30 pm. The restaurant didn't look full there's was a few spots available throughout especially on the mall patio side & the bar had 2 patrons.  We finally got seated @2:50pm lol they kept telling us they were just waiting for the current party to leave so they can group a few tables together. The mngr could've at least gave us some bread rolls n water while we waited right? Nope. He's nowhere to be found. I had to flag down a random server for that. They made all 14 of us wait for almost 90min just to \"bunch a few tables\" together. I asked if we could all seat outside at the mall area patio since no one was there I was told by the blonde host that it wasn't open, really? on Memorial Day for party of 14 it ain't available? For reals?  They finally sat all 14 of us at this \"combined table\" that looked like it was meant for 10 people it was so uncomfortable. Our server had this condescending tone from her the entire time. The food was ok. I had the surf & turf which for $49 u only get 8oz fillet mignon & 8oz lobster tail & side of clarified butter & lemon, it was meh, that's all u get it could've used a side salad & roasted potatoes vegetables or something I could've gone to Bellagio for that price & had unlimited king crab legs lol. If u plan on coming here make sure yaal make ur reservations way ahead in advance to avoid this kind of mess yikes! Bad experience overall  never again.",

To be honest, all the maggiano's are about the same...which is a good thing because I really like their food!  We had their banquet style menu and the appetizers were great--fried calamari, salad, and stuffed mushrooms (THE BEST) to kick it off...  All the entrees were spot on...including the salmon (cooked perfectly, which is hard to do w fish in the large quantities they gave us) and the chicken marsala.  The desserts were heaven--the giant chocolate mountain cake (at least thats what I call it cause it looks like half dome at Yosemite) was sweet enough to make you instantly diabetic, and the tiramisu was the perfect texture of...well...tiramisu.  Throw in sangria to add a kick to the night, and we are talking one very good meal with great friends!  Happy Eating!",

We had a salad and soup and some other dish and everything was great.  The staff waited on us hand and foot and we had the most adorable waiter too!  What a nice surprise to find in the Fashion Mall.  I will be back here the next time that I'm in Vegas.  Why spend tons of money in the hotels when this place is far better!!!",

Veal parm needed to pounded out it was way to thick for veal, chicken Marsala I was told was good but not enough chicken was given for everyone to try, some pasta dish came out but still not sure what it was maybe it had some meatball or sausage in it but it wasn't a red sauce n it was very bland. stuffed mushrooms were stuffed with only bread crumb which was ok I guess. Chef gave us a really nice bruschetta platter which was great n our Apple n brownies were great as well. I am disappointed in the fact that we were unable to order separate dinners, we are not big fans of eating off of plates that others have their hands in and being that it's cold n flu season it was just not a good idea. I manage to get my husband dinner served from the kitchen but the waiter seem annoyed n recommended that I just scoop his first. Well I refused n insisted he get his from the kitchen. Anyway it all worked out. We enjoyed the rest of the evening but will never do a pre fixed meal again.",

I had last my voice the previous weekend so the bartenders were having a good time with me while I waited for my friends. They are very friendly guys and very attentive.

For food I ordered the bruschetta and crab cakes, soooo yummy! I think I could continually eat the crab cakes. Just keep them coming! Overall, my experience here is always great.

Went here with 12 people and had wonderful time despite the mediocre food.  Like all chains, the menu is formulaic and there are hits and misses.    Hits include the super garlicy Shrimp Oreganata, Garlic Shrimp Linguine, and Lobster Ravioli.  Needless to say, they do garlic right.  The tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous (not that this matters much since Maggiano's is all you can eat)  Misses included a mediocre (actually pretty bad) gnocchi, oily and limp Eggplant Parmesan, and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless.  I last went t this Maggiano's back in 2005 and can't say I'd recommend it for 'fine dining,' but in terms of bang-for-your-buck in Las Vegas it is certainly a valid option.  2 Stars for the food, 4 for a good time atomsphere with a big group.  Its closer to a 2.5 than a 3, but I'll round up for good memories.",

Thinking about the dish makes my mouth water. Since I didn't know what to choose for the main course, I asked the waiter for advice and he was insightful. The garlic shrimp pasta turned out to be delicious, especially the savory shrimps! Also, the lobster dishes (ravioli and carbonara) which my friend and boyfriend ordered were cooked perfectly.  In terms of Italian food, I give Maggiano's a 5! This is no ordinary Italian food you get any day.  Great food, classy atmosphere, reasonable prices, and generous portions! What's not to love??? Definitely going back next time I'm in Vegas! AND making reservations to avoid the wait.",

You can choose between 3 different price groups, all that come with different options, which are all reasonable and well worth the money.   I'm absolutely gaga (No lady, stay out of this one) over their Chicken Francese and their mash potatoes. To DIE! Their Chicken Francese is not traditional, however. It is breaded and then smothered in lemon sauce. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Did I mention they don't stop bringing more food until you tell them too? GO HUNGRY!",

The only thing I enjoyed was the Famous Rigatoni, very flavorful and delicious.  The baked ziti pasta was very bland and tasteless.  The surf and turf was a mistake for a pasta place.",

If I knew they weren't reserved, we would've sat there for sure!) All their window/patio seats outside were taken. We wanted the air conditioning, so it didn't bother us at all. If you choose to get a nice table for 2 outside reserve it or come early!  Chris was our server, and he was great, friendly, and genuinely interested in providing a fantastic guest experience. After ordering our appetizer, we were served their homemade bread (I think!) which was excellent, we then ordered stuffed mushroom caps, (DELICIOUS, and FILLING!) We placed an order for Baked Eggplant, and Rigatoni D' for entrees. The portions were ridiculously large and delicious. We also had 2 glasses of  White Zinfandel, which were during happy hour, and received %10 off our dinner after mentioning a coupon we had. The dinner came to $70.00, tip, taxes included, but it was a special treat for us, and we didn't mind as the service and food was excellent.  Would strongly recommend this restaurant if you have no plans and you're in the area.",

    "text": "Breaking News: Notorious Italian cuisine hater, Archie G., had Italian food for dinner and didn't immediately want to vomit afterwards.  On a business trip in Las Vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak Spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our Latin American distributors (who don't speak English) for dinner. Somehow, I was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. Normally, I shy away from huge responsibility at work. I avoid the break room so I don't have to ever have to take out the trash. That's just how lazy I am.  Anyway, with this language challenged arrangement, I knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of Spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. Luckily for me, Maggiano's helped out with the experience.  The two Chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and Italian food. With the help of my Yelp Blackberry application, I suggested Benihana or Maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). Ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard Maggiano's and the date was set.  For starters, the staff here is a superb. The hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so I was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as I ran off and went shopping for a little gift for La Novia at the nearby mall. Our server was awesome. How lucky was I that the server was Chilean? He helped out immensely making our Chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. Great guy. Great server. Give that guy a raise.  As for the food, it wasn't terrible. We had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.  Appetizers: We had the \"Calamari Fritte\" and \"Stuffed Mushrooms.\" The fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially Ragu. I liked the stuffed mushrooms and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. However, I did wonder why they were not given an Italian name on the menu. Maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of Italian in college?  Salads: The \"Chopped Salad\" was a eally good salad. There is no way it can be good for you.  We also had the \"Italian Tossed Salad\" and it was wonderful. Who doesn't love a good tossed salad by an Italian?  Main courses: We ordered 4 different main courses. The \"Spaghetti, Meatball\" and I could have made it better at home. The \"Veal Ravioli\" was pretty good. It wasn't as heavy as I had imagined. The \"Gnocchi, Tomato Vodka Sauce\" was my contribution to the group. The gnocchi just melted in your mouth. It was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. The \"The \"Salmon, Lemon & Herb\" smelled pretty bad. I was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. I didn't want La Novia to pick me up from the airport and think I was having an affair or something.  Desserts: The Creme Brulee was pretty good. We had three rounds of this. I love burnt cream. We had the \"N.Y. Style Cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. I think the \"N.Y.\" stood for \"Not Your.\" As in, \"Not Your Style Cheesecake.\"  Overall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. It was factory style Italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. Essentially, it was a pricier version of \"Olive Garbage\" or \"Bucket of Crappo.\"  This was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. But the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. So successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general Las Vegas debauchery.  And well, I will award another star for that.",

The BF and I were on a quest, and we came across the menu that graciously advertised gluten-free pasta, so in we went.  The server was a SUPER HAPPY fella, who brought the chef over to customize my meal basically however I wanted!  I ended up with some baked corn pasta with chicken, marinara sauce and cheese - DELICIOUS!!   It's classy inside, but the lunch prices were totally fine (for Vegas standards, that is), plus the portions were huge.  The waiter kept our water coming and even gave the BF two glasses at a time ;)",

The sauce had a great flavor and texture. We both had a side Cesar salad that was also amazing! The dressing was so delicious! Our waiter kept our bread basket full(so yummy) and the olive oil dipping sauce was also delicious.   We really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere of the restaurant!",

Maggianos is beautifully located  within Fashion Show Mall on the Strip, so just with that alone you know the views are amazing, directly facing the Wynn hotels light show and tons of people watching. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and open arms, we were immediately shown to are seats. Next came are server he was great and I am sad I can't remember his name but if it's anything to anyone he did his job great and made sure I had the wine list right in front of me, so three glasses of Riesling later, I am unsure of his name. My husband and I started our meals off with  the bruschetta bar appetizers. Here were the offerings we had two of everything.   Candied Nueske Bacon, Ricotta, Arugula & Fig Jam2.95Per PieceTomato, Balsamic & Garlic1.95Per PieceSpiced Shrimp, Bacon, Roasted Peppers & Corn Fondue2.95Per PieceRoasted Pear, Prosciutto, Blue Cheese & Balsamic1.95Per Piece Strawberry Chutney, Orange Fondue & Prosciutto 1.95Per Piece  Then for our main course he had the  Angel Hair Vegetable Primavera, My husbands plate came out large and bold full of flavor he really enjoyed the purple cauliflower that came with the meal. Cauliflower, Zucchini, Squash, Carrots, Marinara, Cheese Blend, with Garlic Butter13.95 For my main course I ordered  Four-Cheese RavioliPesto Alfredo Sauce15.95  My plate came out piping hot!! I was a little nervous about the color of my meal but then did a quick sniff test and realized that it's the Pesto duh!!! And I loved the fact that my pasta was not only boiled but oven baked as well to create that amazing top of cheese burn...  it was great. This place is really a nice place for a beautiful dinner really happy I had the opportunity to enjoy.  As you can see the prices are great so don't pass this place up it won't kill your pocket book.   Hint: Ask for fresh shaved parm, they have it in the back",

The staff was very nice and accommodating of our requests for substitutions and split checks, and we even left the restaurant with to-go boxes, which is always a plus for Vegas, when late-night pasta cravings hit after a night out. I managed to polish off my lemon butter salmon and side of vegetables (both delicious) and they include fresh bread at the table that's great for sopping up sauce on the plate- exactly what i expect of an Italian restaurant! I would definitely recommend Maggiano's if you're looking for food for a large group in Vegas that doesn't break your wallet.",

    "text": "This restaurant is huge and located directly on the strip. Very nice cozy feel inside with windows all around offering a great view. Service was quick pleasant and on top of things , even with it being such a busy night at dinner time. The prices are very good as the portions are quite big. They offer bread and complimentary bruschetta. We ordered family style which for the price came with so much food (chop salad with was fresh and tasty with crispy prosciutto and blue cheese but not too overpowering, we also had the fried calamari also fresh and not too oily, we had the lemon and herb salmon which was very tasty and well cooked, four cheese ravioli which was rich but good, eggplant Parmesan which was also rich but tasted nice they put lots of cheese! But maybe a little too much sauce. The chicken Parmesan was my least favourite it wasn't bad just way too oily. For dessert we had tiramisu and cheesecake and both were delicious , light and delicious without being too sweet. Overall this was a good experience, great place for a group or for a dinner that work break the bank.",

Over all it comes out to about the same price as if you ordered the family style. Despite some of the dishes we ordered wasn't offered on the family style menu like braised beef contadina which tasted like pot roast with sausage. There were lots of meat for those who like meat,salmon Oscar was good but it was too salty and again there's no pasta as a side kick to help with the saltiness only comes with small amount of spinach and asparagus .The steak /potatoes fries wasn't soft and nothing to write home about . I would recommend stick to the basic like lasagne, chicken/veal Marsala instead going for their exotic dishes and opt for the family style of 30 something per person since at least you can choose two different desserts to end the meal and plenty of food to take home for your next day meal",

    "text": "I had organized a large group that met for a week long conference in Las Vegas and Maggiano's was amazing when it came to being very accommodating. We started with a party of 12 which became 13. I was able to update it on the phone with no issue. Being a large group, we had to order Family Style and choose our menu items prior to the meal. I had one person gluten-free (celiac), one low-carb, and two that could not eat mushrooms. To say choosing items was a challenge would be True, however, the crew at Maggiano's didn't even bat an eyelash at this! The chef that evening came out to verify our menu and speak with our friend that required gluten-free. The chef was able to make side plates of what was ordered just for him so it was safe. He even mentioned that the fried prosciutto that came on the Chopped Salad would not be safe for him because it's prepared near gluten products, so he would prepare a separate bowl anyway for him - something we didn't know about even though I had verified the dish did not come with any gluten-based items. The meal was delicious and very filling. I took back to my hotel room the remains of the braised beef contadina - beautiful slow cooked beef that fell apart in your mouth. I was worried folks would want more, but we had a few platters with food left on them. Wine selection was excellent and I had an after dinner espresso that reminded me of my first in Italy years ago. The tiramisu was delicious and I wished I had the platter of it all to myself.  The space is beautiful and even more so since they had decorated for Christmas. There were other large groups so it was a bit loud and made conversations a bit difficult. I would definitely return here with a smaller group to be able to enjoy the cozy ambiance better. Overall, I loved dining at Maggiano's and would return. I wish there was one in Portland, OR!",

    "text": "We were looking for a good, but not exorbitantly priced Italian dinner on the strip after the Cirque du Soleil show at Treasure Island and Maggiano's (open until 11) did not disappoint.  The food was excellent, the quantities generous, the atmosphere upscale but not formal, and the service both courteous and efficient.  The three of us were uniformly pleased with our respective selections: chicken, spinach and ricotta stuffed manicotti for me, eggplant parmesan with gluten free pasta for Norm, and I believe \"traditional home-style lasagna for Dennis, a favorite of the Philly native.   Our meals were preceded by warm, soft and delicious house-baked bread accompanied with olive oil, which we determined not to over indulge in in anticipation of the main dishes of reportedly large portions, which again, did not disappoint in either quality or quantity.   My manicotti rested in on a pool of delicious and thankfully not nauseatingly rich Asiago cream sauce, a 4-Lactaid event of potential dairy disaster, especially as it was determined early on there would be no leftovers, but all settled just fine and I don't regret one rich delicious bite or spooning up the remaining Asiago sauce after the entree was gone.  My meal came in at a very reasonable (especially for  the Strip) $18.50 plus $6.50 spinach side salad with pine nuts, a not-overpowering smattering of red onion, applewood smoked bacon, a white balsamic vinaigrette, and blue cheese,  I loathe bleu cheese but had mistaken it on sight for feta, and the salad did not suffer for its removal. Regrettably there was no room for dessert.   Service was polite, efficient, and more than reasonably attentive.  My iced tea and water glasses never stayed low for long.  Our total for 3, including wine, beer, and my tea and side salad came in at I believe under $100, which we agreed was very reasonable given the location, quality, quantity, service, atmosphere and ambiance.    We were surprised to learn this restaurant is part of a modest sized chain of Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants, and grateful to find out they have one comparatively near us in Phoenix, over in Scottsdale.  Given distances (and our budgets!), Maggiano's won't be a regular dining destination for us, but it will be a special one.  If all locations are as good as this one, we collectively highly recommend.",

This particular location is awesome too, and I suspect because of it's primo Las Vegas Strip location, they are all trained to wow you with their service.  I took the wife and kid here, and I was almost ashamed to do so because of the white cloth tables. This location seemed just a tad upper class, but alas we were hungry wolfpack. And I spotted a smattering of kids here so I didn't feel as bad later.  Ordered the bruschetta, shrimp scampi, and classic spaghetti meatballs. All dishes were excellent,  esp the scampi. No complaints here. The bruschetta was super tasty, the tomatoes and olive oil made me feel like I was in Tuscany. Haha. Too much? Yeah.  Service was amazing. I didn't get the guys name but it was perfect. Friendly, but not fake, attentive, but not pyscho. Deserving of his 25% tip...only in Vegas right?  Anyway, if you got an urge for Italian but don't want snotty service at a Michelen joint, come here.",

    "text": "We reserved a table for 7 on a Friday night for my 40th birthday weekend at Maggiano's, where my parents had previously been and had raved about. I had never been here but took their word that it would be great. Unfortunately, we were all extremely disappointed.   Upon entering, we were all shocked at how warm it was in the restaurant, even with it being 100+ outside, it felt muggy and warm. We were promptly seated but that's where the good news ends.   Our waiter was Billy and he was cheerful and happy to hear we were celebrating my birthday. He took our drink orders and disappeared. This was a common theme during the night. There were times we didn't see him for over 20-30 minutes. Busboys as well, at one point I had an empty water glass for 25 minutes, and as hot as it was in there, I was miserable.   Ok, so a review of the food. We opted for the family style dinner for the 7 of us. I asked specifically if they made my favorite meal, penne ala vodka, where the pasta is extra \"al dente\", almost crunchy. Billy said absolutly, all their pasta is made like that. Awesome. We also ordered ceasar salad, tomato & mozzarella salad, fried calamari, balsamic glazed salmon, pasta with clam sauce and veal parmagian.   On the plus side, the portions were plentiful. But once any plates were dropped at the table, we never saw a waiter or a server again.  The appetizers and salads were great. After our appetizers were finished, the busboy asked if we would like more drinks. My brother ordered another pitcher of sangria for the girls. This is important. Remember when we ordered this. But the pastas were horrendous. Mushy and way overcooked. I was so upset since I asked specifically about this. And our waiter was no where to be seen. Finally, 25 minutes after our food was dropped off, our waiter surfaces after we flagged him down. I had also had an empty water glass for about 20 minutes at this point along with 4 others. I tell him what's wrong and he argues with me about it. I just start laughing at this point and tell him to forget it. He says the kitchen can remake it and I say what's the use? Dinner is over! Remember that pitcher of sangria we ordered? Yeah, it finally shows up now. None of us really want it now. Oh, and we had to order dessert. They forgot it was my birthday.   Now here's the kicker. 4 of us end up getting sick that night. Turns out it was the 4 of us that had the balsamic glazed salmon. So my mom calls the restaurant to tell them and to complain about the general bad service we had. They do their due diligence, have the chef call her and tell her they are going to send her \"something special\" in the mail. That was SEVENTEEN DAYS AGO. She hasn't received anything from them. We spent almost $500 on dinner. What a waste for poor service and a lackluster dinner.   Pros: portion size  Cons: Service, restaurant temperature, food quality, management follow through  All in all, I won't be back and neither will the 6 other people in my party.",

    "text": "Definitely a 4 star dinner..  unless you are one of those experienced in Italian cuisine then you may have a more advanced opinion on the taste of the food.  To me, the food was good.   Not great and doesn't make me rushing to come back for more, but good to the point that I had a lovely dinner with my family. Stuffed mushrooms for appetizer were good.  Fresh and evenly flavored but nothing I can't easily make at home. (first plate came out and my husband took a bite only to get a long blonde hair in his mouth.. we notified our waitress who immediately apologized and took the plate to the manager, which came over to apologize and offer a new appetizer whether the same or a different one, and comped the appetizer for the troubles.) My son had the kids Mac n cheese, one of the best Mac n cheeses we have tasted off of a kids menu. My daughter had a Caesar salad add shrimp:  fresh and like a Caesar should taste.. I did not try her shrimp because she ate them so fast so they must've been good. I ordered the lobster carbonara add Oscar style (crab meat and asparagus).  (((Next day update:: I just finished my leftovers and I can actually judge this dish.  I think it was good, but could've been better based on the ingredients alone.   The sun dried tomatoes would've been better in smaller pieces, and there weren't enough snap peas.. a few more would've given it that different texture that this dish lacks.  Maybe add a slice of or recommend garlic bread to soak up some of that cheesy sauce.)))  My husband ordered the rigatoni d, that was quite delicious! We also had the chocolate cake a la mode for dessert.  I should've taken our waitress suggestion and tried the Italian cream cake.. the chocolate one was good but it was just that, a good slice of chocolate overload cake (and this is coming from a chocolate lover.).   Why we will go back:  ambience/atmosphere, good service, big selection.",

So last couple of weeks, after we had a long and tiring day, me and my husband decided to go to Maggiano's for a happy hour. It took like 15mins for our bartender CARLOS to give us water and the menu, which we understand cos he is busy, but when another couple who was dressed formally and looked really rich sat beside us, he immediately greeted them and took their order and served them, while we were still waiting for him to get our order. I hope Carlos will never judge a person by the looks and nationality. My husband is also a server so he knows how hard the job is, so he always give a generous amount of tip, if not, almost half of the bill!",

Amazing salads and pasta...and the desserts, to die!! If you haven't been,  what are you waiting for?",

We are always courteous and thankful to the wait staff but if the customer wants to talk to you that is one thing but to just join in like you are having dinner with us. Really???",

The staff was friendly, service was great, prices were reasonable. Been here twice now and everything was spectacular. This is a must try when in town. There is a good relaxed atmosphere when inside and a nice escape from the business of the strip...even though it is on the strip. Very nice place to visit if you want to have a good, Vegas restaurant  experience. The Vegas thing is True, I tipped my waiter $20 bucks at the beginning of the meal and he came very frequently to the table. Drinks, bread, anything we asked for came very quickly. I gave him a good tip at the end of the meal cause he ran his tail off to make our meal the best we have experienced there yet. Cheers!",

Turns out last time he accidentally got the \"lighter fare\" option, which is why it was so small. The regular portion is a good size. The linguine di mare is still twice the size though!  Delicious Italian food in the Fashion Show Mall on the strip. Nice setting and great service. A word of warning: the portion sizes are drastically different between entrees. Check with your server what size the entree you want is, I ended up with a massive portion and my husband's dish was tiny.   Linguini di mare is delicious, huge, and FULL of seafood! Shrimp fra diavolo is good but small.",

    "text": "There's a Maggiano's in my hometown of San Jose. Strangely enough, I have never been to that place. So this was my first time ever at Maggiano's! Whoa.  We pretty much hit the jackpot with parking. The underground lot of the Fashion Show mall has several entrances, and although we entered from the south end of the mall, we found our way to the northeast corner (which was actually near an exit) and found a perfect, surprisingly non-wheelchair parking space very close to the elevator that takes you directly to the back of Maggiano's.  After walking through to the host desk at the front, we got seated fairly quickly. It was a busy lunch hour, but not absolutely jampacked. We were seated by a window, thankfully, and we got to see some of the Wynn and Palazzo. I had a blast watching the Wynn divider move up and down the LED screen. Who needs a TV?  I somewhat surprised myself for asking for coffee. I was dead tired from accumulate sleep debt this week, so it was worth every penny of the $2.95. Our server was funny though. He took care to turn the saucer such that the spoon and coffee mug handle were angled to my left, even though it's kinda assumed that most people (including yours truly) are right-handed.  I have a lot of love for the Baked Eggplant Parmesan. So does my mom. She ordered it (and saved the leftovers for a special someone) along with the stuffed mushroom appetizers. My aunt went with the Linguini and Clams with white clam sauce, and I had the Veal Parmesan.  Just like in most Italian restaurants, we got started off with complimentary bread with olive oil / vinegar dipping sauce. Nice crust on the outside and soft absorbent inside. What more do you want?  The mushrooms came out first of the orders, and they were delicious. Couldn't care less that basically bread crumbs and fungus (with spinach and garlic). According to my mom, the version she knows from San Jose uses a higher number of smaller mushrooms. I guess you gotta go big in Vegas though, and I didn't mind fork-and-knifing it. I thought that the parmesan cheese available table-side did enhance the flavor, which some might view as a shortcoming.  I sampled some linguini too. It's pretty good, although the clam-to-noodle ratio reminds me strongly of ramen, in a not-that-appealing way. I like to have more of a balance of protein and starch.  My veal was nicely pounded, breaded, and fried and was sufficiently tender as far as that goes. The melted provolone and marinara sauce and the accompanying spaghetti were all great complements. I just realized that I didn't dust off my leftover veal with parmesan before leaving, which makes me a bit sad.  Overall, it was good, solid Italian food. One of the best parts, really, was the view, which strongly correlates with the obvious Las Vegas Strip price markups. It's alright though - I would have been hard-pressed to spend the $50 in gift cards at another time. Yay for heavy reductions on out-of-pocket costs!",

    "text": "The noodles were saggy and broken. There was supposed to be mushrooms in the vegetarian pasta... none. The sauce was underwhelming. The noise level was intolerable. Our waitress, Kim was wonderful, even under the pressure of a full house. I wouldn't eat here during peak hours. Not worth the wait or your time. The prices were out of control, vegas style. Also, if you are going to be on the \"Strip\" you might just want to up your GAME as a player. Food is a big part of visiting Vegas and this was a sad state of affairs for a restaurant chain that  usually can be good in it's selection and options. I have to give KIM our waitress that night a two thumbs up. She went above and beyond and took my meal off my bill. Even though I didn't protest until we were done, nor did I ask her deduct the costs from my bill, she did it anyway. I returned the kind gesture by giving her the tip increase she deserved. Now, that's great service and she was considerate and understanding. I can't say the same for the Kitchen help that created such a mess of a dish. Time to replace them with a more competent team of cooks.   Sorry Maggiano's you get an F for really fucking up a vegetable dish. Don't go here on peak hours or vacation times, you will regret it.",

    "text": "We went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style.    The last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to 1-2 items per category.    So you get to chose 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas and 2 desserts for $23 per person (it use to be 2 for each I believe - my aunt was really disappointed).  They come out with the first plate and if you want more, you order 2nd or 3rd's according to how many people want extra.  (They do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).    They do have gluten-free penne pasta so I was able to eat that.    We ordered the caesar salad, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free baked ziti, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.  The salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy. The calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection. Everyone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better. The baked ziti had sausage in it and I usually love sausage but I didn't care for theres.   The tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  My nephew and I had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.  It was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  Our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more.",

I would probably go back just because I enjoy the location and the prices are decent.  The reason for the 2 stars is because of my experience in the bathroom. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate, and a female server walks in (tall, dirty blonde hair, Caucasian) and starts to make a phone call on speaker. She then proceeds to raise her voice in anger and use profanity (the F word specifically)  while speaking to whomever she was speaking to. I think she said \"you tell her when I get home I'm going to f&$!ing kill her...\" or something similar to that. Now... I also work in a restaurant on the strip, and if any of our employees were to do that, we would be fired for sure. Maybe she's lucky I didn't say anything to a manager or she might be fired too, I don't know if they would even care. That server made Maggiano's look bad in my eyes and I'm sure anyone else would've thought the same thing. Perhaps you shouldn't allow your staff to use the same bathroom as your guests, and all this could've been avoided.",

    "text": "Maggiano's is conveniently located in the Fashion Show mall below The Capital Grille.  It was my first time here and the food was better than I had expected.  I went with my beautiful girlfriend for lunch.  She had signed up for their mailing list and received a coupon good for $10.00 off our total meal.  The server was really nice and she even gave us her card at the end of the meal (after she had learned that we were locals).  We ordered Chicken Fetuccini Alfredo, Baked Ziti, and the Fried Zuchinni as an appetizer.  We were about to order more than the Fried Zuchinni for an appetizer, but I'm glad we didn't.  They turned out to be Zuchinni Spears (6) and they were huge! The breading on the Zuchinni was to die for!  It was cooked to perfection. I wonder if they used Panko to bread it?  I highly recommend it.  The Ziti was not that impressive at all.  It was way too meaty and sauce was bland in taste.  My Alfredo was good and rich in taste.  I had no complaints about the service (they even were able to give us a window seat when we asked...no reservation made).  We had a good view of the strip and Wynn casino.  I'd definitely come here again.  I would have scored them 5 star, but the Ziti knocked 'em down.  Next time, I want to try their Calamari!",

Their baked four cheese raviolis in creamy pesto sauce could not be more ah-mazing.Buyer beware, the half order is more than enough to fill you up! And another fair warning: the mama's lasagna could probably feed a family of five. Ok, if you have a huge appetite, maybe a family of three. 1star for the server. The SERVICE was great. We were seated quickly, the food came out quickly, had a great table with a view of the outside of Fashion Show Mall. But our server really...screwed up? He asked us where we were from and we responded \"California\" and he proceeded to tell us what bad drivers we are...umm does he know we are the ones who tip him? Regardless us this gentleman's faux pas I still tipped him 20%. Hopefully he'll learn to keep his big mouth shut next time he gets one of us crazy Californian drivers.",

It looked even better than I had imagined it would. There was SO MUCH food and it was all delicious! My guests all loved the food and some said it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding. This venue is a one stop shop, they referred me to a great DJ, bakery, florist, and limo service too! Thank you so much to everyone at Maggiano's!",

The great thing is the quality of food and service makes you not miss the pricey hotel restaurants.  On my most recent trip, my wife and I made reservations early afternoon for that night.  Our past couple of visits without reservations we had to wait for a table once we got to the restaurant.  This time we were seated right away.  The restaurant was busy for a Tuesday night, but not as busy as we had seen it before.  My wife got the Chicken Parmesan, which is a classic and delicious. I got the mushroom ravioli, which were also quite delicious.  The service was exceptional.  Our food arrived quickly and our waiter was friendly and helpful.  For me, this place is a must on every trip to Vegas.",

Oh wait, this song WAS played during our meal on 3.20.09.  I'm sure it loops every day though.  Decor:  3.5 Stars  Fancier than Macaroni Grill and I should hope so as this is Vegas and a step above its sister restaurant.  The seating was vast and it could probably fit at least 5 bachelorette parties.  Oh yeaaahh...  bachelorette parties...   *droool*  There weren't too many people let alone bachelorette parties, but most patrons were enjoying the beautiful weather in their outdoor seating area.  Food:  3 Stars  The minestrone was ok.  It was a bit cheesy and the color seemed paler (not as tomato-red) and its taste was different than most minestrone soups I've had.    I had the Lobster Fettuccine.  There wasn't much lobster.  Italian Sausages were also few and a bit burnt.  The peas and artichokes gave it a nice balance.  The white wine cream sauce was really good but a little salty than I like my pasta sauces to be.  So this Little Italy Favorite is a mainstay in San Francisco fare?  I'm glad I had the chance to savor it in Vegas.  I'd come back.  I'd probably go someplace closer though, like Orange County and go all out Family Style.    P.S. - To the previous Yelpers, I agree that the food made me thirsty; however, this place isn't as salty as their cousin On The Border in Rancho Cucamonga.  P.P.S. - Update 3/26.  I just read an article in Yahoo Health today:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhealth.yahoo.com%2Fexperts%2Featthis%2F26542%2Famericas-unhealthiest-restaurants&s=6c2cb9a7acda16310e7b2e0ceedb05262830186069f55fc25b7781d7d50d51f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">health.yahoo.com/experts...</a>.  Chili's, On the Border, and Macaroni Grill - all owned by Maggiano's parent company, Brinker are on the hit list and the sodium count on their menu items aren't benefiting my pre-hypertension.",

Try not to over eat on the bread and salad though because the dish itself you need to save room for and also the desert!  The pasta list also gives you options for gluten free or wheat as well for those who prefer. They also have a great alcohol selection and assist you in helping find a wine that best fits your meal that night. Definitely a great spot to eat and you can park inside of fashion show mall so there is a ton of parking!",

The look of the place gives an impression of a much more expensive restaurant but I think the prices are very reasonable compared to some other local restaurants.

The private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip. The service during the reception was stellar. I told our bartender/server about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs. She knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away. I had an awesome chopped salad to start with that made the other non-gluten free people around me jealous. Then I enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta. Oh my God, it was out of this world. I need to go to the Maggiano's and Tampa ASAP to have this again. Finally for dessert, I had the creme brulee, again making everyone around me jealous. The meal was unbelievable!! Kudos to the staff and chef at Maggiano's for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom. I have not visited an Italian restaurant since I learned of my allergy but now I absolutely have to go back to Maggiano's.  If you are in Vegas, definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay.",

I wish they had one in San Diego, but the closest one to us is in Orange County at the South Coast Plaza. I ordered the four cheese ravioli which came with two sauces, basil pesto and marinara, evenly distributed over the dish. The amount of ravioli was bountiful. I was barely able to finish it and when I did I was really full. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs which she had no problem finishing.  We tried to eat here again before we left but it was too busy. I think there was an hour wait. And this was on a Sunday night. This is a good sign the restaurant is doing something right since there are plenty of choices at the mall.  The service was a bit slow but the waiter kept us informed on when our meals would be ready. No big deal, we were not in a rush. Even though I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, this one is worth a try.",

    "text": "i LOVE LOVE LOVE Maggiano's. I've been to three of their locations, and most recently the Las Vegas one again.  My bf and I arrived around 8 on a Saturday night, and thankfully only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. We took the first available, which was outside and I wouldn't recommend it. It's not Maggiano's fault, but there was an iPod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. Even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, I was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. That being said, I still had a great dinner!   I've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  We started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  The Maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! And for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and spinach manicotti. Words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous.   I somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. But I just absolutely love their cheesecake. I am NOT a big fan of cheesecake, but Maggiano's makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful!   So if you are in Vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food I highly recommend Maggianos!",

We ordered all parts of the 5 course family style holiday menu and half of what we ordered showed up. They ran out of food at an \"all you can eat\" meal. Instead of being upfront with us we got a dog and pony type of magic show \"disappearing food\". When I approached the manager he asked\" what do you want me to do about it?\" Are you kidding me? $35 per person and you do not have what we want? I am fairly certain I will never go back, that's coming from a Chicago guy who loves Italian food. Also their regular menu item portions have been cut in half and the price slashed a buck or two.

Extreme dis-portion of mussels, which is more than half of the seafood.  I like mussels so that's ok with me, others may not be so happy.  The noodles need to be cooked longer in the broth as the flavors are not completely absorbed.  For desert, ordered the tiramisu, very light and creamy, with a strong coffee accent.

The hubs and I swung by Vegas just to see what the type is all about.   My fave Maggiano location is South Coast in Newport. It clean, food is favorful, great texture, and well attentive and high class staff.  This Vegas location. We were highly disappointed. I ordered the frutti de mare. Fancy sh!t right? Man, my entree was salllttttyyyyy. My blood pressure and sodium level just increased - nurse dilute me! My husband got the lasagna and we shared he appetizer of calamari. It tasted reheated or microwaved.   Our drinks were the best of the night - a coke and a glass of wine. Prepared directly by the company. No chefs needed.   $70 was our tab and I shake my head to this restaurant and wanted to slap the chef silly. We should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream Italian restaurant - Buca di Bepo instead!!",

I come here about at least twice a month and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and their delicious food. Make sure you try their Caesar's salad because they honestly have the BEST Caesar's salad. Everything else I've had on their menu has been phenomenal.   At Maggiano's you're able to substitute or subtract/add items you don't like. They also serve bread so an appetizer isn't needed unless you want to order them.   On weekends, it's probably best if you make a reservation just in case cause they can make you wait 25-35 mins for just 2 people, but they do accept walk-ins as well if you're up for the wait or just in the area.   Average bill for 2 ppl with 2 orders of side Caesar's salad and 2 beverages, excluding alcohol...is roughly $40. That price for good food, fancy looking restaurant and is on the strip is hard to find!",

    "text": "Quick Tip: Great Italian food :) has a small banquet room in the back, too.  A friend of mine recently got married and had his reception here. We came in through the back of the restaurant and I was amazed at how beautiful it looked. The hallways were decorated with vintage looking furniture, and the reception hall itself was beautiful. It had a big windown that you can see part of the Las Vegas strip from. Lots of light.  The dinner was sit-down buffet style. We had three courses: Appetizer, Main course and dessert. The food was awesome, most especially because there was only one dish with tomatoes! This was a special Italian restaurant and I was so happy to be able to try all their food.  The salad was excellent: fresh lettuce, blue cheese and dressing. There were two types, but I didn't get to taste the other one. The calamari was really good, too.  The cheese ravioli was a big hit at our table. Something so simple was so delicious, and felt so light in your mouth. There was chicken florentine, a steak with mushroom and then eggplant parmesian. I heard that this one was the best dish out of the main course, but i couldn't sample it. Guess why? :P  The dessert was cheesecake with strawberries, as well as a fruit plate with pineapples, honeydew, cantaloupes, grapes, strawberries, watermelons. Fresh. everything just tasted so fresh.  The best part of this dinner was that we found out that this reception place was a restaurant towards the front entrance. There is a full bar, and it looked like really efficient servers. They were all polite, too.   This is a place to definitely check out if you aren't interested in buffets, or just want to sample a different type of life with Vegas. Definitely a great atmosphere, with great food...and even better with great friends and family.",

The bruschetta is also worth mentioning; I guarantee you'll be asking for more bread to scoop up the abundance of tasty tomatoes. For dinner, I had the chicken marsala which was very good. My boyfriend got chicken franchise which (according to him) was decent. The potatoes and salad that his meal came with were excellent. Our waiter was very sweet. Everything, for me, was truly above average. I hope the Maggiano's in the tri-state are equally amazing.",

The place is wall to wall people. So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4. Our server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home.  The food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden. The one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip. it was one of the best I have ever had.  Save your money go elsewhere, where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation.  I for one will never go back.",

All of my guests were well fed and happy with the event, and commented all night on how great the service and food was.   The family style dinner isn't something anyone had seen at a wedding before, and we all thought that was great. We were a small group of 20, and we decided to have everyone seated at one long table, and that was perfect.

It was a short walk from our hotel and we wanted some REAL food after nights of bingeing on whatever we can get our hands on after the clubs. It is definitely on the expensive side where a half order of pasta will be around 11-17 bucks while a full order will cost you 20+.   They do encourage family style for tables of 4+, but i think the cheapest family style was still around 20 a person.   Out of the four of us we ordered: spaggetti with meatballs, lobster alfredo, fettucini alfredo and linguine with clams. All of the dishes were tasteless. I had to drown my linguine with claims with half the bottle of salt  and all my friends did too. Maybe the chef forgot about the salt??  Idk, although the pasta were tasteless, the seafood was fresh and the bread was pretty good too.   Meh, I've experienced better is the perfect description for this place.",

    "text": "I booked the reservations for party of 7 at 8.30 PM on Saturday (8/1). We were 2 families and one of the family was running late. One family party of 4 (2 Adults, 1 kid 7 yrs and 1 (2 yrs old)) arrived at 8.32 PM. They went to the host and asked for the reservation which was under his name (me). The hostess was reluctant to have them seated after requesting 2-3 times stating that they will make everyone seated once all the parties will arrive. What kind of customer service is this? Finally getting impatient as 2 yrs old was cranky i had raise my voice and asked for the manager. Then finally at 8.50 PM they got us seated - my friends family arrived 5 mins later. This in appropriate for a business like Maggiano's - the host should have been trained on the behavior on how to interact with the customer. I wouldn't recommend Maggiano's Las Vegas due to its poor customer service in dealing with people specially families with Kids. Thereafter the service was phenomenal - waitress were nice - Food was great too. But initial experience was pathetic.....",

After everyone was stuffed, we still had enough to feed another 5 people.  Comparably, the large plates are just a few bucks more than the small plates.. and average cost is about $15 per large order.    We had the linguine and clams in white sauce and the pesto chicken.  Both were very tasty!  I love pesto, so of course I went for the pesto first!    The setting is nice, dimmed and quiet.  This place is definitely the place to go to grab some dinner and head out to party afterwards.  It right on the strip by Wynn and Encore.",

It was a super long wait for 5pm but we got hooked up and passed the line. We were seated and everything was brought in a timely manner.

We were waited on by a young guy named Robert who attended to my friend and I wonderfully.  I haven't had service this courteous and prompt in years.  My friend had the \"San Francisco\" lobster linguine but replaced the linguine with wheat penne.  It was SO tasty!  I had the \"Chicago-style\" pasta.  It was bland and uneventful.  I even told our waiter but what can they do?  The bread we ate while we waited was fresh and tasty.    The real value to this place is the Italian dining-like experience on the strip without the large price tag.  I believe there were many lunch offerings for 12-15 dollars and there are a bunch of patio tables to take in the fresh air.  It was all but empty inside but this might be a classy dining experience for couples during the evening.",

The food was absolutely excellent and the vibe takes you away from the chaos of the strip for a bit. They gave us a large round table at the corner of the restaurant with a beautiful view and although the lighting was a bit dark (does that mean I'm getting old?), it provided a great ambiance for the meal.   There was definitely a huge wait for those that didn't have reservations (which appear to be an absolute must). The restrooms are clean and service was excellent. Only minor complaint is that there was a man walking around with a guitar that would play music for your table and wait around awkwardly until you tipped him. That was a little off putting but everyone needs to make a buck!   This location is at the Fashion Show Mall locates at the North end of the strip. We walked there from our hotel but I'm sure there's a parking structure in the back.",

    "text": "Food: this is my second time trying Maggiano's and I still am not that fond of the food here.  It isn't terrible but I end up feeling like one thing or another just isn't quite right.  For example, I ordered the calamari and it was lightly crispy but did not taste like fresh seafood.  Had a bit of a old seafood taste.  I am really all about a great base marinara sauce at Italian restaurants so I wanted to get the side of spaghetti marinara.  It looked good but the smell reminded me of canned sauce or bottle sauce you can get from the supermarket.  Once I tasted I still thought the same thing.  I also got the chicken francese which is like a chicken milanese with arugula and lightly breaded chicken in a white wine sauce.  I didn't understand why the chicken was so soggy it didn't feel like a crispy breast since they doused it in side and the arugula was also swimming in sauce.  It wasn't a good presentation and the taste wasn't so great either.  We got their limited time dessert to share which is Nonnas pound cake , it is served with chocolate shavings and caramelized banana.  I thought it was ok but I normally imagine a soft and slightly dense rich cake not a crunchy toasted cake.... it was almost a way to hide dry cake by just roasting it but can't go wrong with caramelized bananas   Service was great, she was very attentive and bright plenty of diet soda refills,  gave very genuine recommendations while making sure everything was ok.  I think I knew going in what to expect but was hoping for more.  Maybe the style here just doesn't match my taste buds   Overall the ambiance is great, very spacious and clean.  I might be leaning towards more of a family owned whole in the wall where the sauce is made by a real grandma who slow cooks the sauce for hours.",

    "text": "Our experience at Maggiano's wasn't bad, but it wasn't good; it was just kind of meh.   The biggest issue plaguing the evening was the incredibly loud dining room with no ambient music to help people regulate their volume. The second biggest issue was the stretched too thin service; it wasn't inattentive, but frantic and rushed.   The drinks were decent; but their happy hour is incredible! I will definitely stop in again for the half price (selected) drinks and cheap bar bites.   The food was unfortunately pretty hit or miss. For appetizers, Taylor and I tried their assortment of bruschetta; this was undoubtedly the best dish of the evening. The shrimp one was my favorite and also the most unique in my opinion. I have to say, I think the Italian Beef bite didn't have the Fontina cheese it was supposed to but it didn't phase Taylor. We also had a Caesar salad- average at best.   Taylor also really enjoyed his chicken meatball, mozzarella, sundried tomato, and pesto fettuccine. My entree wasn't as impressive. I ordered their \"famous rigatoni \"D\"\"; it was served in an undersized bowl, swimming in an ocean of bland, under reduced cream sauce with no Marsala flavor, the mushrooms were whole and undercooked, and the caramelized onions were cut to a small dice- not thin sliced like generally expected when an item features caramelized onion. The roasted chicken was the only redeeming part- tender and flavorful. I tried, but couldn't attempt to enjoy more than a couple bites.   Our server was understanding and brought back a menu to pick something else. We had a show less than an hour away, so I didn't want to order another full entree worried it would take too long and we would be rushing to the show. I enjoyed the bruschetta so I figured go with a sure thing at this point and asked about the house salad's base- \"is it mixed greens?\"   \"Yes\".  \"ok, I'll have that\". It was not mixed greens. Same romaine from the Caesar (and I assume the same on the chopped salad where it makes more sense). Despite expecting a different salad, the house dressing was really great and the crispy pancetta was even better.   Overall, I don't think I'll be joining them for a nice dinner and relaxed evening, but I'll give their happy hour a try and hope they can redeem themselves a bit.",

It was nice to eat here we sat at the table that we last dined at together. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so loving and somewhat something out of a 1950s movie. Even the music is correct for the period. We sat close to the window and  got to remember and celebrate a life that is watching over us now.  I love the larger portions here so I ordered a large Caesar salad and we ended up having left overs that it was so large. For the entree we spilt the Mamas lasagna. The lasagna here tasted like something that my mother would make too. It was not at all spicy or even left an after taste.   Sometimes we need dessert and today we did. Our server talked us into a creme brulee, which has strawberries in it. We also tried the marshmallow s'more. It is a s'more on steroids! The desserts were amazing. The s'more melts in your mouth and takes one back to those camping trips but making new ones. The Carmel that surrounds the s'more makes it indulgent.",

We were a party of 5 and 3 people arrived on time for the reservation while 2 people were running a bit late. I found it weird that the restaurant wasn't willing to even seat people until all the people turned up. They had several empty tables and there wasn't necessarily a rush out there. They mentioned that only when majority of the people come, can we be seated. And 3 people out of 5 isn't considered majority. I found the service a bit disappointing. We ordered Zucchini fritters which tasted great. They were a little greasy but I enjoyed the flavor of it. Mushroom ravioli was pretty good but the sauce seemed too heavy on the cheese/cream. I would have preferred something a little lighter but again it did taste good, just that the flavor gets monotonous after some bites.  The portion size are pretty generous but I have had better Italian food/service in other places. Bon appetit!",

It was some of the best best Italian food that I've had. Chicken was just right, very flavorful, marinara sauce was great, flatbread was surprisingly fantastic, overall great food.  Add to that the great service from our waiter, Steve, my wife loved the added attention, and although it was packed today, he came around frequently to check on us.  Finally, he topped it off with a celebratory champagne for both of us on our wedding day, just perfect and thoughtful. We will definitely be coming here again. Loved it!!!!!!",

We are locals and we know a thing or two about the restaurants here in town. This Maggiano's location is my favorite of the two.

From the very first email inquiry, to picking up our items the day after our wedding, working with the staff at Maggiano's LV was a True and honest blessing. Our wedding day was perfect for so many reasons... one of the top being, we chose this restaurant venue.   You would think planning an out of state reception by email correspondence would be hard? Nope. Not with Maggiano's LV. Beth and Jessie made our reception dreams come to life! They made the entire process easy and were always helpful- they were always focused on what we were envisioning. Out of every wedding vendor, they were always the quickest to respond.   We were able to off our decorations the night before but we also had the option of shipping our items to the venue at anytime. We had all three banquet rooms reserved.   When I walked into the reception, it was so hard to keep it together. It was even more beautiful than I could have imagined. They really went above and beyond with every detail. Not that you even need a lot of detail- the venue itself is gorgeous. You can't beat the view.   The food- everyone still talks about the food. Seriously- we will not go back to Vegas without eating at Maggiano's. Just a few highlights of what was served (you can't go wrong with anything)- chicken saltimbocca, pesto alfredo cheese raviolis, meatballs and asiago crusted shrimp. Okay...now my mouth is watering.   We set up our own iPhone for music- their audio system worked perfectly. There is plenty of dance floor space.   The service was incredible. Like I said, Beth and Jessie were absolutely incredible to work with- Myself, my husband and my in-laws (everyone who worked with them closely) were all treated like family. There was another staff member who passed around our small plate food items and he constantly made sure myself and the wedding party ate. I honestly would have gotten a chance to try our food if it wasn't for him. I wish I would have gotten his name because so many guests enjoyed his friendly presence as well.   I can't tell you enough how reassuring it was to know, all of our items would be kept safe until the next morning when we could pick them up. Not having to worry about that or having to ask a family member to stay back and do that was such a blessing.   I could go on and on about how smooth our wedding reception went, thanks to Maggiano's LV, but then it would turn into a book. I promise you, you will not regret holding any special event here. Thank you everyone at Maggiano's LV!",

Graduations. Anniversaries. Holidays. Maggiano's has always been a place where we feel that the staff is happy you're here and they want you to enjoy. I had the tenderloin risotto and hubby had linguine with clams. Both dishes were outstanding. There was none to bring home!! We finished with a complimentary dessert from the manager. Check out Maggiano's. You will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Good Italian food and great service really makes this location stand out!  Maggiano's is in the Fashion Show mall, and has a large restaurant and bar area (you can eat at the bar with a full menu).    The food is hot and fresh, and the servers are really on their game...they know what to recommend, they know what they like, and they really help you with your food and wine selections.  The service is really, really good!  They have a full Italian menu, plus steaks and seafood.  You can even order large dishes to share, aka \"Family Style\".  There is usually a Chef's selection or two on the menu, and last night I had the Chef's shells stuffed with Italian beef covered in a red sauce.  It was wonderful.  While the food is excellent, the wine list was just so-so.  There could be a few more wines by the glass on the wine list, in my opinion (Example, they had an average Pinot Noir by the glass on the menu...and no Oregon Pinot's by the glass).  The wine list might need a bit of a tune up.  The restaurant, although very large, fills up quickly...there was quite a wait on a Sunday night, and the bar was packed, so it is best to get a reputation.  The prices and quality of the food is very good, and the service is outstanding.",

Our waiter was friendly until we said we do not drink alcohol. He tried to push some fish special but I wanted the carbonara. Because I just love a good carbonara. It's my right ;) Well, this one was not good at all. There was lots of cream (cream in Carbonara??? which by the way was not described on the menu), the pieces of bacon were huge and greasy, the poached egg on the top was overcooked (as in the yolk was not runny).  My husband meatballs were not cooked through and his pasta dish overall was very heavy.  The waiter insisted that all was made from scratch but he delivered our dish so fast that I can't believe that.   Bottom line: Maggiano will never ever see us again.",

    "text": "First let me start by saying the start of our experience was pretty crappy for lack of a better word. We had a large group (17). We arrived but since we all drove seperately we clearly starting arriving at different times. Two of us arrived checked in and was told by the hostess we had to have more than half to be seated, fair enough. 5 minutes later I go back to the hostess and tell her 13 of us are there. She says ok it will just be a few minutes. 5 min later we check again and they say our table is being set up and water is being placed (which I don't see why water being placed would hinder us from sitting down but ok?!?!) so it will only be a min. 10 minutes later we go back again tell them our whole party is here and we are then told by a pretty snotty hostess that it will be a few minutes since we went from 17 to 14 people..I was so confused because we not once said we were down to 14 AND the reservation was made for 17 people, which is exactly what we had. Annoyed another person in the party went up to the hostess and a minute later we were being sat. No clue what he said to get us seated. Greeting and first impression 0 stars.  We were greeted by our servers as we were sitting down and they took our drink orders. Our servers were great, friendly and attentive. 5 stars!  Throughout the course of our meal we realized we were missing some plates. Mind you this meal was a preset meal ordered and planned online prior, of which we had confirmation. After asking our server about the missing dishes he said he was informed of something totally different. Irritated we just said never mind let's just get thru this dinner and leave. The manager came and spoke to our table and apologized for the error. She was sincere and after all was said and done everyone was content. The food was pretty good, comparable to other Italian restaurants. 3 stars.  Not sure I would go back but its location is nice, overseeing the Wynn and las vegas blvd at the fashion show mall. Location 4 stars.",

    "text": "Came here a few months ago with a party of 10 to celebrate my 10 year anniversary and I believe I hit the jackpot! I made reservations with the banquet manager who was very helpful, flexible and thorough with everything.  The day of the event was great except for the fact that the actual restaurant employees, such as the hostesses were not trained to tell people that my party was to meet in the rear of the restaurant. The reply was that there was no one there and they did not know of a party... this is really bad for business and some of my guest were kept waiting 20 minutes outside.  The dinner on the other hand was fabulous! I ordered the family style dinner and the food was fresh and tasted perfect. The waiter serving our event was a gem to work with and was so polite and professional, I loved it!  We had our own music playing on the Ipod dock that was provided by the restaurant as part of the contract. Our evening was made special because everyone did a fantastic job in communicating and getting all the details accurately of what was expected.  At the end of the meal a manager cashing out our check greeting me and was very polite and professional and made my day! The meal including 3 bottles of wine, desserts to feed an army + a tip came to a little over 1,000.00 and it was well worth it.  I highly recommend Maggiano's for any private event. They did a fantastic job with mines and I can't wait to come back!",

We noted that we were not celebrating anything, just having a date night. We had four people ask us if we were. It was starting to get annoying! I had the mushroom ravioli. It was extremely salty and I had a hard time trying to eat it. My husband had the steak with asparagus risotto. He asked for it medium rare and it came our almost well done. At this point we were running late for our show and just wanted to eat and leave since we were walking to the mirage. I doubt we will be returning to this location.

    "text": "You know the Lens Crafters slogan, \"Ready in about an hour\".  I was waiting at the mercy of the glasses gods, not really in the mood to shop, so I decided to talk a stroll to the other end of the mall for a glass of wine.  I considered each of the different restaurant options, but with the main goal in mind, wine, I opted for Maggiano's.    The rest of the mall was sparse, but you would never guess it was a Tuesday night upon entering.  The joint was hopping.  I found a vacant seat at the bar and grabbed their wine list.  I usually start with a white, but my mood was askew due to the onset of cool weather and early sunset.  After a brief study, I requested a glass of Meiomi Pinot Noir.  Score!!  Now, what to do with my hands while I sit here, but of course, an appetizer!  All of my friends can attest that I've been on a calamari quest of late.  Not surprising, I opt for the calamari.  While I'm kicking back sipping my savory cherry berry juice, the fellow next to me, a tourist from Connecticut, strikes up a lively conversation.  I discover he works for the Travel Channel, has an exact opposite wine palate from me, and we were both at the same event last Saturday (the Lee's 9th annual Wine Experience).  Perfecto!  Little golden rings cooked to lightly crunchy perfection arrive.  Pair them with Maggiano's famous marinara that suggests nuances of garlic, onion, and basil and I'm one happy camper who forgot she was waiting on anything.  The Lens Crafters notification call comes and goes, but I'm not ready to leave just yet, so I order up another glass of wine.  This time I order up a Cline Ancient Vines Zin, which isn't bad at all.",

We selected the mozzarella, calamari and Italian tossed salad, all three items were great and plentiful.  The fried mozzarella was my favorite one but the salad and dressing were just as good.  For entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes.  For dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  I'm not a chocolate person so I didn't try it but the cheesecake was Devine.  We actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake.  Portions are huge enough for 5-6 really.  The bread was also really yummy with balsamic and oil.  I think this will be a regular stop on future Vegas trips this was a great dining experience!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Maggianos because we are from Denver and love our restaurant there. It's a chain restaurant so should be exactly the same right?  Wrong.  I made a reservation two weeks earlier for 5:30 pm and asked for a table by the window if possible.  We arrived by 5pm and the hostess said she would come to the bar and get us when our table was ready. She said I can seat you now but I see you requested a window table. Ok fine. 55 min later we go back and ask what's up with our table?   The original hostess is gone now and the next girl says I don't see any reservation for you. She says that the other girl moved our name out of the waiting list as if we had been seated. Now we wait for another 15 min for a small table crammed into a corner where we can barely move.   At this point I'm really unhappy. But not as unhappy as I'm about to be with the food. We ordered mussels for appetizer which are in a spicy tomato sauce which was more like thin broth than sauce.  Yuck. Hubby ordered seafood pasta with the same runny sauce and I ordered the spinach and chicken manicotti which had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  Service was so so. Nothing great. Don't waste your money at this restaurant.   If you want a True Maggianos experience you'll have to go to Denver.   Will never come back here again!  I don't think it even deserves the 2 stars I gave it.",

    "text": "I've heard about Maggiano's for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when I was in Vegas for business.  Since there were 7 of us, we decided to order family style...  $31 a head and we choose two appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, and two desserts, all you can eat!  We ordered the calamari and mussels, chopped and Italian salad, spaghetti and meatballs and linguine with clams (white sauce) the chicken marsala and tilapia, and the tiramisu and s'mores special dessert.  Calamari was great, but I was a little disappointed in the mussels.  Too many white beans in the mix for me.  The salads were good.  Linguine was good and the meatballs on the spaghetti were HUGE! The tilapia wasn't too fishy and was nice and moist and we LOVED the chicken marsala.  Both desserts were great as well.  Big points for our waiter, Noel, as well.  He was very helpful, professional, and attentive through our stay.  He encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in.  The spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day, as well as the desserts!",

    "text": "It's a national chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. But, the good thing about higher-end chain restaurants is that they're consistent. And, in the case of Maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.  My wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included Chili's and Macaroni Grill. Naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- Maggiano's. Located in Fashion Show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. Walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the Strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.  This was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. They've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). For $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). My kid opted for the pizza. It's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. Tasty and large enough for two kids to share.  The lasagna was the best item of the night. A huge brick shape filled with crumbled meatballs and Italian sausage and covered in meat sauce. The gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. While it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy Italian sausage and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.  They have small dessert options for $2.95. The chocolate cake was decent. A little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. We also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.  While not the best Italian food in the city, Maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.  3.5 Stars",

I have ordered this as my main course and nibbled on my husbands food on a few occasions.  The portion size is HUGE.  We have done the Family Style meal and it was simply too much food.

Though Maggiano's is a chain, this location beats all of the other locations we have visited.  The waiter (Nester) was terrific.  We decided to do the Classic Family Style.  There was almost too much food for all of us.  Each course and entree was delicious.  Calamari was perfect.  Steamed mussels were awesome.  Caesar Salad was bountiful and a good palate cleanser before the entrees.  Peppercorn Beef, Salmon, Chicken Piccata, and Linguine with red clam sauce were all perfect together.  But remember you have two desserts coming so make some room.  On this particular evening they had a gentlemen playing the violin.  He came over and serenaded our father with Happy Birthday.  Bottom line Father loved it all. Thanks Maggiano's!",

    "text": "Maggiano's - Its Happy Hour is NO LONGER AS GOOD AS BEFORE (now 3Stars on my book), although still a great 4-Star restaurant for dinner.  YELPY DETAILS: - This nice mid-scale restaurant is conveniently located on the strip nearby the lively fashion mall district. It used to be my favorite spot for HH on the strip. It has an inviting bar area with a classy bar counter and several bar tables around, with a good selection of drinks and excellent service. But my wife and I just had an unsatifying HH experience there recently.  - One early Fri evening inmid-August, mywife and I came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that: (1) They NOT ONLY took away our favorite \"Fried Zucchinis\" from the Happy Hour Food Menu, (2) BUT ALSO, the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of ONLY ONE ITEM, i.e., Flatbread! Luckily the flatbread was delicious. - Well, my wife and I used to bring our out-of-town guests here for happy hour and dinner. The place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the PAST, especially during its happy hour. But, on this Fri evening (around 5:30pm),the bar area was PRACTICALLY EMPTY, with only 2 tables occupied and only ONE customer at the bar counter! We thought it could have a lot to do with the now VERY LIMITED HAPPY HOUR MENU, our nice and efficient waitress agreed. - Well, one more good point: We were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread FREE, which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oil/basamic vinegar!  BOTTOM LINE for HH: - Due to the diminished value and the \"Empty-Space-Atmosphere\" (on a Fri evening at that!), I'd now give it only 3 Stars for HH.  On the other hand, to be fair, just back in March, we brought friends over there for dinner (NOT HH), we did have a fabulous time, with tasty dishes, drinks and superb service! So, we wish that Maggiano Management would do something to bring back their popular HH menu and fill its place again for HH! - Hints: Please put back \"Fried Zucchinis\", and perhaps even add \"Crab Cakes\" to its Bar Menu, which is a GREAT HIT on Schottsdale Maggiano's HH Menu anyway! - Until then, I could still go there for a good dinner, but will not likely go back there just for happy hour.

    "text": "This is a review for the service.  I was there with a large party this past weekend. One of the members had specific eating needs, and a reservation was made well ahead of time so that the party could be split into 3 tables of 8 each in order to not do the family style eating. Again, the restaurant had agreed to this specific arrangement a number of months ahead of time.  Once we arrived, the restaurant did not honor this original agreement. We were told that it would have to be family style eating. A number of us had no desire to eat that much food, and were unhappy about being charged a mandatory price for food we weren't going to eat anyway. ESPECIALLY as the restaurant had agreed to allow us to order individually.    They kept reiterating that is was for our \"benefit\" as we would get food at different times unless it was family style. We kept repeating that this was not an issue for us--we just wanted to be able to order individually. So we sat there for an hour, as one person after another discussed it with the servers.  One of our group finally was \"allowed\" to speak with someone in authority, at which point they relented and allowed us to order individually. An hour. It took an hour before they would agree to follow through with the original promise.  Overall, it was a lousy customer service experience. The restaurant tried to back down on their agreement, and then tried to out wait us. Just terrible.",

Do much yo choose from! I had the mussels Fra Diavlo, 1 Caesar salad, 1 spinach salad, mushroom ravioli, eggplant parmesan, and a dozen lemon cookies (since it is carry out, ice cream wouldn't work out so well)! By the time I got it home, it was still hot, even the bread!   The mussels were very well flavored, with the Fra Diavlo sauce having just the right amount t of spice. I cannot get over how smooth and cheesy the mushroom ravioli was! Didn't eat the eggplant parm yet, gonna dive into that tomorrow! The lemon cookies were amazing! Very light and lemony! I had placed my order just before 8:00pm and scheduled it out for pickup by 8:15pm (the first time slot available), by 8:20pm the hostess had arrived with my order. I know I put pressure on the cooks with such a short wait time, but they made it work! Will definitely be going back there for a sit down meal, as it was so enjoyable from my own home!",

It is however made to order and above the quality of most other chain restaurants.  Tiramisu here was the best I have ever had. I am still pretty new to tiramisu as I have only had it about five times but wow is it really good here. I will probably stop in just for the tiramisu every time I go shopping at fashion show.

Dealt very briefly with the booking coordinator named Lori who was so unprofessional that I would not have booked this venue even if it was the LAST restaurant in Las Vegas. I am a local business owner and I am shocked at how a restaurant like Maggiano's handles their guests.  Extremely disappointed since I have used Maggiano's in the past for graduations, etc.",

    "text": "When it comes to italian this place is my favorite in Vegas ! Great place to take a date or your whole family, please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there. Lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.  Right from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had!  Some of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the chopped salad or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% Sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go!  As for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! My favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and meatballs i absolutely love it! The chicken parm is fantastic as well! In all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review! Now for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well!   I strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! Also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem!  Enjoy :)",

    "text": "Overrated.  Ugh.    I have eaten at Maggiano's a couple of times and I have NEVER had a good experience.  It was the same story both times - they tend to serve customers based on who looks like they're ballers.  I guess that means I don't look like I'm not balling out of control, because I always have to practically beg for a drink refill.  It makes me wonder what it is that makes them classify people that way... I was dressed in nice business attire... so did I look like a redneck or something?  Was it because I was young?  Either way, the Maggiano's staff needs to wise up:  you never know who someone is and how well they will tip by appearances alone.  Just sayin'.  The food isn't that great either.  During both visits, my fiance and I ended up with pathetic salads, burned or under-seasoned entrees, and virtually no service whatsoever.  Both times, something had to be sent back because it was either made incorrectly or was disgusting.  Pathetic.  Get it together.  Is there something I'm just not \"getting\" that makes this place so special?  As far as I have seen, the elitist attitude from the servers amounts to jack squat.  They can't deliver on any front - food OR service.  This is another scenario where I really feel like you're paying for ambiance, and as I always say, I can't EAT ambiance.    I know!  Maybe I should go be a baller at the local McDonald's - I could order the entire dollar menu and I GUARANTEE the food would be better than Maggiano's!",

Long story short, 17 of my closest girlfriends and I visited Vegas. We made the reservation, then made our choices for appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. We showed up 45 minutes late on a Saturday night. I was having panic attacks the entire way to the restaurant because I WORK in a busy restaurant, and I know the repercussions of being almost an hour late with a party of 18 on a Saturday night. They were very patient, and we had an amazing private room...it was in a wine closet. So fun! Our waiter was awesome. The food was okay...typical Italian (upscale) chain fare.",

I love the four cheese ravioli with the pesto alfredo.  As Rachel says...YUM-O!  The maggiano's chopped salad is also great.

I really regret not taking pictures of our food but I was enjoying it so much that I was too busy stuffing my face and didn't think to pull out the camera.   I'm a total soup girl, so after hearing the day's selection of soups, I decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup. When it arrived my jaw dropped. I asked for a cup (or small ...whatever) and it arrived in a huge bowl!! The portions were huge! I even waited and double checked with our server that they didn't make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that's the small one\". Well, the soup was delicious. It was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  My mom ordered the \"small\" Spinach Salad and that was delicious as well. Never had roasted red peppers in a spinach salad and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. We would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!  Okay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcake Sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"Crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. Served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the Seared Salmon Sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). THOSE WERE THE 2 BEST DAMN SANDWHICHES I'VE EVER HAD!!!! OMGGGG!! Sooo yummyyyy!!! I think it's funny that we were at an Italian restaurant and didn't have pasta but I am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious!  We were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers, happily! LOL! We were very happy with our lunch from Maggiano's and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to Vegas.  Although I am in the Bay and heard there's a Maggiano's down in San Jose, I rarely head down to the South Bay so I doubt I'll be visiting that one. I highly suggest the location in Las Vegas!!   p.s. Excellent service as well! Oh yeah, and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice! The weather was perfect!",

It wasn't even that busy! But we waited patiently for about 20 minutes so that wasn't horrible. And then our cocktails took at least 20 minutes to arrive at the table. Once we ordered, my soup came out eventually. I had two bites and then the entrees came out. By the time I finished my soup, the cheese on my pasta was no longer hot. Gross. Overall it wasn't a terrible experience, but the previous times were much better. I guess that's why I gave the 3 stars. It wasn't terrible... Just made my eye twitch",

I ordered a special, Chianti Beef, it was a little salty for my taste but my brother said it was great. I tasted some of his Garlic Shrimp Linguine, which was good but the noodles lacked flavor. I also tasted some of my mom's Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta which was the best in my opinion. It was full of flavor, but not too much. My family did critcize that the noodles were a little overcooked though, but I found it perfect. i guess it depends on your preference and how you like your noodles. Now i saved the best for last, I would honestly go to Maggiano's just for their garlic mashed potatoes.   I have ever only really tasted two chef's mashed potatoes that i liked previous to this dish, but this is definitely in my top 2. It's hard to describe, but you just have to taste it. It's the perfect blend of ingredients, not too salty, good consistency, just try it! I'd seriously go all the way to San Jose from SF just to eat the mashed potatoes.   Food took a little long to be prepared. Service was pretty good. Our waters got refilled, but nothing extremely special or eyecatching.",

We placed our order and I had asked for lemon with my water.  As she was busy, I waited and waited and waited.  Finally asked the bus boy for some lemon and he brought it almost immediately.  She \"happened\" to walk by, saw the lemon and said \"Oh, you got your lemon?\"  I told her that the bus boy had brought, her response \"Yeah, I asked him to, just checking that he brought it.\"  WTF?  She lied!!!!!  From when we sat down to when we were served our appetizers, an hour had gone by.  When we asked the waitress about our appetizers, she became a  little aggressive and said she was doing the best she could.

Our server stated it was just simply seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.   It tasted really good and I wish I asked for more.  Having kids also has its perks.  From the kid's menu, we ordered the lasagna.   The portion was enough to feed a family.   Lots of meat.  Very filling and we liked it alot.  Didn't care much for the soup I added to our meal.  Tuscan-something, I forget the name right now.  But it had beans in it.   Won't order it next time.  I think you have to ask for the complimentary bread though before they bring it out.  My server didn't mention it until I mentioned bread.  Maybe it's so you can possibly order other appetizers.  Great for lunch or dinner whenever you're around Fashion Show Mall.",

I've tried to recreate it but can't get it right.     Our service wasn't the greatest but it was still decent.   Thus meal was one of the better meals we had this weekend plans s it was cheaper than a few carry out type meals.... Crazy!!!!",

    "text": "Was pleasantly surprised to see an affordable Italian joint in Las Vegas strip. Their lasagna was very good. I'm usually quite picky with lasagna too as I had amazing lasagna on my trip to Italy. This one at Maggiano did a pretty good job at an authentic lasagna. Definitely recommend ordering this one here. Price was pretty decent too as it only cost about $11-$12. Luckily even though this is a franchise, food was very authentic and it certainly didn't feel like eating at a franchise.  My friend ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which was amazing. It was breaded chicken stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. The angel hair pasta was in house made and it was cooked perfectly.   The portions were very generous so we didn't get a chance to try the desserts but definitely would be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "This visit was to celebrate Alicia R's birthday.  The Wonder Twins (aka Terri R and Alicia R) invited me and you know I am not turning down a good meal with the hottest twins in Las Vegas. Besides, it's been forever since I step foot in here.  It's had to be at least 5 years and I've been really missing out.   I've only been to one other Maggiano's and that one is located in Costa Mesa.  Maggiano's use to be the place where my favorite sister would take me for my birthday.  All I remember from Maggiano's is a lot of good food, huge portions, great service, and long waits even with a reservation.    This Maggiano's is a lot similar to the Costa Mesa location.  This place was packed on Friday, great food, huge portions, and great service.  Only difference, which is a big one, there was zero wait.  I had their Parmesan Crusted Tilapia which was really good and the portions had to be triple of what you get compared to other restaurants. The $20 price tag is pretty good considering that I had over 10 oz of great tasting fish.  After my meal, I washed it down with 3 scoops for their Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  I offered to share, but everyone in our table had their own treat.  I didn't want to put my dessert to waste, so I killed it.   There's not too many Maggiano's around in any city.  I believe that this is the only one in Las Vegas.  I've never had a poor experience at Maggiano's and recommend if you're looking for fine Italian food with huge portions.   PS:  Happy Birthday to Alicia R. (aka Terri R's twin, aka my 5K partner, aka my half marathon inspiration, aka Yes, and aka the former Finger Printing Lady).  Ha Ha...and more nicknames to come.",

(Hmm maybe forgot about me not a big deal) they took care of me they sit us outside by ourself (again not so bad the weather was awesome) wait staff our first served was very distant (because we refused drinks and went with water and no appetizer as I want dessert ) then we got another server and he was awesome super friendly brought me a straw (that I asked previous server twice for) I got vegetable primevera and it lacked flavor I had to add salt and cheese also not enough vegetables for something being named vegetable. Most of my pasta was clumped together but not mushy! My boyfriends spaghetti and meatballs was good.",

Once again when you're in such surroundings with the view of the nice settings of the Wynn's, cascade, beautiful outside lamps, you expect to spend a nice time.  I had the Italian tossed salad to start with that consists of Iceberg, Arugula, Kalamata Olives, Red Onion, Pepperoncini, Garlic Croutons & Italian Vinaigrette and my friend had the Maggiano's salad made with Crispy Prosciutto, Red Onions, Blue Cheese & House Dressing. With the blue cheese taste his salad was perfect, mine missed some savor. He had to ask for some fresh grated Parmiggiano cheese to make it more tasty.  Then my friend had the baked ziti that came with Italian Sausage, Pomodoro Sauce, Italian Cheese Blend and he really liked it. I had Four-Cheese Raviolis with Pesto Sauce that was good too but not out of this world because of the Pesto Sauce that was probably not home made or too creamy. Since Pesto is made with Olive Oil so I don't think they should add cream in it. That makes too rich. Especially with the cheese that is already in the ravioli definitely no need to add cream.  So if you want to eat an Italian (americanized) dinner with a nice surrounding book a table on the terrace at Maggiano's. Cheap place for the Strip location. Valet parking available with a lift that takes you directly to the restaurant.",

The greeters were super friendly and funny...I always appreciate a little humor. People in the service industry on the strip can get so jaded dealing with tourists.   Reservations were not needed during off peak hours. We came here around like 2 pm, and we were seated immediately.  We ordered the fried zucchini, ravioli, and Maggiano's salad.  HOLY MOTHER OF **** the fried zucchini is amazing. I don't know where they are buying their zucchini, but the pieces were gigantic and barely fit on the serving platter (let's try not to think about GMO's for the moment). And my goodness, the tangy creaming sauce they bring with it...so good! I could've eaten ONLY this.   Maggiano's salad was a spectacular burst of flavor. I normally hate blue cheese, but it was nicely tossed throughout the salad with crispy pieces of prosciutto. The prosciutto was a little overcooked, but that was really my only complaint.   Our waiter was prompt, but unfriendly. I don't think I saw a smile the entire time. In fact, he seemed a little annoyed we were lavishing in our \"girly time.\" He could stand to take a couple notes from the greeting staff at the door, they were so nice!",

Love the fact that they have a specific menu where all proceeds go to the make a wish foundation. Love the view of the strip from the restaurant. Had the lasagna and I thought it was delish!! My husband had to be difficult so he had them make him a specific  pasta that wasn't on the menu and they did so without hesitation.

We got calamari (easily the best I've ever had), stuffed sausages, and mussels as appetizers and 2 types of pasta as part of the group menu deal. Dessert was some tasty cookies.  There was a friendly old man (not sure if he was staff or someone they hired to come in sometimes) singing to couples and people who had birthdays. At one point, the whole restaurant sang happy birthday to this guy with fake Elvis muttonchops. The atmosphere was very comfortable.  I highly recommend this place and I will definitely eat here again!",

This place isn't bad but the parking is a gigantic hassle at the Fashion Show Mall.  My usual Italian spot has free valet at The Forum Shops. Food was reasonably priced and service was good. Would I come here again? Well, if a motor vehicle is involved, then I'm headed to Caesars which is so much easier to deal with than this place. If I'm in the areas on foot and hungry, I'll go back into this place. Gave it three stars because of the parking and secondly, it's not as good as Carmines but it does not suck.  Prices are cheaper though than Carmine's but so are the portions.",

We had 120 guests, so we took up all of the banquet space. The dance floor was packed the entire time thanks to the DJ they recommended to us. We also used their vendors for cake and photo booth.   Sabrina was very accommodating, and quick to respond to my questions via email or phone.   I cannot recommend this place enough as a wedding reception venue. It looks good without any decor, even! Especially for Wynn brides - it is very convenient.",

We were so hungry by the time they called us that we ordered a bunch of appetizers- mussels, mozzarella sticks, and calamari. The complimentary bread was okay... not my favorite type of bread.   I thought I ordered pasta because I saw pictures on Yelp... but it wasn't on their menu. The shrimp & crab pasta on Yelp pictures are different than the menu's shrimp & crab cannelloni. It was actually good though- 3 crepes filled with cheese, crab, and shrimp. Everyone else ordered pasta carbonara and steak. Everyone liked their food so that was good. It was a great experience but the wait is killer.",

Truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review. If there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome. Our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise A-OK review. She was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me. She had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl. Just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her. Great service.  Since it was decent size party we had nine. Terri was able to order family style meal. It reminded me Bucca di Beppo style. Starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and caesar salad. Entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. Dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. By the time got to the dessert was stuffed. None of the dishes had WoW factor at ALL. Some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. Bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. The portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. The pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. The atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. It located in the Fashion Show Mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access.   Overall so many more italian restaurant in Vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better. On this night it celebration BeastMode Terri R. not about the food but supporting family. Happy Birthday Terri R.!!!!",

I had the Denver Steak as I wanted steak, potatoes and vegetables.  The steak was done to perfection and the taste was pretty good.  The Vegetables were excellent.  Not sure why restaurants tend to go overboard on mashed potatoes with a ton of garlic and butter.  I like both but let's taste the potato too.

Food:  Spinach Salad- Tender leaf spinach tossed with diced red peppers, roasted red onions and Gorgonzola cheese, yummy applewood smoked bacon, toasted pine nuts and apple cider vinaigrette.  Tomato Caprese-Sliced tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and Crispy Calamari.   Dinner:  Lobster Carbonara- It  was dry so I would never order it again.

We waited for a guest who showed up a few minutes late, but our waiter was kind enough to check on us while we waited.  Once our guest showed up, we ordered 2 appetizers;   fried calamari- soft and non chewy, seasoned well  fried eggplant- sliced thin, breaded and fried- double yummy'  salad- I don't remember what kind, but they were kind enough to substitute the gorgonzola cheese with mozarella.I had to ask them for more avocado, since there was only one piece in the whole salad. I think the waiter returned with a few more pieces (there must have been a shortage of avocados that day). Plus, the dressing was a little weak and I could barely taste it  (they must have been short on that too).  cream pasta with chicken dish- There was barely any sauce on this and what I did manage to get onto my pasta and fork, seemed to have a nice subtle taste to it. Would have been nice to be served pasta that glistened with sauce, instead of me looking and wondering if there was any on there to begin with. Instead of the slogan, \"where's the beef?\" the guestion of the day, should have been, \"where's the sauce?\"  Service- good food- mediocre' price- moderate  Our waiter mentioned that they'd soon be opening a Maggiano's in Hawaii, I hope by the time that they do, the quality of the food will improve.  Maybe I went on a off day, but I'm willing to give them a second chance.  Till next time, happy eating!",

    "text": "Went here last week with friends and was very unimpressed overall.  When we arrived the restaurant was not busy at all but were told that the wait would be 45 minutes-1 hour.  This was after waiting for at least 5 minutes, standing right in front of the desk, with no one in front of me and the 2 people at the desk didn't even acknowledge that I was there!  We decided to sit in the bar area so we could eat sooner.  We were worried that with the small number of servers there our service would be slow.  But the service from our waitress was actually the best part of our experience there.  We were able to order relatively quickly (I didn't expect superfast service sitting in the bar) but our food arrived and one order was wrong while another was missing a crucial ingredient.  Our waitress immediately apologized and worked to get it fixed.  She blamed the errors on the kitchen - I have no idea what was the cause but it didn't really matter.  In the end one of our party was unable to get her order fixed and ended up boxing it to take home...after waiting over 30 minutes to get the missing ingredient.  Our waitress took that order off the bill which was very generous (and naturally resulted in a very generous tip).  But we were disappointed with the number of errors with our food and slowness in having them fixed by the kitchen.  If the kitchen staff were having a \"bad day\" the management should have been fixing it.  I live here in Las Vegas and normally go to Maggiano's almost every time I go to Fashion Show, but after this experience I have no plans to eat here again.  Hopefully the management will see this review and get their stuff together!",

She kept saying the last name of our party but could t confirm the size just for the party name not to even be Kim. The party waiting next to me that was sent to this door was also as frustrated as my party. Finally a third person asked us if we were paged to the front, asked our name, looked puzzled so she went to the ladies that sent us to the door. Eureka! They figured out how to seat us. And We passed multiple tables our size that were open to fit my size group. How can 5 hostesses and 1 manager no figure out reservation and seating.

The best of the lot we tried were the mussels, and the side spinach salad was okay as well.  As for the veal picata, or the crab cakes...would  pass on them.  Wines in the limited selection are reasonably priced.  Along with the large portions, prices are reasonable.. and that keeps the place packed with patrons... reservations are recommended.",

    "text": "I have always been a fan of Maggiano's. I first went to one of their establishments over 10 years ago in Chicago and have gone to that one probably ten times since. When they opened one in Las Vegas I was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then.   Maggiano's is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless you're super hungry.   On our most recent visit we got Spaghetti and Meatballs, Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Piccata, sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes. As usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food. My niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti. I was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata.   Needless to say that we are fans of Maggiano's and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in Vegas.",

Chopped salad, crab cakes, and gnocchi with sausage to name a few dishes. Everything was perfect. Wait staff was pleasant. A violinist came to our table and even took some unusual requests. Great experience. A must try!",

Other reviews suggested reservations, so if you have a large group or need to make a show, make reservations.  I had the tomato basil soup and chopped salad. Both were wonderful.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. My children had the cheese ravioli's and the penne pasta. They also offer family style meals if you prefer that.  The waitress was very friendly and service was great.  I would recommend this to anyone going to Vegas. so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre.

They called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner. I selected from the Chefs selection menu. Lobster baked tilapia, chicken parmesan, mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions. For appetizers we selected the calamari, caprese and bruschetta.  For dessert we selected creme brulee and tiramisu. Absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate! The meat entrees were all tender and juicy. Nothing was over cooked or under cooked. The food was served timely- longest wait was 5 mins between appetizers and entrees.  The portions and amount of food can be described as ABUNDANT. The customer service was perfect. They allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast! I highly recommend them for special events!",

We had 6 in our group so we took two cars to the venue. I arrived earlier than the rest of my party hoping to put our name down but the hostess wouldn't let us since the \"majority\" of our party was not present...keep in mind we were told the wait would be 40 mins and my party was only 15 mins behind me. I assumed this wasn't the hostess' rule so I shrugged it off. When my party arrived we put our name in and we're told it would be 40 mins max so we had a drink at the bar while we wait. I was supposed to get a text when the table was ready but over an hour (maybe 1hr 15m) had passed now. We check with the hostess and she couldn't find our party on the list. We give her the phone number  and she seemed to try to make it look like she found the party all of a sudden. We were then seated minutes later on their \"indoor patio\", basically tables set up inside the mall.  We were seated at a very small table (felt like a kids table) so we asked to switch tables, which the hostess hesitantly directed us to a table right next to ours. Not a great experience before we even were able to look at the menu.  The food was alright, not worth the price or service experienced. The waiter was very nice but the hostesses all seemed to have an attitude.   The only reason I would go back is the cheesecake.",

We did not have a reso, came for a late lunch on a Wed and got in no prob around 130pm. We had the best waitress in the world and from where we live north of the border at times, this can be hard to come by! Was really pleased with the service! I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was done to perfection with succulent shrimp all over the plate. The pasta cooked perfectly al dente. Large shrimps , I must have had about a dozen of them mixed amongst the butter, lemon and halved cherry tomatoes. My mom's salad (Caprese) was to die for and even though mom had requested salad dressing on the side and it was mixed in, she just let it go and did not say a peep. When our waitress had come over to check on us, she saw the error right away as she had not delivered the food to us. She asked if we would like the salad remade, that it was perfectly fine for her to do that for us! We delcined, but nice touch! The salad was HUGE! Super fresh and tasty, loaded with all the good stuff that makes a salad sing. The bread that came with the meal = cooked on site, very good as well. We were too full for dessert but got to bring half my scampi to the hotel with me. Great value, incredible food and top-notch service. With so many dining options available in Vegas we do not usually go to the same place twice but Maggiano's just hits the spot for greatness and we will return again and again! Gotta love the Frank Sinatra music!",

Our server was very gracious, and the bread was amazing!  I ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which absolutely blew my mind. The chicken was stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes and coated with bread crumbs. The flavors and textures were all perfect!  The best part was that the lunch price was not too price at all! Most of the pasta items were in the low-teens and the portions were enormous!

I could hardly place a drink order with the server because I was so fixated on this overlooked problem. Only compounding the unease, we were placed on the edge of the aisle, the front legs of my chair were on a carpeted area and the back in the aisle ... so I always felt like I was about to fall off my chair. (And this was before the wine!)   Our server was curt and lacked warmth. I think this may have been the result of me being sucked into the tractor beam of the dirty wine glass when I was ordering. We had to ask twice for butter (over EVOO). However, we were truly glad this restaurant was open so late! (Most every sit-down establishment was was closed except Buca and Maggiano's).   While it is chain food and has that \"chain\" quality (frozen), it is still filling and occasionally tasty. If you are a vegetarian, be careful! Many of the appetizers (like the stuffed mushrooms) and entrees use chicken-stock for flavor (which is not posted on the menu). We discovered this \"the hard way.\" Ask your server for guidance.  Maggiano's receives high-marks from us for being open late in this city that seems to close-down everything but the casinos after 10:30. Nonetheless, the walk to the deserted Fashion Mall (at this hour) is truly harrowing (we saw NO security in this area whatsoever) so go in a large, alert group. Seriously.",

Working with Beth, Assistant Banquet Sales Manager was awesome. We emailed back and forth prior to our October 13th reception. She was easy to get a hold of and very helpful.   We had 25 people attend the reception. They put us in the DiCarlo private room. We decided to go with the 2 hour reception, all you can drink/ appetizer food menu. You can't beat the price!! Beth asked how would we like the room sit up. I told her that majority of the people will be standing around socializing but I wanted the options for guests to sit! We had 3 high tables and 2 low tables for people to sit. Worked out perfect!!  We arrived a little early. So we made our way to the bar, which was large! When the married couple arrived, they felt special that their name was on the board when they came in. When you walk into Maggiano's it is very elegant.   The 2 severs for our party, I forgot their names but they were excellent!!! The drinks were flowing and the food was coming out!! Our guests are drinkers and probably were very needy... I never felt the servers were annoyed! They were in a good mood and accommodated us!! They were very nice too!!  The food was amazing, no one complained!! THANK YOU CHEFS!!  Maggiano's allowed us to have a dock station to play our own music!   Since no one was in the other private room we were able to go on the balcony to make toast and and take pictures! The balcony is awesome! I actually wish the party was out there!  The manager stopped by at the end of the night to see how everything went! We couldn't have thanked him more for an unforgettable wedding reception! Our friends and family are still talking about how they enjoyed the wedding reception!  I especially recommend Maggiano's in Vegas for a wedding reception! I can't wait to come back and get dinner here! !",

I had my lunch wedding reception at Little Maggiano's and was so impressed by their amazing customer service, food, ambiance, and patience throughout the planning process and on my wedding day.  I started e-mailing the banquet staff about 6 months out from the event.  Jesse and Kara were absolutely amazing to work with...they answered all of my e-mails within a timely manner.  They were also so accommodating with my various requests.  I was so impressed when I walked in to my wedding reception and saw everything set up so beautiful and all of my guests having so much fun.  Now the food, that's another story....It was DELICIOUS!!!  The portions were big and the food was wonderful.  I don't even have enough words to rant and rave enough about Maggiano's Little Italy!!!  I would highly recommend them for any type of event.  Even my guests were saying, \"this is the best wedding I have been to!\" and I really do owe it to the chefs, wait staff, and banquest staff for making the day amazing!!",

The brownie was dry and tasted bad. The strawberries were still frozen. Only thing good about it was the ice cream.  We were there for three hours. We had reservations and it took them 30 minutes to seat us, we placed our order fairly promptly and then waited for the wrong meal; another 45 minutes for terrible dessert and more minutes to pay the bill.

    "text": "3 1/2 stars to be fair.  I went to Maggiano's for lunch during a business seminar.  Don't you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work?  It was certainly a nice treat for me!  After initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  All served family style which was a bit odd for me because I barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  But ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.  Our appetizer courses came first:  along with warm French bread (excellent) we had the:  *Tomato Caprese - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze  *Mozzarella Marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce  *Maggiano's Salad - Iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing  Pretty good start!  The salad was crisp, but my fav was the Tomato Caprese, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  Very nice!  I didn't try the Mozzarella Marinara in trying to keep with my P90X diet...damn you I say Tony Horton!  Next up was our main courses:  *Chicken Parmesan - Breaded chicken breasts baked with Provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti  *Our Famous Rigatoni 'D' - Rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a Marsala cream sauce  *Mom's Lasagna-Meat Sauce - Pasta layered with Ricotta cheese, meatballs, Italian sausage, and marinara sauce, topped with Provolone cheese and meat sauce  Nice!  All were good.  Unfortunately, I ate like a banshee here...I dug the Chicken Parmesan and Mom's Lasagna very much!  The sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  Oh my thighs...the horror!!!  After the business presentation dessert was brought out:  *Apple Crostada - Granny Smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream  *Chocolate Zuccotto Cake - Chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder  At this point I was too full to have any more!  But I gave in and had a bit of the Apple Crostada.  Yummy to my tummy!  The tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  Good way to end the meal.  Bad way to end my diet!  Food here is great for a chain restaurant.  The ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  It would be very nice for a date night out.  I may just come back here again and actually shell out my Visa to try more of their dishes.  As a note though, I did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  But, one dish could probably feed two people easily.   Thankful for my one day reprieve...I am back to my P90X diet and the ramblings of the Devil's Spawn named Tony Horton.  One more push up or pull up and I think I'm gonna be sick!",

I ordered the chicken Parmesan. The chicken was tough, over cooked and tasteless. It came with a side of spaghetti marinara. The spaghetti was over cooked, mushy and the whole thing was very plain. Needless to say I didn't even eat half of my meal.  My friend ordered some sort of pasta and seafood dish (I cannot remember the name) and despite that naturally having slightly more flavour due to it being seafood, the pasta was mushy also and tasteless.   I asked for bottled water, they brought me tap water which I thought ok cool nevermind... I don't know what they did to the tap water there but (maybe it was the ice cubes they used?) but there was a hideous aftertaste of antiseptic!   Our server never checked on us once, because if so I would have told her I disliked my meal and also ordered another drink. We had to ask her for the cheque three times and after we finished eating our meal and were given our cheque, it was 25 minutes before our plates were cleared.  Needless to say I will not be returning.",

There was no credit card deposit required for a large group. When we arrived we still had to wait quite a while. There was a party of about 20 seated directly behind our table and we were really stuffed in there. There was almost no room and certainly out table was not large enough for 12 people! So we had to stand in the aisle and wait for an adjacent table to open up, so part of our party could be seated there. So, we had a table and a close by booth. This was super disappointing since it was a special occasion and since we had made reservations far in advance and confirmed them. No manager came by to address the issue, offer us a free appetizer for the mistake, or really any sort of apology! Generally, they just didn't seem to care. The food was pretty average and somewhat cold with the exception of the zucchini appetizer which was excellent. Our server was excellent albeit slow, which was likely due to a backup in the kitchen.",

    "text": "This is my first time at a \"buyer beware\" restaurant!  When a customer takes a bite then returns a dish because it's not good, the restaurant doesn't happily take it back... then charge for it anyway. Right? Not normal, Maggiano's - especially for a supposedly established chain upscale restaurant. (It was soggy bow-tie pasta a/ spinach, btw.  Ick. Exchanged for Pizza-Hut quality spaghetti marinara, though they still charged for the more expensive bow-tie - we balked, but they would not budge. Supposedly it came from the kitchen or management, the nice waitress still got our normal 18% tip.)  Bad taste in my mouth from a bland dish and dirty rotten maneuver. First and last time, thank you.  UPDATE: After a whole lot of nudging they apologized and fixed the difference on my credit card.  They also said they were sending a little \"gift\".  Well, now it's been three months and nothing ever arrived.    So for same reason -- careless lack of regard / seriousness for customer service -- STARS UNCHANGED.  The customer service training at this outfit just is rather careless, and that doesn't feel good.  Very nice people, everyone I interacted with, but they lack common classy restaurant business sense.  Maybe it's Vegas culture and I'm used to L.A. and midwest?  I do sense there's a weird thing going on in Vegas service culture.  Anyway, I'm ragging on their manners, but two-stars also reflects the quality of food, it's really quite unremarkable.  Interior modern but likewise absolutely unremarkable.  (BUT, and this was nice, a guy goes around and sings to your table.  Don't know if that's regular.  Normally would have earned a star for that ;)",

He made several suggestions that helped us to decide what to order without breaking the bank or over stuffing ourselves.  We reserved online, got there a bit early and got seated within a couple of minutes.  Rafael explained that anything and everything on the menu could be modified to our desire - different noodle, sauce, substitution of an ingredient, etc. So we ordered the seafood linguine and substituted shrimp for mussels. Came out totally delicious. Appetizers were $4 until 6:30pm so we ordered italian sausage flatbread. Delicious! We were too full for dessert but wanted a tasted of the Tiramisu - our favorited. Rafael suggested the sampler Tiramisu for a fraction of the regular price. We went for it and were surprised by the still good sized portion. Again it was perfect.  Rafael also gave us suggestions for tours and shows.  Our experience was fantastic. We couldn't stop talking about it to our family and will try Maggiano's in San Jose",

We were seated right away even though we ended up 30 min early for our reservation. I had the linguine with clams in the white wine sauce and my boyfriend had the scrimp scampi. His was amazing and they give you about 20 shrimp! Mine was good but I think the red sauce is probably better. It was a little bland so a lot of parmesan helped :)   Get the dessert sampler! It's delicious! Tiramisu, apple crostada, and the cheesecake were the best. The chocolate cake was really not great and kind of dry, and our creme brulee was runny and undercooked.   Overall good prices and good portions! $73 for 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine. I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "My husband and I hosted our wedding reception here after a wonderful ceremony at the Wynn. It turned out to be a great decision.  Location-wise, it was very easy for our guests to get to from the Wynn. We had a couple of older relatives, and being able to drive up to the valet area and drop them off was super.  Planning - the banquet staff was responsive and accommodating. They also took care of everything - saving us the hassle of trying to manage multiple vendors. We selected the cocktail reception package. After signing the initial contract, the only other planning we had to do was answer the occasional email about headcount or food and beverage choices.  Facilities- beautiful banquet room. Our decorations were minimal (some flowers on the tables), but that's all the place really needed. Maggiano's let us drop off the decorations the morning-of, and the banquet staff did a knock-out job of decorating the room for us. We rented out all 3 portions of the banquet room, which was great for our 100-person reception. We also got access to the terrace, which was great for the smokers, let us enjoy a view of the strip, and kept the temperature perfect for the event.  Food & staff - amazing. Everyone loved the food. The staff was quick to respond when food ran out in the banquet lines - new food came out fresh and hot. Bar tending staff was awesome - no one waited in line very long. Also, the staff made my husband, myself, and our photographer \"to go\" boxes with extra food because they were afraid we didn't get enough to eat. How awesome is that?  Do yourself a favor and let the awesome staff at Maggiano's handle your reception. Professional, painless, and the end to a perfect day.",

We arrived about 15 minutes early and were invited to relax at the bar until our table was ready.   Sure enough, bang on 8pm we were strutting through the restaurant over to our fantastic table for two with a killer view!   We ordered a wealth of food and some delicious red wine sangria. The food was perfect (I think we did that thing again, where we stop talking for the duration of the meal, due to rapid consumption of said delicious food). Our waiter could've been around a little more, but was very friendly and responsive all other times, so it's cool.   I'm gonna go head and call this THE place to eat when you come to the strip. The total for appetizers, entrees, drinks, and dessert was easily the same price that the high end restaurants charge for one person. Not to mention the lack of food those \"high end\" places bring to the table! Maggiano's is perfect for dressing up, chowing down, and hitting the clubs and casinos after!",

We were seated immediately and our server was extremely nice and attentive with great recommendations.    We started with garlic bread - garlicky but not overwhelming.  It was good.  I had the chicken marsala, which I really enjoyed, the chicken was moist and the marsala sauce was just enough.  My boyfriend had the baked ziti and he really enjoyed the pasta as well - it was al dente with the right amount of sauce/sausage/cheese.    Overall, it was a good experience.  Will definitely go back again.",

Lunch on the patio is fantastic, and is quite a unique people watching scene. I love their salads, wine menu and chicken marsala.  Usually, the service is great and the kitchen is consistent.  Be careful of the following:Their salads are spot on, but their house dressing  is on the sweeter side.  I personally prefer the italian which is homemade but not nearly as sweet.  Also, if you are not a fan of shaved chicken breast, then you should avoid adding chicken to your salads. It is not your usual chunky  breast.   This establishment is way better than your typical Italian chain, and has incredible  family portions. Salute' to Maggiano's-you keep me coming back for more.",

Of course I always manage to order anything but pasta so I am probably missing the best part.  I've been here a few times and never been there without a 30 min wait.  Nevertheless I enjoyed the service and the food each time I've been there.  It's not cheap but you will for sure leave with a very full stomach.   Personally I find the musicians performance somewhat annoying.  Maybe because I have always come here with a group and it's hard to have a conversation with that in the background.  I am not sure if I was on a honeymoon I would like it either.  Just not working for me.",

The wait was a bit long, but decent considering that it was a Friday evening in Vegas with no reservation. This place is not expensive, especially for what you are getting.  Also, it has a much nicer feel than any other \"family\" Italian eateries without being stuffy.  Once seated, we received pretty good service with a smile.  I wasn't able to try the bread that was complimentary, but everyone at my table seemed to enjoy it.  The apps (calamari and zucchini) were delish.  At some point in the evening, we were serenaded by two men playing instruments.  I have fond memories of Steve singing along, lol.  Everyone also seemed to enjoy their pasta dishes.  This place serves everything family style, so if you don't want to share, be prepared to take a doggy bag.  I ordered the pesto linguine with chicken and it was DELICIOUS.  Warning:  you should REALLY love pesto to order this dish.  We were WAY too full to have any dessert, but the options sounded promising.  Tip:  They have skinny cocktails if that's your thing.  I had the skinny sangria and it was yummy.  Too bad it didn't matter with all of the food that I inhaled!",

Ryder had the angel hair pasta with olive oil and cheese sprinkled on it. We both dug right in when it arrived..which it did very fast. I would give this 5 stars but the server let my tea run out and didnt refill it for about 10minutes after it was empty. Not a huge deal but the tea was really good and I would have drank 3 glasses of it..but I had 2. She was also a bit slow with getting us the check and bringing me the change.

Once arrived, my wife and I were greeted with a smile and my request was accommodated.  Secondly, the table provided was perfect!  Just like I requested. Yahoo! Ordered an Old Fashion with Makers Mark -- again perfect drink!! Kudos to the bartender!! No appies today but our meal was again made to perfection!  My wife had the herb salmon with spinach and I ordered the 16 oz. peppered crusted bone in rib-eye (rare) with roasted potatoes.  10s all over the board.  My wife said she loved her meals.  The salmon just melted in her mouth and and good flavor.  My steak was perfect, right temperature, full of flavor with the peppered crust and balsamic vinegar.  If Rover, my dog, was around, he would have loved the bone.  All in all, Maggianos was just an awesome venue to celebrate my birthday. This review would have been 5 stars but for the level of service from our waiter--if he would have checked in on us more often we would have appreciated it.  Lastly, the gentleman that sang me a birthday song--he's pretty good!!  My wife tried to video the entire serenade but only got half of it.  But that's alright--Enjoyed every minute of it.  Great place, delicious food, well made drinks and good entertainment-- stay awesome Maggianos!!",

So decided to have lunch here and get some Nordstrom shopping done.  Other than pasta, I had been craving fish. Luckily, the waitress sealed the deal on my dish when she said I could substitute my potatoes with pasta. So, I got the grilled salmon with lemon and thyme, sauteed spinach (with pasta and garlic and olive oil).  It was sooooo good. Exactly what I had been craving. Fresh and light tasting fish with my pasta fix!  Friend had their \"famous Rigatoni D\" which is pretty delicious. Rigatoni and penne pasta have to be my favorite kinds of pasta. Prolly because I hate having to \"slurp\" up the long stringy pastas. And mushrooms and onions added to the ringatoni always make for deliciousness and a happy Laurie =)  With it being cold lately, it was nice to end the lunch with some tea. I think I had some apricot or peach tea and friends had the peppermint tea. Great that they had big tea collection.  The service was prolly the best I've ever had there. Had to tip the waitress well just based on her refilling my waters like crazy that day. Kept having to tell her that I was really thristy and sorry for always coming back for refills.",

Tonight, I decided to try the fettuccine Alfredo, it was the worst of the worst!! ,no taste , no flavor disgusting!! Very very gooey like White paste!! The sauce does not even tasted like fettuccine Alfredo sauce. My husband always get his usual the chicken Parmesan, it was Okay, but it could have been better.  I have ordered fettuccine Alfredo in many many restaurants, I even cooked fettuccine Alfredo at home many many times. It was very very disappointing for Maggianos to charge me $15.50 for this pasta dish! Not worth the money at all. But, the waitress , (Shana) she did try her best to make us happy.  I hope  they will improve their fettuccine Alfredo sauce after reading my review on Yelp.",

    "text": "Came here on a Wednesday night at ~7:45pm with a party of 8... the hostess estimated a wait time of about an hour and 45mins; however, we got lucky and got seated in 20mins because a larger party had just left.  Everything seemed to have gotten off to a good start. Once we were seated our server was super knowledgeable of the menu, which was great. Also he tailored the service to our party which had 3 kids, this was also great.  However there were certainly some service failures... we sipped on water for ~25 minutes (yes I timed it) before our actual drinks came in and he would literally ramble off every single ingredient in the specialty menu before letting us order, it was like he was reading a disclaimer off of one of those TV commercials.  I finally ended up ordering the Chicken Marsala and the Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce on the chicken marsala  was creamy but watery and the mushrooms were soggy and looked like they had been left in the salamander for too long.   The Fettuccini was also a little tough and the Alfredo sauce had texture like mayo, not as creamy/runny as it should have been. It was chunkier than the marsala!  Overall, the atmosphere felt moderately upscale and the servers knowledge accompanied by the; however, for the price we paid the service and food quality did not meet my expectations. I would rate the atmosphere 4/5, the service 3/5, and the food quality 2/5  Tip: View is great, atmosphere is moderately upscale, and the service is adequate. If you're looking to impress a date this is a great spot. However if you're just looking for some great Italian food with your family or a large party this is not a good spot for the money.  Tip: Menu is small and it is periodically updated, something to keep in mind just in case you had a favorite.",

Our entrees, fettuccini Alfredo and shrimp scampi, were delicious!! Nice cream sauce on fettuccini and plenty of perfectly cooked shrimp with lemon and garlic.  For dessert, the creme brulee was creamy, smooth, and full of flavor under the crackly sugar top!! We also had the cheesecake which was very good with strawberries.

It is located in the Fashion Mall, which probably warrants the higher prices, but I just did not think the quality was worth the extra $3-$5 the menu should have stated.  They have a private elevator to get up to the restaurant, which is nice.  And don't lose your hostess when they lead you to your table; this place is huge and a maze.  I came here for lunch and we began with complimentary bread.  Given it was lunch, there was a lunch special for half a sandwich, soup, or salad (pick two).  Some people tried this at my table, but it did not look the most appetizing.   I tried the gnocchi with sausage.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sausage was not the greatest as far as flavor.  The sauce was quite good though.    Overall if you are craving Italian while at the Fashion Mall, then Maggiano's will do, but it is pricey and probably won't bring you back to Little Italy in terms of flavor.",

We decided to forego appetizers; and, go to their RESERVE WINE list for appetizer. I selected a great Italian Barolo Pertinance from Piedmont Italy.  It was great!   My entre was their Beef steak Lasagna.  It was just great.  The steak was tender, the Lasagna was super tasty with a great sauce.  It was one of best  Italian dishes I have had outside of Italy.   My wife ordered Light Veal Piccata with a side of Sugar Snap Peas.  She said it was very tender and tasty.  I stole a couple bites of her Sugar Snap Peas; and, remarked they were a gourmet delight.   The CHEFS at this restaurant are trully very professional; and, special. For dessert we ordered Pumpkin Cheesecake; however,we were too full to have any, so we packed it up and took it home.   I must compliment our super sharp, smart, and very professional server Cecilia Salario.  Ceci, as I will call her, was quick to our many requests and needs.  Such as extra water, extra glass with just ice, extra spoon,  taking our picture, etc.  When I return I must request her area!  sincerely,  Ed Altman  Jr.",

The marinara sauce on the eggplant parm looks like it comes straight out of the can like a red paste. It was disgusting. No flavor, no basil, no authenticity (even for a chain). I lived in Italy so I know Italian food well. The apps on the other hand are very good and we got the dessert sampler which is a nice way to try a variety of desserts. Delish. I'd suggest sitting at the bar and just getting apps and desserts, seriously skip the entrees if you're looking for any kind of decent Italian food.",

Our waiter was very good but the food was not up to par.  First off the bread they serve is par baked. So it's not fully crunchy or done. Bleh.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and I had super high expectations Bc it's an Italian place and they're known for cheese. They dip was 75% thinned cream and 25% spinach and artichoke! I don't know if the chef just ran out of ingredients but I am so not paying $15 for something so crappy! View picture for my struggle. The crostini was fine it could be sliced thin get but the dip was just HORRIBLE! They didn't make a thick enough rox or didn't add enough cheese to make the dip thick and they didn't put enough spinach and artichoke! How could the expediter allow this to happen? SMH I'm better off buying a FROZEN pack from Trader Joes!",

I'm not experience in Italian food so I was just ask is there any pasta comes with this dish as I pointed out on the menu because I don't even know how to pronounce it to be honest. He shouted \"LINGUINI!!\" I have to ask what's linguini on top of that.\"LIKE NOODLE!\" Of course I wouldn't ask if I know what's linguini. He seemed annoyed. I felt like u will have those kinda service if u stick with ice water at the beginning. He brought out some bread. But later ask if we want butter after we choke down half basket of the bread. Food take long time to come out but I understand it's busy but my food tasted good that's all matter to me. But I just don't like the service this guy provided. Just because you didn't sale as much as you could or I didn't order as much as I should or maybe cause I didn't know about the food. Educate your customer about Italian food in a friendly welcome way. Not the kind of\"you should know about Italian once you dine here\" way.",

It was 105 degrees out so we were expecting to come into a well air conditioned restaurant. It was kind of warm in the restaurant but it was fine. However they sat us into a booth in a corner and it was so hot because it was enclosed by walls and there was no air flow. As a result I asked if we could move tables to a cooler spot in a more open area of the restaurant. Instead of accommodating us, our waiter told us that we could stand up and walk around the restaurant to see if there is a cooler spot and then he told us we could move if we find a cooler area. We knew it was cooler in the other sections of the restaurant. He seemed very annoyed about the whole situation so we just stayed put. We ordered and got our food. The food was good. However our waiter checked up on us maybe twice and he just seemed annoyed the whole time. He knew it was my birthday because he checked my id and I was expecting a birthday dessert. But he just dropped off the check and left. The whole service was just awful and we got the vibe that we weren't wanted there and we just felt rushed  the restaurant wasn't even busy.   Never coming back here again. It was just a bad vibe and I did not enjoy the service at all.   I got better service at a Dennys.",

After a rather long wait for a non-buffet restaurant (20-25 min), we were seated.  We got the insalata caprese (although they didn't call it that), and the spinach and feta raviolio and manicotti and finished with the creme brulee.  The portions are rather large, so with a guy and 3 girls, the above menu was enough.  The prices were very fair, especially considering it was Vegas and that it was considered a very good restaurant.  The wine selection was decent.  If you're not in the mood to go bankrupt at Nobu, Lupo, or Postrio, go to Maggiano's for some very reasonable and altogether excellent Italian food in a great setting.",

I forgot what I had (No, I wasn't drunk...wait...was I?) but I know it was good and they give good, hearty portions.   The negatives were how crammed-up the dining area is. I mean, if you're claustrophobic, then this ain't the place for you. You can damn near eat off the next table if you're slick enough.   The other issue I had was the 2 serenading musicians. Now, they probably didn't mean any harm but after coming to our table, one of them noticed we were all Black and said \"I don't know any rap but I take requests\" - Wow. Did he REALLY just go there? I had to put him in check and told him to keep it movin' before I show him what Gangsta Rap LOOKS like when a violin becomes a weapon. Needless to say...he quickly got out of there.   Then they misplaced the birthday cake, but later found it...then lost the top that goes over it...then later found it. Yeah, it was one of those nights.   But the food was good. Maybe a tad bit overrated for the price though, especially in a food-ladened city like Vegas.",

    "text": "It's safe to say, I'm a Maggiano's regular. & I think the Vegas location is probably the best one- overlooking the Strip, yet safely located in the Fashion Show mall & not quite 'on the Strip'. Fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the Strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz & beauty of the Vegas lights. While ambiance is a factor in why I like Maggiano's, consistency is the reason I go back time & time again. I don't believe I've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). Unbeknownst to me, at some point, Maggiano's even changed ownership; I couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. I'm part of their email list so I get emails with coupons every couple months. A few no-fails on the menu: tomato caprese, stuffed mushrooms, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), mom's lasagna (had it for the 1st time last nite & it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm I've ever graced my mouth with & linguine di mare (substantial seafood). For dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. Also, keep Maggiano's in mind for Thanksgiving & Christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus & you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. It's easy to mosey in & be seated right away for lunch but I recommend reservations for any time after 4:00.",

    "text": "I've had decent meals here, usually with a few other couples and a few adult beverages. This time with the family it was a different story. My advice-Beware if you order any beef dish. I ordered the Braised Beef Pappardelle, with garlic mashed potatoes as a side. Waiter didn't tell me that it came over pasta and it only came with a small amount of shredded beef. Or did it? Because I never got the mashed potatoes and the description mentioned nothing about pasta. It had obviously been left under a heat lamp because the plate rim was very hot, the food was only warm, and the sauce had started to congeal. I ate maybe a third of it and the bus boy came by and started clearing the dishes. What am I going to do, complain to him? My daughter ordered the filet with asparagus risoto. A bunch of under cooked asparagus, a reasonable amount of risoto and 3 little slices (2 ounces?) of well done beef (filet?) about the size of your little finger. By the way, she ordered it pink, which after verbally stumbling around we agreed was medium. More signs it sat under a heat lamp?",

We had a great view and wonderful food. The waitress and waitors were so helpful and welcoming. We chose the Light option for Family of 4 or more. $23.95/person, but well worth it due to they keep filling the food dishes. ( All you can eat) We ordered the stuffed mushrooms. They were not too bad. The cheese in the middle was crumbly not melted. The mozzarella sticks, well patties. Amazing and big. The Spinach artichoke dip with flat breads was pretty good. Wanted a little more flavor. The sour dough bread which is complimentary was warm and soft. The baked ziti would be better with beef instead of sausage for me, but my friend loved it. Spaghetti and meatball my parents had said it was amazing. I tried the meat ball and thought it had a lot of flavor. We will be returning for the whole package. The atmosphere, food, and view.",

Our appetizers were breaded zucchini and flat bread with sauce and cheese. They were delicious!! We were so excited for the main course to arrive. What a disappointment. The spaghetti was so overcooked it was mush, the eggplant parmigiana was so dry, the Gnocchi was all mush. Very little of the main courses were eaten. The waitress did feel bad cause she had told us it is fresh cooked to order. Some was removed from our bill. We were of course hungry so we ordered the dessert sampler and they were all delicious and big sized for samples. We would not return to this restaurant for a main course.",

We spoke with Marc, the event person and he showed us their private rooms.  Since we had about 90 people attending, it was very affordable.  The menu we choose was a family style 3-course meal with appetizers.  Since we had some older people attending the family style service was great.  It was all you can eat, but they served everything at the tables so no buffet type of lines.  Everything was done through email and a few phone calls and it was done.  Cassie, the second in charge for catering was extremely helpful.  Shop around, but the food is second to none and the service staff during the reception were very professional and friendly.  If you have any type of event in Vegas, check this place out.  You can't beat the prices and the food is awesome!!",

    "text": "First of all, let me say, I made reservations through Opentable. I made the reservations, and then was called to confirm the reservation I made. Sure, okay. They then told me I would not be seated until a majority of my party was there. Four of the five in our party were there at 1:20 for our 1:30 reservations. We were told to have a seat and wait for our table to be ready. Walking in, passing the banquet rooms, quite a few tables were open, tables in the dining room also empty, but still had not been bussed from the previous diners. We were seated at 1:50. I understand that Mothers Day may be a busy time for restaurants on the strip and in that area, but Maggiano's has been there quite some time and it shouldn't be a surprise. We finally got to order at 2:15. As we waited, the bread was plentiful, if a little raw inside, and the requested butter was hard as a rock and unable to spread. After waiting nearly 45 minutes, four of the five of us received our food. One meal had crunchy, uncooked pasta, one meal was oversalted and cold, my personal meal was in a hot plate, but the gnocchi was cold. Not warm, but cold, and the sauce wasn't keeping any heat in. The last diner in our party, heavily pregnant, after waiting since 2 o'clock when we sat, got her primavera 5-10 minutes after the rest of us, around 3:00. The food was oversalted and wasn't particularly good. We had to request the check from our waitress, and instead of bringing the check, she brought the dessert menu. We again requested the check and she said \"so no one wants dessert?\". NO we want the check. It was really a disappointing lunch/dinner for our mother/grandma-to-be and mom-to-be. Will absolutely never return.",

We went in planning on having a romantic dinner for our anniversary and instead it's like we walked into a big family dinner party. And it maybe fun for some I found it a bit overwhelming. Soon as we walked in we had to walk through the dining room maze and to the middle of the crowded restaurant which is expected at 630pm Saturday night. But it was the layout that just crams everyone together. Unless you're in a booth it's pretty much like you're eating with the other tables next to you. It was so loud that I had to shout over to have a conversation with my hubby. It wasn't loud music it was just having so many people in one room talking, even the guy who serenaded us with a guitar I could barely hear and he was right in front of me.    As for the food, awesome! I got the lobster carbonara and it was delish. Lots of lobster, cream sauce was tasty and huge portion, only complaint is a little too much Parmesan cheese that it kinda hides the flavor of the sweet lobster. Hubby had chicken Alfredo and loved it but couldn't finish it (rarely happens). Got the sampler for dessert and it's must if you can't decide on one thing.    Overall not a bad place for good Italian food with family & friends but definitely don't recommend for romantic dates.",

    "text": "So my parents were in town visiting and my dad loves Italian food. We were on the strip and I remembered hearing about this place, so we decided to give it a try. This place definitely has some old world charm, it feels a bit like dining at your nonna's house. In typical strip fashion there were some people in prom style dresses and others in basketball shorts, I love Las Vegas! The place is huge and we were seated in a booth that felt a bit claustrophobic. We tried to maneuver the table a bit, but it was a tight fit even for me, and I am pretty small. Regardless, it was a bustling Saturday night and we were seated within a few minutes and our waiter promptly appeared at our table.  Of course we started with the bread and it was delicious. I always appreciate olive oil and balsamic with a warm and chewy piece of bread. After checking out the portion sizes on other tables, I opted for a Caprese salad, figuring I could scavenge off of everyone else's plates. The slices of tomato and mozzarella were quite large, I like mine to be a bit more dainty, but they actually had great flavor and it hit the spot for me. I usually add salt to my Caprese, but in this case it was perfectly seasoned. My husband ordered the Rigatoni D, which features chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions all tossed in a creamy marsala sauce. It was definitely delicious! I appreciated that the chicken had flavor on its own and each element really brought something to the dish. It was even better reheated the next day! My dad had the baked Ziti and it was also well done. It had a great tomato flavor with a hint of sausage. I stole a little plate and also reheated it the next day for dinner. My mom had the lasagna and it was pretty good. I feel like lasagne is a dish that everyone makes at home and isn't very difficult to make, and they had a pretty standard version.   I was very surprised with how well we ate and even more surprised to learn that this is a chain restaurant. It made my picky dad happy and I would definitely return. It is not the best Italian food in town, but not bad if you're in the mall or on the strip and want a good meal at a decent price.",

The outdoor patio is fantastic and as there's few places on the strip where you can eat outdoors, this is a great option for dining al fresco. Service is good, but it can take a while for your food to arrive.  One of the reasons I chose this place is that they will prepare your dish gluten free on request, if you ask. They also can substitute regular pasta with gluten free pasta.  Good selection of wines by the glass, but it's rather expensive. $16 a glass is out of my league. However, they do have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm Mon-Fri with a selection of beer, wines and cocktails for $6 or less.

I remember seeing the wynn when i came here a long time ago from the windows since it is on the 2nd floor of its structure but you are never sure, especially since i was running on 5 redbulls for the day and had like 4 hours of sleep from the night before. It was so cold and we were hungry and i was leading us to this place that i thought was here and it was...yay!!! The portions here are awesome by the way..too bad its hard to keep leftovers when you are around in vegas - which is what happened to me lol. Anyways, ordered the lobster pasta and there was a good amount of lobster chunks in it. The side salad had a good portion to it too so i would recommend that if you want the veggies. The ciabatta bread in the beginning was tasty and wanted more. Wish i saved room for dessert, not possible here! Oof maybe next time outside of vegas.  Food: 4 stars --- Service: 4 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars",

We had to shout to be heard.  They have crammed every inch full of tables so good luck trying to walk through without bumping someone.  We had the calimari, which was passable but was soggy in parts.  The disappointment of the night was their Steak Delmonico: unevenly cooked, it was drenched in a ghastly sauce from deep in a boiler pot somewhere.  No spice or pepper, and not a whiff of flavor from the fatty meat.  Marbled goodness, this was not.  Ravenous from a heavy workout earlier, I would have normally savaged this piece of meat.  But my body would have to do with a protein shake.  The waiter gracefully took the large remnants of this steak away without any chance of it going into a takeaway box.  \"Dat's Amore!\"",

Even though the food is good, I really don't feel that it justifies the high price tag.  There are a number of basic pastas that you can get for less than $15, but these are bare bones dishes.  While still good, you're going to have to spend $20-$30 per dish if you really want to experience what they really have to offer that makes them great.  The atmosphere at Maggiano's differs between restaurants.  The Maggiano's in Denver has a much more classy, and quiet environment with great ambiance.  The Vegas location is much more noisy, usually overcrowded and the service much more casual.  Here's a few tips; make a reservation online, and in the comment box request a booth.",

Feeling of perpetual movement and panic. Our server was more than adequate but I'll bet he was the best. Food is really nothing. Everything is drowned in a sauce of some kind. Cheese on the table in a jar, so I ask for fresh cheese and get some more shredded cheese in a glass. Class is not available in this place unless it is none.  Saltimbocca is on the menu as Chicken. So, I call ahead to get a veal Saltimbocca. They have no idea what a Saltimbocca is. Sounds more like a Veal Marsala.that they serve.. I ordered a baked Ziti, figured what could they do to pasta. Well, the Ziti was not baked. Just regular Ziti drowned in something. Edible but not what I go out for. I do wish restaurants and others would stop putting names on menus that have no relationship to what they serve. I also wish the public had more respect for itself and did not rave about bad restaurants like this one. Well, at least it's terribly overpriced so I knew I was in Vegas.",

It is a very romantic place with the view of The Strip. The food is so much better the The Olive Garden more authenic in you're face. The food stick to you're ribs. You'll never leave hungry.   F.Y.I This location where you order a glass of wine. They put the wine in a smaller bottle. You pour what you want in the wine glass.

    "text": "We met up with a group of friends at Maggiano's on a Friday evening for one of their birthdays. Due to the size of our party, we ordered family style. This works out better for appetites such as mine, as I can usually help devour whatever is left over.  We went with the larger set-up of family style meals, which looked to be a good deal. As we awaited our appetizers and salads, an older gentleman stopped by the table with his acoustic guitar to sing some songs, he played three (including happy birthday) and wished our friend another happy birthday before he went to another table. And proceeded to play the same three songs (but with more gusto for them); and to the next table, you guessed it... same three songs.   The appetizers came out, we opted for the fried mozzarella and zucchini. The mozz was great! Wish there was a little more sauce on the plates or some ranch. The fried zucchini came with what looked like ranch, so it all worked out. Nope, that is a lemon sauce that masquerades as ranch. When asked for a side of ranch, we were rebuffed with a, \"We don't carry ranch here.\" OK then.  Our main courses began to roll out, this time our table became filled with lasagna, ravioli, alfredo and a go-to Italian dish: chicken parmagiana.  Where to begin? The lasagna had a very pre-made/frozen taste to it, however, Stouffer's tastes more authentic than Maggiano's. Their iteration of chicken parm was ghastly. It seemed like it was cooked in a microwave with its rubbery, tough, dry and flavorless texture.  I did not partake in the ravioli or alfredo until the next day, which is where I messed up. Those two dishes were the best of the four we chose.  Desserts came out and they looked amazing. I, however, don't eat dessert, so I can only go off of the very little that was left to ascertain that it was pretty good.  Onto day 2... I awoke Saturday morning with some serious pain. A mixture of \"I ate too much and now I am starving\" and \"RUN\". After a few trips to eliminate the intestinal pain, I was feeling good again.  That evening, my wife re-heated the leftovers we were given according to the instructions on the to-go containers. Once more into the breach we went, devouring what was left. The ravioli and alfredo I skipped the night before were really tasty and I wished I had tried them the first night.  Sunday morning was a repeat of Saturday morning. Needless to say, I shan't be patronizing Maggiano's again. The service was pretty good, the ambiance was nice. As is usually an issue for restaurants, it was the food that will keep me from going back.",

    "text": "I and my family were staying on the strip and we were looking for a great Italian restaurant on the strip. Yelp and other online reviews were great so we thought we will give it a try. As soon as we went inside, they said the wait time is 15' which wasn't too bad. My sis-in-law had a baby so she had a stroller with her and baby was asleep at that time. After 15' we went inside and they said the stroller is not allowed. My sis-in-law explained that the baby is asleep and it would be nice of them to accommodate the stroller. The waiter told to some lady and she allowed to have the stroller inside. The stroller was kept near the pillar so that it is not in anyone's way. We had 2-3 different servers for this visit. One took the order for water. The round table had 5 chairs but only 3 appetizer plates on them! We were total 4. Had to tell the waiter to get us 1 more plate. Then we had ordered 2 soups (tomato-basil) and since they did not split in half, we had asked for separate bowls. They brought the soup but not bowls! Although we told them to get the bowls, after drinking half the soup from the bowl, still we did not get the empty bowls. Then we told another server to get the bowls. By the time we got empty bowls, soup was done! we had shared from the same bowl.However, apart from their service, the Soup tasted Excellent! For the appetizer, we had ordered Fried Mozzarella with Marinara Sauce on top. The Mozzarella was Terrific and too heavy. We got 4 pieces and just 1 piece filled our stomach! I will surely recommend Tomato-basil soup and Fried Mozzarella!  For entree, we had Angel Primavera with vegetables and 4 Cheese Ravioli. Since we are vegetarians, We had Angel Primavera with vegetables. Although, the taste was blend, except for me, rest 3 of them liked it. To me it was okay. I would have loved it with extra sauce, seasonings and olive oil. It looked bit dry. The 4 Cheese Ravioli was Excellent. Very creamy light green color sauce and light marinara on top of ravioli and soft cheese inside the ravioli and nicely baked cheese on top. Again the Ravioli filled us up with all the cheese..! Lastly we thought (not me as my stomach was Full) to try their 5 Pc Dessert since it looked nice when they brought out for others! well, truly nobody liked any of the dessert except 1 person liked 1 of the dessert. I personally will not recommend the 5 pc dessert. 1 was Tirmasu cake-was ok. 1 was cheese cake-no no, 1 was Apple Crostada-no no, 1 Butter Cake -no-ok, creme brulee-ok-good.  Food Taste Overall -4 * Food Taste for Appetizer and Entrees - 5* Service- 4* Dessert Taste- 1* Decor and feel - 5* Cost- Fried Mozzarella (4 piece)-$11.95          2 Bowl Tomato Soup ($5.95 each)-$11.90         Angel Primavera -$13.95         4 Cheese Ravioli- $15.95         5 Pc Dessert - $12.95 Total - $66.70 Tax: $5.44 Total - $72.14 for 4 people. I will surely recommend this restaurant on the strip!!! Great food!",

    "text": "MAGGIANO'S LITTLE ITALY ... EPIC FAIL LAST NIGHT!  OK, so last night (10/2/13) we returned to Maggiano's Little Italy restaurant in the Fashion Show Center, on the Vegas strip, expecting our usual fine dining experience.  But things went badly awry.    Here's how our evening went: * 5:00 -  check in and immediately get seated in a nice booth with a view of the Strip.  So far, so good. * 5:15 -  finally get some water.  Hmmm. * 5:25 -  finally asked what we wanted to drink.  As we already had plenty of time to ponder, we immediately gave our entire order. * 5:40 -  bread and olive oil arrive. * 5:55 -  bruschetta and salad finally arrive.  Really, 30 minutes for bruschetta and a house salad? * 6:25 -  entrees finally arrive.  No special requests, mind you, just the house special.  WTH! * 6:35 -  we ask for our bill and some take-home containers, so we can head out to our show. * 6:50 -  we sign our bill and head out, thank heavens.  How about the food?  Salad dressing contained some new, hotter peppers than previously.  Wife took a few bites and quit.  Bruschetta was good.  Entrees were very disappointing.  We had our usual Rigatoni \"D\", a house specialty, which is usually excellent.  Not so, last night.  The sauce was so watered down that it wouldn't adhere to any of the rigatoni, mushrooms or chicken.  We had to dunk our bread into it to get any, or it just dripped off like water.    My wife plans to \"doctor\" the sauce a bit to make it workable, and we'll try the leftovers tonight.  Hope she can fix it.  Last night Maggiano's failed badly.  Never had that happen at Gaetano's ... ever.  Guess where we're going from now on.  Dean Herrington",

Once seated, we ordered one of the family style dinners, which included soup, salad, a few entrees, and dessert--way more food than we expected.  Everything was amazing, including the service.

    "text": "My in-laws love this place so we went for dinner with a group of 8 with their CHASE rewards.  First of all, make sure you make your reservations really far in advance. They made them a couple weeks ahead of time on a weekend and there still was only a 5:30 or 9:30 reso. if you make a reservation for a large group of people they make you wait for everyone to get there to sit down. This was annoying because the last two in our party were late and we were getting hungry.  The ambiance was really cool! The lighting is nice for a large group or a date. Their service was ok. The server poured the rest of our bottle of wine and then didn't ask us if we wanted another bottle. We weren't finished with our meal so I thought that wasn't very smart of him.... More $$ more tip...  The food was pretty good for a corporate place. Very corporate, like a Buca Di Beppo or a Macaroni Grill but a little bit better.   I give it a 4 instead of a 3 because I feel it wasn't just \"ok\". The atmosphere and the singer guy with an accordion player accompaniment really stepped up the review from a 3 to a 4 star.",

My server Shanna was a little sassy when I asked for more bread her reply was \"I'll get you more bread when I have time\"  I would've like something a little nicer like a \"no problem I'll bring you some more bread \" but that's my only complaint and I'm still leaving five stars.  Maybe she's mad shit to work on Valentine's Day maybe your man didn't get her flowers maybe she's mad she had to come all the way out to the patio I don't know but overall had a great lunch   I had the meatball sandwich and a cuppa soup it was great",

I love the food, and the portions are good enough to take some home rather than eating it all (which is nice, because of the price of some of these dishes...ahem).   However, I am noticing a trend at this Maggianos - one that involves a lack of customer engagement and also a lack of respect for customers in general. A specific waiter, who I have had on several occasions, continuously causes friction at tables. This includes treating customers with less respect and also speaking ill of customers to other waitstaff (I have personally witnessed this very thing). This particular waiter is so awful I aways request being seated in a different section now rather than having to put up with him and his antics.  So, while I like Maggianos, I caution those who dine there. While the food is 4 stars, the customer service is meh.",

It's splitting hairs from a 3-1/2 to 4 but, my family will go to Maggiano's a few times a month -- 1) because my son loves pasta and the food is generally good, 2) prices are very reasonable, 3) service is good and 4)it's less than 5 minutes from my house.  I do have to tell them to go light on the dressing on the salads. We always get the fried calamari. They're crisp and hot. My son and husband will always get the spaghetti bolognese. I get the seafood pasta. We've also had lasagna as well which is good. I've had their alfredo pasta as well. It's good, and I've had the lighter version as well. Unfortunately, we don't venture too far from these. This is where we get our ordinary pasta. It's consistent.   When we first came to Maggiano's, we tried other dishes like the meats and poultry, but they weren't our favorite. We also went for brunch once for their brunch menu, and we decided that we come to Maggiano's for spaghetti. We've also had garlic bread once and that was the last time we ordered that.",

Also, decor and space is fine-- clean and open, what you expect from an upscale chain.   The bad part: the salads we ordered looked like a pre-made salad that you can buy in a bag at the supermarket. The first time it came out there were wilted pieces and they forgot to add the chicken. They were very apologetic and brought out new salads. This time they came out without wilted leaves, but still the produce was as dry and brittle as the first time. The chicken was also overcooked, dry. Maybe I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't a $13 salad. I didn't expect anything fancy, but I do want carefully prepared and fresh food.   We then wondered if maybe it wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but of their food suppliers--the cost of being a chain restaurant. But then we went across to the street to the Wynn and had a delicious, vibrant, salad.   So though I appreciate Maggiano's eager and friendly service and pleasant decor, I think they would do better to focus on the quality of their food.",

It was packed as we went on a Friday night, but after the experience, you can see why it was so busy. Great food, great drink menu, and the best service I've ever received. Our waiter, M. (I'm not sure if it's polite to mention names even if he was awesome) is probably the best waiter in Las Vegas: polite, charming, and honest. So many times waiters are told to say \"everything is the best\". When asked about dishes and wines that were not his favorite he would say that they were fine but he would really recommend Dish X or Wine Y. It helped a lot that his recommendations were spot on and he wasn't just trying to pad the final bill; a lot of his recommendations were cheaper than what we had first asked about  As mentioned, even though this place had a packed house none of the waiters or waitresses seemed rushed or hurried. The food was cooked perfectly, the view was amazing, and the experience was perfect. The GF puts this in her 'Top Three Favorite Restaurants' category. To directly quote her, \"I love it!\".    I can't believe that this place is a chain. The set up is so nice; dark hardwood, dim lights, beautiful glassware.. It seems so against the whole 'Here's what corporate sent in a box, let's go throw this crap on the wall'.   Easily a new favorite. If you happen to get a male waiter whose name starts with the letter 'M', be prepared. You might just get the best waiter in Vegas.",

They make my favorite pasta dish (spaghetti with red clam sauce) here and it certainly did not let me down. So much flavor. The bread served when you sit down is fresh and delicious, and was made even better with the oil and vinegar blend served alongside (the italian way, no butter necessary). Service was excellent and the food was hot and fresh.  Atmosphere and music were just what you would expect from a fine Italian restaurant.  No complaints here.",

I had been there before and knew I would love the food, but sometimes restaurants will let you down when they have to fulfill an order larger than say 8-10. Not so here. My party was about 40 people, and the food and service was top notch. From the catering managers to the actual staff the day of, everyone was professional, accommodating, and very warm and friendly. I honestly cannot complain about a single thing. Everything I hoped for and expected was fulfilled, if not exceeded. You should definitely consider Maggiano's for a wedding reception or wedding/rehearsal dinner! You will not be let down.",

We ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent. We have the Mozzarella Marinara, Spinach & Artichoke al Forno, Garlic Bread Focaccia, and Italian Tossed salad. For dinner we ordered Gnocchi & Italian Sausage, Four-Cheese Ravioli, Baked Rigatoni Pomodoro, and Braised Beef Ravioli. The main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked. I could not even eat the gnocchi...it was like eating balls of paste.  This restaurant is highly rated by many on Yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but I will find it hard to return after my last experience. I don't think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed.",

I was staying in Vegas and got tired of eating at the casinos so my friend and I drove around looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for Maggiano's.  He had been to one in LA before so we gave this one a try.  We were seated right away and, being the klutz that I normally am, I spilled my water all over the table.  Our waiter was super nice and friendly and joked around about it (aka he teased me).  He brought us bread right away and when I spilled water on that, he brought us another basket without us having to ask!   I ordered the garlic shrimp linguine and my friend ordered the braised beef canneloni.  We both loved our meals but I think I filled up on bread so I couldn't finish.  We didn't have room in tiny mini fridge in our hotel room so we didn't take home any leftovers; our waiter seemed almost hurt by our almost full plates of food.  I usually don't like creamy sauces but my pasta was very delicious and flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (I find that with pasta, the shrimp is often overcooked).    The decor was excellent and everything looked very clean.  I didn't expect much from a restaurant on the second floor of a mall but it was amazing.  I will definitely try and come back here.",

After about 45 min, we went up to the counter and asked how much longer our table would be.  The hostess checked their list and looked a little flustered... as if our name magically disappeared.  She immediately seated us.  Our server was pretty good at first.  I got the \"famous\" rigatoni D, while my bf got the beef cannelloni.  Both our dishes were very very salty.  For the beef cannelloni, they were very generous with the beef, very sparse on the pasta, and the carrots were undercooked and very crunchy.  My rigatoni was a very big portion, but so salty I ended up drinking all my water for half the dish.    This brings me to my second qualm...  once we got our dishes, our server went MIA.  It seemed like everyone around us with bigger parties had very good service, while we waited and waited for him to even acknowledge us.  We had to ask for water and even then it took 5 min to get it.    Overall, I'd say the restaurant was overpriced (we ended up spending $45 on just those two entrees) and overhyped.  Would I eat here again?  Maybe if someone were treating... and only if I have a full glass of water!",

    "text": "For my mother-in-law's birthday last weekend, my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at Maggiano's, which is an old favorite haunt of his.  Maggiano's exterior is nothing spectacular considering they're stuck on the second floor of a mall, but once you step out of the elevator you're transported.  Giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  The bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back / main dining room.  It was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).  When our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  It wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. However, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet / battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).  The ambiance inside Maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that I was expecting more from the food.  The calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  The spinach salad I ordered was GIANT and tasty; however, I wished I'd stopped there.  Unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale/hard.  It was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and I was drunk, which I'll get to in a minute) that I didn't even think to ask to try GT's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).  The adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  Throughout our meal I was shocked that I wasn't drinking my wine; every time I turned to look at my glass I could swear it looked as if I hadn't touched it.  Turns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with GT's uncle (who'd flown in from Oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  BAD, SELF, BAD!  Perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.  My main gripe, however, was that GT and I had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"OH, SHIT, SHE'S 70!\" when all lined up properly.  But we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  As a result, they read \"OHSH   ITSH  ES70!\"  Also, although the kind/patient waiter did light the candles for us, I got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  Regardless of the reason, I thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on Maggiono's bottomless glass of wine.",

When out server brought over the check he asked if we wanted to order dessert and I said well I don't know let's ask the BIRTHDAY BOY? Hello didn't that ring a bell for our server no! He event asked if my son wanted to see the dessert menu! I was thinking this is the moment to redeem yourself and bring over a complementary dessert like the one all the other servers where bringing over to the tables celebrating birthdays!!! Any who I'm rating it a 3 because the food was honestly yummy even though our server sucked (two thumbs down for him) I do recommend this place for good food unfortunately bad service.",

Not a problem for us, considering we had no reservation and we were waiting for the rest of our party.  Our buzzer was activated almost exactly 45 mins after we spoke with the hostess.  We were seated just about 5 minutes later at a great table facing their floor to ceiling windows which looked out toward Encore, Wynn and Palazzo.  It was a great view at 6:30pm.    The food was excellent. Our order included garlic bread, zucchini fritte, shrimp scampi, shrimp tropheo, lemon chicken and salmon oscar.  Everyone enjoyed their a la carte entrees.  The scampi and tropheo were both such large servings that 2 people could easily share.  Then we ordered dessert, their 5 item sampler, lemon cookies($2) and profiteroles ($2).  All was soooooo delicious!!  And their 5 item sampler was only $9.95 -- but each of the samples was a portion fit for one person as a normal serving!   All of the food tasted fresh and extremely flavorful.  Service could have been a bit faster but one has to take in to account that many large parties go to this location on The Strip at Fashion Show.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  Other workers also pitched in when we asked for anything.    Parking is a bit unconventional, especially if you dine at late evening/night because obvious parking would in the mall's garages.  However the Mall does not stay open as late as Maggiano's.  I would suggest parking at a casino across the street to save yourself the confusion.  All in all, the experience was great and the price was not bad either.  For all items listed above, the total came to about $150 and fed 4 adults and one child with leftovers.  I will be going back in the future and would happily suggest Maggiano's to anyone!",

The seating is comfortable and we really enjoy it. You can wait at the bar if your table isn't ready and take your drinks to your table when you're ready to go.   Today we had a party of six. Typically out party is this many or more and seating is never a problem. Always make a reservation so that you don't have to wait very long.   Items on the table as appetizers this time around were fried calamari, sausage and peppers, artichoke dip and steamed muscles in a white sauce. All were delicious.   I had the chicken parmigiana and could not finish it. The operation was very large. I got two chicken filets and spaghetti which was enough for two. So delicious. The rest of the table finished off their dish and would have probably liked the juices from the plate if we were not watching.   For desert, we all ordered the brownie, the sweet cake, tiramisu, ice cream and coffee. All winners and a great way to end the meal.   One thing I've noticed is that dinner is always two hours or longer. Today's meal was three hours long. Wow! This happens every time we go so expect a VERY LONG NIGHT if you're with a large party.",

    "text": "Maggiano's is a family favorite for us.  The food is always delicious and this particular location is gorgeous since it's facing the Strip from the Fashion Show Mall.  My boys all love pasta so when they're craving a really good spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna, we come here.  I've tried almost everything on the menu over the years and I've never ordered something that wasn't really tasty.  Every now and then though, you order something different and it's a mind blowing experience.  Apparently, I've been sleeping on Gigi's Butter Cake!  I've tried all the other desserts and love them so I finally tried the butter cake and let me tell you... it's their best dessert on the menu!!!  For those of you that haven't tried it, get it the next time you're at Maggiano's.  You're going to love it!",

Everything they make is from scratch and it shows....they start you out with yummy bread and olive oil..... next to the olive oil is fresh parmesan cheese...it's like they wanted me to mix it with the oil and eat...done.   I had the baked ziti...my first bite had me closing my eyes. I paired it with a Pomegranate martini that was perfectly mixed. They take a complementary picture then sell the regular 4x6 to you because the complimentary one is the size of a quarter...pic is cute though so they win on that too.",

We ordered the family style/unlimited entrees of calamari, eggplant Parmesan, chicken Parmesan, and others I can't remember. For dessert, we had the creme brulee and pound cake. The food was mediocre...nothing stood out for me. The pound cake was really delicious! I also ordered a Moscow Mule but their ginger beer was way too overpowering, I had to pass it up for water.  It wasn't as busy as it seemed to be when we first sat at the table but lots of birthdays were celebrated and for my first time there, it wasn't so bad. I'd go back but I wouldn't recommend the family style since everyone likes different things.",

We were group of four and didn't have reservations so we opted instead of waiting to sit out in the open area of the mall which was well it and well-staffed. Everything on the menu looked really good we decided on the family style Meal which was a really good decision you can choose from several appetizers, main course protein, pasta and dessert.      Our server was Ramil, he was very helpful at suggesting different dishes to try, we decided on the mozzarella marinara  and crispy pepperoni risotto bites for our appetizers the pastas were spaghetti with meatballs in marinara sauce shrimp scampi we also ate  baked salmon in lemon butter and chicken parmesan we finished it off with a very decadent chocolate cake and Tiramisu The entire experience was wondering member next time in Vegas this will definitely be a stop",

They have both indoor seating and patio seating, but either one you can see the strip which is an amazing view.   The menu had a variety of options and the portion sizes were generous. The pricing was average, for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer we spent $60. Our server was absent for a lot of our dining experience, but we came earlier in the evening so maybe she was getting ready for the dinner rush.   There is plenty of space inside for small or larger parties. It wasn't upscale, but not super casual either so jeans and a nice top were fine for dinner.",

The bad: The seating is uncomfortably tight. They have squeezed in as many tables as possible. It almost feels as if you are dining with your neighbors.

The lights are super dim, so sometimes you might confuse a vegetable for a piece of chicken or vice versa, so be careful.   We came on a Thursday and it was packed. We had reservations but still waited about ten minutes. Upon being sat, service was a little slow. We didn't get our drinks until about 25 mins in. Our server seemed busy and was forcing conversation, but the service wasn't bad. We ordered calamari, caprese and spaghetti. Many people don't know this, but on the classic pastas, you can ask for an additional entree and take it home for two dollars extra. When we asked our server about it, he gave us an \"oh you know about that\" kinda thing which I didn't really like.   Also, the calamari came with a nice piece of hair in it and when we told our server he wasn't very understanding about it. It seemed as if he was bothered to have to cater to switching out a plate.   Overall, 3 stars. Not the best but not the worst.",

Here are a few examples:  A) Drinks - I ordered a red Sangria and although it came out as a somewhat Sangria, it was overly full of a lot of carbonation.  It was almost too disgusting to drink.  How can you mess up Sangria in an Italian restaurant?  B) Meatballs - Ordered this as an appetizer and it was full of garlic...wayyyy too much.  I suffered from major heartburn from this later.  C) Salads - Only have one dressing and wouldn't take other request or have other dressings.  D) Lasagna - Too much oil and grease, also contributed to the heartburn.  Also contained too many onions.  Overall, I don't think I will be back.  I'll stick to Olive Garden or a place that can serve True Italian food.  Was not happy about the service nor the food.  Waited a long time in the bar area for someone to take my order.  See attached picture!",

    "text": "So many good expectations... heard so many good things about it.  The places was packed and required reservation so I figured it had a good reason.  Ordered the chicken marsala.  An appetizer in the form of dry bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar arrived and provided the first hint.  Now for the chicken marsala.... first, the sauce tasted nothing like marsala, it tasted like the good amount of caramelized onion that was in it and that's it. The breading tasted 2-3 weeks old with freezer flavor and the chicken it self was extremely hard as if it was boiled in water for 2 hours. This was very surprising considering the fact the place was very packed and you wouldn't think they cook food in large batches and keep it frozen for days/weeks.  I haven't been to any other Maggiano's and want to believe they are much better. In general, restaurants in Vegas are not based on return customers so they let them selves slack. (I did eventually found good Italian food there though)",

The bread was very good...crispy outside and soft center.   I ordered the Lobster Carbonara. The pasta was cooked al dente, as it should be.  The sauce was creamy and tasty. It has pea pods instead of single peas, which I liked better anyway. There was plenty of big chunks of lobster throughout, and only a few pieces were the opposite salty, bitter side of the claw.  Too many restaraunt slip those pieces in instead of the sweet delicious side of the claw. Not this place....plenty of real sweet lobster. Yum!  A little pricey, but the portions are huge, atmosphere elegant, and wait staff superb. So worth it!",

I alerted him to the fact of my lifelong, life threatening allergy to fresh and salt water fish (I can eat yummy shellfish, yes, the opposite of most). He immediately told me he would get the head chef to come speak to us.  Chef Eric Anderson came out immediately, spoke to me about my menu choice, took notes! and assured me everything would be done to assure my safety down to no possible cross contamination. You could tell he was sincere and took this very seriously which was so wonderful as, unfortunately most restaurants can't be bothered, or just tell you to order something else. This location is one of their Busiest, yet they accommodate food allergies with such care and compassion, it proves, all you need is a little integrity and humanity.  Both my dish (crab cakes with arugula salad) and my husbands (filet) were perfection.  Do yourself a favor and ask for Nestor as your waiter and treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience.",

When you step inside, suddenly, you've left the hustle and bustle of the strip and have a place to simply enjoy the food and the service which were both wonderful.   Our server that evening was polite and welcoming. It felt like I had a favorite aunt who was there making sure I ate enough because I was too skinny (which I am not lol). We gave her a big tip and she jovially waved good bye to us as we left.   The food is great here too. The dishes are generously portioned with bold flavors and a great adherence to the heart and soul of traditional italian dishes (or at least their americanized version). Highly recommend taking a trip here if you want a solid dinner at a great restaurant.",

The second time we had mussels, lobster carbonara, and strawberry pie for dessert. Both times the mussels were some of the best we've ever had. The chicken caprese with its olive tapenade was far superior to the bland tasting lobster carbonara. Both desserts were excellent. Portion sizes were large. Coffee both times was lukewarm and on the weak side.   The service the first time was exceptional. Extraordinarily attentive, professional yet friendly. The second time the server was pleasant, but the bread came late, silverware was missing for the coffee, as was the cream. The entree arrived before we finished our mussels (which we were eating at an average dining pace.) The appetizer dishes were not removed from our table for several minutes after we finished so we moved those dishes to an empty table next to us.  This would have been a regular spot for us if the service had been similar the second time, but now we will go back just for the mussels - they are to die for!",

Kevin was especially helpful and even accommodated a appetizer swap.   Military discount eased the bill.  Classy place, good food, would go back.",

We got to the restaurant about 10 minutes early and were told we were way to early for our reservation and was asked to clean me back when it was our time. So we ended up waiting in the restaurant at the barstool area. So when it came time to sit down we were stopped as they didn't put chairs at the table and waited for them to put them out. When we actually got to sit down we had our drink order taken. That seemed to go smoothly, but as soon as it came for the first round of appetizers there was no room to set them down so they took them away. 20-30 minutes went by before they brought them back out and they were the same ones and they were cold. The salad was really good no complaints there. Then the entrees came and we are but they missed an item or so. When he told his manager about the issue the manager was a utter and complete weasel. Did not try to fix it just come out and go around the problem. For my first time here. I will not be back.",

I had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband had chicken Parmesan. Huge portions that we had wrapped up for later. Our daughter inhaled her ravioli. Included in her kid's meal was ice cream. Instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it. Loved that!!!!!!   Price was decent. Food was terrific. Service was fabulous. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "I've always been a huge Maggiano's fan. Yes, it's a chain but the quality of food is that of an Italian, family owned restaurant. The service is always just as impeccable and I'm glad to report that the same experience that I've always had at Maggianos carries over to Vegas as well.  We happened to make it during Happy Hour although it was a sheer coincidence. We started off with the chicken balsamic flatbread for $4 and a couple glasses of wine for $5. Woohoo! The chicken balsamic was divine. All of the flavors and the light and airy flatbread really helped make this a light but delicious appetizer. On to the entrees. I had the mushroom ravioli with braised veal. The sauce was lick-the-plate good and I found myself scooping up as much as I could with my fork. I don't feel that the veal added much when eating it in the same bite as the ravioli, but I ate it separate drenched in the sauce and I preferred it that way. My husband had the chicken and shrimp ziti and while it was good, it wasn't anywhere near as good as mine. I like my ziti spicy and this was pretty mild in comparison to my personal preference. We also had the creme brulee which had a little bit of orange liqueur in it, as well as a strawberry on top. YUM! Best part of the meal, of course. I'm a sucker for burnt sugar and custard, what can I say, but I thought that the orange really added something different to the dish.   Our waiter gave us amazing service (very attentive) and he was also very attractive--two unrelated things, but hey -- I have to appreciate a fine looking person when I see one.  My only complaint was these jerks next to us allowed their three children to run across our half of the restaurant. It was all I could do to not get up and ask the mother to control them. One of the other waiters asked her politely twice to please take stop allowing her children to run around like it was Chuckie Cheese, but she continued to allow them to knock things off neighboring tables and climb all over booths. It reminds me of a Yelp Talk discussion a few weeks back about why children shouldn't be allowed in fancy restaurants. I never had much of an opinion on the issue until this experience, although I can't knock Maggianos a star on it, as they did try respectfully to take care of the situation.",

The menu has a massive selection of dishes to choose from, including vegetarian choices.  My favorite dessert that I have enjoyed for over a decade is the chocolate zucotto cake.  Service is usually excellent.  My only complaints are the outrageous prices on everything, but especially pasta dishes.  Also, there are too many tables crammed into the space so everyone is sitting on top of each other.  In my opinion, there is nothing special or romantic about that kind of atmosphere.  With so many people, it tends to get far too noisy.",

    "text": "When the first words out of the server's mouth are, \"So! Did you hear the great news about Osama?\" I question how the meal is going to go. Let's leave the politics at home, please.  I've never been the biggest fan of Maggiano's. Used to eat there in Florida from time to time. Sure huge portions can be a good thing; if those huge portions actually taste good.   Bruschetta dish was eh. My pasta was soggy. They brought out the wrong one and had to go back to correct it. The meat sauce had hardly any meat.   Overall a disappointing meal. An upside was the private corner booth they gave our party. I felt like Al Capone. . .  Would recommend steering clear of here. It's about the show here, but the execution and delivery leave A LOT to be desired.",

    "text": "Maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant, with a good location, great food and excellent service. If you're looking for that restaurant where you want to fell comfortable with the whole family this is it, I come here every time I'm visiting Vegas with my four years old daughter (of course she knows how to behave in a restaurant).  The location is perfect, specially if you're planning to do some shopping since is located right there at the fashion show mall and if you're  lucky you might get a table with a nice view of the Wynn and Encore casinos across the strip. The food is great,  some of my favorites entrees are the Lobster Carbonara, the Rigatoni D and the Chicken Manicotti, all good and  the portion of food is more than enough. The excellent service is based on my last visit. I made a 7:15pm reservation but we arrived about 20 minutes earlier (Vegas traffic unpredictable). I asked them if we could be  seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves. Nestor was the name of the waiter, he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers, wine and desserts. Simply GREAT SERVICE!!",

The first option was too close to the busboy station so, very noisy you can imagine so, we decline that and accepted another table. Which was extremely wobbly and uneven. Someone even spilled a glass of water as soon as we sat down. So, probably not an ideal spot if you have a huge party. We had 6.   Now,  I don't normally do Italian food because, it's just too heavy and the portions are huge! I've heard so many good things about this place and I had to try it. We don't have a location in KC. It's probably a good thing for my waist line lol.   I tried one of the classic dishes. Baked ziti! Yummy! Presentation could have been better but, it was very flavorful, meat sauce was on point, the right amount of cheese and the pasta was cooked perfectly :)",

It can be busy around dinner time so just be prepared.  They have a great bar with lots of selection and a very big menu. One of my favorite dishes that actually isn't on the menu (but they will make it for you) is the spinach and artichoke dip. So yummy and so creamy! Their bread is freshly baked and comes nice and hot.  I always order the lemon salmon and it's normally served with spinach and I sub for asparagus and they don't seem to have a problem with changing anything on the menu! If you don't see a pasta that you want they can easily make one for you! (My sis does that)  The staff is pretty nice, I mean they are pretty busy so you might not feel that they are \"paying attention\" to you but overall pretty good food!",

I guess another plus is it's designed for sharing. Bring a group and pass the serving platters around to try some of everything!  My issue is the food. It just isn't particularly flavorful or interesting. I mean, the dishes have sufficient salt but otherwise, they seem flat. The pasta is consistently over-cooked without a hint of al dente. Also, it is very far from authentic but the name of the restaurant contains \"Little Italy\" which signifies American Italian rather than Italian Italian. You've been warned.   The service, on the other hand, is always on point with friendly and professional wait-staff.   I'm glad I went to the bar first.

The Summerlin location does not open until 4pm Mon-Thur. The setting and location here is just as beautiful as the Summerlin location though. It has all glass windows and sits directly across the street from the Wynn inside the Fashion Show Mall. Perfect for taking in some views of the Strip.   As with any Maggiano's location though, it is upscale and more expensive than say Olive Garden or Buca Di Beppo but part of that is because of the elegant atmosphere. There's also a lot more seafood dishes to be had here. The food, however, is well worth it and signing up for their E-club will get you some good discounts.",

Maggiano's service & ambiance:  Classic classy maggiano's restaurant decor with an attractive full sized with plenty of dark wood.  This particular location has huge glass walls that provides nice views of the strip to add to your dining experience and ambiance.  Some servers have been better than others but consistently everyone has been great.  The kitchen is pretty quick with getting dishes out even when busy af.  Maggiano's cuisine:  I usually start off with their crispy and tasty calamari for the table.  The side salads are borderline full size and the spinach is my favorite.  The fettucine alfredo with chicken is one of my favorite dishes here. Alfredo sauce is on point with fresh fettucine noodles.  The lasagna is also delish if you're really hungry as it's heavy and packed with flavor.  Maggiano's is the best Italian chain restaurant imo with their consistently tasty dishes.  This location is particularly great because of the great views of the strip that visitors and locals can both enjoy.  Cheers!",

Most tables have a good view of the strip and you can see all the LV action below (restaurant is in the 2nd level and large glass walls allow for good views).  The food is consistent with other Maggiano's I've enjoyed. Solid Italian food, large portions, and great sauces make Maggiano's a good choice for Italian.  Our waiter on Saturday was friendly, quick, and funny. We never waited for refills and the food came out quickly. He was attentive and interacted well with my kids (6 & 10).  We even got a free family photo by an in house photographer. Full disclosure - the photo I attached is an upgrade and not free but even the free postcard sized photo was good.  Good overall experience and really good food.",

Literally after the bread & these appetizers your stuffed.   I got the center cut filet mignon. So good! Asked for broccoli instead of asparagus.   Sister got chicken parmigiana with mash potatoes instead of pasta. Super big meal! 2 pieces of meat & 2 scoops of potatoes.   Brother got the chicken francese. It was really good and his potatoes were crunchy. Different then mine.   Sign up for emails to get discounts sent to you & to get notified for deals.  Soup is not the best.",

For main course we ordered Parmesan crusted tilapia with whole wheat pasta and Mediterranean sphagetti. The sauce in the tilapia was very flavorful, capers adding the right bit of saltiness. Pasta didn't have any salt, not sure if it was intentional. The Mediterranean sphagetti had good flavors with the olives and tomatoes, tasted like the usual but didn't disappoint at all. Portions were huge, we packed half off. Highlight was the butter cake with strawberries. Absolutely right combination of rich butteriness with whipped cream and strawberries adding the flavor and tartness. Happy with the meal, ambience and service. Will come back!!!",

We started off with stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta. The mushrooms were tender and flavorful, I loved the soft mozzarella that came with the bruschetta. Next was Maggiano's Salad. It's a simple salad with few ingredients, but it was so yummy and refreshing. The small bits of prosciutto add just a hint of salty crunch, I like! For the main course we had their salmon and one of the chicken dishes. Both were juicy, creamy, and flavorful. We also had baked ziti and a chicken Marsala type pasta. Everything tasted delicious, super satisfying and filling.   Located at Fashion Mall, we parked in the structure just below the restaurant and the elevator brought us right to the entrance. It's a beautiful, HUGE restaurant. Different dining rooms and a large bar. Dark wood furnishing. The staff here were all very friendly.   Perfect place to host a luncheon or dinner party!",

Similar to other Maggiano's, there is a lot of dark wood decorating. But what separates this one from the others I've been to is the huge glass wall on the west side of the restaurant overlooking the Strip (facing the Wynn and the Palazzo). The place is bright and cheery. We snagged a table by the windows so we were well positioned for people watching. Like other Maggiano's, a touch of class with cloth tablecloths and napkins. Also like other Maggiano's, the service was spot on. Stephanie, our server, came by shortly after we were seated, told us of the specials, got our drink orders, and gave us some menu advice that saved us a couple of dollars. We each got a side of the chopped salad ($7). Surprisingly large portion for a side salad. And a beautiful presentation (see photo). Very delish!!! Then we shared the lite version of the Chicken Marsala ($21.50). Just 670 calories and delish. No sacrifice on taste or portion size by going with the lite option. They also offer \"mini-desserts\" for $2. But after going with the lite Marsala, didn't want to throw away the effort of being good by getting dessert. An excellent dining option when at Fashion Show (or anywhere on the north end of the strip).",

I had for dinner their Angel Hair Pasta with Langostino Lobster with Saffron Cream Sauce| Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes| Stuffed Mushrooms| Followed by Chocolate Cannoli Cake and Five Dessert Sampler which both my friend and I shared but could not finish because it was a lot. Yum-O! Oh so delicious! Loved everything! Food is always great here. They also have another location in Downtown Summerlin. Our waitress was very friendly and gave us great service also!

I am a pretty picky eater not in that I don't like most things but more so when I'm craving certain flavors that's what I want.   When I saw the chefs lobster pasta on the menu I knew that's what I wanted but with a few changes: I used gluten free penne pasta, removed the bacon and asked for pink sauce (red and Alfredo).   It was absolutely to die for and may just be my new favorite.   I also love the vibe of the space; it's much more casual than one would expect but has a good ambiance without being too stuffy.",

Very tasty food, great kid meal ($6 includes drink, meal and lemon cookies or ice cream)  Our son loves his spaghetti and giant meatbal, Hubby and I shared the Italian sausage flatbread $14, and each got a side salad $6 each.   Lovely server and delicious food.  What's not to like?  Plus it's close to the Lyft stop (in front ofForever 21)",

Once the chef himself even came out to offer an alternative to one of the chef specials. He was willing to make something special to our liking, which was super cool. We ended up ordering off the menu after his suggestions though.  We like going for a later meal so usually the service is super good as it isn't that crowded. Tonight we went a little earlier and our waiter had one large table that took up a lot of his time, which made our service suffer a bit. But, we weren't in a hurry thankfully. We usually like to try the monthly chef specials, however, we've tried a number of items off  the menu and haven't been disappointed.",

The food was fresh the calamari was tender the salad was crunchy and crispy and the flavors were delectable. I spoke with one manager briefly I believe his name was Jesse he made sure I was well taken care of and was enjoying myself, another young lady who is a manager and very beautiful also make sure I was well taken care of I want to say her name was Christmas? She had dark reddish brown hair with bangs and she was tall and stunning but very professional if only I could of have the courage to ask her for her phone number. Stephanie is a great bartender and made a wicked delicious sangria it's always good when you can't taste the alcohol in your drink that means it's really good! I will definitely be back and hopefully I'll run into Christmas and Stephanie, those ladies are awesome and easy on the eyes to.",

    "text": "Normally, as a Vegas resident, the last place you go for a good time to drink is the Strip. Sure, it's great for all those vacationing there. But if you live there, you know that you can save the Strip for the tourists. Maggiano's Little Italy is the exception to this.  The happy hour is one of the best that I've experienced in Las Vegas. Boasting $2.50 appetizers and well drinks with $3 premium drinks and beers. This place is a great place to stop after work. You have to get there somewhat early or be forced to wait outside. The dining area is a bit cramped. But it's best just to situate yourself at the bar.  The appetizers are tasty and not of your typical bar flair. I usually favored the calamari and tomato mozzarella. Free Italian bread with Vinaigrette sauce make it even more delectable. All the better to wash down the drinks with.   With the main dining so close and the tunes of classic jazz standards overhead the ambiance can be busy. But it never seemed to escalate over a dull roar. So keeping conversation is never a problem. Along the walls are classic pictures of \"Old Vegas\" and it's easy to get stopped along the way to the restrooms and take in these old photos as if you were in a museum.   The bartenders pour a mean drink and remember the locals well. This isn't an easy feat when you serve as many drinks as these guys do. Each bartender has their \"specialty\" drink but don't push it down your throat. Ask bartender \"Chris\" about his Poma-tini. It's a pomegranate flavored martini that is refreshing, smooth, and very drinkable.  Sadly, I've never had a full fledged meal there. The happy hour was always enough for us. I have indulged in a slice of the cheesecake, which gives the Original Cheesecake Factory a run for it's money. The filling was smooth and creamy and the strawberry topping tart and sweet. And the best part was the price. Only $5 for this massive chunk.   Maggiano's Little Italy inside the Fashion Show Mall is outstanding and I recommend this place to any friends who are visiting.  The only think keeping this place from a Five Star Rating is the fact that it does get very busy and sometimes the bartenders tend to lose track of you.   Four Stars for: Great deals Strong drinks Super Hour Tasty appetizers",

I had Maggiano's book marked so it was the obvious choice.  Pulled into Fashion Show Mall garage, and I just happened to park right by an elevator that led directly to Maggiano's... Already winning.  Out the elevator we walked into what looked to be the alternative entrance with a sign that said go to the main host booth up front.  It was a little awkward at first walking all the way through the restaurant to get to the front but it gave us a chance to admire the place....   Loved the atmosphere and decor. Fresh bread was good but pretty basic, slight disappointment there as I was kinda expecting something that would blow Olive Garden's breadsticks out the water.  But they did have some legit olive oil on the table. We ordered the Chefs Special Lobster carbonara and chicken fettuccine.  The lobster carbonara... just might be the best pasta I've had.  Perfectly made creamy cheesy carbonara sauce infused with the flavors both the smoked bacon and the lobster was crazy good. My wife's fettuccine was a huge disappointment in comparison.  It had an off taste that she nor I did not like.  Fortunately we were able to take it back, I sadly gave my wife my dish and I ordered lasagna, which was super good too, easily one of the best lasagna dishes I had. I was also told they are willing to do custom pasta dishes where you can pick your noddles, sauces, and items in the pasta.",

Usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but I really could not tell the difference. The party/family style is definitely NOT worth the price. I do admit that Maggiano's is probably not even comparable to Bucca but still they overprice their food too much when I could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business. It doesn't help that it's on the strip. The service is great! Make sure if you go on a holiday or a very busy weekend to make reservations!

However, I just tried the lobster carbonara $27.95, based on all the pictures and recommendations here on Yelp and I was SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED!!  My dish had HARDLY ANY LOBSTER!!!  There were minuscule pieces here and there and that was it!!  The dish was mostly bacon and peas.  The peas were good but I was looking for the lobster - where was the lobster I have seen in the Yelp photos??  Was I just there on a bad day where the cook said forget it, no lobster for you?!!  Cumulatively I don't think there was an inch of lobster in the whole dish.  Seriously, I would NEVER order this dish again.  I'll be back for the other items though, but this was a $27 mistake!  Oh yeah, service is always great, but minus one star for the forgettable lobster pasta dish.  Order the clams or the shrimp!  It's still my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas, though.",

The bread is very good.  It is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes.  We ordered a few appetizers for the table.  I tried the mozzarella marinara.  It was surprisingly good.  Most places you can tell the mozzarella was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried.  The mozzarella here had good flavor, and the portions are good sized.  To start off my meal I ordered the side portion of the Maggiano's Salad.  I always enjoy this salad.  The house dressing has good flavor.  The blue cheese and bacon add great flavors too.  The portion is large.  For my main course I ordered the veal Parmesan.  The portion is huge.  It comes with a side of spaghetti as well.  The veal is ok as far as flavor is concerned.  I have had better, but it was fine.",

We celebrated in the beautiful Calabria Room (which was one their private dining rooms) which had a great view of the strip, a great patio area and our own bartender. We were also able to play our own music in the room which was a huge plus. My guests absolutely loved the room and they didn't want the night to end. We were able to decorate the room with our own decorations and it looked fabulous. My brother and I selected our food items from Maggiano's private dining menu and the food was fantastic, as well as the service we received from the staff at Maggiano's. Everyone gave exceptional service, from the banquet managers (Angela and Sabrina) to all the wait staff (Bob,Antonia,Michael and Fabiola) all of whom went above and beyond our expectations to make sure we had a wonderful celebration!  Maggiano's Little Italy comes highly recommend to family and friends or anyone who wants to have a wonderful private dining experience, in a stunningly beautiful room with great views, great food and outstanding service!",

We were seated at the patio (nice outdoor area overlooking the entrance of the mall) and after putting down our menus he didn't return. Eventually one of the hostess took our order for us. Our food eventually came but we were not given any utensils, and our water was not refilled throughout our meal.   That aside, the food is very delicious and reasonably priced. I love their pasta and they have cheap pasta options or nicer seafood pasta options. I'm a big fan of cheese so the I love the meal here. Arguably better than the buffet options on the strip which costs too much!",

Started with the CAPRESE SALAD, and had the LINGUINE & CLAMS/ PRIME DELMONICO STEAK for our main course. All of the dishes were great, and perfect for the 3 of us to share. I'd hope that the restaurant makes sure each table to clean before seating new guests. Because the food was good, I'd definitely come back again and possibly change my review. ENJOY!",

Was going to a birthday party on the strip and decided to eat at Maggiano's inside the Fashion Show Mall.....big mistake!  The service was terrible, once we finally ordered, we had to flag down the waiter for drink refills, the table next to us was seated way after us and they received their food (different server) way before ours, once we asked our meals they came right out, food was actually hot and good.  Not once did the server come over to check on us for anything. If we didn't ask to see our server, we would probably still be sitting there.  For an expensive meal, service should be included.  Would not recommend this place at all.  For good Italian food plus service, try Battista's off the strip by the Linx or Nora's on W. Flamingo.",

The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because their special Rigatoni \"D\"'s chicken felt like chewing gum. It was like having to put effort to eat it!! But it's just one dish, I believe plenty of people will have good experience with this place.",

Everything tasted good and we all wanted more of from the starters to the deserts.",

    "text": "First Time visiting this fine restaurant.(January 9,2017 around 8 pm) Definitely not disappointed about it!  It is HUGE restaurant. With seating inside, bar, outside, patio and even when the mall is open next door they have some tables set up there. So seating shouldn't be a problem.  Our waiter was James. What a very helpful and a polite waiter! Always came by to see how we were and asked if we needed anything. TRUELY GREAT!   We ordered 2 side orders of Caesar Salad, Fried Zucchini, Prime New York Steak with Potaoes and pasta dish. We first brought bread to table. Very good. Then were brought our salads. Very good. Then the Zucchini. OH MY! AMAZING! So crisp and loved the seasoning! And lastly our main dishes. The steak is a on the pricer side of things but WORTH it! It was so good my girlfriend took so much away for me!  Overall it was very good and I was VERY pleased with our visit. I will be back when I'm back in town!  Side note. Only thing I will ding about this place is that a photographer comes to your table and takes a picture of you and your guest and then comes back to show you the pictures so that you can buy it if you want to. BUT the one we got was pretty rude with us. Seemed visibly upset when we didn't want to purchase any of the pictures. Gave us some looks but we didn't let that affect our evening.",

The prices are reasonable for a Italian restaurant..  The waiter were friendly and the services were really good.   All the above can be enjoyed best when your taste buds are really pleasured. The food I would say is average, or below average than what the location demands. Their is a room for improvement.",

We usually just sit in the bar area and have drinks and appetizers and whatever we order is always full of flavor, a hearty serving and tasty! A few things I would recommend, the Maggiano's Salad with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto, the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it! The flatbreads, bruschetta, sausage and peppers, stuffed shells and chopped salad are also top picks.   Even if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert, say yes!! We ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee, apple crostada, chocolate zuccotto bites, tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect.   We will definitely be back.

    "text": "We both have responsibilities that do not allow us to get out often, so when it was time for a special occasion, I looked carefully on the net for an Italian restaurant with a traditional appearance and good ratings, trying to match a family restaurant we liked when we were young. Maggiano's is very attractive with dark wood, red and white checked tablecloths, and wonderful smells.  For appetizers, my husband and I had great calamari and fried, crunchy, thin strips of zucchini with a lovely, lemony sauce. My husband really enjoyed the beef with mushroom risotto for his entree. I am vegetarian, so I ordered the pasta primavera, but it was sadly bland, dry, and from what I could actually discern, the sauce consisted of only a very few, tiny pieces of yellow squash in a very light broth--I did not complain to the waiter, because I do not think that our anniversary dinner is the time for complaints.  I think that because I did state on the online reservation that the date was for an anniversary dinner, the table was very nicely located next to the large strip view windows. The restaurant seemed fairly busy, but the service was friendly and functional, but because the table was set for four, the extra dinnerware was removed, and I really do not like having people reach over me while I am seated to snag extra glassware and silver. (I suppose we could have seated ourselves closer to the window, but that makes it harder for me, as I am almost 70 years of age and use a cane, and that seating makes it more difficult for the server to place plates.) We had espresso and sambuca after dinner, and we split a creme brulee for dessert, which was topped with strawberries and delicious, although the custard was not quite set. We took home the uneaten portion of primavera along with a dessert for our son, who was kindly providing care for our handicapped daughter.  My son reported that the chocolate cake was very good. We had quite a walk to reach the parking lot, but a very kind security guard brought me a wheelchair, which was so much appreciated, as was his general good humor. All in all, not a bad memory for us old wedded folks, but it is doubtful that we will return.",

The bus person greeted us and poured us some house water and that was the best thing yet. From then on, our server was non existent. I think I saw the hostess more than this man. After waiting for a very long time, our waiter finally appeared. The man did not even mention his name. Nevertheless, soon enough, we ordered and received our food. We had finished our entrees and our plates were not bussed out our way. Finally, after waiting for about half an hour, we were given the bill. The server had the audacity to mention the suggested gratuity. Off of respect, we still tipped the requested 20% despite it not being deserved. By the way, the server's name was Cesar and the only reason I know this, is by looking at the top of the check. Mediocre service. Perhaps we were discriminated because of our age. Looks can be deceiving. We have well more than enough money to dine in here often. Thanks for the special treatment. This man should be known as Houdini the magician as he was an expert at disappearing. I had a first hand view of Comedy Central. Have had better experiences at Jerry's Nugget.",

Had a reservation and asked for the Best table in the house overlooking the Vegas Strip. Dinner was in typical Maggiano style. Hot, Full of Flavor, Huge in serving size just perfect. I would say the only down side was service. Granted the place was full and the it was a Vegas Friday night. Had to ask for water, drinks, rolls, the basics.  The server was not on his game at all.

Making us move to another table just so you can vacuum does not make it any better! I think I might have ate some of the dust.   Besides that whole ordeal, the calamari was the best I ever had here. THE BEST! I ordered a chicken dish which was blah. KFC prepares better chicken. Its my fault though, ordering chicken at a Italian restaurant is like eating sushi at a buffet in Vegas, IT SUCKS!",

A few chairs were even in walkways and we had to constantly move to make way for other guests or servers. Eventually my wife was so frustrated she went up to the host and asked for better seating. They pulled us from the table and once again we waited for another table. What is the point of making a reservation?",

Minuses: Even though we had reservations, it still took 20 mins before we were actually seated and we had to wait in two different fusterclucked lines - people were bumping into each other and unsure where to stand or go (numerous signs for the \"Host Stand\" were borderline comical, giving an Alice gone through the looking glass experience - but with annoyed tourists); we asked the seater to speak to management (we were there for family celebration,and the evening wasn't feeling terribly \"special\" with this first impression), who didn't appear until 50 mins later (that's because she never bothered to contact himl) - the manager was extremely defensive, admittedly he was probably slightly broadsided by our complaints but still seemed barely receptive to the criticisms and made repeated excuses about \"the layout of the restaurant\" and told us we should've came in via the revolving doors that we almost got whacked with twice because \"most of our traffic comes off the Strip\" (we'd already explained we were locals, apparently we shouldn't come in where the valet is). All in all, we'd have been better off going to a nice local joint like Chicago Joe's - this place was basically a fancier version of the Macaroni Grill.",

    "text": "Maggiano's Little Italy is on the second floor of the Fashion Show Mall, across from the Wynn and Treasure Island on Las Vegas Blvd.   Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in over 20 states. I have eaten at the one in Minneapolis as well as this one. I guess in the hiearchy of Italian food Chain restaurants it goes something like this:  Out of the can and not Italian: Chef Boyardee Slightly better Casual not Italian: Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill A little better if you didn't know better: Pasta Pomodoro  Mid-level trying to fool you as high-end Italian: Maggiano's and Buca de Beppo Higher prices and more Northern Italian: Il Forniao Really great Italian: don't tend to be chain restaurants   Maggiano's has nice ambiance, expensive dark wood decor, and is usually very popular and crowded. In Vegas expect to wait even with a reservation. We had a party of 10, called at 5 and couldn't get reservation until 8:30. Maggiano's is perfect for large parties, as they offer huge dishes that are meant to be shared (most have a half size option, so take it!) They offer a family style approach special menu for large groups, where the cost is $29.95 per person, and includes 2 shared appetizers, 2 pastas, and 2 mains in a bottomless approach. They encourage this, as they will tell you if you order a la carte, it may take 30 - 45 minutes (for Pasta?). we went a la carte because some didn;t want to comprimise into limited selections.   The Mozzarella Buffula appetizer (what they called Tomato Slice and Mozzarella, or something like that) is one of my favorite Italian appetizers. The special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combination, Maggiano's shreds the basil, which I prefer the fresh whole leaf. You get 3 slices with an order.   The Capellini d'arrabiata (which they call by the English name of Angel Hair) comes in a huge bowl with about 1/2 to 1 pound of pasta, roma tomatoes, garlic and a little oil, with some basil, and a slightly spicey arrabiata sauce. They have a couple of lasagna offerings, either covered in a bolognese (ground beef) sauce or in a Marinara. It is huge, like everything is. There is a large menu of good selections for most people.   They don't offer olive oil and balsamic vinegar with your bread, but if you ask for it, they will bring it to you.   If you want A LOT of food and willing to pay over $30 per person for Pasta, go here.",

We said we called to make reservations, but they told us that they didn't take them until 8:30, AND said there would be no wait. Girl at the front desk said oh, we take reservations 90 minutes or more out. Oh okay, please tell us that next time.  We were seated about 30 minutes later, outside (yay!). Our waiter appeared quickly and we ordered beverages. Sadly, none of our drinks - water, coke, or beer - were ever refilled. Nobody even noticed that my husband was out of both water and coke and that I gave him my water to tide him over. Not that we could have notified our waiter; most of the time, he was not to be found.  We ordered shrimp linguine and angel hair with tomato sauce. The half orders, contrary to what we've heard, barely fed 2 adults, and we're not gluttonous eaters. Angel hair was decent, but nothing to write home about. Skip the side salad - it was iceberg lettuce, whole grape tomatoes, and dry croutons. You can either have italian dressing or blue cheese. Apparently, those are your choices.  Our server was very polite, but he was very rushed; it was hard to get him to linger at the table for a moment, and as I mentioned, he never noticed our empty glasses, nor offered any refills. We sat with a pile of empty plates at the end of the meal for a long time before he reappeared and asked if we wanted dessert.",

You will need the walk back to your hotel to help digest the fantastic meal you just ate.  I have eaten at Maggiano's a number of times around the country and now I find myself seeking them out when I travel.  If you like calamari you must try theirs.  I think my favorite dish so far is Mom's Lasagna.  Be sure to save room for the Tiramisu or Pound Cake with Caramelized Bananas.  They also have a very good wine list.",

    "text": "I know this place is a chain restaurant but that doesn't stop it from having delicious food! As you would expect from any decent Italian place the prices are a little high and being right in the fashion show mall doesn't help. Overall the food is great and the atmosphere is what you expect for what your paying.   Now for my favorite part about this place. They have something called a Family style dinner. To order this you are required a party of 4. The cost is about $35 per person and completely worth it! This includes the following: two appetizers,two salads, two pastas, two entrees and a desert. Now you might be thinking wow that's a rip off? BUT WAIT there is more to this then meets the eye. All the items have to be selected off the pre-build family menu BUT the portions are UNLIMITED!! for instance if you order 2 appetizers and you greatly enjoy them tell the server and he will bring you another order of them. Same goes with the salad, pasta and everything else. The kicker here is that you ALSO get to take home your leftovers!  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Italian food! My personal favorite dish is the following.  Four Cheese Ravioli + Ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella, and provolone filling sprinkled with house cheese, then browned in the oven and served in pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara.   It is AMAZING! It also always puts a smile on my face :)",

    "text": "I haven't gone to a Maggiano's in a long time, first time in the Vegas location too.  I made a reservation on the phone for 6:30pm, we got there by 6pm so I asked them if we could be seated.  They were still pretty empty at that time except at the bar where they had happy hour so they sat us in a nice booth seat.  Our waitress wasn't particularly friendly but she did provide good service overall.  She didn't go over the specials either but no problem since I can read it myself.    Ordered the half order spinach salad (I always forget to ask them to leave the dressing on the side.  Did it again this time too and they put way too much).  I remember it tasting a little better but it's probably because there was too much dressing.  I do love my grilled veggies and bacon in it though.  Also ordered the calamari.  It was okay but I wish the marinara was spicy because it tasted kind of plain.  The warm bread with the olive oil and balsamic was yummy.    I only ordered two pastas for three people (waitress said all their dishes are now \"half order\" sized).  Thank goodness I did too because the portions were still pretty big, plus I was already more than half-full from the appetizers and bread.  Got the pesto chicken linguine and the seafood linguine.  The pesto chicken linguine had a ton of pesto, a little too much but when I reheated it the next day, it was so good.  The seafood linguine had a good amount of seafood and the tomato sauce kept it from getting heavy.  We took back over 2/3 of each of the pasta dishes because we were too full by then, even for dessert.    Although the waitress wasn't talkative with us, she refilled our water, checked up on us, and gave me two little rolls of ciabatta breads when I asked her to box the few pieces left to go along with our pastas.  Good service and she was well rewarded with a nice tip.",

Second they ran out of food, or perhaps do not know how to plan well.  Third, they ran TWO HOURS late for our confirmed reservation! Ridiculous- ran out of proscuitto for their own Maggiano's salad!  They obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated. (5:15 reservation, seated at 7:15!) For seven adults, they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table-for seven people!  Then the turkey platter looked like  a sad plate of leftovers-and had one little mound of stuffing- which was gone after it was passed to the second person. We kept thinking that was decoration, and they would bring some in a bowl (aka family style). Same for the ham platter, one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults!  The pasta course however, was abundant --apparently the only thing they know how to cook.  They brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes. Everything was horribly over salted!  The gravy -also they must have been running out of...was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy??   I cannot repeat enough it was HORRIBLE.  Two ten year olds could pull together a better turkey dinner.   They have a lot of nerve charging $40 per person!",

I really hate when servers decide whether to give good service to tables on whether they think the customers will leave a good tip. Our water glasses sat empty for over a half hour while our waiter filled other tables' glasses and avoided eye contact with us. He delivered our salads and then extremely awkwardly reached over us to get the remaining place settings. I understand that might be a corporate policy but why would you set food down, ask if you can get anything else (usually a good indicator it is okay to start eating) and then reach over your guests? Wrong order of things, weird waiter. That was the last time he visited our table before we were finished, leaving our salad bowls for our enjoyment. I also had a discount that said nothing about not being valid on weekends but they would not honor it. The other staff was not super friendly either, so I did not feel that complaining would elicit a response.  This was a one star experience overall but the food is truly amazing here that I have to give them two. They also had the large lunch menu displayed outside the restaurant when they were not serving their lunch menu on weekends. What a weird day at Maggiano's.",

Italian food is always suppose to be very large portions and super filling which is where they kinda screwed up on this particular occasion.    I got the lobster ravioli full order (23.50) and ended up getting a plate with 8 raviolis on it. 8. I finished my dinner in about 5 minutes. (could have been 2 but I was eating slow) I asked the waitress about my order and she said that was a 1/2 order and about 10 minutes later they brought me some more ravioli. Well not much more. 5 more to be exact.    So my advice to you is to only order family style here with a group of people and avoid coming with any less than 4 folks. You just won't get the same bang for your buck.    Nice wine list and there were a few banquet rooms / wine cellar rooms that the dining seemed to be really nice in.    There's a much bigger restaurant right above this one that I am gonna have to try out because it really looked nice.",

The fried zucchini is delicious (they used to have asparagus that was even better), the family style menu is awesome, and the desserts are to die for. They also have a great happy hour M-F 4-6:30 & Sun-Th. 8:45-10:45 with discounted drinks and app's. Tonight I had Baked Ziti, and it was perfect!",

The view from this location is great, because it's right above the Strip, so you can see everything around the Wynn, which is right across the street.   The host staff was polite, the food was quick, but our server was NONE OF THE ABOVE! He basically did everything short of rolling his eyes at us.   What a mood killer. And meal killer. And Maggiano's killer.",

Called in the afternoon to see if we could move up to 7 which they were able to accommodate. Got there and the atmosphere is great. Just a couple minutes and they seated us. Food was family style and amazing. I can't even remember all the courses but there was sublime mozzarella cheese, artichoke dip and bread for appetizers, sirloin, chicken, lasagna and Alfredo and amazing dessert apple frittata was crazy. The waitress was fantastic, completely attentive and helpful in her suggestions. One down was table was in close to other patrons, bumping chairs issue. Probably because we moved up our reservation. One person at the table next to us was total rude jerk (I paraphrase for this review) toward my daughter which came close to ruining the evening, but that wasn't totally restaurants fault. Managers stepped in and gave us a private room to be sure the rest of our night was perfect. This place is top notch, don't hesitate to let management know if you have special request. They're very cool and want to make your experience the best it can be.",

Although i love Olive Garden, Maggianos is much more authentic Italian food. My usual entrees here are the Lasagna, the Rigatoni D, and the Calamari;] Yum Some of their entrees are good but I've realized that most the white based sauces could taste a little bland along with other pastas, but maybe it just comes down to preference.  Also while you're there take advantage of their delicious bread, we had like 3 rounds when we were there and they provide this dip that has olive oil and balsamic vinegar? not sure. But regardless if you want to eat good italian food with a nice view of the strip, you should consider going to Maggianos!  great for big groups, families, and dates:]",

Someone is alway coming around to refill drinks, clear empty dishes and our server tonight, Val, is great. She made sure everything went smoothly, kids ordera were put in so they don't have to wait so long and brought out their desserts just at the right time.

The restaurant's view is gorgeous and the ambiance has a sexy feel to it. The only thing I was not a fan of was the red and white checkered table cloths. Such a beautiful dining room overlooking the strip, soothing jazz music playing in the background with those table cloths...  Our server was very friendly, down to earth and attentive. Our orders came out surprisingly fast, as an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms, we loved it. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which was very tasty as well, Italian food when cooked properly is very comforting. Also another thing that I really enjoyed and just shows how well the kitchen is run, was that the bread for the table came out very warm . I hate going to a restaurant and they serve you cold bread.   Overall it was a great experience! Lovely restaurant, nice atmosphere, genuine service, good Italian food and convenient parking.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Maggiano's while in Vegas for my Daughter's Birthday and we all had a fantastic time.  We are putting this restaurant on our list of places to eat every trip to Las Vegas.  Maggiano's is located at the Northern tip of the Fashion Show Mall, directly across from The Wynn, on the 2nd Floor.  The decor and atmosphere is reminiscent of New York City Italian restaurants.  The Italian speaking host was super friendly and very courteous.  Our waiter Nick was fantastic.  Very friendly, very personable, and super attentive.  All of the staff were fantastic.  We also got to meet the Executive Chef Frank Zmuda who came by our table to wish my Daughter a happy birthday, which was awesome!  All of our dishes were incredible tasting.  Everything is made from scratch, so if there is something you don't want in your dish or are allergic to an item, it's no problem for them to make it your way.  The menu also has traditional dishes but made with less calories.  We ordered the lighter side chicken parmesan, and  fettuccine alfredo, the portion size was huge, the taste was delicious, but about half the calories were missing.  Great taste and less calories, what a deal!  The portion size on all of the food was very generous.  My son ordered a flat bread pizza from the kids menu, and it was so large he could not finish it.  We were there for happy hour and ordered some of the $6 happy hour margaritas, which were better than we have had at most Mexican restaurants on the strip.  They were delicious, and you could tell they were generous pours of tequila.  I had to order a second round of margaritas they were so good.  Because it was my Daughter's Birthday they brought over a plate with cookies and truffles and \"Happy Birthday\" was written on they plate in chocolate.  We also shared the banana split cheese cake, which again probably some of the best cheesecake we have ever had.  The prices were extremely reasonable, especially for Vegas.  I would have paid twice as much for our dinner at any of the hotel Italian restaurants, and the food would not have been nearly as good.  They also have children's cooking classes at different times throughout the year, something my kids were very interested in.  I want to Thank Maggiano's, Chef Frank, and our Waiter Nick, for so making my Daughter's Birthday Dinner so special.  We are looking forward to eating here again on our next Vegas trip.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to our family and friends.",

So refreshing and Dee-lish!!  I really liked this place, only negative is that it is SO crowded. Tables are smooshed together and fairly small. Other than that, so good.

He didn't bring us bread until we were almost finished with our appetizers. Two of our entrees looked great. The chicken fettuccine alfredo looked disgusting. The plate wasn't wiped down around the edges and the sauce, what little there was, looked like it had been sitting for a while. There also was no garnish and the whole dish looked messy.

So, you can imagine how special it is to us. Using Open Table, I booked us for 2/21/16, left a note stating our special occasion and began looking forward to the date. We arrived early, told the hostess and manager it was our anniversary and were seated. Ten minutes (not an exaggeration) later, other than a waiter saying he wasn't our waiter, but brought us water and bread, we had not been greeted or otherwise acknowledged, we got up and left. Needless to say, we found a new restaurant to help us celebrate as we will not go back to Maggiano's.",

Overall a gorgeous window view.  Ordered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an Arnold Palmer. The veal scallopine was flavorful, especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation. There was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal. It was a light bed of spinach and I felt that I could have benefited with a bit more. The dish came with a side of angel hair. As for the drink, it was just your typical Arnold Palmer, half iced tea half lemonade.  Our server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients. At first I thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host, but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well-trained and sociable. I applaud the servers for their knowledge and service.  Overall it was a good experience, but not a restaurant of choice since it's a chain. When I am in Vegas, I prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive Vegas restaurants. I feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown.",

When our plates come out, it was literally covered with crashed red pepper. My mouth was burning and it was completely inedible. I had to pour water over my food to wash some of the crushed red pepper off. The waitress never stopped by to ask how things were.  The other dish also drowned in crushed red pepper was seafood and definitely not fresh, nor was the sauce.   Okay, they were closing in an hour,but if I'm paying full price for food, I expect fresh food not drowned in pepper to mask old seafood.  $60 wasted and had to pay for another meal elsewhere.",

Reservations are a must, but the bar, reception, and dining areas are always so packed full of pushy people. The wait staff is so stressed out by all the drinks, bread, meals, desserts, and checks that they barely have a minute to be cordial. I equate Maggiano's with romance-dark setting, big booths, great music and good food. Well, sadly the place has turned into family heaven. There was every age group of child from infant strapped to his dad's chest, to toddlers in strollers parked in the isle, to children throwing tantrums, to teens glued to their iPhones. Sorry to say, just the sights and sounds of all these children during my meal turned my evening into a spectator event rather than a romantic dinner. I suggest keeping the kids with grandma or the babysitter, but probably most of the kids we saw were tourists so I think I will just try my luck at a different Italian restaurant off The Strip.",

    "text": "Ma-Ma-Ma-Maggiano's I sure love you!  Why? Because you make my tummy happy!  I have been going to Maggiano's on and off since the Las Vegas location opened.  I had never heard of the chain before because I am not really an Italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  I went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!    Before Maggiano's, I was a pasta hater.  I know, I know, I am a weirdo, but I just wasn't into any pasta.  I would only eat it if I had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  That was until I had the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti.  This is in my Top 10 dishes ever.  That very night after eating this dish, I kid you not, I had a dream about it.  Yes, when I have a great meal, I will dream about it.  I still get this dish 99% of the time.  Every time I get it, it makes my whole day.  If I could get away with it in public, I would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because I don't want to waste one drop of that awesome Alfredo goodness.  When I do try a different dish, I often feel like I am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti Yes, I love it that much.  I have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  I really have enjoyed the Chicken Saltimbocca, Eggplant Parm, Lasagna, and the Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  I don't think I have ever heard anyone I was with not like one of their dishes.  Yummy yum.  The kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  The food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  They have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  The kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, I steal my kid's food on occasion.  Every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  This is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  I love a good deal!  One good tip I have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  This particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  They are on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a>, so making a reservation is super easy 24/7.    If you have never been to a Maggiano's, you should give it a try.  And of course my recommendation would be the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti!",

    "text": "I setup a Christmas party for my office employees. Because of the mix up and it being cold, they gave us a private banquet room without any charge which I thought was amazing. Had the family style menu and due to certain allergies they had no problem putting certain things like mushrooms on the side. They suggested delicious drinks and the servers we had were very attentive and friendly. So much food they bagged it to go for us to take with us. Had a balcony which we were allowed to go outside and smoke so that was another plus. We even had speakers and a radio at our disposal. Everything was delicious and setup exceptionally. Very happy with the experience. The tiramusu and their chocolate specialty cake are to die for lol their pasta and meat dishes were on point. Thank you very much!",

It was a disappointment to have ordered the more rich white sauces and receive a quality more like soup. Our server seemed rushed and in the need to go other places than stay attentive to us. He barely checked on us or cared for us. However this may be due to the fact we sat in the bar area. But I still think we should've received more than just a \"check in\" once and nothing else.",

He can never get sick of spaghetti, but i like trying different things... chicken alfredo or chicken marsala seem to be my main dishes :)   The location is perfect! Shop a little til you get hungry, then go to Maggiano's. Or eat first, then shop... either way, its a win-win. There might be quite a wait if you go around 6 or 7pm, but if you go there for lunch or something it works out perfect.",

Him and I were watching the Seahawks vs. 49ers game at the hotel, came here at half time, and were able to get the perfect seat to watch the rest of the game.   I'm not sure if the waitress was training someone new or if the other person that helped was just the bus girl but she was more attentive than the waitress. If just the waitress helped us, I would have said the service is lacking, but since the other lady was there to fill up our drink and bring us menus and take our plates away, I would say it was between average and good.   The food was great. I had the mushroom ravioli. The sauce was delicious. My husband tried it also and thought it was really good. My husband had the lasagna. He thought it was good. The sauce was a little sweeter than I like but it was good.   Overall this is a good restaurant. Good place to stop for a good meal. The prices were reasonable. Check one of Las Vegas's tour books. We saw it after but there was a coupon to get $10 off if you spend $30.",

Below are the usual that we order:  Appetizers: Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms Pastas: Spaghetti Meatball, Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagna Desserts: Creme Brulee, Tiramisu  Pastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.  The only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  We have kids so this was rather inconvenient.",

The family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  They provide a lot of food for their prices.  We started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  It's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Next up was the Beef Braciole.  This dish was quite interesting.  The texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  I can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, I believe.  The spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  You can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs.  We also had the Rigatoni \"D\".  The chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.    They gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  If you love Italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by.",

    "text": "We took the kids to Vegas for Spring Break last week.  Yeah, I know.  Why the hell would anyone want to go to Vegas with minors?  Ask my wife.  Anyway, we needed to find a place with food that was better than McDonald's for the adults and would appeal to our kids and not bankrupt us.  I had the nifty Yelp app on my new, handy dandy Crackberry and it pointed us to Maggiano's.  The app provided many positive Yelp reviews ( of dubious value as usual), a web address and phone number enabling me to call and make a reservation and a map feature that helped us find the place with ease.  We were seated promptly upon arrival and the waiter was very kind to my wife and I in spite of the antics of my three little darlings.  It can be a royal pain to take care of families at a nice restaurant with tablecloths and wine glasses but the service was very good.  The have a full kids menu from which our children were able to choose something they liked.  My wife had some chicken pesto pasta dish which was tasty and I ordered chicken francesca, which was supposedly inspired by the Italian cuisine from St, Louis.  Having become intimately familiar with St. Louis Italian cuisine over the years I think that was a reach but nonetheless my dinner was very good-especially for a chain.  The price was very reasonable and I would love to dine here again but I'm not planning to go to Vegas again in the near future and unfortunately the closest franchise is in Orange County.  Perhaps they'll open a San Diego location some day.",

We were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. We were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. I was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.  From dinner we ordered the Classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. The food doesn't stop. The only hard part was agreeing on what to order.   Appetizers: Calamari Fritte and Bruschetta.  Salads: Ceasar and Chopped. Pastas: Mom's Lasagna and Chicken & Truffle Tortellacci  Entrees: Chicken Saltimbocca and Eggplant Parmesan Desserts: Creme Brulee and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake   My favorites were the Chopped Salad, love blue cheese! Chicken & Truffle Tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the Eggplant Parmesan had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. Creme Brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. I would also recommend the Chianti Castello di Querceto. Went really well with the Mom's Lasagna.  Ryan was our server and he was fantastic. Very attentive and helpful. They even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. The night was great. Thank you Maggiano's and Ryan!",

We decided for our last night in Vegas we wanted something affordable, reliable and relatively quick- we had show tickets and had gotten back late from our tour.  The Concierge at Encore called to get us a reservation and we were seated right at our reservation time (we got there early just in case), but we had plenty of time without feeling rushed.  We ordered the mozzarella appetizer, which was delicious.  Husband has his green salad and of course the fresh bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is a huge hit!   An affordable bottle of wine to share and for entrees, my fish loving husband actually ordered the beef tips!  He said they were wonderful and they came with mashed potatoes with shoestring onion ring crisps- bit he was too full to eat the sides.   I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious!   We passed again on dessert- simply no room because the food during dinner was plentiful!       The location is very central- right on the corner of the strip across from the Wynn hotel- which was perfect for us considering we were staying at Encore and had tickets to the show at Wynn.    We would definitely go back again!",

Last time I came here I had a Caesar salad which was good and is my favorite, but I decided to try the Maggiano's Salad this time. It was good, but it ended up being pretty filling, so I was almost too full to eat my spaghetti and meatballs, but luckily I took it home for later. I don't have anything negative to say about the food, and the wait time was 20 minutes which is average for dinner time in Vegas. Our server was decent...he could have refilled my water/soda more and he had to double check what we ordered even after asking us twice when he originally took our order. We sat by the window which was great for a view of the strip. I don't ever go out of my way to go to Maggiano's but the food is good and so is the staff.",

I was told I do not need a reservation because there are plenty of window tables available. Happy to hear that, we arrived 30 minutes later and... there were no window tables available. When pointing out the information I received over the phone, the hostess seemed pretty annoyed but ended up accommodating us contingent on a 15 min wait. A small yet unnecessary bump in the road after which our server took over and won us over with incredibly attentive and accommodating service. Beverly went above and beyond even presenting sweet surprises, as we were here after celebrating something very special.  As far as the food, he bruschetta was incredible! I can have like 10 instead of an entree. However, I did enjoy the lobster pasta recommended by Beverly. Maggiano's is a solid restaurant, the hostesses can afford to take a lesson from Beverly. Honestly, I considered leaving while dealing with hostesses attitude. Hunger and drive to the strip kept me from doing so, I'm glad I stayed!",

We started our meal off with the calamari which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor and paired our meal with a bottle of Red Blend from Apothic. We also shared a small Caesar salad which was totally big enough to share and it had a great flavor. The place was a little loud but overall a great environment.",

The server was polite, but a bit inattentive.  The stuffed mushrooms were great as was our other appetizers.  Drinks were on time and delicious.  My problem was the veal piccata.  The sauce was perfect but the veal was over cooked and the pasta had obviously been made first and sat in the window, while waiting on the rest of the entree.  I would have said something to the server, but he never checked back until we were ready for the check.  I expected more, as I have dined at this restaurant a couple of other times.  I was also the one who suggested Maggiano's.  Hope more attention to detail is given in the future.",

    "text": "I came here to celebrate Jan 1, the entry of the year. We did not have reservations like the front girl asked but for a busy night, we managed to get a really good table, with a view and right next to the window.   I only had a Chicken Ceasar salad with English tea, which was just really good. I had just gotten out of work so tea was good to relax, and when I got home it worked :) . . . The Ceasar was BIG, I mean a massive amount.   One of the people I went with ordered the special which was Rosemary chicken lemon. I tried some and the chicken was not at all dry it had a very nice taste of rosemary. The mashed potatoes had a sort of herb in them possibly cilantro mixed in. Not sure.   The other person I went with had the Salmon salad, she said it was a bit dry. I'm not sure if that's what it was supposed to be.   You get complimentary white bread that definitely hardens very quickly LOL.   Ever since I've been ordering out, like Zucchini. Which is all very good. I mean they have a BIG amount, so an appetizer to go is good enough.   The server that helped us out that night was extremely polite, and although we asked for a section that definitely seemed it wasn't his he walked over to us many times to check. Very nice and again he walked extra, for a busy night every step you take counts. But it was appreciated.   The ambiance is very loud, people not so much the restaurant or servers, or music but the people it was SOOO loud. Maybe, everyone, there is used to it, but it would've been nice not have that I had this really stressful day at work, since it was the end of the season. I needed quietness and relaxing.   BUT when ordering out during lunchtime it's nice and calm. HArdly anything happening. You have to walk to the very back of the restaurant to order but they are usually quick about 5 to 10 minutes.   I'm sure I'd love to try the rest of the menu in the future. Thank you.",

    "text": "I found this restaurant by chance as my friends and I were walking down the street from our hotel towards Mirage hotel. At first, we thought it would be very expensive to eat there but since it's at the fashion show mall, we thought we'd stop by and check it out. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were pretty reasonable (except Steaks which cost over $40)  I ordered shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and I loved it!! it was very light in garlic butter wine sauce and unlike most restaurant, they put a generous amount of shrimp in there, which was awesome! It was a pretty decent sized plate too, but I ended up eating every bit of it! Yumm!   My friends ordered the lasagna and they both loved it too. Good portion, very meaty, cheesy and delicious. (Yes, I had to take a bite for myself!)  We ordered a bottle of chianti for $36 (I think) and it was pretty good and went well with the food.  If you're planning on having at least 2-3 glass, that would be a better option than ordering by the glass which is usually $10/glass.  Above all, our server was really nice, friendly and fun. I think her name is Lori (?)  Their freshly baked bread was soooo good, nice, fluffy and warm. I am not really a big bread eater, especially before my meal, but I ended up eating 3 pieces - dipped in the olive oil vinaigrette and grated Parmesan cheese. Yumm!    We didn't have a reservation so we were told we have a half hour wait. We were waiting for about 15 minutes but  luckily, we found a table at the bar, first come first serve, so we ended up eating at the bar area, which was just fine by us. They serve the full menu there as well.  They have a nice outdoor seating area as well.  I'd recommend that you call and make a reservation if you have a large group or don't want to wait to be seated.  Sooo, Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going back there, to try out their seafood Linguine!",

Did the family style, and if you never done family style food, well get on it. Its fun.   Great food, from appetizers to entree's and also the desserts.. Everyone agreed the Mom's Lasagna was amazing, the Gnocchi & Italian Sausage was incredible , the  Crab & Shrimp Cannelloni was to die for, and Linguine & Clams, Red or White Clam Sauce was out of this site.   So heads up if you do go, maybe call ahead of time, its a super busy place. We totally lucked out and sat outside since it was nice evening. But inside is very nice. Do you need to dress up? I would say at least wear a collar shirt guys..   Our waitress for the evening was very helpful and very fun. The only problem it took a while for us to get our appetizers, which she apoligized all night long. We didn't mind, we had our drinks in hand and having a good time. But other then that another great experience in the book.. Hope you guys enjoy. Because the food is amazing..",

The 5 of us ordered the classic family style which was I believe $35 a person. Not that cheap, but do-able.  Service was utterly non-existent. Food took forever inbetween servings, we're talking about 20-25 min inbetween each dish...even appetizers..  That's pretty damn bad. As you could expect, we got full just sitting there, so had so much food non taken advantage of.  Maggiano's...not a good way to treat the customers.

    "text": "Perhaps the chef changed or memory makes the taste buds fonder.  S swears this was a better place to buy a meal when last in Vegas.  They seated us right away on a Tuesday evening and the Cesar gave us stellar service.  This is Maggiano's so I didn't raise an eyebrow at $12 for a small glass of the \"house\" red (Cherry Tart pinot noir).  He recommended the risotto fritte for appetizer which I requested and we had the gnocchi in vodka sauce with Italian sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The house bread they bring for free is awesome.  You can season some olive oil with pepper and Parmesan for dipping.  I'd say don't ruin your appetite but the quality of the food gave me pause to cancel that suggestion.  They served the risotto fritte quickly and upon seeing it, they are effectively arancini with pepperoni mixed in.  They are salty but dip it in the marinara they provide and they not only become brutally salty but the sauce obscures any subtlety of flavor in the balls.  By the time they brought our entrees I was starting to get full.  Both dishes suffered from the same affliction as the arancini.  Perfectly good pasta (wonderfully tender gnocchi especially) coated in supremely salty sauces.  I took a few forkfuls and asked for a box (as cold leftovers - once a lot of the sauce fell off was ok to eat).  About $75 for two with tip.  The waiter and staff definitely earned a top review and an extra star but considering the meal quality that only earns this place somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars.",

Very greasy and didn't look like the chef put any effort at all. Started off with calamari which tasted acceptable; the marinara sauce tasted so salty! My husband ordered salmon oscar and chicken frances for me, their food was covered in grease! And that's a big NO NO considering we paid for $90 for those meal! We could have gone some place cheaper and better. I probably wont be coming back anytime soon nor recommend this place to a family member. 1 star for the good service and another star because we didnt wait too long for our food.",

I would give our server a solid B+/A- considering menu explanation, time it took to get his attention, he remembered my to-go order, and we spent less than an hour there from being sat to exiting.  We had: -Side spinach salad with gorgonzola cheese: pretty yummy, I am a fan of gorgonzola but I think huge chunks were a little much, even for me. Dressing was a little heavy. -Linguine & Clam: good broth in the pasta, healthy amount of clams -Peppercorn steak w/ the Maggiano's sauce which was carmelized onion and such: so yummy; a bit salty so you have to eat it with the mashed potatoes but the potatoes had melted cheese and it was so so good.  Do want to mention that this restaurant did not have the classic \"buy one take one home\" menu options that are available at a lot of other chains, though.",

I got so many raves for our reception, and the process was super well done on their part. I was so happy with how everything went, and the communications before the wedding couldn't have been better! I started with Calabria only and ended up super happy I upgraded to include Di Carlo. You can see from my photos how good sized the Di Carlo dance floor ended up being! We also used their recommended photobooth company, and they were amazing, as was the floral company they used, better than I hoped for! We ended up with 49 total people, and you can see from the pictures this was a good size. Although we could have comfortably fit 60 in our space and still had the big dance floor and photobooth area. Our guests also utilized the access to the balcony, which was nice. The bar was fantastic and all staff were perfect. The only thing I would caution is that the speakers in DiCarlo did not work through the house system from Calabria and we did not have a DJ/sound system brought in, so our playlist was not super loud for dancing. We still had a fantastic time but this could have been better, the people there really tried to accomodate us though.  Another good thing about them is they try to get you the most for your money, the packages are all clearly laid out on their website, and they are extremely reasonable with what is logical for your specific event. AND OMG THE FOOD, everyone raved all weekend about our food, the sausage gnocchi being the favorite. You will not regret choosing Maggiano's for your event :) They even arranged a tasting for us in Houston at our local Maggiano's to help decide the menu.  The venue itself is gorgeous so not much need for dressing up, the people are fantastic, and the food is incredible. You can't beat the price either, it was a great value and a no brainer!",

The last time I had this was probably last year.  When my food arrived, I was surprised to find that my potatoes were on a small plate while the nicely cooked salmon, placed on top of bed of spinach topped with capers and lemon and herb butter, was on another.  The salmon was as good as I remembered, but the potatoes weren't the same.  Better!  They used to come on the same plate as the salmon and was plain roasted, nothing unique.  But now, they are nice and crisp and WOW, it adds a different texture as an accompaniment to my fish and I am loving this entree more than ever before!  I usually only finish half of this entree but this time around, I finished the entire meal and yes, I was happily full.  Additionally, our waitress provided our party with exceptional service.  Her service is comparable to that of a waitress at Joel Robuchon (I know, bold statement, but she is that wonderful).",

The service is always stellar and friendly. The prices are decent as well.  The portions are perfect for sharing and you just can't help but savour the wide range of flavour each dish presents itself. There is both a subtly and boldness with each pasta dish. We leave full and content but not bloated and overstuffed like you can at some pasta places. In some ways this is a nice escape from the Fashion Show mall, the views from the restaurant are wonderful, as you sit across the Wynn and the places offers a bit of calm from the strip itself.   I have had a few dishes here over the years and so far each one has been wonderful. Try something yourself as I am confidant that you will experience the flavours and enjoy the atmosphere as much as we do each year.",

    "text": "As I was shopping at Fashion Show Mall I noticed this Italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on Yelp later for a possible dinner option.  According to Yelp this place was worth trying. I used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but I figured why not). I'm glad I did. When we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. We were seated immediately.   We were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. This place had a good variety of Italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. I liked that they had a family style option as well. At first glance I would say this place looks pricey specially since your entree comes with just your entree no salad or soup like Olive Garden.   We ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy French bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!).   Our plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad I would have been more upset.   I ordered Mom's Lasagna made with meatballs and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. I choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. My plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. I ate all of it, in phases but I ate it all. It was exquisite. Perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (I hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart).   My favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (It's Impossible). If it weren't for the Wynn in the background I could almost say I was in Italy.  I don't have any complaints about this place. Our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. We came on a Monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can.",

    "text": "BEST ITALIAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD* (and I'm Italian!)  Every time my girlfriends and I visited Las Vegas we would come here at least twice (over a week holiday) to have dinner. I love that the restaurant serves up food family style (read: larger portions meant to be shared among family and/or friends) which is how Italian people serve their meals at home to their own families.   The food is authentic, delicious and the servers always know their s***. I usually go for appetizers (caprese, zucchini fritte, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, eggplant parmesan, manicotti). One of my friends always raves about the baked ziti.   One of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. We used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. Cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! I even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once.   *Obviously not counting my relatives home-made Italian cooking. And the food is on par with the food served at Terroni in Toronto, Canada.",

We got there and was seated  within 5 mins, granted this was a lunch hour so i'm guessing there were fewer people there.   Personally, i didn't like our waiter. He sounded insincere. i know that they don't really care whether you've eaten there or not, or if the food it good or not, just act better.  We ordered the fried calamari for the appetizer; i really liked it. My mom ordered the shrimp and crab imperial; that was yummy. My dad ordered some lobster alfredo; that was also delicious. I ordered a steak bruschetta(sp?) and it was absolutely delightful! it was the right portion and i loved eating it. since i'm not a food expert, that's all i can give with the food. The blood orange italian soda tasted good too; it comes in a fancy bottle.  Overall, i much enjoyed this restaurant ^.^, but if i ever want to eat legit italian food, it would be at my friend's house.",

The decor in the restaurant looks nice, but the it is a little cramped in the hallways. The employees looked well dressed and clean, and also very friendly. I do have one complaint though. The waiter who boxed our food to go forgot to put the pasta in the box. It's a minor mistake, but my boyfriend was really upset to come home to his incomplete meal that he paid $30 for. Maggiano's price is not the highest in town, but it is higher than an average Italian restaurant. Granted they have higher than average tasting meal, but I'd at least expect them to at least remember something as important as pasta. All in all, I'd still come back because their food tasted wonderful. The veal was really tender, and so flavorful that you can taste immediately without even chewing. Keep it up, Chefs!",

The kids ate Lasagna and Chicken Parmesan both equally good! Our appetizer was the Mozzarella & Marinara very good sauce.

I have been dining at this location for over 8 years, and it has yet to disappoint. Their Chef's are very cautious when it comes to food allergies, and they go out of their way to accommodate nearly any request. They have even made me gluten free fried zucchini that is sure to compete with their original recipe.  Their portions are quite large and reasonably priced, making it the ideal location for large groups. They also have private dining rooms if celebrating a more intimate occasion or hosting a business meeting. Overall, an excellent choice no matter what the occasion. They do get really busy with conventions, etc. so make a reservation in advance. I can assure you that you will be happy with your experience.",

I had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken meatballs and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. The hubs had chicken Parmesan that came with a side of spaghetti.  Everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  Great Mojitos & vodka martinis. The buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  We rolled out of their we were so full.  The place was hopping even at 8:30 pm.",

I ordered a seafood pasta dish, i think it's called Linguine di Mare and tiramisu for dessert. Boy, everything was delicious especially the tiramisu!!! Service was great and it's located at the Fashion Show Mall (my other favorite place to visit while in Vegas).    I also came back here this year, 2012, for lunch but the wait was too long and I was too hungry so I went downstairs to this Mexican spot.  I'll probably try the one in Orlando, Florida this week and the one on Santana Row in San Jose soon. I'll keep ya posted on each visit. Toddles, Yelpers! Try this spot and sit outside!!!!",

Fare is solid American-Italian in a spacious dining room on the second floor of Fashion Show mall. The Linguine di Mare is the stuff of my foodie dreams: linguine noodles (the best kind) in a spicy tomato sauce (not spicy enough for me) smothered in seafood goodness like plump, juicy shrimp, mussels, clams and lobster. My only regret was I had to leave some of the pasta behind or risk blowing chunks atop the Stratosphere after (stupid stomach that's sensitive to stupid spinning)!  My boyfriend's Lobster Carbonara could solve world hunger. There was so much of it! It was creamy deliciousness bathed in lobster groupies. Yuuuum!  Service was pretty slow, though, so try not to come during peak lunch hour on Saturday.",

Brought the issue to the manager and he was nice enough to give it an effort to correct the Bad experience that we had! He even said we can seat us at the Closed station and he will send a different server to us but we're already on our way out of the place. Hope they will not say No! To their guest and try to satisfy them no matter what! We are locals and  Generous tippers! We could have been regulars if we only got treated Good by the Lunch Staff. Very Sad!",

I will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  They're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* PJ Clarkes *cough*).  The private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.  Further, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  Even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  In fact, I usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  Just what I always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......  BUT, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  I've had the chicken & eggplant parmesan, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, caesar salad, stuffed mushrooms, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable.   Overall, they serve up very basic Italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old.....",

    "text": "To many, Maggiano's does not qualify as \"fine-dining\" establishment, primary because it's a sort of \"chain\" restaurant, and probably becaues they occasionally offer \"deals/discounts.\"  Nonetheless, my experiences eating @ Maggianos in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas have proven that Maggiano's decor, presentation of foods, service, food taste, and overall dining experience has proven that Maggiano's is \"fine-dining\" for the regular Joe who likes good Italian food w/o having to skip out on a month's worth of eating out because of one really expensive meal :)  My experience @ Maggiano's in Vegas was actually, to a significant degree, better than my few times at the Grove location; our waiter was actually a waiter-in-training, but despite his lack of experience @ Maggiano's, he indicated he had extensive experience at other restaurants.  The first-class service he provided to us, despite his n00b status, indicated to me that Maggiano's did not hire your commonplace waiter who's only job was to write down what you wanted.  Not only was he able to describe to us in great detail the dishes we inquired about, he was also honest about what dishes he tried and would recommend.  Of course, he did press us a bit to order more than just entrees, so he was successful in getting us to order a few appetizers lol But those appetizers were all tasty and worth the price of entry (like $1-2 a person for our table of 8).    Customizing your entree with a variety of different pastas and sauces, and withholding from certain ingredients is expected @ Maggiano's.  They will ask you how you like things and if you aren't keen on a certain ingredient, the cook will gladly make it to your liking.  This also shows that their entrees aren't \"mass produced\" and  are made-to-order (which is why food takes a bit longer than most to come out).  However, our waiter also promised us that the pasta served was made-on-site and fresh daily, thus enforcing my belief that Maggiano's is a high-caliber restaurant.  Finally, one of the best parts of my experience eating @ Maggiano's is the fact that our waiter was extremely friendly, able to hold conversations and joke around with the group, and also treat us almost like a \"valued\" and welcomed patron of the restaurant.  Yes, we were eating during lunch/daylight hrs and it wasn't too busy, but our waiter made the extra effort and it definitely showed.     Cost for entree & appetizers shared @ the table: $16-20 out the door. For Vegas, that's a great deal for a sit-in restaurant with some amount of class and zero strippers/half naked individuals :)  I will definitely return to Maggiano's LV and hope to duplicate this prior positive dining experiences.",

Mr. friendly - Manager came to the rescue - apologize and make it up with us :) ..--  Bit of advice - the patio -is a little loud so if you are planning to have a solemn or event that needs a quiet environment you should choose their indoor banquets.

However, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.  Me and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  In the beginning, everything was fine.  We ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  He didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  So, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  After he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  Did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  After about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  He comes over and he goes, \"Okay go ahead.\"  He didn't apologize for making us wait.  REALLY??  Wow.  I'm appalled by his performance.  And after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.  The saving grace to our experience was the food.  Our appetizers were the Zucchini Fritte and Stuffed Mushrooms.  I loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  Our entrees were the Rigatoni D and Chicken Parmesan.  He enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  The little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!  We're always going to come back here.  Just not have that older server again.",

As my husband and I had been once before in St. Louis and enjoyed it, we hoped to have the time to try it again. It also turns out that I had some rewards points that could be turned into a gift card here, which presented the perfect opportunity.   Let me first say, the hostess, manager, and our waiter especially were awesome! Professional, efficient, and very friendly. They seemed to be having a great time, which is always a good sign.  The food was also excellent. Between the three of us, we tried the lasagna (with marinara), lasagna (with meat sauce), and the Gnocchi & Italian Sausage dish. All were wonderful.   Also while dining, there were two musicians that came around and asked if you would like them to play the table a song - which similarly happens in Italy. Very charming.",

    "text": "I am giving what would have been a zero star review 4 stars ONLY because of the excellent service provided by manager Kristie Miller. As locals, our group of 4 was well aware that we would need reservations for a busy Saturday night.  When we called at about 5pm to make reservations we were told \"we can get you in now or at 9pm.\" We immediately went on open table and booked a reservation for 6:30pm. So, clearly, the hostess stand and open table seem to have some miscommunication.  Once we arrived we were escorted to our patio table but another couple cut in front of us and took our seats. Our host went over to talk to them and came back with his apologies and confusion.  He said \"they did have reservations as well but just sat themselves.\" While the appropriate action would have been to tell them they must be escorted and seated by a host, they just let them have their way. Fine, we didn't want to make an issue of it and just wanted to get on with our evening. We were then sat at another patio table that was filthy with food remnants and bird feces. We let the host know immediately and he said someone would be by shortly. After about 5 minutes of sitting there at our wobbly table (we looked underneath and it was being held on with electrical tape!!!) we'd had enough! One of our party went to address our issues and horrible experience thus far and were promptly seated at a different patio table by Kristie Miller. She was apologetic and friendly. Our server Gary was very fun and attentive. The chef even came out to discuss a special request one of our party had placed. Thank you all for making what started out as a zero-star experience a pleasant evening. Kudos to Kristie for turning this one around!",

    "text": "Maggiano's is a nice place to go to when guest are in town. It is a step above Olive Garden, but not as costly as Rao's. There is always a line, so that is a good sign that they are doing something right.  It has been more than two years since I have been able to get back to this Italian restaurant. I wanted to see if it is as good as I remembered. When a friend came into town, it was the perfect opportunity to visit. The wait was estimated for 30-45 minutes, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. They make a skinny sangria that tastes like fruit punch. It is lethal and easy to knock back. My friend ordered the frozen peach bellini and it tasted like a smoothie. Most of the drinks cost around 8-10 dollars. Not bad for being on the strip.  When we were sat, the server promptly greeted us and filled our water glasses. The service was impeccable. She was friendly, attentive, and non intrusive.   We had ordered the calamari appetizer to give us some time to decide on our entree. Apparently it took some time to come out, but we did not notice. Caught up in our conversation and snacking on the bread made time go by quickly.   Our waitress gave some great suggestions and I decided on a dish that would help the Make-a-Wish foundation. Right now, they have a few specialty items that Maggiano's will donate a portion of the proceeds to the charity. The roasted chicken farfalle is delicious. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente, the chicken moist, generous amounts of spinach, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, topped with parm slivers. The broth like sauce at the bottom made the dish light. I was happy that I could get something that was not cream based and not have to settle for marinara. My friend had ordered the chicken pesto pasta and it was good. You must love basil and pesto to get this meal because it is bold. I would order it again.   Overall this was a nice meal. I would not hesitate to go back, but next time I will skimp on the bread to save some room for dessert.",

A friend of ours made dinner reservations for Sat evening by the window and within 10 mins of arrival, we were seated right above The Strip facing the Wynn. My recommendation is to bring 3 friends so you can order the \"Family Style\" meal on the back of the menu. There are three price points and we chose the $30.95/PP. You choose and everyone shares 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pasta dishes, 2 entrees, and 2 deserts. And if you want more, just ask. It is AYCE. :)  My rating is for the \"Family Style\" experience.",

My wife referred to her pasta as \"perfectly cooked\". It's tough to please her, so that  means something! The margarita flatbread was AMAZING. Hands down the best food of our entire Vegas vacation.  The service was great. Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. He came with what we needed, asked if we needed anything, and was off. I like that. Now, I need to say something special about the service. The table next to us was very rude to our waiter over how the sauce was presented - not prepared, just presented. He handled it very well, as did the manager.  Little tip: make a reservation. Otherwise you'll be waiting longer than you'd like.",

Despite this minor inconvenience, we were welcomed by the bartender and directed to a 4-top table.  Waters and cocktails were ordered to battle the slight hangover from previous eve's shenanigans.  The menu is varied but not overdone offering traditional Italian meals. The 4 of us places our orders. I went for the chicken parm sandwich. All our food arrived at once, hot and fresh.  My sandwich was good - nicely seasoned! My dining companions commented similarly regarding their meals.  Maggianos opens on to the mall for post-meal shopping and to walk off a good meal!",

This is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  Be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  Ask for a table next to the window with view of LVBlvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners.",

    "text": "So I came here with a bunch of friends as our first group meal for a bachelor party weekend on a Friday night. We were all starving to be honest and this place had been set up as our go to stop. We received a number of pre-ordered dishes family style that were already included in our costs so I am not sure what the breakdown was, but it was AYCE and we definitely enjoyed the grub.  We had about 30 guys and took over a gigantic table next to a bachelorette and her party and a bunch of normal patrons. We had multiple courses and the food came out hot and tasty and in portions big enough for our entire table to get enough to eat at once...  Pro Tip: Call ahead and get a reservation. A number of people had to wait quite a while in order to get seated who didnt.  The food was all decent to tasty and the chicken and pasta dish stuck out as the best to me. It had some type of a white (creme?) sauce with it. The dinner also included appetizers and dessert. It's a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffet's.    The one thing I will add is that the service is not exactly the best. It took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills (soda, tea, beer, etc). It was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter. It just seemed to take an inexorably long time.  Overall it was worth it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group. It is hard to say for sure.",

I usually go get it at their to go counter in the back, and they have seats. Sure, the wait time is a little long and sometimes, I have to ask around for a to go person. And I'm not gonna lie, the first time I got lost, but overall, I know where to go now. Seeing how I'm moving back to Las Vegas, I'm going to try to abstain going here as much just so I don't get fat!  The slice itself in to go always seems to make me happy that I get it. They put the slice on chocolate sauce and it seems to be garnished so nicely. Though, I think I'm only going to order at the to go counter, seeing that the last time I order it at the bar, they kind of just got the slice and didn't really do much with it. Still tasted great, but I actually do enjoy how they garnish it.  Putting all of that aside. The restaurant and its food is just as splendid altogether. I've eaten there with a friend and they give a great size in portions. Don't remember what I ordered, but then again, it's pasta~! I felt full and happy afterwards!  I like it here. I hope it stays for a very long time, despite renovations at the mall! Thanks guys~",

I made the reservation for 6:30pm on a Friday and I drove 15 minutes.   I literally walked in and sat down.  Bypassed a line and they were packed.  I love this application!   WHERE TO PARK:  There is complimentary valet parking at Forever 21 on Fashion Show drive.  There is an elevator that takes you to the back of the restaurant.   Located above the Las Vegas Strip it has a great view and ambiance.   I ordered a bowl of Creamy Tomato Basil Soup which was devine.  The bread complimented the meal but I was disappointed I wasn't offered Italian dipping sauce (Italian butter by a different name).  I love olive oil, vinegar and spices to dip my bread in.  I had a large Grilled Chicken Caprese salad as my entree and asked to substitute spinach for the mixed greens.   Off the menu:  Fresh Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Cucumbers,Kalamata Olives, Red Onions, Garlic Croutons & White Balsamic Vinaigrette.  I like that the cucumbers and chicken were diced up, perfect mouthfuls.   I could barely taste the mozzarella cheese even though they were large bites.  I would recommend a stronger cheese that can overcome the dressing and stand out on its own.  The olives were pitted and I really appreciate that.   I topped off the meal with a hot Cappuccino. My waiter, Rafael E.,  was very attentive,  pleasant and visited me often.  My water glass was never empty and there were no broken dishes.",

    "text": "Wow...not my first visit and not my last. I am a Vegas local and we still go to the strip to exclusively dine at Maggianos. Yesterday we went for lunch for Fathers Day. Our server was Mac and he was fabulous! His energy, attitude, and professionalism were wonderful. I have a horrendous shellfish allergy. Mac and who seemed to be the manager were on top of it and it meant the world to me! Now on to the food...the Caprese salad is just scrumptious! The balsamic vinaigrette was so sweet and hearty so the light drizzle was perfect! The mozz and tomatoes were cut with equal thickness...so each bite had the right ratio of decadent cheese, fresh tomato, sweet and savory balsamic with a pinch of fresh basil. I had the chicken piccata and holy moly it is just delectable. I am typically not a fan of Capers but you could put just about anything on this entree and it would magically make it yummy. The chicken is thin and has just right texture and plumpness to soak up the magnificent sauce. I also had the four cheese ravioli with pesto sauce and it was so delicious. They do put a small amount of red sauce over the top. In the future I would ask them to either hold that sauce or put it on the side. I found the white pesto sauce was more than enough. My daughter had the macaroni and cheese and for a two-and-a-half-year-old it truly fit the bill! My husband had the chicken parmesan and left a very happy man! The bread we first received was very warm and they had the right amount of accoutrement on the table to make a fun dipping plate. My husband used the fresh olive oil, added red pepper flakes, and fresh parmesan to dip his bread. We would recommend this to any family for any occasion big or small. The prices are beyond reasonable for the ambiance, the taste of the food, and the portion sizes. What a wonderful way to celebrate Father's Day. Thank you Mac for making it worry-free",

I was really disappointed by the taste, and the texture of the lamb and the salmon. I wondered the freshness of this fish and meat. Additionally, along with the lamb, came some mashed potatoes that had literally no taste.   My review, in other words; the chef has a lot of room for improvement!!",

We didn't make a reservation so there was a 25 minute wait which was fine, so we sat in their seating area and someone came over to us maybe 5 minutes after and asked if we wanted bread and waters, and if we wanted a server, which was awesome! I've never been to a place that accommodating. The bread and waters came out quickly, as did our wines and dinner. We ordered the filet, tomato caprese, the side of spaghetti agoli and the beef medallions. All were excellent, I sort of wish they served bread with the tomato caprese, but they always ask if you want more bread so it was no problem getting some with it. If we come back to visit here we are definitely coming here again.",

The service here was okay, our server was nice, but as with most restaurants on the strip...when we have declined drinks it seems as though the service declines along with that.   The reason for the low review, however, is because the food is just not good. I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo and I make better alfredo sauce at home, and can buy better alfredo sauce in a jar, off the self, at my local grocery store. My husband ordered the mushroom ravioli, and he loves mushrooms and I hate them, so he rarely gets to eat them, and he still hated this meal. The alfredo is thin, and tastes very salty. There is no body of flavor in this sauce, I cannot taste any garlic or cheese for that matter. Just really lacking.   The one thing I did really like about this restaurant is that they have make a wish stars on each table. Beyond that, I really was not impressed.",

When we walked in without reservations, the girls at the front were not the most friendly. (Unusual we thought since we called ahead and they said not necessary since it was only us 2.) We finally were seated in a great booth. Renan was our server. Because of my allergies he had the chef come out and talk to us just to make sure. After some good suggestion, we decided on calamari to start, Frutti d'mar and Salmon Oscar. Wow it was so amazing. The portion were so huge we couldn't finish it.  But even though the food was amazing, Renan made our first visit here incredible. His friendly and excellent service pushed our visit to the best Italian food we have ever eaten. (That despite traveling to Italy and having great food there too.) So if you are having a craving for amazing Italian food, hurry here.  You will love it like we did.",

The place was crowded, but that was not so much of an issue. The noise level in the restaurant was pretty high, but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip.  We ordered the steamed mussels and crab cakes for appetizer. The grilled salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes.  Kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball.  - Crab cakes were okay, the sauce that comes with it is nice - Mussels in red sauce (Diablo if I remember well). When served they smelled funny. My first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them. Some spaghetti strings were visible, so I was wondering where the sauce really came from?! But, that was not the problem; the smell was just unbearable that I could not eat these mussels. Returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled. Manager came and offered us another dish, we ordered the fried calamari ... and it was okay. - Salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes; the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach. Not very appetizing to see, I like grilled fish to remain dry when served. The potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside ... they were left to roast just beyond what they needed. - Flat bread pizza, not too bad for a kids meal - Spaghetti with giant meatball; I am not sure what people like about \"giant\" food, but for me it looks disgusting.   We were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari, which is great customer service.   Overall, maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food.",

Service is always good and their family style menu is pretty decent too with 3 different levels to choose from.  The wine list is pretty limited but has some nice selections.  I came here the other night with my married couple friends and their daughter.  Nice date, too bad she's 32 years younger than me!  This night I had the fried zucchini for an appetizer.  I would have never ordered this since I a) don't eat fried food and b) don't care for zucchini.  The waiter said it was a big hit and he was right, it was really good.  My entree was the baked ziti which was prepared quite nice with Italian sausage and just the right amount of baked on cheese.  The portion size was perfect.  For desert we got the 10 dollar sampler which you would expect to be too small for 4 people...it had about 5 different deserts and all were very good.  Negatives:  very busy, and no cannoli's. What self respecting Italian joint doesn't have home made cannoli's? Oh well...",

Great dishes, you cant go wrong with anything (except for maybe the Lobster ravioli, you only get 4!).  HUUUUGE helpings so you'll definitely have some left to take home.  Lasagna is great, spaghetti and meatballs were outta sight (i'm a picky meatball kinda gal), and the tiramisu knocked it outta the park.    Thank god they have one in Costa Mesa, CA - although a trip to Vegas would not be complete without stopping here.  PS - Make reservations.  Wait time is long but worth it.",

    "text": "The pasta for the price at Maggiano's just can't be beat!  I went with my Mom and her sister and my bf (Chris L.) last week while in Vegas.  I shared the gnocchi and meat lasagna with Chris L. and my Mom and aunt shared the corn pasta with shrimp.  The corn pasta was a must for them because they are both on a gluten-free diet so regular wheat pasta just doesn't cut it.  I love that a serious Italian restaurant cares about the wheat-free side of life and offers wheat-free options.  I also love that a serious Italian restaurant can taste this good and not break the bank.  The wine list is great and the desserts were pretty good--I got the profiterole with ice cream and chocolate sauce and the dessert would've been divine if it weren't for the profiterole....  The two baby boomers at the table each got the (GF) creme brulee and loved it.  So, for what Maggiano's is, I'm giving it 5 stars.  It certainly beats the other \"cheap\" food of Vegas and the price is so much better than the expensive restaurants there.  That's a win-win in my book.",

    "text": "For finer dining in Las Vegas, my wife and I typically like going to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris, which is excellent. Of course, we can't possibly eat there all the time, so during our last Las Vegas trip we also tried Maggiano's Little Italy. I understand this is a national chain (one which I wasn't aware of at all up until now), but if you didn't know that you would assume this was a single independently owned restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice, but not pretentious. Service was rapid and very personable. Like many Italian restaurants, especially on the strip in Vegas, this place is fairly expensive, but if you do not go crazy on drinks and appetizers there are several reasonably priced entrees on the menu. Our bill with tip was under $35, which is very reasonable for the large portions we received, as well as the quality of food and service we experienced. We experienced no real negatives, and the view outside of the Vegas strip while we were dining indoors was spectacular. They also have outdoor seating, though it is limited in the number of available tables. One minor complaint is that they could turn down the air conditioning a notch, but that is a common complaint anywhere indoors in Vegas, not limited solely to this restaurant. We've experienced much colder air conditioning elsewhere in Vegas. They also did not serve butter with there bread, but brought us some butter promptly when we asked for it. Their to-go boxes are of high quality and very usable aluminum. Portion sizes were large enough for us to have leftovers we ended up taking with us on our flight back home. My daughter ended up eating that, and she was very impressed - even though the food had just been reheated in a microwave, instead of more properly in an oven. For the price, this is a well located and enjoyable Italian restaurant. It is well worth checking out in comparison to some of the more outrageously priced (for Arab sheiks?) Italian restaurants on the strip.",

It makes the underground parking difficult to access. Consider using the valet.   Service: Our server was very nice but she also presented the olive oil/balsamic vinegar plate in front of my four year old. It was a very messy spill.   Food: Pretty good overall. The fried zucchini appetizer is always good. My friends chicken salad looked fine and my pepperoni flat bread was not interesting in the slightest.

Bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. We started with an appetizer of tomato caprese that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the spinach salad that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the chicken parmesan that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. In total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which I thought was very reasonable. The sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. There was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. Overall I liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service.

The highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful. There was a spinach salad that tasted like a party in my mouth, with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits. The entrees were equally gratifying, my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach (cooked to absolute perfection) and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce. The Chicken Parmesan was also a front runner, the chicken breasts were pounded so thin, yet still juicy and moist.   I will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall!!!",

Maggiano's was one of my favorite meals in Las Vegas, because they just made everything easy. First of all, being in a non-smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. We got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants.   It is a chain, but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees, Chicken Pesto Linguine and Chicken Francese ($11 - 13), were excellent. One of my favorite things to eat in Italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil, but it is hard to find in the U.S. I was thrilled when it came as a side to the Chicken Francese and it brought back so many wonderful memories.   From our arrival through the end of service, the staff was professional, prompt and courteous. Portion size was hearty, especially the pasta dish, so we even skipped dinner that night. Not the most exciting choice in town, but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air, sweet, sweet fresh air.",

But the food is good and you can easily splurge on the wine or drinks, and still save a ton over the big name places, eg. Batali's B&B, etc.",

The noodles were fresh and the chicken was buttery. My companion had the Shrimp Diavolo. It was perfectly spicy and the shrimp was plentiful and plump. The salad was flavorful, excellent. The atmosphere was a perfect mix of casual, not so much formal. The wait staff was impressive and our table had a lovely view of the Las Vegas Strip. I would highly recommend and I will visit there again when I come back to Vegas.",

Dinner was eggplant parmesan, salmon, chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent.  One of our diners had some dietary issues and they were VERY attentive to her.

The bread was not so good but our server was really nice and what he recommended was really yummy. Their Rigatoni D was good and their chicken santi something. My bf enjoyed the calamari and it said it was crunchy and not fishy. My favorite of the whole meal was the cheesecake and vera's lemon cookies. You have got to try these lemon cookies they are sooooo good!!! Prices were $11-$18 for entrees. Only thing I didn't like was the glass of wine I had. I think they didn't put the cork in enough in the bottle so it had a bland taste or they left it too long to open up.  PROS: Food, outside patio, service, lemon cookies CONS: WIne been opened for too long",

Some days there is a violinist strolling around playing requests. Try the calamari and Maggiano's salad to begin with, stuffed mushrooms aren't bad either. Traditional fare is great, lasagna and angel hair pasta with Arrabiata sauce. Finish with tiramisu and a moscato, delicious.",

And yes, I had a pretty awesome experience here even though I would have preferred to dine at a Michelin starred or famous celebrity chef's restaurant here in LV.  I joined some of my old colleagues from my previous job here for dinner during the Interop convention. We had a driver take us from our hotel to this restaurant so there was obviously NO parking problem. :)  We had a table reserved for about 6 of us and we were seated promptly. The place was JAMPACKED for a weeknight. But everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and their service. It can definitely get pretty damn loud here.  We ordered tons of different pasta, chicken, seafood and dessert dishes. Everything served family style of course. Everything that came out tasted wonderful. I honestly didn't wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives I was dining with so I kept my portions on my plate pretty small. But when dessert came out...I opted to eat my full slice of cheesecake all to myself AND of course nibble on some of the other dessert plates that were still sitting there in the middle of our table.  Our waiter/waitresses were all very friendly. And service was quite efficient.  Would I dine at this particular Maggiano's again? Hmmm, well I have about a million bookmarked spots to try out, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon just due to the fact that I already know it's standard Italian food. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's not that adventurous with other types of food and just want to enjoy their night with a hearty dinner at a well-known chain restaurant.",

He made reservations for two and when we got there, the table was ready and they were waiting for us! They had us sat at such a beautiful spot next to the window in front of the Wynn Hotel (which is always a sight to see!)   We were immediately treated with bread and balsamic vinegar which was very good! The bread was warm and soft and they kept coming with them! And the balsamic vinegar was also so tasty! We ordered our food and did not wait more then 20/ 25 mins. But we enjoyed it because they had a man walking around playing the violin very beautifuly. We loved it. When we got our dinner it was very delicious and the portions were great! The price was also very reasonable for a restaurant on the strip! They had $14 plate all the way up to $25 dishes. But they had all the Italian classics and many seafood dishes (which was what my boyfriend had, and said it was great!)  I highly recomend this restaurant for people who need a good warm meal in a great, soothing atmosphere!   The only reason why I gave Maggiano's Little Italy 3 stars was because towards the end of our meal the waiter was standing (not very far from our table) staring us down, waiting for us to finish up and leave. I found it a little rude and uncomfortable, but other then those last 10 mins it was a great experience.",

The interior appears very clean. Came here for dinner the other night to meet up with a friend at 7pm but hadn't called to make a reservation. My boy and I got there a little early so we put our name down (wait was 30 mins, nbd) and took a seat at the bar. The bartender took a minute to get to us but was friendly and made an AWESOME drink for me. Moscato Mojito. Definitely try it!!  Within 10 minutes, our buzzer went off for our table. I brought it over with my still nearly full drank-drank but had to wait like 10 more minutes at the stand to be seated. I get that it was much faster than the 30 minute prediction... But don't tell me my table is ready then make me wait again while with a drink in hand. Whatev.   We were seated, our server said he'd be right with us. Our server came back and took our drink order. We ordered 3 of those moscato mojitos (one extra for our late friend lol). I'm telling you! Try it!!! Our friend showed up shortly after and we got our drank-dranks. Server asked if we'd decided on our meals yet... Our friend just sat down.... Give us like 2 more minutes? Ok cool! He came back like 15 minutes later. With bread and oil. We ordered and asked for vinegar to go with the oil. He never brought it....  Meanwhile the table next to us had sat down 5 minutes after us and was being served their food. Again, I get that we were taking our time and our friend was late, WHATEV. But their server was ON IT. I was able to get his attention and asked for vinegar. It took him 12 seconds. I was so jealous of the table next to us.   Food finally came like 30 minutes later and I was a little disappointed with the size of the salad that my boy and I agreed to share because it was \"enough for two\"... Maybe enough for two kids. My ravioli and side of broccolini were really good tho. Our server came back 10 minutes later to ask if we needed anything. I was gonna get a dessert but after waiting forever for our meal and having never gotten vinegar from him, I decided to pass fearing it would take too long. Just the check thanks! Ugh. That was another 10 minute ordeal. I don't recall him thanking us or looking forward to our next visit but that may have been said...  Overall, 3 stars only cuz our service was slow and spotty. Memorable I suppose but not for the right reasons. Food was good. Nothing to write home about but satisfying. Dranks were BOMB. I'll go back just for that Moscato Mojito! Better luck next time though, Maggiano's.",

A girlfriend of mine was married across the street at the Wynn and had her reception here so I was already familiar with their cuisine, boyfriend didn't know what to expect considering he thinks Olive Garden is real Italian  Boy was he pleasantly surprised, he is still raving about it!!! Had a beautiful view while we enjoyed our meal and I received a lovely serenade from a nice little man with a guitar who works there... he sang Nat King Cole's \"unforgettable\" I definitely won't forget this experience and will be back  highly recommend for a special occasion or a nice evening out",

    "text": "Wow that was really good. Sometimes you just need some delicious handmade Italian food.   Tonight we ordered chicken parmesan, veal piccata, and the grilled salmon salad (mine). Everything was cooked perfectly and everyone left stuffed and happy.   I ordered the grilled salmon salad which had lots of leafy greens, red onion, croutons, tomatoes, snap peas, and peperoncinos. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was a good sized piece of fish. I got the dressing on the side as I like salads a little more dry and the dressing itself was so good. Not too sweet, like some honey mustards are, but the perfect amount of sweet and savory. The dish filled me up and I would definitely order it again.   I also got to try the seasonal sangria and it was citrus-y and sweet and incredibly enjoyable.   The staff are all polite and know the menu well. I'd recommend getting a table by the window or outside as it's a good place to look out onto the strip and people watch.   Overall we enjoyed our experience here and we're looking forward to going back in the future. It's a great place to get some Italian food whether you're local or visiting in town.",

The hostess said the reservation I made was for the next day- but I had an email and confirmation number from Open Table. It was for the day and time we arrived there. She was very unhelpful- we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. We had a party of 5, with 2 kids and a teen- they were hungry. They sat us down at a cramped table- we asked for a booth and got one. The server was horrendous. Kept forgetting things and after we ordered and the kids were so hungry- we asked for more bread and the server said \"only one more basket.\" WTF?! This really upset me. I've never in my life heard of  this BS! The food was so/so but the server and the initial experience terrible.   My husband has gotten work events catered by Maggiano's and the kids and I had never been. Was really looking forward to trying it. Nope! Not good and above all the service was appalling!!!",

When we walked in, I expected to be met with resistance due to our reservations not working in their system, but they quickly worked us into a table as we had a show to make, and the waiter, Rafael, made sure he would have us served without leaving us in an anxious rush. He was quite courteous and refilled our bread and water while checking on us ever so often.   I ordered a Manhattan clam chowder as an appetizer, a seafood linguine as an entree, and a sampler tiramisu for the dessert. If you are hungry, then this is the place for you because they are strong with their portions. The pricing is very fair for a decently fancy place. My entree was piled to the top with lobster, clams, and muscles; I actually wasn't able to finish all of it. This was the first time I've had Manhattan clam chowder which is a red tomato soup base instead of a white, and I enjoyed it very much. Everything was cooked to perfection on my plate, and the tiramisu dessert was also delicious.   I would recommend this place highly for their customer service and food. They seem very flexible. If you're looking for an Italian place to eat at in Vegas tonight. I would highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "We wanted a Non-casino Restaurant Lunch and since we were across from The Wynn, it was convenient.  When ordering my husband asked if the portions were big (he's got a big appetite) and the waiter said not really. However, the portion is huge!! So, be prepared to eat if you order one of their pasta dishes.  My lunch wasn't so great. I orderd the Crab Cake Sandwich which was salty and soggy. The chips that accompanied were stale and overly salty. I had desperatly wished I had stuck to what they know. . .pasta.  The service was slow and to top it off, I ordered a side salad with my sandwich for an extra $2.25 but they charged us for a normal side salad with out an entree. . .$4.50. Now, Its only $2 and I don't want the hassel of getting it  back, but what if everyone was getting charged incorrectly by the same waiter? No Bueno!  So, I said something and the Manager said he'd take care of it. We waited over 20 minutes for $2 and I was regretting my decision as I munched on the mints in the Host area.  When the Manager re-appeared, he comped our lunch because he made us wait so long!  So, I have to say, I will definately visit the one in Santana Row in San Jose, CA just for that. At least I know to stick to the pasta!",

For the pasta dish, it was bland because they forgot the sauce that was supposed to come with it. It was too late to bring it back since I was already at my hotel room when I found out.  Oh well.  As for the meat dish, it was really good. It was extremely moist and melts in your mouth. I would definitely order that again. I think I would have to try this place again to give it a fair review.",

    "text": "I had never been here, but we were doing a combo bachelorette/birthday and this place was awesome.  One waitress was pissed because we were taking a lot of pictures and standing in her way!  OOOOHHHH I'm SCARED - she kept giving us mean looks but WHATEVS.  Getting a group of females together to decided on 2 entrees, 2 salads, 2 apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard.  Someone has to take control!  I ordered a Reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show.  With large parties, the restaurant STRONGLY \"suggests\" ok forces you to have family style, which is FINE by me.  It actually works to your advantage because then you aren't squabling over the damn check.  Of course we had one in our party that was a squabbler and a little bit of a pouty puss and was mad when she didn't get her own way.  Well OKAYYYYYY.  So we finally decided on the chopped salad and spiniach salad and the bride is Jewish so we asked for bacon/pork on the side, which was no problem.  The brushetti was awesome, the bread great and the spinach dip was ok, kinda like the frozen kind, just ok.  The ravioli was great!  The waiter even brought me and another girl a sample (large sample) of the pesto with chicken and it was my FAV - we both wanted to order it for the entree, but because of the family style, we couldn't.  Two people wanted to order off the ala carte menu, which they said was fine, as long as at least 6 wanted family style - that built in gratuity is a blessing because at the end of the meal, which was $22.50 per person, I ended up putting in $35 which covered my dinner, wine, tax and tip - couldn't beat it with a stick.  The food is 10000000000 times better than stinky old Buca di Pepto Bismal!!  I highly recommend this place and I'm a picky eater.  LOVE IT",

I gave it three stars because the Caesar side salad was a generous portion and fresh. My husband ordered a veal plate and it wasn't up to par. The veal was a little on the hard side. He's had veal in our home town and you can actually cut it with a fork, also his pasta was on the cold side. My shrimp scampi was also lacking flavor. A little garlic would have made the dish a whole lot better. The shrimp were a little on the tough side, and no fresh shrimp flavor. It kind of tasted like boiled shrimp that was reheated for this hot dish. We definitely won't visit this one again.",

    "text": "Went here for work lunch. For easy parking we went to park at the Neiman Marcus side and take the elevator up. You would have to walk outside at the strip but the weather in October is perfect for a walk. If you want a shorter walk, there is a parking at the back thru the road between Trump Tower and Fashion Show Mall.   Maggiano is located on the 3rd floor of the mall. You have option of dining inside or outside. There is a separate bar section if you just want to have some drinks. You can opt to eat at the bar as well.   Their lunch service was pretty quick. Our food came in within 15 mins. Our server was terrific, polite, knowledgable about the menu and the special of the day (she mentioned the $5 mimosa).   For appetizer, we had crispy calamari (I love calamari and this place has a great one). Next was a big plate of toothsome chopped salad with bacon and avocado! Anything with bacon is indeed delicious! And this one was no exception. Yumm. For the main entree I had shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. Generous portion of shrimps! The pasta was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was a little bland than the usual.   Between the bread, appetizer, salad and entree, I was so full. So no desert today.   Great spot for lunch! And will come back to try their Brunch on the weekend!",

We had Spaghetti Aioli, Steak and Shrimp Pasta, as appetizer we had Bruschetta and steamed mushrooms. With a nice bottle of Pino.  One minor comment is that seating is only done, if the party is complete - even with reservation. So if you invite several guest coming from different locations their arrival time will be all different, and you will not get your table until all arrived.  Tip - divert your guest to the bar for drinks during the wait time.  I will be coming back.",

    "text": "Thanksgiving feast for those that are in Vegas on Thanksgiving Day! Maggiano's kept the Thanksgiving tradition of turkey and ham while leaving their signature Italian dishes within their prix fixe meals. To taste, the food was good but did it beat the home cooked meals? I still prefer home, but this works (especially when in Vegas!). Prix fixe approximately $50/person. All dishes came in family style. Had plenty of leftovers, but in Vegas, where would one keep the leftovers unless you're staying in a place with a fridge? For the price, it was a very nice dinner. Here's our choices:   Turkey, stuffing, gravy- typical dish. Turkey was tender! For having to serve a packed house, we were surprised they kept the juiciness of each turkey slice. Not enough gravy though. Cranberry sauce was very sour, so I skipped out on that sauce.   Gnocchi, sausage- Definitely surprised gnocchi was soft and chewy! A bit bland though.   Caesar salad- typical. Enough dressing. Good!  Maggiano's salad- yum! Bits of bacon and signature vinaigrette (sort of a light Italian dressing) was great! Could enjoy that next time we go back.   Tilapia on spinach bed- don't remember what sauce it was. Maybe white wine with cream. It was good, but again, a bit bland.   Mashed sweet potato- bland!!! No sweetness at all. Hated this side.   Creamed corn- bland too! Sides were failures.   Chocolate cake- rich in flavor! Beats the bland food. Be sure to ask for coffee or hot tea or hot water.   Pumpkin cheesecake- typical. Was good but nothing amazing to say.   Customer service- quick with the meals! Didn't waste any time getting us our food. Thank goodness! We were hungry! Only suggestion would be to offer coffee, tea, or hot water before serving dessert. Server offered this after we were done with our dessert. Even when the other servers brought the desserts, we didn't see our main server. We still enjoyed family time though.",

They had outdoor seating which we decided to wait for. We put our names down and went to grab a drink at the bar until our table was called around 8 pm on a Saturday night. She said it should only be about 15 minutes since we were next. After about 30 mins I went to go check. I saw an empty table and asked her about it. She said they just had to clean it. 10 minutes go by and it's still not cleaned!! After another 5 minutes they finally cleaned it and got us seated. Why does it take 15 minutes to clean an empty table?!? We finally got seated and the waiter was very nice. We asked for bread with pesto which pesto was not on the menu but he had the chef whip it up and didn't even charge us. I got the lobster Carbonara and it was so good! It was $30 for the plate but portion was very big. I split my plate with a friend and it was just enough food. My friend got the veal with lemon sauce. The veal was good but the sauce was terrible. The waiter was kind enough to take it off the check for her. Great restaurant and great food. Took a star off for long wait time to clean an empty table and a star off for the terrible lemon wine sauce with the veal dish.",

Every single staff member, from every single location I have been to have all been friendly and accomodating.   This is an excellent choice for casual drinks, group dining and wonderful for the family - even with little babes.  I have now been to this location for a total fo 5 times in the past 12 years, and as it was then, it continues a great tradition of good food and service.  Twice I have been here for large group, 20+ dinners, and it is one of the easiest group dinners to assemble due to their hefty and incredibly well-priced family-style option. Parking is easy, which is also a great plus.",

We had the calamari,  filet mignon and asparagus risotto, and ceasar salad,  and filet mignon and asparagus for veggies.",

We also shared the chopped salad for $6.99 and the bruschutto tour for $12.99. One appetizer, one salad and one entree for two of us (they also served the BEST bread) and we still came home with leftovers. We're definitely going back!",

The menu has the same variety as you'd expect in another Italian restaurant: salad, pasta, pizza, etc. now here are my recommendations/compliments:  Their eggplant Parmesan is something I would definitely recommend. It's one of their less salty dishes. Their og for me is their spaghetti and meatballs. Their service is amazing in my opinion.  Now for the criticism. As I've mentioned, their food can be a bit salty. Now the reason I put that hey have great service is because you can ask for less salt and that's what they'll give you. For me, that's proof that they are adaptable. Their chicken parm was a little tough, but other than that this place is amazing.",

The food was standard Italian, nothing overly special, but well done overall. What made the experience was our server, Nicole. She was very uplifting, seemed to like her job, was extremely busy but handled it with the greatest of ease. She also recognized we'd probably be drinking more Diet Coke then the average jackass, so she brought a pitcher to handle our bad habits. It's truly uplifting how average food can be taken to another level due to great service! We would definitely go back, and would ask for Nicole first and foremost, hopefully another restaurant doesn't steal here!!!",

Talk about HEARTY! I have quite the appetite and I stayed full for 12 hours. It was a delicious dish if you're looking for good spaghetti.   Although I love a lot of different foods, I don't eat any cheese at all. So that limits my choices at Italian restaurants. Regardless, I was very happy with what I had.   They were very accommodating of my wife who required gluten free. They even sent the chef out to speak with her about any other allergies she may have to make sure they got it correct. Kudos to them for that!  The server was great, the food runner was very nice (came out on a separate occasion from the chef to advise that the meatball is prepared with flour so the wife should refrain from eating it) , and the chef as I previously mentioned.   Great location, great atmosphere, delicious food.",

The appetizers were good, but the Calamari was way to typical, heavily breaded and just blah. For the entries, the Gnocchi and Cioppino were great, the Veal Parmigiana was out of this world.

Drinks - ordered a Bellini that was served kind of warm, for a sparkling wine. I figure service bar was busy, so we got the wine that sits out for a bit, no biggie wine is wine. Food flavor and presentation, was lacking. Calamari was whatever. Nothing exceptional or different. After it took 30 minutes to get to us, we were starving at that point. Got the Gnocchi Bolognese- I had to return it, as I genuinely thought they accidentally doused it in salt. If the salt wasn't a mistake the dish, you can tell, would be delicious. The actual gnocchi was fresh. Took 20 minutes from calamari hit to get our food, which is normal for a busy night. Boyfriend got the chicken parm, which was great. Lots of flavor. Nothing really wow'd me. Something kind of irked me, a server dropped off a beer by accident (we said it's not ours, that we only ordered one) but he said \"oh well, it's on us\" and then it was on the bill at the end of the night lol. We didn't say anything, because whatever at that point. Manager never stopped by, which is weird for a send back, but they did comp the meal I didn't eat. All and all we won't be back, but we recommend for the service, not the food.",

Italian sausage flatbread... delicious!! I need that as a large size pizza. Crust thin & crisp all the ingredients held up on their own without compromising the crust. Perfect! Steamed mussles. Nice, fresh, plump mussles mixed with white beans, gave them an added creamy touch! Yes!  The third app were the stuffed mushrooms. They were good, but was missing something in the stuffing, maybe some sort of cheese...the spinach and bread crumbs were more mushy and added nothing to the mushrooms.  It was nice to sit out on the patio and watch the rest of the runners cross the finish line.  When in Vegas I will definitely consider this a place to come back and grab a drink or a bite to eat.",

    "text": "After a long hard day of shopping, I wandered upstairs to a restaurant called Maggiano's.  I am so happy I did!  The restaurant itself sounded familiar but I knew I had never dined there before.    Our server Daniel was very attentive and personable, it was my first visit to Las Vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time.  This restaurant had a great view.  You could see Las Vegas Blvd, people shopping, or other diners just like me.  Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at Maggiano's and we were definitely enjoying ourselves!  We started our dining experience with the Bruschetta.  It was definitely some of the best bruschetta I have ever had.  I make a pretty killer bruschetta and I was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta.  Splendido!!  The bruschetta was served on Italian Garlic Bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic.  We also ordered: the Chopped Salad, the Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup, and the Fettuccine Alfredo.  The Chopped Salad was very good.  I ordered it without green onions.  The salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing.  Most of the items on the menu, they give you the option to order half or the full portion.  Believe me when I say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing.  I ordered the whole chopped salad and it was really big.  The Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup contained italian sausage, fennel, white beans and tomatoes.  It was really tasty.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was delicious!  It was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce.  We only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large.  Overall my experience at Maggiano's was great from start to finish.  Our waters were never left empty, and our server was always around if we needed anything.  It seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldn't ask the server for.  If you around the Fashion Show Mall and you spot Maggiano's on the 2nd floor, you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because I assure you it will be worth it.  I will definitely wander back into a Maggiano's even if its not in Las Vegas.  Cheers and Enjoy!",

They let us know that all the food is made from scratch which I thought was good. I did call ahead and made a reservation which came in handy because it looked like they got busy. I also let them know in advance it was my friends birthday and at the end of the meal they brought him a little desert with a candle which I thought was really nice.

But the entrees were Olive Garden worthy at best (I've only been to Olive Garden once, but that's how I remember it), gluttonous servings with extra sauce or garlic butter, trying to please the American palate, in my opinion, instead of authentic Italian, which I believe is simple fresh quality ingredients made with care.  Now the price for the place is pretty reasonable, especially for being on the strip, so maybe heading over for happy hour, 3-6 pm, would be a better experience, the bartender seemed to know what he was doing, but as for dinner I would pass",

This restaurant certainly does this and more...especially the part where the dinner tab sticker shock comes into play.  You won't get that here.  Noel our server was money!  With a sense of urgency he made my petite, red headed passion flower and I aware the Happy Hour was in full swing for just a short period of time.  With this very subtle hint we ordered the Coppla Rosso and Chardonnay by the glass.  These wines complimented our meals very nicely.   I ordered the Rigatoni  D.  This came with pasta, herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms and caramelized onions, tossed in a Marsala cream sauce.  Very generous portion.  Awesome!  My PRHPF ordered the Baked Ziti and pronounced it to be very good!  For what we had in mind for an Italian dinner this exceeded our expectations.  For desert we kept it pretty low key..Italian lemon cookies were perfect.  There was no way we were gonna be able to enjoy desert properly as we were stuffed.  This very nice wedding anniversary dinner was over the top because our server Noel was polished and engaging at every moment.  Easy to talk to and a keen sense of humor, we couldn't help but like this guy.  He truly made this a 5 star moment for us.  I can't wait to take my Best Girl to our local Maggiano's!",

    "text": "I got talked into going here! If I made the dinner choice I would not have chosen Maggiano's but now after having it I can't wait to go back! I ordered the chicken picatta. The chicken was cooked just right and it had just the right amount of capers.  It came with angel hair pasta that they put in a separate bowel.  I also ordered a side of grilled asparagus.    I have been craving this chicken picatta since I finished eating mine! I was informed there is one in San Jose...I will be checking that one out as well and hope it will be just as tasty!  The restaurant is located at Fashion Show mall.  I'm usually not a big fan of mall food but this was pretty darn good.  Service was slow but they were friendly. There were a lot of people and the wait was around 45 minutes so we decided to head to the bar for seating.  We lucked out and found two bar seats.    Great food, decent service, I would go back!",

I know it's a chain and I would have thought I would have been to one by now considering they are all over the place in the DMV area. Surprisingly so, I had not and my first visit to a Maggiano's Little Italy in Las Vegas was a pleasant one. When I arrived they had to tap a keg for a Newcastle that I wanted, this was sort of annoying because it felt like forever but I was watching football (and gambling on it) at the time.  Our waitress was a real sweetheart, and she checked on us regularly. I had a few (2) beers before my meal and they didn't seem to mind. The ambiance was really cool, but I could have told it was a chain type restaurant even if I didn't know.   The food was great. They brought out bread before the meal and we weren't very hungry so I didn't order an appetizer. I had the center cut filet mignon and the person I was with had the salmon salad. We were both very pleased with the overall meal.   I was very pleased with this chain restaurant and would go back again.",

    "text": "Honestly, why have I not found this chain sooner!?  Maggiano's was my favorite place of my Vegas trip. I must admit, it was slightly biased- I was part of an organization, and the organization catered the food.. so I had, literally, had a TON of food. Nonetheless, it was the best way to try the food!  First, the appetizers came out. After having the appetizers, I was pretty set on making that my lunch! There was bruschetta, tomato caprese, two types of salad, but my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms. OH MAN, SO GOOD. I was trying to be all professional at this lunch, but all I really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate. It was so juicy and flavorful!   Next, came the actual entrees. After filling up on the mushrooms and good salads, I was about stuffed already. The entrees were all really good as well! There was the Four Cheese ravioli (mmm, def was one of my faves!), herb chicken, pork medallions (also, one of my faves!), some pasta + vodka dish, and some great tasting beef. It was all really really good.  What really topped the meal off (well, any meal for all I'm concerned about) was the DESSERTS. First, these gigantic profiteroles came out, made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream. But, my favorite of all time came out.. the tiramisu!! As tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert, I had high expectations of this dessert.. and it was met. It was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right.. I was in heaven.   Our waiter was great as well, explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks. He even answered nicely to all my curious questions of, \"so... what exactly is that? What is it cooked in?\" etc.   Perhaps my view was slightly biased as I did not even have to pay for this lunch, but all I know, is the food was GREAT, and I would love to find a Maggiano's close to me! Mmm. :)",

There isn't a Maggiano's in the Bay Area, but this best resembles Romano's Macaroni Grill and/or Olive Garden.  My boyfriend and I came here for lunch before our flight home and ordered: -Rigatoni D: chicken, mushrooms and rigatoni pasta [I forgot what sauce was used...since this was my boyfriend's plate and I didn't really eat off of it cuz my sandwich was so filling]. - Seared Salmon Sandwich: the sandwich included 1) seared salmon was so moist, 2) applewood bacon was so crispy, 3) avocado gave it the perfect ring to my sandwich (I LOVE avocados in my sandwich), 4) tomato, 5) lettuce.  The brioche bread was so fresh and soft!  Kettle chips was a bonus!  Bill wasn't too bad for 2 people considering how full we were.  More worth it than other places on the strip and our waiter was superrr nice & friendly!",

It's family style so it's obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large - even for family style. The stuffed mushroom appetizer, the caesar salads and the linguine/clams in red sauce are my recommendations. The service at this restaurant is amazing, as well. My drink was never  empty, they timed each course perfectly so that I was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before I had time to even notice they were gone.  Great experience!  The restaurant is, also, on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights.",

It's attached to the Fashion Show Mall, and it seemed like most were just grabbing a quick bite in the food court instead.   I liked the fact that our server asked if we preferred butter or olive oil and parmesan to go along with our bread. Gimme' the oil and parm, please! A pet peeve of mine is that a few select Italian restaurants in St. Louis want to up-charge for this... yes, seriously. Anywho, we carbed out on the stuff. :)  I ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni, while my husband went with the chicken parmesan. Both lunch portions were friggin' HUGE! My husband actually had two full breasts of chicken on his plate served with a large side of pasta. Four noodles came in my order, and had big chunks of chicken in every bite. We made a good dent in the dishes, but still had plenty left over. We both agreed that it was good, but it didn't compare to the good ole' authentic Italian we both love so much.",

The food feels like its been prepared with care and the place is comfortable without being too commercial.  And their Las Vegas location is no exception.  The Maggiano's Salad and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake are a must try.  What was particularly interesting for this visit was the wine I had.   I usually find it difficult to smell what I'm suppose to smell in red wine: hints of strawberries, cherries, oak, vanilla, leather, sunshine, earth, wind, fire, etc, whatever.  Not this time: I smelled the floral bouquet that was suppose to be in my red.  I was so shocked that I was practically snorting instead of drinking it. The only reason I stopped was I heard our waiter ask, \"Is everything okay, sir?\"  And as I looked up from my glass to answer, I saw the wife shaking her head with the \"What are you doing?\" look and the waiter slightly looming behind her with a smirk. I placed my glass down and responded, \"We're fine.  Thank you.\" I should've responded with \"This wine may have gone sour.  Could you please bring me something else?\"  But then he would have taken the only wine I could smell properly.",

(I did have a side of fettucine alfredo though.) Having said that, I'm happy to report that these crab cakes were in fact some of the best I've had. Ever. Moist, tender, flavorful crab mixed with the perfect blend of spices and cooked to perfection. They were accompanied by a ridiculous pile of yummy onion strings that were a nice compliment.   <a href=\"http://static2.px.yelp.com/photo/Oom3jxuiY_gq_lwTtVaq_Q/l\">static2.px.yelp.com/phot...</a>   The calamari was pretty good although in my ravenous state, those were gone before I remembered to whip out my camera. Boo. Hubs had an entree of pork medallions in a cream sauce that I had a bite or two of. Goody good good. His side of spaghetti marinara was just okay though.   <a href=\"http://static2.px.yelp.com/photo/Fr6nMhzpaaicLsx_ZBczgg/l\">static2.px.yelp.com/phot...</a>  Service was a bit lacking unfortunately. The waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink aside from water and didn't really tend to us until the end of our meal. So I had to take away a star for that. Aside from that, I'll definitely return for the food and food alone.  Mangia!",

    "text": "We were struggling with trying to have a good reasonably priced dinner for 22 in las Vegas. Everyplace we called wanted us to rent a private room, order from a pricey  catering menu and guarantee a minimum. Believe it or not, the totals were coming up to almost  FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS  including liquor,  tip tax and service charges.  We decided to have the dinner in our suite at Caesars and have maggiano's deliver. Best decision ever. Ashley guided us through the process and we had tons of great food at a fraction of the cost. They delivered on time, set everything up and left. We even had leftovers for lunch the next day. The food was actually better than I thought it would be. Bread, desert,  salad, entrees, everything was great. Would use this place again.  Total tab was under $500. We spent another hundred at the liquor store setting up our bar. Even if you add the cost of our 2 bedroom suite, we're still ahead. First time I won in Vegas.   Great night.",

I want to say our servers name was nestor? but I could be wrong, either way... great service. we had the margherita flatbread to start (delicious) and our server recommended a  dush to me which was amazing.  it was nicknamed \"grown up mac n cheese\" but it was nothing like mac and cheese.  I rarely ever give a place 2 thumbs up or five star etc etc... but the food and service were amazing.",

We didn't have the coupon for BOGO but he still let us take home 7 classic pastas home for free with the order of 7 classic pastas at the mention of the coupon. Service was great and I can't get enough of the balsamic vinegar nd oil and bread. Although he did forget about the birthdays and i had to remind him again to bring out the cookies in the end. Since it WAS a classic pasta, the lasagna was a little dry, fettucini was extremely bland, but the spaghetti was really goodand came with a good portion.This was my 2nd time here And the first time was in San Jose. My first experience was better because we didnt do the BOGO and ordered specialty pastas and seafood. But I guess you get what you pay for.",

The service was superb, truly the best service we encountered anywhere in a long while. Loved the setting, the atmosphere and the food. I do have one complaint: during the dinner there was a young lady walking around with the camera, offering to take couples photo. At first my husband declined, as he felt he was underdressed, but she insisted that the photo was complimentary, and lingered around until we agreed. She returned toward the end of our dinner with a complimentary postcard as well as two large photos she wanted us to purchase for $40. When we declined, she went down in price and seemed offended we did not want to buy them, when we did not want ANY pictures to begin with. This really should not be taking place during dinner as it is in bad taste and cheapens the whole experience.",

The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star is because I was a little disappointed at the cleaniness of this place the second time I went there. I figured there was a kid sitting in our booth before us and the floor and seats were full of crumbs and very dirty. Seriously? the booster seat was still under the table... Other than that, this place is very good, definitely worth a try.",

We kept giving them \"one more chance\" because we loved the food, but ultimately we gave up and resorted to just getting to-go orders.  Now, I know carry-out is never as good as eating in the actual restaurant, but we adjusted our expectations accordingly and were quite pleased with this compromise.  Until tonight.   We had a pretty simple order- Chicken fettuccine alfredo, meatball sub, zucchini fritte, and a side of bread.  Strike 1: they were out of meatballs Strike 2: they forgot the bread, although they did give us butter so I guess they thought about giving us bread? Strike 3: I've literally had better alfredo at the Olive Garden.   There was no chicken. There was no fettuccine. It was undercooked penne. And I don't mean al dente. I mean stiff and barely chewable. This penne was swimming in what I can only describe as some bland cheese milk.   I gave two stars because the zucchini was amazing, as always. Except \"always\" isn't quite True either because they were out of the zucchini the last two times we had tried to order.   I'm afraid my former favorite has finally run out of chances.",

    "text": "I went with Maggiano's solely on the reviews of fellow Yelpers and brides everywhere online. I'd never eaten here prior, but I'm a little risk taker, and figured that hundreds of honest reviews cannot be wrong. I was SO RIGHT!!  We had our reception in the DiCarlo room on 3/28/16. Small crowd (26 ppl) and a dance floor w/a DJ. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place.   The Decor = Old world Italian (think 1950s, which went GREAT with my wedding theme of tea length dresses and fedoras).   The Service = Our waitstaff was very attentive, and very friendly. Our server kept making sure that we were all full with food and drinks in hand.  The Food = OMG. This was some of the BEST  I'd ever had. It was Family Style. We decided to go with the Milano Package (which included 4 HOUR open bar of premium liquor, and various wine, appetizers, salads, pasta, main course, and desert). We had SO MUCH FOOD that we ended up leaving with 5 trays of \"to go\" items that we just ate for dinner last night. Thank God we had a DJ to work off the food.   The Nitty Gritty =  I'm not sure if this goes for ALL the rooms, but to book a room (DiCarlo) there is a minimum of $1200 that needs to be spent (If your food package is less than that amount, you can always use DJ svs, cakes, decorations etc...as part of the minimum if booked through Maggiano's which is AWESOME). They do charge a 20% event Fee (before tax) for the private room used. Additional gratuity is optional as your waitstaff is paid at a higher rate for your event.  HIGHLY recommended. For someone like myself who is a total control freak, these amazing Coordinators @ Maggiano's took care of everything that was required to make this day memorable. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!",

Then I picked and paid for extra plates that also came out one at a time. We had the room till 5 but the food was coming so late that ran us behind.   What's more upsetting is that they litearly came out with one plate of each item ordered, NO REFILLS! so don't believe them when they say they will refill because they won't. Then at 5 while we are still eating our ordered desert they stormed the room and KICKED US OUT. They said they have another event in 30m, which would have been okay with us to leave on time if they didn't run late on everything.   Our event was also disrupted by a live band next door that they failed to mention it will be there, even though I called and emailed their banquet staff many times to make sure my event goes smoothly. It was the biggest regret for me to go there, one of the worst service, place to hold your baby shower. The food is good but it's not worth the aggrevation or treatment you will get.",

However, I have not been back to this place for at least 3 years because there are so many Italian restaurants in town. I came back last night for my friends bday and found out they've changed their menu quite a bit. I guess my palate has changed as well and became more picky. I wasn't completely satisfied.   I was surprised that they don't have any pesto sauce on any dish. They also took away the half/ full size. They only have one size for their entrees  now where it's more for individuals rather than sharing. I guess that makes more sense for the restaurants on the profit sides.  After I sat down, it took the server 10 minutes to bring me some water and then another 5 or 10 minutes to take my drink order. Even though I was the only one who arrived in our table, I was bit annoyed by it. The server was friendly though. I wasn't sure if they were under staffed or he's just keep forgetting about me.   I was not impressed by any of the pasta we tried. We tried fettuccine Alfredo, gnocchi and Italian sausage, and shrimp scampi. Alfredo sauce was not creamy enough. I like the vodka cream sauce in gnocchi but gnocchi was overcooked. I don't think I will return anytime soon.",

When they brought out our food, they brought the appetizer and salad at the same time then about 2 minutes later brought the main courses and acted like it was our problem there wasnt room on the table. And besides the waiter being terrible, our favorite dish their \"famous\" rigatoni D had a different sauce than normal. It was thicker and more of a straight mushroom sauce. If it's their \"famous\" dish, why would they change it!? It was awful!! We had the family style meal for 7 people, so it definitely wasn't cheap! It was my husbands birthday, which I indicated when I made the reservation but we were seated at a table that was basically in the aisle and the back of the restaurant.

Despite the long wait (we were seated about an hour after our reservation was scheduled), the wait was worth it.  I had the Lobster Carbonara.  I cannot emphasize enough how AWESOME it was.  It honestly is the best pasta dish I have EVER had.  I thought it was a bit overpriced when looking at the menu, but I would absolutely get it again.  FANTASTIC.  Be prepared for a wait for a table, but from our experience, you won't be disappointed with the food.  I highly recommend it!",

From the moment you go up the elevator and those double glass doors open to maggianos entrance things differ. A reservation was made at 10pm and upon being greeted was seated in a very haste but efficient way. Very good from the get go. We were escorted to the tables in the back and the lighting, decor and just about every nook and cranny seemed to give off a right at home vibe with elegance mixed in, a beautiful restaurant. It's easy to forget that this is a chain restaurant. We were greeted by one of the kindest waiters as of recent memory , puzzled by what to order wth the amazing selections I had asked for a recommendation on two dishes I had trouble picking of, and gave me his honest opinion. He recommended I go with a different plate and happily I listened . Absolutely no regrets! The rigatoni d was absolutely outstanding blending different flavors into one amazing plate, a smile was shown across my face with every bite. The waiter was very attentive offering bread when the basket was empty and making sure we enjoyed every bite , extremely knowledgeable  of the food he serves. Restaurant operators take note of this Guy , a fabulous waiter with an amazing dinner equals an experience that is unforgettable, making sure to take guests who aren't familiar with this establishment here and giving this place a try. The food the decor the atmosphere the staff, truly a five star experience kudos to the manager and everyone in the front and back who makes the maggianos experience come to fruition !  5 star review",

The food was delicious, the linguine frutti de mares was excellent, extra large portion with extra mussels, clams, lobster, and a kick of spices, which is appetizing for a hot summer night.  I wanted a lighter fare so I ordered the caprese mozzarella and the cheese was so good.  I did order grilled scallops for my main course, but I think it was sitting under the lights for too long and the scallops were overcooked...to the point of being stringy and hard.  The manager took the order away and offered to replace the scallops for another dish on the house.  At that point we were full from the pasta dish so we declined.  I think it was just an oversight on such a busy night.  Beside this incident, we really enjoyed our meal at Maggiano, service was excellent, food was delicious, ambiance was authentic and on point.  If you're craving for some real authentic italian food, this place is a great option.",

Either way, they are welcoming; but the wait time can be long so I recommend getting a reservation if necessary, especially during weekend nights.  You get complimentary bread in the beginning after you order, but don't eat too much of it because the dishes are pretty big. I have ordered the \"Famous Rigatoni 'D'\" couple of times and the \"Peppercorn-Crusted Sirloin\"; they were both good! The Rigatoni can get really heavy because of the Marsala cream sauce, but don't get me wrong, the flavors are all there. The mushrooms & the chicken go really well with the pasta and the sauce.   Last time I went, I got the Sirloin cooked as medium, but it was pretty chewy so next time I get that, I will be sure to get it medium-rare. I had to cut them into little tiny dices to get through them. The garlic mash potatoes that were on the plate added a nice touch to the sirloin.  I never have room for dessert when I eat here because the proportions are pretty big! But it fills me up so I'm not complaining. The waiters are all so kind here, but the noise level can get really high, especially if there is a large group of people sitting in the middle celebrating a birthday or whatever. Besides that, I've had pretty good experiences with Maggiano's!!",

I am also in love with the marinara sauce they use for the spaghetti as well as the chicken parmesan. Friendly staff & usually not very crowded when I come here. & I feel like I'm in the 1940s with the music they play. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat.",

Being right on the strip and having the whole wall on the strip side being windows it's a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels.  I've had so many different meals here and never been disappointed.  The chicken parm. the rigatoni D(my favorite pasta dish here) and the Marsala are all fantastic.  For the price it is the best Italian restaurant I have ever been too and have been going to this Maggianos location for the last four years.  I've been to places in Vegas that are twice the price, half the portion, and 1/4 the food quality.   Don't miss this place if your in Vegas!",

    "text": "Came for a bachelorette party dinner.  There was about 10 in our group and opted for the family style menu.  We chose the classic menu which came with a choice of 3 appetizer or salad, 4 main courses, and 2 desserts.  From what I remember, we had the calamari which was amazing, the bruschetta which was also amazing, and the maggiano's salad the salad was pretty good.  For our main courses, we had the chicken parm. I was not really a fan of this dish just because if was overly breaded.  We also had the peppercorn crusted sirloin.  This dish was really good. The meat was tender and the flavors were good.  Along with our meat dishes, we ordered baked ziti and fettuccine alfredo.  I enjoyed the baked ziti but the fettuccine alfredo was too much on the thick side where the noodles clump up together.  The dessert we chose are tiramisu and creme brulee both were yummy. The creme brulee was on the little runny side but it was a really good runny kind.  There were so much food that we even had tons for left overs.  Everyone enjoyed their food before food coma sets in.   The service was very very very good.  The host was able to hold our table even past the 15 min hold time because our party was so late.  Our wait staff was so friendly and soft spoken.  She was attentive but not annoying.  She approached our table frequently but not too frequent.  Drinks were refilled  before they  even reached half way.  Overall, it was a great experience.  I would recommend this place for big groups who has a budget because to be honest restaurants at Vegas can get super expensive and not everyone can afford them.  Would I come here again??? Of course!! I am actually planning on having my family  bday dinner at the one in LA.",

There are not many private rooms and the ones that offer it have extremely large minimums.  (So i'm mentioning banquet many times in the hope if will make it easier to find and share a good experience.)  Many positive things, including... no surprises at any time... what they said is what we received.  One of the best things... setting up the event.  Unlike almost any other event departments, anyone you email or call (one email, one phone number), no matter who picks up the phone (no screening), they immediately can answer your question.  This is a product of incredible management planning/system/training.  Food was excellent and staff really cared.  Nice strip view as well and a little outside patio. They have three rooms that connect, so they great flexibility for any size group.  I would go on, but have to get to work.",

I requested extra veggies and was charged 4 bucks extra for that, but i did count the veggies in my pasta and there were exactly 8 cauliflower pieces and 1 single piece of zucchini (or just the zucchini outer skin) I showed it to our server and he told manager. Manager came up and did offer desert on the house and we did have tiramisu, but somehow there was miscommunication and server was unaware of the fact that desert is on the house because pasta was really really inedible(specially for an expecting mom). The worst thing is I still ended up paying full amount for the pasta and extra money for invisible but so called extra veggies in it. May be people like this place for fine dining, but wont suggest my friends to go there.",

(PSST  there's a $10 off $30 purchase coupon available on their website)   We were seated at the time on our reservation and treated to very attentive service.  The house chianti was good.  Bread was served soon after we were seated and waiter was kind enough to bring out some red pepper flakes and Italian herbs that we could add to the olive oil.  The waiter explained that they were no longer doing half orders & I thought I understood him to say that the menu had been redone and the portions as well as prices were now smaller.  No matter--the lady at the next table had a rather large platter of food and I was pretty sure we weren't going hungry.  I had linguine with shrimp & garlic  (what, I like red wine with that), and my friend had the rustic chicken & shrimp.  I love that they are not afraid to use the garlic here.  My shrimp were big and cooked perfectly and the sauce enhanced it beautifully without overwhelming the seafood.  And there were leftovers (just as good for breakfast the next day).  For around $16 a plate (before the coupon), it's hard to find food this good in Vegas.",

Our server was a tiny, bubbly blonde who I wish I could have put in my pocket and taken home with me. She was sweet and happy and very personable.  We ordered an appetizer of and then I had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband ordered linguine and clams with the white sauce.   The app was simply prepared and just lovely. My Alfredo was smooth and creamy. It was very flavorful and not oily at all. The linguine was bursting with clams. Nicely prepared with most of the clams tossed in with the pasta and a handful still in shells scattered over top. The wine sauce was fantastic. We also had red wine which was their special house red blend. Also excellent!  We were completely stuffed and declined dessert, but our awesome waitress showed us that they serve little mini desserts for just $2.50... I went with the chocolate cake and my husband got the creme brulee. They were both, of course, to die for. So good!  In the end I found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel and leaving the lovely atmosphere (with lots of Frank Sinatra playing in the background) and warm, comfortable interior of the restaurant. It was just lovely.  Like I said, best meal we had the whole trip!",

(they don't they are 100% beef)  up to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized, sloppy and chaotic. it took 20 minutes to get bread on the table.  ------THE REASON FOR 1 STAR------  we were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table. as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about 5\" it turns out there was a hole about 2-3\" deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room.. i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me. i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said WHEN I WAS IN THE HOLE PULLING MY CHAIR BACK OUT. \"OH YEAH THERE IS A HOLE THERE\" WTF kind of observation is that. if you know about a preexisting hazard FIX IT!!!  long story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting. we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems.  i wasn't about to have my last night in Vegas be ruined by that. for my Pain and all this we got 25% taken off the bill. and i left hurting and in pain.  i think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard, have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldn't have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt.",

Got seated towards the back area with a view of the Encore/Wynn, our server was a great host since obviously we were the only ones there, provided great privacy and comfort to act a little hung over. I ordered the chicken florentine to my surprise, it was delicious and was a great proportion where I felt skinny for not tearing up my plate! (Or maybe it was my slight hangover?) The food is great for it being a mainstream/chain restaurant. I was expecting it to be like a Coco's type, but to gladly it exceeded my expectations. Will come back on my next visit and will recommend!  Happy munching!",
