What a pleasant surprise -  attentive service, a nice private dining room, and excellent food.  They were happy to accommodate a vegetarian in our group  with a beautiful and tasty platter of veggies, but made sure we were all treated well.  Raviolis were very good, fried cheese was perfect and the entrees were very good.  Cheesecake and creme brulee were executed extremely well.  For a restaurant that can just \"dial it in\" without attention to detail, they paid keen attention to detail for our group and it showed in a very happy group of diners.  Go back again?  Yup.",

My husband and I ordered a bottle of wine, for instance.  The waiter poured and took the bottle away.  Never once did our glasses go empty, however. He constantly monitored our table, but never once did we feel \"monitored\".  My husband ordered the crab claws for a starter and the swordfish as his main.  Both were perfectly cooked and quite tasty.  I had the Caesar salad and the Chilean sea bass.  My salad was good, but it was not special. The dressing was just too heavy. The sea bass was the best I've ever tasted.  I will definitely go back.",

Service was prompt, warm and friendly. Now...let's go straight to the food!!  Oso Bucco...yummy. Marrow is so heavenly. The seasoning was a little too light for me. I like well flavored meat. Don't get me wrong, it is very good. The meat was tender.  Fetuccini Alfredo was amazing!!!! Rich sauce ....one of the best pasta dishes I experienced. You have to try this entree.  Filet Mignon...well cooked. It was ok but not the star of the show. I was too inebriated to tell if it was prime meat.   We had a side dish of sweet corn. Which was awesome. I love corn. Who doesn't ?  It's a tad pricey but well worth it. It's a good place for a special occasion.",

It's all old school all the way here, and I stress-- authentically old school, not a cheap chain knock-off.  It's the perfect place for people who have already found the men, women and friends that they want in their lives and don't give a rat's sphincter about seeing or being seen.  We're barflies so we eat and drink in the lounge and enjoy Pia Zadora when she's in town paying homage to all her old Rat Pack friends and lovers and their music.   The Osso Bucco is delish.  As is the eggplant parm. The last two times we were there they had Florida Stone Crab in the shell at $15 a pop (yeah, that's EACH), with a minimum purchase of 3.  We had 6, (yeah half a dozen) so, you do the math.  Only order them if you really, really love Stone Crab and haven't had them in a while and are absolutely dying for them--then, and only then, will they be worth the price. But, they were very fresh, large, and good, just like Joe's Stone Crab in Miami. Once you get past the sticker shock,  you won't be disappointed.",

To start I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which was pretty tasty.   I went with the Osso Bucco per our waiter's recommendation and he was right on.  It was phenomenal, the meat was tender and the marrow was so yummy.  My dad had the \"La Zuppa Di Pesce\" and it looked fantastic as well.  I didn't get to try it as I was stuffed after devouring the Osso Bucco, but my dad loved it and they definitely don't skimp on the shellfish.  If you're in the mood to get off the strip or just want to try a new place, I would highly recommend Piero's as the food is fantastic and the service is top notch.",

    "text": "For my Century Yelp review, I couldn't go with any other than what is becoming a breed dying off faster than the gangsters who built Vegas did: a True institution which still lives up to its past glory while taking you back in time during your dining experience. Having a strong drink and a chat with Don at the bar can yield some fantastic Rat Pack lore. Usually, a crooner and a band will lend to the vibe.   If you've seen the movie Casino, you've seen the interior: dark, clubby, with well dressed patrons (make reservations) Captains, helpful Sommelier and slightly reminiscent of the interior of the Venetian Restaurant (on Sahara, where Herbs & Rye holds court) My folks and family have been frequenting Piero's for years and are greeted as familia. It is always bustling, with locals and tourists alike.   Famous for the \"garbage\" Caesar (delicious and chock full of unexpected, but perfect ingredients which takes a classic to another level) Osso Bucco is one of the most famous dishes this kitchen prepares (for a rumored 6 hours) and everyone I know who has had it, raves and orders it again and again. Simple dishes such as Pasta Puttsnesca are also given the respect and a twist which makes them stand outs. Seafood dishes are stars here, as are saltimbocca, lamb and chicken standards. Steaks come prepared as ordered and with raves, always extra sides arrive, the creamed corn being a favorite. My dish is usually Zuppa di Pesce, though sometimes since they know me so well, I'll go with a suggested special, or just ask for an off menu item. This is the kind of Italian fare we'd have at Nonna's in Bensonhurst on Sundays, slow cooked with great love and simple, fresh ingredients. Meals are never rushed, it is an experience.   Usually aperitifs like Limoncello, grappa and Sambucca are savored with demitasse and an array of desserts suggested or sent by the house. By all means, trust the experience and suggestions of the staff here, choose a wine with the help of the Sommelier and take a step back in time while enjoying a very rare place where old Las Vegas meets new Las Vegas without losing any of its glory. One almost expects Old Blue Eyes, Sammy and Dean to sidle up to the next table...  Yelp 100 Challenge: 1 of 100 (and my 100th review!)",

The Caesar was excellent,  the mozzarella a nice light tasting salad. For mains we had the oso bucca and prime rib.  My partners only complaint with her oso bucca was that it was too much meat and pasta for her,  but that's not a bad thing. The prime rib was seared which was new for me but sealed in the juices really well.  The wine list is excellent as is the service.  A bit noisy for the romantic dinner I had planned but overall a very good (expensive)  meal",

Well, sure enough, just after we ordered they sat next to us. They were out of control...I mean, even for an Olive Garden, they were out of control. Right as I was about to go up front to the maitre D a young man came to our table and said he was so sorry about the people next to us & he wanted to buy us a drink and put us at a different table. His name was Evan & he was the owner. I couldn't believe it. I've never had anyone do that before. Really a class act. Our dinner & evening was saved due to the owner taking care of us. Dinner was amazing,, but I would go back just because of how the owner handled our situation.. Thank you, again, Evan. You are a first rate owner that takes care of business.",

No need to walk through a casino to get to the restaurant because it's a standalone building.  Service is impeccable and waiter/waitress are friendly and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting.  There's a bar area and a traditional restaurant area.  Now to talk about the food which was fantastico! I had the Garbage Caesar which was meal in and of itself with big portions of shrimp and avocado.  Very unique take on a classic salad.  In addition, I ordered the Veal Osso Bucco which was unlike anything I've ever had before.  The meet was so tender and cooked perfectly along with an excellent red sauce. It melted in your mouth.

Piero's is a place my husband and I have taken our staff and family to multiple times for special occasions like our company Christmas party and family reunions.  Our last experience here on 2/19/2017 is our very last.    My husband and I brought our folks and 4 other family members with us.  There were 9 people in our party.    Here's what I could not believe:  1.  We were ignored.  We were seated and it took 15 minutes for our server to arrive to take our drink order.  This continued through the evening.   2.  We ordered the Stone Crab claws, 9 of them at $16 per claw for an appetizer.  We were excited to try them however, I believe our order was forgotten and it never came.   3.  The food was disappointing.   My husband ordered the Sea Bass which was overcooked and a bit fishy smelling.   My father in law ordered pollo al carciofi and the chicken was overcooked and dry.   My folks ordered the otoletta alla griglia -- a simple veal chop cooked on the grill however they received something else which was breaded and slathered in sauce.   4.  Piero's charged us $20 for Johnny Walker Black and charged an additional $2 to add ice.    ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?! $2 MORE FOR ICE CUBES???  With 9 people at an average cost of $120.00 per person, there were too many mishaps and lack of attention to us, our food, and our overall experience.  When I reviewed the itemized bill the next morning, the $2 more per Johnny Walker to be served on the rocks was just ridiculous.  This turned a disappointing experience into \"never again.\"",

When you walk in the place you feel like it's a little mom-and-pop restaurant in New York and the smell in there is to die for. But everytime I come to Vegas this place is on my GPS all the time. Highly recommended,give it a try.",

    "text": "*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***  I've been wanting to try Piero's for many years.  It's one of those places that have a lot of history with the city and some of its famous entertainers and residents.  I was brought bread and iced tea soon after being seated.  For the first course, there was no choice.  It was an agnolotti and cheese combination.  There were five agnolotti in a cream sauce and a triangle shaped piece of fried mozzarella.  The server ground parmesan onto the agnolotti to my liking.  This starter dish was very good.  When eating the fried mozzarella, I couldn't help but think of my students and their senior prom.  They always cleared the place out of mozzarella sticks.    The second course was a choice salads.  I chose the Caesar and the server did freshly ground pepper to my liking.  The romaine was as crisp as can be and the dressing was great!  A large salad course but I managed!  For the third course, I had to go with the house specialty--Osso Buco.  It was amazing!  The meat gently came off the bone and the sauce in which the veal shank was braised was very good.  The server brought me a cocktail fork and stuck it in the bone to use as a marrow fork.  A straw would have been a good idea, too!  Along with the Osso Buco, there was a nice sized mound of fettuccine.  It had the brazing sauce poured over it.  Again, the server round parmesan over the dish.  I've had Osso Buco a few times before but it was never this good.  You can tell their process takes hours.    Service throughout the night was exemplary.  There must have been 10 people at least on duty and every one of them worked every table.  I was asked several times if I wanted a fresh iced tea.  When I finished my first glass, immediately a server appeared to take the glass to be refilled.  An empty pack of Sweet 'n Low was removed within moments of putting it on the table.  One of the servers who hadn't been at my table took my check and payment.  No waiting.  It's all for one and one for all.    Many of the Yelp reviews refer to this as old school.  I agree, and I think it's a great idea.  Seeing the servers with white jackets, watching the plates be pushed by my table on a rolling cart, having service that is outstanding--these may be characteristics of old school, and it's good that some places retain their old school ways.  My only complaint with the place is the mandatory valet parking.  The lot isn't that big.  I can walk.  If some want to valet, let them.  A requirement--no, it shouldn't be!",

The sauce was watery and the penne itself didn't appear to home made. When your paying $34.00 for a dish of it better be excellent! I always have the same dish at Il Fornaio for half the price and it's far superior. I would give the waiter 4 stars and the busboy 3. I'm Ok paying higher prices but you better back it up with great food and great service all around. The busboy reached across the table to refill our water glasses. He was also too quick to remove our plates. Reaching to grab before asking if we wanted them removed. He obviously wasn't trained in busboy etiquette for a fine dining experience. Needless to say they're far better Italian restaurants in Vegas for a lot less.",

From the first to the last bite the flavor is bursting in my mouth! I absolutely love having our date nights at Piero's! Lastly, the mood... so romantic! Famous movies have been filmed there which just adds the cherry on top of the whole experience. What an absolutely amazing Valentine's Day again this year! Thank you Piero's for existing even if it's in a little Vegas corner. It is totally worth the $$$$$. Xo!",

    "text": "True classic. Osso Bucco should come with a discount on a divorce attorney. Savory, moist, tender and plenty of double entendres make the shank my favorite meal in town. My wife is a showgirl and I love her to death but this OB aid worth her having 50%. Fresh bread and marrow complete the OBT (Osso Bucco Trifecta).  The veal parm looks like it was pounded by some little Italian gent with a steamroller attachment on his bobcat in a special section of the kitchen exclusively for pounding out parm proteins. Perfectly thin and delightful. Add the eggplant parm on top of the veal parm for a date with heaven or a visit from the grim reaper for the lactose intolerant like myself. Sometimes the dish and delight are worth the pain. Divorce attorney discount still applies here as well but this time it's for my wife. Don't get tricked into a signature salad as the house is crisp, fresh and included. Add more lactose if you dare with some of the danish blue cheese to accompany said house greens. I tend to want to make everyone around me appreciate their ability to digest dairy and my inability of course by loading up on the complimentary creamed corn. Again being asked to sleep in different quarters after a meal at Piero's is about as fair as a catholic nun at a bingo hall dispute. For apps don't be afraid of the stone claws when in season as well as the Calamari. Portions on the latter will surely put squid on the endangered species list one day so act accordingly and be responsible in ordering every other visit. If your drinks aren't stiff something is wrong ask if the bartender is new.   In all sincerity, you won't find a better dining experience start to finish than Piero's in LV. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Probably one of the most classic Italian restaurants in Vegas. If you are of the decent, or a native, it's a must try. I love the old school, gangster, Rat Pack, mobster vibe so much. It's very classy, and once inside, you can just feel the history in this place. I was lucky enough to try the meatballs hand made by one of the owners of over 20+ years, and it took me right back to my roots. I felt like I was in my own family's kitchen for a moment. True hospitality at its finest. I always feel welcome and never rushed out the door. It's a dining experience, not just dinner. Need help pairing a wine with each course, they will assist. The dim lighting and large booths make it perfect for a romantic night out. However they offer private dining areas if you wanted to throw Holiday dinner, or birthday party here. It's pricey, but you're not just paying for an amazing melt in your mouth dish. You are paying to leave your worries at the door for 2 hours, and be taken somewhere else.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am not a big Italian fan anymore only because my BF is asian he is not a fan so I do not get to eat it.  So when my GF suggested Italian for our girls night I was totally in the mood!  Our search began and ended here we decided to go old school I remembered a client telling me of her old days in Las Vegas when she was a showgirl hanging with the \"in\" crowd (the mafia) the show people and their cohorts.  So in the mood for some ambiance we decided to have some snacks here then move on for the rest of the night.  We pull up (Valet only) nice guy and walk in we already know we did not want the restaurant because we only wanted a few shared plates and cocktails.  So we opted for the front bar.  They had a small 3 person band think Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin style.  They have nice booths against the wall to cosy up in or a bar to sit and watch the small rooms happenings.  We chose the end of the bar to watch the performers eat our food and enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.  The decor of the room I thought was both fun and funny, completely decked out in monkeys, monkeys everywhere!    Now on to the food... Prosciutto Con Melone thinly sliced Parma ham and melon.  I loved the way the salt of the thinly sliced Prosciutto went both agains and with the sweet, slightly bitter of the Mellon.   Agnolotti Freschi Alla Crema, country style fresh pasta stuffed with spinach, served with cream sauce.  Amazing, one of the best pasta dishes I have had.  The home made pasta breaks apart easily (but not to easy) to be able to tell it really is fresh.  The cream sauce has enough flavor to showcase the gentle blending of flavors of the spinach and cream.  I chose to add pepper because I like the kick of it.  On to the service and ambiance the service is top notch but with a bit of the New York attitude (if you've been there you know).  Everyone is taking orders,bringing, cleaning or walking around to see if one of the priors need to be done.  In other words great old school service.  Ambiance, lots of interesting things to keep your eyes and ears happy.  Sit at the bar and get to know a few New York transplants, or tourist who have heard about the great pasta or some old questionable members of our community who could quite possibly be in the old school mafia...  Any how The Pasta is great, the ambiance is fun, the bartenders know the wines and the servers know the menus, the people around you are a free added bonus.  I will be back and have a few times since I started this review.    A side note the prices on some items have been raised about $1 since my first visit.  Still worth it.",

The wait staff is helpful and attentive.  I was surprised that that our waiter did not have a printed copy of the Restaurant Week menu. However he was able to recite it to us. The Restaurant Week menu consisted of large portions for all 3 courses.  The ravioli were tender pillows in a light broth. The calamari was served in a large bowl that could feed two people.  The house and caesar salads were very good but again super size. The Osso Buco veal shank was as tender as it gets. The bed of fettuccine is too much for the average person. Eat the veal leave the pasta.  Pollo Carciofi is a boneless breast of chicken with artichoke hearts and a garlic wine sauce. The chicken is served already cut into small pieces. The amount of artichokes out numbered the chicken. Overall Piero's provided a wonderful meal to start off Restaurant Week.",

We started at the bar before being seated and the Lemon Drop Martini was made to perfection, after being seated we had the calamari, crab claws & garbage caesar salad to start. The portions were perfect for sharing (party of 3).  I ordered one of the specials that was told to us by the waiter, the veal & eggplant parmesan, this combo was absolutely delicious.  It was cooked to perfection and the veal was very tender.  My friends ordered the Ribeye which I had a taste of and not only was it the largest steak I've ever seen and cooked perfectly med/rare but the flavor was outstanding.  My other friend had the fresh fish I believe mahi mahi with pasta on the side, he ate it so fast I didn't get a chance to taste it but he said it was excellent.  For dessert we shared a creme brulee which I think I can say was the best I've ever had.  Our wait staff was very attentive and kept the drinks flowing.  It was a over all A+ dining experience and I can't wait to go back which will be much sooner than later.",

Bernie the barman absolutely phenomenal service from Bernie he was on point and offered recommendations; any service industry company would be happy to have him.  Tim my waiter words can't express the service that he also offered kudos and finally Bruce, although very little interaction and you can tell by his persona that he truly enjoys what he is doing and also a great asset to the company.  This is by far the best Italian restaurant I have ever been.  I travel very frequently around the United States and South America and up until today South America had the best food, but I have experienced a whole new world at this prime location. Any negative reviews that speaks about how bland the food is or how horrible the service was; didn't have any patience. I cannot remember the name of the pasta dish that I had but it definitely was a spinach ravioli home made, and for dessert the cannoli also made from home. For now on every time I come to Vegas this is my prime restaurant. Obviously during dinner hours it gets pretty busy but be patience with your service it is truly worth the wait.",

Only thing that kept it from a 5 star was coffee service at the end provided by a young woman who seemed put off by bringing hotter coffee.  Strange ending to a really great night.",

Spot-on with recommendations and attentiveness. He worked with a group who made sure our water glasses were never empty, our drinks were full and our questions were answered. We were with a group of 6, so it would be impossible to describe all of our delicious meals but we tasted each one and it was truly perfect. I had a sea bass special which actually made me dance in my seat it was so good and my husband had their classic Oso Bucco (sp) which melted off the bone. From start to finish it was one of the best.. if not THE best meal.. we've had in Vegas and I love the history of the place. They make you feel special and come through with each detail!

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.   There were just a few things that made our meal a little lackluster. This could be preference rather than Piero's fault, but I'll lay it all out regardless.   First off, they only do valet parking. They have no self lot so either Uber there or have a few dollars on hand. Next, they have no cocktail menu. The waiter says order whatever you want and the bartender will make a fine version of it, but he came back with an awful Manhattan and Old Fashioned which tasted just like whiskey dumped into a glass with a random cherry or orange, respectively, as a garnish. Some of the worst renditions of a cocktail I've ever had. Strong but definitely not worthy of a cocktail price. Next thing that happened was that the specials were given before we received our menus and listed about 15 which I couldn't really register as there were too many. It's a little overwhelmed for when you throw out all the specials and don't list prices or ingredient listings or anything.   The food itself was pretty good. The bread was a great French bread and the garbage Caesar salad was a really solid rendition of a Caesar that included tomatoes, avocado, and shrimp (is it even a Caesar salad anymore). This is a great salad and can easily be split or taken as a meal if it's own. The osso bucco was top notch, fall off the bone, deliciousness. It even came with some bone marrow which complimented the French bread perfectly. The side of creamed corn was a nice touch as well. It's sweeter than usual though so beware. The accompanied pasta was just average in the osso bucco dish but you get the dish for the meat not the side so no worries. The mushroom pasta special was very lackluster. Very soft sauce and again the pasta was just fair. The mushrooms were good but there weren't enough and too small to recognize.   Price is pretty steep as well. Most pasta dishes ranged high $20s or low $30s with the meat dishes around high $40s. I think Piero's is one of those romantic locations that you come if you're on a high class vacation or at a convention and on your employer's dollar. But as a destination for the a regular evening out for good Italian in Vegas, it does not even crack the top 10.",

The stone crab claws were delicious but very pricey at $20 each--I wouldn't spring for these every night unless I was independently wealthy but they were very good. I also probably wouldn't order Gentleman Jack at $25 a pop next time either. But here's the deal--it's a great little restaurant with tasty food! If you are splurging (as we were), your bill will not disappoint because you will definitely feel like you splurged! However, if you are on a budget you can also enjoy your night here just pay a little attention to prices (or ask). We'll be back. Loved it!",

    "text": "First off...the food at this place was very good. The service was also very good. It's not located on the main strip so it's not as popular as some other restaurants. Our concierge at the hotel had never heard of it. So for the bad. This place was EXTREMELY overpriced. An order of penne pasta bolognese was $38. Seriously? This was one of the specials that night. I will usually ask the price of a special if its lobster or something that is a market price item. I didn't think I had to for a bowl of pasta. In fact my son ordered the filet mignon and it was $48 (what I'd expect to pay). How is it that a bowl of pasta with meat sauce is $38 and for $10 more you get a 8-10 ounce filet. The other pasta we ordered penne with vodka sauce and prosciutto was $34. I guess you'd say that's kind of high as the prosciutto was nowhere to be seen in the pasta (not even sure there was any in it). House side salad was very tasty. Also, know that they do not do any substitutions. My son who doesn't eat salad asked if he could get something else on the side and they said no. I'm not used to that in s restaurant that charges these prices. This place was re commended to us. However, I would not return nor would I recommend it to anyone else. If you want great food and don't mind overpaying greatly go here. In my opinion there are plenty of places to go as this is Las Vegas. The $38 bowl of pasta with meat sauce really was ridiculous. I do not recommend this place.",

    "text": "I am not sure which was a better day for me; when I finally managed to worm my way into the this institution (took a vacant seat with some friends- hangovers are good when they leave vacancies for me to fill) or when I returned for my 12+ time and felt at ease and at home.   Make no mistake this is a fine dining event. If you want some sauce and starch on the fly there are plenty of food courts to fill your needs. (I won't judge) But if you are discerning and patient, and you believe that performance art can be accomplished by staff in tuxedos, then you MUST experience Piero's. Make reservations though or your night could be a wash.   I write of the restaurant, but plenty of enjoyment can be had at the bar. So don't dismiss it if you desire a top notch drink (absent all the hipster craft ideals). These are beverages to be consumed- not photo flashed off to friends. But the orange slice added to a Basil Hayden does make for beautiful look (props to Brandon Jimenz for making it acceptable for a man to enjoy fruit with a drink).    As for the restaurant itself- brother I could write eight sequels to this review and still miss dozens of points. With brevity in mind let's hit the high bits (if you read this far congrats).  The service is amazing. You will be ushered, questioned, treated, encouraged and thanked. You will not be rushed. So please return the favor and allow the same. As with all art things take time. Sit back and enjoy the sights and sounds without agonizing on whether your next drink will make it to the table (it is likely prepared for you before you even know you need it- the soothsaying is gratis). The waiters (there must be a better word for their professional magic) are magnificent. They direct you through the evening with aplomb. I always leave as feeling as I dined with a group of friends.   The food is without equal. The menu has normal fair- done with unique flourishes- and some outstanding high notes.   The Stone Crab must be ordered.  Get the Garbage Cesar. (extra points if you can be True and eat it after the main course) Select your preference for pasta. Have someone else order Osso Bucco. Sample the dessert.  (And repeat)  Basically you cannot go wrong with your food choices. I have friends ready to take aim if I disparage the Kosher chicken. Others never shut up about the eggplant. (fine, the others are me. I can admit it). The steaks have yet to meet an urban cowboy who doesn't wish they had room to order another one. Order away and know that you can choose your own adventure here- but there are no wrong turns- just new outposts along the way.   A moment to address some elephants- please don't talk incessantly about \"the movie\". Please don't act like anyone in a suit is connected. Know that the more time you spend craning your next for a celebrity subtracts from the time you have to enjoy all the other colorful characters that make this place special. Yes, celebrities come here, but only those with taste. Shouldn't we allow the tasteful some respite from flashbulbs and handshakes? (Side note, the staff makes YOU feel like a celebrity- so act accordingly and maybe people will start watching you instead.)  I love this place nearly as much as I love this town. And with time they have become so intertwined that no force could separate the two. Do yourself a favor and experience on your own. I look forward to reading your reviews.",

The pasta however was a bit bland and sauce was watery (was the fettuccine with broccoli, mushrooms, cream and a touch of tomato). The wait staff was great and very attentive and knowledgeable.  I was very surprised however to go to a fine dinning establishment and be sat in front of a bar with a wall full of TV screens.  I had noted on the reservation it was our anniversary and thought we would be sat in a more romantic location, did not think there would be TV's like a sports bar.  The server surprised us with a delicious large slice of chocolate cake that was light and very good.",

I yelped a good Italian place to eat and this placed looked promising.  People were saying a must stop authentic Italian and great food and bla bla bla.   Well.  I have to say get dressed up before you go here and make sure you bring valet $. And a fat pocket book because just for fettuccini noodles it's 30$ and totally not worth the price. the wifes clam and noodles was 40$ it was ok. and to add chicken to mine was another 11$ I have to say. Bucca is way better for the entertainment and the price.  Won't be back here again.  If money is no concern I'm sure the 50-75$ plates are better then what we got.  Total bill 140$ for three people, no appetizers and one beer and one ice tea.",

We were seated at a booth, had a few cocktails, calamari appetizer was excellent.  I had the garbage Caesar and it was one of the best salads I've ever had.  My partner had the standard Caesar and enjoyed it as well.  I had the rigatoni bolognese and he had the scampi, again, both were excellent.  We finished with a small chocolate topped puff pastry (2 per order- can't remember name) and coffee.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food and will definitely return.

I thought the service was excellent until I realized we had been sitting there for over 2 hours and been served 3 bottles of wine and still hadn't been brought our food. When we asked the waiter he said our salad would be right out. 45 minutes later still no salad. I left. I have to work this morning. My husband and friend stayed for dinner. I spoke with the matri de on the way out, expressing my concern. I drove thru In-N-Out on the way home. I called the manager to express my concern that my party was being over served without food. She was dismissive.Said she would look into it and I could call back to check on it or give my contact info and they would call me back. I was passed off from the manager and rudely asked for my info. When I gave it to her she admitted she didn't even have a pen to take down my info. I really wish Ralph Lamb, Tony Spilattro and Lefty Rosenthal were still alive. This poor service didn't happen when they were running Las Vegas... ;/",

This restaurant is very dimly lit and classy looking, plus it was bustling with people on a Monday night so that was a good sign.   I had a caesar salad and the pasta special: rigatoni bolognese.   The salad was very good but I was all about the pasta, which was absolutely perfect. I had been in the mood for exactly this too and was a little disheartened to not see anything like it on the menu. Luckily when our waiter mentioned the specials there it was...  Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. Lots of beef and tons of flavor, it totally hit the spot.   Service was wonderful and very attentive, they always brought more bread when requested and my water was never empty. They even came by to brush crumbs off the table which always seems like an extra special thing to do at any restaurant.   I would certainly come back to this place and recommend it to friends that are visiting Las Vegas.",

The food was boring and not worth the price. I had their signature dish, the Ossobuco. To me, it tasted like a pot roast you'd get at Denny's. Nothing special about it at all. Really very similar to pot roast. The pasta and sauce was also \"whatever.\" Nothing at all was very tasty or special about the meal. My wife had a chicken dish with cheese and egg plant (can't remember the exact name), but that too was ok. Nothing great. I would say if the meal was $20 each it would be worth it but $50 per dish should be an excellent meal. Not too pleased and wouldn't go back.",

We had 2 Ossobuco and I fish dinner, all were very good and the Ossobuco was on point! We had a Chocolate Mousse cake also that was ok. My only complaint is with the service, speaking clearly is key to welcoming and connecting with customer and it was missing. I'd go back again for food.",

The food is extremely over priced and it was not just bad but horrible. The salmon entre was over 50 dollars and it was dry and tasteless. They didn't cook it they punished it. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Just terrible.",

    "text": "Picture this:  Day 2 of a full day of \"Magic: The Gathering\" Grand Prix tournament at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  9:30 at night, no car, one very tired and hungry 11 year old.  I turn to Yelp for help....Piero's looks like my kind of place, but will they mind a kid, or the fact that we are dressed in shorts and t-shirts?  I call ahead and speak to a very kind maitre d, who assure me that it won't matter to them how we are dressed, they will have a table for us.  True enough, we arrive exhausted, in need of food and wine, and dressed at least 10 levels below the rest of the patrons, not to mention the wait staff.  Maitre d doesn't blink an eye, simply finds us a suitable booth and welcomes us to Vegas.  He was awesome!  Now for the important stuff:  food and service.  I'd love to say that for the price of this meal we were treated to 5-star service and the most amazing Italian fare outside of Tuscany.  In fact, other than the very prompt delivery of bread (hot and tasty, by the way) service was quite slow.  It took at least 20 minutes for our waiter to check in with us and deliver menus, and another 5-10 to get our wine order.  I know that this is not a \"fast food casual\" restaurant, but this delay had nothing to do with pacing -  we were simply forgotten!  On the plus side, the restaurant does offer half orders of pasta, which was the perfect solution for the kiddo.  The bolognese was quite tasty, as was the my tomato/cream based pasta dish with veggies.  Salads?  Not so great.  The greens might have been crisp originally, but once they were coated with the very thick house dressing, that crispness disappeared and we were faced with a limp pile of veggies.  Sad.  Cons: overpriced, rather ordinary food; slow service Fros: right across from the convention center; close to our hotel; welcoming to all comers, even the under-dressed",

The Osso Bucco was amazing, with the meat falling off the bone, tender, juicy, flavorful, and the bone marrow balanced well with the red wine that I had.

    "text": "Valentines day dinner, Not so great *shrug emoji  So many questions to be answered. First off, reservation was at 8pm. We arrived at 8pm and did not get seated until 8:45pm. If I knew we were going to have to wait almost an hour, my boyfriend and I would've just gone to any restaurant as a \"drop in\" without reservations to wait. We had reservations and were not sure as to why we waited so long. Perhaps the restaurant overbooked? The hostess kept walking past us without saying a word or even acknowledging we were sitting there, waiting. It wasn't until I stopped the guy at the front and asked him how much longer. We were about to leave and walk out but they seated us after that. What I didn't really understand either was that there were several other people who walked in the door after us, but got seated before us... For example, It seemed like this couple knew someone working there (or must be a regular) because they were talking to some workers as if they knew each other. Who knows, but extremely unprofessional, guess you have to know people to get seated quickly.  They finally seated us, and the booth had food crumbs all over the seat, I wiped it down for them. The waiter seemed like he was extremely busy and it took a while to get our order in. My plate was good and my boyfriend liked his, so theres no complaint on food. Check for 2 was around $180. I just felt that the waiters were overworked and seemed very busy that they just had a hard time keeping up. We ended up leaving the restaurant at 10:20ish..... We were pretty upset.  Additionally, the restaurant was giving out roses to all the women due to it being valentines day, I DIDN'T GET ONE lol. I was like, OK thanks!! I just thought it was so rude because every single women in there had one and I didn't know why I was the only one who didn't. Just little things like this sometimes can have a huge impact on a customer. If you're going to be handing out goodies, make sure you are consistent about it.  Seems like whomever is managing this place is not doing a good job. Just my observation. My boyfriend and I try out new places all the time and we can say with certainty that this will not be someplace where we will be spending money on again. I'm just glad that we didn't let this restaurant ruin our valentines day, we still had a great time because of our own company.",

    "text": "This is the place to be for excellent Italian food. Located on convention center drive, only valet parking is available. This was the first time I used yelp reservations and it was amazing!  You are started off with warm bread and butter. We ordered their agnolotti pasta with cream which was almost like a light spinach filled ravioli, fettuccine alfredo and House special veal chop Parmesan. The pasta and entree comes with house salad. Their pasta is priced between $28-$36 and entree Veal Parmesan was $50. It's a pricy place but the food was excellent. Wine options were good with bottles of wine starting at $45.  For dessert we had their chocolate rum cake which was one of the best I ever had. Light and moist, yummmy!  The reason for bumping a star was that the experience dampened after we were served dessert. Our waitress forgot about us and we sat 30 mins just waiting for her to box the dessert and get our check. Finally asked one of the food runners to locate her. Another unpleasant surprise was our check. We were charged $36 for fettuccine alfredo which was listed at $29. I brought it to my server's attention and she argued that it was $36 on the menu. I had her bring me the menu to verify and of course it was $29. She took it to the manager to get it fixed. My total came to $187. However my card gets charged for $207... REALLY?? So I had to call her again to correct that.. she did some research and told me that the manager accidentally charged for a salmon dish that I never ordered. So finally I had my check all corrected.  My piece of advice to fellow yelpers, ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK YOUR CHECK!!",

It was a busy night I will give him that but he said he could seat us shortly we told him we would wait in the bar and an hour went by and he never came to get us. He was not very friendly when we got there and seemed overwhelmed. As expected in Las Vegas the price is too highFor the food but this is a real old-school Italian restaurant and the food is excellent. This is a very interesting place with all time and service the way it was decades ago.

    "text": "I travel to Vegas nearly every week for work, have for years and this is my first Yelp review.  I have eaten at Pieros probably 100 times over the past few years. I eat there solo, I entertain clients and I've brought my family.  There is good reason I've eaten at Pieros 100 times - there is simply no reason to eat anywhere else for me. It is that good here.  The diversity and quality of their menu is amazing. Got a meat fix? Eat the veal chop parmesan, blackened ribeye or osso bucco.  Want perfectly cooked seafood? Sea bass, halibut and swordfish are among the best I've ever had.  Special occasion? Splurge for a 25 year MacCallan or Louis XIII.    Let's talk about service:  from the leadership at the restaurant  (Evan and Pat) to the Captains (Philippe, Patrick and Tim) and the bartenders  (Heather and Bruce) and the front desk (Anton) it is very clear that there is a culture of service, warmth towards customers and attention to detail that you will seldom find in other restaurants.  There is real passion and authenticity  among all the Piero's team and it shows, day in and day out as if it's the last performance they will ever give.  That is incredibly hard to do in any kind of service profession.  In Vegas, the cityscape gets torn down and rebuilt seemingly every decade, but Piero's persists and thrives off the strip and does it with timeless style.  Go here, eat here, drink here, chit chat with the staff and absorb what will be an enriching dining experience.  -Mark  P.S. I think Freddie actually recognizes and acknowledges me now, so I am finally making progress!",

The service was fantastic with our water glasses never going to even half empty.   My party had the beefsteak tomato and burrata appetizer. The burrata was super creamy. For dinner we had the fettuccini Alfredo, spaghetti pomodoro, linguini bolognese, and rigatoni bolognese.   It's pricey but very worth it. And, if you have kids, you can order half portions.   The next time in Vegas we'll be back!",

To me, it wasn't so much Rat-Pack-y as it was '80s Vegas -- more precisely, Golden-Girls-Go-To-Vegas: pastels on the wall, lots of beige, smell of Geritol in the air, old-school food and drink, Pia Zadora (!!!) playing in the lounge. FABULOUS!   As mentioned, I don't care much for Italian food, but what I had here was excellent: prosciutto & melon appetizer, \"garbage\" Caesar salad and osso bucco. Bonus: this is one of the few spots I don't feel out of place ordering a Campari & soda, so I had two of those, as well!   The prices are a bit steep, but just do as I did and have a fast-talking name-dropping deal-making TV producer/pornographer take you. Problem solved!  To be honest, because of this place's pedigree, I was expecting a bit more mob shtick here. But rather than be disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised by the weird 80s grandma vibe. Let's be real, Rat Pack-era Vegas is played out anyway -- 80s Vegas is the new 60s Vegas!",

    "text": "We had early evening reservations for a group of 4 on Tuesday of this week. We were seated at a table in the bar area where it's a bit noisy but convivial, especially the one chick grinding on her boyfriend's lap at the bar. Group orders cocktails, appetizers, salad, 4 entrees, a bottle of wine, dessert. Service and alcohol are wonderful; food mostly bland except for the veal chop parmesian, which was excellent. The service has been paced perfectly: no long waits between courses and no courses overlapping. Group has just finished dessert and has paid the bill -- a mere $600 -- and two of the group are slurping up the last of the wine. Older dude (I'd generally use the more respectful \"gentleman\" but it doesn't apply in this case) comes over and says, \"It's time for you to leave. You've been here long enough.\" Group looks up and thinks he's being funny. Nope. Crabby dude says, \"I'm serious. I'm the manager here and I need this table.\" Group looks around. There are two empty tables next to us.   Most of us are fairly cosmopolitan and have eaten at swanky places all over the world, but never, repeat, never has anything so uncouth and rude happened to us in a supposedly classy but definitely expensive joint. We could certainly understand if the four of us had been loud and obnoxious or rude or cheap or spent an extra hour dawdling after we'd finished our meals. And even then we would have expected the manager to say something like, \"Hey, I'm sorry but we need this table for a large group. What if you head over to the bar and I'll buy you a drink?\" The woman who had treated us was not only livid, but embarrassed, and she dashed out of the restaurant. Two of us were slower and a different manager came up to apologize for the old man, saying that had happened a few times that week. What? We then made our way through the throngs of people waiting to be seated -- oh, sorry, there were only about 4 people standing in the lobby.  So, a fun evening with friends was soured for no reason whatsoever. Plus I had to use up time which could be spent on better things writing this because I could never forgive myself if I didn't. For the record, the dishes I classified as bland were the mussels (puny mussels in broth not even interesting enough to dip bread in -- if you're into mussels, try the green mussels from New Zealand served at The Barrymore up the street), the shrimp appetizers, the garbage salad and the Osso Bucco, which was tender but didn't taste much different than mom's pot roast.",

Our waiter Joseph was a kick he was full of information and gave us great service. All the employees here wear jackets or vests with their names embroidered on them I  it ! Joseph suggested he fancy up my Veal Picatta and my sisters Veal Parm - oh boy did he instead of medallions we were served bone in vela shanks that had been butterflied. Seriously tender and delicious. The Veal Parm was probably hate best I've ever had - you could smell the red sauce when you came in the front door and it didn't disappoint on the plate. My husband got the blackened steak bone in and it was unbelievably juicy and flavorful. I can't tell you a bad thing about this place I loved everything we ate I loved the staff and the ambiance.

    "text": "I don't know what other reviewers are complaining about with this place. Parking is valet-only here, so suck it up and thank the valet guy with a tip. Or if you're from out of town, take a taxi from your hotel. Both times I have been here the service has been excellent. Saw Pia Zadora on a Saturday night. Pia's husband went out of his way to ensure we had seats at the bar, bringing in additional seats to accommodate us. Bartenders are great and Pia is fabulous.   A couple weeks later I took some visiting guests for dinner late on a Sunday night (last night). I called ahead to check availability and when we arrived we were seated immediately and the service was excellent again. The waiter was great. We all chose different entrees and everything was excellent. Previously I have heard/read complaints that Piero's food is Olive Garden quality but that is simply not the case. Piero's food is excellent and exactly what one would expect from a high end Italian restaurant. I had the Osso Bucco and it was to die for. My friends were thrilled with their meals as well, and said they will make Piero's a regular part of their Vegas trips from now on.   I suspect those who complain about Piero's are either cheap or just not used to real high end dining. FYI, most of the restaurants on the strip aren't exactly True high end. They may offer good food and \"fancy\" environs but they are still just another overpriced cattle call to appeal to the masses who want to see and be seen as \"living it up\". Piero's is exceptional.   I will most definitely be back.",

It was tender, very flavorful & had the perfect amount of pink in the middle.   If your looking for a good place for steak or veal in Vegas, this is a definite place to go to. It's totally worth it & I left full! It's also where they filmed the movie Casino with Deniero. One of my top 3 gangster movies!",

But I'm completely blown away that somebody who owns a restaurant like this would allow such a foul bathroom in their establishment. Went in to wash our hands and bathroom was dirty, run down, smelled, toilets full and the fixture on the sink to wash your hands was not mounted on the counter and just about to fall off. Take $5000 and redo your bathroom!!! It's a complete no brainer. We were all shocked as we left that the owner has not dealt with this. Otherwise, everything else was great.",

    "text": "This is between a 2 and a 3 star experience, but for how expensive it is in relation to the quality, I may say this deserves 1 star.  With so many great options in Las Vegas, you need to go somewhere else, trust me.  The food was average to below, three stars or less.  My table started with calamari, a shrimp dish and fried mozzarella.   Everything was decent, not great.  Our entire table had salads.  I ordered the tomato salad with burrada, on arugula, the tomato was like a desert rock, not ripe at all.  The bursts and sauce were solid, the tomato should not have been served.   There Cesar they called the garbage Cesar because they put everything in it.   But it truly is garbage.  For the main plate I had halibut.   It was overlooked and I didn't finish the plate.  The best plate there was a veal and pasta plate that was served with bone marrow, which is the special of the chef, it was excellent.   Except for the veal Everything was average, and for the price that isn't acceptable.  Finally, the service was so so so slow.   Dinner started at 7:30, a few of the party was late, so maybe 7:45.   Dinner wasn't served until 10:40, it was so slow!  You are in Vegas, choose a better joint!",

    "text": "Unequivocally recommended. One of the last strongholds of vintage Vegas. Super-solid quality of product and truly fawning service inside a Mid-Century-classic luxurious decor. This venue has been a local's top-pick time and time again, including by legendary Mayor Oscar Goodman, as recommendation to recapture old-school Vegas ... as well as Vegas' best Italian restaurant from a poll of local cabbies. Given Piero's is seen as knocking-out all the opulent Italian dining available across all the casino properties, well, that says it all.   Over the years, Piero's has been dined by thousands of celebrities, the famous ... and the infamous. The list of such, should you research it, is literally endless. On one visit, our server advised we had just missed Nicolas Cage & Carrot Top as patrons. That duo sounded unlikely as wing-buddies ... but the next day the RJ gossip column confirmed it. (Piero's staff is apparently quite meticulous about protecting the privacy of such patrons from gawkers, autographers and the like.)  I've dined Piero's several times, always with a lovely lady companion who deserves the experience. And I always end up ordering the Chicken Vesuvius, given it's rumored that Frank Sinatra would occasionally send his jet up from Palm Springs to order-out ... way-out ... for a plate of it. If it so impressed Ol' Blue Eyes, well ... (Apparently, he also favored the linguine and clams here as well.)  Piero's has tons of additional backstory. This is the second venue for this restaurant; the first opened in 1982. This second venue was previously operated as Villa D'Este, owned & run by Joe Pigatello. Back in those days, Pigatello's joint was frequented by certain wiseguys, including Tony Spilotro. So it's quite fitting that this space was showcased by several scenes within the Martin Scorsese 1995 film \"Casino,\" in which Joe Pesce portrays Spilotro (incorrectly) as its owner.  (As Piero's, it is owned & run by the Glusman family.) There's a scene in the film where Robert DiNiro & Sharon Stone argue in a corner booth (over her tying their child up to their bed with pantyhose so she can go sleaze up to Pesce). That booth - not surprisingly called 'The Casino Booth' - is currently quite available for seating (though it sports new leathering) and it provides a very nice view of one section of the venue and the main bar. (I've tipped into it before, finding my companion, once so informed of such history, was quite impressed.)   There was a time that Wayne Newton called Piero's his favorite dining haunt ... and from time to time Piero's would be re-opened after closing ... and after Newton finished his last show of the evening ... just for Newton and his entourage. In 2012, when San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos was looking for a new head coach, he held the interviews over dinner at Piero's. Then there's the story about Bob Stupak, one of Vegas' back-in-the-day legendary characters/hucksters, who conceived and built The Stratosphere & its Tower; at the time the property was named \"Bob Stupak's Vegas World.\" Stupak, a poker addict, had a beef with Binion's (a Downtown/Fremont casino) over the millions in chips he had stashed in Binion's vault, a beef that culminated in a couple of tough guys ruining Stupak's dinner at Piero's -- with a beating. In classic Vegas tradition, almost none of Piero's staff remembered seeing anything. Currently, Piero's Lounge has been instrumental in reviving the career of none-other than Pia Zadora. If you aren't old enough to remember of Ms. Zadora, I'll leave it to you to check with Dr. Google about that. If you dine here on a weekend, don't be surprised if she table-touches you for a bit of a chat, as she has done at our table.  If all that history, aside all the five-star plates and service, doesn't cause to you to crave a dining experience at Piero's, well you just don't know how to appreciate what Vegas is really all about!",

    "text": "I have long wanted to eat at this purveyor of classic Italian food with an \"Old School\" Las Vegas vibe and a longstanding reputation for memorable dining.  Now that I finally have, I am pleased to report that my high expectations were exceeded.    We had 6:00 p.m. reservations, and, when all Las Vegas Convention Center lots were full at 3:45 p.m., restaurant management was kind enough to permit us to park here without charge.  Normally it is valet parking only.  When we returned from the Las Vegas Jewelry & Watch Show, Diane and I were quickly shown to our requested booth, and soon enjoyed a starter of cheesy and gooey Mozzarella Fritta with thin and spicy Marinara Sauce, along with exceptional crusty Italian bread and butter.  By the end of the meal, we (mostly me) had collectively consumed almost two entire loaves.   A House Salad with fresh tomato, carrots, Green Bell Peppers, Red Onion, Iceberg Lettuce, and a light Italian Dressing was cool and refreshing, and a half Garbage Caesar Salad with Romaine Lettuce, tomato, a generous amount of avocado, croutons, Hearts of Palm, and large chunks of tasty shrimp was even more delectable.  I wanted to sample the Verdure e Legumi in Brodo, so I requested a half order.  When the so-called cup of soup arrived, I was shocked to see that the white lion-headed crock containing the hot liquid would have qualified as a bowl almost everywhere else.  But not here!  After being on the lookout for a bowl, I finally found one being carried through the dining room by a server.  And it was a huge white ceramic tureen covered by a plate.  As good as the soup was, I was glad that I only had to face a half order.  Filled with cauliflower, spinach, carrot spears, celery, vermicilli, mushrooms, and a very tasty vegetable broth, the soup was simply great.  The chef then surprised us by sending out from the kitchen complimentary Creamed Corn Au Gratin with Parmesan Cheese, which was sweet and creamy.  But nothing overshadowed my delicious signature dish entree of tender, falling off the bone Osso Bucco: a perfectly prepared slow-cooked veal shank mingling with a light tomatoey sauce and al dente fettuccine.  Meanwhile Diane greatly enjoyed her main of Veal Scaloppine Parmigiana topped by requested homemade Alfredo Sauce, and accompanied by splendid Roasted Potatoes.       A dessert tray then beckoned with several tantalizing treats.  But, since Diane is allergic to berries, we had to turn back a chosen Cream Puff when we saw that it contained pieces of strawberry inside.  With sincerely expressed apologies, a slice of Carrot Cake with Coconut-Flaked Cream Cheese Frosting was quickly presented as a suitable replacement, for which we were not charged even though I was quite willing and poised to pay for everything we ate.  There was no reason for any restaurant employee to know of Diane's allergy.  Service from our highly competent waiter John Y. and his able assistants was on point all evening, with unbidden water refills, and requests for more bread and butter quickly accommodated.  Our booth was very comfortable, and, despite a bustling dining room, the ambiance was somewhat romantic with dimmed lights overhead.  I will surely return for more fine Italian cuisine and hospitality.",

    "text": "Went with my wife, sister, brother in law and family friends on Saturday August 4th (8pm reservation) for a combination birthday dinner/anniversary. Post event, have now added Pieros as a \"absolute go to\" every tme we are in Las Vegas.   The two gentlemen out front - professional, funny, gave good overview of restaurant since we had never been there, and provided great service.   Gentleman at front area who greeted us - personable, showed us to the bar, made us feel right at home.   Nancy the bartender - once again, took care of us, made us feel at home, excellent mixologist, personable.   Once my sister and her brother in law arrived, the event only became BETTER. We were very fortunate to be seated right behind the bar at a great table for the six of us.   Sidenote: If I lived in Las Vegas (we are from Seattle) this would be a mainstay for watching MNF, as there are 4 unobstrusive big screens up above the bar.   Billy, who was the primary person who took care of us for dinner, did a great job of explaining a litte about Pieros (per my request), the food, and some recommendations for the evening.   The appetizers were amazing - the calimari, and especially the fried cheese were delicious as my favorites of the ones brought out.   For the entree, I took Billys recommendation and ordered the pounded out veal parmesan, and it was the best culinary decision I have made in quite some time. It was the best serving of veal I have had in my adult life - bar none.   During our entire meal, the entire staff at Pieros was there, but not there, as everything our table needed was provided seamlessly.   Drinks were replaced without asking, cutlery magically showed up when needed, and all done with the understated elegeance of an establishment that knows how to take care of its customers.   I cannot state how appreciative  I am for our visit to Pieros and the service we received - I would recommend Pieros to ANYONE looking to have a world class experience - the food, ambiance, and underlying feeling of the place is truly AWESOME.   Thank you PIEROS (all members of the TEAM we interacted with), as you gave my wife and I a memory that will truly last a lifetime!  Tim OBrien  Seattle, WA",

    "text": "We're always looking for a restaurant to get out of the hotel \"rut\" while in Vegas and Piero's is always st the top of my list. A gem of a restaurant far enough off the strip to feel like you've escaped but close enough where the cab/Uber ride is easy enough. The service is first rate, very professional, seems like they've all worked there for years, and the food - oh, the food! Authentic Italian at its finest! The crab claws as an appetizer will blow you away. You have to have room for the saltimbocca because it's huge. The veal is delicious - it's ALL delicious! If you have any room left, they have an excellent dessert selection, but I've never made it that far. An excellent wine selection... can't say enough about Piero's. Check it out, you'll be glad you got outside and leave the hotel restaurants for everyone else!",

We had the in season stone crab claws, garbage Caesar salad, ribeye, roasted corn, mashed potatoes, Rapture wine, dirty martini, and Canolis.  Our maitre'd, server, and bus help were all extraordinary. In particular I complimented them on having excellent diction, making reciting the dishes sound especially enticing, and being that English was not their first language.  They were delightful and presented the dishes very well.  I'm happy they took my feedback, and implemented changes, and gave me a second impression.",

We've been here many times and after the last time we went there, I can truly say I've seen the ultimate downfall of this restaurant and we will never go back.   The food is hit or miss. Sometimes it has been good (never great) but again, as of late, it's been mediocre at best. In the past, the ambience and venue made up for only \"good\" food... Not anymore.   Cold artichokes, frozen seafood, bland sauces... I'll pay top dollar for food- if it's worth it. However, the food has become nothing more than Olive Garden quality at an insane price.   I will say, the waiters and bartenders are friendly and attentive, however the owner is a rude old man who does not understand customer service and has a huge sense of entitlement. Just because your restaurant has been around for over 30 years does not mean that it will survive 30 more. Based on their Friday night crowd, I'd be surprised if it lasts more than 2 more years.  Truly disappointing that this place has turned into a joke.",

If you want the best Prime Rib, be sure and call ahead to order since it must be requested beforehand. When I say this is not only wonderful food, but a historical experience with the following of many greats who have visited this Old School Top Notch experience such as its previous customer list...Steve Allen, Yogi Berra, Diahann Carroll, Dick Clark, Pat Cooper, Vic Damone, Sammy Davis, Jr., Robert DeNiro, Eddie Fisher, Elizabeth Taylor, Tippi Hendren, Mick Jaggar, Jack Klugman, Tony LaRussia, Steve Lawrence, Jerry Lewis, Rich Little,Roddy McDowell, The McGuire Sisters, Ed McMahon, Jayne Meadows, Floyd Mayweather, Joe Namath, Arnold Palmer, Robert Redford, Debbie Reynolds, Don Rickles, Carlos Santana, Frank Sinatra.....etc,., etc,,, etc! And this is just a handful of names who enjoyed this great place. It supercedes time! If you really want to do the night right, dine here and afterwards see The Rat Pack and you will truly feel the total 50's/60's experience! ENJOY",

I especially liked one of the specials- spinach stuffed ravioli in alfredo.  And they brought a side of sweet cream corn even though we didn't order it, it was really yummy.  Great bread, extensive wine selection, friendly and attentive service.  I liked that we got there early for a drink in the bar.  Big and strong martinis, Prosecco- yum, dark and comfortable, what I'd imagine a Vegas bar was like in the 60s.  They actually have two bars, look pretty much the same.

Here is what we ordered:  -glasses of prosecco -proscuitto and melon -\"garbage\" (Piero's connotation, not mine) caesar salad (meaning it has alot of ingredients in it: avocado, shrimp, etc.) -house salad -fettucine alfredo -veal osso bucco (also comes with a side of fettucine noodles in the osso bucco sauce)  Everything was delicious, especially the veal osso bucco. You definitely don't need a knife. Service was spot-on.

I received a call from the restaurant as a result of my review, which I didn't expect.  The GM was apoplectic and offered to have me and guests come in for another try.  That try was last night.  I have to say, it was back to what I expected.  The service was excellent, the food cooked as we expected, the staff polite.  It was everything I expected when I went in several times before!    Thank you to management for doing what was right.  They cared about the customer enough to do this.  I have experience in the restaurant field and I know it is often impossible to find young people to do the right things and to see the big picture.  This place will always be busy due to it's great location, but Vegas has a lot of competition and they certainly can get a larger piece if they continue to have great food and service.  I'm a fan again.  The food was great, and the service as well.  I will be full for days, but will be back.",

Then, the food was below average. I got the salmon. It was bland and definitely tasted frozen. When I ate the inside part of it, it had a watery texture and tasted like nothing. The vegetables that came with it were also bland. For 40 bucks, it was a waste of money and a disappointment, and I've had much better salmon at a far lower price. On the plus side, I liked the music part of it. It was nice Pia Zadora came to our table to greet us. The other singers were good. I hope that the little girl that took us to our seat wasn't in violation of child labor laws. Although she's cute and probably appeals to customers, she shouldn't be put to work at that age.",

We pulled up and were required to use the valet for their own parking lot located on sight. My car was literally fifty feet from the front door, that's irritating. I guess some would see this as classy, but I see valet as something to use when you have to park far away. We go in and are seated and we do not receive a drink menu or food menu for almost ten minutes. Things were not starting out well. Luckily we waited it out because I was ready to leave. We started getting our food and that's where things finally turned around.  We split the Garbage Caesar Salad and it was seriously one of the best Ceasar Salad's I've ever had. The extra things in the salad like avocado, heart of palm & huge chunks of shrimp really worked... I'm stealing this when I make mine at home! I had the Veal Piccata for dinner and my husband had the Osso Buco. Both were very good and more food than we could possibly eat. If you are looking for a slow pace old school Italian dinner then this is your place, but if you are trying to hurry off to a show.....maybe not.",

A lot of scenes from the movie Casino was filmed there and I'm sure that the mob has eaten here at one point haha.   I've been here 4 or 5 times and every dining experience was phenomenal! I don't think I've ever looked at their menu because I've only ever ordered off the verbal specials. My boyfriend and I almost always order the Garbage Caesar Salad,  Osso Buco, and the Bone-in Veal Parmesan. Once you have the garbage Caesar salad, every other salad comes second. This is the best Caesar salad ever! They have somehow made a simple salad taste exceptional. The Osso Buco has been a house specialty for forever now! The meat is always so tender and the bone marrow is always a delightful treat. The Veal Parmesan is so yummy and just melts in your mouth. It's really flavorful!   It's definitely a fancy pansy place but they don't have have artfully plated dishes. What's more important? Food that looks good or food that taste good? Definitely food that tastes good! I'll definitely keep coming here for years to come and I will recommend this restaurant over and over again!   Other than the great food, the service is also outstanding so go try this place out!",

This place has been around for a long time and unlike a lot of food on the strip it is high quality.  This place isn't cheap so don't come on a budget.  I went with the veal parmigan and was very pleased with the flavor and quantity of food.  Our party's gripe was the service.  It started out good but we felt ignored as more tables filled up.  We finally had to ask for our check after being done eating for 30 minutes.  If our drinks had been refilled during that time do wouldn't have minded but we felt forgotten",

    "text": "Piero's has become our new favorite restaurant when visiting Vegas. Each trip, we make a reservation a few weeks out and plan for a night of great food and drink.   Upon arriving, the maitre'd was unable to find our reservation. However, unlike the experience we had at El Dorado Cantina, he was able to seat us and ensured it would not be a problem.  The restaurant has a classy feel while embodying that \"mafia\" Vegas feel without the gimmick. You just feel like you're dining in a nice Italian restaurant that doesn't have to even try to be cool--it just is cool. The serving star is extremely attentive, personable and always knows the extensive menu and specials like the back of their hand.   I have an issue branching out here...I always order the \"Garbage\" Caesar Salad as a started and the Osso Buco for a main. The Garbage Caesar is you standard Caesar salad but with the addition of shrimp, avocado and hearts of palm. The combination is really tasty and livens up an otherwise traditional salad. The Osso Buco isn't on the menu but is arguably the restaurant's number one seller. The shank is braised for 6 hours until tender and served along side a nest of fettuccine. What I love about their Osso Buco is the size of the shank -- it's huge, which means a lot of buttery marrow to go with it.   If you're craving fabulous Italian food, I definitely recommend Piero's.",

Jerry who is local whom has just lost his wife to lung cancer, and the maitre de  who is awesome as well.  They pour fantastically heavy drinks, and they pay extraordinary attention to you.  The next time I visit I feel that I will be visiting longtime friends and catching up with people whom I care about.  It's a wonderful experience that I very much look forward to again.  Be sure to tip the gentleman at the front with the bow tie something extra, he works for it.",

Stay and see Pia Zadora's show at PIA'S PLACE at 9:00 p.m. I would be seated by 8:30 p.m. to get comfortable and enjoy the band. Her signature drink is a twist on the martini and it's adorably called the Piatini. Don't be fooled by the cute name as they kick. You simply must try, as they kick ass and are delicious! You will be entertained from the moment she appears to the last note of song. Her classically trained voice is going to deliver an enchanting evening of delightful song and dance and witty comedy. Also both local celebrities and visiting celebs often attend this show. You never know who may show. One time there were three different stars in attendance and Pia is always gracias enough to ask them to perform. In fact I can't remember ever being there when there wasn't at least one celeb present. Sometimes you are seated directly next to them and get to chit chat with them too. Either way there is not a bad seat in the room. The band is terrific. Pia is looking cuter than ever and I personally qurantee you that it will be an enchanting evening.  Stuart Lewis of Las Vegas",

The hostess appeared overwhelmed and the manager stressed out and poor at accommodating customers. Will not give this place another chance, it was so unspectacular.

But no need to worry that they're resting on the service alone. The food was delish. The osso bucco, recommended by another patron and mentioned as a specialty by the old school waiter, was fantabulous -- melt in your mouth goodness and served with a small fork for digging out the marrow. We also got a lovely salad, some calamari (which would not have travelled well at all) and a side of creamed corn (with bacon). Every item was well prepared, rich, and big enough to share amongst a group. My companion and I had way more food than we could handle, but I scraped every last bit of that marrow out, let me tell you. We also paid through the nose...but for large dishes! It seems to be the norm in Vegas, but my Cali sensibilities say I would like options for half orders (not a complaint against Piero's -- just an observation on the restaurants in the area).  I would have gone back if they'd been open for lunch. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll try them again and probably bump up my rating to a full 5stars. P.S. if you're attending a convention at the LVH (what a dump), this is a good off-site but still nearby option for dinner.",

During our visit to Las Vegas last week we returned.  A table of 6, entrees all around, two bottles of wine.  The food was excellent and served on time.  The service however was very poor.  Water glasses went unfilled half way through the meal.  Found out when we received the bill that rather than ask \"bottled water or tap\" they poured bottled and tried to stick us with the $11 up charge.  I had to call the watier back after our appetizers arrived to order the first bottle of wine.  I ordered the second when the entrees arrived.  Bottom line the food is still 4 to 5 stars but the service on our recent visit was 2 star, thus the rating.",

The  prosciutto with melon was a nice light start,  The signature salad was absolutely delicious followed by their famous Osso buoco, very tender and a nice light flavorful sauce.  The veal Milanese was crispy onthe outside and a flavorful tender inside you didn't even need a knife. The deserts ...cheesecake was excellent as was the creme  bule.  Overall this Italian restaurant is a great alternative off the strip, my only suggestion.... You need to have a meatball appitizer on your menu...Really!

    "text": "For some reason, I felt skeptical despite the good reviews here, but my brother (in from Los Angeles) wanted to go and since he'd picked such a great restaurant (The Capital Grille) the day before, I allowed it instead of following my gut.  First, the place is butt ugly. I don't think anything has changed in their in 20 years and in this case, that is not a good thing. Tacky paintings. Bad lighting. Okay whatever.  Service was slow but I'm thinking maybe it's relaxing and not slow. My lemondrop was sour but it tasted of fresh lemon so that was okay. I had a craving for anchovies and asked to have them added to my salad. They brought me a big plate and that was nice because the salad was lacking in flavor, so the anchovy turned out to be helpful.  Slowly on to the main course...I ordered an osso bucco that was supposed to be their house specialty. It's braised all day and served in a red wine reduction.  But while waiting for the food, I'm realizing that the heat is becoming stifling. I ask the waiter and he says the a/c has failed. (Uh, it's 105 degrees outside, if you have no air, maybe you need to shut down.) He asks about moving but since no one else at my table seems to be complaining and we've already had our salads, I say no. (I should have said yes.) They bring a fan out and it does help a bit.  It turns out the air was out in one dining room. There is a second dining room where it's on but I didn't understand that when he offered to move us. By the time I'm realizing something is seriously wrong, my whole table is griping about the heat.  We ate our meal in hot misery. At best, everyone's dish was mediocre. Mine was overly salty. The rigatoni tasted like homemade, but homemade by someone who wasn't a very good cook. My brother's pasta with shellfish was bland.  The heat is rising.  I get up to use the restroom and complain about the heat. The guy doesn't know what I'm even talking about and points me to someone I assume is the manager.  The manager says, \"well, have you already eaten? Then what do you want me to do about it?\"  He's surly and confrontational. I don't know that I was looking to DO anything in particular, but I wanted to know why they had seated people in a room with no a/c when they had another dining room with functional a/c.  Manager, \"it went out. What are we going to do? Announce to everyone that it's out? No, we want you to enjoy your meal in peace.\"  Uh...\"enjoy meal\" and no a/c in Las Vegas in July are two things that do not go together.  I walked away from Mr Surly vowing to never go back.  At $30-35/entree, mediocre food, surly manager, no a/c, ugly (I mean butt ugly) decor, and apparently a near fist fight in the parking lot (I didn't see it...someone who was with us went out to smoke and saw it), I would not only never go back, but would tell you you'd be a fool to go.  Bah! The topper that made the worst taste in my mouth was really the manager. It's rare to encounter someone that nasty in a food service industry.  One of the all time worst meals I've ever had. If I could give it negative stars, I would.  If you want great Italian at a better price, go to Pasta Mia. If you want great Italian at a more expensive price, go to Valentino's.",

This is an off strip restaurant, you don't have to walk a mile in a casino to get here.  Piero's has been featured in some major movies Casino for one, and it is a celebrity hide away. It is very unpretentious, you'll see Vegas locals and high rollers and everyone in between. I saw Justin Timberlake here once and Penne from Penne and teller.  OK...now to the food and service. The service is topnotch. Your never without a drink, they even offer bottled water for free not the usual filtered tap. When the bread basket comes it just out of the oven a delish!!!! The menu offers classic Italian and seafood. The Piero's classic is a bone in Veal Parm, I think its like 30 ounces.    This is def a must for people who visit Vegas often and want to get off the strip. It is very old school Vegas, and reservations are a must.   And if you go tell then Lisa from Boston sent you!!!!!

However, the service was horrific enough that all I remember from dining there is that the food was good, but overshadowing all of it was the terrible, terrible service.  We had to not only ask our server for everything, but to ask the waitstaff to FIND our server.  From the menu to the checks to water, we spent ten minutes in vain trying to find our server and then waiting ten minutes once we actually found him to get our menu/water/check/etc.  This was incredibly annoying.  But the biggest irk of the evening was the management..  Clearly they favor the Vegas regulars as well they should since they're regulars and repeat customers.  However, walking the dining room for the entire two hours and stopping at every table EXCEPT ours (even for a hello good evening) and not even making eye contact is just rude.  Were we not supposed to notice that every table except ours got gladhanded?  Or the fact that the tables that arrived after us got service first, food first, and left before we even got our entrees?  For the $300+ we spent there, I'm more than happy to spend that money elsewhere.  Vegas isn't exactly lacking expensive high quality restaurants.  Give this place a pass if you're not into getting treated like a fourth-class citizen.",

We were here for a business dinner during CES.  There was 5 of us in the party, with reservations.  We were promptly seated, and the service from the waitress was good - she was friendly and knowledgeable.  I ordered the veal osso bucco, supposedly a 27-yo recipe.  The food literally took over an hour to arrive.  When the food finally arrived, this 27-yo recipe was a huge disappointment.  The veal was tender, but definitely lacked flavor.  To makeup for the food being late, our waitress gave us a free dessert offering.    Overall, this expensive restaurant was expensive, but not worth the time nor money.

There were other restaurants more highly rated than this, yes, but I had hoped to find a balance between good food, great service and reasonable price. Not cheap, just not ridiculous as many of the higher rated places were. And, not French.   So, we chose Piero's. First, the place was nice. Not stuffy or formal but classy. We were eating early so it was very quiet when we came in but filled up quickly. Second, the server was gracious and jovial. No real complaints about that. Third, the food was good. But just good. I wanted something to knock me down with it's amazingness, but that did not happen. Not that I didn't scarf down every morsel, but I feel I've had as good at other places. Portion sizes were large but not stupidly large like many Italian places.   It didn't help that the women seated next to us were loud and talking of things more suited to a private space, kind of killed the romantic mood I had hoped for. Nor did it help that there was a small child who clearly wanted to leave in the next room over for most of the meal.   Again, I shouldn't be so hard on a place that fails to live up to some imaginary perfection I often expect. But I will visit another restaurant for my \"splurge\" place next time.",

Sit in the bar and take it all in. The shrimp cocktail, garbage salad, fresh fish, whole roasted chicken and steaks are the standouts.  I think their NY Strip is the finest in Las Vegas. Some of the pastas are clunkers, otherwise Piero's is 5 Stars for me.  Insider tip, engage the bartenders, they're superb.",

My friend had the osso buco, and while I thought it was delicious...and so did he... he also said that he's had better.    (I'll have to try out this supposed better osso buco at sometime.)  But the service was superb.  It felt like we were our server's only table.  Very attentive, but not hovering at all.  When our plates were cleared, too full for desserts, our server suggested ending the evening with a bit of limoncello instead.  Benissimo.   Absolutely the perfect suggestion.  The perfect way to end the meal.",

    "text": "My Boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here. While waiting for our table we sat at the bar and talked with some of the other patrons who were mostly locals and evidently frequented this establishment enough to be on first name basis with the staff. That is always a good sign that the food should be something special.  The decor reminded me of a bygone era when the rat pack \"owned\" Las Vegas.  Enough about the ambiance, now on to the meal. We started off with the crab cake appetizer and the special of butterflied gulf shrimp that were grilled and placed on a butter based sauce.  Crab cake was good, had a nice touch of heat and plenty of lumpy crab meat.  The grilled shrimp were slightly over cooked and hard to extract from their shell, thus making them a little chewy.  Despite their chewiness, they were delicious and had a great flavor. We split the caesar salad which they were kind enough to bring us separate plates. My only disappointment was that the salad was WAY over dressed thus making the romaine soggy. I tried to scrape some of the dressing off but it was stuck on there like glue! It was also pretty skimpy on the parmesan cheese. Next time will ask for dressing on the side.   Now for the highlight, Osso Bucco! This dish was worth 5 stars!  We decided to split the dish and they brought us each our separate pasta side and served the veal shank \"family style\". The taste and texture of the veal was amazing, the marrow was fabulous and we fought over who was going to get the last bite. If this wasn't such a nice place I would have used my fingers to get every last bit out!  The pasta had that nice bite to it and with the addition of the braising sauce made it something special! Our only regret was that we did not have room for dessert!  Maybe next time!",

I ordered Osso Bucco so did 2 of the other 4 people. When it finally arrived it was tender but with very little taste. Very Bland! The cost was very high and we had much better meals the rest of our time in LV. To be fair my associate had the eggplant and said it was good.

If you like the novelty of the old-school Italian restaurant and need to get away from the strip, I would check it out.   This restaurant is stuck in 1982, which makes it charming in my opinion.   The Italian gentleman running the show was a riot.  He's very passionate about the restaurant.  I can envision the cast from Casino eating here and getting in character.    The veal dish I ordered was the best veal I've eaten.  They also have a good wine list.  The server recommended a Pinot Grigio that was reasonably priced and enjoyable.  As a matter of fact, the server was nice and conversational.  Just make sure you ask the waiter what's good b/c my wife ordered a pasta dish that was a total dud.  On more thing to note, that it's on the low end of the $$$$ price scale.  Just around $60 per person.",

A very unassuming exterior and a simple and charming interior. Wait staff were very professional. We started out with the Avacado and shrimp and Anchovie salads. Entrees were Osso Bocco with a 3 1/2 inch long bone with a generous serving of pasta and the Vitello del chef (scaloppine with cheese and red peppers). All were very good and large portioned.

I must start by saying italian food, like mexican food is very inexpensive to make so I found the prices not only a bit high but extremely high. For this amount of money Id rather go to Del Frisco's for an amazing steak dinner. That being said, the prawn and the smoked salmon appetizer were absolutely amazing. I had ordered the Osso Buco because it sounded so exotic as prepared overnight simmering in a red wine sauce. When delivered, I found it to be very greasy (from fat) and very bland. I guess I was expecting an array of flavors but found none. I gave it 2 stars because of blandness, lack of richness if you will. Will I go back, maybe if someone else buys.",

A bit off the strip near the Las Vegas Convention center. We walk in and the mood is chill and on the upscale side. Definitely want to wear something nice to this restaurant. A classic, old Vegas atmosphere.  We were in a large group of 12. The restaurant was a little over half filled so you can tell it was a popular place. The service was prompt and great, the menu looked very good, and the specials of the day made it hard to choose a dish. I ended up with the Osso Buco, a veal shank with bone marrow and fresh egg noodles and creme sauce. The whole dish was very tasty. The shank meat was very tender and flavorful. The egg noodles were just right and the bone marrow was the highlight.   Other dishes that were enjoyed by our group was a thick cut sword fish, lobster and chicken. Prices vary but can easily get up there, especially with the specials.   I definitely will go back and highly recommend, if you want a change of pace from the Vegas strip feel.",

That's flat out unprofessional-  We were then seated at a nice quite table. That's when the waiters consistently forgot about us. 30min to get our champagne! Our dinner took nearly three hours not because we were taking our time! Our glasses were constantly empty, we had to take our bubbly because they didn't serve it all before we were done! (Champagne was NOT table side otherwise I would have poured it myself). We dined with our 2yr old and asked for a quick dinner. didn't go as planned. We even had to walk around the restaurant to find our server to get cashed out!! He was busy watching the live music! While the food is really good, at those prices you can go to Sinatra's at the Wynn for the same price with great service.",

I had the highly touted osso bucco and my wife the veal saltimboca. We did not finish either. As I told our very nice waiter, they were both unremarkable. I am a huge osso bucco fan and this was below average. My wife ate about 1/2 of hers. She rated hers the same. Rao's is head and shoulders above this. I should have smelled a rat when at 8 on a Wednesday it was maybe 1/2 full. The crab cake appetizer would have been good had the crab been fresh and not covered in a nasty sauce. The cook (chef would be too generous) send some complimentary cream corn which was made with either frozen or canned corn and could have been Stouffer's. The salads were airline grade. To cap it off we couldn't get a cab for about 15 minutes. I feared we were trapped in 'The Twilight Zone'.  The best part of the meal was we didn't get food poisoning. i rarely review on Yelp but Piero's is deserving of it.

It just didn't seem acceptable to make a patron wait for as long as I had to order/enter my name for a reservation. The food may have redeemed this place in most areas, but it just barely made even. By the way, the salmon was incredibly crispy and a bit medium rare which I loved but the Brussel sprouts (which I were told were crispy and roasted, tasted more like bagged and boiled). The final part was the value for the cost. I'll add that while I was told my Caesar salad was an additional charge of replacing the Italian salad, I didn't expect it would be $14 additionally! Four drinks and two entrees is steep at $180.00 especially for this nutmeg state gal. I might be back, but only convenience.",

It wasn't my offichttps://media3.px.yelpcdn.com/static/20101216/i/ico/star_big_4.gife, but I love parties of any kind, so i thought \"why  not?\" I'm loving the dimly lit atmosphere of this place! Also, the servers were as friendly as it gets, and they were quite knowledgeable on the menu. The service was excellent and attentive. Crusty sourdough loaves were promptly placed on the table and the house salad was exceptionally tasty as well.  For my entree I had the Linguini Portofino which contained the most succulent, candy-sweet scallops that I've probably ever tasted. The seafood was cooked to perfection! However, it seems the hit of the night was the gargantuan slab of red meat known as their Prime rIb special that had everyone's mouth watering (i don't eat red meat or pork, so I can't vouch for the taste). I swear the size of that prime rib would've put Fred Flintstone's brontosaurus ribs to shame!  Anyhow, for dessert I had the coconut sorbet and mixed berries. Heaven on a spoon!   Yay! They had my Hendricks gin martinis, and that made me oh-so happy!  Of course I was the life of the office party (even though I didn't know anyone and my career isn't even remotely affiliated with dermatology! haha!)  Come to this place to escape the hustle and bustle of the strip and  to be catered to with the utmost friendly service. I've gotta come back and check out the piano bar. It looked like an awesome scene!  Um, I still don't get the whole \"fish market\" thing though. Hmmm....",

I could live with out eating the bone marrow from the bone, but I tried two bites (when in rome) and just left a nice last bite of Oso Buca to go back to and finish on a delicious taste/note. Place was packed with locals, service staff was Trying hard but seemed a bit over whelemed.  Food and ambiance was great and would go back.",

Growing up in CT (between Boston and NYC), we have had the privilege of eating great Italian food.       Our waiter, Marc, was excellent. The bread was tasty. Salads were bland and tasteless. A lot of reviews talked about spinach raviolis in cream sauce. It was the highlight of our meal (as was the creamed corn).  The veal shank (Osso bucco) was fork tender but bland. My husband ordered a chicken and eggplant dish which was equally forgettable and had it returned.       Honestly, there has to be better Italian food or Vegas is in trouble. Save your money on this one.",

I have sold and entertained the largest and best retailers world wide and I will say this is the best.  Several years ago my son attended the BIG SMOKE and we ate here 2 of the 4 nights, the other 2 was at Mortons.  PS my son has spent 11 years in the hotel industries 5 in LV and he was impressed.  The negative reviews were from California people and having lived 5 years in Huntington Beach I can say they do not know great.  You must eat here if you love food and fun. Lee",

    "text": "We visited Piero's for our 5th wedding anniversary and had an amazing experience. First time patrons and didn't know what to expect. There are a lot of great places to eat in Vegas and pieros definitely belongs in that category. But what makes pieros stand out is all the little things other places miss. When we first pulled in, we were led to valet. Valet is free and seems to be the standard so we happily stopped. The valet opened my wife's door and helped get out of the car. Great start to the night. Upon arriving we were greeted by the front desk and they were expecting our arrival. Our table was ready with little wait and we were sat immediately. The table was moved out to make room for us to sit and perfectly placed for us to be comfortable. The decor was simple and classic. Music was pleasant and soft enough to have a chat. The staff was over immediately taking drink orders and wine orders. Javier and Jonathan were very attentive and friendly. Ian our captain came over and explained the specials and the menu. His knowledge was vast and descriptive. I came in wanting fish and ended up the succulent cut w your knife osso bucco (house special) because of Ian's recommendation. He also got us excited for stone crabs which were out of this world amazing. The food was without a doubt amazing. But what really stood out was the finger cleaning warm cloth after the crab was finished these small touches are fantastic. The osso bucco was amazing but the bread paired w the sauce really stood out. We never had to ask for more bread or drinks. Everything was there when we needed it. The small fork for the marrow was delivered In perfect timing. The manager came over and offered us dessert for our anniversary but again, the small touch of making sure we had a ride home was awesome. First time I was ever asked that in a restaurant. We had a memorable and delicious experience. I would recommend pieros to anyone wanting great food and great memories.",

Evan came out and greeted us and I told him I had written a review about a less than stellar visit and he responded to it that he wanted the opportunity to make it right. This visit was a tremendous success. The wait staff was excellent and Evan couldn't have been more gracious. Between us we had the shrimp cocktail appetizer, three different types of salad, The  Usso Bucco, and a vegetarian pasta fettuccine.  The garbage Caesar was as good as the reviews said it was. The shrimp was plentiful with just the right amount of artichoke hearts. The Usso Bucco fell off the shank when you showed it the fork. I've never had that dish before and I was so glad I gave it a try. My friend has had it in several restaurants throughout the country and confirms this is the best.  I wanted to thank Evan for his gracious hospitality but saw that he was on the phone at the bar when it was time for us to leave. I had planned to tell the host to thank him for us but he saw us leaving and quickly hung up the phone And came over to say goodbye which I thought was above and beyond. You can't beat the old Las Vegas character of this place. This will certainly be on our to do list when we come back to Vegas again.",

The bartenders are second to none. This is the restaurant I will take my 'special clients'.  My traditional order includes getting a blue cheese olive vodka martini. Never been to a place where the drink is served with a meniscus!   There really isn't anything on the menu you can go wrong with. The Osso Buco is a staple, but I have had almost everything on the menu and have always exclaimed 'this is amazing'. I usually ask my waiter for their top 3 and then order something I would not normally fix at home.   Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "It was our Anniversary last night. My fiance called in and made reservations and specifically told them it was our anniversary..and asked if they could do something nice, the lady on the phone said sure no problem. We got there, valet the car and walk in. Very nice in the front, huge private party in the bar. We are then sat in this oversized corner booth that is connected to another couple sitting there, so romantic and intimate it is not, wait staff running around everywhere, like chickens with their heads cut off, very loud, and we seriously sat there with water and bread for over 10 mins, no menus, no waiter to take drink orders...just bread and water. Had our water refilled and a second loaf of bread before our waiter ever showed up. He finally showed up and took just our drink order, still no menus, even though I had asked the water guy for some and the waiter when he took our diet coke and tea order which we didn't receive for another 10 mins. Then finally after almost 30 mins sitting in our non romantic loud booth we receive our menus. The waiter then walked away, we reviewed the menus, ended up ordering the special features which were the garbage Cesar, caprese salad, Oso bucco and rock crab claws.  Salads came out, those were great.  Dinner came out and the display was ok.  Rock crab was delicious but they were the same as any other restaurant that I've had them at, I had 6 of them. The oso bucco was a new experience for my fiance he had never had it before. Honestly it tasted like a good pot roast. Nothing special. He's actually made me a better pot roast in our crock pot. The ambiance was terrible... the wait staff running around everywhere was very distracting, the old couple next to us yelling at each other because they couldn't hear each other talk was very distracting. The man at the next table upset because their calamari appetizer never came out and then his steak was wrong was all too much. Our drink glasses were empty but the water man was on our water... But drinks empty. At $5 a soda and ice tea they never should have been empty. We saw our waiter 1 time after we were served and that was because he was dealing with the guy next to us with his steak issue. So he came by us after.  The booths are not made for average size people...we are not huge people but felt very clostrophobic in the booth. The decor was random, not like the front, the back room they took us to had random pieces of 80s artwork on the walls, nothing like their website.  Then we get the bill for this dinner that was nothing special ..  $209.00!!!!! We would have better enjoyed the Golden Steer which had amazing ambiance, incredible service and food was the best we have had since living in Vegas. Being locals I feel like these tourist traps don't care how you are treated because they will probably never see you again, expensive for that reason, not because it is worth it, but because they can charge it knowing you will pay it and just never go back.  If you really want great Italian, great ambiance, service and food, go to Capos or to Chicago Joes!",

He ordered the veal chop parmigiana with eggplant.  It was excellent.  The portion was very large which made for great leftovers the following day.   We shared the garbage salad which we have had previously and it did not disappoint    Your bread was great as always.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the almond crusted halibut.  The portion was a good size and the fish was moist  but the fish had no flavor.   I gave my husband a taste and his comment was \"I think they forgot something when they cooked it.\" We will be back but I'll stay away for the halibut. Service was great  Our waitress was very attentive and had a very good sense of humor",

So I decided to take my wife here for her birthday.  Front bar area has suddenly turned into a sports bar. Crowed, and loud. Bump your way to to your table.  Service is lovely except for the waiter having to speak quite loudly to be heard. I will say it was very busy, for a Thursday night, so they must be doing something right. So now we look forward to a great Italian meal. It's sad to say that the best part of the dinner was the bread and  the 2 starters.  As for the entrees my wife had \" their signature\" Oso buco\" which she didn't eat because it was so salty. I had their signature \"bone in veal parm\" which looked lovely and massive but I'm not sure it was veal. First time I didn't eat a veal parm. The dessert was a free treat for her birthday which was nice ( a pint of Hagen Daze with a dal-up of whipped cream on top)  I don't mine paying a $200.00 ( includes tip and 2 glasses of wine) especially  for a special birthday but it would have been better spent in at least 20 other places.",

We ordered the veal parm and our waiter asked if we wanted to share the salad and pasta. We weren't terribly hungry so we said ok.   Once we looked at the bill, we saw that the veal was $54 not $39 like on the menu. We were told what we \"got\" was off the menu. We were also charged for the salad ($24) and small side of pasta ($18).   I've waited tables and I never would have pulled something like that. They basically nickel and dime you for stuff but make you think it's included so just be careful.   The food was ok, 3 out of 5. I would have given 5 stars if I didn't feel they were intentionally trying to screw their customers.",

Piero's has it all including some of the best bone in Veal Parm this guy has had in a long while.  They pour a pretty generous arctic cold vodka martini too.  Let's be honest, Piero's isn't cheap.

First trip was a few years ago, ran into a couple celebrities from CSI. We ordered a nice bottle of wine, calamari, and I got the \"a zuppa di pesce\". Sooo good and sooo much food. I finished the lobster and a lot of the large items, but couldnt finish some of the calamari. Really good dish that I almost got it the 2nd time I went.  2nd trip was more recent. Nice bottle of wine again, started with Calamari which may of been the most tender calamari I've ever had, the garbage ceasar which a few of the people were raving about, than the butterfly veal parm with eggplants. MAN!!! that veal parm was ridiculous. It was on special that night and I think a double cut, I only got about halfway through it and devoured the rest later. I was a bit shocked when the bill came to see the price on it (think it was $65 or $68). Holy crap! thats more than most steaks i've had at steakhouses, than again it was better than most steaks i've had at steakhouses so that eased the pain. There is a on menu veal parm which is nearly half the cost, so if I go back I will probably do that since I didn't need it to be that large.  TL/DR: Go here, get a nice bottle of wine, calamari, garbage ceasar, and on menu veal parm.",

It is valet only which I love but if you don't that might be a problem for you. Everyone was very nice and I thought the service was quite exceptional. Even though our waiter was quite busy with other guests our assistant server Eman was so helpful and when we asked him about desserts he gave us a suggestion that was one of the best desserts I can remember. I forgot the name because it was Drange and I have never heard of it but, It was a sliced creampuff type pastry with whipped cream, marscapone, Finley sliced strawberries, strawberry puree, and small pieces of shaved chocolate. I describe this because it was like eating heaven.  As for the food, we are vegetarian so unfortunately we were limited to our choices of eating. By the looks of it their meat dishes they looked fabulous!  The menu looked like it specialized in veal, seafood, and pork.  Overall we were very happy. Their cappuccino was like being in Italy so we were happy about that as well. We will come back on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

He also thanked our nephew for his service, however, I expected more from the restaurant, especially since I planned ahead.

Their garbage salad is ridiculously good. I literally got it 3 days in a row. It is the best Caesar salad I've ever had. Its so stuffed with shrimp that when I sent my buddies a picture they asked me if I got the ceviche. Haha. Evan and his family are doing an amazing job at running their restaurant and keeping their clients happy. Don't miss out on this amazing restaurant, environment and experience. Next time you are in Vegas do yourself a favor and make a reservation for Piero's. Dress up and take it all in. You're welcome In advance!! Cheers!!",

The much touted Garbage Salad was acceptable and the Veal Saltambucco was dried out and OKAY, faint praise at $35. The rest of the table was equally impressed with their meal.

This is not your very american Italian restaurant, in fact I don't even want to call it that but just the real Italian restaurant. Alright here is my experience- I spent a second dinner there as a married woman with my husband, parents in-law and new friends for a dinner prepared by some of their business collegues. The dinner is to support local traders and they do it when they are in Las Vegas during a trade show. As we enter the place we were greeted by dim lights and drinks at the bar, then we were escorted to the function room thats held for private events. At first I wasn't really used being seated with a very dim light but I get used to it, it gives more Classical Italian style, the room was decorated with renaissance style paintings, and there was floor-ceiling wall cellar. We were just flooded with food from Aperitivo, anti-pasti, primo & insalata. Made me only to have very tiny space for dolce. Also we were given a toast as a newly married couple and thats why this place was also very memorable. I remember one of the restaurant managers being there most of the time to introduce the food and tell whats next,next and next. Also the servers were top notch making this formal dinner vey fantastic. For few hours I felt like I was having that dinner in Italy! Although I really avoid to take pictures, the memories of that dinner night at Pieros will last a lifetime! And I will surely come back there next time my husband and I are in Vegas!",

We had a group of 15+ so we were seating in the dining off the bar area and had the whole room to ourselves.  We started with orders of stone crab, calamari, and giant cocktail shrimp for the table. The seafood was prepared to perfection and disappeared as quickly as it was served. I had a spin-off on a Caesar salad that included avocado and hearts of palm, which was better than most restaurant salads I've ever had. I ended up not ordering an entree but, during the meal, I actually wandered around the table visiting so I had a chance to try the veal chop, the osso bucco, the linguine al pomodoro, and the pollo al carciofi. I also fell in love with their creamed corn and, after commenting on it, was presented with a copy of the recipe to take home!    Overall, everyone left happy and full. I was very impressed with everything I ate and found a new favorite wine in The Prisoner. The service is at an exemplary and outstanding level that is a standard of excellence other establishments should model. Piero's is an off-Strip destination that any lover of Italian food should plan to visit. I will go back any chance I get! Bravo!",

If you want great Italian go to one of the many other places that do business in Las Vegas.   Piero's is a tourist trap and not that great. The service is blah and overblown - all fluff and no stuff. The veal was not so great. It definitely did not last for a second leftovers meal. Dry and tasteless - well a hint of grease. The pasta was worse. The gravy is mediocre. The pasta was under cooked and obviously in water that was not changed in a while. The pasta was not crunchy but not cooked al dente. It was two grades above and one shade below crunchy. It also tasted as if it was covered in slime. This is the result of not changing the water. At $30 for a plate of spaghetti - they should nail it. Speaking of getting nailed, the first time in I was charged an automatic tip and then tipped. The service was so slow and bad that I did not pick up on it right away. When I did the promised to fix it and credit my card. They never followed through. On an $800 plus bill that is terrible and a rip off I may have to address through the court when I get a chance sometime over the next 6 years. (Breach of oral contract).  The last time in I made a few things clears I was in to buy a gift certificate and was going to the Aerosmith concert. It took an hour to be served a full plate and a half plate of pasta.   They forgot my eggplant and forgot the $250 gift certificate. The pasta when served to my 8 year old daughter was so blazing hot it burned her mouth and she cried. In response the nit wit waiter who was no where to be found throughout slammed down a glass of ice.   Yes throughout the entire time there I had to flag down other wait staff - including the bill.   When charged $60 for two plates of pasta and drinks I expect more.   Skip it.    is not that great - it's great but",

One of the best I have ever had. The portion was huge! 2 people could be sharing one veal chop, the chop was at least 10 inches long and wide.. I ended eating half taking other half home.   We were lucky enough to be with a large party we ordered every type of dessert they had on the menu, and I got to try all of them. The cheese cake was excellent!

Upon arrival (with a reservation) we were seated at a corner table at the bar that wasn't even set.   The server didn't assist my wife to be seated, she just walked away., never to be seen again.  We were seated behind 12 Angry men, who were so sauced up (not red) that they should have stopped serving them. They were loud and stumbling to and fro.   So we waited for a table setting and a modicum of service which consisted of a server dropping off bread and butter. What no olive oil???? Note, we still had not been provided with eating utensils so we had to cromagnum man it and eat the bread by hand!   At this juncture, 40 minutes into the fiasco a gentleman came by and rushed threw the specials, never to be seen again ( a reoccurring theme).  Know we dine at a litany of restaurants both high brow and casual and this was the baddest of the bad.  We decided to exit strange right and will never, EVER, Return!  Btw, to their credit, they did not charge us for our drinks or the bread.",

I know you are saying \"oh, please\"...but True story. Next I had the Agnolotti Freschi  Alla Crema. I wanted to lick the plate but I kept mt composure. Dessert was chosen from this display that they wheeled up to the table.  Ended with some delicious espresso. Loved the feel of the place and the service was incredible.

We cabbed over and when we pulled in we saw that it's all valet - no one parks their own car, kinda cool. Piero's is old-school Vegas, definitely a local place - many folks were obviously regulars and know the staff of the restaurant.   We were seated in a nice half-booth with a good view of the room, our server was John and he was great, we enjoyed that the staff was dressed in the old-school white waiter coats, classy (all we had seen was staff dressed in black in the Strip restaurants). Hubby started with a Cosmo - perfectly made, and I had a glass of wine. We had the proscuitto with melon for an appetizer and it was so fresh and delicious.  For dinner, hubby had the Pasta Bolognese, which was excellent and the pasta was perfect al dente. I had the \"gargage\" Caesar (with shrimp, avocado, tomato and hearts of palm - with the dressing on the side. It was FABULOUS and very filling)  There is a lounge area where Pia Zadora plays regularly, which is kinda neat.  We enjoyed Piero's and we would go back.",

No \"celebrity chef\" or \"ultra lounge\" to draw in the masses- just top quality food and world class service.  Awesome, delicate,  freshly-made dishes and the best seafood around (Lobster Ravioli to die for!!).  Yes, it is dressy and expensive, but the entire expereince- from the hostess remembering your name, to the excellent bar, to the attentive wait staff, to the out of this world food- is worth it!  This is not your \"Spaghetti Warehouse\" type of Italian food, so if that is what you like, go somewhere else.  Be sure to make a reservation, dress well, and always tip well!!

Servers are generally slow however it seems each table has like 3 servers that come by at different points so you can flag pretty much anyone down at any time.  Servers are also not very chatty which might come across as blunt or rude to some.  But the reason to go to Piero's is the food.  Absolutely fantastic.  My wife and I go to Vegas once to twice a year and each time we say we are going to try somewhere new and we always end up at Piero's.  I just can't pass up the chance to eat the Osso Bucco.  Freakin fantastic.  My wife decided to go with a very simple dish this past trip and got bolognese.  I thought she was crazy but it was one of the best dishes I've had in ages.  We asked for more and more bread just to dip in the sauce.  Be prepared for a big bill though (at least in my opinion).  Two apps, two meals and two drinks each came to $185 including tip.  It hurt the pocketbook but, with such great food, I found myself surprisingly not complaining yet again.",

    "text": "We recently had dinner here as a party of 6. First off this restaurant is in serious need of a facelift. It's decor is not only very dated but a bit shabby. Second the service is slow. Our reservation was for 8:00pm and we didn't order until 9:00pm. While some of the staff were courteous and efficent our waiter didn't seem particulary enthused to interact or wait on us. He read off the nightly specials with a dizzying speed that left most of us questioning what was what. I orderd one of the fish specials because I recalled that it had lemon and capers. When my dinner finally arrived approximately 90 minutes into the dining experience it neither tasted of lemon or had a single caper on it. After that long of a wait I wasn't sending it back. It was overall cooked perfectly but very bland. My husband's opinion of his entree (Pollo Al Carciofi) was the same, perfectly cooked but a little bland and boring.    The wine list is extensive but expensive, bottles start in the $70.00 range and go up over $2000.00.  If you are interested in bringing your own bottle the corkage fee is $50.00 which was literally barked at us when we brought in a bottle as a gift which we had not planned to open there.  Lastly the restaurant was NOISY. Noisy to the point of nearly ruining our dining experience. Between two large gin soaked parties and the live music entertainment I had trouble following conversation at our own table.   If you are looking for a special evening out there are far too many choices in this town to settle for mediocrity.",

Wednesday night, we took two people who have homes in PA and in Napa to Piero's.   My husband and one of the guests ordered a pasta special (pasta and meat sauce!).  We didn't even think about inquiring as to the cost of the dish.  When we received the bill, we saw that each serving cost $36.00 and the dish was only so-so.  I should have returned my Veal Sorrento - it was so tough, I basically ate the prosciutto and left the veal.  That was my fault but I hate to break the flow of a meal.  The least expensive bottle of wine was the house wine at $55.  Our bill came to $304 without the 20% tip that we include.  Outrageous!!  Piero's used to have quality food and somewhat reasonable prices.  I believe that since the conventioneers are again flocking to LV, Piero's is charging what they can get away with due to expense accounts.  This will not fly with locals.  It is a shame but we will never return.  Upon leaving, I mentioned the pricing to the maitre 'd who said - something like \"Sorry.  I don't even look at the menu so don't know.\"    Even if you are a visitor with an expense account, there are other better restaurants in town that you can visit.",

Sent them back and they came back COLD a SECOND TIME!!!!!  I let one of the staff members know what had happened... his reply was \"Oh, I will let someone know\".  No one came to the table to check on us and follow-up.  For the price ---- VERY VERY POOR --- will never go to this restaurant again!!!!!    Throughout the entire dinner, the wait staff never checked on us to see if everything was OK with the meal.  We all decided to have desert somewhere else rather than continue the poor experience at Piero's.",

    "text": "This restaurant came highly recommended to me by my foodie boss. Honestly I've delayed writing this much deserved review in part because I just feel like no review will do this restaurant justice.  It is absolutely outstanding.  This may just go down as one of the best meals I have had in my life rivaled only by maybe authentic New York Italian restaurants.  Piero's has this je ne sais quoi that most restaurants do not.  While I was dining I could literally envision the rat pack making Vegas their playground- dining there. It's seems like it's a bit of a time capsule from a bygone era where the Sands was at the height of it's heyday.  It's dimly lit which adds to the ambiance. It's a little bit off the strip but I do not mind as there is virtually no wait to be seated and there are no crowds not to mention it is TOTALLY worth it.  You can tell a lot about a restaurant by how good their bread is. We ordered the Osso Buco and ordered the Pollo al Carciofi both amazing.  Do yourself a favor and just try it you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Mesmerized!   We decided to come here since the place we wanted to check out at the Bellagio had closed. And of course, Piero's never lets down.   We started with apps, and went all the way!   Calamari: Fried to perfection. Marinara sauce on the side was good, but a bit overpowering for the tiny morsels.   BB-Q Shrimp with a spicy sauce: Though not a shrimp fan, these things were cooked just right and had a kick ass sauce to drench bread in! I thoroughly enjoyed.   Maui Onion and Anchovy Salad with Tomatoes: I can't stand raw tomatoes whatsoever, but I had to give 'em a chance, and this salad was delish. The white anchovies and sweet onions paired perfectly with the diced tomatoes. The tomatoes almost seemd slightly cookedm they didn't seem raw at all!   Veal Saltimbocca: 5 stars! The veal, wrapped in sage and prosciutto were sauteed perfectly, and the prosciutto was very generous, not just some skimpy piece most places give. And the Garlic Mashed potatoes were silky and velvety, and stayed this way the entire meal. Most places they get hard due to excess butter and the like.   Desserts: Chocolate cake, creme brulee, and tiramisu. All looked fantastic, though I didn't try.   Their espresso I had was prepared perfectly though.  Piero's really exemplifies what a True fine dining restaurant is really about. From start to finish, it's always flawless. The staff: friendly and not pushy or overbearing.   Yes, it's not all fancy n bling bling. But it's 'ol skool, Vegas style.   This place sets the bar for others to follow!",

My hotel was right next to Piero's so I walked over and sat at the bar for service. The bartender made me a great martini and I ordered a New York Strip Steak. It came with a great house salad, correctly cooked broccoli and rice pilaf. The Steak was cooked perfect (medium rare) and the service was great. Over the years I've eaten here four or five times and always had a great meal. If you are in Las Vegas, treat yourself to this Las Vegas landmark.",

Get off the strip and away from the over-inflated egos of ever-absent executive chefs. Don't let the surrounding parking lots and lame spring-break mega-bar next door deter you.  Just tell them you want the ossobuco and let them deliver whatever else is good, including a nice Chianti Riserva or Superiore. They will take care of you.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are locals, early 30's and we both work in food/beverage.  So, we know what is to be expected of such a restaurant.  To be honest, I felt like I was at California Pizza Kitchen.  Our waiter, he didn't actually ever tell us his name, treated us like we were 18 year olds, with no money, who were wasting his time.  He literally came to the table and said \"Hey, you want something to drink?'  REALLY???!  My boyfriend had been out of the country for some time and I was looking forward to a lovely, professional, romantic atmosphere and I get a waiter who already has one foot out the door?  We asked for sparkling water.  It took him so long, that tap water and a wine list was brought to us before he returned.  Then, after stumbling through the specials, no one returned to the table to get a wine order for 15 minutes!  FYI, the restaurant was almost empty and it was only 9pm.  Once the wine was ordered, our appetizers were brought to the table before the wine made it.  And of course, only one appetizer was bought because speedy gonzalez either forgot to order mine, or ordered it incorrectly...I have a food allergy.  Once my app arrived, of course, the food I'm allergic to was present in the app.  So I had to wait longer.  Oh did I mention, when he poured the wine, he wiped what was wet from the opened bottle with his hands!!!???  How unsanitary and unprofessional!  Where was the white cloth?  As we finished the apps, they had the nerve to bring out our entrees before removing the app plates and then left mine on the corner of the table with the remains of the wet cloth from our apps.  We literally had two people reaching and taking and pouring...it was ridiculous.  He didn't refill our wine at a timely manner and was speaking to us before he actually reached the table.  Overall, the service was horrible and unprofessional.  And the worst part is, this place is a gem and the food was delicious!  But in my book, service creates the atmosphere and this guy ruined it for me.  Funny enough, he thought we weren't going to be good tippers (at least that's how he was treating us) and my guy is the kind who OVER tips.  When he only left 20%, I knew he wasn't impressed with the service.  WAY TO GO!   We won't be returning.",

I ordered a special - almond encrusted sea bass with mashed potatoes and green beans, and my husband has the seafood linguini. I thought that the food was very good. The fish was moist, the pasta al dente, and everything was well seasoned.  Yes, I would go there again and yes, I would recommend Piero's to a friend.

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas just returning from a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon and Piero's was next door to our hotel.  I'm always searching for the perfect Osso Buco and was not disappointed. Very well prepared, served with fresh pasta and the all so important \"gravy\".  It needed a pinch of salt but otherwise a very large and delicious portion.  We started with an extra spicy shrimp cocktail that was extremely spicy and not pleasant.  I like extra horseradish in cocktail sauce but this was absurd.  It almost ruined my palate prior to the main course. I also did not like being charged an additional $9.00 up-charge to split a $25 shrimp cocktail with my girlfriend.  I would have rated this a 4 or 5 star but because of the overpowering, spicy shrimp cocktail and additional charge for sharing....it's a 3 star.",

Between the 4 of us we had 2 pasta dishes, one chicken and one fish dish. everyone was happy. Most entrees come with a house salad.  The staff was attentive without being over bearing.    We went for my wife's birthday. At the end of the deal they brought her a pint of ice cream surrounded with fresh berrys and whip cream. Perfect ending to a great meal.  Our 13 year old son was fine there but I'm not sure you want to bring children much younger.",

    "text": "Where to begin?  This is the most incredible restaurant that vegas has to offer.  The food, service, and atmosphere are worth every penny (and that's a lot of pennies).    I have enjoyed Pieros on special occasions for the past 5 years I have lived in Las Vegas.  The atmosphere is iconic Vegas (or what I imagined Las Vegas to be like before the mega resorts).  I hope one day I can afford it more regularly!  From arriving you are greeted by their valet.  When you enter you are greeted with classic Vegas decor.  Check out their tiger print carpet...it is beautiful.  They have a bar to one side, I am not a drinker, so I moved on in to the smiling hostess.  I would recommend making a reservation but I have never been turned away.  Seating is prompt.  Usually you will see Mr. Glussman socializing with his guests (he is the owner and he is always there!).   Once seated you have a wait staff of 3-5 people waiting on you.  The service is top notch.  Even when busy you are being served properly.  Their food is on a whole other level.  Everything I have had has been delicious. From steak to seafood it is perfect.  Pieros has the culinary Gods themselves cooking in the kitchen.   I always get the garbage Caesar salad.  It is loaded with avocado, shrimp, artichoke hearts,etc.  It is a must.  I usually opt for the special.  Last time I was their it was a hefty 6 oz filet.  The saying it melts in your mouth does no justice.  It was cooked to perfection.   Don't forget dessert.  Cream Brulee all the way.  My wife and I usually spend about $150 on the 2 of us (+tip) and remember we don't drink.  It is worth it.  It's a Vegas staple.  If your visiting it is a must.  If you live here then you aren't a True Las Vegan until you've tried it!",

    "text": "A Vegas classic...  This place has been around for many years and even featured in one of my favorite movies ever, Casino! We came here for Valentine's Day per my man and I was hoping for the best as it wasn't exactly on my radar. We both left disappointed.   To start off, an older lady who has probably been the host since it opened wasn't friendly and that's how the experience began. We arrived early and were seated near the kitchen however there were many other tables open including booths. Not cool. The room itself was a little odd. The low ceilings and outdated furniture wasn't pleasing to my eyes as I'm always into the decor. Odd space and it didn't feel like a classic Italian restaurant.   We must have been served by 6 different people this evening which was a little odd however they were all very nice. Now let's get to the food -  Started with a few cocktails, a lemon drop for me which was very smooth and a belvedere and ginger ale for my man which he enjoyed and had a few of them before the end of the evening. His second drink wasn't correct so we had to send it back. Crispy bread was brought over with very good butter.   Next we ordered crispy cheese with house marina that was a little on the spicy side and this happened to be my favorite part of the meal. After that came a garbage Caesar salad that was traditional with a few extras like - avocado, shrimp and tomatoes. The salad was on the bland side, was hoping for a more flavorful dressing.   Next came out entrees - osso bucco for him and penne alla vodka for myself. The osso bucco was fantastic loaded with flavor and bone marrow. We both enjoyed it very much. My penne was bland and boring. I make this dish better at home, was very disappointed.   For dessert we had two large chocolate dipped strawberries that were super juicy and we thoroughly enjoyed them.   The bill came and it was nearly $250. Not worth it. I've had cheaper meals that were much more memorable. At this price I expect at least one food orgasm and it never came :(",

Good reviews led us in - the maitre d was quite nice and said it'd be about 10 mins - went into the bar which was full - finally got the bartender's attention and ordered a couple of well drinks and a beer - got the bill and it was $37...thought that was a bit excessive so I asked the bartender what the cost of the drinks was - he said 15 ea for the mixed drinks and 7 for the beer - I said '...15 bucks for a well drink?\"...he said yes.  So - paid the bill and was off to the table.  Turns out, even after we CONFIRMED with the bartender the drinks were wells (which I personally watched him pour) he charged us for Grey Goose 'call drinks'.  Now, the food and service was great - but I just can't abide being lied to by a bartender.  Would I go back?  Nope - but it's no reflection on the food or waiters - both were were excellent...the bartender, however...",

Wife had the bolognese and I had their famous osso buco. Again, if you're a slack jawed yokel from the sticks expecting spaghetti and meatballs at a discount--this isn't the spot for you.

    "text": "For a night on the town in Vegas, we opted for an off the strip Old Vegas style restaurant. My brother raved about this place and told us of the great food and Old Vegas charm.   Our reservation was at 8pm and before we were seated we headed for the bar. The bar was a separate room and there was a piano and a lounge singer on the corner which reminded me of Frank Sinatra. He sang the classics: Fly me to the Moon, Luck Be a Lady...I was transported in another time, a glimpse of that Old Vegas that is now hard to find amongst the new glitz and glitter that Vegas has now become.   The cocktails at the bar was served stiff but expect steep prices...my hubby's kettle and soda was $12 and my wine was $15.   The servers, hostess and lounge singer all seemed like a character from an old movie...they were older, very proper, but with an Italian flair so much like those I would see in Sopranos, minus the gangster attitude.  Our waiter who greeted us was very friendly and told us about the specials. He mesmerized my group with his explanation of the food. he had a great italian 'soprano\" accent and a pompador hair which he kept in character the whole time.   I ordered the Osso Bucco, a special of Pieros and a dish I have never had and most of my friends ordered veal. It seems veal is the way to go here, as the menu is full of veal.   All I can say is everyone in our table ooh'd and aah'd over the food. My osso bucco was cooked for 4-6 hrs with the bone intact and my waiter stuck a little fork in the bone as I realized Im to eat the bone marrow! Cool I never had that before. The veal is tender, flavorful, and the bone marrow is unforgettable. My hubby's veal with quartered mushrooms, capers and wine butter sauce was also amazing. I couldn't help but be greedy as I ate from his plate too.   This place is an experience in its own...receiving many accolades and culinary awards. its not the glitzy in-your-face-Vegas so don't expect a contemporary and ultra modern space. It is fine dining but it is unpretentious, has a dated feel with an old vegas charm. I loved the food here and I am planning to come back and have another chance at the menu.",

The garbage Caesars was out of this world, we had 2 orders for 3 and it was perfect. The mozzarella fritti just hit the spot. One of us had the bone in veal Parmesan - perfect and he couldn't finish the portion. We split the Alaskan halibut steak and linguini with clams in white sauce. The halibut was in the \"best we ever had\" class and the linguini was prefect - the sauce however was top of the class! But that said the deserts were equally memorable. The cheese cake was amazing, the canoli fabulous and the spumoni perfect. Going back again soon. Thank you.",

We got Prosucttio Melon and then get the Caesar which is the best in town!  We also shared osso buco and Veal Parm that where amazing.  Def give this place a try, but bring your platinum card!",

Wow, that is more than I have ever paid anywhere in the world.  Craft Steak house was free the previous night.  Three of us ordered the $47 Osso Buco and they all were very good not the best ever.  The other 3 ordered pasta and they were all very good.  Salads ranged from $18 and up. The atmosphere is very old school and noisy.  To me this place is over priced for what you get but the food was good. I feel there are better options for Italian in Vegas.",

It was extremely tender and a very ample portion but I found it really lacking in flavor.One other person in our group expressed a similar sentiment.I will not hold this against the restaurant;if I were to come here again,which I am open to that possibility,I would just order something different.Overall,we all enjoyed this meal and I'm glad I finally tried this Las Vegas landmark.Better late than never.",

    "text": "It's been 23 years since I last dined here. I remember it being a great meal.  The place was exactly as I remembered. Old school off-strip dining for high rollers, mobsters, and tourists seeking Italian-American favorites a not-fussy atmosphere.  I didn't do as much restaurant eating back then, so it all seemed pretty amazing.  I just returned yesterday and these days I'm more discerning...  When you drop $150/person on dinner you're going to expect perfection to earn your 5 stars. So here's the rundown on the food, and yes I'll nitpick everything:  Cocktails: Large, well-made, absolutely no complaints. Wine: Just a few glasses since our cocktails were more satisfying than we expected. Only gripe was the advice of our waiter, which was more tuned to Vegas-folks than wine folks. Appetizers:  Shrimp cocktail (hey, it's Vegas right?) - excellent. Large well-cooked prawns with suuuuper spicy cocktail sauce in a good way. Garbage Caesar salad: Delicious and well dressed. One of the hits of the night. Tomato w/ Burrata: Maybe it serves us right for ordering a tomato in winter, but Vegas is all about out-of-season foods. This was a miss. Underseasoned, underdressed, poor quality control coming out of the kitchen. Pastas: Penne Vodka: Giant serving, well-sauced, perfect balance of tomato and cream. One of the better renditions, but the pasta could have been a bit more al dente. Fettucini Arrabiata: Middling. It lacked that fresh-pasta-elasticity. Again, perhaps cooked a tad too long or sat too long waiting for service. Sauce was fine, serving size was also giant.  Mains: Veal chop parmigiana: This was huge, bone-in, pounded thin, breaded and sauced. Granted, after doing so much to the dish it's hard to judge the quality of the meat, but damn it tasted sooo good. This is a winner and probably the sort of thing you want in an Italian-American dinner in Vegas. Osso Buco: This is their signature dish and oddly, it was just OK. Meat was quite nice, meltingly tender and with generous marrow, but the seasoning was kind of boring. I've had this with much better and more interesting sauce in other places. Ginormous New York steak: It was delicious but cooked more than we had asked. We did point this out to the waiter and he agreed, but my agreeable friend said it was still fine for his purposes. (Perhaps our server could at least offered to fire a new one.)  Service: Very good. Cheerful, good sense of humor, added to the fun atmosphere of the night. Host, valet, bussers were all terrific. They do train their staff well here.  Ambience: Clubby old school vibe in a 1980's building with crappy exterior architecture.   So nitpicks aside, our group had a really fun time at Piero's. A long, satisfying, uncomplicated meal. The prices were decent compared to on-strip dining at the fancy-chef places. The portions were generous and the food tasty. It's a solid 4 stars. The details could have pushed it to 5 and I hope the kitchen is open to feedback.",

After we finished our dinner and requested the dessert tray it took 15 minutes. After we ordered dessert it took 30 minutes for delivery, and they ran out of 2 different desserts. We ordered coffee and drinks instead. It took 45 minutes for that to arrive. It also took the owner to step in and press the service staff.  We take people to dinner to be impressed with our company. It's not impressive if you need to apologize for the meal.",

Our waiter was Billy - he was fantastic! I did not catch the names of the other staff at our table, but they were also great! Our water glasses were never empty, and we were asked many times if we needed anything else. I was very impressed with how attentive they were to our table and all of the tables around us. The food was very fresh and very tasty - we are so stuffed (and brought some food home that we couldn't finish!)! We ate the calamari, 'garbage' caesar salad, pollo al carciofi, osso bucco, and cheesecake. So, so good!   The restaurant itself is awesome - it has a very classic Vegas feel. We are locals and very much appreciate the classic atmosphere!  5 stars! See you again soon!",

We've settled into arriving early and eating in the bar, which is a great experience.  Lots of regulars, including some old timers who have been in town forever, and make for some great conversations about \"how things were\".  The food is always outstanding (particularly the Osso Bucco), the service at the bar is friendly and fast, and the last 2 times we've been there, the same Sinatra-esque lounge lizard has performed, making for the perfect atmosphere for throwing back a few belts before heading out to the casinos for a weekend of Vegas delights.    If you like an old-school type of joint, off the strip and largely devoid of tourists, Piero's is a must-visit.",

    "text": "I love old Las Vegas, and Piero's is a place you must try out if you feel the same way. It doesn't look like much has changed since the Vegas' hayday with Sinatra, Sammy Davis, and Dean Martin. Piero's is just one of those cool, old school places. The food is overpriced, the quality is decent enough, and you can justify paying the final tab if you remember why you're there - to experience old Las Vegas.  From a food quality standpoint, I would say Piero's is definitely above average, but nothing that would make me feel like I need to go back. I ordered a pasta dish, exactly what it's called, I'm not sure. It was a Spinach Ravioli with a cream sauce. Very good, but not outstanding. I thought the spinach inside the ravioli might be a little creamy or have something in there to go along with it, but it was simply spinach. The best dish at our table was the Veal Parmesan. If I was to go back, that would definitely be at the top of my ordering list. The best part of the entire meal was the service - it was second to none. Our drinks never needed filling, everyone at the table ordered from the bar and we were asked several times throughout if we needed additional drinks (of course we did). The food was spaced out perfectly. There's nothing worse than getting your appetizer and 4 minutes later the entree's come out. It was a good 15-20 minutes between appetizer's and entree's. That said, don't go to Piero's if you're in a rush. This is a place that forces you to sit back, relax, take in some of old Vegas, and enjoy a quality meal.  Certain places make you wonder, if the walls could speak what would they say. This is definitely one of those places.",

I have eaten at high end places all over the strip and this one ranks as one of my favorites. It is CLASSIC (New York style) Italian food with an old-school ambiance. Believe it or not, but the list of people who have eaten here could top the who's who of any restaurant in the world.  The service is phenomenal. The owner(s) are there every night, keeping an eye on everything that happens in there. All the waiters work together, so there is constant coverage of tables. Seriously, top notch.  I had the avocado and heart of Palm salad. It is deconstructed and simple, but is pure deliciousness. I ordered the bolognese and my husband had the filet. Both are over the top. The portions are huge and everything is just REALLY GOOD. My husband couldn't decide between the cut of meat he wanted, so the wait brought out both cuts RAW so my husband could see the marbling. Seriously?!? What other restaurant does that?  If you are looking for a quiet, super gourmet restaurant to have inventive food, DON'T GO HERE. This is classic, throwback food, service and atmosphere. It doesn't get more Vegas than this.",

    "text": "I'm so blown away right now and not in a good way! Where do I even begin...  Valentines dinner with the Hub. We had reservations for 8:30pm. We were totally excited to be having a date night on a special occasion and very hungry to boot.  We got seated pretty quickly. Ordered cocktails, a beer for him and a dirty vodka martini for me. My cocktail was the best thing I had out of the entire meal. Only minor complaint is, if you're ordering a $20 cocktail that is served in a martini glass, why fill it to the complete top of the rim? (waiter poured it table-side) to the point that it's actually dripping down the sides of the glass. I get that some would appreciate knowing they're getting their monies worth, but when you have to lift that over-filled cocktail to your lips and a lot of it goes everywhere else but into your mouth, that's a waste of a $20 drink, but hey that's just me.  Next...asked one of our many waiters for a straw for my water. Waited 15 min to get the straw (had to ask for it again) not to mention getting attitude for asking for said straw in the first place. Same waiter brings out our bread basket and butter, she's either having a bad night, or still miffed that I asked for a straw. She plops the bread basket down, right onto my side plate (you know, the one you use for the bread). Wow! Okay, and here I thought we were at a fine dining restaurant, not a burn and turn diner. Bread was rock hard and so was the butter. Nothing like trying to eat a slab of un-spreadable butter on rock hard bread.  Another waiter finally comes to our table and rattles off the dinner specials (and I do mean rattle) he was talking so fast, we couldn't even comprehend half of what he was saying. He was obviously in a rush and made us feel like he was in turn, rushing us.  On to ordering an appetizer. We chose the stuffed artichoke, only to be told 20 min later from the same waiter, they're sold out (on a night they know that it's going to be extra busy?) bummer for us, poor planning on their part.  Chose the Maui onion salad. $19 for a bowl of onions is pretty much all we got, with an adequate amount of tomatoes and sparse avocado and heart of palms. What was more of an insult, I am originally from Hawaii; born and raised. Maui onion is such, where you could eat it pretty much like an apple if you chose to. It's sweet, with no bitter lingering aftertaste like a regular raw onion. What we got served was NOT Maui onion (they probably ran out of that too and gave us regular onions thinking we wouldn't be the wiser- wrong!). We couldn't get rid of the overpowering bitter aftertaste of onions from our mouths.   Ordered our meals. I had lots of questions as this was our first time here, same waiter who took our appetizer order wasn't having it. Again we felt rushed. As I'm looking over the menu to make a final decision, he's tapping his pen on his writing pad. Just plain rude! I order one of the steak dishes (medium-rare), Hub orders the eggplant. I asked if I could substitute the Italian salad that comes with the meal for a Ceaser salad, offered to pay an up-charge. Sorry, if you want that, you'll have to pay the full $19 price for it. What?!  For being as rushed as we were, it took forever for our dinner to even come out.  As we're still waiting, my Hub's water glass was empty, mine had literally 2 sips left. One of the waiters comes to the table, fills his glass and walks away. The other waiter walks up literally after that one walks away and says, is that water in your glass, do you want more? All cocky and again, just plain rude!  Our meal finally comes and my steak is charred, tough AND over cooked (I ordered med-rare). I sent it back. Waiter offered to have it remade, no thanks! (So I can sit there and wait another 45 min, while my Hub finishes his meal and we end up eating separately?!). I ended up eating a couple of bites from his eggplant, which was decently seasoned, but very mushy.  Waiter offered to give us a free dessert on the house. We declined. We just wanted to get out of there.   Pretty telling about a restaurant when, as I'm having to send my meal back, the table next to ours was also having to send one of their meals back as well. Also over hearing a party in valet who was standing by us while we where leaving, complaining about how terrible there waiters were.   Our Valentines date-dinner was 100% completely ruined! Thanks!  Blatant rude-horrible service and way overpriced sub-par food.  No one should ever have to go out to eat anywhere, especially to a fine dining establishment, and leave hungry because they couldn't even enjoy nor even eat their meal they ordered.  It's beyond me, how this establishment was Frank Sinatra's go-to for Italian cuisine, or any other celebrity for that matter. It surely must be, that they went way downhill since those days. Even after this disaster, we still walked out with an almost $100 bill and we STILL tipped something on top of it.  Ridiculous and never again!",

Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin used to come here!  I had the Linguini Pomodoro, which was phenomenal!   You can't go wrong with their steaks, but I was steaked out!  Try a few appetizers for the table...oh, and a Martini too!  Deserts are great as well.",

The meal was pricey -- $72 for a salmon entree, tea, and Perrer -- for that price, I would have expected a decent size portion that was skillfully cooked.  The chef, however, missed the mark with my Koho Salmon.  I asked for it medium-rare, and received a filet that was very thin on either side (it looked like it had been flattened with a meat hammer), with a sort of thick in the middle. Both ends of the filet were very overcooked, and the middle of the fish was so raw amd uncooked, it probably could have still swam away.  The waiter didn't come back by until after I had already eaten all of the vegetable and when I told him about the problem, he said he could bring the piece of fish back and have them recook it for a minute.  That would have done nothing about the overcooked parts of the fish, and the experience of enjoying a nice meal was just ruined already.  The watier took away my plate, brought my check when asked, and said no more about it.  This was a disappointing evening.",

And she ought to know because Piero's is where all the A listers and casino owners eat when they are in town. The vibe in this place is all \"Good Fellas\".   Now that the scene is set, on to the food. Our captain, Phillipe, guided us through the menu like he's been there for decades(because he has). First suggestion, the Florida stone crab claws. It was like they were flown in on a private jet the day they were served (because they were). So fresh and delicious I cried when I got to the last bite. I had the veal chop parmigiana which was amazing!  So tender I cut it with my fork, and even though it was huge, the balance of sauce and cheese was perfect. Enjoyed it down to the bone. My wife's sea bass was as good as any North Beach San Francisco fish house, prepared perfectly in a garlic butter sauce, unbelievable! Overshadowing all the high dollar \"Celebrity Chef\" restaurants in the casinos, Piero's is a must to get out of the mess and really enjoy a True fine dining experience.  You'll feel like a \"made\" man (or woman). Molto Bene!",

    "text": "We knew we had to make a reservation at Piero's while planning our trip to Vegas. My husbands family raves about this place, and said it was a must. We made reservations about a month ago and got a table for 6:30pm on a Monday night. Which, if you have heard about this place, I'm so lucky to have gotten. There was a real estate convention in town, so the place filled up quickly.   We got seated in the most romantic little corner booth. It is very dim in this place, so it was great to cozy up for our dinner. The staff here is incredible. They are nicely dressed, super polite, and want to make sure you enjoy the entire experience. There really isn't a dress code to this place, but it is nice here, so I suggest if you are visiting to go on the dressier side.  My husband and I ordered the house chianti ($60) but boy is it not your typical house bottle! It was perfection, especially with the meal. He ordered the veal osso buco (their signature dish) and I had the agnolotti with stuffed spinach and light cream sauce. Both came with a salad that had this delicious house vinaigrette that tasted like it had a touch of mustard in it. The veal shank was like melt in your mouth veal. The fettucine that came with it, perfectly drenched in the juice from veal and veggies. My agnolotti was perfection, light pasta to spinach stuffing perfect ratio.   We really did not have much room for dessert, however, when I saw a waitress bring the dessert tray around I HAD to have the creme brulee (which I believe is made with some grand marnier).   I can't rave about this place enough. It is definitely a fine dining place. You will be paying $30-45+ per dish, but so worth it. We can't wait to be back in Vegas to try all the other dishes.",

The dressing was light and wasn't full of iceberg lettuce.  The bread was warm and helped soak up the osso bucco's delicious bone marrow and sauce.  Pasta was perfect too.  I was concerned with the other reviews that the meal would be too salty, but it was actually quite bland (maybe they decided to remove excess salt?).  No salt/pepper was at the bar, so I the salted butter with the bread helped.  Overall, a great meal and really awesome service.  Glad it's so close to my hotel (Las Vegas Marriott) & the Las Vegas Convention Center so I can visit again soon.  Note: only valet parking available.",

    "text": "We made reservations for our Anniversary. A Tuesday night and reservations were for 7:00PM We were seated right away (at the closest seats to the kitchen, ugh). They were quite busy for a Tuesday, so I imagine that the weekends are extremely busy, and you will need reservations. Staff was not super friendly on this particular evening, it seemed like they all were in a bit of a funk. (maybe they had a rough staff meeting before opening) The atmosphere is very \"old Vegas\" and really charming. We had the Fried Calamari appetizer and the Stone Crab Claws to start. The Calamari was not one of my favorites. Very bland and a bit chewy.  The Stone Crab on the other hand was amazing! Some of the best I have had, and nice size too with a good amount of crab meat. I had the Burrata Salad, which was very good. Perfect beef steak tomato on a bed of arugala, with a wonderful Burrata cheese. Our entrees for the evening were the Bone-In Veal Parmigiana (from the daily specials) and Penne Vodka.  The Veal was delicious, tender, and super flavorful. Cooked perfectly and the portion size is huge. The Penne Vodka was good, not the best I have ever had. The prices are a bit high......... I don't mind paying for a good meal! I will always opt for quality over quantity, but I don't think the quality equals what they are charging. The Burrata Salad was good, $16. The Stone Crab was delicious,  $112 for 8 claws. The Veal Chop Parmigiana was also delicious, $54 for a very large chop. The Penne Vodka was okay, $34. Drinks were top shelf and were $20 each.  Oh yeah, they have a \"required\" valet. You can't park your own car. It is complimentary, but I wish I would have know this ahead of time so I would have had cash for a tip!",

Every person on the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone was on top of making sure we were doing fine, never ran out of water and plates and silverware were cleaned in a timely manner. They have a vast amount of specials. We had the spinach ricotta ravioli with a mozzarella fritta. I enjoyed the ravioli but the mozzarella not as much. Entrees came with a house salad. I ordered the veal parm with bone in and it was huge. Very tasty and i enjoyed the mozzarella on this dish much better. My bf had osobuco and it was very tender. My dish came with a side of veg and mashed potatoes. Both tasty and they gave us a complimentary creamed corn. That was tasty as well. After we had dessert which has a huge selection. I got the rum cake which was moist with a mousse like filling. Overall good experience and i value that everyone working there made it even better with how they conduct business.",

Since I'd heard such great things about dining here for one, I wasn't worried at all.   I chose a tiny booth and waited for service. After 15 minutes the bartender arrived and promised a waiter soon. He took my wine order and put in a food order of some crab claws. They were out of the wine I ordered so he gave me the house wine. Mediocre at best. But I chose to let it go and prepared for a great dinner.   Many servers came and went, all promising that the next server would take my dinner order. After an hour the crab claws never came. And the myriad folks swinging by to state that \"someone with the authority to provide food would be by soon\" was simply hysterical.  Then the original host -- the same guy who'd told me the bar was the best place for me -- BOOTED me from my booth saying it was reserved. I pushed back but was told I should have sat \"at the bar\" not \"in the bar\".   The owner arrived and was absolutely horrible. I offered to pay for my crappy glass of wine, but to her credit she comp'ed it. But was still quite nasty.   I'm now sitting at The Wynn enjoying a perfect meal. No more Piero's for me ever again.",

Piero's is one of the few classics left. Their wine by the glass list could be better though. The service is wonderful and the environment is a favorite for people watching.

First let me say the staff, service and food was all a 10. So what's the problem ?  We were seated in the big dining room at a booth. Room was about 40% full mostly of businessmen in white shirts talking business. Piero's is lucky to get alot of consistent strip business.  As our dinner progressed,, more conventioneers filled up the bigger tables and the noise level progressed to a typical Friday night at Buca de Beppo.  What was to be a nice intimate quiet enjoyable dinner didn't quite work out as we planned. On edge, my wife gulped her coffee, ordered an eclair to go and we got the hell out of there. When we got home, I reviewed the bill and we were charged $28 for an eclair?  Seriously????   We wish Piero's continued success.  Don't think we will be on the fast track anytime soon to return as there are so many amazing restaurants in general as well as Italian as well that at least offer a quiet and relaxing atmosphere while dining. I suggest if anyone wants a good meal at Piero's and for it to be quiet, consider sitting down at 5:00 pm before anyone gets there. Maybe try eating at the bar as well",

My friends rate the entrees 6/10, 8/10 and my veal was 7/10. The bread was 10/10--crusty, hot and fresh. Balsamic vinegar and olive oil need to be requested. Alcoholic beverages are on high end of cost. My impression is prices are similar to The Strip. Valet was prompt. Likely won't return, rather I'll visit other similar restaurants to see if the food and service are outstanding. I enjoyed the atmosphere and old school feel.",

    "text": "Repeat performances at restaurants to me are just as important as first impressions.  After coming to a difficult conclusion on where to go Friday evening Super Bowl weekend in Vegas, we decided to revisit old school \"Pieros\" which is previously reviewed here.   After enjoying the 3 piece jazz combo and singer in the front bar this absolutely packed to the gills with local's restaurant sat the 5 of us for dinner.  We were handled by Patrick who took our drink orders and Manolo who handled our food orders.  It appeared since we had some drinks at the bar and only a couple of us were drinking wine by the glass that they lost interest in us as not the big ticket table they wanted tonight. Strike 1!  After the specials were presented 5 entrees were selected. All come with their house salad and potatoes & Vegetables.  2 Veal Parmigana's, 2 Veal de chef & 1 veal Saltamboca rounded out the list with 2  1/2 orders of pasta and a soup.    Let's start with the salad which was ok but nothing special to say the least.  We move to the $14.00 bowl of soup which was again nothing special and here the waiter never brings the missing salad for the 1 person who had an appetizer even though it was requested.    On we go to the entrees the Veal Parm's were pretty good but sides of potatoes & Vegetables with Veal Parm UGH.  The Veal De Chef which was covered with a couple of roasted peppers and cheese was virtually tasteless as was the Saltamboca which was burnt prosciutto on top of thin veal sauteed which was neither tender or very good.  The Sides were ice cold a mashed potatoes & grilled carrot & greens.  Both sides of pasta were POOR simple as that.  Let us also state that 45 minutes past from salad to Entree which was completely ridiculous.  PASS on deserts or coffee.  Not quite sure what transpired in the 8 months since I've been here only to say that this traveler can find much better dining options in this great city than this place.  This one gets the Yellow X - Knock it down start over, it has outlived its usefulness.",

We had a reservation but we had to sit in the bar and wait. They were a little late. When we got seated we were in one of those split booths where you are almost sitting with the other party. Star one removed! I asked to be put in a quiet area. We then waited 30 minutes before anyone talked to us about the menu. Star two removed! The waiter was Scottish or something and I couldn't understand him, but wanting to try the food at this so called great Italian restaurant I already knew what I wanted scaloppine parmigiana my wife had the la zuppa di pesce. We also got shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. My wife got a lemon drop and when the waiter poured it into the glass it splashed all over us. Star three removed! We received our shrimp cocktail that had huge fresh shrimp on it but the cocktail sauce had so much horseradish that it made your eyes water. The main course came my veal was okay the sauce was bland and was accompanied by mash potatoes? I didn't get that. My wife's seafood soup was also bland and had no flavor. So I am taking away star # four. I wanted to give Piero's no stars but yelp makes you rate at least one star. We only saw the waiter once when he spit out the menu and we were never asked how we liked the food or given the least bit of attention. Star # five gone. Pieros is poor Italian cuisine, overpriced and horrible service.",

It's off the strip and I think the food, service and prices are better than any of the hotel restaurants, and believe me, I've tried just about all of them.  My favorite dish there is the Osso Bucco.  It is the best I've ever had.  All of their food is fantastic and you'll enjoy a fine dining experience.  I highly recommend it!",

With Don and Bernie behind the bar you will never get a bad drink, and they always know the best glass or bottle of wine to go with your meal. The wait staff is also amazing one in particular is a gentlemen by the name of Tim, he knows the history of Vegas and always has a great story to tell.  The one and only reason that Peiro's only got three stars (it truly deserves all five) from me is that, I went for dinner last night and I was sitting at the bar. About 3/4 of the way through the meal I hear F*ck this and don't you ever F*cking do that again. It was one of the most unprofessional and inappropriate things I have ever seen in a restaurant. The individual that I would consider head of house I believe his name is Evan has one of the wait staff backed into a corner yelling and ripping papers out of the staffs hand. The four or five people around me at the bar to include myself got extremely uncomfortable to the point where I asked for the check to leave. When Evan realized the scene he was making, he stopped and then came over to apologize, that's when you could tell he had been drinking pretty heavily and was slurring his speech and couldn't make complete sentences. As much as I fell on love with this place I will be hard pressed to sit down and have a dinner or drinks if I see that manager again, which is a complete shame. Don, Bernie, Tim thank you for always welcoming me, giving me an unbeatable dining experience; I'm sorry that all of your hard work and dedication was ruined by what I would consider a self entitled prick.  Evan,  My apologies; I'm sure your a great manager and I'm sorry for the personal attack. I will continue to recommend the restaurant and the amazing experience you get from this one and only type of place. I just hope something like that never happens again.",

    "text": "The quintessential Vegas Italian restaurant. Walked in last night and the owner Fred Glusman is sitting at the bar. Seated in the main dining room so we could watch the game. Service is immediate, bread, butter, drink orders, water all happen. After which the waiter recites the evenings specials.  All 3 of us settle on the famous Osso Buco with fettuccine & garbage Caesar salad.  Unbelievable!!  A great bottle of Cabernet. What else do you need?   Far superior to most of the hotel high dollar famous chefs.",

    "text": "I have gone to vegas, for work, more times than I would have liked. This is where I go to get away from the city and relax with an excellent italian meal. The rest of the city seems full of over-sensationalized celebrity chef places; but this is where I bring people.   If you are looking for a regular pasta dish; then I must suggest the puttanesca.   If you are looking for a meat dish then you absolutely must try the oso bucco.",
