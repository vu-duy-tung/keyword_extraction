The service is actually worse than the food. Tried to get some quick 'To-Go' stir fry veggies and an apple crumble dessert. Their website forbids simple customization which should have been my first clue that I was making a mistake. I placed my order and typed my 'DAIRY FREE' indication in the place of my 'Pick-Up' name. Apparently that was not clear enough. Order wrong, good cold, they didn't honor the coupon they emailed the same day. In a recap, Go to China One instead. They are right up the street.",

It has been some time since I have been to this particular location.    We rolled in about the middle of the lunch hour and were seated in quick fashion.  The lay out was pretty much as i had remembered it.  The service was friendly and hardly overwhelmed.  I did silently question why the service was not fluid and there were  rather long pauses between drink refills, the appetizer and meal, and check.  We ordered up some crab wontons.  They were tasty.  The GF had a the combo lo mein.  It was tasty.  I had my honey shrimp.  It was also tasty.  Over the years it seems the price has remained the same but the portions have become smaller.  With my craving satisfied and partaking in an A-OK experience, it could be a few more years before I return again.",

I've had far better food at pei wei and even little hole in the wall mom and pop Chinese food places in mini strip malls than what we got tonight for over $40!   We ordered pick up...Kung pao chicken and honey walnut shrimp. It was horrible! The chicken tasted like it was rolled in BBQ sauce, had hardly any onions, no peanuts, and barely enough sauce to coat the chicken, much less enough to mix with the rice! No flavor...It tasted dry and old. The honey walnut shrimp was absolutely disgusting. It was shrimp coated in what tasted like mayonnaise and tossed with some balls of honeydew melon and maybe 4 walnuts. No flavor at all. It tasted like something you would serve cold at a picnic.  I would take panda express any day over the crap they served us tonight!  What a shame!  We hadn't been there in a couple of years, and we definitely will not be back again!",

It was very crowded at 1130am, and this was due to the fact that the servers crowded everyone into one side of the restaurant. The food was okay, tasted kind of like Panda Express with nice plates. I ordered the ahi tuna roll, shrimp with lobster sauce and a side of brown rice, fried green beans, orange chicken with white rice, two teas, and a tossed salad. The best part of the meal was the salad. All of the items were tasteless. My server was amazing though and made sure to check in on my friend and I intermittently, our drinks were never empty.  I'm taking away 2 stars because the dining area was dark and crowded. 3 stars for the waiter and how quickly our food was brought out to us. Bill came up to about $65 with tip, not worth it IMO. I won't eat here again,",

You can call in your order or order online like I do. Compared to other places that offer curbside Chang's has it down. I'm never left waiting passed the promised pick up time and the person bringing out the food is courteous and goes over the whole order ensuring it's all there.   The pork fried dumplings are super bomb. Great flavor and highly addicting. Chicken lettuce wraps from here are some of the best I've had. I change up between a few different beef dishes but it's always something spicy, beefy, tasty, and over white rice.

I always get the same thing when I go to PF Changs - Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Double Pan Fried Beef Noodles.  However, they are now offering a Pre-Fix menu for 2 for $39.99 and my noodles were not on the menu.  I decided to be brave, and try something new.  Our waiter and I had already created a rapport over my indecision on my drink choice, so I when I asked him about my meal choice he told me to try the Mongolian beef instead while my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Chicken.  He said that I would never want my pan fried noodles again after the Mongolian Beef....so I took his word and tried something new.  He apparently told the cook to make mine extra crispy without asking my preference first - little did he know, I LOVE crispy grilled beef bits. I char my Korean BBQ because I love those burned edges so much (even though I order steaks med rare) so when a full plate of little sweet charred pieced of beef came to my table with a thick sauce I was in heaven.  Our waiter (Nicholas) even suggested next time how I order the Mongolian beef a bit spicier with asparagus to really fit in with my preferences and he was spot on about how I had told my boyfriend how I would like it a bit spicier next time and came with beans instead of  shallots.  It was like he read my mind!",

They were also out of green tea.  How can a chinese restaurant be out of green tea??  Unacceptable!!!!  Very disappointed.  Needless to say, we won't be back......",

I guess this place is fine for high school graduations, Mothers Day, and dad's birthday, you know, when you want to go out for a \"nice\" dinner (but not an overly expensive one).

PS. dont bother ordering the asian pear mojito. it tasted like a regular mojito.   will i be back? only if another giftcard found its way into my hands.",

She had a gift certificate she wanted to use, and we went in for a late dinner (I'm talking an hour before they close late). We decided to get a special they had for two people; two soups, two starters, two entrees, and your choice of two desserts or shareable dessert. She ordered the Orange Peel Chicken for the main dish, and I got the Orange Peel Shrimp.  The Shrimp was very tasty, and had a little kick to it. We shared some spring rolls with the house sauces, and got separate desserts. The down side was the desserts were little shot glasses full of cake. It wasn't that much. We should have asked for a shareable one, it would have been bigger. The staff was very nice considering we were there pretty late, and overall the food was alright.",

He said to me very smuggly \"oh.. well have a good night.\" I'm here again on a saturday afternoon, the place is half empty, and the service is just as bad.

I love the sauce, the tofu isnt slimy or anything, great texture, nice fresh lettuce, wonderful!  Then for entree we got the crispy honey shrimp and the orange peel shrimp.  Both were fresh, amazing flavors and well cooked.  Served with steamed rice and the waiter insisted we get extra rice so we could take it home for leftovers, so nice!    Then he recommended the raspberry cheesecake with caramel on top and also the chocolate chip dessert.  Both were really good.

The food I ordered was equally as pleasing.  I went for lunch and ordered Ginger Chicken with Brocolli and brown rice in the lunch sized portion. I was worried the lunch portion would be too small but it turned out to be just right.  My meal came out fast, hot and fresh. The chicken was tender and the brocolli still slightly crisp. Mixing the sauce and the brown rice was a good way to go. The egg flower soup at the beginning of the meal was good in its own right but had a flavor I am not used to.  I ordered hot green tea. They were out of the regular organic and so they brought me tropical green tea instead. It was a little sweeter and fruitier than the tea I really wanted but it was still good. I had that pot empty by the end of my meal. To finish off my meal I ordered tiramisu for dessert. This was the only disappointing part of the meal. The taste was good but it was frozen. I've never had frozen tiramisu before. Perhaps I was just there too early and it had not defrosted yet. Whatever the case my overall experience was favorable. I got a good meal, hot tea and dessert for $17.51. Not bad. And I had a $25 gift card that now has $7.49 remaining. Maybe I'll go back and get a dessert trio.",

Me nor my children(4) had ever eaten there before but my husband had but not the location on Rampart and not in the last 5 1/2yrs.  We arrived on a Saturday without reservations (they take and plz make reservations before hand) a little 5:30pm.  The hostess greeted us and advised us of a 40-60 minute wait.  We were in no rush. We waited all of 40 minutes , despite some ppl walked in with no reservation or in parties of 2 or 3 were seated in booths large enough to accommodate 6ppl 2 adults and 4 kids. I was highly dissatisfied where they seated us and requested a manager. Dave the manager listened and re-sat us, not to mention he sent over lettuce wraps which were  phenomenal! David our server who I planned on tipping only 15% because i was livid, earned every bit of the 22% tip. David the server was versed in menu items, drinks, and was so personable we enjoyed ourselves!  Dave the manager was equally as knowledgeable if not more and earned our returned business. Dave was on the floor the entire time checking in on the guest and clearly a support to his team! Awesome food, awesome service, will definitely come back!",

    "text": "I gotta say, I have been a fan of PF Changs for some time as a go to option for \"higher end\" Asian food. I was let down this time though . Granted we stopped in during several of the largest trade shows in Las Vegas, so the restaurant was PACKED, but it just didn't seem like anyone was on their game. My friend and I (no, it's not what you think!) stopped in to get looking for some decent, non casino food and we left really wanting. This is one of the \"smaller\" locations it seemed in both parking lot and restaurant size, so that probably magnified the difficulties they had. Our experience started off when we pulled in to the parking lot and were greeted by the valet telling us the only option, other than across the street was to valet our \"big ole truck\". This wasn't a big deal as we didn't want to walk anyways. However, we were a bit irked when the valet told us we needed to get out car, or at least the key within the next hour and a half as they would be closing at 10ish, valet included. I almost voiced an opposition to continuing in as I did not want to be rushed in what already seemed like a packed restaurant...This is VEGAS for crying out loud! No worries. We did get seated pretty fast as there was only two of us. The waiter definitely got this place an additional star as he was attentive and informative. He got out orders in and going in great order and stopped by several times to refill us on drinks. We ordered a few standbys, Kung Pow chicken and Crispy beef. What a let down! The chicken appeared to be sauteed chicken and peanuts with a little sauce, and my beef was too chewy for my liking. Both made us think that perhaps we had gotten the PF Changs frozen entree's they now sell in the supermarkets? The highlight for me was the house ginger beer. I must have had three of these damn things. I enjoy a good, unique beer and this was killer! This was a light tasting heff type unfiltered beer with a fantastic sweet/spicy aftertaste of genuine ginger. I might hit up the local PF Change to see if they have this on it's own. I guess we went in hoping for average to above average and left feeling we got below average from a restaurant chain that makes it's reputation on being above average. I'll give them a second chance, but in a town with almost as many eating options as ways to loose your money, why try again?",

Nobody came back by. 35 minutes passed and finally got the attention of the waitress - we had to walk over to her and ask her what is taking so long and if she could please box it up now so we can take it to go. The manager came over to give some excuse that some of the food was waiting but they messed up on part of the order so was trying to fix it. Our food finally came \"to go\" (now 45 minutes later!) and the waitress asked if we would like our drinks to go. Gave me the check. I looked it over and ended up paying for the entire meal. Even the sodas which we didn't get one to go since my husband at this time had already left.  This place is terrible customer service. Once we got home the food was so nasty. Couldn't eat it!! $55 down the drain! Thanks!!!!",

Service and food: 5* I wasn't extremely hungry but I chose to order the chili-garlic green beans market side as an appetizer and their new Hokkien Street Noodles for my main course.  The green beans were in my surprise extremely flavorful and not as spicy as expected. They were wok fried to perfection with a light crunch.  The street noodles were ok. I enjoyed them enough to eat the majority of it, but I will probably opt out next visit. They had good flavor and I small bite of spice. There was a combination of chicken, shrimp, egg, onion and julienned vegetables in a light curry sauce.   Restaurant: 3* Walking up to the door you see nothing but dying plants and over grown weeds. The waiting area was clean but when we were sat the booths were cracked and ripped. Every time I would move I would get scratched by my seat. Small details, especially simple garden work makes a negative impression. And with the booths, I know furniture is expensive, but I was extremely uncomfortable during my meal and I probably won't come back to this location until it gets fixed.",

After last night we will NEVER eat there again. They hype up the free delivery service but we placed our order at 8:45pm it was 10:00pm so we decided to pick up our food..... well with our luck the food was already on our way home.   The food was cold and the pad tai noodles WEREN'T COOKED! After spending almost $50 to have a nice night in, all ruined. We're patient and give several opportunities but this just crossed the line. The only edible thing in our order was the wonton soup- it was delicious.  If you're reading this DON'T GET YOUR FOOD DELIVERED. As enticing the free delivery may be.",

He knew his menu extremely well gave recommendations and even made some good points to try sauces extra on the side that worked out AWSOME for the kids. On top of all of that food was hot prompt and exactly as ordered. I can highly recommend this location and only give props out when they are earned and this place has earned from phone call to host to wait staff kitchen staff all the way thru. In addition the place was super clean and well on its way to being a family favorite stopping point while in town great job 5",

    "text": "EPIC FAIL on every level.  What a disappointment!  The service was inept, uncaring, and annoying (Pro Tip: if you are a server and I don't know you, don't call me \"honey\" and \"darlin\". Professional servers in good restaurants don't do that. Seriously.), and most of the food barely edible.  We were two couples, there on a night when the restaurant was almost empty except for a few tables celebrating birthdays, so the staff was not overwhelmed with work.  When we were seated, the server took our drinks order (1 Pinot Gris, 2 Moscatos, 1 beer) and said she would also bring us 4 glasses of water. The water never came, it took an eternity to get the drinks, and she got them wrong;  I ordered the Pinot Gris, and she gave me a Moscato, which I detest.  Meanwhile, the other lady drank some of what she thought was her Moscato, and literally spit out the Pinot Gris (the wine isn't bad, but this lady doesn't like dry white wine any more than I like sweet, fruity wines).  The server seemed to have vanished, so we had to ask a non-English speaking busboy to get her so we could get the wines changed and, again, it took a very long time for her to arrive.  She seemed annoyed at having to correct her mistake, but finally agreed to replace the mis-delivered wines.  And - AGAIN - it took an eternity for the bar to pour two tiny carafes of wine and have them delivered to us, well after the entrees had arrived. The bright note was the Tempura Calamari and Vegetable appetizer, which was really wonderful, but it all went downhill from there.  The other appetizer, Lettuce Wraps with Chicken, was just okay, so we ate some but didn't finish it.  But NOBODY liked their entrees.  What was billed as Filet Mignon in a black pepper and butter sauce turned out to be chopped meat in a COLD metal bowl with vegetables.  The Shrimp & Lobster Rice dish was so spicy that the poor woman who spit out the Pinot Gris could barely choke down any of her meal.  My Chicken Egg Rolls were cold, soggy and tasteless.  I ate only half of a roll, but declined to take the rest home as I could not imagine it would improve with age.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant.  We have eaten at P.F. Chang's for years, all around the country. We had been at this location with the same couple recently and loved it.  But after last night's fiasco, I doubt that any of us will return.  I hope this is not an indication of how the national chain is running, and that the local management fixes their problems before they lose more customers.",

The food is about the same as your typical Chinese restaurant in any strip mall, but twice the price and smaller portions.  Also, the menu is very limited, with a lot fewer choices than the typical Chinese restaurant.  PFC gets three stars because the food was not awful, but I can't think of a single reason to recommend it to anyone.",

We have so many choices here in Vegas, so I need the incentive to try something new. We checked first with the waiter to define what entrees would qualify for the free deal and were told that we could order a lunch special, a regular entree or even the specialty salads. My hubby ordered the Honey Shrimp lunch deal with a side egg roll.   Lunch was served promptly. The noodle dish is made with rice noodles and I also requested more chicken instead of shrimp. There were lots of veggies and ample chicken. It was tasty, but likely will not order it again because it was too salty for me. The lunch special was tiny tiny. My husband was not fully satisfied even after sampling my dish too. It is so hard to feel a lunch is worthwhile in this town after going to buffets, especially with loyalty cards and 2-1. We probably won't be back for awhile.",

Chang's restaurants across the country. The review will be focused specifically on the unique qualities of this location, although it's notable that the quality, variety, and overall enjoyability of the food are all excellent.   For this location, I knocked one star off because on a few occasions we've had an exorbitant wait, or had mistakes with our food. The staff is always polite and considerate, and even on a weekend night they (usually) being the food without too much of a wait.   I really enjoy the layout of this restaurant. There's no awkward corner tables where you're hidden and forgotten about, and it doesn't feel overly crowded even with a full house. There's plenty of bar seating, and the decorations are tasteful and lovely. They do a good job of keeping the sun and bright light from being overly intrusive with shades on the windows and tinted doors, which I appreciate. It keeps the restaurant open and well lit without being super annoying or sitting in an unfortunate spot where you're blinded.   Even with the many restaurant options in the Boca Park area, I wouldn't hesitate to revisit this P.F. Chang's.",

We were given water and asked if were interested in any drinks. I ordered wine as usual and my friend ordered a cocktail. We were both pleasantly happy with the drink selection.   We ordered the eggplant and the tofu lettuce wraps. Both were really good... Not overly salty like pervious visits to the location. Portions were large enough for us to just share the two items.

The best thing they have going for them is the online ordering with curbside pickup. I can place my repeat custom order in a couple clicks, drive up to one of the curbside parking spots for pickup, and they come to me with my food very quickly.   The service here has always been very good, and the gluten free menu is pretty large so I can convince myself that I'm sticking with my Paleo diet even though I think we all know cavemen didn't have Chinese takeout.

The wait for me in the past has been up to a 2 hour wait so I always call ahead of time to make sure I wont have to wait too long when getting there. Parking is another thing the lot can be pretty full at times but, when people know where good food is they tend to gather!  We like getting the \"Four-Course Meal For Two For $39.99\". You get your choice of 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 small desserts. For $1.95-$3.95 you can upgrade to 1 larger dessert but for us we like choosing our own smaller ones that are included in the price already.   I love their \"Egg Drop Soup\". It is some of the best I have ever had. I usually always start out with \"Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps\". The lettuce is always so fresh and crisp and the chicken tastes so darn good. I just can't get enough of the lettuce wraps! We also got \"Pork Fried Dumplings\". These are chocked full of delicious flavored pork. If you like dumplings then these are a must and they have veggie too. For my main meal I usually get \"Crispy Honey Chicken\". The chicken comes with crispy rice sticks under the chicken and u tell them to leave that off so I can mix my white rice with the chicken, yum! For the dessert menu I would eat one of everything it all sounds good! The dessert I did choose this time was \"Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake\". Sounds good right? It was just so-so. I wasn't upset at all it was perfectly edible the flavor just didn't add up to the name so I will try a different one next time.  I had a \"Strawberry Daiquiri\" that was $6.50 and delicious.  There is a outdoor patio if you want to eat outside.  Check out their website. They have a \"Warrior Rewards\" that gives you freebies from time to time. Just for signing up you get a free order of lettuce wraps!",

I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, and not a huge fan of chains, so though I have lived near other locations in many cities, it has never been high on my list of places to try!  I was actually pleasantly surprised. I had wonton soup, steamed pork dumplings, and the chopped chicken salad. You get a choice of dressing with the salad - ginger or sesame. I had the sesame and it was to die for! I am going to check whether they sell this by the jar, and if so, I'll definitely buy some. The food wasn't anything amazing (I thought it was the same quality you get at any generic Chinese place), but perfectly fine.  I probably wouldn't go back and eat in the actual restaurant, just because of the generic chain feel of the place. But the pick-up at the bar was easy, the staff was friendly, and it was pretty decent Chinese takeout. I'll definitely do it again!",

    "text": "So yesterday, 3/16/11, my best friend's roommate, Lawrence T. asked me out; unsure of where we should go for the meal part, I suggested \"the Chinese restaurant by your house.\" I meant the Pearl Wok To Go <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/pearl-wok-to-go-las-vegas#hrid:jcxX6SDXMY-AXrGCElXEYQ\">yelp.com/biz/pearl-wok-t...</a> (which I had back on Christmas Eve.) While driving around I spotted it and he said, \"really? I wanted to take you to a real restaurant, not fast food. Let's just go to P.F. Chang's.\"   Anyway, we head on over and walk right in. It was stuffy and loud inside so we jumped at the opportunity to sit out on the patio. It was nice outside and the weather was gorgeous. There was a little boy that spent the entire time dancing and jumping around an empty table and waiving at cars. That was pretty entertaining.   We ordered - he had orange peel chicken and an iced tea, I had Mongolian beef... but with lamb instead, with extra chili pods, and water. The orange peel chicken was just okay, and my dish came with a canapy of green onions and not too much meat, although it was delicious. The \"mild sauce\" that our waitress, Ashley, made was, according to Lawrence, \"tasteless.\" Ashley was a little... eh. My water glass was empty most of the meal, and that drives me crazy.   For $35 + $10 tip, the food is just not worth the price. PF Chang's has definitely gone down hill. Although I had a great time with Lawrence, we could have had just as good a time at a cheaper restaurant.",

This the second time, a PF Chang, has served us a mediocre quality of food..I can go to the neighborhood Chinese Buffet and have a much better meal for half the price.   Since we were in Las Vegas, visiting, and there are thousands of restaurants, I was surprised at how robotic the waiter was and how below average, greasy and tasteless the food was.  I wish I had my $60 back!!  Advice:  Save your money, or go to your neighborhood Chinese joint!  There is no justification for charging those prices and delivering a crappy experience....Very upset and disappointed.",

    "text": "Eh. What a complete letdown. And honestly, waste of money.  First things first, the positives. The service was great. Our server was super nice and patient with us. The owner (I'm assuming) went around the restaurant, making sure everyone was happy and was served. The space itself was nice and spacious.  Aaand on to the not so good. Mainly the food. I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but you know, at least decent food. This was not decent. The family and I got: calamari, Singaporean street noodles, Buddha's Feast, and the Chino-Latino Pineapple pork. The calamari was alright, bland and wasn't crispy. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the calamari at all. It almost overpowered it. The Singaporean noodles had potential, but it was wayy too salty. I ordered the Buddha's Feast, expecting it to be like a Buddha's delight sort of thing: veggies with brown sauce. What I got: steamed vegetables with some pieces of tofu. NO SAUCE. Like, wtf? I wouldn't have gotten that if I knew I was only getting steamed vegetables. I just doused it with some soy sauce because I needed some kind of flavor. The Chino-Latino pineapple pork wasn't bad at all actually. It the pork was a bit crisp, and the pineapple salsa ish topping was good. Also, my sister ordered this coconut refresher (can't remember the exact name) and it was just like coconut milk out of the can with a shitton of sugar. Not good.  With the quality of the food being not good, the price they charge is not worth it. At all. You're pretty much paying for the ~ambiance~. All four of us were disappointed by the end of the meal, and it was a consensus that we could get much better Chinese food at any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. My brother even said that Panda Express food is better. And I agreed. It was that bad.  So overall, not good, not worth it, just go to Chinatown.",

MUHAHAHAHA!!! Service is quite important to this place, and I have never not had a fast, friendly, couterous, and professional server at a table or at the bar. Everything here is awesome, and there are some sushi choices for those of you who prefer to eat nearly living things. Haven't had the nerve to try their tacos yet. I do have one beef. They used to give you complimentary fried wonton noodles and three delish dipping sauces. Suddenly, they just stopped. There was no warning, no rhyme, and no reason. There's no message on the tables and nothing mentioned in the menu. You can still get it if you ask for it, but I think that's an underhanded way of cutting costs or time spent at a table.",

    "text": "OK, I don't want to hear that PF Chang's is not authentic Chinese.....everybody knows that.  The family enjoys coming here.  It's been a while for us, so we decided to have a family night out.  We ordered the Tofu Lettuce Wraps and Crispy Green Beans to get the night started.  Both were awesome as usual.  One thing about PFC is that they rarely screw up the appetizers.....I can always count on a solid appetizer.  Their entrees however are going downhill.  One of my favorite dishes is the Dali Chicken, which is their spiciest Chicken dish.  When it came out, it looked dry and tough.....and it was.  You can almost see how dry it is from the picture I took. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw?select=vefoPIx8FPxegrVmSyeWmg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/T3AS...</a> Damn.....why can't they keep up the consistent quality like they do with their appetizers?!  I also don't like how they only give you a small bowl of Rice.....I have to ask for a 2nd bowl as soon as it's delivered to the table, otherwise I won't get my 2nd bowl before I'm done with my entree.  Overall, it was a nice dinner with the fam.....everyone enjoyed their meal and although mine wasn't perfect, I wasn't going to let it ruin a nice night out.  Return Factor - 67%",

My fried rice was shrimpless... i didnt realize there wasnt but a few shrimp until the person eating the beef, who was starving still, asked why i ordered plain rice? Im so discouraged because we drove 10 miles to try it. I drop 20 at Panda and get three entrees and its a lot.

A friend and I walked into a relatively empty restaurant and asked to be seated, the hostess took us to a booth that wasn't clean.... and then to a second that was even worse. On a Friday night where you have a light crowd, WHY WOULDN'T the tables be clean? After several nasty tables and excuses, we were finally seated in a suitable booth.  Our server Tommy arrives and greets us with a warm and congenial smile that began to improve the evening.   We proceed to order appetizers that arrived cold and entrees that were overcooked. Tommy was doing such a good job we didn't even bother to complain, we just asked for the check and left. When I paid, I gave Tommy $60 cash and my card for the $8-$10 balance and I left a 40% tip in appreciation of his service.  My friends and I left, once I got home and checked my card balance, I realized that I'd been charged another $81.71 on my credit card!!! I proceeded to call the restaurant and I ended up speaking to Kevin the GM..... let me tell you, what a waste of humanity that guy is! When I explain what happened, he couldn't find the charge and made several excuses. Kevin asked for my phone number and said he'd look into the charge and call me tomorrow. For a GM, he was completely clueless and offered no reasonable explanation for how this could've occurred.  I realize that PF Chang's is a chain restaurant and you receive assembly line food, but I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and unique spins the put on conventional Chinese cuisine.  This location has been a disappointment to me and my family on several occasions with slow service and poorly maintained tables, but we let it go because it's local and pretty tasty.....However, I have to draw the line tonight after walking into an EMPTY AND FILTHY restaurant only to be IMPROPERLY OVERCHARGED! Then to have an inept manager make up excuses???   PF Chang's should look in the mirror and figure out how to fix these issues..... FAST! The Summerlin community won't put up with it, we'll eat elsewhere.",

ALMOST ANOTHER TEN MINUTES ON WAIT ALL I WANT IS SOME MONGOLIAN BEEF! I ended up having to go to Panda Express. This has happened more than once.

So we are regular customers and enjoy dining in at this restaurant but we had a huge shocker when we ordered take out due to how small and different the portions were. When we dine in the portions are huge and we never finish all our food. When we ordered over 160$ worth of food for take out we were not even able to feed 3 adults with the 2 lettuce wrap orders. 4 entrees, and 4 kids meals. It was crazy and when I called about it I was told it was due to the BLACK containers and that they just \"seem\" like smaller portions. Then I got another excuse that the size of the take out box was to big. The food was also cold. This was supposed to be easier to order take out. We had a pick up time at 5:26pm. We didn't even get acknowledged till 5:52pm. When we called in The manager was kind enough to comp us one entree but by the time we were done calling them to fix it and picked up the comped food everything was cold and it was just such a hassle. I will not ever waste my money and order take out. So if you want the food it's great but dine in other wise you won't get your moneys worth.",

I'm sure they looked far and wide to find a server that was so incredibly RUDE!!! And when we waited, and waited, and waited, did ANYONE come out and tell us what was going on? Not for 45 minutes. They made the order wrong and we're redoing it. So we wait ANOTHER 15 minutes! Yep. Look no further for the worst service ever!!!",

    "text": "I usually bragged about the PF Chang's Chinese Bistro on Rampart & West Charleston here in Las Vegas for their great & friendly service at the bar but yesterday I decided to take my 16 month old niece with me for lunch so we were seated at the dining area.  The female server, who was young, longhaired & wearing glasses must have been a new one. She talked very fast that I couldn't hardly understand what she was talking about.  I asked for orange juice that I will share with my niece. She came back with a tall paper cup that's half filled with oj & served it to my niece. With a long straw & tall cup, it was very difficult for my niece to maneuver & figure out how to drink from it so I requested for a smaller cup.  The server was hardly visible & of she showed up in the dining area, she's always with the other diners. I was going to request for a glass of water for myself but couldn't find or catch her. She didn't check on us to see how we're doing or if we need anything, she seemed to be overwhelmed!  She served me brown rice which I wasn't given an option when I was placing my order. My niece was getting restless & I was already thinking of going to the receptionist to ask to let our server know that we'll just take our food to go but the server showed up but busy again with another diners.  Within minutes our food arrived so we ended up staying to dine. At the end of our meal, again, it took awhile for our server to show up, I asked her for boxes & our check. We needed a total of 4 boxes but she only brought us 3 boxes. Instead of waiting again for her, I just put 2 different kinds of noodles in 1 box. She didn't offer to box our food as it was difficult for me to watch my niece & do the boxing.  I was extremely disappointed & dissatisfied with our service",

I know it's embarrassing for an Asian guy like me to enjoy dining at P.F Chang. Paul Fleming Chang that is! That's as authentic as it gets.   There's really nothing you can complain about, the service here is top notch. Food comes out like a well orchestrated symphony. There's only 2 things I order here and highly recommend. Ma Po Tofu and Kung Pao Shrimp. Both highly addictive items! I'm not sure if it's the saltiness, or the crunchiness or the combination of both.  The Tofu comes with crispy steamed broccoli to make you feel better about yourself for the meal.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying We loved this place! We'd Eat here for dinner and lunch on numerous occasions and the food would be on point! It's been a few months that we've eaten here so we decided to take out dinner on our last visit it's a shame to say it was the WORST It was about an hour before closing that We had ordered our food for take out, we ordered the Chicken lettuce wraps , Crispy green beans , Changs spicy chicken, and an order of chicken and egg fried rice with no veggies (made that very clear)  ..... What we got? I honestly couldn't even tell you. We live no more then 5 minutes from this place they told us about 25 min it would be ready , when we open our food the green beans were cold and soggy like they picked them off someone's plate that left an hour ago the rice was hard and stuck together like it's been under the heat lamp with vegetables in it no taste what so ever. The changs spicy chicken was bland and the lettuce wraps lets just say I'm not ordering them any more! We called after our pick up and spoke to Erin the manager I told her I will gladly bring the food back we didn't even really touch anything . she apologized and because their kitchen was unfortunately closing and the restaurant was closing as well she could refund our money back onto a Pf Changs gift card ... I was very appreciative but that's not a chance I want to even take going back. So we had picked up a Thai chicken salad from tropical smoothie that was 10x better then what we were served! Beyond disappointed 50$ sitting on a card we most likely won't use.",

The only Chinese I saw were statues decorating the place. And the menus are as easy to read as panda express menus.   We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps,( fresh and crispy) the Chang's chicken ( sweet & sour) and the shrimp with lobster sauce. ( my favorite) Food was delicious. I really liked everything we tried, although it was a little too salty or to MSG-ish?  Service was great! (Another sign this is not an authentic Chinese restaurant.) we had 3 servers! One got us drinks, one took our order, one delivered the food. Wow, I hope they share tips.  The overall experience was good enough to come back and to recommend this place to friends. This may not be an authentic Chinese restaurant, but is definitely an authentic P.F. Chang!",

    "text": "Until March 2012, I was not a big PF Changs Fan.  Sure I like the Lettuce Wraps and the Spare Ribs but I have always felt it was overpriced, overcrowded and pretentious.  I tend to avoid places where you have to wait in line for the privilege of dropping a C-note on dinner and drinks for 2 and the food isn't even real chinese.  And then, as if drawn by oriental mystery, I found myself with my lovely wife who is a PF Changs fan hearing myself say  hmm, Lettuce Wraps sound good, surprised it came out of my mouth.    So off to Rampart we go.  Past the wild rearing horses greeting us and reminding me that this might not be my best choice.  Until.....................  Dinner for 2 for $40.00.  I know I know, many other chains are offering similar or even better priced bargin dinners.  And the old saying you get what you pay for usually holds True.  I thought, ok. It is a trick, small portions, limited menu choices but I will give it a try, for my wife. Well this may be the exception.   The popular items are on the 2 for $40 menu.  Lettuce Wraps, Orange Chicken etc.  Not everything but enough choices to make it worth it.    You start with soup, we upgrade to the Wonton for some yummy starts.  Then you get 1 appetizer (Lettuce Wraps are a staple.) 2 entrees and either 3 mini deserts or one large piece of cake for a slight upgrade price.  The bowl of soup is huge and we have always ended up taking some home.  The portions appear the same size as the regular dining and of course the same great taste.  The Mongolian Beef is one of our favorites and the Crispy Honey Shrimp and Chicken are awesome.  Unless you are super hungry, there will be enough leftovers for 1-2 lunches.  Make yourself the envy of your lunch crowd at work by enjoying a chinese feast the next day.  I have now become a fan of PF Changs and give them a resounding Xie xie or M goi.  Not to mention the service was fantastic.  We had an amazing server who has been there 7 years.  I hope the restaurant appreciates what they have in this girl.  The only think keeping this from a 5 star rating is that I am from the East Coast where corner store chinese food is better than anything you can find in Vegas and half the price.",

I was looking to order the Korean lunch bowl and noticed from the picture the egg comes out over easy. Im 36 weeks pregnant and I need all my food to be fully cooked. I asked the server if I could get my eggs fully cooked and his response was they couldn't modify the lunch bowls at all. I said let me talk to your manager, im sure they could accommodate a pregnant women! The Manager on duty who came out was name Kevin and he told me the same thing and came up with this lame reasoning as to why he couldn't accommodate me. Im looking into reaching out to corporate to share my experience. If you are pregnant, do not stop in Here! Please do yourself a favor to stop in somewhere else to eat!!",

Tiffany was very good to us and the food was AMAZING! My wife had the black pepper shrimp and I had the spicy chicken. Both were outstanding in flavor, freshness and preparation. The pork pot stickers were excellent. She recommends the Alamos merlot, which was fantastic. The GM, Chris, stopped by to make sure we were well cared for and we were. Thanks Chris for having a fantastic P.F. Changs for us to return to again and again!",

Our party of four was seated slightly before our reservation time despite a packed house with a line extending out the door.  Our drink order was taken right away and promptly delivered. Appetizers were also quickly served and delicious.   The entrees tasted great and freshly made. Desert was excellent as well. Various staff members pitched in seamlessly and made a pleasing dining experience for us.  I've had a couple of bad experiences in this location before and I was looking for something to fault. I couldn't find a thing. The management team team has certainly done their best here.   Special kudos go to our server, Ruth, for her cheery attitude, prompt courteous service and high tolerance for sarcasm. A shout out to Bob, too.",

We don't have a PF Changs in our town (it's over an hour away) so spotting one here was a huge treat.  Ordered the \"usual\" Changs spicy chicken with white rice. OMG can't get enough. It was perfect with just the right amount of spice. Was disappointed when the trio sauces didn't magically appear like always. Found out you now have to ask for it; too much wasting made them change their policy.   Over all the atmosphere, service and food was good.",

    "text": "Was allows a big fan of PF Chang's. Have my doubts especially regarding the Boca location. Ordered takeout with curbside delivery, had no issues with gentlemen who got my order (friendly and helpful). The quality of the food was not on point. First issue was the regular white rice was undercooked and that would be an understatement(not sure how you can mess up cooking white rice). Cook did not read instructions on order. Both my orders of Pork dumpling/potstickers where not pan fried but steamed, yet the order receipt placed on the order said pan fried. Paid for extra shrimp with shrimp with lobster sauce and having ordered this numerous times got a regular orders worth. Ordered shrimp dumpling and two of the steam dumpling had black specs in the wonton skins, not sure if it was black pepper or something else. The chicken Udon noodles, the noodles tasted tough like they did not boil the noodles before stir frying. I'm typical not one to complain, and rarely post any type of reviews anywhere. After reading the reviews for takeout it seems this a common theme for this location. Will make me hesitant to go back to this location, on a positive note the gentlemen who helped me was professional and nice and the wait time for pickup was not long at all (within 10 minutes of pickup time). The Mongolian beef was cooked perfectly. One of the main reasons I loved PF Changs so much was the quality and Consistency of there food tasting so good.",

To our surprise, when we got back to our hotel, I noticed that they had forgotten plates, napkins, utensils, and all of the dressings that we requested when we made our online order.    Normally, this would not be an issue, but being in a hotel and not realizing this until we got back complicated things tremendously.  That being said, it's not the mistakes you make but how you handle them, and when I called the restaurant to explain our predicament they went above and beyond to make it right.  I wasn't about to drive back to the restaurant, so they offered to refund part of the order via a gift card sent to our house.  As I said, above and beyond.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the original mixup.  The food was excellent.    rgk",

We ordered online and the online app did not have a section to make comments on the order. That is probably one opportunity for improvement. Because of this, we called the restaurant to make a request that we always do when we eat in the restaurant.  We were transferred twice and put on hold a total of 20 minutes. Apparently a manager needed to approve the request to the online order. The manager said that sure he will make sure the request is granted and that the pickup time won't be any longer. We took the food home and  the request was not done. It is fine if you don't want to to do it but don't say that you will and not do it. We weren't requesting anything that isn't done when you do a sit down at the restaurant. If you can't or don't want to do it, the just say you aren't going to do it. Set the proper expectations..that is all I ask. If you weren't going to do it, I would not have been disappointed but now I am extremely disappointed to have to pay as much as we did to not get what was agreed upon.",

Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.  In fact, it was this location on RAMPART that I first held and caressed these ribs, and it's very memorable.  Order \"off the menu\": -- The \"real\" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good. -- The \"Stir-fried Eggplant\" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!  I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.  No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.  ================================== Location specific - Rampart Blvd, Las Vegas ==================================  1.  Smallish location, nice patio.  2.  Parking is tough close-up, but go a few rows over and have no problem.  The shared parking lot is sufficient with the other stores.",

The food was good. Chicken Lettuce Wrap, wonderful.  Combo fried rice and Mongolian Beef, the beef was a little over done for my liking. Over all a good lunch time place for gluten free living :)",

    "text": "This review is for their take-out service. If it comes to food taste, it gets 3 stars. Yet one of our friends found a piece of hair in the buddha's feast. The food we ordered, which was plentiful, was OK otherwise. Let me make it clear that we usually go to the PF Changs in Henderson at the district. The food there is better and the service there is way better. For those that like detail: We ordered food over the phone because online was not working for food orders that did not relate to catering. We also ordered the food 3.5 hours before we requested  it. We ordered orange chicken, sesame chicken, beef broccoli, Buddha's feast steamed, salmon, Mongolian beef, won ton soup, 6 pork dumplings, 6 fried won tons, and lettuce wraps with filling, and both white and brown rice. When asked, I said yes to chopsticks, soy, hot mustard. The answer back was no problem. I get to curbside pickup at 3:56 PM for a 4 PM order (when the order is supposed to be ready). I called to let them know I'm here. A guy comes out and is happy to present me with a bill close to $200 at 4 PM, and then goes on to tell me that the order is not yet ready but it will be very soon. He also proceeds to tell me that they do not have pork and if it is OK to make the dumplings with shrimp. At this time I'm still very friendly and say no problem, even though what he doesn't know is that I'm thinking to myself \"you've had since noon to figure this out and you've had my telephone number all along???\" I'm still friendly and still have a smile my face and nobody knows how disappointed I am because I decide that I would rather  they do a good job and it's not a big deal. With all this time, they must have gotten everything right... The order is ready 40 minutes after it was supposed to be ready on the take-out order. I drive home which is 15 minutes away. I unpack everything and... No chopsticks, no soy sauce, no hot mustard, no fortune cookies, no napkins.  We now have to get into our car and drive to the local grocery store to buy soy sauce and hot sauce as it was not included. In the meantime I decide to call and I want to speak to the manager. I am less than thrilled at this time. In fact, I am absolutely disgusted by how bad the service is at this place. The manager gets on the phone and, quite frankly, I'm not surprised that the service is so bad. She was more irritated by the fact that I was raising my voice in frustration. She tries to make excuses for why the food took so long, even though that is not what I'm upset about, as I'm over that. I was less than impressed by her telling me that they had a big order prior to mine and trying to make excuses for why the order came out late or why they did not get the order right. She finally started becoming more apologetic about it which allowed me to be able to realize that maybe I was speaking to someone that actually cared on the other line, because initially she didn't seem to care at all. Toward the end of the conversation, she kept saying that I needed to be happy and she did not want me unhappy. Anyone knows in a business like this, you offer a certificate like 25 or $50 credit with your next meal. Firstly, you want the customer to come back, as current service is so poor. She kept telling me that she will offer me a discount, but never told me what the discount was. The other thing that really frustrated me was that the manager kept saying 'make sure the food is good as that's what is most important'... Forget the bad service we just gave you as that's not as important... That is the impression that I got from the conversation. The food was just OK. It was nowhere near the quality of food I get at the Henderson location and we were left disappointed. I will not be coming back to this location. It was absolutely awful. I would rather drive to Henderson those extra few minutes to get better service and better food quality. After such a negative experience, not only did I find that the manager wasn't all that helpful to begin with, but because I was not impressed with my phone call with her, I chose not to even call her back to let her know that the quality of the food was just average and completely below average when we found hair in one of the meals. We will not ever be going back here. Not recommended at all!",

Kristopher greeted me in the take out section with a great big smile and offered assistance right away. I had promotional gift cards and handed them to Kristopher, he cheerfully checked the balance, and told me how much I had available. Kristopher then smiled and politely said he would go get J.P. to take my order. J.P. was very friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, and offered great suggestions (food was delicious). He let me know how long my take out order would take and that's exactly how long it took. All my food was sealed tightly in the containers, and the utensils and sauces were stacked nicely on top. J.P. thanked me for visiting and told me to come by again. The restaurant was close to closing and I'm sure everyone was tired but I still got excellent treatment from Kristopher and J.P. and I never felt rushed.  Kristopher and J.P. are wonderful assets to P.F. Chang's and went above and beyond to make sure all my needs were met and they and the restaurant come highly recommended to family and friends!",

For $17.50 I got a bowl of rice that maybe costs a dollar and approximately 10 pieces of dry, chewy, fatty, tasteless flank steak. This dish is suppose to be spicy with sauce but it was not. It did have a slightly sweet taste but had no sauce what so ever just dry chewy meat, a couple of green onions and rice. The dinner came with nothing else. I am still hungry and angry too. I went at approx 5:00 pm on a Wednesday and service was only OK. Never again.. I am done with P.F. Chang's.",

My boyfriend wasn't feeling good and decided not to eat and just ordered a cocktail. I just ordered for my daughter . After that she never returned.

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised it was not a busier time for lunch on a sunday (yesterday). But maybe sunday's chill time, because some people have church, maybe more people go out for breakfast vs. lunch, maybe there are a lot of other dining choices on the area (Summerlin's growing). Well, it was nice, to get seated right away, so no complaints here. (Maybe I'm comparing it to the touristy one on Paradise and Flamingo, which was always jam-packed, in previous visits over the years.)   We (my husband, our son, me, my Mother-In-Law and her husband) had a bunch of different things, family style. The food: Chang's Lettuce Wraps (a classic PF Chang's favorite; always yummy!), Hokkien Street Noodles- combo (new recipe, curry), Sesame Chicken (broccoli and peppers- crisp), Mongolian Beef (tender flank steak with garlic, green onion; one of their best dishes, not spicy), Chicken Fried Rice (egg, carrots, bean sprouts, green onion; cooked perfectly), and, later, Signature Lo Mein (egg noddle, mushrooms, asian vegetables; excellent taste!). Everything was delicious, except the new recipe Hokkien Street Noodles (thin rice noodles, curry sauce, chicken, shrimp, egg, onion, julienned vegetables)---this was terrible. So we sent it back. I am not a fan of curry unless it is Thai curry. I don't even like the smell of the other curry, either. Sorry, just being honest.     The menu is pretty varied, not just Chinese, but explore flavors of Asia; there is something for everyone- Chinese (dim sum), Vietnamese (lava cake), Japanese (sushi). The following menu types are: street fare, dim sum, salads, sushi, market sides, soups, main entrees: chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian, noodles & rice. There are also gluten-free selections, kids menu (desserts too), beverage, & daily squeeze, and desserts. Weekday Lunch pairings (just to name a few, ahi poke bowl, chang's lettuce wraps, with soup, salad, or spring rolls; $10.95- $12.50) and wok classics (sesame chicken, miso glazed salmon, beef with broccoli, just to name a few) are for monday through friday, until 4 pm (pricing ranges from $9.50 to $12.50). Also does takeout, BTW. I got a menu for when we get the hankering.   The food philosophy is Farm to Wok. The food is cooked fresh (made to order). I also like the fact that all the meat (including seafood) sources are USA-based, as well, as the white rice and brown rice (in light of \"plastic rice\", I'm sure you can appreciate this too).     The service was excellent, from the hostess (very nice), to our server (she was also patient, when we were all looking at the menu, trying to figure out what we all wanted), to the exit (we were thanked for coming in and received goodbye greetings). Our server was apologetic when we didn't like the Hokkien Street Noodles (all it took was one bite for me to agree that it was not good), and she was very attentive- filling up our waters without us asking and she checked on us several times to see how we were doing. She packed up all the leftovers for us too, complete with a bag.     The ambiance was very nice. It's elegant. There are a couple statues in the lobby, where there is also seating should there be a wait. Plush booth seating (near the window) and tables/ chairs. Not your typical Asian eatery. I'm not saying that all the restaurants in China Town are dumps, I'm just saying, that this one's slightly elevated than the typical norm. Sometimes, you visit small restaurants, local ones near your home, and sometimes, you also want to enjoy the atmosphere, too. Isn't variety the spice of life?     Join the club, get points to get started, earn freebies. Just give your server your telephone number. Not sure if there is an expiration date to collecting the points (some clubs have one).",

It was some of the best fried rice I've ever had.   My main course was the Crispy Honey Chicken and boooooy did that have me buzz'n like a bumble bee! It's the bees-knees!

Until last night. My dad and his gf came to town and wanted to come here. It's also my dad's favorite Chinese restaurant. So I called and asked the girl how long the wait was for 6, she told me 25 minutes. Thinking oh that's good for Friday, I asked her if there's a call ahead list, she said yes. Then she said to hold on and she wants to check to be sure she can put me on call ahead. Ok fair enough, so I wait and she gets back on the phone and her exact words \" we can't accommodate a party of 6 tonight\" uhm excuse me? I asked her exactly what she meant, she said they can't take a party of 6 tonight. So I asked her if I would've come in with my family and never would have called, they would of shooed us away? She said well we can't accommodate you tonight. Still super vague I said ok then we will just come in, and she said we can't and the wait will be 45 minutes cause we have too many other parties of 6. Ok so why not tell me that the first time? Who tells someone they can't accommodate them? Super rude, super unprofessional, and we took ourselves else where. I will never come back here again. They need to work on how the front of the house runs stuff, cause that is only hurting their business.",

He wasn't giving eye contact when I was talking to him, he was smirking and making comments under his breath. The food runners were giving me very dirty looks. The people that you may dislike or no longer have in your life may just come into the place that you work. Not to \"stalk\" you but because they like the food and the atmosphere. I got treated very poorly by the coworkers at this establishment. When you have personal business with someone you should leave it at home and not bring it into your work place you shouldn't treat a customer with disrespect. I won't point fingers and say who these food runners are.   I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu the sea bass and with that I was even unsatisfied. It just had no flavor it was boring, and it made no sense at all to put it on a bed of uncooked spinach. I probably won't come back to this P.F. Chang's.",

It's literally been ages since I've been here, and the menu seems to have changed drastically from what I remember. It was happy hour at the time so we ordered a few items off their happy hour menu as well including their signature chicken lettuce wraps, Hunan dragon wings, and spicy tuna roll. I didn't have huge expectations from this place, because well, it's Americanized Chinese food, an upgraded version of Panda Express. The spicy tuna roll was not very good (rice was hard), lettuce wraps were what I remembered them to be, but the wings were pretty flavorful. I also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the crispy honey shrimp (which was recommended by our waitress), but other than that, all the food was saltier than the Dead Sea. Expect your blood pressure to rise sharply after eating here.   Despite the mediocre food, the service was some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. I wish I got our waitress' name (reddish-brown hair), because she at least deserves a shoutout here. She was very friendly and accommodating, and our drinks were never empty. It got fairly busy throughout the night as well, but she consistently checked in on us. Thank you for making our dining experience much more enjoyable.   I'm not sure if I'll be back here anytime soon unless I have a gift card that I need to use, but please give the waitress a raise because she was the star of the night.",

Be careful of some of the dipping sauces if you can't tolerate hot foods. The one that tastes like horseradish will bring tears to you eyes! The kung pao chicken is tasty, and not too hot to eat. My favorite bite was the garlic noodles- smooth and garlicky, a must have!",

    "text": "All P.F. Changs are pretty much the same: good food, but slow and/or retarded service.  First, the food. I honestly didn't like the food when I tried it years ago for the first time. Then I discovered that at this restaurant, you really have to order different dishes on every visit to break down what you like and don't like. My favorites are the Crispy Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. Shockingly, I don't eat green beans, but I do like the Crispy Green Beans appetizer. Everything is better when fried! Also, brown rice is an option without an extra charge, yay!  As I mentioned, service is slow. If you plan to dine in, be prepared to stay for like an hour and a half. If you need to get in and out quick, you MIGHT have better luck with take out/curbside pickup. Remember, I said MIGHT. This location can get pretty crowded for dinner on a weekday. We came here during the middle of the week. The parking lot was packed and although there were many people waiting to get a table, we were seated within a few minutes.  What really annoyed me was my last visit. I called in my order for curbside pickup. 30 minutes later, I parked in one of the curbside parking stalls. I waited about 5 minutes before an employee ran to my car. She greeted me, repeated my order back to me, I confirmed it, and gave her my debit card. A few minutes later, I got my food and started to drive back home. As I was at a red light, I peeked in the brown paper bag and noticed that they forgot to give me my 2 boxes of white rice. Grrr! Pulled a U-Turn and drove back. Luckily, I wasn't too far away at the time. When I got there, I didn't see any employees in the curbside area, so I called the restaurant. Hey, they are the ones that forgot my rice, so I wasn't going to get out of my car! The first person I talked to transferred me to the hostess. The hostess then transferred me to take out. Then take out transferred me to curbside. WTF? I told the last guy on the phone that I was missing my 2 boxes of white rice, I drove back and was parked in a curbside stall and asked if someone could run it to my car. He said \"Let me see what my manager can do for you\" and put me on hold. A few minutes later, dial tone. Really?? Right when that happened, the curbside employee who helped me earlier came to my window and said \"Was something wrong, ma'am?\" I told her I was missing my rice, she apologized, and  finally gave it to me.   Lesson learned. Always check your bag before you leave. But still. This isn't McDonalds for crying out loud! Its their job to make sure all the orders are correct! I did call back later that night to speak with a manager about how unorganized they were and how much of my time they wasted because they couldn't do something simple as double checking the orders. She apologized and did send me a $10 gift card in the mail, which was nice of her. I do like the food here so I will be back. Hopefully things will run more smoothly the next time around.",

That was SUPER mindful of him to do. We didn't like a certain tea, he whisked it away and was back out with a different beverage in about 2 minutes (if that!) This was my first time here but with this service and food quality, it won't be my last. THANK YOU for the great experience!",

    "text": "I usually run the other way when it comes to chain restaurants, but we've had a $50 gift card for P.F. Chang's that was given to us about six months ago and finally decided to bite the bullet.  I've been to the one on the Strip twice, but that was a long time ago, my only memory being grease, and more grease.  So I wasn't particularly looking forward to dinner tonight.  But 50 bucks is 50 bucks, so...  The economy must have gotten to PFC:  Saturday night and no wait for a table at 9:00 pm.  I settled on a glass of white zin (yeah, I know, Kool-Aid), and hubby ordered a Newcastle on draft.  I see-sawed between ordering a la carte, since the Spiced Lamb sounded interesting, and the 39.99 Four-Course dinner, until the waitress said that the Sesame Chicken on the dinner was really, really good.  So we went for it.  I was totally surprised.  The Hot & Sour Soup, while not overwhelmingly spicy, was delicious, not overly glutinous, and had a generous helping of both pork and tofu.    The lettuce wraps were very good, and we were offered a second helping of lettuce, since the first batch didn't make a dent in the large portion of chicken and crispy rice noodles.    By that time we were pretty full, so dinner tomorrow night will be our leftovers:  that excellent Sesame Chicken, and the Kung Pao Shrimp, which was terrific, but would have been even better if I ever could remember to have the kitchen NOT add any additional salt.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't like shrimp!!  Best of all was the absence of the pools of grease that I remember from the Strip location.  There was even a lot less oil than we get at our usual New York Chinese Restaurant go-to, and the ambience is a lot nicer.  The Prix Fixe includes two desserts, and there are eight mini desserts to choose from, all served in shooter glasses.  I had the Lemon Tres Leche [sic], which didn't taste at all like the usual Tres Leches dessert, but was astoundingly good, so much so that the little shooter seemed much more dessert than I should be eating.  Hubby had the Apple Pie, and liked it a lot.  But mine was better!!  Our server, Nancy, was outstanding - everything a server should be:  friendly, helpful, patient, efficient, and accommodating.    All in all, we had a terrific meal in an attractive place, and would have enjoyed it just as much if we actually had to pay for it!",

    "text": "As far as chain restaurants go, Chang's is pretty good. Of course, that's not saying a whole lot.  The one item on the menu really worthy of praise is the Oolong marinated Sea Bass. When prepared properly it's delicious, but even this dish can be hit or miss. The first few times I tried it the fish was perfectly seared, crispy on the outside and buttery soft in the center. The last time I ordered the Sea Bass, it tasted so different... almost like it was steamed instead of seared. Not crisp, just sort of mushy.   The rest of the menu items I have tried have just been alright, not bad but not great. Lettuce wraps were a bit bland, spare ribs were rubbery, egg rolls were mediocre.  The servers mixing up their own style of sauce can be fun, the new mini desserts are a nice touch, there's a full bar. The Vietnamese crab salad is good, I think it is a seasonal irem.  Overall there are just so many better, authentic options in Vegas.  My advice, get out and explore.",

A group of 7 went in for lunch and the place was not busy (probably because it was St. Patty's day and most irish places were full during lunchtime).  As soon as we got to the hostess stand, who never smiled, she seemed annoyed that a larger group was asking for a table of 7.  She scoffed about having to put two tables together.  Then, when we left, she did not say \"bye\" or \"thank you.\"  Still had the same scowl on her face.  The service was ok in between the hostess's awful attitude.  And, the place does have some good lunch prices.  But, my entire group was turned off from the horrible hospitality, or lack thereof.

We stopped by for a quick late lunch at around 4 pm on Wednesday afternoon. As we were walking towards the host stand, one of the two hostesses (she looked middle aged, dark hair), stared at us with her mouth hanging open and then said, \"can I help you.\" Asked for a table for two. \"Ummmmm, are you guys here for happy hour or no\" I say no, just lunch. She looked down for the rest of the conversation and said, \"K, this table here okay\" And points to the first booth closest to the host stand. We said sure, it was a nice table. \"K. Sit and I'll bring your menus in a sec\". We sat and a minute later, she brings our menus while looking at the bar area the whole time and walked away without saying a word. No \"enjoy your meal\", no \"enjoy\", nothing. Throughout our meal, she walked across our table talking loudly to the other employees, and once even yelling across the room to say something to a server right in front of our table. I didn't see a single smile or politeness from her to us or any other guests.   I don't write reviews about the host stand because that doesn't make or break an experience for me, but she was so unprofessional and rude that I'm sorry, I was disgusted.   Two stars for the always satisfying, good food and for Luis, our very friendly and professional server.",

I'm in the food industry and it's a tough job and you have to have the right outlook at it and micheal had that and more tonight so we thank you so very much!!",

Our server was more than a little slow to get to the table (the place was almost empty). Then we ordered the Mongolian Beef. What we received was overly chewy, had no sauce, and tasted old. We spoke with the manager and he had a new plate made fresh (which was much, much better) and he even comped the gf dessert for us. We had the berry ginger shortcake. That was delicious! I could eat that every day. Thank you for your dedication to customer service. We appreciate it!",

Idvsat the worst one for service is not the planet Hollywood location, however it's the stand alone flamingo/paradise location. Poor service  And lots of fast paced activity with loud noises, not a relaxing PF Changs, the mangers at charleston location are the best!!",

We came for dinner on a Sunday and called around 6:30pm to see if it was still happy hour. We were told that happy hour was until 7 but when we got there they told us there is no happy hour on sundays. The manager came out and was very apologetic so we stayed and order coconut sours while we waited for the rest of our dinner party. I love the coconut lemon sour, it's made with coconut water and I ask them to leave out the simple syrup bc I don't like it sweet. After we got seated for dinner the service was a little slow but the food is good! The spicy chicken is good but the sauce is very rich and sweet (as our most items). The chicken lettuce wraps are a more lighter refreshing item.  Prices are typical for this type of sit down full service restaurant. About $15 a plate. We always end up ordering way too much food here so my sister got to take home so many leftovers!",

When she can back with small boxes we were confused. She then proceeded to grab all the plates and start to dump them into boxes. While she was moving boxes around, she put 3 dishes in one. My broccoli and beef is now under my sister's mongolian beef, which is now under everyone's rice. Just guessing, but that's one way to ruin everyone's food. Yet the experience started from when I walked in. The host wish me happy birthday, great. The waitress on the other hand did not offer anything to drink besides basics. I just turned 21. Apparently I'm still not allowed to order alcohol, but my TWIN sister can, as she was the only one offered that menu.",

This review is based on a particular server at the Rampart location where I met a friend for lunch today.  A server other than my waitress brought out the food with white rice on the plate.  I told him I ordered brown rice.  He said that's not how he received the order.  He didn't want to correct the problem.  I then asked him if he could take it back and give me brown rice.  He said he could but he didn't want to get his germs in my food.  Excuse me?!  Was he threatening to spit in my food, or what?  Then he reluctantly agreed to bring me some brown rice and as he sauntered off like he was strolling in the park, he started twirling his tray in the air!! I have never, in my life, encountered a server so intent on offending a customer.  The waitress (Nano) brought the brown rice and swapped it for the white on my plate.  Usually the service is good, but this guy was unbelievable!  I won't be going back to this location and plan to talk to the GM at the GVR location about it.  This shouldn't happen in ANY restaurant!",

Walked in on a beautiful, sunny spring-like 68-degree day last week, excited because they had an outdoor patio! Place was wasn't busy at all. Asked the hostess (who was extremely polite) if we could sit outside for lunch. She went to check, came back and said \"Sorry, my manager said we don't have the patio open.\" Not open? It's an unlocked door, which we just walked through to get in, and there's an outdoor table only about 10 feet from the indoor tables. On a slow day, they're not willing to open a door to serve customers with cash in hand? Not good business.  We were really hungry and the hostess was nice, so we didn't make a stink and decided to stay. She showed us to a table inside. We sat there for 20 minutes, and no one ever came to the table or addressed us, despite wait staff walking right by us numerous times. We walked out and walked over to Flower Child (which was great!). Obviously, we won't go back to this P.F. Chang's.  When you have a large corporate chain, you're bound to get a few locations with poor management. I'd guess this is one of them. (Hot tip - on a slow day, when people come to your business hungry with cash in hand, let them sit where they want).",

Unfortunately it didn't.   Our drinks took 15 minutes to come out, & our food came out alarmingly quick. Drinks were good but the food was less than stellar. Mind you there were 3 of us & only 1 ordered a mixed drink. This should've been a quick order for any bartender.   We ordered soups & mine was very watery. I ordered the hot & sour soup which came out slightly sour with very little taste. I can't speak for the egg drop soup my friends ordered.   Our appetizer of the cauliflower tempura came out as mostly breading. Taste was okay, but the texture was super soft like it wasn't fried enough.  For entrees we ordered the crispy honey shrimp & sweet and sour chicken. There was nothing crispy about our shrimp & the chicken was really bland.   The service wasn't bad! Our waitress (who's name escapes me) was very on top of things & really wanted to make sure we were happy. I can appreciate that as it seemed she knew drinks took forever & food was meh.",

Not only did we get seated quickly (it's a hopin' spot!) but the entire experience was just fantastic. A small part of our team came out to celebrate the success of our live fly demos last week. I started off with a tenaya creek pail ale - ice cold. We had the Edamame and Crispy Green Beans - perfect. I had one of my faves - Kung Pao Dragon Roll and brown rice. Fresh, spicy and oh so yummy.   I also sampled the dumplings too. All great. Everyone at the table had something different. Of course my test of a great meal is there's no talking. Yup 'nuther good one!    One of my favorite things here was the incredible friendliness of the staff from front desk to bar to table. Although I cannot remember our waiters name, that doesn't mean he wasn't awesome. We've wanted for nothing!  Great conversation complete knowledge of the menu and beverage options too!  Also a nice touch and a real honor was the way our table was treated when they discovered half of our group were military veterans. So many staff folks came by to say thanks.   We never talk about it tho we're all proud to serve however we can, it made the evening even better than it already was!  Thanks to all.   Worth the drive from the strip. You're up closer to the mountains and it's beautiful.",

    "text": "Another outing to this P.F. Chang's yielded a pleasant dinner with friends.  This time I didn't order as many preliminaries as I usually do.  Yet what I did order was very good as ever, except the Wonton Soup included noticeably unseasoned chicken.  My order of wok-fired Filet Mignon was medium rare as requested, even though our server informed me in advance of the difficulty in nailing this temperature exactly while quick-frying in a wok.  Shrimp-Fried Rice was studded with ample succulent medium-sized shrimps.  And wok-tossed Brussels Sprouts provided a welcome extra touch.    Diane enjoyed an order of Walnut Shrimp, and our friends were pleased with Harvest Curry and Honey Chicken  A heavy metallic pot of Sweet Ginger Hot Tea washed everything down nicely for me, while Diane preferred a pot of Citrus Spice Tea for this purpose.    Our reservation was honored upon arrival.  Booth seating was comfortable amid Asian decor, and service was very attentive.",

I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce. My husband had the surf and turf and really liked his. He also had a cup of wonton soup which was just basic as well. The reason for star deductions aside from mediocre food, was the lighting. The angle I was seated at had an extremely bright and piercing light coming down from the ceiling. My husband said I looked like I was being interrogated throughout our whole dinner. I couldn't even look around the room without being blinded. Not sure I have reason to return here honestly.",

The plating and presentation was sloppy, like they just threw it on the plates. Our spring rolls came out and I couldn't believe they would send it out so Un-presented. The Kung pao chicken was bland and not spicy which it should be, also so many peanuts in it you could make peanut butter! The orange chicken didn't have the slightest hint of any orange in it...and lacked sauce. No one at our table really enjoyed their food. Will not come back to a P.F. Chang's again. Been there done that. Your basically paying for the experience of a supposed nice restaurant but it will disappoint if you know anything about food! Everyone at our table agreed mall Chinese food and Panda Express trump this place. And that is a sad thing.",

She is the one who ordered for all of us knowing the menu and what she likes the best.  Beside the classic brown rice, white rice and fried rice she ordered crispy honey chicken (she said she usually order the same but with shrimps and it's better), beef with some greens and lettuce wraps. She's the one who enjoyed it most. But honestly me and another couple who were here for the first time too didn't really like anything and not really dislike it was just average.  I was surprised to have mushrooms and brocolis in the fried rice that we ordered plain. Those were not on the list of the ingredients and I'm allergic to mushrooms so not too happy about that.  The place was clean, not very busy, and our server was nice.  With that said I don't think I'll go back because even if it's cheap it's not very good so not worth it !",

The service was good, but the food is what brought their star rating down.  I ordered the Honey Chicken with White Rice.  First, the Honey chicken was missing the honey and the rice was hard.  Normally, I love the Honey Chicken and take my left over homes and will occasionally pick at it during the remainder of the evening.  However, I took my food home and had to re-cook the food to make it taste worthy.  This was defiantly not what I am used to when coming to PF Chang's.",

Specifically we had the honey shrimp-too sweet and shrimp not fresh, surf & turf, Kung Pow chicken-very bland and oily, and other items.

Walked in and got a strange vibe. Barely friendly, very much to the point. \"Have you picked the entrees you want?\"  Our server had lots of facial hair and we would watch him touch his beard and put chapstick on in the back, but never saw him wash his hands. That grossed us out.  The food wasn't bad, we both ended up full but it's definitely not authentic chinese. I remember coming here after a trip to China and having been disappointed I never came back. Either way it filled us up but it wasn't anything special.  I feel like this place tries so hard to pass off as elegant and what not, but I just wasn't getting that from this experience. Hardly friendly people, without good sanitation practices, with over priced entrees that you could somewhere else with larger portions for a cheaper price.    Safe to say my boyfriend and I left disappointed and agreed that we wouldn't ever come back. I don't get why other people would get so excited about coming here. Nothing special.",

After the server brought part of it out, she reneged on the deal and expected us to pay for the items that were brought out. When I can cancelled the order she then stole my points off my card as if I received the free meal. This is the short version of what happened but the basics. I believe she just didn't want my kind to get the free meals and it was apparent by her choice of words and temperament. Her tone was also loud enough to try to embarrass us in front of the other diners to make it seem as though it's just typical of us. Her skills are limited to a failing fast food chain.",

It was a special occasion for my bf an I an wanted a nice romantic dinner at home. We called an ordered 3 appetizers an 3 main course meals. When we got the food home I couldn't believe how awful it was a the portions were barely enough. The crab won tons were burnt an the shrimp pan fried dumplings the northern style ribs were ok but not as good as when we eat in. The entree portion of Mongolian beef, honey crispy chicken were so little we could hardly share. The only entree that was a little better was the ginger chicken. It was like they had given food for maybe 1 person. It was very disappointing. I will never get take home again. Going in an eating is definitely better. Although it should be good either way",

The interior is like every other P.F. Chang's and the food also is.... same.  That in itself would probably rank itself in a 4 star category if you're not going down to Chinatown for the real thang.  However, the one star deduction came from the terrible misplacement of their Curb-side service.  First, curb-side usually designates that someone will probably come out to take your order or what not.   Instead, this location decided to place the signage out behind their dumpster area.  And there's no video camera or anything so no one comes out to meet you or bring your food.  You still have to head over to the front entrance and get your food from the bar area.  Second, they blocked off the sidewalk with their outdoor patio gate.  So you'll walk the long way around to get to-go food.  It's not only an afterthought for curb-side service, it's a terrible location and there's not a dedicated area for it.  If you're going to do it, do it right.  I'd probably take pointers from Darden's (Outback/Carrabba's) who's had a pickup window/door for a while and they even re-implemented their areas in older venues.  I would probably suggest that they re-do this with the parking that's facing the entrance to make this a more viable solution.  Picking up to-go food at the bar is so 1990s.",

After about 5 mins I comment how long it is taking for someone to come. We all agree and I look around and see waiters standing in the back near the kitchen talking. I wait a couple more mins then pull out my phone to time how long it takes for someone to come and acknowledge our table. After 10 mins we decided to get up and go to another establishment.   As we were walking out I went to go and tell the hostess we were leaving and she was no where to be found. I look to the back kitchen, and she is standing over with the waiters talking.   I can't believe we wasted a good 30 mins at this place. To never even be acknowledged. Never come here - from the other reviews. It's a hit or miss if the food is good or not. Better not risk it...",

She asked our preference table or both since my mom is little disable. The waitress came right away to take our drinks orders. It's was busy for a Sunday afternoon like we all took our mom's out LOL Ordered their strawberry limonade. Didn't like it after the first sip, so I changed it for an ice tea (much better) We ordered eggs drop soup and the sweet and sour (cup size). Lettuce wrap with chicken. My mom loved it and the new presentation of it was great. It was a nice portion! I wished they would provide a tea spoon so you can serve the sauces. Singapore black pepper chicken was yummy! The sliced red chili's just brought a little kick to the flavor. Got the Mongolian beef! Meat was tender. Everyone loved it! Our experience today was good. I have to say (don't take it wrong) I loved the more mature hostesses!  I put 4 stars because I never got ice tea or sprite refill, i asked twice. Also my friend wanted chop sticks, same had to ask 3 times :( My mom still had a great time and it what matters :)",

I have been going to Chang's since they gave out plastic \"Warrior\" cards for their rewards program and used to mix their dumpling sauce to your liking at your table (they don't do either anymore).  The interiors are always dark and classy (though this one seemed a bit more brightly-lit than others which kind of took away from the ambiance).  Reservations are accepted here and are easily made online and highly recommended especially on popular nights.   The menu is extensive.  They no longer have their great \"Chang's for two\" meal deal (sad face), but they have a ton of dishes to suit any taste.    The pan fried shrimp dumplings are a great starter choice.  Plump, crispy exterior with plump shrimp inside.  Orange peel beef is not on the menu but is available and is pleasantly crispy beef with mandarin oranges and a lightly sweet glaze. Kung Pao chicken here is also excellent as are the Salt and Pepper Prawns (but they were apparently out of prawns on our most recent visit).  Save room for the banana spring rolls!  These have been around as long as PF Chang's has existed and are excellent.  The pineapple-coconut ice cream that comes with them is worth the order alone!  Service is usually pretty good; this most recent visit the server disappeared for long periods for time.  But, that seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Consistently tasty food is what PF Chang's is all about, and you can always head down Spring Mountain road for \"authentic\" Chinese food another night.",

They gave us a very small wedge of lettuce, small pieces, no way could we make a wrap.  We did not complain as last time we were there, my food was not hot, and the manager took it away, and, rather than heating it in the microwave, she made me a whole new order.  I was starving, and by the time I got my food, my friend was finished eating. This used to be a good place, no longer, it has really gone downhill. We will not return.",

    "text": "I know they are a large chain but it was my first time to ever try them out. I have always been a little reluctant because I have had Pei Wei (a sister restaurant) & have been greatly disappointed with their quality in the past. Also...only 3 stars for PFChangs??? There is not a lot of high quality (or even good) Chinese food in town. This is our go to spot now!! We started with the shareable bowl of the hot and sour soup. It was delicious! The tofu melted In your mouth and the flavors perfect: sour and spicy, but not overly.  Crispy avocado rolls were amazing! My ten year old was trying to eat them all before we could even try one.  Once we convinced him to try it with the citrus sauce, he couldn't stop 'mmmmmmming'   We even loved the crispy rice noodles. I held onto the sauce to pour onto my rice and it made my meal even better.  We family shared the honey chicken and salt and pepper prawns. The chicken was delicious! I have to rave about the prawns! They were so amazing! They were cooked to perfection! I haven't had seafood that fresh and meaty since a trip to the bay of San Fran. Yes! My shrimp compared! They were large and I just did not want to stop eating them! The wasabi sauce took me a bit off guard. I didn't read what the sauce was and took a huge dip. I can't handle wasabi, so my sinuses were on fire.  Still...it had great flavor!  The food was so great I decided to order a Mai Tai! Amazing! Exactly what a beach drink should taste like! We paid for an exclusive all inclusive resort in Mexico and the drinks were nothing like this! I can even compare to a martini I had at YardHouse the night before and the the martini was weak at its best. I have found my get-away Mai Tai & thank P.F. Chang's for one of my TOP places to eat in LV!",

I walked in @8p on a Monday evening and just wanted a quick to go order. I asked the host and she said to go wait at the bar area...I grabbed my own menu and sat there while the bartender chatted w/two gentlemen Never asked if I needed help..then about 3 other staff including the manager walked right by me and I never got any service. Finally I leaned over and asked a waiter if this was the right area for me to order a to go meal. Finally someone came over & took my order. Just got a small cup of soup and chicken w/ white rice meal. Took a bit longer then I'd anticipated and when I got home only a few turns around the corner the chicken and rice weren't even remotely hot. Ugh. I was hoping to have a much better experience. I'm always iso some new permanent \"go to restaurants\" here in the summerlin area but this time it just didn't cut it sad to say. Didn't even snap any photos of my meal bc I was hurrying to eat it bc it was already luke warm.",

We had the spicy edamame (next time we are sticking to the basic edamame), some egg soup, white rice, the mongolian beef and it was all super quick to come out and extremely delicious! As always! The reason behind the 4 stars was due to the fact that it took a really exaggerated time for our server to approach us. At least with all that time we were able to look over the menu and order everything all in one shot. Other than that the place seemed like it was clean and it wasn't to bright on the lights so it makes it a tad bit more laid back and chill. Probably not the best word choice PF Changs is looking for but I arrived around 9 PM and I was extremely tired and hungry and when we walked in it was an absolute relief that it wasn't loud and bright inside or else I think I would have gone through a drive-thru and called it a night.  So overall I loved the food and the cleanliness. I will even be returning to this location to maybe update my review and give them the 5 stars I know they can reach.",

    "text": "P.F. Chang's gained 3 stars from me.... Not because the food bad- it was delicious- it really was! It was more so the way they handled my food allergies... Okay okay, I'm never trying to be the difficult allergy girl BUT! I did give fair warning them ahead of time...so this is how it went.  I called PF Changs and made a reservation for my family to dine in. - ALL Good.  Arrive 10 min earlier than my rez, which was fine and we waited patiently. In the waiting period, I advised the hostess of my peanut and shellfish allergy and she explained that my server would present a special menu for my perusal of all allergy free menu items.- Great Right!?!  Seated and Server is table side. Once again I advise of my allergy. He insists on giving me and the rest of the table a regular menu, then says the Hostess should have provided me the the special menu. I respond and tell him what I was advised upon arrival... and he says he'll grab one for me...  Ordering time. Still no special menu. I place a family style order for the rest of the Fam going back and forth with the server about what I CAN and CAN'T eat. - At this point I am over it and hungry. Server leaves after taking the rest of the table order to return with the Manager and the special menus.   The manager gives her disclaimer about not selling any \"allergens\" to me and lets me review the menu.   A short time passes and food starts to arrive to the table leaving me more starved than before. The server takes my order and by this point I pick a kids meal because I felt rushed looking over the 4 pages of menu items suited for me- but I was hungry and sucked it up.   My food of course came last and without a side (which should have been included) and while everyone else was finishing up. -Once again, I was over it.  In the end- After being charged for the kids meal that I waited all night to order... I left just to go to through a Drive-Thru and finish my dinner somewhere else.   I love PF Changs! And every other time I had been there, the staff have always made my experience a good one when dining with allergies. I even recommend them to others since they have so many allergy friendly options. But this time they just dropped the ball :(",

We had come to Celebrate my daughters birthday after having to leave a hibachi restaurant bc the wait was too long. We were seated in about 7 mins which was great but the service was disappointing we had to ask several times for refills and the waiters didn't get our orders correctly for a party of 5 (3 adults and 2 children) they forgot my sons side, my daughters drink and my side of sauce. I work in customer service and I have a degree in culinary arts so service is very important to us. The portion of my meal was great and yummy I had the kung pao shrimp, my mom was recommended the ginger chicken it was very bland and not work the money, my husband got the shrimp and lobster, not a fan lots of rice And small small portions of meat. Kids meal is 4.00 meal which i guess u get what you pay for and my daughter had the bowl of hot and sour soup which was way too much for a 12 year old wish out waiter took the time to say it was too much of a portion. Those are the detailed things that make customer service and a good waiter stand out to me. Over all it was a meal just wish it was a better experience and everyone could of walked away. Happy but half of the table was not satisfied with their food for an almost 100.00 receipt kinda disappointing",

The only vegetables I saw besides the onion were a few celery pieces. And no I didn't complain because the ladies I was with were new friends and I just didn't feel comfortable saying anything. I would have felt embarrassed so I just ate about half of the dish, enough to stave off my hunger but not a morsel more. And it was too noisy to hear everything the one lady sitting next to me was saying. Oh well, never again.",

I ordered the crispy honey chicken for myself and Mongolian beef for my husband with a side of long life noodles to share. The noodles were stuck together in a clump and the chicken was soggy. My husband's beef was extremely dry and chewy. I'll give them two stars because it was edible, but it sucked. We both agreed that we won't be back.",

I'm not sure if it had been sitting out but I arrived at 3:16p after being quoted a 3:15p pick up time.  I ordered Mongolian  beef with the excitement of putting the white rice  in it to soak up all of the juicy sweet sauce and was bummed to find that the rice was laying in a deserted sea of just beef  and green onions. I can only imagine the rice's disappointment that it would not live up to its full potential of soaking up deliciousness. Instead the rice was pushed to the side like an unwanted one night stand. The shrimp  fried rice tasted like it had seen better times but was forced to hang out in the red light district (heat lamp) before being reheated and deviously pawned off as new. There is no way that was fresh fried rice.   I also ordered Kung Pao Chicken for my husband who can be somewhat of a Changs hater so I don't always trust his opinion but today he was right. Never a fun moment for a wife to admit that her husband is right. I took a bite and it too was dry and devoid of any sauce.   I think today Changs made itself look like Panda, maybe even worse.",

Soggy egg rolls Flavorless and mushy Won Ton Soup Cold filling for chicken wraps, soggy rice noodles Hard steamed rice.  Last time I was there, it was decent, hadn't been there for 2 years and thought I'd try it again. Yuck - complete bummer. Have had 3 misses so it's off our dining radar for good. Definitely go somewhere else - so many great restaurants in Summerlin!",

I had specific instructions for no onions and when I opened my package, It had a sticker on my meal that stated no onions three times, however the meal had huge chunks of white onion throughout. I called the restaurant, waited about 10 minutes for the manager to come to the phone where he continued to belittle me on my allergy and told me that I couldn't eat the dish regardless because it had onion powder in it. Onion powder is not the same as the raw onion. He then said that he would have Grubhub refund me. I received a phone call five minutes later from the manager stating that the to go person stated that there were absolutely no onions in my meal. I have posted a photo on the website showing my meal with the Receipt attached stating no onions. Absolutely horrible service.",

I was really disappointed with fried beef. I have never seen beef like this any bf Chang and none in any Chinese rest. Beef was was in big pieces and was cooked separately and added to dish. It was so hard and unbeatable so we through away. Chicken fried rice was good. I don't believe in their chef is Chinese but whoever is has no clue about Chinese food. I am planning to go there in three weeks with my guest from other state and I have to make sure every one stays away from beef .",

I won't go into details of every little thing...but the service we received is what I expect whenever I go out for a meal. I walked in with very low expectations and left thoroughly pleased.   While I forget his name, our server was very on top of everything & was attentive to our needs. We never had to ask for anything. His tip reflected how appreciative I was of the service he provided.   While I will never step foot in Henderson again, I will be back here. Just not as often as I would like.",

The manager came over and comped some of their meal for them.  The waiter didn't introduce himself as he kept looking over at the disgruntled table.  He asked for our order and left.  The soup and lettuce wraps came out quickly, but we literally waited over an hour from the time we got there until our entrees arrived.  Once they did, some of the chicken seemed raw.  I'm pregnant, so I didn't risk eating it.  It was really stringy, slimy and chewy so I spat it out. The waiter barely spoke with us, was very awkward and inattentive. I wanted to cut him some slack and think maybe he had a rough night, but he barely even squeaked out an apology about our food being late and we were there for over 2 hours from the time we sat down at the table until the time we left. I recognize that people make mistakes, but at least own up to them and try to make it better.  My husband and I don't go out a lot, so when we do we like to make it a good experience.  Unfortunately tonight was NOT a good experience.  I think we will think twice before going back there again. :-S",

The down sides are that there is often a long wait to get seated, over an hour at peak dinner hour, and the price is higher than most Chinese food.  But other people have had poor experiences there.  They do have some dishes that are not that great, and if that was all I had ever ordered there, I would certainly give them a worse rating.  I do not recommend their salads, for example.

    "text": "This used to be my favorite go-to Chinese cuisine restaurant.  However, the last few times I have been there, I have fallen more disappointed than the next.  I think the food is consistent, but extra heavy on the sodium.  Also, menu items seem to stay stagnant without changing here and then.  Finally, it seems as if the expectations for the servers have been lowered.  Do managers still visit the tables?  I think the icing on the cake was our last experience. We were DOUBLE charged on our bill, and when we called it to our server's attention he shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  Yes you heard it...no sorry, no apology, no \"have a good day.\" We were appalled.   (You better believe we will be checking our credit card statement to see if he actually credited our bill.) With that attitude, it almost felt as if we busted him in a scam. Thankfully, we compared the bill with the others who split it with us or else this might not have been caught. I hope management gets it together here and teaches basic customer service skills to their employees. That being said, I will give it another honest try at some point.",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed in this place. They are always so busy, it takes forever to get a table. But what really upset me is the time I called in a to-go order on a Sun night around 7 pm. When I called in the order, they said it would take 25 min.  So when I arrived at the restaurant 25 min later, (btw I waited by the to-go register for at least 5 min without even being acknowledge by any of the staff) I was told that the order just went in and it would take another 40 min. So I just cancelled my order and walked out. If they would've just told me on the phone when I called in order that it would take an hour, I would've been ok with that. I could've waited at home for an hour doing something worthwhile instead of wasting my time waiting at the restaurant. But they lied and said it would only take 25 min. It's too bad their service is horrible because I like their food. I will NOT be going here again.",

Right now they're offering a prix-fixe menu for two for $39.95. Yup, dinner for two for forty bucks, not forty bucks each. The meal comes w/ two orders of soup (we both got the egg drop soup -- wasn't bad), one appetizer (pork potstickers -- tasty), two entrees (cashew chicken -- pretty good; mongolian beef -- crispy and flavorful), and two desserts (carrot cake -- it was ok; chocolate cake -- best thing all night). The desserts are mini desserts (served in shot glasses) not their regular sized ones. All in all, not bad for the price. The service was pretty good also.",

My non gluten free hubby loves the gluten free version more than the regular version. PF Changs uses different plates for gluten free dishes, they are round and have PF Changs China Bistro printed on them, this is to guarantee that gluten free orders are in fact delivered to the right people. I appreciate the extra step big time!  We always get a bowl of egg drop soup to share, my husband orders the Northern Style Ribs (not gf because they are marinated in regular soy sauce although they offer a gluten free version of the soy sauce they don't do the ribs that way), then we get the Singapore Street Noodles and Combo (chicken and pork) gluten free fried rice. Service is always good at this location and for the last 4 years we've almost always had the same server if we go in at dinner time. We always do call ahead for seating, unless you go in at lunch I strongly recommend it.   Food is great, now I'm craving it again... Stupid appetizing review.",

It's a nice broth with won ton dumplings, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. For $7 you get enough for 3 adults! We got lunch specials which come with a soup or salad, we both got salad. I loooove the dressing! I had caramel mango chicken with brown rice and it is spiiiiiicy :) the menu does warn you! It had white meat chicken peices in a spicy sweet sauce with mango, red onion, tomato, and slices of red chili! Hubby had their combo fried rice which is a fall back favorite! Rice, carrots, bean sprouts, beef, chicken, and shrimp cooked to perfection! They aren't cheap with the protein either!! For dessert we had the great wall of chocolate!!! Super moist and decadent perfect for all 3 of us to share. I will be going back here, hopefully soon!!! For 2 adults and my 3 yo the check was $52 and that's with an $8 tip!!",

Our waiter was very attentive and even recommended a good red wine to drink (which was $11) but I can't remember the name of it. Anyways the food was okay for me, I got the street noodles or something like that and to me it reminded me of pad thai (which was more spicy and less sweet) with shrimp. My mom got the moo goo gai pan (sorry if misspelled and butchered) and it literally had no flavor, it was so bland that my mom had to ask for salt (which is very rare for her to ask of that which meant it seriously had no taste). My mom's friend got shrimp fried rice and their version of orange chicken which was not much different that panda express to me, just a bit better in taste.  Overall It wasn't SUPER good or worth the price really (in my case). I mean P.F. Changs is a good place if you want more expensive asian food, but im sure you can find somewhere else that serves good asian food for less.",

If their prices were cheaper I'd give them four stars because I enjoy the ambience, find it a comfortable place to hang out with friends, and believe their entrees and appetizers to be interesting and flavorful.  I liked going during happy hour with a few friends, where we had a lot of fun and never felt rushed. I thought the appetizers were tasty, and my friends liked the drinks from the bar.    I don't  mind paying for quality, but I don't think their offerings are worth the prices they charge, so I won't be coming here often, and most of the time it'll be for happy hour with friends.",

Where else can you go and for 2 people get soup, appetizer, 2 entrees, rice and dessert for $39. That is a 4 course meal.  Am I missing something here? This is a damn steal! If you think that is \"overpriced\" then go to Chili's or Applebees and eat that garbage! PF Changs has amazing Asian cuisine that is superb, full of flavor and well worth the price. We had very fast and courteous service last night as well, and every time I have ever went I have never had any issues with the service.   My fave dishes/apps are Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Orange chicken, Lettuce wraps and Chicken chow mein. I haven't tried everything so I am sure there is more awesomeness to eat there as well. I do not eat fish so can't really speak on that.  If you want to upgrade your dessert for $1.95, Try the Banana spring rolls. Its fried banana with pineapple coconut ice cream with vanilla and caramel sauce and fruit! Amazing! I love PF Changs.

    "text": "It's my second time ever dining at P.F. Chang's, and I must say I've been pretty resistant in the past.  We had a gift card that we had to use up, so we figure we're in the Summerlin area and we may as well grab lunch.  There was easily no wait on a weekend afternoon, although we were told all the outside tables were taken.  They had about 9 offerings of lunch bowls that are served daily until 4 pm that include your entree being served on a bed of rice, and a cup of either Egg Drop or Hot & Sour soup.  They bring to your table a bunch of dipping sauces, about six of them that include soy sauce, hot chili sauce, vinegar, hot yellow mustard, hot chili oil, and one other thing.  My choice:  * Egg Drop Soup \"A classic starter\" - It was piping hot when it arrived and with a bit of heat added to it, it wasn't too bad.  I was starving and drank it all up.  It was a bit darker than what I expected it to be though.  * Buddha's Feast \"Veggies with five-spice tofu served steamed or stir-fried\" - I liked the fact that you can have brown or white rice, which is a nice perk you don't typically find at Chinese restaurants, but then again, this isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  It's a generous portion for one, and I like their choice of veggies.  It had broccoli, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, and tofu all in my dish.  So, it's definitely a hearty dose of the good green veggies.  I definitely needed to add some heat to my dish and eventually added enough chili oil that my rice was swimming in it.  The Husband had:  * Hot & Soup \"Either by the cup or bowl, this will warm your soul\" - I guess it was okay, and he did drink it up.  I don't ever order this, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.  * Sesame Chicken \"Back by popular demand...love the ginger, chili paste and garlic\" - He asked the waiter if they could make it extra spicy, which he said of course too.  Except that when the order arrived, the Husband said it tasted like they didn't put any hot spices in there.  He wasn't particularly fond of the sauce of the dish, but beyond the chicken was onions, broccoli, and bell peppers with black sesame seeds tossed in there.  They were offering 'mini' desserts that arrived in shot classes, which was a sampling for about $2/each.  We went for two kinds:  * S'mores - The Husband thought this was too sweet for him, and it really was crushed graham crackers, a very sweet marshmallow creme, and chocolate sauce.  * Strawberry Cheesecake - The Husband enjoyed this more, and all it really consisted of was crushed graham crackers, strawberry preserves, and white cream.    (They reminded me of something you could easily do at home, but I guess it satisfies your sweet tooth with having to purchase one of their bigger desserts.)  Overall, the food was decent, and the portions were pretty generous for the price.  It'd be different to go for dinner and do family style though.  We noticed mostly everyone had to go boxes with them, although I found it weird how the staff would hold the to go box against their stomach and shovel the food into it.  (Sure, it works, but it looks not so nice.)  Side note: They offer a chef's table that allows you to eat inside the kitchen as you can watch them cook.  Pretty cool!",

    "text": "I love PF Changs. Usually a very solid choice. Not this time...  I took my 15 year old nephew here for his birthday and it was his first time eating at PFC. We had been shopping and running around all day so we were starving.  He asked me too order for him cause he didn't know what to get.   So I got the chicken lettuce wraps, fried rice, orange chicken, edamame, and a sushi roll.   They brought the lettuce wraps out with the Fried rice and orange chicken. My nephew and I both made a wrap and devoured it. My last bite of the wrap I noticed something strange as I'm chewing; In my head im thinking is this a mushroom or maybe tofu and then start to realize something isn't right!?!? I spit it out on my side plate and it was a huge chunk of RAW CHICKEN! I started digging through the dish and almost the entire dish was raw. I almost puked.   I called the waitress over to the table and brought it to her attention. Mind you the restaurant was full and I'm trying my hardest to not make a scene but guests around me can hear the waitress and I talking about it and they proceed to start digging through their dishes.  The waitress took the plate away and grabbed the manager. I do want to say that the waitress was extremely nice and very helpful however embarrassed.  The manager comes over to my table and expresses her disappointment and said she will fix it immediately. Keep in mind the rest of my food came out at the same exact time as the lettuce wraps and during this whole ordeal it's sitting there getting cold.   I could keep going on and on about my experience but long story short they did nothing but take off the lettuce wraps off of the bill. The least they could have done was comp the measly $50 bill.   Very Very Disappointed",

Maybe they thought it was necessary to overbook because all of the people that they are turning away couldn't fill a few unreserved tables? No it's just bad management. I just went up to the hostess stand wad she said your next after 1 other. Then they seated two other groups of our size (2).

Shame on the management for not calling another server in. They had plenty of time, as we waited 30 minutes just to receive our appetizer. Once the food FINALLY arrived, it was decent, but nothing to write home about. The only saving grace for this experience was our server, Kyle.

Sitting in take out my car battery died. Crapola, just my luck. No jumper cables. So I called a near by yelp friend.. Shout out to Liz R! Anyway, her cables were too short and of course to remedy that problem we would have to ask a pf change customer to stop eating and move their car, no thanks, that's rude and I would never interrupt their meal for my convince. The take out lady was nice enough to bring my daughter a drink, bring me her jumper cables from her car and help us start it. For some reason it still wasn't working, just clicking. She asked her manager to come out and have a look. He did, or well I thought it was the manager, he never gave us his name. Long story short he wiggled stuff around, gassed it a bit. And boom it worked. By the time I got home my food was luckily still warm,   Thumbs up to pf changs for the amazing help, I would have been stuck without you because AAA wait time was one hour and my husband was 40 minutes away.",

    "text": "We came here mostly because my cousin Leslie gave us a $50 Chang's gift card as our wedding present. I've always appreciated that this is one of the healthier restaurant chains.  There's a heavy emphasis on fresh veggies, but as long as it includes their NOTORIOUSLY addictive crispy green beans, I don't mind one bit.  So it's kind of strange that we actually didn't have the green beans on this trip. Probably because for me, at least, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps took precedence over everything. It's always been my go-to here to help me with my 'crunchy' fix.   We also decided to chow down with Cecelia's Pork Dumplings, the Chicken AND the Pork Egg Rolls.  There were multiple orders of everything - yes, we (make that I) went a little nuts, but it wasn't a bad thing.  Paired with drinks, our \"app dinner\" was so satisfying, that we really didn't need dessert...I know that sounds like we had a choice, but we were so stuffed that we didn't.  The service was excellent as always. Not really a mystery why we hadn't been back in so long, since there are so many great places to eat in the Valley now, so that you never have to go to the Strip if you don't want to.  I'll need to leave a reminder for myself sometime, to come back to Chang's every few weeks, so I won't need the excuse of a gift card...",

    "text": "What a huge disappointment this local Las Vegas Boca Park branch of PF Chang has turned out to be! PF Chang used to be one of my favorites. Even though it was always a bit more pricey than most other Asian cuisine-based restaurants, it usually seemed well worth the extra cost. This is no longer even remotely the case.  This evening I ordered three entrees and a soup for takeout: the Mongolian beef, a chicken pad Thai, PF Chang's spicy chicken signature dish, and a large order of egg drop soup. The soup was fine.  The spicy \"signature\" chicken dish that was recommended by the staff tasted exactly like sweet and sour chicken and was over-cooked and mediocre at best.  However the colossal, unforgivable failures of the evening were both the Mongolian beef and the chicken pad Thai. The Mongolian beef was, in a word, inedible: it was tough, overcooked, way too chewy to even attempt to swallow, and beyond dry. There was absolutely no liquid, sauce or any moisture to be found in this dish. There were about eight to ten small pieces of steak in the container, which, when pro-rated at the ridiculous price of $18.50, was a serious ripoff. It was unceremoniously garnished with a few wilted green onion stalks.  The chicken pad Thai was completely inedible as well. The rice noodles were severely undercooked and hard. Preparing rice noodles is not exactly rocket science, and yet, somehow this restaurant managed to mess them up. There was no sauce in the dish or any pad Thai sauce coating the noodles at all, making it pitifully dry and bland, had anyone been motivated to actually chew and swallow it.  No one was able to eat this dinner, except for the soup.  The pad Thai, along with the Mongolian beef, will be brought back to the restaurant in the morning. This meal cost an astounding $63.76, and was a distasteful mistake I will not be making ever again. Shame on you, PF Chang. I won't be back.",

Mind you she only had 2 tables. Took 20 minutes for our food which isn't bad but when she brought it to the table she didn't say one word. Never asked how it was and 10 minutes later we were still looking for her to get hot sauce. Never got refills on our drinks. Took about 10 minutes to get our check and then we had to ask another server to run the card. First time there and probably won't be back.",

When we arrived we were sat in the booth near the host station so we got to listen to their banter and we felt like we were on display as people waiting for their tables have no choice but to stare at you lol   The menu has all the usual favorites but when the food arrived it was lacking flavor. I has had better egg rolls from Panda Express. Very disappointing  We ordered orange chicken, garlic noodles, egg rolls and lettuce wraps. The one star is for the lettuce wraps because those were delicious. The other dishes fell flat on flavor and temperature. The food was like warm. The rice was super sticky as well.   Our waitress was more interested in chatting to the booth next to ours (the men were either employees or friends of another staff member because they all seemed to know them). We waited a long time to get beverage refills and our check at the end.   Based on flavor, service, experience, and price I probably won't return or recommend returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "Received a gift card to PF-Chang and thought this would be a good excuse to try this 'China bistro'. We only ate a little bit at the restaurant because we didn't like any of our dishes and packed most of it for home...got my surprise when I ate my fried rice the next day.  First of all-If people think that going here would call itself as 'having Chinese food'. It could be farther fetched. It is Chinese-fusion at best...but that isn't even good.  Food dishes were ok. Not really any Asian flare, besides using some Asian vegetables. we had the lemon chicken, crab wontons, beef and broccoli and beef fried rice. All were just blah- the lower end Chinese take-out places are tastier than this. To top if off my fried rice had a quarter size egg shell in it...if it was like a 1/4inch piece...ok shit. An happen. But that thing was a size of a quarter...can't fish that out???? How did you not notice it fell in it.  Only 1 star for ambience. Interior is nice, semi circular bar is ok. But overall I will not go back here no recommend this place. I can get better Chinese food at China-a-go-go....and that means a lot. For the same  value at PF Chang I could get like twice the items and at least have more flavorful food. If you want to eat Chinese, go to Chinatown. Otherwise-don't waste your time dressing up and have some blah fusion food.",

    "text": "I come there about once a month.  However, dining inside is a 50/50 chance you're going to be frozen out.  They have the a/c going like the fridge is full and we need to keep some beef from spoiling that is outside of the freezer.  This is not a one-time experience but almost every time (during summer months that is).  The food - Well, they rotate a few things in and out on the menu but usually they are introducing things that are a complimentary item to the taste buds.  My wife gets garlic snap peas which I don't believe are currently on the menu as one of the available items, but they make it for her anyway.  I always enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps (and I think this is the place that really made them popular) and like their more recent additions of the sushi rolls as well.  In addition, the Kung Pao Chicken is delightful.  I always try to enjoy the egg drop soup but they are not consistent with the viscosity of the soup and sometimes it gets more like pudding than soup and when it gets like that, you can put green dye in it and it's the same as the kids toy \"slime\".  However, that's not all the time and for the most part - I like the food.  The Staff - Most of the time, they are great and no complaints there.  To Sum up - I like the food and the staff.  However, the place is busy at times and to get a seat where you freeze your butt off after waiting a while, that sucks (and no one does anything if you mention it).  If their sister company (Pei Wei) was closer to the house, I'd bypass going inside to dine altogether and just get the food there or to go as it's just as tasty in my opinion but obviously has a more limited menu selection.",

    "text": "Last Friday my family & I went to this PF Changs for the first time for my mother in laws birthday.  Being newly vegan, my husband & I are limited on our options.  We were seated in about 1/2 the time we were told which was super and when I explained my food restrictions the waitress was very sweet and went back to grab a special list of food items.  Instead of her bringing out the list the manager Todd came out to us and went over options and even assured us they would cook our food in a fresh pan with new oil etc - which we thought was pretty great!  Our order of vegan choices were delicious...however, accidentally the waitress brought out shrimp dumplings instead of our vegetable dumplings and it wasn't discovered until I ate one and was halfway through the second one which might explain why it was extra delicious....(I AM SO SORRY SHRIMP FAMILY -- truly it was an accident)  The waitress felt so bad and apologized for the mistake - I am sure this will never happen again...she saw how choked up I was about it - as I was crying for the shrimp a little....but she was so empathetic and took full responsibility for the error and of course later a woman from the back (chef maybe?) came out to also apologize and made us a vegetable batch at no charge...At the end of the dinner, believe me the food for us was great, even for the two at our table that are carnivores they loved their chicken and enjoyed our vegan choices as well.  By the time we were done packing up our left overs - Todd came over again and had told us he had taken care of our dinner as well as gave us a card to come back again and try the vegan dishes all over again.  We couldn't have been more grateful for the AMAZING service from him as well as the wonderful people that he has on his team.  They may not be vegan now...but with that kind of care & compassion...it might be in their future one day.    We are now a fan of this PF Changs - I am huge on great service and I felt they completely handled it they way I would have and I am thrilled to see that in a large restaurant chain!  Great job!",

You have been good about this from time to time but there is NO MENU POLICY - store wide?  Today I spent a good but unnecessary dollar and your staff/mgmt/cooks were NOT WILLING to adjust the menu and it wasn't that busy - LAZY as far as I could see.   I'll wait till you have a new menu and an ad saying you care about the GLUTEN FREE movement?",

The service never waivers, the food is consistent, and the layout of this particular restaurant creates a smooth vibe. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the ribs, dry rub or sauce. For meals, Mongolian Beef, Salt & Pepper Prawns, and either honey shrimp or chicken or some of my favorites. If traveling to Vegas and you don't want to be a part of the strip, plenty of local hotels and shopping nearby.",

What I really like is their outside seating area. When it's winter time, they have heaters and clear covers in the patio area so that there's less cold air coming into the seating area. There was a large group of high school kids getting ready for homing coming that sitting across from us, a group of about 20, so if you're the type that likes to dine with a gigantic group, they have the capability to accommodate you, I'm sure they need notice for a group that large though.   I liked their food, it's basically over priced Chinese food with modernized, Chinese looking decor in the restaurant. Honestly, I'd rather go to some place in China Town. The only reason why we end up going to any PF Chang's is because we have a gift card. But, it does the job.   The service is great, very attentive... But I expect that, considering the location of this restaurant. :)",

My wife ordered the honey chicken with brown rice and I had the Korean bbq chicken stir fry. The meals came out in a very timely manner. The food was hot and prepared to both of our likings. The Korean bbq was a first for me. I would definitely order it again. The only real complaint I have is the cleanliness of the table we were seated at. The soy sauce bottle was stuck to the table. I tried with some force to free the bottle with no success. We both laughed about it and I gave it a quick karate chop to free it from the table. There was quite a ring of stickiness left on the table once the bottle had been displaced.  Overall very pleased with the meal and the service! I'm not sure if this is a sign or not but my fortune cookie was missing the fortune. I think my wife was afraid to ride home with me!",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars, I absolutely would. I have been frequenting this specific PF Changs for over ten years, but after tonight, I will never go again. I've been a huge fan since I was 12, and unfortunately tonight ruined it for me for the rest of my life. I went in for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend, whereupon we checked in with the two smug looking hostesses who didn't seem thrilled with their jobs.We watched as countless parties were seated before us as well as another party of three which was waiting since before we arrived. A gentleman from said party of three grew frustrated and went up to smug hostess number one and asked why some of these tables were sat before him, to which she explained the first table had a reservation, and he had overheard that the second table (a party of 4) did not have a reservation when they checked in but were still seated before him. He asked why and she didn't seem to have any answer but apologized lightly, he then resumed his seat and my boyfriend and I watched smug hostess number one look around for hostess number two, or any other employee for that matter, to make extra smug eye contact with as if to communicate her irritation with this group, though she was wrong. STRIKE ONE. Once my boyfriend and I were finally seated, a nice server came to help us. We both ordered ice waters without lemon. When the water arrived and I plunged my straw into said water, I was astonished to see a cloud of murk emerge from the depths of my cup. It looked like random white floaty shreds of gunk. I don't know what this unknown substance was, but needless to say, I lost my appetite. STRIKE TWO. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire establishment, and it made me feel dirty and I honestly can say I won't be going back ever. I'm sad about this because I love the garlic noodles here, but I will have to live without them for fear of eating from dirty dishes. It's disgusting. The health board should probably investigate this... I don't think proper procedure and cleanliness are being executed.",

I asked if we could have another complete set.  No apology what so ever.  I had to ask twice for a refill of my soda.  My wife asked how long for a couple spring rolls.  He said 5 min.  15 min later he asks if we were ready for desert.  No egg rolls had arrived yet!  He went to get them.  We waited another 15 min for the check.  Keep in mind all our dishes were picked up.  Finally it came and again no apology for any part of the poor service.  I placed my cc'd down and waited..... And waited..... And then some more.  My wife and I gave up and came up with the cash between both of us.  I did have to go to the bar and ask for change.  That part was fast and efficient!  The bartender even picked up I was a little upset.  He asked if I wanted to speak to a mgr but I declined as we just wanted out.  Well a mgr did find us.  She apologized for everything and did a great job.  I just don't think we'll be going back to that location anytime soon.",

For appetizers: The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were very good, especially with some of the hot chili paste mixed into soy sauce as a dipping sauce. The Dumplings (with pork) were tasty, but a little greasy.   For entrees: No one seemed to care for the veggie dish (Buddha's Feast?) with tofu, broccoli, green beans and mushrooms. The sauce was a little thick and a little too sweet. The Beef with Broccoli was my favorite. The orange chicken was good - crispy with an oniony background. (I'm not sure if this was the \"kids favorite\" Crispy Honey Chicken or the Orange Chicken, since the menu says they peel oranges for this dish, and I didn't see any orange peel, but there was definitely an orange flavor.) The shrimp served on top of crispy rice noodles (Crispy Honey Shrimp, I believe) was good, but the outsides of the shrimp had a slightly strange texture. The lo mein (served meatless) was decent, the rice was perfectly cooked.  Service was very good, something that's not easy with a party of 30.",
