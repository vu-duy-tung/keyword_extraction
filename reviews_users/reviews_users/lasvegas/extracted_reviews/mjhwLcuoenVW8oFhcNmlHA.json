I got the Blackened bow tie chicken pasta and the chicken wasn't blackened, it was shaved so thin you could barely tell the difference between the chicken and the pasta. There used to be a spice to it but now it tastes like nothing. My husband ordered the chicken club wrap and all you could taste was mayo and tiny bites of chicken. Needless to say I am very disappointed, if I wanted to eat bland food I could have stayed home and ate a jar of mayo for free!",

    "text": "The etymology of the phrase Claim Jumper suggests that you shouldn't trust this place - right? I mean would you really want a ride from a guy named Demolition Derby? I get this mental image of two guys sitting at a coffee shop at 4 in the morning, worn and tired from an all-night debate about whether to name their new restaurant Claim to Fame or Puddle Jumper - and then just giving up.  Every time I enter a new restaurant for the first time I half expect to get that sensation of walking into a casino for the first time, fascinated with all that's new and different and shiny, but unfortunately the reality is always dreadfully familiar when you walk into a chain restaurant.  Once again, as you open the menu you're hoping (beyond all hope) for something new, something exciting, something you didn't even know you wanted until just now. Then once again you find yourself disappointed by a menu that you're not even sure you haven't seen before. Sure sometimes they offer something that sounds different, but you've probably seen it at least somewhere else before.   After a few words from the server you would swear that this time that same-ole dish is going to be something really different, really unique, something revolutionary. A really great server at a chain restaurant has to be very convincing in their sales approach, and some of them are so good at painting a picture of uniqueness that, while you sit waiting for your food to arrive, you start imagining yourself as a regular here, a Norm so-to-speak - you almost want to walk around the room and introduce yourself so they can greet you as you walk through the door from now on.  Eventually, however, your food arrives and all hopes of becoming a local legend are dashed against the rocks of a bland pile of mashed potatoes and limp veggies. Oh sure it's not bad food, it has flavor, it has spice, maybe it even has a presentation that astounds. But when it comes down to it, all chain restaurants are pretty much alike.  Maybe you could even make an argument that some chain restaurants are better than others, but when it comes down to it they just don't compare. So if you find yourself inclined to rate chains against each other rather than \"real\" restaurants, you may think the Claim Jumper to be a rather good place with some rather good food and a decent offering of some non-standard fare...  ...that is, if you are so inclined.",

After about 10 minutes the host that sat us walked right by our table and never  paid any attention to us.

I have yet to eat in at this location and usually just l place an order to go.   It was a rainy Sunday and decided to order the fish tacos to go. This is one of my favorites and do to them usually having it as a lunch special I have had it many times . I am well aware that this chain normally takes a long time for their orders so the wait time was a bit long but the food makes it worth it. However on a Sunday there is no lunch special so for the fish tacos it's about $16. Got the food and checked it in the car, their was no side/fries. This would be fine if the price went with the order but I definetly  wanted my side for what we paid however did not want to wait another 30 minutes for fries. However when we called the manager Scott, he took care of us right away and the food tasted amazing. For that I am giving this location 4 stars for service. It's nice when a place takes care of an issue and takes care of its customers . It will definetly keep me coming back. Looking forward to their amazing food and going to try dining in next time.",

Overall experience was just ok, just a few irritating things that I've noticed. The party of 5 was seated aftet us, in the next booth, but they got their meal before us, 2 adults and a child. Also, the GM came by and ask how they were doing and not us. Are we not good enough for the GM to come by and say hi? That really made me feel unwanted in a restaurant that was 1/4 full. On a good note, every restaurant I dine at, I always ask for a milk shake. If they do have it, I tell them im not allergic to any thing so go ahead and be creative and surprise me. When I got my milkshake, it was delicious. Not sure was it was but I'm guessing it was a strawberry with chocolate chips.  So overall, the good outweighed the bad. Not really a \"go to\" restaurant when hungry but probably will dine there again.",

Our waiter was rude and kept giving everyone dirty looks, yes we were a big party but defiantly no excuse to give dirty looks and treat us badly. When refilling drinks he refilled some wrong, asked to have it fixed and he gave major attitude to my grandmother and said he can handle it .... Still brought back the wrong drinks (root beer instead of Dr Pepper) they just drank it anyways. One of the people at out table did not like their meal a manager came out and asked if there was something else they could get him he said can I just have ketchup and I will try to eat this, he tried didn't like it so asked for the drunken chicken to go. Nothing was compensated they tried to charge him for both he had to ask the server to take the bill back and take one off. I will never return to this restaurant!!!

Fish and chips are also awesome if you're seeking a bit of greasy goodness.  We were also confused about the whole point system but the manager cleared it up as far as what happened when we paid originally.  Basically the $25 that you pay into the system is deducted from each item instead of zeroing out the bill for $25.  I'm willing to bet this was an accounting piece that drove this which causes the wait staff tremendous pains.   The online ordering system isn't ready yet either which stinks.  Overall it's good American food, somewhat like Cracker Barrel.  Still a chain restaurant but not something you see everywhere.",

    "text": "For a gimmick eatery it's not as bad as you might think. The Yelp questionnaire says Good for Brunch, Lunch, etc. Claim Jumper is not good for anything. It's a place to take people whose gustatory senses have never been awakened.  If you grew up on pop tarts, mac & cheese and chicken tenders, Olive Garden, Applebee's, Chili's, Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumper are your kind of place.   Why \"claim jumper\"?  There's a fake gold mine wagon out front to tie in with the spurious \"concept.\" The interior is more like a ski lodge than anything to do with Old West mining settlements.  I wonder how Native Americans like eating at Claim Jumper. Their forebears were forced off their land by murderous '49ers.   I'm sure most patrons know of the '49ers only as a football team and are likely clueless what the Gold Rush was. \"Motherlode,\" as in Chocolate Motherlode Cake will have no meaning for them. It could explain why so many call it Claim \"Jumper's.\"   The music system sounds like a radio station that's only half tuned in. Tinny tunes blare over cheap speakers, setting your nerves on edge before your drinks even come.  We were treated to a steady blast of hot air from an overhead vent.  It was 80 degrees out. Why would they run the heat on a warm day?  Company policy I'm sure.  You couldn't ask for a nicer server than Dominica. A perfect angel. She refilled our Arnold Palmers for nothing. She wears a rock that's worth probably a year's pay for me. The bill does the math for you:  A 20% tip, calculated before taxes. Kudos to Claim Jumper for getting that right!  While we waited an inordinately long time for our order (it was mid-afternoon) we were treated to complimentary cheese bread, like angel food cake with cheese flavored icing.  We know not to expect this type of eatery to give away anything of value.  I had a \"widow maker\" cheeseburger for $14.  Not bad. 1371 calories, 2732 mg of sodium.  What is that, a tablespoon of salt?  I'm glad I went for the tasty Thai slaw instead of shoestring fries.  Lucinda was happy with her burger.  Dani had a child's meal of mac & cheese while finicky Sandy barely touched his bowtie pasta.  The portions are not huge.  Maybe that's a dinner feature. Gluttonous portions are just a gimmick to divert attention from mediocre fare.  It was Dani's birthday.  We like Dani so we eschewed the cringeworthy forced celebration by restaurant staff.  How sad to recruit strangers to sing \"Happy Birthday\" for you. Kinda like a Jumbotron proposal.  Note:  I saw Jerika's review about a \"booger\" on a spoon.  I wasn't going to mention it but I had to ditch my place setting and grab one from a nearby table. The napkin had unidentified debris stuck to it. The knife had a particle of baked-on food.  Soiled linen and cutlery and leaving the heat running are sure signs this establishment suffers from poor attention to detail.",

They seemed to be substituting huge portions instead of focusing on the quality of the food they were serving. I had the Jambalaya which was greasy, had far too many onions (seemingly half the bowl) and the whole bowl had taken on an unappetizing mix of brown and black instead of the bright oranges and reds I would expect of quality Jambalaya.  My dining companion had the Tri-Tip steak which he said tasted good but he hypothesized that the mashed potatoes they were placed on tasted like they were made from potato flakes.  The one redeeming thing was the salads we stared the meal with. The spinach salads really were delicious... I only wish I had ordered the meal-size one and forgone anything else.

    "text": "I have eaten here a few times in the past month and really like it. My favorite dish is the slices of tri tip roast. I always ask for it as rare as possible and pretty consistently get what in a steak house would be called medium rare which is what I like. The reason for the five star rating is that I can get a generous \"red meat\" meal that is blood red at far less than you would pay at a steak house. The sides, such as mashed potatoes, potato pancakes, or grilled vegetables are also good. The dinner dish also comes with soup and their clam chowder is excellent. On a couple of occasions dining companions have raved about the chicken pot pie. In summary, generous portions of good food at good prices. You can also join their dining club which costs $25 but then gets you two $25 credits and lets you earn a 10% credit on all your meals.",

I had never been to one of these, even though I had lived in Las Vegas and the Phoenix area the last decade or so.  What we had... I had the Grilled Liver, Bacon and Onions - A huge plate of Liver with an equally ungodly amount of Onions with a side Biscuit that was the consistency of a BRICK! If you closed your eyes... the Bacon tasted like NOTHING!  Keith had Sliders (Mini Cheeseburgers)... I got to try a couple of these little guys... and no flavor whatsoever despite the warnings of extra-sharp cheese on the menu. Keith also had a bowl of New England Claim Chowder before the meal... he told me not to order it next time.  Kathy had the Snow Crab and Chive Quiche with a Small Green Salad - I got to try the quiche later... again no flavor! It looked as appetizing as heck, though. HUGE dish!  For Dessert... the Brownie Finale... another HUGE dessert! Probably tasted the best... because of all the SUGAR!   Even their cups of Coffee were HUGE!  In summary... I would not mind the high prices if the food had any kind of flavor... but unfortunately they didn't!  Update from my Chef son, Kevin... He said to order the Soups... they're especially good from what he said!",

I ordered from the happy hour menu and my wife decided she wanted the halibut from the main menu. We waited 25 minutes before we got the food and the bar area only had 3 other tables w customers! Immediately, we noticed the halibut smelled VERY strong and my wife took a bite and there was no flavor. She said it tasted like it was frozen. She asked to change her selection and the waitress said ok. She returned w a regular menu and did not bring the happy hour menu. My wife selected 2 items that we knew were on the happy hour menu. We ate our meal and got the check. The 2 items she selected, were charged full price from the regular menu, not the happy hour menu. I asked the waitress about the extra charge and she said, well, your wife selected from the menu, I told her, you didn't bring the happy hour menu and you know I selected 3 items from it, so why wouldn't the price be from the HH menu? She huffed and left and came back 10 minutes later and just dropped off the bill. The manager took ten dollars off instead of changing the ticket to show what was actually ordered. By now, we're frustrated and just pay the bill.  You've lost a couple of regulars and when we had guests, we would always go to CJ's, but not anymore.",

After that she goes away and came back apologizing. Saying that our order is being made. After that shows up with some cheese bread. The bread is good. Though would be better if some butter was offered. Food shows up. Did not take long. Huge portions.  Great fries. Really good food. Overall throughout the rest of the meal the service was good. The wait at the beginning seems to have just been an oversight at the time.  The food and the service later more than made up for it. I would recommend this place.

    "text": "The 4 of us went here on a Friday afternoon mid August.  It was my son's 20th birthday and we did the whole call ahead seating and also mentioned it was his birthday.  Well we get there around 1:30 and the place has barely any people in it.  It's not like the Claim Jumper of prior that I remember.  Usually this place is busy.  Anyway, we had one lady take our drink order and then she said she was passing us off to another server.  I figured maybe her shift was over......but yet they just opened at 11:00 a.m.  So we get our drinks and we proceed to order.    We got the shrimp avocado dip, a bbq chicken salad, a chicken pasta dish, a mini pizza and garden salad and sliders.  When I order my pizza I get the whole spiel about it being a mini pizza and only 4\" basically I guess trying to upsell.  I say I'm fine with it being a mini and our server stops pressing.  I guess they train the staff to do this since the table behind us ordered a mini pizza also and I heard the same speech given to them.  Another annoying aspect was when my son ordered his salad and his GF ordered her pasta dish, the server said \"I will give you the lunch portion on that.  It's a bit smaller but also cheaper\" or something along those lines.  I'm thinking \"No sh** they want the lunch version.  One, it's lunchtime and TWO the hostess opened our menus right to the lunch section before handing us the menus.\"  The dip was okay.  It was sort of like ceviche.  It was good but a bit hot.  The jalapenos for me anyway were a bit much.  My garden salad was just ok.  I mean, you could tell it had been pre-made and stored in a freezer/fridge.  The lettuce leaves had that see through type quality when you try to freeze then defrost it.  And the croutons were sweet.  It was kind of odd.  So we get our main order.  My husband's sliders were just barely ok.  He seemed to like them, however I think McDonald's makes a better burger.  The fries were good though.  My son's salad was huge (you could definitely split even the lunch size) and tasted okay.  He really seemed to enjoy it. The pasta dish was a big portion also but a bit bland.  And my tomato basil pizza was just barely okay.  I wanted a side of marinara with it but our server never came back.  We had to flag down another person just to grab a side of sauce.  The kicker was at the end no mention of a Happy Birthday or anything.  This was after we specifically mentioned it to the hostess.  The only other time we saw our waiter was when he brought the bill and came to get the payment.  Our bill came to $66 and change.  I will NOT be going back.  It's funny because prior to getting our food my husband and I were asking the waiter about a vegetarian menu since we were thinking of bringing my husband's niece here to eat.  However, after what I feel was a lack of good service and just barely okay food, I won't be heading there anytime soon.  I'm just glad my son seemed to like it and I just held my tongue until I could come on here and vent.",

All was fine except for the pasta. For $18.99, the portion was very small, the pasta was over cooked, the shrimp was cold, and there were exactly 3 slivers of sausage. We expressed our disappointment with the Jambalaya with our server who brought over the manager. We discussed the dish with him as well and his response was to ask us if we had ever been to their restaurant and/or had that dish there before. We told him that we had not and when the bill arrive the Jambalaya was on the check. To not spoil the experience for everyone else in our party, I told the family that I had forgotten something at the table and that I would meet them in the car. When they walked out of the restaurant I asked for the manager again. He came over and I expressed my disappointment on how the matter was handled and how he did not offer to make it right somehow. His response was effectively that was how his restaurant served that dish and to have a good night. Needless to say that we will not be going back.",

I went to the one in Henderson when I moved here back in '03 and I remember it being very good.  I don't know if they've all gone downhill or just this location.  First of all it took about 20 mins to get our drinks and another 10 before our order was taken.  30 minutes to place an order on a Saturday at 1pm?  Not that it mattered because they could have brought out random plates from the kitchen and still would have gotten the same amount of orders right.  The waiter was nice enough but when we pointed out the errors he replied \"What do you want me to do?\"  Well after waiting almost an hour to get our crappy, cold, incorrect food we didn't want to risk sending it back to the kitchen and wait for them to correct it.  We were told \"the kitchen was slammed\" ... did he not know we were sitting in the same room he was?  And that we have eyes?  Because the place was less than half full so I fail to see how they could be \"slammed\", which by the way is also not my problem.  I don't care if the manager didn't staff properly or people called in, you're supposed to be professionals at this level, its not Burger King.  Anyway, my pretzel appetizer was wrong, my blackened chicken pasta was cold and bland, and they make mojitos with ground leaves for you to choke on.  I was really disappointed and doubt I'll go back to any Claim Jumpers as there are so many other places to try in LV.",

Let me start off by saying the staff was wonderful! Our server Donnie was excellent.  We Never felt rushed and timing between drinks, salad and entrees were perfect. What I didn't expect were the prices! I had fish and chips for $17.99. Honestly, if I had gone to\" Long john silver's\" l don't think I could have tasted the difference. This was not quality food. All I tasted was batter, oil and a lot of SALT! Couldn't really taste the fish. The fries were tough and not tasty at all. Love French fries and cant see how you can mess them up that bad. Side salad and bread was good though. My Mother's breaded shrimp with pasta was ok. The shrimp was also incredibly salty. We each had a glass of wine with dinner for a whooping $56.00 dinner for two. Don't mind paying a little more for good quality food, but 18 bucks for bad fish and chips. Not priceless.",

    "text": "Bad service, bad food.  Came here on a Friday night with my parents and bf and it took forever to order or get any service because the server rarely came by our table. It's understandably busy since it's a Friday night but we noticed that he would go back and forth to the other tables and ignored us until we finally asked someone to track him down. We ordered the Black Tie Chicken Pasta, the Ribeye, and the Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes with two clam chowders & the potato and cheddar soup.   One word to describe the food: SALTY! So. So. Salty. We barely touched the meatloaf & mashed potatoes and even the soups because of how inedible it was! The Black Tie Pasta tasted like cafeteria food - so bland and DRY. We had to ask for extra sauce on the side and it still didn't help.   The only thing we partially enjoyed was the Ribeye and the bread that they offered (which was also really hard to get because again, the server was a no show the entire meal.)   We found it so funny that the server only started getting nice and showing up when we got the bill.  We decided not to complain since thankfully we had a gift card that paid for our meal but definitely not going to come back here again.",

Unfortunately 2* for carry out. They just recently started charging for carry out orders. This isn't a tip for the carry out servers, it's a service tax. It's not very high but everytime I call ahead they give me an approximate 20 minute wait. I always give them 30 minutes and my food is never ready. Make sure you double check everything before you leave too! I feel like there's always something missing from my order.   I love their food I only wish their service matched. I do keep coming back hoping carry out will change but I'll just have to deal with it.",

    "text": "Claim Jumper's is fine for what it is. It's a chain restaurant that serves up hearty comfort food. We had a CJ gift card burning a hole in our pocket and suggested this spot for our family get-together.   Their menu is ginormous. In fact, it reminds me of a slightly smaller version of the Cheesecake Factory menu. It's loaded with options that range from salads, burgers, pastas, steaks-- think American pub style entrees.   Here's how it went down...   Chicken Pot Pie An iconic and delicious calorie bomb. 3 out of 5 of us ordered this, It had a perfectly flaky and buttery crust filled with creamy sauce and chunks of chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. They serve it with a cup of mixed fruit (honeydew, grapes, and cantaloupe).  Yum.  Pasta My brother-in-law always orders the Jambalaya pasta. This dish is made with a creole sauce and pepper, onions, sausage, chicken and shrimp. It's creamy, spicy, and filling---everything you want from comfort food. However, I really think you'd be safe ordering any pasta dish here.  Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sweet Potato A giant sweet potato topped with jerk chicken, chives, and papaya relish. My potato and chicken were a little cold. I didn't send it back and just ate it the way it was. My overall feeling for this dish- Meh. I should've stuck with what I know and ordered the pot pie.  Again, I feel this spot is A-Ok for what it is. The family loves their Chicken Pot Pie - I'm sure we'll be back just for that. Their portions are extremely generous. Make sure you come here hungry.",

But in the last 5yrs we haven't been very often, not because we didn't like the food, just not any particular reason. We often talked about going just never made it. After reading reviews, was a little hesitant to go, but decided to give it a shot to see for ourselves. We went at about 1130a and the restaurant was nearly empty. We remembered how big the portions were, so as usual my daughter and I shared an entree. We got the Chicken cobb sandwich with fries. Hubby ordered the fried zucchini appetizer which was new to us, and the widow maker burger with fries and a wedge salad. Other daughter ordered the fish and chips with a ceasar salad.   Never to disappoint , the appetizer and entree's were more than enough. fried zucchini was so good, I ate quite a few pieces. The cobb sandwich had a nice lite bun. but I didn't even finish half of the half I had because I ate some of hubbys wedge salad and a couple bites(2) of his burger, plus some of the fries. We were all pleased with our orders and service. We didn't get the motherlode cake for dessert as we used to do in the past, just box it right up. We were already bringing home leftovers.   All in all, it was a good experience for us. by the time we left the restaurant, it was pretty full.",

They have a nice selection of lunch items all for reasonable prices and large portions. I ordered a lunch portion chinese chicken salad and it was huge. Full of sliced chicken breast, wontons, cabbage and lettuce and a great dressing. It tasted fresh and was full of flavor. My coworkers ordered everything from a huge topping filled baked potato to fish tacos and pasta. They all enjoyed their food as well.   I think Claim Jumper must be under new ownership because this place has improved since the last time I was here. The food tastes better and the service is good.",

I got a chicken tenderloin that was probably Walmart packaged and was complete bland and tasted worse than nothing. I rather taste nothing than cardboard because that's what my chicken tasted like! My wife got a California citrus salad which all the lettuce being all wilted and just disgusting.   Service wasn't that great at all. Our server didn't even notice our unhappy attitudes and our passive complaints. Didn't have a clue what was going on. We're not the type to complain and try and get a free meal out of no one we pay for what we eat rather it tasting bad or great. Unfortunately this time it was a bad one.. server came by maybe 3 times within the hour and 20 mins that we dined there ! Not one refill and the place want even that packed at all!

The appetizers were served and not but three minutes later our food was in front of us, our soups and our meals, not giving us any time to enjoy our appetizers... If it was not for the fact that we were with family we haven't seen in forever it would have been a very disappointing evening. What made it worse is the manager couldn't even give a decent apology, we won't be going back. And by the way they changed the lemon cake (which they didn't tell us) and it was absolutely horrible it was dry and tasteless, the chocolate cake was still as good as ever maybe we will order that to go....we were embarrassed we had recommended this place to our company. There are too many places to eat in this town there is NO excuse for bad service and too expensive to have sub par food...off our list.",

    "text": "Although this is a neighborhood restaurant for me I've only ventured in during happy hour that runs from 3-7pm Monday through Friday and only available in the bar area.  I always applaud a place that offers specials of appropriate portions that not only satisfy a budget but flavor as well.  During this last visit I tried the tacos which were tastier than I expected and gave a nice appetizer.  As with any time I eat out I try either fish or a salad and really liked the chinese chicken salad since it quite a huge portion but had ample amounts of chicken.  Sure this place is a chain but the Happy Hour along with having actually good food is enough reason to stop in for a bite to eat.",

We waited almost 30 minutes before we could even place our order, then it was almost an hour before the food came out. My husband never even got his meal and after they brought out the rest of our meals the manager came out and said I'm sorry we're out of Alfredo sauce. It took them an hour and a half for then to tell us this. We were expected to eat without silverware and asked for ketchup twice before it Appeared after the food got cold. Then the straw that broke the camel's back was when I opened up the chicken pot pie and it was a flour pasty mess and not the creamy sauce it usually is. Gross. The manager did take it off my bill but none the less we wasted almost 2 hours and left hungry.",

    "text": "It was unplanned for us to go here for lunch on a football Sunday.  We approached the hostess to let her know that there are 12 of us including 3 highchairs.  I wish I knew her name, but from there she gave an attitude to where we were inconveniencing her.  Honestly, it didn't even look that busy except for the bar for those watching the game.  Our table was huge!! I loved how we had a lot of room for our food and drinks without having to worry about getting rid of unnecessary things or the babies knocking things over.  It was also spacious, so it didn't feel like it was congested.  Our server was Angie and was an amazing waitress.  She was patient, kept a smile on her face, and would hold a conversation with us.  With having 3 babies fussing and making a mess, she offered a free baby dish for each so they can stay occupied.  I couldn't believe it, they offer a Baby Dish... for FREE!!  It comes with soft turkey, cheese, apple sauce, and mandarin orange.  I ordered Parmesan Chicken with tomato sauce and spinach with spaghetti noodles.  It was good, but I can't say that I will go back and get it again.  My husband got the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was pretty good.  It was any ordinary salad but with chicken and shredded cheese.  I gave an overall 4 stars because of the waitress and how comfortable I was there.  The food was decent, but didn't wow me.  And finally, I wasn't a fan of the hostess' attitude.",

Ordered our appitizers (potato skins and artichoke dip) next and they came out after about 10 minutes. Placed our dinner order.....during our conversation and after 10 minutes into the appitizers....the salads appear!! What? We weren't asked if we're ready...finished with appitizers etc. So here are two young ladies standing at our table with salads. I sent mine back and one was left on the table...not five minutes later the darn dinner appears. Really? Seriously, the place was hardly busy and we were completely rushed through the meal. The manager came by to rectify the situation and I explained that the 'nice dinner' we were expecting was ruined due to lack of communication with the customer.  He deducted $20 from the bill which was a very nice gesture but still the dinner was a big negative. As for the food....the tri tip was dry and well done when it was ordered rare. The half chicken was dried out as well, roasted veggies were the only thing that was made fresh on the plate. The highlight was that the beer was cold, the sangria was good and Fireball/Angry Orchard was an unique combination.  In the past we have enjoyed happy hour at the bar and thought that dinner would be a nice treat for our out of town guests. Methinks Not.",

Server came up immediately after we were seated asking for our drink order and if we would like any appetizers. I love a quick and attentive server, we then ordered our drinks and said we needed a little more time to decide on appetizers.   She brought our drinks and we ordered the Southwest egg rolls which were very delicious and filling! My main course was chicken fried steak.   Wow,the Country Fried Steak is very large and very juicy and delicious mmm and their gravy is heavenly! It also comes with mashed potatoes which are just as good. I could not even finish the whole meal because their portions are VERY generous!   Even though I was stuffed I still had to order dessert because I always have a sweet tooth after eating dinner. I ordered their Chocolate Mother lode Cake OH WOOOW this thing was huge!!! This was the Mother load of a chocolate paradise and very scrumptious!   I will definitely be returning to this Claim Jumpers great food and great service!",

    "text": "HUGE.  FRIGGIN'.  PORTIONS.  Holy cow, does Paul Bunyan eat here?  I've been to this place a couple times now, and man...do they know how to deal in excess.  Just about everything here is huge, drinks, food, even half the people that visit here are huge.  That's not to make fun of them, but you know where there's big people, there must be big food.  I'm a big boy myself.  The appetizers here themselves can almost be full fledged meals.  Try the Nacho Platter ($8.25) and add some chicken ($2.00).  This plate comes out gigantic.  It's like almost a pile of nachos like 6 inches high.  It's got your standards, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, diced tomatoes and black beans with salsa on the side.  They use Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese, and a lot of it.  It's pretty good.  That's not much coming from me though, I even like plain nacho chips with cheese from Taco Bell!  Just make sure you share it (with like 3-4 people) because you definitely got more than enough to spread the wealth.  If you really wanna kill yourself though before your entree arrives, get the Appetizer Combo($19.95).  This this will topple over your table!  It's got Artichoke, Buffalo Wings, Zucchini, Mozzarella Sticks, Parmesan Garlic Rings, Loaded Skins, Cheese Potatocakes, and Southwest Eggrolls.  You also get some sauces like Ranch, and Marinara for dipping.  It does look like most of the stuff on this platter is frozen then fried....but oh well.  At least you get to enjoy looking at ALL of it, it's not for faint of heart.  This platter alone will feed 5 easily.  I usually end up ordering an appetizer for the table, so I almost always try to pick a smaller entree for dinner.  I usually end up with pizza or a sandwich.  I like the Clubhouse Sandwich ($12.95), well, because I like club sandwiches.  This one's got Fresh Turkey, Sweet Ham, Bacon, Gouda, Muenster, Garlic Mayo, Tomato and Greens all on white or wheat bread.  This sandwich comes out stacked!  I usually only manage to finish half of it before I ask for a doggie bag.  It also comes with seasoned fries which are light and crispy when they are fresh.  They also have a lot of home cooked favorites and specialties.  Anything from rotisserie chicken, aged steaks,  meatloaf, Country Fried Steak, pot roast, chicken pot pie, even liver & onions.  They make a killer turkey supper as well.  And all your entree's are HUGE, you could probably feed 2 people off one plate.    You can't leave here without trying the desserts!  Your heart will pitter-patter before it drops dead of a heart attack from your appetizer and entree.  But you just might be able to fit in a monster dessert before you keel over!  They have a dessert called the Chocolate Motherlode Cake ($9.95).  It IS the motherlode!  It's 6 (yes 6) layers of chocolate cake with chocolate chips, walnuts, and chocolate fudge frosting!  This cake is so tall from the layers, you have to lie the slice down to avoid it from falling!  Leaning Tower of Cake!  The night we had it, it was moist and decadent.  But the leftovers the next day were kinda dry (I should've covered it with a lightly damp paper towel).  But still good with some vanilla ice cream.  I heard their Mud Pie is exceptional and HUGE as well.  This is a family-type restaurant so it's pretty kid friendly.  Their service is ok most times, but if it gets busy (like on weekends) your server might take a little long to get back to your table.  But the servers I've had were always nice.  But if you're looking for a romantic evening you probably don't want to go here.  Go to Roy's down the street or something if you want some alone time with your sweetie.  But try Claim Jumper, you will like it!  Just don't overdo it, because you're gonna have one hell of a tummy ache and extra miles on your treadmill if you eat too much.  Oh well, you gotta work out anyway because you may be lugging a BIG bag of leftovers home.",

She said that they ran out of paper plates and when I asked her how will my guests eat the salad, she just shrugged and said that they don't have paper plates.  I had to ask for to go boxes as an option.  When I got back to the office with our lunch, she did not put the dressing for the salad.

Since it was getting close to 8 p.m., I asked the server if they could put the TV on The Voice so I would not miss the first part of it.  The server said she would have to ask the Manager (Craig).  His response to her (never came over to our table) was NO.  Upon leaving, I asked to speak to him and I told him how unhappy I was at the situation about the TV channel.  His response was \"we only do sports events\".  Of course I knew this to be False as I know they had the Academy Awards on.  But, the thing that bothered me the most was his expression, which was \" LADY, I am uninterested in your comments with a stone-faced expression\".  My husband and I go there at least once a week, we are Rewards Members.  I then went to the Claim Jumper website (Internet) and filled out a complaint and I have not had any response from that either.  Thought the public would like to know about this!  I doubt we will return to Claim Jumper, Summerlin again.",

    "text": "Ever since my brother attended UC Irvine, I have been hearing him rave about the food and the huge portions they serve at Claim Jumpers.  Back then there were no Claim Jumpers in NorCal (at least not that I am aware of, until they opened one in Fremont, CA a few years back).  Anyway, since coming to Las Vegas, I found one in Summerlin that is not too far from me and I actually drive past it fairly often on my way to and from school. So one evening I decided to stop by and try this location with some friends.  It was my second or third time at any Claim Jumpers, but the others were old pros and knew the menu and exactly what favorites to order.  I studied the menu and finally decided on a full slab of Beef Back Ribs that is \"slow-roasted then flame broiled and loaded with flavor\". When it came out, my dinner does indeed look massive. But ribs from a cow is big normally, but I had no problem polishing it off since it was mostly bones. Although it wasn't as flavorful as advertised, and in a BBQ class I attended, we made better beef ribs oveall as a class.  And compared to their BBQ Baby Back Pork Rib I had tried at the Fremont, CA location, it wasn't as good relatively.  Anyway, we were mainly there for the desserts, so the table of 3 ordered and split the Chocolate Motherlode Cake, I Declair, and Lemon Bar Brulee. Our waitress thought we were crazy, but was happy that we each ordered a dessert = bigger tips on a bigger bill.  And overall, I thought the dessert was good.  Nothing fancy about it, just the huge portions loaded with way too much sugar and calories that people come here for.  Chocolate Motherlode Cake - Good, but after while the chocolate overload took over and I was done with this dessert. Don't try to eat this alone, unless you really love a lot a lot of chocolate.  Lemon Bar Brulee - The tartness helped cleansed the palette from the chocolate and slab of ribs, and this one we actually finished. Would totally order this one again, even if I am not sharing.  I Declair - It was okay. Really big and unwieldy as a dessert to fit in the mouth, but easily cut down to big mouthful portions. The whipped cream gave it volume, but it was forked aside and didn't add much to the dessert.  Location - near Boca Park in the SW. Very nice area. Parking is not an issue unless you want a spot right by the door, otherwise the strip mall has plenty of parking for the businesses in it. It is a little far for visitors to Las Vegas, unless you rent your own car.  Service was average but friendly. We were mostly left alone in our corner booth table the majority of the time we were there. 3 stars.  Food - 3 stars. Just A-OK. Portions are big, but you also pay adequately for it. The draw is not the quality of food served, but the relatively large portion size (except on ribs... a full slab is a full slab). So in my opinion you are not getting any steals from the price to value perspective.  Good for groups, especially for desserts? I think so, especially if your group wants to split a big dessert.",

She of course got our order wrong and with a shrug of her shoulders left it. We wanted to order dessert, but weren't even given the option to. Just a simple here's the bill and walked away.  I wanted to speak to her manager but never saw her again after dropping the bill. I really can't believe had bad she did at her job. Again, food was good but she made the dining miserable.",

The menus are big - there must be two or three hundred options.  The appetizer and main course portions are big - I felt as full as if just eaten Thanksgiving dinner.  The desserts are big enough for 2-6 people depending on which one you order.  Okay so they have quantity, what about quality.  Everything I tried tasted very good including the Ceasars salad, rotisserie chicken, fish and chips, and cheesecake. The dishes are simply but skillfully prepared - like great home cooking. I decided to go with three stars rather than four because I felt like I, as a customer, somehow got lost in all the bigness of the place. Despite good service I felt like I was along for the ride in this restaurant concept rather than in the drivers seat.",

Why is there no system of notifying a server when some is sat down?   Food was just ok. Drinks were decent. Server was nice.

First of all our waiter wasn't the friendliest. He kept cutting us off midway through our order to hold on and would run to the back. There was only one other couple there so it's not like he was busy.   When we asked him for menu suggestions he advised us that he was a vegetarian that ate fish and chicken and couldn't give us many suggestions   When we put in our drink order came back with one of the drinks and he told us that the bartender was just sent home to catch a flight and the remaining staff only knew how to make one of the two drinks we ordered. It would have been nice if they could have let us order a round before the bartender was cut especially because we asked for the drink menu.   When I ordered my steak he asked how I wanted it cooked. I said however the chef recommends and he has the nerve to insinuate that the chefs were Hispanic and liked things over cooked and I said the chef that created the menu not the line cooks. Nevertheless I asked for a medium rare steak and got a well done steak instead.   Truly disappointing and not like the claim jumper I'm used to for a meal that cost us over $100.",

It has been years since we have ate Claim Jumper so we were excited to go.    It started off ok. We had a lady greet us saying she was helping our server out.  Being a server myself, I totally understand that sometimes it gets busy and we all need help at times.  When our server came to our table by the name of a Phil, he was a little pushy and wanted to take our order right away. We asked for a couple more minuets  We ordered our appetizer and all of our meals.  After waiting nearly 45 minuets and still not receiving our appetizer  in a not so busy restaurant our server Phil came out with our food.   We  asked Phil why our appetizer had not shown up. The confused look on his face made us believe he never put the order in, and told us he was going to go ask the Chef.  After about 10 minutes he finally came back with our appetizer, and walked away really quick. Before my fiance could say ANYTHING about his steak being  Extremely undercooked he was gone  we waited several more minutes for him to come. Meanwhile the three of us had already gone through half of our meals and my fiance sitting there waiting.   He took the steak back to the kitchen and the chefs literally put the same steak that had already been cut back on the grill, including the pieces that had been cut off. Major health code violation.    When the steak finally arrived back it STILL wasn't cooked enough.  but we couldn't tell Phil because we literally never saw him again.   After 20 or so minutes he came back and asked us if we were ready for desert or the check. He never refilled any of our drinks, never asked if we needed anything else, never came back to check if we were ok.     We ended up asking for the check. He was quick to drop it off.  But then had the lady who originally greeted us run the card. I have to say this was probably the worse dining experience we have had in a long time.  And it being their Birthday dinner really made it that much worse.   I HATE writing reviews like this, but when we only get together a couple times a year for a nice dinner it's disappointing when the experience is terrible",

Unfortunately over time the customer service and quality of food has declined as well as the portion sizes. A couple of years ago I went on my birthday to celebrate with family. We had the rudest and most condescending server that I made a point to speak to her manager on the phone the very next day. He did apologized and offered us a free entree for our next visit. Which we did came back 2 weeks later and the service was a lot better.   Fast forward 2 years and after a change in management and staff things have gotten so much worse. I went on my birthday this past May 2018 and the server while friendly she was a bit slow to serve us as we would've liked. No, it wasn't super busy that day either. We consumed a good amount money because we ordered drinks. My family had told her and her manager that we were celebrating my birthday when they stopped by the table to ask how everything was. Like I said we spent a good amount of money there and the least they could've done was a complimentary cake like most restaurants do and they used to do but no there wasn't. That was a disappointment only because when you cut corners like that you lose good customers.",

I dont remember who the company was previously owned by, but ever since Landrys took over ownership a couple years ago, this place has declined since then. They not only changed their menu a bit eliminating some items, but their food quality has went down. Somehow I keep thinking this place will be what it once used to be, but last two times Ive went, I am disappointed and feel like I'm wasting money. The \"complimentary\" bread they gave us was awful. Stale and flavorless. Tasted like someone threw it in the microwave and sprinkled some garlic salt on top. Pretzel sticks appetizer, the sticks were burned on the bottom. Cashew chicken sandwich bread was soggy. On another occasion, there was plastic wrapping in the burger. The bloody mary I ordered was just mediocre. I wont be back anymore. Im surprised the other great restaurants in this area haven't run this place out of business.",

We've since come back on a Sunday afternoon with our friends and have been satisfied each time with the bar area's happy hour menu and a nice cozy place to hang out.  I don't know what the happy hour times are now, but the last time I called in they were changing them I think.

The decor was a wee bit less posh than some of the other CJs I've been to though. I had the black tie pasta dish...thought it came with peas but mine was missing them. I ordered the 1/2 portion and couldn't eat it all. Huge portions! My partner had the lobster tail with roast veggies and he can usually eat....but left most of his veggies as there was just so much food.  They don't have the amazing salad bar that CJ's in California and other areas have. They do have a great children's menu though. We ordered an \"I Declair\" for dessert - $10 but it's a monstrous dessert that feeds 6 or 8 adults. Needless to say, we left much of it untouched.  Service was top notch as always. I'm amazed that this place wasn't busier than we'd seen at other CJs, but it seems that Vegas is in a bit of a \"post recession\" withdrawal and many places are a bit empty.",

While I was looking over the menu I noticed some of the ladies at the table were only going to order dessert. I already knew what their plan was..order a humongous dessert take three bites and say they are too full to finish. This is just what some girls do...but not me. I didn't want the table to think I was pig. I mulled it over in my mind for about a second... than I thought.. who was I fooling my husband already knows I like to eat. It's no secret even when we were dating I didn't hide that fact ..he may think something is wrong with me if I don't eat! I then placed my order for my appetizer a cup of Potato Cheese Soup and my main entree The Whiskey Apple Glazed Chicken. The soup was nice and creamy with bits of potatoes in it and tiny bacon strips on the top. It was really hearty and oh so good! The Whiskey Chicken was served with this sweet whiskey apple sauce and served over apple sourdough herb stuffing, with red-skin mashed potatoes, and roasted vegetables on the side. The melody of flavors went really well together. It reminded me of a dish you would have for Thanksgiving or Christmas. This entree also comes with the Cheesy Garlic Toast which is my favorite. They are usually served with marinara sauce if you get it as an appetizer. Since this came with my meal there was no sauce but the taste could definitely stand by itself. The portions here are really big..I got the lighter portion for 11.95 and still could not finish it. I had to take the other half home!",

I still cannot figure out why people like this place?  I've had their pasta, their fish & chips, their chicken and probably a salad and every time I ate their food, I want to vomit.  The funny thing?  My husband has been here probably five times and every time he runs home to go to the bathroom.  Yes, their portions are huge.  Its very \"old-fashion family style food\" would be the best way to explain it.  But to me, it does not taste fresh at all.  We went here last night (that was my fourth and final time I will ever go to Claim Jumper) their soda was completely flat. gross.  They tried to get us non-flat soda, but it didn't work.    We started with their \"famous\" cheese bread.  Nothing famous about this.  And it came with a marinara sauce.  The waitress came to clear the table and said \"weird... that sauce looks really pasty\"  ewww!  My husband ordered the pork tenderloin, with mashed potatoes and stuffing.  Disgusting.  He ate most of it, but he was starving, but it didn't look good.  I had the fish & chips- batter was horribly thick, to the point that i could easily take off the batter and just eat the fish.  We woke up this morning promising each other that we would never go there again.",

That night we found out that our favorite menu items were removed or replaced with cheaper, and much lower quality menu items.   Tonight for a change we thought we would try it again. The ONLY reason we did was because this was the place we would always take friends and family when they came for a visit. As we struggled to find something on the menu we ordered drinks. I ordered their draft Hefeveiwen and was told it would be served in a frosted glass. It was not. I was told they have a \"Chiller\" that sometimes frosts the glasses, wasn't happy and asked that it be taken away and ordered a soda.   Real simply I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. My wife and kids received their meals and everything was going good until I put the whipped butter on top of my mashed potatoes. It wouldn't even melt. Some people wouldn't complain but I asked the server for \"Hot\" potatoes. She apologized and went to get me fresh mashed potatoes. I was also served a brick of a biscuit that I didn't even touch. When the potatoes came I put them on my plate and tried them. Well.......friggen barley warm! Now I'm just plain pissed. The manager comes over and asked if those were better? Hell no they aren't! She promises me that the food sits in a warmer and they scoop them out of that. I don't give a crap! IT IS STILL FRIGGEN COLD!!!!!!!!! Well she leaves in a huff and says that she is gonna get this right! 2 minutes later someone(not my server or the manager) sets a small plate of microwaved mashed potatoes on the table. Screw it! I'm not eating them.   As far as I'm concerned I am DONE with Claim Jumpers. What a great way to F*^% up a good restaurant. Thanks, but NO THANKS!! I will NEVER be back, and will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "While I have never particularly been wowed by Claim Jumper's lunch and entree items I have learned to stick with their appetizer and happy hour items. A recent visit here has reaffirmed that sentiment.  I was in the area after driving around the city and doing Christmas shopping and I was hungry. I ordered a mini BBQ chicken pizza and a order of the southwestern egg rolls.   The egg rolls, one of my favorite items, were very delicious. I could tatse a lot of it's components from the nice chunks of chicken, to all of the corn and black beans. It came with a Asian type slaw that was a nice cool, crunchy, and slightly sweet compliment to the egg rolls. The bbq chicken pizza had a nice soft crust, cooked yet still slightly crisp onions, chunks of chicken, and a nice bbq sauce.  Service was excellent. I was acknowledged almost instantly when I walked through the door, my waiter came and took my order promptly, and everything that I ordered came out correct, hot, and fast.  My only grip was that the pizza, for being a mini, was comparable in price to the egg rolls. I forgot this fact since I normally come during happy hour. But whatever, it was still good.",

    "text": "What's one to do when one has a Claim Jumper gift card to use and the local Claim Jumper closes down? Bring the gift card Vegas!  That's exactly what happened to me and what I did. Someone gave a Claim gift card as a gift awhile back but I never got to use it. When the one near me closed down, I didn't really want to drive a long way to another one. When my trip to Vegas came around, I remembered a Claim Jumper that I'd always drive by on previous trips and I decided to bring my gift card with me.  We went to Claim Jumper on a Saturday night and this place was packed! We didn't have to wait for a table however and our menus were presented to us right away. I got the gold rush chicken dish which the waiter claimed was his absolute favorite. The other two in my party got the meatload and a pizza respectively.   Like other yelpers mentioned, the wait time for the food to come out was long! The waiter came by twice to apologize and tell us the food would be on it's way. We were all pretty hungry by the time the dishes came out.  It was a good thing though that we were hungry because the portion sizes are huge! Both the meatloaf and the gold rush chicken dishes had two pieces of their respective meats. These dishes also came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.   The gold rush chicken dish was good. The chicken was tender and flavorful with the melted cheese on top and it well with the oh so soft mashed potatoes! I loved the grilled vegetables! It had a good mix of eggplant, carrots, zucchini and squash! Yum! I got to try a little bit of the meatloaf and this was also good. The meatloaf had a tomato like flavor to it.  The dishes were so big that we had leftovers that lasted for two more meals! (Another's day's lunch and dinner). It was that much food! Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but the giant motherload chocolate cake that we saw upfront looked absolutely delicious! Hmm maybe next time ;)?",

Right there I thought we were headed for a great dining experience...  At 7:15, we still didn't have our food.  Our food was served to the table next to us.  When our food did come, my girl's meal did not have one thing correct on it.    Her order:  Steak & Shrimp, baked potato, extra shrimp (steak well done and all fried shrimp).  Here is what she got:  Steak (medium), vegetables and grilled shrimp (just one skewer)  Sent her food back while mine Sat on the table getting cold.  Told it would be fixed quickly.  20 minutes later she was brought back a plate with a Steak (labeled medium), mashed potatoes, and no shrimp.  We were told the shrimp would be out shortly.  See above.  Still not close but I guess getting closer.  My girl and I just looked at each other and we were done.  As the waiter, why would you not check your ticket before even bringing this plate to our table???  I had had enough.  Told the waiter we were leaving and would not be paying.  He tried to argue because there had been a Coronarita and shot of tequila ordered from the bar and he would have to talk to a manager.  I told him don't bother since he obviously was in the weeds and I would find a manager on my way out.  Found the manager and told him the issues we had and were not paying for anything.  We were told they were sorry, don't worry about the bill and please come back another time and look for him so he could make sure everything was done right. My girl and I agreed we will never be back.",

NO WAIT!!  - awesome  Male waiter comes to our table and introduces himself. He does not look enthused or have a cheery attitude. Pretty much just there to do his job. How you gonna get your tips with such a poor attitude?   We had to ask for refills. SERVICE - lame  Foods ordered:  *medium steak tips - was not cooked medium, more like medium well. As if the food sat on the plate too long waiting to be served.  *traditional calzone, served with spaghetti sauce?!  cmon guys, no marinara? - wack  This place seems like a nice place...it's really large and spacious. They have a LOT of menu options. If the food quality was better then I'd probably come here more often but this is one of those places that you'll just try once and decide it's not really worth it to go back.  womp womp womppp",

Years ago they used to offer California rolls and that was my favorite;  wish that would return.   I love the menu variety,  the service is friendly and they work pretty efficiently and fast.   Once in a while service is slow,  but it's when the restaurant is full and not fully staffed; they do the best they can.  The Landrys  reward club is worth the initial cost,  as you get it back in credit towards food.  The decor is nice and the bar area is set off from the large dining room.",

    "text": "Took the family here for a late lunch on Monday.  Got there at about 3:30 and were one of only a handful of people in the restaurant.  David was our waiter and gave us great service, very pleasant and very attentive to our needs, making recommendations from their extensive menu.  We decided on a Widow Maker burger, a Veggie Pizza and a BBQ burger.  All of us were very happy with our food, and really want to compliment David on his superb service.  Unfortunately, they don't have my favorite tea, Raspberry, so I have to take a point off for that. (Haha)  If you've never seen their humungus chocolate cake, you have to stop by if for no other reason.  This was not our first time at Claim Jumper, so my daughter, a real chocolate fan, knew what it was.  To my surprise, she didn't order a piece this time, maybe because it took her nearly a week to finish it last time.  Too funny!  Great place to eat, and the only thing I didn't care for was the music which was more than a bit loud for the number of guests.  It made conversation a little difficult.  But the food gets a 5 out of 5.  Defenately recommend the Claim Jumper",

I was a bit picky tonight as to what I wanted. I asked our server, Stephen, what he preferred between the bread bowl and the burgers. He insisted the widow maker was worth it. I almost changed my order after seeing the bread bowl but he reassured me the burger was going to be fantastic. He did not lie! It was huge! I couldn't even take a bite!   The staff was super friendly. Every time Stephen walked past our table he asked if we needed anything. You just don't find service like that anymore!

Not a good place for a diet, but sometimes I just want a big plate of tasty \"I Don't give a F\" dinner. Hopefully fried!  The interior feels like you are in Tahoe to me. It has that rustic, expansive feel to it. The service has been completely fine both times. Very efficient, and on point. Not necessarily that friendly, but that is OK. I am not there to make friends.   Would I go back, probably. The fact that I can walk to it from my house is part of that probability. Would I drive across town for it...doubtful.",

I dont remember if we ever had cool bread.  Butter on request. I think i like my bread warm at the very least.  The appetizers of fried zucchini, onion rings and calamari were great.  The entrees not so much.  The ribeye was cooked fine but the dollop of butter on it just made it greasy.  The grilled vegetables were cold.  The shrimp fresca pasta was just okay.  The description showed spinach, tomatoes and light butter.  The butter was overloaded and pooled at the bottom.  There was no spinach or tomatoes to be found.  The parmesan was a bit much.  We left a little more than half because the greasy taste of the pasta was overwhelming.   The asian chicken salad was drenched in dressing which is my fault.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side.  The biggest turn off was my lettuce.  When i was mixing it there were large pieces of the \"stem\" that was wilted.  As i started sifting through the salad i found more wilted pieces of lettuce.  I left 3/4 of the salad.  We did not bring any of it home.  Although it was Mother's Day it was not that busy as we were there at the opening.  I was really disappointed as i looked forward to eating here.  I joined the Loandry Club for that reason.  Im not sure when we will be back.",

The strawberry lemonade was 4.19.(really? Not even any alcohol!)  What we were happy with was the kids meal, cost 7.49 included drink and side. The warm cheesy bread they give you before the meal was amazing, and the server the good, atmosphere was good.

Needless to say, I was never able to get a water for my wife to take her vitamins.   A few words of advice: Never complain to the customer about what is stressing you out.

We had heard rumors in the entryway that they were out of turkey, so we asked our waiter, who checked with the kitchen, came back and assured us there was turkey. He took our our order, then came back 30 minutes later to tell us that no, the turkey was indeed all gone. One of our party just decided not to eat at all as he had his heart set on a traditional dinner. It took another hour for us to get our food. 3 hours for the whole experience.  I had the ham, it was so so, the stuffing was inedible, very unsatisfying except for the company.  DO NOT GO HERE ON HOLIDAYS!

I on the other hand was looking for something lighter so I chose the American Grilled Cheese. Unfortunately that was a terrible decision. The sand which tasted as it had be marinated in a vat of oil. Like it was dripping from it, a couple of bites and I couldn't eat anymore. The fries were good though. We let our server know, and he apologized and made it right. I greatly appreciated his attention to that. We decided to take desert home for later. We ordered a slice of the death by chocolate cake and a slice of cheese cake. The chocolate cake was wonderful, but the cheese cake was pretty disgusting. It was almost if the batter was not properly mixed and it didn't bake enough or maybe too much. It didn't have that smooth sweet texture of a cheese cake, rather it was kind of congealed in spots and very gritty in others. I tried two small bites, and had to throw the rest out. I wish we had tried to stay and desert there so I could have brought it to someone's attention. Unfortunately, what was supposed to be a good night with good friends and good food only partially came through. I do want to thank our server, and the manager on shift. They did apologize about the other things, but we didn't have any idea about the cheese cakes until we had already left. I really hope you guys can get your kitchen issues fixed before my next trip. Thank you",

    "text": "Went here the other night with my fiance for dinner. We were both starving and it was the closest place to eat. Our waiter was super awesome and attentive, but the food was...just mediocre. I got the Absolut Tortellini and my fiance got the BBQ Burger. I asked for mine without the bacon and the chicken because I've never like the combination of meat in my pasta. He told me he could take the bacon pieces out, but the sauce was cooked with bacon grease. I still decided to give it a try, which was a mistake. I am okay with eating bacon and bacon flavor (I'm not a vegetarian or vegan) but it just did not go well with the meal. I don't know if eating it with the chicken would have made it better, but after a few bites I had to stop because the grease was just so thick and outweighed the taste of everything else on the dish. Not to mention, it was $17.99 and I felt that for such a high priced pasta it should have tasted better.  I would be willing to eat here again, but I will probably pick something safer to try - something that can't be messed up.",

    "text": "Mom in law and Grandma wanted to eat here so we took them for dinner.   There is one upside for Claim Jumper than I liked- their small but fresh salad bar. This location didn't have one! I was so sad since that's usually what I want to get.   I got a curried cashew chicken sandwich- it was okay....it barely had any curry flavor to really call it curried. The bread had good taste with sundried tomato on it, but they didn't toast the bread so it was just kinda a chewy consistency. Shoe string fries is alright.  I've had this sandwich before. My mom ordered me one to-go a long time ago and it was way  better. I think the California ones are somehow a bit better with the food.  BF got chicken fried steak (small portion)- it was pretty good as fas as CFK goes at a chain or at a bar. I still have yet to find the \"best\" in Vegas.   Mom and grandma got chopped steak and said they really liked it. I didn't try a bite.   For dessert I saw they had sticky toffee pudding- they were in the mini bites so we ordered two. Seriously, the one good dessert they have is like a small offering.  Grandma never eats dessert but she ate a whole one herself and the BF and I shared one. Its good as far as sticky toffee goes.   Service was friendly, but the service wasn't too quick and then the kitchen was very slow. Considering we were coming on old peoples dinner time at 5, it wasn't very busy for them. We waited like 15 minutes to order and maybe 30 for our food and this isn't a place I would say is \"worth the wait\" so I would be cranky without sticky toffee pudding.   This place is alright.  If the mom and grandma isn't asking to go, I don't see myself really coming to eat dinner here without the salad bar.",

We shared a calamari which was good, and I ordered their korean chicken pizza.  I took 1 bite and didn't like it at all.  To be honest it's not that it was made wrong or anything like that, I just didn't care for it.  The server was nice and took it away and the manager stopped by to inquire and I simply told her I just didn't care for it and it was removed from the check.   Lunch was completely dead in here and it didn't surprise me.   I also found it dis respectful (since I'm a restaurant manager myself) to have a server LOUDLY say in the middle of an empty dining room \"I can't take that table\"",

Since they don't have one in Miami (although they have plenty of other great food in Miami) I figured I'd let my sweetie check it out.   Although we were kinda lame soup and salad for her and California chicken salad for me she was digging the vibe and we really enjoyed the Claim Jumper Mai Tai. Word to the wise it is meant for sharing because it is huge.   We had a new server in training who did an awesome job!

And the chicken, bacon, eggs, and blue cheese were fine, but the lettuce was completely frozen.  It was transparent and was freezing.  I don't know who prepared it, but it had to be their first day.  Any trained restaurant person knows what frozen lettuce looks and feels like.  Not to mention, the menu needed to be cleaned.  it was very sticky.  Wasn't a fan of the limited beer selection.  The bartender was nice.  Luckily, they did not charge me for the salad, just the beer.  Based on this experience, it will be awhile before I return to Claim Jumper.  Very disappointing.",

Our waitress Nina, however was far more interested in talking to the guys at the table next to us than serving us. We ordered 3 appetizers and they were all delivered by someone else thankfully. We ordered a second round of cocktails, but was able to get them from another server before Nina returned to say she was going to put in the order for us. The food was all decent. I got the ribs since I was in the mood for them, and they didn't disappoint. It was painful waiting 20+ minutes for our check as we watched our waitress flirting 5 feet away.

I could eat their chicken Caesar salad anytime of day, along with the country fried steak, mini corn dogs, BBQ burger, & a lot more.

Server took drink order. Came back and immediately wanted to take our order. Salads came fairly quickly. That was the end of the prompt service. Finally all 4 orders came out. Steak was overcooked and dry, ribs undercooked and cold, meatloafs were cold. Server took everything back and manager came over to apologize and said he would bring orders out. This time steak was properly cooked, ribs and meatloaf dinners were microwaved. When the manager came back I told him about microwaving. He said the meal were remade. When I asked him why my meatloaf was missing a bite that I had eat the 1st time. He just turned and walked away. We did the same thing. I left money to cover the drinks. I doubt I'll ever return even if others want to eat here. As we were leaving an employee at the front door told us that they had just revised the menu and recipes a few months ago. That's why it wasn't busy on a Friday evening. I cannot recommend Claim Jumper. There a a lot better places to eat in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I come here specifically for there filet mignon and also that it is close to my side of town versus the far better tasting claim jumper in townsquare (in my opinion the claim jumper in town square has much better cooked food) why is that? It's probably because townsquare businesses have to pay much more to be established in townsquare brand. Ok now let's get to the food at this location. Sometimes it is hit or miss but great if you have a lundry's reward card and want a quick casual meal to rank up points but save your points to splurge at the town square claim jumper or McCormick & Schmick's if you want to have a big party and claim your points. The servers at this location are actually really nice and do accommodate your needs as long as you speak up half way with out finishing the whole meal. If you order filet mignon make sure you specify how pink you like the center because there medium tends to overcook the filet and at that point it's pointless to eat. Unless that's your preference. The pretzel sticks as an appetizer are amazing and leave you in carbohydrate bliss. The deserts are large portioned and pre-made. Good family restaurant with good rewards and service if you speak up and specify how you want it cooked rather assume it can all be perfect. To each there own.",

The service needs a huge revamp and better quality! When I called I requested 6:00 pm, the girl on the phone said please hold, I held for 10 minutes, she then comes back on the phone and says \"Thank you for calling Claim Jumpers, how may I help you\", so I am guessing it's a new girl on the phone when I find out later it's the same one, then as she was making the reservation she kept talking to someone in the back not acknowledging me at all on the phone, then she disconnects the call, so again giving the benefit of the doubt of maybe it was my cell, I try calling back and guess what no answer I tried from 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm and no answer, so I decided to take my business else where.",

She was guessing at her description of some of the menu items, luckily, we still enjoyed them, but they were not in any way they way that she described their taste.  The mudd pie dessert had a piece of wax paper or cardboard in it still, which was discovered after chewing on it... gross. We set it aside to show her, and she didn't have anything more to say, than \"oh sorry!\" and walked away with the plate. I would have expected a visit from the manager, and removal of the dessert from the check. It is not our fault as the customer, that the prep crew did a shoddy job with our dessert.  I wasn't impressed. The wedge salad also is no longer on the menu, which is a favorite. After wards she explained that it was removed because of a \"lettuce shortage\" and was still available by request. HUH??  And by the way... why not make a chicken pot pie without MUSHROOMS?",

My boyfriend opted for grilled chicken on his ...I was able to get my chicken like crispy chicken strips but cut into small pieces on my salad . It was sooo good !!! The cheesy Parmesan bread they give you while waiting for your food is addicting. We ate a lot of it -The salads were huge we actually could have just shared one salad . It's family size portions ... We managed to save room for dessert we chose the salted caramel mud pie ...It was recommended by our waiter. We were torn between that and the brownie but went with the pie. It was enormous we couldn't even finish it. They really gave us a huge slice. We will definitely be back . You get your money's worth come (come hungry) and be prepared to pig out and take left overs home. Our waiters were super friendly and helpful . We didn't have to ask for water or extra silverware they were on it. I love The ambiance really nice and the booth was nice and roomy big small we could have fit another couple in the booth with us that's how big it is.",

The hostess was a little less than friendly. She was wearing a headset and not speaking to anyone. When we asked a question, she raised her hand in a stopping motion and made us wait.

Now the appetizers are amazing here I recommend the appetizer platter, the candied bacon, and the zucchini. The platter has all the delicious appetizer menu items and it is amazing. I love the artichoke dip. But be careful because this platter will definitely get you full. The servers are very quick and friendly. I definitely recommend the Widowmaker Burger and the chicken pot pie. If you still have room for dessert, you will not be disappointed. A huge layer chocolate cake is amazing.

I felt like the meal was decent enough to feed 4-6 people. We actually had other items that we made ourselves so this meal wasn't demolished. Overall it was easy to pick up, heat up and serve. Everything was labeled so there was no mistaking that. The turkey was moist and still tasty! The ordering process was easy and it helped us not spend as much time in the kitchen!  Overall I believe that it was worth it especially if you have tiny kids and rather spend that time playing with them or watching football. Everyone was pleased with the sides and I will definitely think about using them again for another big holiday meal.",

I got a small Caesar salad, coconut shrimp, 2 grilled fish tacos & water. Delicious!!! Our server was so kind and sincere I couldn't help but ask him for his name so I could tell the manager what a great job he was doing.  Then I thought, better yet, I'm going to write a short yelp review. Our servers name is Stephen Shinogle.  If you ever get a chance to go to claim Jumper for happy hour, you might get lucky and have Steven for your waiter!  Thank you Stephen & we will be back!",

I had the clam chowder for starters and the garlic cheese bread, which was the best bread I've tasted from a restaurant in a while.   For dinner I had the Pasta dish with Parmesan shrimp and pasta and it was amazing. Although, I was almost full from the chowder, I couldn't stop eating the pasta. I was so full and had enough food for another meal the following day. My mother ate the pot pie and it was stuffed all the way to the top (not full of air), and the crust was delicious.  I even snuck a bite of the meatloaf our friend ordered and the flavors were great! The beef and pork mixture really rocks. Only thing I didn't try was the famous chocolate cake which is massive! But I'll be making a special trip back just to try that Food Network worthy dessert!   Great service, awesome staff, will be returning.",

At 2:30 pm it was practically deserted but when we asked for a table the hostess requested \"that we give her ten to fifteen minutes \". This prompted the question in my mind \"why \". After a few minutes waiting I went to get a menu so as to know what to order. As I approached the hostess stand the hostess started walking away towards the kitchen, I called for her attention but a normal conversational voice wasn't sufficient to break through her preoccupation. We left shortly thereafter. The lack of attention demonstrated by the hostess didn't bode well for a good meal. There's too many restaurants in this town that seem to want our business to bother with this one.",

Over all the restaurant was clean and orderly. Menu is extensive and there is definitely something for everyone. Prices are a bit high for a neighborhood restaurant with the average dinner meal costing $18-$20. Appetisers we $10+ each as well  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad for $16.00. Folks - it was huge (see picture) !! I'm talking two people could easily share this. My daughter had a kids Mini Corn Dogs which she claimed were \"amazing\". We considered the enormous slice of cake for desert, but for $12 I decided to stop at Smith's on my way home and buy myself a whole cake!!!    The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the issue I had was that our napkins. They were still slightly soiled even tho we could tell they have been laundered. We unrolled all 4 sets. All had small flecks of dried food left clinging to the fabric. Nothing to do with the restaurant - just something that the person rolling the forks didn't catch. Over all good experience for a slightly fancier chain restaurant.",

The chicken tenders are so juicy and big, the French fries are absolutely deliciously seasoned and the Apple Crumble Cheesecake is to die for! Large chunks of glazed apple with a graham cracker topping and crust really brings the entire cheesecake together and it's a different interpretation of the traditional Ny Cheesecake.   The French onion soup is also highly recommended, every time I go I always have to get that soup.  The service has always been very good and servers have always been kind.",

I love the location and the ambiance is so comforting!       Tonight, we decided for dinner to order through a third party delivery service. We placed our order for: A Classic cheeseburger (with fries) for $12.95, Country fried steak with mashed potatoes (with extra sauce) and a small caesar salad ($18.89), a side of mashed potatoes ($4.99) with special instructions, three cheese potatocakes ($10.49) with extra sauce, the chicken pot pie with a side of fruit and a cup of claim chowder ($17.84), crab cakes ($16.79), and, finally, a side of cheesy garlic bread ($1.24). Phew, it was a lot of food, but we had an awesome coupon so we were really excited to get a big order.      Due to adding some extra comments for a few items I called the restaurant about 5 minutes after the order was placed, 8:55 PM, only because in the past (not this restaurant, but others) the comments had been ignored. The guy who answered and was very nice. He noted he had seen the notes for extra sauces and that we wanted to substitute the extra side of mashed potatoes with macaroni and cheese (the third parties website didn't have an option to add an individual macaroni and cheese) and he already was on it! Super cool! I was impressed and we ended the phone call on a positive note saying that the food should be done and ready in about 10 minutes.      Now, on the third parties site you can track your order. So, around 9:50 PM I checked the track your order option for the third time and the timing on the delivery had changed for the THIRD time to after 10:20 PM. Yikes, so that would mean the food would have been sitting around for over an hour! Since it was past 9:30 PM the restaurant themselves had already closed so I called the third party to inquire. The customer service rep called  the driver and they said they had picked up the food and were about 10 mins away. Super frustrating, but what are you going to do.       Our food arrived at 10:15 PM and the driver told the BF that he had to wait a little bit longer for the food because they started making it when he got there. Now, I don't know if he was just saying that because the wait was sooooo long, or that it actually happened. But the food was VERY fresh and I've had food arrive from late third party services and you can absolutely tell it's been sitting around. Regardless, we were really happy with the food and if they remade the food because of the super long wait then high five to Claim Jumper. They definitely have my returning business.",

After waiting over 30 minutes, I checked on our table and was told if the manager approved, we'd be next, about 10-15 minutes. When I replied that's what we had been told when we arrived, the hostess said the manager had put a 30 minute hold on seating.

Spinach dip however didn't really have any flavor. I think it is a little pricey for the quality of the food.

Definitely one of my favorite places to have Chinese Chicken Salad ($10.95 lighter portion/ $13.75 full size portion)- it's so good, I probably order that the most. I've had other dishes here too, like the turkey sandwich, a side of thai slaw (yum!), the starter salad/soup lunch combo (satisfying) for $7.95, comes with garlic cheese toast. My husband likes the meatloaf and mashed potatoes at $13.95. The chocolate cake is legendary (this coming from someone who is not even a chocolate fan- my hubby's the chocoholic). The serving sizes are really big, BTW. If I could compare it to another chain restaurant, maybe it comes close/similar to the Cheesecake Factory.   Happy Hour: monday- friday, from 3-7, in the saloon only.  The decor is dark, rich woods- kind of feels like an upscale rustic cabin. The service is really good, too. More locations in town like the one at Town Square and the one at 215 & Green Valley Parkway.",

My advise is to go on traditionally slower days so you don't get the bum's rush and the pressure to order your meal, appetizers and drinks all 60 seconds after you sit. I understand they need to turn the tables to turn a bigger profit but it won't put them out of business if they come back a second time for my order. The food just like the service is all over the place from blood still flowing in my chicken to a nice crispy skin well cooked meal. If there was one thing they could do better it would be to improve on their consistency and hopefully to the higher standard. Again this place can be a good experience but it really is a roll of the dice, so go when they aren't overly busy.",

Mind you, I'm here with one other person. We didn't even order appetizers.   The steak was cold when I finally got it but I didn't dare say a word as it's taken over an hour to get two steaks. Their broccoli was 3.75 extra and was so crunchy it's hard to tell if it was even steamed. Our total for two iced teas, two steaks and two salads came to 53.73 which would have been fine IF I wasn't watching now a 4th table leaving that came after us. What's even worse is a manager came over to let us know their was a backup in the kitchen, yet I've timed it and no one had waited as long as us.   Here it is 549 and we are still waiting for him to come pick up our card so I'm going to pay upfront ... Because apparently he's never coming back   NEVER COMING BACK!!",

First off, THIS IS A CHAIN. After James(our server) took our drink and appetizer order we thought this was going to be a good night out.  Our bad. We got the Onion Rings based on a Yelp review.  They were standard. James took our entree order and the wait began.  After 25 minutes he apologized for the order not coming out. After 30 minutes he apologized again. Minutes later the meals came out. My wife had the Absolute Tortellini. It was OK, nothing special. I had the Fish Taco. Stone cold.  This was fried fish, stone cold. Like they took it out of the refrigerator. This place uses runners.  The meal was probably done and no runner brought it to the table, but the server and kitchen staff didn't ensure the meal was right before it came out. I complained to James and he told the manager. The result was comped meals and a desert, which I hate them giving me a desert. I don't eat desert usually. I want an explanation of why they F**ked it up. That lets me know you identified the problem and maybe your will correct it. I should know better than to eat at a chain.  As a gypsy I sometimes forget that the reviews of Yelp locals may be jaded.",

    "text": "We used to come to Claim Jumper a lot, but stopped because most of the food is just too rich.  But this time I was here with a group of friends for Happy Hour, and it was a great experience.  The bar is a really cozy and rustic spot, and our table was right in front of the fireplace, which kept me nice and toasty.  Contrast that with all the other restaurants in town that blast the air conditioning when the temp is 45 degrees outside and you have to sit bundled up while you eat.  Kudos for that!  None of us was very hungry, so the HH menu fit the bill perfectly.  I ordered a Long Island Iced tea, and when the waiter brought it, I thought \"uh-oh.\"  It was as pale as could be and looked like a glass of water.  But when I tasted it I was shocked at how strong - and good - it was, and for 4 bucks!  I shared chicken Street Tacos with one friend.  They were really small; the chicken was a bit dry, but with the stuff they put on top of it, it was really fine, and for $3, I really can't complain.  I tasted my friend's ceviche, and it was delicious.  I also shared Calamari with another friend.  They were really good, and not drowning in breading, but they were so tender I wonder if they were really calamari?  A very small portion, but again, HH prices.  Also shared a black bean hummus with chips for $2, and that was the only thing that was absolutely skipable.  Too bad it wasn't just ordinary hummus.  One of our group ordered just a drink and didn't eat anything, so our bill was very small.  Despite that, the server was terrific, and never once hinted that we weren't worth his time.  I think his name was Niles, and he was a gem.  We left a very nice tip to make up for our paltry bill.  And we vowed that our next Happy Hour will be right back at Claim Jumper.",

They might as well shut the doors now, most of the favorites are no longer available, not even on the \"secret menu\" the waitress said.   Truly a shame. Only 7:30pm and the place was empty. I guess our waitress was so bored, she was yawning as she took our order. The kitchen staffing have been falling asleep too..one of the entrees was cold as were the appetizer chicken wings.",

When I got home and opened the box, it was a big dry chocolate muffin with 1 tbsp of frosting in a small to go cup. Not even enough for a bite.  Soooo disappointed as again, this was to be my one sweet treat until my next birthday. When I called to complain, I was told that is how we make our brownies now...in a small bundt cupcake pan.   OMG... it didn't even taste like a brownie as dry & crumbly.  Fool me once but fair warning to those of you who remember the big square double frosted brownies CJ USED to make!!!!",

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE FOR THANKSGIVING!!! My family made reservations about 6-8 weeks in advance to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner for 10 of us. When we arrived it was absolute CHAOS! We still had to wait 45 minutes for our table and THEY RAN OUT OF TURKEY DINNERS! The poor servers were trying their hardest not to absolutely loose their minds but the panic was very evident. The manager was literally RUNNING from tables to the kitchen and back. Absolutely nothing was offered to compensate us for running out of turkey. (Note to the chef- make extra next year based on the number of reservations and tons of walkins and if you end up with extra run a turkey sandwich special for a few days after.) It took another 45 minutes to get our drinks and while the food we were able tasted ok it was apparent the entire restaurant was going down in flames. Some of our dishes had vegetables on it & some didn't (same dish ordered) & some of our dishes had mashed potatoes and some didn't (same dish ordered). The absolute worst part was right after we got our drinks they sat a table that was at least 25-30 people in the private dining room next to us. The night was an absolute disaster & I would NEVER recommend going there on a special occasion ever again. Corporate should really train the managers how to maintain their reservations and communicate those numbers with the chef to order enough food. Wouldn't you rather serve 500 happy guests than 1000 pissed off people?! Never again.",

After receiving our drinks and before ordering our food I presented the coupon to the server. Not three minutes after ordering our food my entree was brought out. Before the salads. After about 15 minutes and several times of the server passing by and saying that my husband's food and my 2 kids' food is on it's way out as well, my husband asked her if my food had maybe been from someone else's order, to which she denied. I called bullshit. My husband called bullshit. There is no way that my salmon entree could have been cooked in that short amount of time. We decided to leave, canceled the food, and requested the check for our drinks. Beyond gross trying to reserve food. I should call the health department.",

Over the years the menu has changed and portions have gotten a bit smaller but will still fill the biggest appetites.   They do a lot of things really well, giant deserts, great soups (I love their claim chowder, its better than any I've had in San Francisco on the Wharf), great tri-tip, and most other dishes are very good too.  I think its fair to compare them to a Cheese Cake Factory but with a slightly smaller menu. If you like Cheese Cake factory meals you'll probably like Claim Jumper.  Of caorse Claim Jumper has a western mining theme but they play it down more today and present more like a moderate stake house than the mining theme.  I ordered their version of a pasta Cajon dish that had just enough heat, plenty of shrimp, chicken, and andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers and of coarse pasta.  Everyone seemed satified with the items they had and several of us had leftovers to take home or ordered deserts to go.",

Hardly any wait, and the restaurant is very big, I loved the fact that we were able to have a nice cozy corner booth without feeling like we were sitting on top of anyone. Our server was nice very informative, I must add if you have not been in the last three months, the menu is very condensed, and a lot smaller than the original.   The bread is so delicious, it's like garlic with cheese very good! I ordered the clam chowder to start, and my boyfriend the chicken tortilla. Both were just ok nothing to rave about. His hardly had any chicken, and both of our soups were super thick. Definitely would skip out on the soups next time.   For our dinner we ordered the chicken pot pie, steak with a loaded baked potatoes, & sauteed veggies. For our daughter we kept it simple chicken fingers and fries. She was happy with her meal.   All the the food was very fresh, and hot when it arrived to the table. As for my steak it was fine, cooked well, my only issue was the veggies were super salty. Something minor but didn't have a fresh taste, and that's what I was more leaning towards. The prices are reasonable, don't worry even if your on a tight budget you can still find something satisfying to order.   I would defiantly pay another visit to claim jumper.",

I had their California citrus salad which has all the things I love, mandarin oranges, cranberries, green apples, candied pecans,  avocado and blue cheese. However the lettuce and mandarin orange were limpy so wasn't as great as I expected.   The Drunk Chicken was excellent, grilled chicken breast served on than amazing bacon vodka tomato cream sauce and potatocakes. I think I stole all the potato cakes from my husband's entree! The potato cheddar soup is good.   We were so full that didn't get a chance to try dessert. The restaurant inside is quite dated and needs some serious upgrade. We were initially seated on a table with ripped seat, our hostess was kind enough to change the table immediately.",

We have always enjoyed the food and the staff!! Waiter took our order and then when we got the sampler the wings were wrong. After a while I asked if they were Asian BBQ and he said \"oh I saw they were wrong I should have fixed it...\" best part- \" would you like me to get the Asian BBQ sauce to dip it in\" uh no they have buffalo sauce on them and we don't like buffalo sauce. Not sure how that fixed the problem. Then we had ordered cake and was asked would you like that to come out with your food or after. After please. Ok no problem. Finish eating and sitting there waiting when waiter comes back with everyone's bills... hey just checking on the cake. \"Oh I was going to tell you but forgot that when I went back in to get it the chef has already put everything away for the night.\" So when were you going to tell us? Because we had to bring up both mistakes. I get it a big group late at night and I have never seen him before so must be new but communicate with us and I would have been cool and understanding. Ask to speak to the manager and he comes over and his comment \"what would you like me to do to fix it\" well sit there is nothing you can do because the order was wrong and your waiter needs to communicate better. Watch as he goes to discount our ticket for the messed up wings and watch as he is laughing with the waiter at the register. Then we get our receipt and it says we didn't like the taste... uh no the waiter and the cook made a mistake! Its not about us not liking the taste of it because i didn't taste it! It's about customer service and the lack of!",

We speak to the hostess and tell her we have a reservation for two. She looks it up...and there is no record of a reservation. That was the first warning. She told us not to worry and that we would be moved to the top of the list and invited us to take a seat. After about twenty minutes of waiting we approached her again to which she replied, \"How can I help you today?\" She had no recollection of our previous conversation. We reminded her but she looked at us blankly. We asked how many people were in front of us because at this point we were fed up. She told us we were third on the list...so what she told us earlier was a blatant lie.   Once we were finally seated the waiter we had was great. He forgot to get us something we asked for but his kindness made up for it. However, the table we were seated at was like a see-saw. A little weight on one side and it would lean in that direction with a thump.   The food was okay at best. Bland and overpriced.  Overall, even with the kind waiter, I won't be eating at this or any other Claim Jumper again. The only reason we stayed was due to the fact it was Valentine's Day and it would be a nightmare to find another place at that hour.   The experience was ruined right off the bat by the hostess and nothing could really make up for lying to our faces.",

Made a reservation for 630 pm for 4 adults and a child.   Walked in was seated right away, with a really sweet waitress. She offered my daughter apple juice and a booster or high hair. For the first time ever we chose the booster (dun dun dun) and it surprisingly worked out.   We ordered an app, fried calamari, which was a small sized portion and came with a side of asian peanut salad. I wasn't a fan and it didnt seem to pair well with fried calamari.   I asked if they still had the salad bar, which i was a huge fan of but nope they discontinued that. BUMMER! That was one of the main reasons why we came.  I ordered the tri tip dip, which has caramelized onions, roasted peppers and monterey jack cheese. Hold the au jus please, and add a side of ranch. YUM. It came with string fries. Pure perfection. Probably the best dip I've had (except in CA where the dip was invented in downtown LA)  Husband got a bacon burger with fries. They majorly messed it up. he asked for the meat to be well done and instead it was medium rare. He still ate it after I told him to return it, he doesnt like to return food. he swears cooks will spit in it (As i roll my eyes). he said it was okay, nothing special and he wouldnt order it again. he told me he wished he had ordered my dip.   Our guests both got pasta dishes. They liked them and got sides of the soup. I noticed the soups were tiny little soups and the pasta dishes were half the size that they used to be.  My daughter got the kids meal, which was mac n cheese, oranges and french fries. it was huge! No wonder kids are obese now adays. She ate half of the mac n cheese and a couple fries and was full. It was good though because now she had a meal for the next day :) She loved it, them again she will eat any pasta thats smothered in cheese.   Our food took about 25 minutes to arrive, not bad for a super busy friday night.",

    "text": "Not sure how many stars to give, so I went in the middle.  Five stars for how good the BBQ Chicken Salad & warm bread was.  ONE STAR for the manager of this restaurant today and the clueless server.  The waitress seemed to be confused about it being a free meal for Veteran's and said \"they just threw this thing together.\"  Um, no we go every year.  Then she takes my husband's driver's license that has VETERAN written on it and takes it to the manager, she is gone a long while.  She comes back and says \"we need more proof.\"  Not only does my husband have a Veteran License (that you have to really jump through hoops for in Nevada to get it), he has his Military ID in his wallet, wearing a Marine Corp ring, hat.  Then to question him.  She said \"we get a lot of people in here trying to get a free meal.\"  I said well we aren't one of those people and here's our proof.  Then the manager comes to our table and doesn't believe my husband's ID nor Military card, I honestly think he didn't even know what one looked like.  That about sent my usually calm husband into a rage.  I said, I am so offended right now.  Are you going to check all of the women and men's ID's that served or are serving our country's DD214's?  He said, yes I am.  (ya right)  I'm pretty sure some of them aren't carrying those around in their wallet.  I know I sound like I'm throwing up all over this post, it was just so sad how my husband was treated and to be kind of referred to as a liar.  Showing his ID should have been all they needed to see, but no, they took it to ridiculous levels.  Really?  Shame on you guys.",

    "text": "I have been to this particular Claim Jumper once every month or so for the past 7 years. The quality of service and food have gone down steadily during those years.  Visited last night (perhaps for the last time).  Arrived and the restaurant wasn't busy. Elderly couple was ahead of my family. They got seated immediately.  Hostess made us wait for a few minutes.  That's fine. Maybe they sent home wait staff early so they had to seat in one area. When we get seated, the elderly couple ahead of us was seated across from our booth. They had drinks and had ordered already.  By the time wait staff noticed us, the couple already started on their meals AND got refills. We were still without beverages and had one set of utensils.  Once the waitress got to us, drinks and food were delivered in a timely manner.  We ordered a cheeseburger, kids pasta, kids sliders, and a chicken fried steak. The food was satisfactory except for the steak. Mind you,  there is no half portion option for this dish anymore. Vegetables aren't included either. So I get this monochromatic mound of food on my plate with white gravy smothered all over. The steak covers the whole half of the plate, but as I cut into it, I discover the chicken fried part - the batter - was nearly 3/4 of the steak. The meat was probably hammered down to a 1/4 inch slab. After is I got down with the meat, my plate was still full but mostly of batter.  I get it. Got to make your cuts somewhere if the restaurant isn't performing. It is, egregious,  to charge me $15 for batter, though. So I left this place feeling swindled and neglected.",

If you like Cobb Salad and you haven't tried this sandwich you really really should!  Sometimes there can be a wait to get a table but well worth the wait! You can phone your order in for pick up too. The staff is always friendly. They have a rewards program you will for sure want to talk to your server about. It is free and rewards you for how much you spend and you can use it at multiple restaurants! I saw a thing on the table while I was eating mentioning that they offer catering even for breakfast. I hadn't thought of catering anything for the office but donuts so this was nice to find out haha.",

Although I do agree with another reviewer who states that the food has shrank a little bit its still way huge and you will most likely leave with a doggy bag!  There were a couple times Ive had to send my food back because it wasnt hot which is a big no-no for me. The plate wasnt even hot on one occasion so that should let them know that the food most definitely isnt warm. One suggestion I would make is that they learn to season their food a little better. While their pot pie is tasty and one of their most popular dishes I always need salt.. and Im not a huge salt adder .. Im always perplexed by this..",

To start, my kids wanted spinach dip and Arnold Palmers ( I'm a mean mom who rarely lets them drink soda). Arnold Palmers werent mixed well and had no ice.Too much dip and not enough chips.  Ugh... Maybe main course will make up for a rough start? Wrong. My chicken had no flavor other than it \"smelling\" like apples. Roasted veggies were greasy and all tasted the same. mashed potatoes had no flavor either.  My husband had flavorless tri-tip, but it was cooked medium like he asked, so maybe that's a plus?! My daughter asked for Mandarin oranges and the server forgot...twice.  My son had Alfredo. He loves mine better he says ::awwww ,blushing:: Overall, food greasy and flavorless, unless you order from the kids menu. Maybe, I'm just used to eating better, or maybe I was wrong to expect so much from a chain restaurant,but the food just didn't amaze me.",

I was in fact on my way to a pizza place, but we came here instead.  Need less to say I was in the mood for pizza.  I ordered the pepperoni and sausage and it wasn't good.  The biggest problem I had with it was the that the sausage was chopped into what I could only describe as bacon bits.  I wasn't too thrilled by it.  For me the appetizer was the highlight.  I will be back though, because I hear great things about the chocolate cake, and for the Mozzarella sticks.  Also considering there portions it wasn't pricey at all which is great.",

There were not enough seats in area so they said we had to sit in another section.  We asked if they could honor the happy hour prices and they said no.  They sat us at a table and we added for a high chair.  They said we had to move to a different table.  We moved.  The food took a long time to come.  The kids were starting to lose it.  We asked the waiter about food and he apologized saying there was a party of 60 slowing things down.  Again our waiter was nice but not an enable experience.  Should have gone to BJ s.

Once we arrived, we were told there would be a fifteen minute wait as the kitchen was very busy. This was OK and we sat down to wait. Once we got seated, our waiter (Sam I think) came to get our orders. He was really knowledgeable about the menu and had a friendly smile.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and a calzone and meatloaf as the entrees. He brought our drinks and some bread. The bread is a really great cheesy bread that is pretty good size. The calzone was HUGE, and really tasty. My partner said the meatloaf was great. I had ordered mushrooms with the calzone and they forgot them. The manager came over and personally apologized for the mistake and gave us a price break. That was really a good move. We will surely go back for the great food and good service.",

Even on Mother's Day I can understand it being even more busy then normal but our server was great! She always checked on us to see if everything was to our satisfaction and always was there to refill my water. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to if I am feeling to get my money's worth! It's hard to get 5 stars out of me but they definitely deserve it. If you want the loaded potato it is currently not on the menu for this location but if you just ask your waiter for it they can serve it. Outstanding all around. Will definitely come back.",

If you have a card you get  points on your card everytime you visit and on your birthday month you get money taken off your bill and a free desert. Their desserts are amazing.  We have not been to Claim Jumpers in a while so we decided it was time for us to visit. Has usual we have had great service. This time we had WOW AWESOME SERVICE.  Shawn was our server. We usually ask for Dominique but this time we did not ask for anyone specifically. They gave us Shawn I think we have had him as our server once before. Shawn knew us from a while ago so he knew what we always ordered from a long time ago. We was impressed. We always start out with the wings with a Lot of Bleu cheese dressing.  I really love their Bleu Cheese dressing. I wish they would sell it. We did not have to ask for extra blue cheese he already knew and he brought it out and he brought out ranch as well. The dinner we had the Ribs soooo Good fall of the bone good ribs.  Shawn brought out extra ranch for that. We like dipping our ribs in the ranch. Service was superb. We rarely had to ask for anything Shawn is really good at his job. Being a server for 30 years {Myself} back east Shawn is a dam good server. We will ask for him everytime from now on.   Thank  You Shawn",

Server was prompt with her routine spiel, mechanical and robotic, polite, but indifferent. Very accommodating adhering to specific requirements to the order and quick to bring additional requests to the table.  Entrees arrived by runner before even halfway through with salads. When stated we were still working on our salads he shrugged his shoulders, dropped the plates, and left.  Ordered the Ore Combo with baby backs, rotisserie chicken, and tri tip all were very good and nice size portions however, in my opinion the demi glaze on the tri tip was a fail and should of been served on the side. I mentioned to the server I did care for the sauce, she quickly apologized and just as quickly walked away. Also ordered a tri tip dip, that came out served on a galvanized metal chicken feed tray or something to that effect very tacky, but the sandwich was good.  When presenting the check the server also presented a high pressure sales pitch to join Landry's Select Club for only $25, her determination to close the deal ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing and stress free evening out.   Was charged for a lemon aid when I asked for a slice of lemon for my water. An unapologetic manager happily obliged and removed the lemon aid charge from the bill and then felt it necessary to assure me nothing shady was going on. Um...O.K. ?????  Not the best experience as far as a warm friendly, inviting, atmosphere goes. The service was adequate, but the hospitality felt aggressive, disingenuous, and forced at best. Less than welcoming.  However, the food that was ordered was good and the cooks seem to know what they're doing... take out orders might be the best way to go here.",

It's not bad for what it is: a junior Cheesecake Factory knockoff with a giant menu of massive portions of super-caloric food and laughably huge cake slices for dessert (for $11, natch).   SLIDERS were dry and overcooked, served with LTOP but no condiment sauces? Enjoyed the good-quality thick-cut cheddar, selected side of SPICY THAI SLAW which was actually really fresh and light. BF got the TRI TIP PLATE, meat was a bit tough but well seasoned with a tasty demi sauce, sided with nice roasted veggies and some dismal mashed potatoes. Added a large cup of the CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP, which was actually really flavorful!  Portions were huge, left stuffed. Service was friendly. Much like CF, menu doesn't really have a focus so it's hard to decide what to order.",

We got there at 5:30 PM on a Sunday so it was not busy at all, so I figured we would get a table fairly quickly since there were so many open ones. 15 minutes later we were finally seated. As we were being led to the table I saw that more than half of the tables were still empty and thought there was no reason to have kept us waiting up front.    Once seated, our drink order was taken right away, so I thought things would go better.  Unfortunately, I was wrong. The drinks came quickly, and our waiter took our food order promptly... so far, so good.  Our waiter then brought us a loaf of bread but no butter or anything to dip it in.  Another 20 minutes goes by and he finally comes by again just to let us know that our dinner would be coming out shortly and then promptly left before I could even ask for some butter for the bread which was now not even warm.  The food finally came to the table 10 minutes later. It was ok for a family restaurant so It was what I expected. My disappointment was in how long it took to seat us and how long it took to bring the dinner when the restaurant was not even busy.  Overall, it was just ok and would look at trying some of the other restaurants that are just minutes away from this one.",

    "text": "Claim Jumper is over priced comfort food. They do give huge portions, but I don't think that justifies the prices. I would never go here without a gift card. It just so happens my MIL gave us a gift card for Christmas, so off we went on New Year's Day for lunch.   It was not busy at all and we were seated within 5 minutes. We started with the onion rings as an appetizer. They came out super fast, but I soon found out why. They didn't fry them long enough so they were still partly raw. I didn't care for them but my boyfriend said they were okay so we just left it alone.  For our meals I ordered the chopped steak and he ordered the chicken friend steak with the potato cakes on the side. His meal came with a soup or salad and he chose the potato cheese soup. That soup was bomb. It had great flavor. Looking back at the menu, I realized I should have gotten a soup or salad with my meal also. Our server was off in lala land so it's no surprise she forgot.   Our food took a bit longer than expected. I was surprised since the half raw onion rings came out so fast. When the food finally came, it was good but nothing special. The chopped steak comes with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and grilled onions with a demi glace, but there was hardly any demi glace on my plate. It was really tasty, but I just wish there was more because most of my meal was dry. The cfs was okay also. My favorite part of his meal was the potato cakes. They have cheese inside they are freaking delicious. After all was said and done our bill was $51. Luckily our gift card was for $50. But see how ridiculous that is? $50 for 2 people for mediocre food and service? Not cool.  Yelp 2015 Review #4",

They offered to get me another entree and dropped off a menu then failed to come back for 10 minutes! They did take it off the check.

    "text": "Two friends and I decided last minute to try this place.  We walked in around 7PM and the restaurant was not busy. Even so, we weren't even greeted. After awkwardly standing around for 15 minutes waiting for the hostess, she finally wrote us down on her computer and told us it would be 15 minute wait to be seated. We sat in the lobby area about 20 minutes.  Finally seated our server seemed a little out of it. He had no energy.  We ordered two shrimp fresca pastas and tenderloin tips. We were given a plate of plain bread with no butter. So we asked for some butter, the server apparently forgot, and we had to ask a second time for butter.  After about 35 minutes of waiting our food came out. Unfortunately both dishes were not good.. The shrimp fresca pasta was overly greasy and too salty. The tenderloin tips were too chewy and must not have been prepared correctly because my friend ended up with an upset stomach that night.   We were not happy with the service we received. Wait time, service, and taste were all a disappointment.  It doesn't seem like any of the workers enjoyed working there, nobody smiled.  I will not be dining at Claim Jumpers ever again.",

I've been here about three times. As far as I know, the food has always been great and fresh during the day. It could be different at night. But I probably only been here once at night and still I had a great experience. Today, my server Dana, blonde, was a great server. We were sitting at the bar area so we can get a happy hour. She was very attentive and smiled. Her energy was just great. It was refreshing to know that Customer Service like that, still existed. Because the Las Vegas that I know, it lacks in that department all together. I look forward to going back there and dining again. I recommend this place and sitting in Dana's section.",

    "text": "Let me start this by saying i've been going to Claim Jumpers for over 10 years. I have always enjoyed my grilled chicken breast and skinny fries. Apparently corporate thought it smart to get rid of both items. Here's the issue. People love places like this because of what they like. Corporate comes in and changes everything to save a few bucks. It isn't going to work. Last night I dined at this location. Upon looking over the menu I noticed the grilled chicken was gone. I asked the waitress about it and she was very rude regarding this manner. She had given me a speech about how corporate changed the menu and anything that's not on there can't be served. I understood this wasn't her fault so I kindly asked if it was possible I order the kids chicken nuggets. She again very rudely responded that I could not order off the kids menu if i wasn't a kid or an 85 year old woman. I asked her to check with her manager because I have never in my life at any establishment been told I couldn't have a kids meal. I offered in fact to pay more for this meal. I ended up getting happy hour food that was all crap including their new thick fries which are disgusting. Between how a loyal customer was treated and the changes corporate has made this place will end up with all locations closed.",

Bread was made in house and melted in my mouth. Delicious!  The bf had the pot pie, also huge and thought it was delicious. They have a very large selection for lunch specials.

This was my first time at this location.  We had a big party of 11. Our server was very attentive & kind even though we kept asking for stuff. I love how my niece only ate the shredded carrots out of my sisters salad so our server brought her a good amount of shredded carrots she could eat off her own plate. Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I'm very picky when it comes to salt so I gave my food back & they replaced it with no problem. The manager came to apologize which was considerate. It wasn't bad I'm just not used to salt in my food.",

This place is huge, there is plenty of seating available which is good, I am sure this place gets packed.  Our server who was very much on top of things in spite of being busy with other customers. She took our orders; I got a calzone with spinach and mushrooms. It took a bit of time for our food to come out, again I think it's because they were busy.  Once we got our food, I dug in, my impression of the food was okay, just a bit bland for a calzone and sauce, but it wasn't bad just needed garlic.  Next time come back, I have a different entree.",

    "text": "After a short trip to the bowling alley, ended by an unexpected fundraiser, my kids were still craving nachos. One kid wanted a burger. So I thought, easy solution, Claim Jumper.  We headed in on a windy and quiet Saturday night. It was fairly empty, but kids were lured by unspoken promise of two foot tall cakes in display case. We were seated immediately, given menus. To our chagrin, they no longer serve nachos. And then burger kid didn't order a burger. That was lost immediately when the server brought a plate of fruit, cheese and crackers to the 20 month old when he was likely only 8 seconds away from complaining. Then the older two desired to wage war over his Mandarin oranges, and again without my asking server bought a serving yo the older minions. Then after salad, clam chowder, gigantic kids pizza, frozen grapes and cheese sticks, we left without partaking in the aforementioned mile high cake. I was feeling sick. By morning I was able to see my meal again (not pretty) by evening my three kids dropped by the hour. I initially thought it was my salmon, but I didn't share that with the kids. I wonder if it was the produce as we all shared the fruit. And insult to injury, as we get home and out of the car, a wind gust blew away son's pizza. In hindsight, maybe was a provision.",

Family in town last week, had a couple of kids with them, they wanted to go to dinner and asked about Claim Jumper, with fingers crossed, we took them, and we came away surprised and happy with our visit.   So we decided to try again tonight to see if the quality and service had Truely improved or last week was a fluke. We  can say yes it has improved!  Our server was friendly and attentive, bringing extra ranch for our app and making sure we had full glasses and plenty of napkins, not to mention asking if we were enjoying the food.   My husband and I can eat, so this was a challenge, we got fried zucchini strips as an app and for the two of us, it was way too much, about 15-18 sticks fully breaded, fried golden and extra crispy!  For entree's I got the full order chicken fried steak and my husband got the fish and chips. Everything was crispy, tasty and warm. I stiil feel their mash potatos are too thick and dry, but seasoned welled. My chicken fried was really heavy on the breading but crispy and tender, so overall, a good meal, much better than 10months or so when we last ate. Will move this place back up my list of good deals!",

Ordered wedge salad, calamari and pizza plus drinks. Requested bread while we were waiting which took a long time to arrive with no butter. Waitress came to table to say they were sold out of wedge salad??? No lettuce at 5:30 PM is unheard of. She subbed a very small Caesar salad which came out after bread was gone. Tiny order of calamari arrived 15 minutes later and pizza came after we were there ONE HOUR!!! Pizza was soft doughy like bread. Manager came to table and asked how everything was. We told him above and he took $9 off of a $17 check.  We will not be back I'm afraid. Have had bad luck with all Landry restaurants we've tried so far. Last time we were here I gave place 4 stars but no more. Don't know what changed but adios amigos",

Nice waiting area with a fireplace (not lit,shame) and an outside area for warmer months.large and very clean restaurant with friendly younger staff.  Seated quickly in a big booth, the seats are a little low or the table is too high. I'm not sure which! We are quickly served with water and our drink order is taken. \" Small or large beer?\" I'm asked. \"What's the difference?\" I enquire. \"16oz or 18oz\" is the reply. Strange, 2oz. \"Large\" because I'm crazy.   Lovely beer in a huge heavy goblet thing. Wifee has Chardonnay and kids have huge sodas with endless refills. My kids are not listening to our First Lady, Michelle O. \"bring on the sugar!\" says them....  Kids order mozzarella sticks to start. Huge, chewy, cheesy and well received.   Mains, pizza & chicken finger & fries for kids. Adventurous, no. Good? Yes.  Wifee has a nice turkey club sandwich and I order the tri-tip. The beef was very tasty but not pink as promised on the menu. They brought over an individual red velvet cake for the birthday boy which was a nice touch and it was a satisfactory night. Good choice for the family, not spectacular but certainly well worthy of further visits.",

Out of all the places we could of gone in vegas, We went to claim jumpers because we knew this place was good.. BIG MISTAKE! the service was horrible. We had a party of 8, 6 of us got our salads &soup, the other 2 got there's 15 min later and it (the soup) was cold. Again with the entree  6 came the other 2 waited for 20 min until we flagged a staff member down. We never received ketchup, ranch, cocktail sauce or refills on our drinks. The manager gave us 10% off the check. Big deal. We will never dine at this place again.",

Favorite dishes like the Whiskey Chicken, Gold Rush Chicken and others started disappearing. Prices slowly crept up. A favorite of mine, the salad bar, is now only available in a couple of locations. Then before you knew it, no more muffins with your entree.  Landry's, thanks for ruining a good thing. I have to remind myself not to be tempted coming here based on memories of great past experiences.",

    "text": "When am I going to get my desire for unhealthy foods out of my system?? Here I am again, eating burgers and fries. This time at Claim Jumper which, I am told, is known for their good burgers. I ordered the cheeseburger with double cheese (hold the Thousand Island, please).  That burger was gooooooood!!!  Oh, man.  But before the burger, we had appetizers. My friend had a couple of pomegranate sangrias, which she liked a lot. We shared pretzels, which were YUMMY, and tried the chicken wings, which were also deelish. The medium ones were tingly, but not unpleasantly spicy. She said her spicy wings were only slightly spicier than the mediums.  Back to the burger: I ordered it medium rare and it was juicy and pink. The toasted bun had just the right amount of crunch, and the lettuce and tomato were very green and red, respectively- almost made me feel better for eating a burger.  The string fries were good- nothing special, but tasty.  Claim Jumper doesn't stand out to me as being any better or more memorable than any other chain restaurant of its ilk, which it why it gets 3 stars. It does a good job for what it does. Decent food, decent service, friendly & casual atmosphere. Definitely a contender for a friends' night out, a casual date, or family meal kind of thing.",

I then complained to the manager about the horrible service and he then tells me that they do give a free dessert with a candle if it's someone's bday. I don't get why she would say no?! Racist?! And to top it off, at the end if our dinner she said 'happy birthday' to the wrong person! Anyway, end of story is we're never coming back!",

I asked the server if the soup I wanted to order had a chicken or beef base as I have been a vegetarian for 29 years. I was told that it did not have any meat in it so I ordered it. When it was delivered to my table by another service person I again asked if the soup had a chicken or beef base. Guess what? It did. I ordered the soup and salad off the lunch menu. I got the salad and guess what?  They told me it was the same size as just ordering the salad alone.  I talked with the manager who told us it was a \"teachable\" moment for the employee. And that was it. I wound up paying more for my salad than the soup and salad. The manager did not offer a substitute. No discount nothing. If I had ate the soup I would have gotten horrible stomach pains as meat is like poison to my body. Don't go to this claim jumpers. The one in Henderson is great. Hopefully this one will close up soon. Either way I will never go back.",

They made another one and it was also raw.  The manager said he would take care of it and he wouldn't charge use for it.  At that point we ordered a barbecue chicken .pizza.  Well the first thing we see on the pizza is a decent size chicken bone. So we call the manger over and he says he will take that one off the bill and did we want anything else.  He then went off to get us the bill. When he comes back he states he would take off half the bill.  We reminded him that it took two house for this fiasco and he would either take the whole bill or we would be speaking to corporate later.  So two hours later and my one daughter leaves hungry.  They completely ruined our family meal.",

    "text": "I'm wanted to be generous and give two stars, mostly because I hate being THAT lady who has one bad experience and destroys a place on Yelp.  Let me just say, though, that when a party of four walks into a restaurant two hours before closing on a Friday night and you have only one table seated in each section, there is clearly a reason.  To start, the place was darn near empty when we got there, so when my boyfriend wanted a booth, it was no problem.  We were then seated at a booth that was obviously used for two diners, as there were only two place settings, and it was a bit of a squeeze with my mom and thirteen year old brother on one side and my boyfriend and I on the other. I should note that I barely clear 5'2\" and wear a size 0 or 2, so I generally have no issues with small spaces, and my brother isn't much bigger.  We sat there, but I thought it was insane that every other booth in the section was open and they gave us the smallest one they have.  Our server, whose name I will omit, was attentive at first, got our drinks, and then made sure we had a carafe of water and tea for refills, but that was apparently so she had to interact with us as little as possible for the rest of the night.  She made no suggestions, nor did she offer to answer questions when we were trying to hammer out which/ how many appetizers to get, so since we hadn't been in years, we ordered way more than we needed to.  Okay, fine, it's a business, and the bigger the check, the bigger your tip, so I will give it to her.    Once we ordered our entrees, we didn't see her again until she asked about dessert and if we wanted the bill.  Another staff member brought our plates, and when my mom mentioned that her sandwich was wrong, the lady stared at her while she started to pick it off the sandwich right in front of her.  Her response AFTER my mom removed the items she asked to be excluded when she ordered the dish was finally \"are you sure you don't want me to take it back?\"  You just stood there and watched her pick it off, lady, you can just leave.   The food was not nearly as good as I remember from when I was younger and the restaurant first opened.  I get that it is a chain, but all of us had something wrong with our dish, and they were all sloppy and thrown together by clearly unskilled line cooks.  My vegetables were drenched in oil, which soaked into my potatoes, and I didn't even touch the mushrooms and grilled onions on my plate, as they were limp and soggy and I really wasn't sure how much I honestly wanted to force myself to eat.  We were too tired and had been ignored for too long in an empty house to care at that point.  I just wanted to leave and wasn't about to ask for a manager, since everyone in the restaurant was in the back the whole time we were there.  Not a single person said anything to us when we left, and the two people at the cooking/staging area behind the dessert case were too busy having personal conversations to notice we left.  Kind of makes me wish we had just dashed, but we paid and tipped 15% out of pity (we usually tip 25% because we know how underpaid restaurant workers are).  Even before out waitress showed up the last time to talk about the check, my boyfriend said we're never coming back.  Now I know why I swore off chain restaurants so long ago.  Claim Jumper is full of a bunch of fast food quality workers and to be honest, I've had drive through cheeseburgers that were more appetizing and put together with more care than the slop on our plates last night.",

I had the tri tip, they've done better but still the potato with skin and shoe string fries make up for it.

Another 20 minutes. Burgers were hot, but the delays were not acceptable. (now waiting to eat 1 hour) They never removed used plates. We actually had to ask for the check, which the second server had waiting in her apron pocket. They didn't comp a single item, but gave us 3 red velvet cakes to take home. So I get billed $15 for a burger I had to make( the vegetables and fixings came on 3 different plates by 3 different people) waiting for service, and the remade food was a total of 2 hours. Grandson wasn't liking the place either  Waste of $50 and we will never go back. I'm calling corporate in Monday.. We didn't go for cake. If I wanted cake, it would be the 6 layer chocolate cake.

I suppose that after nearly three years of employment there and eating for a wonderfully discounted price, which in fact allowed me to try just about EVERYTHING on the menu, a five year hiatus makes sense......right?!?!? Given the relatively higher price point of their entire menu, the four of us decided the best way to dine there was for HAPPY HOUR!  Who doesn't LOVE happy hour?!?!? =) Here's why I like it: ~App prices range from $2-6 and there is about a 20 item variety.  Even the happy hour portions are LARGE!!! ~Drinks are CHEAP and plentiful! ~Faster service in the saloon area (in my ever so humble opinion).  Plus plenty of seating and televisions for your Monday night viewing pleasure! ~Though not on the happy hour menu and outside of Cheesecake Factory, Claim Jumper has a FABULOUS DESSERT MENU!  I recommend the Red Velvet Cupcake, CHOCOLATE CHIP CALZONE (effing heaven in my mouth), bread pudding, and the mother load chocolate cake with a glass of cold milk, of course!!!  Make a point to give them a shot if you haven't....they pride themselves on service!  They're obviously doing something right........some of the same 'ole faces still working there.

They have pretty much covered there bases as far as pleasing a far ranging customer base, while still maintaining some type of quality.   I know i said the menu was huge and diverse , but as much as we used to eat here there menu didn't change much,so we moved on , anyway we decided to eat here or i should say i did.                         The food , for apps we had the fireroasted artichokes and parmesan crusted zucchini.  The artichoke needed a little more fire roasting but was still good.  The zucchini was really good it had a nice crispy coating and  had very good flavor.                       I had the citrus chix salad ( lettuce, apples, dried cranberries, mandarin orange, blue cheese , candied pecans and jerk chix.)  It was a good salad with a nice sweet vinergerette, great texture, crunchy, chewy tart , sweet .  It was good but did not blow me away, kinda disappointing.               I always order this as a side salad with my entree ,but decided to order the dinner salad portion it comes with chix.  I was always impressed when I ordered it as an  app. salad so i was expecting more out of the dinner salad.   Overall , I think they lost a step since i first came here, maybe the economy  , had something to do with it ,before on a Saturday night at 7 pm like on this night it would be a 30 min wait for sure.   Tonight seated right away and the restaurant remained half full.                      I hope they bounce back to the claim jumper i remember, Because in -laws coming to town and they really enjoy it here.",

    "text": "One of the best places in all of las vegas to eat. a little pr icy for everyday eating but well worth it. There is always a 15-30 minute wait to get in BUT it's worth it. The place is very stylish & comfy with LOTS of HIGH back booths. The Bread they bring is delicious. When you read over the MENU you will notice everything is offered in 1/2 and full sizes. The reason is 1/2 is ENOUGH for any grown man. FULL is just ridiculous. You can feed 3! We started with the bread & ordered some Taquito Shrimp since the table ext to us had & they looked great. They were very tasty-a little like a shrimp Rumaki w/soft crispy shell!! Yummy!  For dinner we had the Chicken Fried Steak-FULL which was thin & crispy with smooth & creamy gravy,the RED mashed potatoes were very garlicky, the veggies were crisp & fresh-cooked al dente.  The Ribs were so tender when you picked it up it ALL fell off the bone. VERY smoky & Rich in BBQ flavor. The beans & cornbread were perfect TOO.  The spaghetti & Meatballs was HUGE. The Meatballs were the size of an apple and very tender & seasoned perfectly. The marinara would be good on anything.  After we packed our to-go boxes we decided we had to try the MOTHER LODE-we have been buying this item in the freezer section for years now & it's $9.99 FRESH TOO!!  You could feel your ass fatten & your teeth start to ROT as you savored every sweet HOT chocolaty bite!  If you are looking to treat someone to an UNFORGETTABLE meal. Go to Claim Jumper's in Henderson or Summerlin. stay \"OFF the STRIP\"",

    "text": "Came to try food with husband. The prices were on the high side so ordered a cheeseburger. When I took the first bite, realized it was too charred/burned. I cut the burger in half n tried to each the uncharred part, but still had the charred taste in my mouth. I lost my appetite. The waitress had not come to refill my water and had been gone for a while. We felt abandoned. I was frustrated and just wanted to leave. My husband advised me to inform the Manager; I told him what good what would it do. I would have to rewait for the food. On the way out, the Manager was by the exit; I decided to tell him what had happened to my cheeseburger. His response was, \"You should've told me, we would've fixed it.\" I told him to never mind. I didn't want to hear that. We came to eat. Part of the dining out experience is getting good service and unburned food. I was not looking for free food, but was not expecting his lame answer either. Yes, they probably would've fixed what they should've gotten right the first time, but I wouldn't have wanted to wait another long period of time for something they should've gotten right at a place like Claim Jumper. I am never coming back here again. It is expensive, the service is poor, and the food is nothing special.",

    "text": "We were told to go here when we first moved to Vegas.  Like the 2 star rating says...I've had better.  The service was slow, and our waiter forgot to bring our appetizer.  My husband got the ribs and said they were prettty good.  I got the steak and should have sent it back...it was tough and dry.  Overall the ambiance is loud and crowded.  We are used to chain places, but I guess I expected more.  I may go back some day to give it another shot....but there are too many other declicious spots in Vegas:)",

However, today I received an apology letter from Texas which contained a $15 gift card. If this restaurant starts to receive favorable reviews on a consistent basis, I might try it again some day.",

The have these amazing super thin shoestring fries with awesome seasoning. First time I've been to this location, usually frequent Town Square but is very comparable. Service is very consistent between the two. Large portions, good location, great service, and plenty of seating. A little bit pricey depending what you order, but overall a nice dining experience.",

    "text": "I agree that the food is very tasty here. The only thing wrong about this place is that the portions are recklessly massive. You can feed an army with this stuff. The desserts you ask? They are HUGE. This perhaps is the reason that I am not such a great fan of this place. The amount of food does not agree well with my big belly, high cholesterol, insulin resilient, out of shape anatomy with a penchant for irresponsible alcohol consumption. Kicking my personal problems aside, I would have to say that this is a decent place for family and friends to dine in and spend time together. Great selection and service. I would have to admit that this is a bit on the expensive side. Did I mention that you get a lot of food here????",

    "text": "Friday night last minute we decide not to cook and just wanted soup and salad.  Haven't been to Claim Jumper in years and now I know why....we ordered 2 soups and 2 salads.  The first soup is delivered to another table next to our table and only after questioning where our soup was did our server notice it went to the wrong table. The person in our party ate his soup and 30 minutes later the 2 house salads are delivered.  I also ordered soup which came after I questioned where my soup was.  The garlic bread which was suppose to be served with the soups and salad, it came after we had received our salads and were 1/2 eaten.  I questioned a server about the time it took since 2 tables arriving well after we had ordered had their food which was not soup and salad and I was given a flip answer \"it's coming.\"  The manager was asked to talk to us but honestly he made matters even worse.  Craig the acting manager proceeded to argue about the time in which we had been waiting for soup and salad and asked \"what do you want.\"  Had Craig showed any understanding for our dining expierence it could have been a whole different conversation and I would not be writing this now.  This is not a 5 star restaurant and from reading the reviews I question if Claim Jumper is aware of customer service, but then again maybe they have too much busines and don't care which certainly was the attitude of the acting manager tonight.  Why have a manager if he escalates the negative expierence which he most certainly did.",

Now they are soggy and use mandarins from a can.  Just not the same fresh ingredients anymore. Yikes!  Pizza was tiny. They used to have a nice size pizza to go with the salad now it is a small mini pizza that a 10 year old wouldn't be satisfied with.  Not going back, to many good places to eat at with my money.",

    "text": "Oh!!  HORRIBLE doesn't even begin to describe it!  Do yourself a favor and just stop at the nearest McDonalds!  Mediocre (at best) service and a food disaster will remind me to never eat at this restaurant again.  My dad wanted to take my husband and I out for a nice dinner while visiting, so we could have a night off from cooking and doing dishes. A kind gesture turned into a nightmare... 1) We parked in the only shade to be found, only to get out of the car to smell the sewer steaming up from the vents below. 2) My husband and my dad ordered beers, which came out FLAT, warm, and in dirty glasses no less! 3) Our server was slow and seemed to forget most everything (it took her three visits and two requests to bring me a refill of diet soda) 4) The food I ordered came out DRY and lukewarm.  How long do you leave chicken sitting under the heater before you serve it???  The chicken was dry, dry, dry and I could tell by looking at it.  How do the cook, expediter, food runner, and server ALL miss that?  I could practically snap the chicken in half (which is what I did when the server asked how everything was).  They replaced it and took it off of the bill, but I'm still angry about it several hours later.    All in all, I will never return to this restaurant and I will spread the word verbally to everyone I know.  I am not a heinous b%@ch or a gourmet chef, but when I can cook better food in my own kitchen than be served at a restaurant, why even go out?  It's depressing, actually.",
