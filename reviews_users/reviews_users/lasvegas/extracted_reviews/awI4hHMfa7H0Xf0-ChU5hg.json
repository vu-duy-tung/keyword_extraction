    "text": "Another trip to vegas...another stop at oyster bar..another satisfied customer...  We had visited vegas during this past labor day and decided to try oyster bar during dinner instead of lunch like we did last time.. i thought to myself..its monday..its 8:45pm..there's no way there'd be a line right now...and as we walked through the casino..i saw the line of people waiting..good thing we ate a late lunch..there were about 10 people ahead of us at that time..we were seated in about an hour..but didnt actually get our food until probably another good 20min since they are only able to cook 6 orders at a time..but oh it was worth the wait!! Dolores said the line this past weekend actually started at 8am!!  This time, our server was Dolores and chef JJ. They were both extremely friendly, funny, helpful, and a delight to watch as they prepared everyone's food to perfection.    This time we orderd steam clams...bathed in garlic, butter, and seafood broth...my bf liked the broth so much he drank the whole bowl..as for the entree..we ordered... house gumbo spice level 5 with 2 scoops of rice...and lobster pan roast spice level 4 with 2 scoops of rice..OMG..we had so much leftover...i knew we over orderd for only 2 people..but..we both wanted something different....if only i had a fridge and a microwave in the hotel room..i was so sad we had to leave so much food behind...but we wanted something different...both were soo satisfying in different ways...the gumbo was savory, filled with huge chunks of lobster, shrimp, crab, and sausage with okra..the pan roast was like a creamy, rich, sweet tomato and lobster bisque with lots of lobster and crab....MMmmmm...makes me want to go back to vegas again!!  The portions are huge, prices are so reasonable for so much fresh seafood..this place beats any buffet in vegas..    Highly recommend!!!!",

We did a dozen oysters and my god were they good. Be expected to wait for at least an hour or more. Is it worth the wait? Absolutely. Yeah, you go delirious from hunger and you start babbling like a buffoon, but it's worth it. No one judges you, cause everyone in line is just as crazy from hunger. I shared a palace pot roast with a level 6 spice. It was so good, I almost saw the light!!! Woo! It's open 24 hours too, so if you wake up from night sweats cause your craving for some oysters, you know where to go. Just be advised, it only seats 18 people.",

This is by far my favorite place to eat in Vegas if I can get someone to get in line with me. I'm happy that they're finally open 24/7. The wait for me usually averages about 1.5 - 2 hours. Anyone who's ever lined up with me though says it's well worth it. That's only because they only have 18 seats. Their oysters are awesome, but my favorite is the SEAFOOD PAN ROAST. Go get it. It's the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, savory and just tummy goodness. It's like a hug for your stomach. I would marry this dish if the state of Nevada allowed me.",

The jambalaya and etouffee is \"crazy hella good\".  They're both so addicting that I can't make up my mine, so I get both.  Now, it's a lot of food.  I don't recommend you do that unless you have an appetite like me or you have a tape worm.  Sorry, that's kinda nasty.  But, you get the point.  This place always has a long line.  Make sure your phone is charged so you can preoccupy yourself while waiting.  The chefs/servers are wonderful.  I don't remember my chefs name, but he was witty and had a great sense of humor.  This place gets 4 out fo 5 \"Tadows\"!",

The clam chowder is the creamiest, with the most big pieces of clam; the least amount of sand.  The pan roast has the most shrimp, crab and lobster.  The bread is hot and not stale.  Plus if you go at the right time, you get Ricardo (the Filipino chef). He is the BEST. Pro tip: go on New Year's Day morning and for sure you will never encounter a line.  Yes it's pricey (for me) but you can bring leftovers home and add more shrimp in there for another meal.   The minus is 99% of the time there is a huge line, and people don't give a shit they are holding other people up; like they are done but just sit there and gab. It's just the trade off I guess.",

    "text": "Oyster Bar has always been on the top of my list of places to try in Vegas. I use to come to Vegas two, three, four times a year growing up and never had gotten the chance to try it up until recently. Reason for that, we NEVER wanted to wait in line. Until I finally came up with an idea; which was recent when I came with a group of friends. We decided that the guys could go wander off in the casino and gamble while the girls waited in line to get seated. We came as soon as they opened so the line wasn't too bad, it took about 30 minutes to get seated and since we had a group of six we had to split up and couldn't sit near each other, it was fine though because everyone was coupled up.   Husband and I shared:  - Palace Pan Roast This was amazing! If only I knew the ingredients that went into this. The flavor was spot on, the texture was creamy, the rice that was topped over gave it extra texture, loved it.  - Dozen Oysters It was fresh, can't go wrong with a dozen  - Shrimp Cocktail Even though they were jumbo sized shrimp, this entree only came with FOUR pieces of shrimp, was kind of sad about it.  I would love to come here again just for their Pan Roast! Totally worth the wait, just depends on how patient one is to wait in line.",

People weren't kidding when they said it was just a bar that seated 18 people. Good thing there weren't too many people in line waiting and we only had to wait 20 minutes. It took a while for the lady to clear the bar for us to sit down but at least she was very friendly.  My boyfriend and I shared a bowl of New England Clam Chowder, a Combo Pan Roast and I had a dozen oysters as an appetizer. The clam chowder was very good and it tasted better with the oyster crackers. I usually like clam chowder anyways but since my boyfriend actually ate a good amount of it, so I know it's good.  The oysters were quite tasty for being in the middle of the desert!  The combo pan roast was delicious. It was creamy with a hint of spice and some fresh seafood. The shrimp was cooked well, it was not overcooked. I don't really know what else to say about it except take a break from the food on the strip and come here because I really recommend going to this place.",

Prepare for a line, if there's a dozen people in line, you're looking at a wait of 1 to 1.5 hours easily. Generally came here at night, my first time midnight with a group of friends, and we didn't eat until 2am. And if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, it will be a good idea to take turns with a friend to wait because it gets smokey there and no where to go.   Go for the oyster shooters, round of fresh oysters (may be a bit sandy, but fresh), round of fresh clams (if you never tried it before, try it, 1 out of 5 of us in the group liked it in the end), and definitely go for the pan roast (gumbo style soup with choice of seafood, chicken, sausage, or other meats) and served with bread and rice. 1 pan roast easily feeds 2. Bread is complimentary and so so good, so be sure to ask for more. The pan roast has a coconut milk flavor to it which gives it a great richness as well.   Definitely well worth the wait and always a point of destination each time we are in Vegas.",

When it finally came to their turn another five or six people showed up and joined them. It doesn't sound like many, but when there's only 18 seats it will add another half hour to 45 minutes to your wait. Our total wait was over three hours!  If you really want to know how long it may take, it would be a good idea to ask everyone in front of you if they are holding places.    The food was delicious but it was not worth a three hour wait.

    "text": "Food: combo pan roast ~ $23 service: 3.5 stars parking: structure   I've been to Vegas plenty of times and I never heard of this place until recently. I didn't even bother yelping and ate at this place because of a friend...it was quite delicious. The pan roast was so rich in flavor, creamy, and felt like my soul was being uplifted. It was probably even more delicious because the weather was super cold, and we all know that hot food tastes a lot better then...right ? Anyhow, the pan roast itself had plenty of ingredients to chew on and was definitely filling. One thing I didn't like though is the rice portion given: you have a gigantic bowl of soup and one tiny scoop of rice -_- like do they expect me to eat a grain of rice per spoonful of soup ? lol  My recommendation if you come with two people. Sit one and get something else. The flavors are great but because of the richness of the soup it gets a little heavy.   would I come back?  oh definitely. especially if the weather is cold",

    "text": "I'm so blown away by this place, and it's making me reconsider how many five-star reviews I've given out on Yelp. Seriously, Oyster Bar exceeds this five-star rating!! The 24/7 hours, the exclusivity, the service, the portions, the quality!  Oyster Bar can only seat in about less than 20 people. My party of 7 (including me) must have waited around 2 hours on a Sunday evening, which isn't so bad considering we occupied half the bar during peak hours. The service was incredibly accommodating to our large party, warmly answering our questions despite how busy they were. Even the head chef was cracking a couple jokes with his patrons while shuffling around.  In total, we ordered a dozen oysters and three Combo Pan Roasts for our party. I asked to substitute one bowl of rice for pasta. We ended up receiving two more orders of pasta (free of charge) because the waitress made a mistake. No problem!   I almost didn't believe that a seafood bar could serve fresh oysters 24/7, but I was delightfully proven wrong. Briny, slimy, and fresh! I love ordering chilled oysters to cut into my hot and hearty foods. In this case, the Combo Pan Roast was the perfect tomato stew complement. Juicy shrimp, ribbons of soft crab and lobster--and not overtly salty as well. Instead of rice, I dipped my linguine pasta into the stew. The linguine doesn't absorb the stew the way rice does, so pick your preference on how you want to eat it.  I wish we could have ordered more, but the portions are so generous that we're gonna have to make a second trip here.   I'm not really sure what's the best time to come since Vegas never sleeps. They even have happy hour from 1am-9am, so that might attract a hungry and drunk crowd. Good luck!",

My favorite has always been the bouillabaisse with a medley of massive seafood deliciousness including crab, jumbo shrimp, lobster, scallops and so much more. This time I ordered the bouill-roast which was a secret item that was revealed due to popularity. The bouill-roast is the bouillabaisse served with a bowl of jasmine rice. Since I am asian and jasmine rice is my lifeline.... I would naturally love the bouill-roast.  We also ordered a dozen (bakers dozen) of oysters. I wouldn't say that they were the best oysters I've ever had. I actually like petite oysters that don't involve to much chewing.   Anyway, this oyster bar will always hold a special place in my heart!",

My tip to kill time: order the $10 large 23oz  beer which comes with $5 refills.  Me and my girlfriend make this our first stop every time we come to vegas. We always order the palace pan roast, dozen of oysters and the $10 beer.  For the pan roast, we get a 7 on the spicy level. Is this hot? Definitely, but I would not recommend it for someone who is not used to eating too spicy.  This place is amazing. I cannot say more. Am I hyping this place up too much? If you think so, it's okay not to come so I don't have to wait more than 1 hour.  This is definitely a hidden gem. Not so hidden anymore because I'm sharing with the world.",

The whole experience was enjoyable before I even got my food, because of the people who were behind the counter.  Norayma is amazing as she shucked oysters and clams and Christyna too, they were both funny.  Chef Eze had a smile on his face the whole time as he does his thang.  The staff here are so happy, they seem to love it here and it makes me love it even more too.  I hope this place never becomes a full restaurant because we will lose the experience of seeing our food prepared before us and handed to us right over the counter.  It takes a while because the Chef cooks and then cleans his pots in between every order.  Everything is fresh and scrumptious.     Worth the wait, worth every bite, worth every cent.",

I mean, all those options are soooo damn good. But my friend had insisted for nearly a year that I try Oyster Bar. This combo pan roast, it is amazing she said. Well after enough near misses, I finally waltzed my way over here to get this over with.  Pro tip before coming here (and one that I wouldn't have picked up if I hadn't read all these Yelp reviews)...when they say BAR, they actually MEAN a bar. I didn't take a count, but I'm pretty sure there is at most 20 seats here. Which means if you come here at the WRONG time, you gonna be standing in line foreverrrrr and wondering why you're not at the tables killing time. Oh right, because you got no choice since Palace Station is in the middle of nowhere! So come here at the right time, which translates to some odd time that no one will be there like Thursday at 3:30 PM. Nary a wait (until 10 minutes after we got seated...yeah, it fills up THAT fast)!  Anyways, let's get down to business. THAT COMBO PAN ROAST IS FREAKING DELICIOUS. Crab, shrimp, and lobster in a creamy tomato sauce with a side of rice. They cook it right in front of you so it's about as fresh as you can possibly want. I can say without hesitation that I've never eaten anything quite like this before. And I can also say that Oyster Bar has now vaulted on to the Vegas food rotation simply because of this combo pan roast. It is an absolute must have. BTW, their New England clam chowder ain't too bad either.  So now that I've finally made it to Oyster Bar and approve wholeheartedly, now I just gotta figure out the next time I can come here and avoid the stupid line. :P",

Since there is such limited seating, even if it doesn't seem like the line is long, it can take a while.  We ended up waiting about 50 minutes when we went there around 9pm on a weekday.  Service:  Prompt, the food is cooked in front of you and the waiter attends to you pretty quickly.  Food:  The main reason for my average rating.  We had raw oysters, house gumbo and combo pan roast.  I'm not a fan of big oysters, and the oysters they had were really large.  It wasn't briny and succulent, just big.   The gumbo was very, very salty.  Not sure if we got the bottom of the stock, but even with the scoop of rice, we could only stomach a couple of bites. The pan roast was excellent, and the reason I still gave 3 stars.  It wasn't salty at all, just rich and flavorful.  We ended up just eating the pan roast and left the gumbo untouched.  I guess if we didn't order the gumbo we would have been impressed overall, but the gumbo just ruined it for us.  I don't mind the wait at restaurants if the food makes up for it.  After all, they can't control how many people are willing to wait.  Now that I've tried this place I'm comfortable knowing I'm not missing anything spectacular... for me, anyways.  tip:  I like spicy food and we ordered level 7, which wasn't that spicy.  I would order at least level 7 if you like your food with a kick.",

One hour later, you're too far in and can't leave. Two hours later, you're way too committed and definitely can't leave now. Three hours later, you finally score some seats at the bar! Was it worth it? Definitely not! But was it worth introducing this famous spot to some friends visiting Vegas so that they can brag about it, yes!  The oyster bar only seats 18 people (I counted)  with only one or two cooks at any given time. They cook the food right in front of you so don't expect a quick turnover rate at this place. If you see empty chairs, don't rush the waiters since it's pointless if the cooks can't cook fast enough. Let them manage the bar as they know what's best.  Definitely order a dozen fresh oysters and the combination pan roast, two of their signature dishes. The pan roast is full of flavor. Shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage (if you order the palace pan roast) served over a scoop of white rice definitely hits the spot for any occasion whether hungover or just hungry. Vibrant on the eyes with its beautiful orange color and kind of the nose with pleasant smells.   If you want to try the pan roast, consider visiting the other \"stations\" for a shorter wait time. The original location at palace station is a guaranteed two or three hour wait at peak hours. I visited the sunset station location and waited only ten minutes. The quality was comparable. Save yourself some time unless you have a very picky palate.",

Just great oysters from Louisiana. I usually get them most time with my order.   Sausage Gumbo: 5/10. Probably the only bad thing on the menu. The flavors just didnt get to simmer like a gumbo should. Now the seafood might be good. Never had it. And the chefs are really good here.   Bouillabaisse: 7.5/10: I remember this being really really amazing. When I tried it recently the suace I felt could of been diluted a lil bit more. The tomato flavor over powered it a lil bit. Still it was really delicious.   Chowder: 7.8/10. Solid chowder. Clams a bit chewy. Meaning left in the pot to long or not fresh. I would guess the first. But with the Alaskan Chowder and pan roast as options I'll be skipping the chowder most the time.",

Here's a pro-tip, bring those small portable camping chairs, external Battery chargers, .and 99 margaritas! It will make your wait less painful. Albert S. and I had a lot of fun waiting in line... lol   Once we got seated, we ordered the gumbo combo (3.75/5) and the Bull's roast which is a mix of pans roast and boullet roast. I really really liked this.. and give it a 5!!! Yummmmm!   I will definitely be back once im in vegas but I'll probably go at like 4 in the morning or something when there's no wait.. lol",

    "text": "The Oyster Bar is the pearl found inside Palace Station. When you enter thru the front, it's a short walk around the corner and on your right hand side where the Slot Machines are located. If you've gone to the card games, make the next available U-turn.   It's a small bartop with seats for less than 20 guests. So because of the limited seating, it's a minimum 30 minute wait at any given time during the day. However, there's a silver lining: THEY'RE OPEN 24 HOURS.  The wait really isn't bad since you can have one person wait in line while everyone else gambles and loads up on drinks first.  Everything on the menu looks like a fine selection, but today we decided on the full dozen oysters, steamed New Zealand clams, and the Panroast Combo dish.   First order up was the clam soup. It's a great starter with decent sized clams and a light broth. Honestly, it's nothing you can't make it home. Moving on, we had the dozen oysters. We watched as the pre-shucked oysters were opened in front of us by our server. She explained to us that it was from a particular vendor - Gold Band Oysters that preshuck the oysters and then tie a yellow band around the oysters to prevent them from opening and losing flavor. Got to say, great job. The oysters were so fresh, you can wipe the dirt off your fingers after each bite. You can have your oysters anyway you like. We opted for the extra cocktail and horseradish, a spritz of lemon and a couple pumps of the Tabasco. Bon appetit.   Last, but not least, we had the Panroast Combo dish with a spice level of 6/10. Chef Bob is known for adding an extra kick to his batches so we decided to play it safe. That was the right call as the dish was flavorful, but not overwhelmingly spicy. Scoop it on top of your side of white rice and dive in. The flavors just burst out of each bite of shrimp/crab/lobster, but doesn't linger as the rice cleanses your pallet. If it was gonna be compared to another dish, textually, think Thai curry...   Overall, this place is amazing. Great food, fun staff, casual atmosphere. The only downside is the line, but the wait might enhance the experience and make you crave the food that much more.",

You must plan your trip around a visit to the Palace Station to hop in line for one of the coveted 18 seats at the Oyster Bar.  There's always a line but I'll tell you a little secret. The best time to go without a wait is for breakfast. Otherwise, you're looking at a minimum of 1 hour if you're lucky. Average wait time is usually 2 hours depending when you go.  Is it worth the wait? Absolutely. What should order? Their oysters are so fresh and their clam chowder is amazing and of course the PAN ROAST. I've been to New Orleans and did not even see Pan Roast on any menus. I've had Pan Roast at other restaurants in Southern California but its just not the same. There's something about their secret soup base. We'll never know, maybe it's crack. You can only get it here. Always imitated but never duplicated they say.  Please don't knock it until you try it. This place is not over hyped. So grab your fully charged cell phone and comfortable shoes and head on over to Oyster Bar to wait in line  and you will not be disappointed.",

Before recieving my food. We were given bread and there are bowl filled with butter chips for you to use. The food however was well worth the wait!!! We got the linguine and clams with a lobster pan roast. The linguine was probably okay we got a 5 for the heat and it wasn't spicy at all it was a little bland in my opinion. The lobster pan roast however we got a 7 for the heat and i thought it was a little too spicy for me but my boyfriend loved it and icouldnt stop eating it because of how good it was! The staff are all very nice and try to get to you as quickly as possible. -1 star because of the wait however that is expected because its vegas and the slightly bland linguine.",

It's spicy garlicky and and creamy all cooked together like a nice thick stew served with rice if I lived in Vegas I would eat this every day! The people who work at this restaurant are the best, they are EXTREMELY BUSY so just be patient and wait your turn its well worth the wait. My only complaint it that the casino is so smoky inside I wish this place was located elsewhere. I don't mind waiting well I do but I wouldn't want this place to be any bigger it would take away from it but maybe they can open another one!   No kids its bar seating only, prepare to wait in line, no saving spaces, be nice everyone else has been waiting too. Your food is cooked to order if they did it any differently they would ruin this place.   Combo Pan roast Alaskan Chowder and I'm a happy girl!",

Here's a tip, don't wait until it's lunch time or dinner time when EVERYONE starts running to get in line, go in between those times so you don't have to wait. I would suggest if you are waiting in line with a group of people? Take turns go grab a drink, have a drink in hand or you better be buzzed at least while waiting in line, because it ain't going to be fun when you are sober, and that is when you will probably start complaining. Better drink up buddies!  Ordered the Seafood  bouillabaisse  gumbo (enough to share with two) - wayyy good. Enjoyed watching them make it. Fresh seafood, cooked well and seasoned well. They will ask for how spicy you will like your food, so adjust your taste buds.   Recommend oyster shooters and raw oysters! Always ask what kind they have, because it's always different. Don't forget to grab a beer while at it. You cannot eat seafood without a glass of your favorite beer.   Don't recommend group since it's just a small bar area to eat, may have to wait longer. Do recommend coming here in the middle of the night, their late night specials are awesome! Clubbing late and crave for food and more drinks? This be the place, but beware of long lines. Cannot wait to come back to try the late happy hour.",

We also like the Sunset Station Oyster Bar & just about anything on the menu.   You also can't go wrong with Briggs Oyster Bar at the Suncoast Casino.

Best way to get straight to the Oyster Bar is to come in from the Casino Valet drop off through the multiple glass doors. It's maybe about 100 ft as you enter. I only come for the Pan Roast. I like mine at level 7 spicy. I like spice as long as it doesn't cause that uncomfortable burn which can end up ruining the dish for me, so hopefully that will help in your selection. To be safe, you can just go with a level 5 and ask for pepper sprinkles to be added for higher intensity after.",

    "text": "Wow.  You have to order the \"Palace Pan Roast\" here.   Sure, it's not near The Strip as it is inside Palace Station. And sure, the line can even be hours long (heard it was cutting down the casino floor). But it is amazing.  Came here with friends who recommended that we do this to start our Vegas weekend off right. There wasn't a line when we got there, but as we dined, the line got longer and longer. I could only imagine how long it would be during lunch or dinner or even late night. The wait is due to this being actual bar seating. There's maybe 15 or so bar seats. Everything is cooked in front of you.  Shared the \"Palace Pan Roast\" between 3 people. Level 7 spicy. Has a nice spice to it and do expect to sweat a little with the Level 7, but the spices and the brandy just give it that delicious flavor along with the other flavors from the shrimp, crab, chicken and Andouille sausage.  Ordered some rice with it as well and it's a meal. They also give you a piece of bread. Don't eat it as hungry as you might be. It's a nice crusty bread to dip into your pan roast!  Leftovers are even more amazing. Buy some potato chips and enjoy a nice and flavorful pan roast dip with your chips.  Other menu items on the menu as well such as oysters, gumbo, etc. But only came here specifically for the Palace Pan Roast with Level 7 Spicy and white rice on the side.  Definitely a go-to place when in Vegas now.",

    "text": "Tasty food--I love the Lobster Pan Roast the most. But that wait is terrible. No matter when you go, even if there's no line, they just take forever to take your order, make your food, and get your check. The operations of the place drive me crazy! But, they're popular and they don't care. The philosophy of the place is that you just have to wait. But add that to a line and the fact that Oyster Bar only has ~20 seats, and boy, you'll be there for 1.5-2 hours!  I've also tried the clam linguine, which is good, but not as good as the pan roast. They don't have much in terms of vegetables, but they do have a pretty good Caesar salad if you're inclined that way. The servings are HUGE and note that there is a $5 share charge for entrees.",

Pro Tip: The higher spice level you go the saltier it gets unfortunately! I usually eat really spicy, I've gotten a 9 here but it was terribly salty!   Best times to go: 7AM-10AM (1 person in line usually or no wait at all) Don't come after 10AM - 4AM it's usually 1HR 3mins - 2HRS !!!!!",

    "text": "The last thing you want to do when driving from LA to Vegas is wait for food... After a 4.5 hour drive, some in traffic, my Vegas sidekick mentioned a local known seafood restaurant located at the Palace Hotel. The hotel is and older hotel and off the strip. With 4.5 yelp stars, it's hard to ignore this place.   The restaurant is a restaurant bar that only seats 18. The line is along a walkway of slot machines. With 18 people deep at 10:00 pm, the wait was about an hour and half.  Standing in line, both tired and hungry, I was questioning our decision to come here as my stomach was growling.    We were finally seated. The two dishes that caught my eye was the bouillabaisse and pan roast. I ordered the bouillabaisse and my sidekick ordered the other. Bouillabaisse came in a mild spice tomato broth with onions, celery, shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels, and clams. Utterly delicious! Honestly could eat this a few times a month. The Pan Roast was delicious as well. It's composed of shrimp, crab, lobster sauteed with brandy, cream, tomato and served with steamed rice. Very good as well but a bit too rich for me. Pan roast could feed two people. Each dish was $23.99. Not bad considering the amount of seafood.   Service here was just okay. Just like most casino restaurants, no sense of urgency. A bit on the slow side. It was about midnight when we left and the line was 15 deep.   Worth a try if you're in town.",

The line wasn't bad at all, we were 3rd in line but the total wait from beginning until we got our food was probably 2 hours but it was sooo worth it!!! When I took my first spoonful of the house pan-roast with lobster added, it was basically an orgasm in my mouth.  I was in foodie heaven!    And, big shout out to chef Holloman!  The dude is hilarious, clearly loves what he does, and is great entertainment for all of us!  We came back the following night cause we were hooked and he wasn't there and it just wasn't the same.    Anyway, my mouth is watering just thinking of this place.    We tried a similar place afterwards in LA that claims to have stolen the chef from Oyster Bar but it was NOT the same.  This will be an obligatory stop every time we come to Las Vegas!",

If you tell your taxi driver \"take me to Palace Station\" they will likely ask \"going to the oyster bar?\".  It's that well known.  To get to the point: The Oyster Bar is a 20-seat bar that serves average oysters and very-good Cajun food. The pan roast is really, really good.  You will wait 60-90 minutes in a line with 25 people in it to get seated. Even if it is midnight on a Sunday.  I'm not sure how the legend of this place persists. It is a good Cajun meal. But, the wait time and the fact the oysters are pretty average will probably keep me from going back.",

    "text": "We came here on Labor Day at 12am and waited for 2 hours. The waitress said it would take 3 hours but we still didn't mind. There were about 10 parties ahead of us. Also, I didn't know this place was actually a BAR. It's surrounded by the slot machines and there are no tables. So everyone is sitting at the bar facing the cook and waitress.  Oyster (half dozen) - $12. So fresh! They shuck the oysters to order and I saw them throw away oysters that aren't Oyster Bar approved. So it's nice to see that they care about the quality of their food. We were debating on getting the dozen since it was only $6 more. I regret not getting the dozen.  Combo Pan Roast - $23. My husband and I shared and it was a perfect portion for us. The cook gave us 2 bowls of rice and didn't charge a split plate fee, which we thought they would. I think they just gave us less rice each. The shrimp was so great. It was not overcooked and just the way I liked it...a bit undercooked. The crab was shredded in the sauce which I don't prefer but it was still good and the lobster were in chunks.  Service - Our waitress was so kind and fast! I forgot her name but she kept moving and serving everyone. I also saw the cook go around the bar to clean the table. I thought that was cool since you don't ever see that! Definitely a team oriented restaurant. The cook also joked around with us that they ran out of oysters.  I'm from southern california and this reminded me of The Boiler in Chino Hills. Oyster Bar is a great find but it didn't amaze me as much as I had hoped.",

    "text": "Wow.... I was SO sure I had already written a review on this place....   So, Oyster Bar... what can I say that hasn't already been said?  Probably not much.   FIRST off, get over the fact that its located inside the Palace Station Casino.  That threw me for a loop the first time I went, but I easily got over it after the first spoonful of food.    SECOND, get over the fact that the seating is literally A BAR and very limited.    THIRD, get over the wait.  Ok, wait, let me rephrase.  If its 12-15 people deep, forget it and come back at 8am.  However, if only a handful, wait.  It's SO worth it.    I read the reviews and came here first with my cousin.  She wanted seafood I was game.  Though when I figured out what casino it was I was hesitant.  When I walked into the old casino I was like, oh geez... are we gonna get food poisoning?  However, we waited in line.  After about 40 minutes she and I were starving and ready to give up.  And the girl in front of us turned around and said it was worth the wait.  So.... given we had waited this long already we waited some more.    Pan roast...wtf is a pan roast?   I though it was a roast of beef or something.  Clueless I was!  We shared a combo pan roast, number 5 on spicy scale and a dozen oysters.  Sure... so I thought these massively large oysters were ridiculously altered genetically, but they were fresh and delicious....so I chomped my way through those.   What can I say about the rest of the meal??? Um.. the first time I went here I was dizzy from elation.  I mean it looks like a tomatoey, cream based soup if nothing else.... but it is delectable!  Went back to Vegas for Christmas after that visit and I dragged my unhappy husband there for lunch.  We tried to go the night before but at 1130pm, there was a retardedly long line which I estimated would not be a happy wait.  I was afraid too that our group would give out and end up at Subway around the corner!  So... lunchtime... grumbling husband about how this better be good....   We each got our separate soups (how greedy, huh). I got the combo pan roast, level 5, he got the etoufee, level 6 (Silly boy).  They were both yummy, but because the etoufee was too hot for us, we had to keep switching bowls to let the other person's mouth cool down.  Our group didn't come with us for this lunch...so they insisted on coming the next day.  Fast forward next day... at 830am we get there and voila, NO ONE.  Not one person was there, no line, nothing.  We sat right in the middle and the 4 of us proceeded to order our food.  As we were waiting for our stews to cook, all of the sudden the whole place was full of diners... lol.  So we figure the magic hour is between 8am and 9am.   The place is open 24 hours so you can experiment however you wish.    Hubby came back a month later for a conference.... dragged a couple more of his coworkers to eat here.  He tells me with glee that it was awesome.  OF COURSE IT WAS!  They are consistently good, always!  Bob cooked for us twice when we were in Vegas and I wish we could just package this stuff and take it home with us.  Wish they'd ship across the country.  Even if not exactly like the real thing, I'd even take something that comes close!   Go and try... you won't regret it.",

Great variety of seafood boils including gumbo options too. Raw oysters were plump and delicious. We were thankful to meet and visit with a lovely person in line to make the time go fast. This is one of my favorites in Vegas!!",

Holy cow was that a great call. The help took me under their wings and had me order a pan roast. There was two big chunks of lobster, a boat load of shrimp, chunks of fresh crab meat and sweet scallops. The sauce was a tomato, butter and cream base that melted in mouth as it complimented the rest of the dish. The smell draws you in as the food kicks your pallets butt. Go early, and go hungry.",

I want to say it's like a hole in the wall joint, but it kind of isn't because it's smack down in the middle of the casino - which already adds to the one of a kind experience.  My friend and I ordered oysters, gumbo, and jambalaya.  All were incredibly fresh and absolutely seafood meaty!  I don't think you can go wrong with anything on that menu.  However, with a wait that long on a Tuesday evening, my friend ended up buying cookies from another restaurant in the hotel to hold our hunger during the two hour anticipation.  When we sat at the bar, the chef thought they were donuts and would not stop thinking how silly we were to have a sweet treat before the gourmet meal he'd prepare right in front of us.  It was silly, but it broke the ice for us!  On top of witnessing the skills of our chef and falling into the aroma of the seafood smells, we received a show in True Vegas fashion.  Our chef sang for us, narrated his cooking methods, and even shared personal stories with us!  It was a great evening with food that was nothing short of amazing.  Save some time and patience when you plan on coming here, but definitely come hungry and don't miss out on this Vegas Best Bite!",

The Oyster bar had great reviews and didn't look too expensive, plus it sounded like a great adventure, so we dropped the address in our nav and headed to Palace Station. It was quite a change from the upscale casinos we had visited on the strip, but it was a classic. We found the line and one of us waited while the other made drink runs, and we waited about 40 minutes with 8-10 people ahead of us. No worries, though -- there was great people-watching and we could take turns playing the slots a little bit while we waited.  Really, the wait was worth it. The oysters were really fresh, and watching Holloman make our pan fried was definitely entertaining. Everything is made in the steamer right in front of you and you can watch every step, request your spice level, and add or adjust ingredients as you like. The portions were generous and the company was fun.   The next time we are in Vegas, or even just driving through, we'll stop by the Oyster Bar for sure!",

It was so delicious and for spicy and seafood lovers this won't disappoint. However you can adjust your spicy level 1-10. It hits the right spot especially in colder months. They give you a warm sourdough roll to start and you can dip it in your stew or chowder. I had the oyster shooters for the first time too which you can have with either vodka or tequila. It was a thrilling experience with an oyster i definitely will try again. It's limited seating and this place stays busy but the wait is worth it!",

The chowder and the oysters were excellent but things fell flat when I came to the $27 lobster grilled cheese sandwich.  I was not blown away with the flavor and it was somewhat of a let down.  Just didn't think it was $27 good. Maybe $10 good.  The chips that came with it were pretty damn tasty!  I highly enjoyed them! Much more so than the sandwich.  Overall, this place did just fine.  I'd be interested in trying some of the other plates they have to offer along with those fat, glorious oysters!",

We are sad to know that Chef Ricardo don't work there anymore, he always makes us feel welcome and at home. Chef Ricardo never get stress when it's super busy, he just keep on cooking non stop with all his delicious cuisines, he's also funny and makes everyone laugh.

I do not recommend for a party larger than 4. It is on a bar that seats about 15. I went at a non-peak hour (Tuesday 2:30AM) and it was about a 30 min wait.   The oysters were huge and delicious, but not the highlight of the meal. Just try the bouillabaisse 1 time and you will understand.   I always stay on the strip when I visit Vegas. Palace Station is a $10 Uber ride from The Linq. Definitely worth it. Just make $20 on a slot to cover the round trip.  The limited seating will make for super long waits so anticipate it. Either sacrifice the time or go during dead hours. It's open 24 hrs and they featured $1 oysters 6:00am-10:00am.",

The best flavor IMO for what it is and waaaayy better than the fanciest schmaniest seafood joint you can find at any of the resorts!! SERIOUSLY!   also fitting that this restaurant is located where it is away from the strip and at a Ma&Pa Casino Hotel.  it is not your typical sit down eatery tho...its a half circle Bar.  you line up and wait for a seat or seats to open up for you accordingly. LINE UP SOONER THAN LATER because if you lagg on it then you can literally wait UP TO 3 hrs to sit down and enjoi a meal ...but that can be a good thing!!! yes, the food IS that good.",

YES!!!!!  The Palace Station isn't exactly on the strip, or even strip-adjacent, but it's worth a visit. They have oysters (obviously), clam chowder, etc .... but my favorite thing by a mile is the Pan Roast. This.Soup.Is.Amazing!  Make sure you gauge your spicy level ... i get a 7 and it's as high as i'm willing to go (and i'm good with spicy food) ... don't be a hero, enjoy your food with the level that's good for you.   They also give you rice to go with it, which is great after a long night of drinking.   I don't think I've ever seen this place without a line, and that makes sense to me. The workers are nice, the food is great and the prices are reasonable (for Vegas standards).   Overall I would recommend this place to anyone willing to take a trip slightly off strip for a great meal.   Note: This is bar seating and very limited, so not great for groups or people who are very VERY hungry.  Stay Cheerful ;)",

    "text": "With the \"Bouill-Roast\" at the Palace Station Oyster Bar being the best thing I ate from my last review, it really shouldn't be a surprise for me to come back to have it again with my last recent visit.  I came back to The Oyster Bar for another late night session at around 1:30am on a Wednesday night.  What was different this time around that I had to wait a while longer to get seated and the prices had gone up just a little.  And although I was tempted to try something different like their Jambalaya or Lobster Pan Roast, I really couldn't resist getting another Bouill-Roast.  Bouill-Roast -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lhzz9A&s=16d64bd00d6cf215a1b7d655c7a311e5689b871a1660ea7295cfab67beaca744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lhzz9A</a> Their pan roast and bouillabaisse 'accidentally' combined together with shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels, clams and a hint of Brandy. Granted I was a little skeptical this time thinking that the first time I had it was a fluke.  I'm glad to say that it wasn't and I enjoyed it even more this time around.  It might have been due to the fact that I waited almost an hour in line to have it again, but all that was forgotten while I enjoyed all the seafood awesomeness that was in the Bouill-Roast.  So yeah, after a couple of visits to the Palace Station Oyster Bar and having enjoyed their epic Bouill-Roast twice, PSOB has officially become a 'Must-Visit' for me and is a go-to late night option for me by default.  Can't wait for go back again for another late-night Bouill-Roast!",

A lot of little details with this place.. like the way he wrapped my meal to go... double wrapped, no spillage possible. Awesome food! Woke up at 4am and ate my leftovers . My only gripe is that with the line being long, they didn't take parties of one in the middle of the long line... you still had to wait til you were number one in line (as a party of one) even though a seat was available for awhile.",

    "text": "The overall experience including the 4-hour wait for seats? It gets a 2-star from me. It's certainly not worth the wait. Hardly anything is if the wait is 4 hours long. What I don't get is why they won't take names and call when seat are available. Isn't it better if people get the chance to wait at the blackjack table? That just confuses me... having people in line doesn't make you more money.. Maybe it's an ego thing.... (hey! I got all these fools to stand in line for 4 hours). Oh, and why not put some chairs out?  The food is 3.5 stars. Maybe we have pretty high standards of oysters and gumbos, . Don't get me wrong, the food is decent. But calling yourself \"the oyster bar\" when offering only 1 kind of oyster (and not a good kind) is sort of like calling your car dealership \"the car megastore\" when only selling one kind of car in one color... and it is the \"Corolla\" in beige... Again, not that Corolla is a bad car, but there are just so much more..... Not to mention the sandy oysters?  So, what else did we order? We ordered the Bouill-Roast, the dirty chowder, and the crab gumbo. Out of the three, the Bouill-Roast wins it hands down. It was tasty and the seafood is fresh (read between the lines... the shrimp is frozen out of a bag - yes, we saw them dumping whole bags of them into the bowl). And who knows if the lobster and crabs are also frozen?  When you are in Vegas, you must have better things to do than waiting in line for 4 hours.. in our case, it was 10:30pm and we were broke from the gambling table.. so we were glad we finally tried this place. But, probably never again.",

You have to physically wait on a line. Wish they had a sign up sheet or buzzers so I could go dunk my money away at a slot machine. Well, I guess it was for my own good.   The oysters are Gold Band oysters, meaning they've been power washed of the grit and \"pasteurized.\" These are also known as pre-shucked oysters. The bands keep them together. I was amazed at how quickly they were shucked, but after further research, I see that the workers are awesome but don't have superpowers (;   The food is made in portion sized pots right at the bar. It's entertaining to watch all of the steps to make the dishes. Level 6 spicy is just right to make the nose start to run.   Really great value for tasty seafood. The portions are generous!

Call me crazy, but we waited 3 hours a couple of times.  Was it worth it?  Well heck yeah it was worth it. I waited didn't I. With that said, don't come here at peak times, lunch and dinner hungry as you might faint from waiting. Eat a small smack to tie you over until you can be served one of the best meals of your life.   We tried their oysters and we tried them all. You can have it a couple different ways. You can have it the regular way (oysters on a half shell) $11.99 for a 1/2 dozen or $19.99 for a dozen. Or you can get oyster shooters with either tequila or vodka $5 each or three for $12.  I'm not a big an of the shooters but other in my party liked them (probably because they are alcoholics). But I loved the oysters on the half shell.   I love the Pan Roast. It's a creamy tomatoe based soup type dish.  I normally get the combo pan roast which has shrimp, crab, and lobster in it.  $23.99  You can also order it with just shrimp, crab, or lobster. They also have the Palace Station Pan Roast which has crab, shrimp, chicken, and andouille sausage.   I also tried had the House Gumbo $23.99. It has shrimp, crab, Lobster, in a rich Creole base soup.   They also serve wines, beers and other mixed drinks.   Do they have a happy hour???  Yes they have a midnight special from 1am till 9am. Oysters on a half shell 1/2 dozen for $10.  They also have 23oz beer for $10 with half price refills.   To me the best time to come is around 5am to 8am. Then again one never knows. So remember have some patience or a lot of patience. Eat a small snack to hold you over as you will wait either in line, to order, to get your food, and to get your bill.",

    "text": "Ok, where was I, writing reviews for all other places and forgot to write an awesome review for this great restaurant!! I love OYSTER BAR and this is the only place I visit EVERY TIME I come to Vegas. I know theres a restaurant that opened up near my parents house in Alhambra, CA that basically specializes in same food as Oyster Bar and I hear that it is opened by one of the chefs that worked here. Believe it or not, I have yet to try that place so until then, I will just keep coming to Oyster Bar whenever I am visiting Vegas.  So yes, waiting can be ridiculous if you come during lunch, dinner time. If you want to wait less, try coming before noon. Line is definitely shorter and you will not have to wait more than an hour. I tried coming here after midnight, and the line at that time was pretty long too. If you come around 3-4 AM, theres not much waiting so timing is KEY. Theres only 12-14 seats available with only 6 pots to cook and perhaps thats why wait can be forever but I think food is worth it. Once, I waited more than 3 hours and gosh I was so annoyed but food was so good that I forgot about it. Now that I came here so many times, I know when is the best time to visit, hehe.  Once you take your seat, they will bring you a soft, warm dinner roll. You can eat it with butter placed on the table. Its good when its warm. You can ask for as many as you like while you wait for your main dish.  One of their signature dishes is the Pan Roast. They have many variations with lobster, shrimp, crab meat and whatnot but I always get the Palace Pan Roast. I like the andouille sausage and chicken in this pan roast which adds not only flavor but texture as well. Once I ordered Lobster Pan Roast and I didnt like that everything was too soft so it really didnt feel like I was eating any seafood. Ever since then, I find myself ordering Palace Pan Roast all the time. I always get so greedy after waiting in line for so long. I always tell my boyfriend or friends, 'lets get one each!' Well, never again, haha. I can NEVER finish this alone. I feel like even two of us can barely finish one pan roast. Yes, you can order one per person but you probably are taking the leftover home. I hate taking leftover and I never eat them when I do. So I rather enjoy the food while I am here. One pan roast is ENOUGH for 2 people. Trust me!  Though they put a scoop of rice in the pan roast, I prefer eating them on the side. I always tell them I want the rice on the side. Its better I think because rice can soak up all the pan roast and then it gets thick & nasty. They also have pasta noodles (fettuccini) and its good with it also. But I definitely prefer eating them with rice over pasta. Oh, I know they have a sharing fee ($5) if you share one entree but sometimes I see it on my receipt and sometimes not. So I dont know, cross your fingers and hope that they dont charge you? Haha  Another dish I love at this place is their OYSTERS!! Their oysters are so fresh, juicy and big! They arent fishy and I love eating them. I can probably eat 3 dozens myself! Thats how much I love oysters. I asked them where their oysters are from, and on my recent visit, they told me it was from Louisiana. I loved them so much and my boyfriend also loves oysters and we devoured them!!  Servers here are very fast and they are one od the best servers you can find. You never have to tell them anything because they will get you whatever you need before you even ask, like filling my water cups!  They have many chefs here making your pan roasts and other southern dishes like jambalaya, gumbo and etc. Depending on the chef, your spicy level can vary as well. I once went with 7 thinking it wouldnt be too spicy because I had level 7 before with the other chef and guess what? It was way too spicy with the other chef so I couldnt enjoy my food at all. So ask the server about spicy level for the chef working that day. They can definitely help you with that.  Enjoy your pan roast and oysters! After 1 AM (and to 8 AM) they have specials like half dozen oysters for $10 and other drinks at discounted price as well. You wont be disappointed. Trust me.  I'm giving them a 4 star just because the wait can be forever. If it wasnt for that, this place will be a 5 star restaurant in my book!",

I had the combo pan roast (by far the most popular dish) and the BF had the Alaskan chowder. Both were so delicious. Generous portions of seafood in a velvety, well-seasoned sauce. Definitely get a glass of wine or beer too (for all your hard work waiting...) Service was friendly, and the server said the best time to come is at 7:30 A.M. Oh man!!  (For the record, I would wait 45 minutes at most in the future...)",

    "text": "Worth a 2-4 hr wait? Meh, not so much.  But is it tasty? For sure!  Are they the best oysters in town? Not really.   Is there all kinds of different oysters on the menu? Nope. All they offer oyster-wise is one kind of raw oyster. And you don't get little forks, lemon covers, or mignonette sauce. No oysters Rockefeller or other items. I definitely found that a little disappointing. But the raw oysters were most definitely fresh and yum.  They also offer raw clams, cooked clams, cooked mussels, raw shrimp, etc. They also have salads and chowders of various styles, as well as various gumbos and a few other offerings.  The main star here is actually the pan roasts. These are large! Pro-tip: Don't say the word \"share\". They charge $5 for sharing. Not a split plate charge, but an actual charge for just trying to share a large item. But the pan roasts are unique and yum. We opted for the one that has shrimp, crab, and lobster. It's just lump crab, not actual good crab. But the lobster was good. The flavor was fabulous. You choose the spice-level on a scale of 1-10. I love spicy things and, honestly, couldn't have handled more than a 5. It's rich and full of flavor. Be sure to try one of these.  The seating is super limited. The wait is long. The servers are in no hurry to turnover seats - even in terms of just clearing the plates once someone has left. The cook was fun and friendly. The other folks behind the bar not at all.  So in sum, get a pan roast and some raw oysters. But I wouldn't wait around for hours to eat here again. Perhaps try some time in the middle of the night?",

    "text": "Oyster Bar has been around for over 20 years.  The business is now opened 24 hours.   Oyster Bar is quite popular even though it's a hidden gym in Palace Station.  The restaurant is located in an open area in the casino.  There are about 15 seats at the bar.  The food is made fresh to the order.  So, the lines are usually at least 1-1.5 hour wait.  I would come when it's off hours.    But it just depends on your luck.  I was lucky once and only waited 30 mins.  I also wouldn't come with a large group because it will be hard to all seat together and you won't be able to enjoy an intimate conversation since you're still at the bar.    The food hands down is worth the wait.  Everything on the menu are good size where you can share.  They do give you a scoop of rice for each gumbo or pan roast entrees.  If you want another scoop of rice, it will be another $2.99,  My favorite is the crab salad, combo pan roast, and Alaskan Chower.  The oysters are a $1 a piece too.  All the entrees are super fresh and very rich with flavor.     Combo Pan Roast ($23.99) is a thick and tomato cream base soup.  You can also choose the degree of spiciness in the soup base.  They will cook it right in front of you and it usually takes at least 10 mins.  The combo comes with fresh lobster, shrimp, and crab meat and they give you a lot of seafood too  I usually share this since this entire is very rich and heavy.  I am always craving for this entry and will consider this one of my favorite seafood dish.     The server is very friendly and are fast with their service.  They do accept credit card too.  If you have never been here before, you gotta come and check it out at least once.  It's a hidden gym worth coming for since you will never find another restaurant similar to this.",

We got combo pan roast level 4, which was perfect for me because I have a weak taste bud for spicy foods. It was super delicious. Ask for an extra scoop of rice and it is the perfect amount for sharing. =)  The chef was awesome but the other servers were lacking. He was supposed to be the one refilling our drinks, but it was the chef who was refilling our drinks and cooking the food. So KUDOS to the chef for awesome multitasking while keeping a positive attitude under the pressure. =)  Definitely will make this a usual spot when I visit Vegas.  PS. For southern california residents, they do have a place called the boiler in chino hills, which is not as good but comparable if your having a craving.",

I've had a couple different things on the menu but the one dish I would recommend to everyone (even non seafood eaters) is the Pan roast.    I'm not sure how to explain the Pan Roast.  It's just a blended creamy soup of goodness.  Usually I would just ask for chicken and sausage but even the seafood Pan Roast isn't fishy at all.  If you don't like spicy food don't go past 5 on a scale of 10... you'll regret it when you're at a strip joint in the wee hours of the night.    This place is located in the not so fabulous Palace station and can only accommodate about 15 to 20 people.  Be prepared to wait.  I would recommend coming right before lunch hours to minimize the wait.  Oh yea if you buy a large beer, you can keep the glass... just a nice little souvenir since you probably won't have any money left to buy anything.  Overall this place is amazing... you can't really find anything like it in Orange county.  It's a perfect hangover food and totally worth the trip.  There are no tigers, cirque shows, naked chicks dancing, etc... Oyster bar in Palace station is the main attraction!",

There is a long wait to get seated since it's just a small bar that can hold up to 12-15 people... and the food does take a while to cook, but once you get to eat your yummy bowl of gumbo, you realize it was worth the wait... At least that's how I feel hehe :D I haven't tried the rest of the menu, cuz I'm too much in luv with the gumbo, but I hear it's all pretty yummy :)",

    "text": "For all you donkeys out there that can't count, quit miss informing our fellow yelpers.  There is a total of \"18\" stools at the Oyster Bar and there are \"6\" cooking kettles.  This bar is designed to sit \"6\" people down at a time, but that is not always the case when there are larger parties wanting to sit together or you have your typical slow eaters and chin waggers.  I have been coming here for over 12 years and know this place inside and out.  Not a place to socialize and sit around for drinks after dinner.  The Oyster Bar's motto is; get in line, wait to be seated, order, eat, pay your tab and leave.  Last time I was there the manager had to tell a group of 4 to leave after they had  been sitting at the bar for over 2 hours and were just being social and having wine after dinner.  They were totally oblivious to the 50 hungry people who were waiting in line to be seated.  As they were starting to leave the people waiting in line started cheering and clapping.  I won't get into the colorful language they used as they departed.  So for those of you who have never been here before and for those of you who continue to return for the excellent food, just remember the hungry people waiting in line for your seat.  Just a courtesy reminder.",

I used to go there after a late night bar tending shift every time i was in the mood for something warm and comforting with a great seafood flavors. The staff is surprisingly warm and energetic despite the amount of work they have to do. They just don't stop because they can't stop cranking out to feed all the hungry people.",

    "text": "4 stars based on the food.  Actually, I have only tried the Seafood Pan Roast. And the dinner rolls are yummy too! There is only about 15-20 seats around this bar and no other seating. Sometimes the waiting line is so long since seating is limited. Definitely not good for large groups, and I personally do not like it when there is a large group ahead of me.  The 2nd time I was there, there was about 3 parties ahead of us and the group right in front of us was a party of 7. But there was only 2 people in line for the 7 people. That made me angry! You can't take a number and leave, you need to wait in the line to be seated. But whatever, for the most part, it was worth the wait. We waited about 1 hour to be seated.  The food does take a little while too, but you see them make it right in front of you. The first time I went, I was BLOWN AWAY by the food. It was about $20-$25 for the entree, but its a big portion. The other items seemed delicious too. Definitely need to go back to try the other items.  The Pan Roast is apparently a very exclusive thing and you can't really find the recipe online. We ended up buying a mock recipe from a guy, doesn't taste the same, but I actually liked our recipe more than the one here. So the 2nd time we went back, not as amazing, but still GREAT!  Service wise, not the best, but it is just a bar. The server isn't super nice or anything, but still efficient. Definitely somewhere everyone should try at least once! I think late lunch/early dinner is best time to go without much of a wait.",

    "text": "I have been here bunches of times, but haven't written anything till now. We ate there on Monday and arrived at 6:30 p.m., we waited in line for 3 long hours before we got seated. By the time we were seated and our food served, we had gobbled up the bread and divided amongst the 4 of us a ceaser's salad. When our crab pan roast arrived, it was love at first bite yet, again and I sort of forgot I waited 3 darn long hours to eat it, yeah right.   Anyway, I refer people visiting here to make this an absolute must stop. Each person raves how wonderful their experience was and make this part of their stops on their future trips to Vegas.  Afterall, you can't gamble the whole time there,everyone needs to stop and eat and this place is unique and different and a delight for any palette. Cost is about $20.00 for a decent sized bowl, served with a generous scoop of rice. Don't forget to tell them how spicy you want it. On a scale of 1 through 10, I chose a 6 and it wasn't too spicy. I think the next time I go, I'll choose an 8 and hopfully it'll have a good kick, but not too much, where I wouldn't be able to enjoy it...............  Oh, and if you love oysters on the half shell, then this is your place. I'm not an oyster lover per say, buy I see a ton of people enjoying themselves.  If you've never been here before, too bad for you.........  They now open 24 hours, so next time we go, we're eating off hours to avoid those dreadful long lines.  Till next time, happy eating!",

The first time I had the seafood pan roast at Oyster Bar, I thought: Hmm, amazingly well cooked, strong flavors, quite delicious, but too bold and rich for me to return. Little did I know, OB had worked its spell on me. I find myself craving this pan roast in the early mornings..late at night..when I'm dining on other things o.O. Darn you Oyster Bar for making me want mooore.  Since then, I've revisited and had the Jambalaya (abundant) and the Gumbo (prettttyyy good as well). I've also tried the clam chowder (SF does it better) and the oysters (briny, refreshing, but kinda dinky). No doubt, the shining star is the pan roast. I am currently counting down to my next helping..mmm..nommm....  I'm fortunate enough to be a temporary local, so wait times are not too bothersome for me, but coming at odd hours is highly recommended as their bar seats no more than 14. The bar is attached to the Broiler so look for that on all the Palace Station signs as OB isn't even labeled o.O. Waitress and cook are a hoot. Awesome service and amazing food. I can't wait til my next Vegas guests come so that I can drag them here with me.",

I kind of worried that the reviews may have over-hyped it, but nope. I can honestly say that the pan roast is absolutely delicious!  But, I did like the clam chowder a lot more. As someone else mentioned, it wasn't too salty like other clam chowders tend to be - it was extremely flavorful and just perfect. That's right, perfect. My BH had some oysters and said they were tasty as as well. We had beers with our meal and got to keep the beer glass for half price refills in the future.  I know they say the line gets really long, but we lucked out! We went on a Friday at around 3 PM and all the seats were filled (about 18 or so; it's an ACTUAL bar) but we were the first in line and only waited like five minutes. Our server was awesome! Very attentive and just a really friendly person.     Overall, this is just one of those rare gems that you have to experience on your own to really understand its awesomeness (is that a word?)!!  Oh and PS there's a spiciness level of 1 - 10 for the Pan Roast. We got a 7 and it was pretty damn spicy. The man eating next to us got a 6 and was sweating the whole time he was eating so I would say start low and just add some sauce if you want it spicier.",

Go grab a Smithwicks from the Irish Pub across the way, then wait it out for a seat at the altar of New Orleans grub in LV.  It has become a tradition, nay, pilgrimage, to this Mecca of deliciousness that is the ominously titled \"Oyster Bar\" at the Palace Station. Station Casinos are known to cater to locals, and locals and returning visitors know this spot is dope. I met a professional concierge, not native to U.S., let alone LV,  who recommends this joint to only her highest clientele.  Wait, sit, order, wait, indulge. I also STRONGLY recommend the Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters (3 for $10 or 1 for $4).   SERIOUSLY. This gumbo is UNREAL! And the staff is on point, amiable, and accommodating, given the cramped nature of this small bar in a casino. Would eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight snack if possible.",

As mentioned in my previous review, do not come here when it's busy! There are only few seats, so come at odd hours.  (I have waited about an hour for group of 6 at 5 AM).  Just goes to show you how popular this place is.  I'd recommend the Pan Roast, level 3 or 4 spicy.  And definitely recommending sharing this, unless you have a fridge to put the left overs in.  And just add on the extra scoop or two of rice.  Oysters, clams are all fresh and yummy!  And don't go to other Oyster Bar in Vegas if you are going for the Pan Roast.  The other places do not do this.  This is the only location.  Also don't expect stellar service.  It's more like a diner service with food you'll drool over in your sleep.",

This place is a counter where they shuck the oysters right in front of you and cook everything right in front of you with really awesome, high powered steam cookers. The prices are fantastic for Vegas too - $17 for a dozen oysters - NICE!  Starting with the service, Sandra was our waitress, and she was fabulous. She had plenty of suggestions about what to get. We already knew we wanted a dozen oysters, but we weren't sure what to follow that up with. She suggested the combo roast, and we went for it. FREAKING DELICIOUS. In fact, if you're going as a twosome, I think a dozen oysters, a couple beers, and a combo roast is a great meal to share for the two of you.  Apparently this place has been around for 19 years.  Do you really need my review to convince you? There are well over 200 reviews of this place, and the average score is 4.5 stars. I think if we would have waited two hours, my review would have only been four stars, but considering that we had no wait, five stars all the way.  Next time I'm in town, this place is HIGH on my list!",

I asked the guy waiting in line in front of me if he had been here before and he said that he comes here every time he is in town. He said he always get the pan roast w/crab and lobster. Him and his wife even moved to the other side of the bar so me and my +4 could sit together. Thank you awesome couple from Cali!!  You have to be 21 to eat here and you're limited to 1 pan roast per person and no take-out. The 2 couples each shared 1 and I got 1 all to myself!! The other 2, we had them box it up for my aunt n uncle (the sneaky way to still get take-out, which was suggested by our waitress). We got 4 combo pan roasts (lobster, crab, and shrimp) and 1 palace pan roast (i can't remember what is in it) with our rice on the side. I got mine at level 7 spicy, which was perfect for me.   They have these crazy looking steamers that cook each pan roast right in front of you. I think it cooks for about 10 minutes. It was everything I expected, except that an extra order of rice was $2.49.",

    "text": "Amazingly Good Food and Very Good Service.  Value for your Money, absolutely !  The Oyster Bar is off the strip, about 2-miles from the Venetian/Palazzo inside the Palace Station Hotel & Casino.   The restaurant only seats about 18-20, we waited about 30-mintues for a place at the bar to open.  My wife and I had 2-dozen oysters, the oysters that day were from \"Watch Point - Virginia\" right out of the Chesapeake Bay...nice, they were absolutely GREAT !  Priced about $17 per doz.  We also had the Combo Pan Roast (lump crab, shrimp, and lobster) in a creamy tomato sauce.  We only ordered one, we spit the Combo Pan Roast with Rice, it was large enough for the both of us, priced about $20.   The pan roast is really hard to describe, seafood cooked in clam broth (the cook took a ladle of water from a clam pot, and used it to cook the seafood he added garlic, (this is right in front of us). The seafood cooked for several minutes, and then he finished the dish with a couple of ladle's of a tomato cream sauce, there was some brandy or sweet vermouth in that sauce.  If you've had tomato basil soup from La Madeleine, that's what the tomato base looks/taste like, sort of.      You also tell the chef, how spicy you'd like your dish spicy-level, 1-10.   They also serve a nice selection of draft beers, we had 0.5 liter Kirin drafts....and we got to keep the glasses, nice !  0.5 liter/23-oz drafts @ $5....oh, man \"is this heaven, no its Las Vegas\".  Afterwards, played 5 games of keno before heading back to the Palazzo to grab a beer at the Public House, a great beer place !  The filipino chef was a hoot, very funny guy, having fun with the crowd....sorry I don't remember his name, nor do I remember our server's name, she was also great, very attentive, hard working, and very nice, all and all a fun time.  Lots of great places in Las Vegas off the strip, ya just got to do a little research.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try the Oyster Bar for a long time after seeing it on Yelp. It was Wednesday evening around 7:00 pm and I lucked out and waited only 10 minutes for the perfect seat. I was seated in the middle of the bar which gave me the perfect view of the chef creating all his southern style entrees.   I ordered the combo pan roast which has lobster, crab and shrimp simmered in a thick stew like liquid with a scoop of steamed rice added in. The stew is great for dipping your bread in. I enjoyed the dish but wished the lobster and crab was not cooked to disintegration and left no chunks of lobster or crab although the stew flavor was awesome. The size is very large and went great with a tall imported beer.   My neighbor next to me had the jambalaya and that looked yummy and he ate everything. I checked out the trays of oysters on the half shell and they looked very fresh and were pretty large too.   When I departed there was a line of about ten people so I advise getting there early. Here is the full menu that you can check out.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.palacestation.com%2Fdining%2Foyster-bar%2Fmenu.pdf&s=845d0bca2a3840be8c56d8e72085baed5121dd80cd50ca4b16af3b165e18369c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">palacestation.com/dining...</a>",

I thought the service and setting was neat and with only 1 chef and 1 waitress, I thought they did a pretty good job with the service.  I also loved the draft beer selection.  The food wasn't as mind blowing as the yelp reviews would lead you to believe.  We tried a few different things and here is my rating on each: Oyster Vodka Shooter 2/5 - Lousy bloody mary mix. New Zealand Mussels 2/5 -the liquid was weak and watery but the mussels were fresh and tasty.  The bland liquid ruined it for me. 1/2 Dozen Oysters 5/5 - AWESOME, I will go back just for these.  Huge and fresh. Combo Pan Roast 4/5 - The seafood was cooked perfectly, but the flavor was missing just a little something for me. Shrimp Scampi 2/5 - Shrimp was beautiful but the sauce was unbearably weak.  This may be the worst scampi I have ever had.  I am hoping to go back when there is a different chef and maybe the food will be more flavorful.",

There were only three workers who were all pleasant and helpful. I ordered the linguine and clams which was very good but my only complaint was that it was a bit soupy.  My wife ordered the Diablo dish which she really liked but it was way too much food. If we had a hotel with a kitchen it would have made a nice meal the next day. I think they would make twice as much money if they expanded but maybe part of the appeal is the coziness of the place? I doubt if they could increase staff because the work area is so small. Anyway, great place but I had to take off a star just because of the long wait.",

But I decided to get the gumbo instead. Omg, it's the best gumbo I've ever tasted. Everything is made fresh, and right in front of you. It's an intimate spot, and a great experience.  I totally underestimated this place at first, but now I totally get why this place is so high in demand. I still wouldn't wait 3-4 hours for it. I'd rather go really early to avoid it.

    "text": "I can't believe I almost didn't try this place.   We had gone to Bacchanal the night before and I had more than gotten my oyster fix.  We were in town to watch the Kings battle the Avalanche at MGM and the game ended up going into a shootout. Needless to say, we were pretty hungry at that point, but didn't want to eat anything we would regret the next morning. I perused my bookmarks and the boyfriend thought Oyster Bar was the most benign choice.   First off, this place is literally a bar. The maximum occupancy is probably right at 12 people. The menu is concise, which helps with the efficiency of the turnover rate. We were the third party in line and waited approximately 45 minutes. Let me tell you that the wait is worthwhile. I've waited over 2 hours to get ciopino in San Francisco, so this was a cake walk.   The bar is really unique. The 2 chefs prepare everything in front of you. There are maybe 6 cooking stations- big metal pots where they cook the dishes to order. And you get to enjoy yummy smells from all the pots.   The boyfriend started off with a half dozen raw oysters, which were shucked by our server. They were huge and fresh, according to him. We decided to split a ciopino. Split charges are $5. The serving size was decent. I could have easily polished it off on my own, but it was late and I didn't want to overstuff myself. We had an option for rice or pasta? which we thought was a little strange. We politely declined both (we also didn't see the $5 split charge on the bill. It may be because we skipped the starch side?) Once the ciopino came out, we understood why pasta was an option. The soup portion was hearty, much like a pasta sauce. It was rich and flavorful and the seafood was cooked to absolute perfection.   I will definitely be back. I'd love to try the raw sampler platter and one of the stews. Those are made with a tomato and cream base and smelled amazing when the chef was cooking it in front of us.",

You can watch the chef cook for you in these interesting pots! There's a total of 16 seats at the bar, and it would not be a good idea for big groups. Unless you're willing to split into little groups.  I woke up early enough to go and there was no line. The regulars informed me that the wait is usually 2-3 hours during peak hours, so it's a lengthy wait for lunch and dinner.  Each portion is huge! Keep in mind that you're going to take the leftovers home! They served many different dishes, which I haven't tried it all yet. I ordered the seafood jambalaya for $23.99!  They take card and cash.. and oh, they also serve some alcoholic drinks.",

We also ordered the combo pan roast (lobster, crab, shrimp) with level spiciness of 8. and the Alaskan clam chowder level spice at 6. Both dishes were amazing!  the dishes came with white jasmine rice however I prefer the sourdough bread. Hope this helps remember to #eatlikethegods thanks",

I didn't drive so I didn't care where he was taking me.  This is an oyster bar, it has a bar set up, therefore you have to be 21+ years old. The wait line is kinda awkward cause it's by the rewards center and slot machines. The wait was about hour to hour and half. Yup, line was long. I had a couple beers while waiting. Yeah, I got drunk. But hey, at least I remembered what I ordered.  Ordered the shooters which was 3 for $10. If you got vodka, they add a bloody mary mix. Spicy, lemony, oystery, and vodka-y. For main dish, ordered the lobster gumbo with level 7 spiciness. They start cooking your food right in front of you. You will start tearing up because you're so hungry. The bottom line to the dishes is that it was AMAZEBALLS. Spiciness was perfect. Amount of lobster and sausage...yum!  Service was good. You can tell that the chef loves his job. Watching him cook was like watching a T.V. show. There are two other servers and they will get you other things (water, beer, or more oysters).  Will come back again! But I wil have one of my friends to stand in line for me. Must stop for some New England/Southern/Seafood food.",

It is certainly an interesting dining concept in the middle of a sea of slot machines. I had a half dozen oysters and a half dozen clams and my partner had the Alaskan chowder, it was all fresh and delicious. Chowder had huge chunks of seafood, and was probably the best chowder I've ever tasted    We definitely got lucky with the seating, as we went at about 7 a.m. on a Wednesday and we were the only ones there. I only wish we had more time and I could have tried other items on the menu, especially the $70 seafood special for 2, which we didn't notice on the digital display screen until after we ordered. Definitely will go back on our next visit to Vegas.",

There's only about 15-18 seats around this 24-hour bar and so be prepared for a 30 - 90 minute wait no matter what time of day or night.  I love the Pan Roast or Combo Roast there.  Pan Roast includes generous servings of shrimp, crab, lobster, chicken and andullie sausage.  Then they add in a creamy tomato based soup.  They boil this right in front of you in a pot attached to a steam line.  Once it comes to a boil, it is poured over a bowl of rice.....YUM!  Don't eat raw oysters but this is also a popular item.  Calm Chowder looks awesome too and I may have to venture out on my next visit.  Of all the many choices and celebrity chefs, this small little hole in the wall is still in my top five!",

The wait will probably be about an hour+ so I suggest that you plan accordingly and come when you aren't too hungry (although the wait should help).  I was able to try the soups: Gumbo, Alaskan Clam Chowder, and Pan Roast with my group. The soups were all great to me! Different flavor for each one, but all special in their own way. You will spend about 20 bucks for a big bowl that will absolutely fill you up and get your taste buds going. They are full of the meat of your choice: lobster, shrimp, sausages, chicken, or other seafood combinations (really though, they are very generous with the amount of meat you will get).  They have a special price on beers and oysters past 1am. They oysters are not small and yummy as well!  The service was pleasant despite that their bar only has about 18 seats. They will chuck the oysters in front of you so you know they are fresh. For a business that is open 24 hours, they know how to keep it live.  What's awesome is that you can take the leftover soup home, heat it up the next day, and it's still good!",

One thing I really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location. The casino cigarette smell is very strong and almost unbearable.  Our group came here in a weeknight, there is only two group before us but the waiting was over 30 minutes long.  There are maybe around 20 seating at top of that the cooking expect to take another 20 or 30 minutes.  The bar setting is a kitchen like those in a ramen shop except you can see the whole kitchen.  Food was careful prepare and you see they not rushing make your food and really take their time and not to avoid short cuts.  Pan Roast and some other dish there is a charge of $5 extra per person if the food is been shared, and you cannot do takeout either.  However, you can take back the food if can't finish it.  They gave you dining roll, which are warm and soft.  We only order two item, one is the full serving of Oyster and the second one is the Combo Pan Roast.  The oyster was fresh and mouthwatering, juicy and you can really tasted the flavor.  It was day and night quality compare to the oyster found in Bacchanal Buffet. The Pan Roast was delicious and was well balance in term of the soup; it wasn't heavily tomato flavor, the soup come with lobster, crab, and shrimp.  There was little bit of lobster meat, and decent amount of crab, but the shrimp won me over, it was good quality.    The price is far cheaper than the Harrah location but with more limited selection.  What it matter is the quality of food is not compromise here.  So if you are tired of eating of buffet, this would gave you a totally different taste bud.  Just aware expect a wait and the atmosphere is not as pleasant.",

But that is not worthy of decreasing the stars on the review bc it is worth the wait. Not many restaurants are worth a wait but this place is. We got there around 4pm and waiting about 1 hour to sit (2 of us). There are only 18 stools that sit around the bar. You have an awesome view of the cook and can watch him create all the delish dishes. We started with 1/2 dozen oysters (shucked to order) and lump crab cocktail. Next time I will skip the lump crab cocktail-not that great. We split the etoufee with a 4 spice rating. You can pick 1-10 of how spicy you want your dishes. It was SOOOO GOOD!!! I saw some other people order the Pan Roasts which looked amazing too. I can't wait to head back here to try other dishes.

    "text": "The food here was awesome!  After hearing rave reviews about this place from a fellow co-worker, we headed to this place located inside of Palace Station, on our last trip to Vegas. Despite all the hype that we heard, this place really delivered.   They really weren't kidding when they said it's an oyster bar. It literally is a bar that seats about 20 people total. As a result, you will probably have to wait unless you want to take your food to-go. I think we waited about 40 minutes to get seated (party of 5), on a Saturday afternoon (around 1ish, I believe).   All of us had the Combo Pan Roast (since that's what was recommended to us) with varying levels of spiciness. My co-workers got 3, 5, & 7, while I had an 8 which I thought was perfect (but be warned, I like really spicy foods and my co-workers who had their 7s thought it was a bit too spicy already). The food was great. Our chef, Ricardo cooked the Pan Roasts in little pots in front of us, so you can see how fresh everything was. It's kind of a tease though, because you watch your food cook in front of you and all the wonderful aromas bubble in your face for about 20 minutes while you can't eat it yet. haha... If you like oysters, they shuck them in front of you was well. The lobster was succulent, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the sauce itself was to die for! Portions are also very generous, although we had to get a couple extra scoops of rice, since 1 is really not enough.   We also got creme brulee for dessert, which was awesome for only $5 and Ricardo was nice enough to get us extra strawberries from the kitchen. We averaged about $30/per person by the end of the meal, which isn't too bad...  I would really recommend this place if you are ever in Vegas. Although it is off the strip, and there was quite a wait, it was definitely worth it. I'm glad we came here and I'm sure I'll be returning again in the near future. You just really need to have patience. By the way, when we left at about 3:30pm there was still a line for this place...",

We went a little after midnight on a Saturday thinking there wouldn't be a wait a little later, but we were wrong. Maybe because it was a weekend, who knows. We ended up waiting an hour or so. We ordered the clam steamer appetizer, which was good. My boyfriend ordered the bouillabaisse & I had the combo pan roast. Both were delicious. The pan roast is rich & a little heavy, the bouillabaisse is lighter. It depends what you want, but anything you get will be delicious!",

My dish du jour everytime is the *Pan Roast* (sorry, let me wipe my Pavlovian drool at the thought of this amazing concoction). I love sloopy saucy dishes and this pan roast is packed with so much flavor! Although the restaurant/bar is located out in the open randomly in the middle of the casino floor of the Palace Station Casino, you'll be lost in the ginormous bowl of pan roast. I always have leftovers for another full meal and the servers are nice to pack up extra bread to help slop up the saucy pan roast.",

And, I like that you can choose how spicy you like it, from 1 - 10.     I've never been displeased eating here.  The one downside, which is why I rank it 4 stars, is that the line / wait can be quite long.  It would be nice if they expanded this place.  I would probably eat here more often, if I knew I wouldn't have to wait for a while!  I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, for that reason.  That said - if your in the mood for seafood and have the time, the wait is well worth it.  The food is awesome! :-)",

It's located off the strip, which is a total drag if you don't rent a car ( we all know the cab drivers LOVE to rip people off).   When we arrived, there was a max 15 minute wait but keep in mind there are only about 10 seats available, it's literally a bar. The oysters are good and shared the combo roast. Let's just say, one roast is PLENTY for two. You can either get it with pasta or rice, I highly suggest the rice! If you are with a group of 3 or more, I suggest ordering the clam chowder too!   I am a huge fan and highly suggest that you go there!",

Besides the 1 hr+ wait, we don't have any complaints about Oyster Bar.  We ordered a dozen of oysters as appetizers which were extremely fresh and clean. Their tartar sauce gave the oyster just the right amount of flavoring. My boyfriend ordered the Boulibase while I got the Lobster Pan Roast. The chef will actually make these spicy for you, giving it even more spice! The Boulibase was filled with large chunks of crab, lobster, shrimp, clams, fish, you name it! The Pan Roast is still my favorite though. It's a perfect combo of Cajun spice, creamy tomato sauce, and a generous portion of lobster chunks. It's a must-try at this place! Make sure to order the rice separate if you are planning to share. One portion or \"bowl\" is enough to fill up any hungry stomach.  We're excited to come back here again. Now that they're open 24 hours, I can't wait to dodge the lines and get some great food.",

    "text": "First, the good - the Pan Roast is amazingly good, and the service is friendly and efficient.  Now the bad - the LONG wait, and the inability and unwillingness of the Palace Station to improve things.  I understand that this is a bar with limited seating, but several things can be done to make the customer experience better.  Do we (or our representatives) really need to stand in a line?  How about investing a few dollars in those electronic devices that buzz when its your turn, or if you don't want to spend the money, how about just writing the name down on a piece of paper?  If I don't have to stand in line, where do you think I'm going to go? Thats right, I'm going to be gambling at those slot machines that surround the bar and likely make the Palace Station some money.  But no, according to a Palace Station staff member, the management likes the lines and has no interest in improving things.  And lastly, some tips: 1. Call ahead to see how long you will have to wait 2. Go during off-peak times, and remember 1 AM is not off-peak in Las Vegas 3. If you get sick and tired of standing in line, like we did, go to the Grand Cafe. 4. Watch out for those pesky representatives - one person in line in front of you could actually be holding a spot for a large group of people.",

So I always make it a goal to come to Palace Station Oyster Bar every time I'm in Vegas. The wait is always long because it's a small bar with minimal seating but it is superrr worth it. Just make sure you go with people who you don't mind waiting a long time in line with. Also, it is a bar, so make sure you bring your ID because you have to be 21 to sit there! The combo pan roast is by far the best thing on the menu!",

    "text": "All four of my friends go the Pan Roast-- and it was very good! Pan Roast is not a \"roast\" it literally is like a stew or thick soup. In this case, they mix A TON of seafood in it. There's different combinations that you can choose from. The only thing is they ask how spicy you want it. I told them a 4 out of a 10, 10 being very spicy and my Pan Roast came out VERY spicy. Note that I can tolerate spicy foods fairly okay- I eat Korean spicy food on a regular basis and I love Indian curries. Later, I thought about it and I think the dish naturally has a kick to it, so if you don't really want it to be spicy, you should say \"mild\" because that might just equal \"medium.\" Also, despite the awesome food, the wait is simply insane. We waited 2.5 hrs in a line that didn't appear that long. One of my friends actually got sick because I think she ended feeling very tired and hungry after such a long day plus the wait. So make sure you take that into account when you're waiting at the Oyster Bar!!",

    "text": "SO GOOD. This is my new favorite place in Vegas!! Our party of 5 got there around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and we waited a good 1.5 hours for seats at the 18-person bar. It was definitely worth it though. Small menu, but everything sounds delicious.  BF and I shared a half dozen oysters, a combo pan roast, and a cup of clam chowder. The oysters were huge, fresh, and clean tasting. The cocktail sauce provided was perfect. The pan roast was soooo comforting and hit the spot, even on a hot day (thank goodness for a/c). The combo comes with lobster, crab, and shrimp, and I had trouble telling what was what, except for the obvious huge shrimp. Next time I'd try the lobster one just so I could enjoy that single flavor. It comes with a scoop of rice (2 if you're sharing - $5 sharing fee) and it just makes it that much heartier. We seriously considered going back the next morning for one more bowl before driving home. Finally, the clam chowder was also delicious - bite-sized pieces of clam and potato (not sure if there was bacon? but it didn't need it, if there wasn't) and perfectly creamy soup without feeling like it's laden with cream and butter. It almost felt light, if that is even possible. Add a dash of Tabasco and you will slurp that up like there's no tomorrow. I also tried a bite of the gumbo and it was super salty -- you definitely need to eat that with rice or add pasta.  I hear there's a similar location (same owner) in Santa Ana, so I'm excited to try that, but I've been warned that it's not as good. But, whenever I'm back in Vegas, I'll make it a point to come here and get some pan roast!",

I do wish you could order liquor but considering how busy it is there I understand there's only so much they can do. Oyster shooters are a must! 5 stars because the customer service, flavor, and food were all top notch. I wish it could be bigger, but its a BAR afterall.",

I've eaten here before but it was many years ago and I have been wanting to eat the clam linguine from here for a while. When we were finally seated, I ordered the New England clam chowder and the linguine and clams with a 2 heat (spice). Mike had the New England clam chowder and the Palace Pan Roast with a 6 heat (spice). They serve a sourdough bun with your order. I really liked the bun (with butter) and asked for more. The clam chowder was good too. Of course my FAVORITE was the linguine with clams. Mike's Palace Pan Roast was also good, although I would've liked more rice to go with it. Yes, I ate some of his food too :)",

The chowder was filled with crab, clams, mussels, and shrimp. It was good and so filling. We shared the one bowl and the cocktail because I don't eat much but it is a perfect size for one person without leaving you hungry. Will go again",

My only drawback was the cook coming from the back into prep area visible to all seated at bar, opened and dumped bagged seafood into his stainless steel containers.  At least maintain the illusion of freshness and open the bags in the back where nobody can see.  If you walk by and there is no line, dive in and enjoy.  Alaskan Chowder was AWESOME!

    "text": "Did someone say that Oysters makes you STRONG like a BULL? Yes, I said it! The Oyster Bar may just be the best kept secret in Sin City. I have been coming here for over 10 years and the food is AMAZING. When I started coming here there was never a line but now you will have to probably have to wait at least an hour to get seated. So my advice to you all is to get here right when it opens or you'll be waiting for a while especially during the weekend. These New Orleans Chefs are Freaking Hilarious....Bob (noon shift) and JJ (night shift). They will have you rolling the whole time. I always start off with a dozen Oysters. They have the freshest oysters in town and I guarantee that it will melt in your mouth. I have tried everything on the menu. So here are my recommendations:  #1 Bouillabaisse - My all time FAVORITE. This is a classic french dish made with tomato, saffron, wine, garlic, leeks, and seafood including crab, cod, prawns, lobster, mussels, and clams. Since, I am naturally HOT, I get my Bouillabaisse at a spicy level of 7.  #2 Palace Pan Roast is their top selling dish.  #3 House Gumbo - Tasty Creole chowder with seafood, sausage, and okra.  #4 Linguini with Shrimp Scampi - Made to perfection.  The price ranges from $15-$22. You have the option to have rice or linguini (extra charge) with your soup. Also, they will ask you how spicy you want it. So choose your number wisely! If you ordering a frosty beverage make sure to keep the glass. The next time you come back and trust you'll be back... the beer will be 1/2 price.  I have tried all these dishes but I am truly in love with my Bouillabaisse. If this place is good for OJ Simpson then it's good for me. \"If your pants splits then you are in BLISS!!",

However, for all of you who are less than enthusiastic about seafood, but have a partner, friend, spouse or parental who adores the stuff, be warned: If you try to make their wildest pan roast dreams come True, you will be making a culinary sacrifice. When you sit at the bar, you will be eating seafood and/or salad.   Important note: If you are with a group, and some of your group wants to gamble while you selflessly wait in the long ass line on a Friday night, they can run off and play. When you reach the front of the line, they can come back and join you.   Also note, that everyone in my group who consumed the pan roast looked like they were inhaling something close to ecstasy. They didn't seem bothered by the 40-minute Friday night wait or the $20 price tag.   Personally, I had a Caesar salad and a cup of clam chowder. If you're a dressing lover, you will adore the salad. It is huge and drenched in some tasty dressing. For me, it was a bit rich and overwhelming, but still a generous, well-executed Caesar. As for my clam chowder, the flavor was perfect, but there was sand in the clams. Not so enjoyable.   Still, I am going to stick with the 4-stars because I do believe if you're a seafood lover, you should take a chance with the Oyster Bar at least once.",

I needed to do a pre-race carb load Saturday night so I pulled into the parking lot of the Palace Hotel (off the strip) to see what all the fuss was about. The Oyster Bar is located smack dab on the casino floor between the slot area and table games. Seating is \"bar style\" around an open kitchen area. There was a considerable wait on a Saturday night (30-40 mins) and it is a first come first serve basis. If you are looking for a taste of New Orleans off the Vegas strip this is indeed your place! Etoufees, gumbos and jambalayas prepared to your desired degree of spiciness. I went with the Jambalaya to fully capture my craving for all of the seafood options. I definitely recommend and would revisit!",

The oysters are very fresh and they have several specialty variations. The restaurant is small but joined to a bar who can mix up any drink you fancy, I suggest the mojito.",

I tried a variety of things on the menu since I went with a few of my friends and tried everyone's dish.  Everything is good but the \"Combo Pan Roast:\" is THE BOMB!  By the way if you get above spicy level 6-7 it will literally be the bomb.  It gets SUPER SPICY.  I think it just depends on your cook.  I had 6 Pan Roast with one cook and it was good.  Not too spicy.  Then I had the exact same thing again with another cook and it was spicy. Tried 7 and was like whoa.. I can't imagine what 10 tastes like...  I think I'll always just stick with 6.    Anyways, its open 24 hours.  It gets quite packed and up to 2 hour wait especially during dinner time.  After 2am it seems ok and in the mornings it seemed ok so plan ahead and don't be hungry if you are going during peak time or you will be unhappy waiting.  By the way for those of you who are in socal wanting this we have an alternative!!!!  I didn't know but my gf found out from the cook that a ex cook partnered up with someone and opened one in Chino Hills called, \"The Boiler\"!  Yay!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theboilerskc.com%2F&s=f6071e800b19f34894141e90ded9529cd8ec955ccbcbb15d794a7f324949665a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">theboilerskc.com</a>  Chino Hills here we come!!!",

Everything is really fresh and they cook the pan roasts right in front of you, it's pretty much a giant lobster bisque with jasmine rice on the side. The service ranges from greatest to surly, and is always pretty fast. It's the only reason I'd ever step foot into Palace Station, that's for sure.",

I highly recommend that you try everything off their menu. I was a little too tipsy to remember the whole meal but from the start my friends and I ordered:  -pan roast ( thick & creamy filled with combination of seafood and a scoop of rice) -Jambalaya (nice hint of spice and filled with mussels) - Gumbo (can't go wrong with this dish either) -Oyster shots (2 tequila & 1 vodka shooter) -Dozen raw oysters   Every dish that we had was delicious! The serving size was enough to feed two people per dish but you'll want to order your own and like most asians, make it family style to share! Prices are not too steep but well worth it for the amount you get. Don't leave vegas til you've tried this joint!",

Sometimes that line will just be wrapped around and there are so few seats at the bar, you'd guess you wouldn't be eating until tomorrow. Then, of course, at no fault to the restaurant, there are people dillydallying when there's an entire line of people waiting to sit down after they've finished eating. *Sigh* The things we do for good food. Like I said, the food is phenomenal. I am a huge fan. The oysters are SUPER fresh, surprisingly! But I really only go for the combo/\"Palace\" pan roast. What is it? I can't quite describe what a pan roast is, but it's a mind-blowing \"stew\"-type thing that, in the combo/\"Palace\", you'll have shrimp, lobster, andouille sausage (add for extra $5) and you can make it as spicy as you want. Truly delicious comfort food. I could go for it over and over again. I have yet to try other items on the menu because I can't stray from the pan roast. You've got to try it. Dare I say--WORTH THE WAIT.",

    "text": "This review is based purely on the service (or lack there of).   We came on a Tuesday night at 9 and the line was 20 deep (ended up being a 90 minute wait). Our friends came the night before around 10PM and it was 6 people deep and they waited 30 minutes. Its really hit of miss in terms of when you go and how long the line is. After we were finally seated after our 90+ minute wait, we quickly ordered and didn't need to see the menu, since we had been studying it for a long time.  We ordered a dozen oysters and the combo pan roast. We knew the pan roast would take time and so the oysters would have to hold us over. Plus the last time we came the wifey was pregnant and she didn't partake in the oysters, so it was a must this time. The oysters never came and we thought it was because they would time it so we didn't get it too early and not to close to the actual pan roast (I guess we gave them too much credit). We finally realized they forgot when others who were seated after us got their oysters (20-30 minutes after we were seated). We quickly commented and the server who forgot was not remorseful at all. She kind of said sorry under her breath and was not genuinely apologetic. We were definitely unhappy about the situation because we had waited in line so long already and now the oysters didn't even come when they were suppose to.  The food was great and the main chef was awesome too.",

Both of us had the combo pan roast and this time everything tasted fresh and it was just as delicious as I remembered it from last year.   The oysters were also super fresh and so delicious.

The last time I came here I got the cherry clams. Sooooooo good. I think it might even be better than the oysters. But don't get me wrong the oysters are fresh as hell and delicious too! Also during my last visit I found a weird object in my pan roast, they figured out that it was starch from the soup base that didn't get incorporated all the way. It was kinda gross lol but good thing this place has awesome customer service! They took it off the bill, as they should. I've been to place where they mess up and don't comp. the dish. -.- our water glasses were least full. No complaints here. YES, the wait can suck, but the food is so worth it!!

Booooooooooyyyyyy am I glad I gave it another shot!  I fell in love at the second encounter!  I ordered a spicy level 10. It was very spicy but still the bomb!  The last time I went I think I got a level 6.  It was still spicy but still soooo good. I can't wait to go again. I'm going to try a level 4. I tried my sister's last order which was a level 3 and I think I wanted it just a tad bit more spicy.  The fun part is figuring out your number!  The oysters are delicious as well!  The wait kinda sucks though.  All times we waited at least an hour. I'm excited to try their new location since it's so close to home!  The portion is enough for my husband and I to have left overs!  The left overs are sometimes even better!  It's like the flavors soak long enough for perfection.   Plus, the customer service is always phenominal!",

I don't like my chowder spicy so I got  a 2 which was perfect, I would say 2 is less than mild. The combo pan roast was also very yummy with chunks of seafood in it too. We got ours spicy level 4 which had a little punch but I would still consider it mild.  We had 3 people and it was more than enough food, they charge a $5 split fee.   The wait was long! Almost 2 hours. We got there at 1015 PM on a Saturday and got seated about 1215 AM. You have to stand in line for to-go orders too.  There is no sign in list, you just have to stand and wait. The food is great tho! I've had equally amazing pan roast at the Kettle Bar at the Anaheim Packing House so not sure if I'd do it again. I've never had better Chowder tho. Vegas has so many great food options so I probably wouldn't do the wait again, but I would recommend everyone trying it once, just be prepared for the line.",

The oysters are actually not too bad as well.",

    "text": "I have heard about this legendary place for a year now and I had the opportunity to check it out on my last trip to Las Vegas. I knew that the lines were going to be long so I decided to check this place out for a brunch opportunity after a night of adult beverages. This joint is located in the Palace hotel and is open 24 hours with bar seating only surrounding the kitchen.  I was fortunate enough to show up at a time where there was no wait and I was seated immediately. They serve a variety of pan roasts, gumbos, a variety of chowders and of course oysters. You may react to the pricetag being high but it is well worth it and the portions are herculean. After a bit of perusing, my company and I decided to order a house gumbo and the palace pan roast. They offer a nice bonus in the ability of selecting the level of spiciness which I took full advantage of.   They cook the gumbos and pan roasts right in front of you with such ease. They literally have multiple pots cooking up deliciousness and they are quick to clean them after serving and then making the next batch. The gumbo consisted of shrimp, crab, and lobster served with a side of rice. The Palace pan roast consists of shrimp, crab, chicken, and sausage with a side of rice. It is amazing how these guys manage all the pots but the end outcome is amazing. The real star of the show is the palace pan roast. It is a thick/creamy delicious tomato soup like concoction. They throw generous portions of seafood in there and what amazed me was the depth of flavor to the meal. The gumbo was delicious and totally different from the pan roast. It is a thicker stew filled with spices and okra with seafood delight. Both are a must gets but I personally like the sweetness of the pan roast slightly better. The portions here are enormous so definitely make sure you have some space in your tummy but not too much in case you have to wait for a bit.   I am excited to have finally had the opportunity to eat at this joint and will be making it one of my stops in every trip to vegas because it is JUST THAT GOOD.",

If you get there and there are 20 people in line in front of you, you are looking at 45 to an hour wait. We got there at 4:30, about 25 people in front of us and we waited 90 minutes.  All of that being said, the food is terrific! My wife and I split the Cold Seafood combo and it was great. We both ordered the Combo Pan Roast for an entree, 5 or 6 out of ten on the spicy meter, and it was spectacular! Loved it! Worth the wait, just make sure you're prepared for the wait.",

I'll stick with the  Seafood Pan Roast with rice, but with the 1.5-2 hour wait, in a smokey environment, I'd rather head over to Shucks and get the equally delicious pan roast with no lines, no smoke fumes.

I also, got the clam chowder and combo pan with a level 8 spicy that I thought was perfect! My friend got 10 and added habanero (he likes spicy) but I think it was too spicy for him to eat haha.

CONS: - Long Lines during peak dining hours  MY EXPERIENCE: If you have read my earlier review on The Buffet at Bellagio, you might have noticed that I stated that it's been a while since I been to an AYCE location in Las Vegas.  And the OYSTER BAR located at PALACE STATION is the reason why I don't go to buffets anymore.  For the same amount of money, I can get something I love and cannot describe myself.  You have to try it out yourself.  My favorite chef at the Oyster Bar is BOB.  Remember... The Oyster Bar only have approximately 16 spots at its counter.  Don't go to the Broiler (the restaurant next to it) because it doesn't serve the same quality of food at the Broiler.  If you go during peak hours, expect to wait in line for 30-60 minutes.  There are plenty of different dishes available at the Oyster Bar, but I always order the following everytime I visit: - 1 dozen of raw Oyster - Combo Pan Roast #7  (shrimp, crab meat, and lobster) - Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters  I have tried their House Gumbo before but think it was a little too salty for me.  The Combo Roast is a tomato based sauce that is sweeter and more to my liking.    OVERALL: I would literally drive to Vegas just to eat this.  I love their Combo Roast!  If I can eat anything as my last meal on earth- This is definitely it!",

Pan roast combo @ level 8 spicy is right on the money! It is kinda pricey though. Looking at $23 for a bowl. If you're going to split it with another person, I recommend paying more for extra meats.

I loved the food!!! Got combo pan roast, oysters and a bottle of moscato. DELICIOUS! !! Food changed my life. The spices,  seafood and rice was all pefect and fresh.   If it wasn't for that line id be there once a week.   I suggest going with another person and take turns waiting in line. Switch off to wait in line and gamble. .. hehe.   If you've never tried oyster bar, its a must. Be prepared to wait. Be patient. I think if you go there mentally prepared to weight, its really not bad.   Yum yum yum!!!",

Yes, it's that good. Do whatever you want in your life, just make sure that if you come here, you order a pan roast and nothing else. Well, you could try other things because variety is the spice of life and all that, but just make sure a pan roast is part of your order. I prefer the combo pan roast.",

    "text": "Who knew about this place and how delicious it would be?!  My bf heard about this place, which is located inside the Palace Station Hotel and Casino, and he really wanted to try it, so we went late one night while in Vegas thinking the wait shouldn't be that bad at around 11pm.  Well, we thought we would be clever and order to go, but you still have to wait in line to do that, so we just opted to eat there if that was the case (kinda lame to have to wait in line for to go though).  The line didn't seem too long (about 3 parties ahead of us) but the place is really small - like diner bar seating only and about 12 seats total.  The wait was about 45 minutes until we finally got seated and we hoped it was worth the wait.  Other people in line were getting antsy and upset about the people sitting there eating and taking their time - dude, chill out!  They probably waited in line just as long as you did if not longer!  Let them enjoy their meal!   Anywho, our server was really nice and friendly despite working for like 12 hours straight.  We ordered the combo pan roast and the new England clam chowder.  We waited awhile to get our food - you see the chef cooking up each dish in their individual pots and it was kinda cool to see.  They give you ample bread rolls and butter to keep you occupied in the meantime.  The pan roast comes with rice that you mix into it and the clam chowder was delicious on it's own or with bread.  Both were really good and well worth the wait!  The bf said the clam chowder was better than Splash Cafe clam chowder!  Gasp!! haha.  It was one of the best new England clam chowders I've had, and the pan roast was different but really good too!  So glad we got to try this place and you know we'll be back next time we're in town!",

Their servings are generous so we split a Greek salad and we each had a bowl of the Alaskan Chowder and were able to select the cayenne level seasoning.  Undoubtably, the food was excellent, excellent, and most excellent in taste!  The hunks of crab, large shrimp, lobster were found in each and every bite.  We were able to have some left to take home, too.   I don't want to forget, the staff was punctual, courteous, and friendly.

    "text": "Is it over rated??? Maybe just a bit but they do have the freshest Oysters!! Located inside Palace Station Casino. A bar that sits about 12-15 people. No one under 21 available. So if you have kids, make sure you send them to the room because along with your wait and time cooking and eating the food, you need minimum 1 1/2 to 2 hrs.   Waiting in line was the worst part! Standing in that line and just walking over to the bar so often to see if people are done with their food yet. :-(  I love their little bar section where you can over sea everything right in front of you! From cooking and cleaning, it's so entertaining!   We ordered a dozen of the fresh oysters along with the clam chowder soup.  If I do comeback on a next visit, I'll either come super early or super late.. late meaning after 1am! Because we were still in that long line at 11pm! grrr.... But they are open 24hrs so take your pick of the time, but be wise about it.",

    "text": "I love Yelp. How else would we have found this place? It's located inside Palace Station, which is a casino not too far driving distance from most of the Vegas action.  As others have said, it's a bar located inside the casino that is open 24 hours (wow!). Very glad that we tried this place out.  We arrived on a Wed around 10 am and there was NO wait. I think there was one other person there.. Either that or we were the only customers initially.   Ordered a small cup of New England clam chowder, which was tasty. They also offer a Manhattan clam chowder -- I never knew this existed actually, has a tomato based soup.   Then came the combo pan roast that I shared with my husband. It consists of a large bowl of creamy tomato based soup with shrimp, small chunks of crab, and lobster, all cooked in front of us. I did have trouble locating the lobster though, and I wonder if it was because it was shredded? We also received two bowls of white rice. It was delicious and we ate up every last bit, and the portions were more than enough. I will say that since it's creamy, I don't know if I could eat it as an entree every single time, but if they offered a cup/small bowl portion, that would be perfect.  I don't know how I would have felt if I had to wait 1-2 hours, but I think for less than 30-45 min wait --definitely worth it.",

Ordered: - Half a dozen oysters: Big and juicy.  - White clam chowder: possibly one of the best clam chowders I've had. Had chunks of clams with every spoonful. - Combo Pan Roast (level 7): pretty spicy for 7. Came with a scoop of rice. I noticed some people requesting pasta instead of rice. It's a heavy and hearty dish but has really good flavor. Every time I dipped my spoon in crab, lobster, or shrimp was in my spoon. They don't skimp on the seafood here - Bouillabaisse - The very light version of the pan roast. Pan roast it creamy, bouillabaisse is not creamy but has the same deliciousness as pan roast. Comes with rice. It's like a seafood soup almost.  The servers and the chef are very nice and helpful. Since it was our first time the server helped us order.   This place is found inside the Palace Station casino. Parking isn't bad, but we took a cab there.  Will definitely be coming back here everytime we're in town.",

Time of day: Saturday at 12:30 pm (weekend of life is Beautiful and I heart)  Wait time: sat down around 1:30-1:45 Party: of 5  Ordered: A dozen oysters: The oysters came out cold and tasted really fresh. It was sweet and didn't taste salty.  Combo pan roast level 4 The pan roast is my favorite here. I've ordered the gumbo my first time here but then noticed everyone ordering this orangey-pink bowl so I had to try it the next time I went. The combo pan roast has shrimp, crab and lobster. If you want chicken and sausage then order the Palace Station Pan roast. You can order the rice on the side if you don't want it in the sauce. 4 was a perfect for me but again I can't  handle the spice.    The service: They were a lot faster today. Usually it's an hour wait then an hour wait again for food. The wait staff was attentive and everything came out fast!!!!",

Open 24 hours, you must be at least 21 years of age to sit at the bar, incomplete parties will not be seated, and you must be seated to place orders to-go. Since we did not make it to our night festivities, we decided to wait in this line.   We looked over this menu over and over again and still have not decided on what we want because everything looks absolutely amazing. With this wait and over 2000 reviews we must order absolutely everything.    After an hour of waiting, we were finally seated. And of course we already knew what we wanted. We were greeted with bread and our order of drinks. We ordered seafood jambalaya, the palace pan roast, and the seafood combo plate. We asked for our food to be spicy but he suggested that if we wanted to enjoy our food we should change our spice level to a 5 and we did.   The oysters were great. Add lemon, cocktail sauce, and Tabasco and it was the perfect oyster every time. The shrimp were jumbo. And we didn't get to try the clams because they ran out but we were compensated with more oysters. The palace pan roast was exceptionally creamy and the flavor was perfectly spiced and seasoned. The jambalaya was not as creamy because it's jambalaya but it was just as good and perfectly spiced. I mixed it with the pan roast and thought it was great  It literally is a group of organized men. They understand how long we have to wait and made sure our wait while at the bar was not long at all. It was really a great feeling especially being as hungry as we were. What sucked was how although you should never rush eating, but when you're done eating, people should be considerate enough to leave, knowing how long we waited and how long they had to wait to be seated. But the chef was nice, the people are patient, and the food was great. Definitely worth the wait.",

Once you're seated the drive and wait will reward you.  The combo pan roast with shrimp, crab and lobster is amazing.  It's hard to describe but to it's a cooked down tomato based broth with the aforementioned and other greatness.  The oysters are also awesome. It's one of my must visit restaurants while in Las Vegas.",

(yes, oysters & pan roasts for breakfast  lol) The service is quick & friendly. It's cool to see the food being prepared. The seafood is fresh - tried both oysters and clams on the half shell and they're fantastic. Goldband oysters are only $1 each during certain times. (i believe mon-fri 5am-10am or something. it displays on their screen on the back wall) Also, last time i tried the lobster pan roast and it was out of this world and this time I tried the clam chowder and let me tell you... it was loaded with tons of clams, shrimp & lobster. Definitely worth it, even though it's pricey.",

I thought I've reviewed this place already as I've taken photos in the past, but here   Food: Large oysters! You can do a split with clams. They give each guest bread when seated. Food ranges between $6-26, $50 for Seafood Jackpot. One entree is perfect for one, but you can always split it with someone or take half home if ordering other items to feast. My Top 5: 1. Combo Pan Roast 2. Shrimp & Lobster Fra Diavolo. This one starts at 5stars of spice. 3. Cajun BBQ Peel & Eat Shrimp 4. Bouillabaisse 5. House Etoufee.  Spice: I usually get 2-3 stars because that's all I can stomach and I like to taste the food, BUT the Diavolo was 5 stars and was perfect!  About the wait*: The wait being anywhere between 30-minutes (when theres 2-4 people in front of you) to 2.5-hours (when the line goes a little past that first slot/Keno machine) standing. Great to go with someone so that you can switch spots with each other to go fetch drinks or take turn playing slots while you wait. There's always a wait no matter the time of day. I've only been on weekends or weeknights. The only time I didn't see a line was NYE 2017 between 9pm-12:10AM. It was weird.  *Make sure your party is present to be seated and all present to order. You can't order to-go unless you're seated. I THINK they close on Tuesday nights at midnight for a few hours to clean the entire station. I could be wrong. Maybe call ahead if you plan on going at that day or time.",

I've been here 3 times in the last two years, and each time the wait was somewhere between 2-4 hours in line. To have so many people continuously willing to wait several hours just to eat here, well it says a lot about how good the food is.   So far I have only tried the Lobster and Shrimp Fra Diablo and the House gumbo. Both are really good. I always ask for it to be as spicy as possible but I feel like they are always too scared to actually give me what I want, but this tends to happen everywhere with me when I ask for spicy food. There are so many dishes here that I want to try, especially the pan roasts. I just wish I could eat here more often.",

It's located in Palace Station Hotel and Casino but don't let the location fool you. I was bit skeptical when I read so many positive reviews but let me tell you it's hands down one of the best meals I have ever had! Just be advised that the restaurant is just a bar with a handful of seating and the wait averages anywhere from two to three hours. I personally waited approximately three and a half hours in line on a Tuesday afternoon. Everything the menu has to offer will blow away your tastebuds so do yourself the favor and give it a try!",

Easy to swap out of line and try to pay for dinner with some slot winnings.   Bar was hopping that night.  We were eight back in line when two groups left at the same time opening up eight seats.  The bar was clean.  Our server was quick to get us drinks and place our order.   the staff was working hard and having fun with the guests.  i got the combo pan roast.  comes with shrimp, crab, and lobster.   Added chicken to it.   that was a ton of protein.  The sauce is a rich red sauce with tons of flavor.   My buddy got the Alaskan Chowder, New England style.   His bowl was not skimpy either!   Both meals were plenty.   probably could have split just one........ which is what my wife and i have done in the past.  The sauces were complex and delicious...... forced myself to put my spoon down!   Important note:   The casino is a little dated and the wait is a bit, get over it.   It's all about the quality of the food and the experience.   Oyster Bar is on my perpetual bucket list.",

In the line we were speaking with the locals ahead of us and they mentioned that they a) come here every week and b) there's always a line but it's worth it.  We finally got seated and I got the combo pan roast, which the server said was really popular. I like spicy food so I asked for the max level. It ended up not that spicy but the local said ask for the \"lava sauce\" and I did. You can get it on the side and it's pretty good. It adds a lot of flavor and spice but doesn't kill the dish. I would definitely recommend getting this.  I think one downside is I overheard the chefs arguing because one of them didn't wash their hands.  I would still go there but hopefully they don't have similar problems.",

The oysters are soooo juicy, and they opened the oysters in front of you which was really cool! -Ahh yes the famous COMBO PAN ROAST ($24.99): This is a creamy stew with shrimp, crab and lobster. And you get to rate the scale of spiciness 1-10. This was HUGE & DELICIOUS! You can share it with 2 people and the seafood was amazing :) -New England clam chowder bowl ($8.99): I loved this; creamy & had chunks of potatoes.

(crazy)  TIPS: -The server said to arrive there 6:00 am to 9:00 am if you want to avoid the long wait -Free sour dough bread :) -Happy hour includes: 1/2 dozen oysters for $10 from 1:00 am to 9:00 am",

The common subject while waiting in the line is \"it's worth the wait\" and it's True.   You'll be attracted to other items on the menu, but make sure you first try the famous Combo Pan Roast. A creamy tomato stew cooked with Shrimp, Crab & Lobster and finished with a hint of Brandy. Served with Steamed Rice. I add Okra.  $24.99  Sure there are other Oyster Bars in town, same owner too but it's just not the same as this 20 plus year establishment.  It at least you can get sit down service. Speaking of 20, that's the amount seats they have around the kitchen bar which is why the wait.  I also really love their Clam Chowder. If you ask nicely they will give you a sample.   The only thing I wish they would add is Crystals Hot sauce. I mean this is a Louisiana cuisine right? Thankfully they have all the other hot sauces that satisfy the heat craving. And I like it hot. With that mentioned, I usually get level 5 or medium so I can still taste it but enjoy level 6 also. Any hotter then a 7 and you just can't taste the wonderful flavors.",

I love the fact that they cook your special pot of deliciousness right in front of you and just for you! I ordered the combo pan roast which comes with shrimp, crab, and lobster. So many huge pieces of seafood in it!!! My man ordered the Palace pan roast with shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage. Both of us wished we ordered them spicier as level 5 wasn't enough. Next time!  We also tried a shrimp cocktail that delivered fresh and juicy shrimp with extra spicy horseradish! Loved everything and understand why this place is so popular.",

Time is money and money flows in various volumes.  The food was excellent! Had the raw oysters that were Huuuge and magnificent.  A must have!  I had the combo cioppino like meal spiced at number four which was perfect!  Server and Chef know what their doing here and their friendliness made the wait worth it; because after all, nobody made me wait. I wanted to try this place and I'm glad I did. You will too. Buss staff made this place a four instead of a five.",

The oysters are super plumped and always fresh.  I always order the Lobster Pan Roast and you can choose the spice level from 0-10?  The lobster seriously melts in your mouth, like LITERALLY.  You cannot order this pan roast from any where else that's as good as this location.  When in Vegas, this is a MUST stop no matter what!",

    "text": "AT LONG LAST.... I made it to The Oyster Bar. I have been to Palace Station many times over the years but only to eat at their 24HR restaurant for some cheap steak & eggs and such. I was missing out this whole time not knowing what this counter of seafood eating had to offer.   We waited a good hour to hour and a half. That was brutal. Not used to waiting that long but there are only 16 chairs so waiting is the only way. Even for take-out... I've been told that the wait is usually longer so I can count myself lucky. You just have to wait and you will be rewarded with some of the tastiest food in Las Vegas.   We started off with a half dozen oyster on a half shell. They are gold band oysters and priced at $11.99. Oysters were a decent size and tasted good. I would just go for the dozen next time. A little lemon, a little salt and a little hot sauce. You're golden... For my entree, I had to have the famous pan roast. It's all people were talking about in line and in the Yelp reviews. I went with the Palace Pan Roast ($23.99) and that comes with shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It was delicous. The pan roast is a creamy tomato stew cooked in a steam kettle right in front of you. You choose the ingredients and they cook it right there. It's really quite amazing. The chefs have it down to a science. I've never seen food cooked like that so I was lovin it. The food tasted great. The combination of ingredients in the  creamy tomato stew served with white rice in the middle of it was excellent. I went with mild but you tell them how hot you want or can handle... It was such a good meal. I wish I would have tried it sooner. I've been going to Vegas for decades and have been missing out all this time. Now I know.  Service was great. The chef was a wealth of knowledge. Like a seasoned bartender except he's mastered steam kettle cooking. Our server was super nice and they pack all your leftovers so you can enjoy the rest back in your room. 5 stars... with the wait. Easy. Go to Palace Station. Now... You're welcome.",

    "text": "The hype is real and it is totally worth it!  I waited here for over 2 hours after years of having this place bookmarked I finally did it and it was amazing! Their oysters are amazing and their pan roast is amazing.   This oyster bar is a bar that only seats about 15 people located in Palace Station. This is so exclusive that You even have to wait in line to place a to go order. I could be totally making this up but I swear there's like a cult following for THIS oyster bar in particular-even though many of the casinos in Vegas have one.  Oyster Bar serves a handful of soups, stews, pastas, and fresh seafood. They are known for their pan roast, gumbo, and fresh oysters. If you never had a pan roast it is almost like a soup that is finished with cream sauce. They have you pick a spice level and I recommend going medium at least. I have to say I did see the chef using bags of frozen seafood, but my fish was cooked so well I honestly can't even complain.   Me and my buddy had a half dozen oysters on the half shell, a half dozen clams, vodka oyster shooters, and our own pan roasts. TheI had a hard time deciding between one with sausage, chicken, and shrimp or the one with shrimp, lobster, and crab I believe so we each got one. I have to say the sausage one had a depth of flavor the lobster one didn't, but the lobster one had lobster so it's just up to preference.    The food was amazing. The portions are right for the price tag- all the fishes are around $20-$25.  My one regret is not trying their clam chowder.  If you ever have time to kill then Oyster Bar is an experience to be had. Now I want to find out how the sunset station location compares.",

This small pretty much looks like a few tables on a counter and the other people will be waiting in this pretty massive line to get a seat at the table.   It took us two hours to reach and get seated. When we did we literally ordered the entire world. It was just the thought of having to come back and maybe possibly not getting full from our order, that we just decided to order a lot of different items.   First it was the oysters, clams and shrimp platter for starters. That has variety which I thought was a smart decision. Then we ordered two different types of meals one was the pan roast with all the different seafood in it. The other one was called the Alaskan chowder. Everything that was ordered your able to change the spicy level in the broth.   Overall everything tasted so good but sadly we didn't finish either soups. It was so good though each had their boldness and flavors plus texture was so good! I would suggest eating just one of the bowls and adding possibly rice and noodle to your order.   In the end we were so stuffed and for sure it was one of my favorite meals of Vegas. I would say this is a total experience and worth the wait that we had waited in.",

When you're seated, you can see exactly what the chef is making right in front of you. We ordered the combo pan roast, palace pan roast and oysters. You also get complimentary bread while waiting for your food to be made! I loved the combo pan roast which consisted of lobster, crab and shrimp. I got it in a spice level 6 which was perfect for my liking. The palace pan roast had shrimp, crab, chichen and sausage which was also very tasty. As for the oysters, they were fresh big and juicy if that's what you like. I personally prefer small oysters packed with flavors so I might probably pass on the oysters next time!   I can't wait to come back to try their gumbo! I heard the line is usually shorter on weekdays around 2-3pm so plan around your schedule if you can!",

Luckily we came on a Monday morning at about 11am and there was a 30 min wait. This is located inside palace station casino btw. Hell, maybe I'll come to gamble here next time while my wife waits in line lol.  She got half a dozen HUGE oysters which she loved, shucked right in front of you. She also got pasta with clams, which was pretty good.  I got the famous combo pan roast but was said when they said they didn't have lobster. So just crab and shrimp. It was delicious with tons of seafood, creamy with some rice. The portions are huge with reasonable prices. The entrees are about $23 and definitely can feed two people. I will be back!",

We had the combo pan roast + 6 oysters.   My husband said the oysters were delicious and they were full and large (if that's a thing with oysters). The pan roast was on point. There was healthy portion of lobster, shrimp, and crab meat in it. It's hard to go wrong with a buttery, creamy gravy/sauce but I appreciated that the flavor was very full of seafood! It almost tasted like a lobster bisque.   The prices are high per dish but the portion is big enough that you could split if you wanted. Apparently there's always a wait but we came at 330p on a Tuesday and we didn't have to wait.   Finally, the service and experience were quite pleasant. The servers were friendly and chill and they cook/prep the food right in front of you so that's fun.",

    "text": "If u come before 11:00am on a weekday, there is most likely no waiting time. We came at 11:20 & ended up waiting half an hour    Combo Pan Roast: 5/5. This is the best dish here. It's amazingly good & hearty. Portions are super big. U can't finish this by yourself so I suggest u share & order another diff dish. BIG portions of lobster, shrimp, crab..... u need to mix in the scoop of rice or else it'll be too salty by itself. It's DELISH! For $23.99, there's SO much seafood! No wonder this place does incredibly well.  Combo Gumbo: Again, big pieces of seafood. It also comes with sausage & okra. 4/5. This dish will be great by itself but next to the pan roast, it was only second best. Also $23.99. Totally worth it.  Would I come back? Only if I come before 10:00am & there is no line. I'm honestly getting old & cant stand in line anymore hehe",

    "text": "Sure, the wait isn't ideal but have you had their Pan Roast?   Five stars for their food quality and overall flavor. This place is legit for the landlocked state of Nevada. Their seafood tastes super fresh and the oysters we had were plump and meaty. They came in from New Orleans and hot diggity were they delicious - served simply with lemon wedges and cocktail sauce.  The Pan Roast combo was packed with shrimp, lobster, and crab. It's a large serving but I managed to finish the whole bowl. It's served with white rice and comes with a sourdough roll. My roll was a bit chewy like it had been reheated one too many times in the microwave but it was sourdough so the flavor was A-OK. You could easily share the dish but be warned that they charge you a $5 sharing fee if you take up a seat but don't order your own entree. The seating is limited so I don't blame them!   I'm a big fan of this place and my mouth is watering just thinking about going back.",

    "text": "I have been back to Atlanta for four days and I am still thinking of this place, is that sad?  Oh a whim, my girlfriend and I, another serious seafood lover, decided to make the trek to Oyster Bar with about an hour before we were supposed to arrive at the airport. It was 7am, but the craving was strong, and I am SO GLAD we did it!  Follow the signs to \"restaurants\" when you arrive and just keep walking and you'll see the distinct Oyster Bar. There were about 8 open seats when we arrived and I'm now a firm believer that if you want to dine here without waiting the 2-3 hours in the evening, it's absolutely the smartest decision to get yourself out of bed to get this incredible seafood for breakfast.  We asked the manager and the chef to rush our meals after we explained our situation and they were incredibly accommodating, even going as far as packaging our food and joking to us with smiles. I ordered a half dozen oysters on their morning special - $10; and we both tried the Combo Pan Roast: SHRIMP, CRAB, AND LOBSTER for $23.99. Like literally ohmygosh, this is so delicious. The pan roasts are the way to go: they are cooked in front of you, the smell is intoxicating, and when it arrives it is hot and steamy. Following the advice of the reviewers, I ordered a spice level 5 and it was perfect -- a bit of a kick but not too spicy.  The service here is fantastic, the food here is fantastic, not sure why it took me so long to try this place but I will definitely come back every trip to Vegas from now on. MUST TRY!!!!",

I would recommend that you don't go when you are starving because the wait is long. Our wait was maybe an hour long but we just chatted while we waited and once seated were attended to right away. Definitely worth the wait and will be going again soon.",

The tomato stew was perfectly creamy and packed with flavor. I like that the flavors were well balanced and didn't have any one part that overpowered the rest. I also like how they added fresh chopped vegetables (onions, bell peppers, tomatoes) to the pan roast for texture. The shrimp were large and very fresh; each was firm and cooked perfectly. The pan roast didn't need any additional seasoning and didn't lack any essential flavors, so I think it was a great standalone dish. I also received some fresh, warm bread that was great dipped in the sauce. The rice could have been better, but it wasn't bad. This was a very solid pan roast.",

The lobster gets kind of rubbery after a while though, so I think I will go with the crab pan roast next time. I also tried the gumbo which was very flavorful and full of yummy okra. The cook and entire staff are also super nice. Someone brought their own chopsticks and the cook just found that so hilarious. I am not particularly a fan of the rice though because I eat jasmine rice practically everyday. I guess that's just personal preference though.",

(But it's so good, you may try to eat it all at once!) 5) It was one of my BEST meals while in Vegas. 6) Although the pan roast is not advertised as \"cajun,\" if you have them to spice it hot for you, it is some of the most AUTHENTIC cajun food you'll ever have on the west coast!  (and I'm from down south!) 7) The service is great, and the chefs engage in conversation w/you while preparing your food in front of you! 8) This place is on my MUST visit list every time I'm in town!

I liked it to the point I kept craving the taste the next day  - chef D was so accommodating because of our long wait. He gave us a free bowl of rice. Overall, the man looked like he loved his job.  - the combination pan roast was mmmm yummy! Definitely can be shared between two people  Cons:  - the place was tiny. I've seen oyster bars before, and this location looked like it was half the size of the past oyster bars I have seen.  - even tho people would leave and pay out, the service of cleaning the table and seating a party was a mess. People would be in line while there are possible 6 open seats on the bar.  - happy hour was not worth it. Our waitress notified us that the happy hour only included a 1/2 doz oysters for $10.. was expecting more.   Gave this place a 3 because service could be very much improved",

The 1st tip is to come early, I was there by 9:00 a.m. and there were a few open chairs.  It took a while to be waited on but once my order was in, your drink and bread arrives.  The open spots filled up while awaiting the food.  I ordered the Combo Pan Roast but I wished I had ordered the House CPR because they add sausage.  It took a while for the food to arrive but you get to watch the cook it.  Everything was good until the Big White guy cooking insulted the larger ladies sitting at the bar.  What?  He said: \"I was going to say it's Thursday Big Girl Day\"... again, What??  Don't the people that work there realize that everyone sitting at that bar are paying their salaries?  Stupid people Everywhere!  Tip to Management; Get rid of the guys there that don't know how to treat your customers.  You've lost one for life!  I will never be back there again due to this ignorant behavior.",

Will cost about 30 bucks for a meal. Just get the pan roast, it's really creamy but really good. You don't need to order 3 dishes for two people as the their servings are huge.

But I finally got to try the magnificent Combination Pan Roast and I must say, it's absolutely delicious!  As first timers, our chef, Ricardo, recommended the top 3 things to try- 1. Any Pan Roast - seafood sauteed with brandy, cream, tomatoes, and served with rice  2. House Gumbo - shrimp, crab, and lobster in a creole soup with okra and sausage, served with rice 3. Bouillabaisse - French stew with shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels, and clams.  We ordered the Combination Pan Roast, House Gumbo, and a half dozen oysters.  I waited for about an hour and I wasn't about to miss the opportunity of trying oysters at the Oyster Bar!  Upon receiving the order, we watched the oysters being shucked and they were presented to us as soon as he was done.  The oysters were soo good and fresh!  I could have a dozen of these to myself.  While waiting for our entrees, our chef and oyster shucker were cracking jokes and making conversation with us.  We learned that they only have 6 pots and 18 seats because of health codes, so if they ever expanded, it wouldn't be called the Oyster Bar since they'll have to be cooking in the back.  Booo.  Also while waiting, we had a sample of their clam chowder and it was just like what you would find down at the wharf.  There was plenty of meat and had a nice, fresh, ocean taste to it.   Next comes the good stuff--The Combination Pan Roast was to die for!  This bowl was jam packed with seafood!  The brandy, cream, and tomatoes made a thick and rich soup.  It was just what I needed since I had a cold that day.  My bf said Oyster Bar has ruined gumbo for him because now he can't get it anywhere else, it's THAT GOOD!  They ask how spicy you want it from 1-10.  I got a 5 to be on the safe side, but I think a 7 would have been the perfect amount to clear my sinuses.  For the gumbo, they say their base already packs a level 3 heat so if you order a 5, it's actually an 8.    From 2 people I've talked to while waiting in line, I hear their Shrimp Scampi is delicious, but I can't see myself ordering anything else but the Pan Roast.  I would definitely come back and wait for hours just to have some again.",

You already know the food here is going to be good, I highly suggest the pan roast, it is the favorite around here.  I had the gumbo and the boullabaise.  The gumbo had delicious sausage pieces and the boullabaise was light, unlike the pan roast and gumbo, the heavy weights.   Why did this place lose a star? The place is way too busy and is just not adequately staffed, further, does not have the seating nor means to serve more more than 8 people at a time. Also, while this is no fault of theirs, some customers like to take TWO HOURS to eat their meal at a BAR. Come on man, don't be this kind of customer when you see a giant line of people trying to get a meal here.  Also, I'm sad they got rid of the 50 oz beer.  I'll definitely be going back but will be dreading that long wait.",

    "text": "If the review was based off of food alone this would be 5 out of 5. However the service was not. Not sure if the girl who was serving Saturday graveyard was tired or just flat out a grumpy person and didn't like dealing with late night customers.   We had no ill will waiting in line for 2 hours to get our spot at the bar. The aroma and anticipation of the food was overwhelming. As we were escorted in groups of two to take the seats at the bar from right to left, one of the couples in front of us made the mistake and tried to sit at the center of the bar. The girl who was serving rudely approaches this couple in front of us and scolded them for sitting in the wrong seats. The gentleman she was speaking to had no problem moving down the line to the right to sit in the correct seat. She belittled him and was flat out snappy and rude about sitting in the wrong seat. Of course he was a little taken back by her behavior and snapped back at her after waiting in line for 2 hours. After they had completed their meal ahead of us she made a snide comment to others that if he sat there any longer she was going to call security! Seriously calling security over what?  So we sat down and waited  for them to get to us for our order. We ordered an appetizer of shrimp cocktails and each ordered a bowl of soup and an entree.  We were served our soups and then our entrees and started to eat them. They were fabulous! Some of the best linguini diablo I have ever had.  Part way through finishing our entrees, we finally received our shrimp cocktails. No big deal, they were just as good as the entrees.  After finishing the meal the girl brought us a receipt of our tab. I looked it over and everything was correct and patiently waited for her to return to discuss payment.   When she was finally complete with running the other tabs, she looked at me and in a sarcastic tone says I need cash or a card to complete your order. Very politely I stated I am charging my room can I have a pen to fill this out? I then gave her my Id, players card and my room number. She went to the terminal and came back and said you are not listed I cannot charge the room you are asking. I politely asked her to check again to see if she may have looked up the wrong room. As there were over 250 of us there for a reunion and had been staying there for 4 days. Many of us at the reunion have the same name.....(long story).   instead of looking again like I asked she spouted off to me that she wasn't going to look again and that I needed to pay in some other payment. I then asked her to call a manager to look it up as I had been charging to my room the last 3 days and just hours earlier we had been charging at the bar.  Next thing I know I have security tapping me on the shoulder asking me to come with them. Mind you I never raised my voice, never created a scene or spoke to this girl in any hostile way.  After speaking with security for another 45 minutes, the hotel manager came over and apologized for her mix up. The server was looking at the wrong room with the same last name. Every time I tried to tell her this she wanted no part of listening to what I was saying. The hotel manager completed the room charge and we went on our way.  It's truly unfortunate to have been treated that way. Customer service goes a long way in the service industry. I know that some days we have good days and bad days, however it is never appropriate to speak to paying customers the way she treated me and my guest.   It's a shame because the product was really good. But the service was horrible.",

Oyster bar at the palace station is absolutely amazing and if you're visiting Las Vegas this is a big local hot spot.  Yes the wait is long.  We waited about an hour and half but seriously this is worth it.  If you can wait in line at the DMV or for the new iphone you can wait at this place and you won't regret it, i promise you.   Service:  So much fun!!!  I've never had such a great time with the staff and honestly got to the point of tears due to the laughter.  Everyone seated by us joined along in our festivities and jokes and it was truly a memorable dining experience.    Our chef Ricardo was hilarious, knowledgeable and just an all around great guy.   He explained to use that they only have limited seating due to health codes and the pots they use to create the gumbo and pan roast have been used for ages.  The seasoning and flavor is literally embedded into the pot and expanding the restaurant would mean introducing pots that are new and not already fused with the spices of the years of usage.   We got the oysters which were freshly shucked right in front of us and tasted very fresh and plump, very nice.  The spice range is from 1-10 and they tell you that anything above a 5 will leave you sweating.  Personally I think I could've done a 6 or 7 but the 5 was perfect.  Just enough kick without compromising the True flavor.  I got the gumbo and it was to die for! So many blends of spices and served in a giant bowl.  You will end up taking it home which i'm not complaining about, you'll get to carry the experience back home.   Overall: This place is absolutely amazing and i never ever mind waiting in line for it.  This is truly a gem of Las Vegas and if you ever stop by, you definitely need to check this place out.",

Fresh oysters on the half shell ($19.99/dozen): the oysters are huge! Since you sit at the bar, you can watch the chef shuck the shells and the oyster meat is very big! Pretty much well worth your money. The oysters tasted fresh and delicious as you slurped them up! (5/5)  2. Palace Pan Roast ($23.99): fresh seafood sauteed with cream, brandy, and tomato. Our huge bowl came with shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage. It comes with a bowl of steamed rice. An extra bowl of steamed rice is additional $2.99. Overall, it is very delicious!! It is just as good as the House Pan Roast at Ritters Steam Kettle! (5/5)  The service is friendly and you can definitely tell that this place can get pretty busy! The whole bar was full of customers even at 3-4am in the morning! So that pretty much says A LOT! Will definitely come here again =)",

And of course, the wait was worth it.  We had the following.

    "text": "Summary: My SO and I like to dine at Ritter's Steam Kettle in Costa Mesa, California (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritters-steam-kettle-cooking-santa-ana\">yelp.com/biz/ritters-ste...</a>) and when we found out Oyster Bar was own by the same company we have to give it a try. The wait was long (1 hour 17 minute to be exact) we were behind 5 couples but it was worth it.  Food: We had Cold Seafood Combination, New England Clam Chowder, and Combo Pan Roast. It was exquisite, the food tasted phenomenal. I don't know was it because of the long wait or not but at that moment I think it taste better than Ritter's.   Service: The Chef was awesome, just watching him prep the pan roast and constantly making sure his patron were satisfied. Nick, the server/host was a tad unprofessional. So the Chef happen to place our dish at the wrong patron, no need to raise your voice at him. The Chef job is to prep and cook not serve. He was doing you a favor, helping you out and when he place my order to the people beside me, you shouldn't have snap at him. It still amaze me how the Chef just stay mellow and apologize to you. Not to mention when you were behind, he even step outside the counter to bust the table and seat the next group. Show some appreciation man.   Overall: I always make it a habit to go to Egg & I (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-l...</a>) for breakfast  every time I visit Vegas and now Oyster Bar is a must also. I'm so glad Oyster Bar isn't located on the strip. Imagine if it was, I'm probably looking at half a day wait time. Then again, it is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So that's not bad.",

    "text": "Yes I was one of those who waited 2 hours, yes I got there on a 11:45am and didn't eat until 2pm, yes this was the Sunday of Labor Day weekend with about 14 people in front of us when we got in line (total of 16 active seats).  It was well worth the wait if you come in a group and some of you can break off to gamble and basically take turns waiting. They do NOT have a reservation system NOR do they have anyone to jot your name down and call you back for your seat, you HAVE to have someone wait there.  Onto the food, they are HUGE portions. Seriously unless you eat 1.5x the average person consistently, you should not get apps. Those bowls they give you (I got Alaskan Clam Chowder) are FULL of seafood, almost a pounds worth. Then the soup is another .5 pounds, or at least it feels that way. So much flavor and people love the chowder, and pan roasts. The roasts don't come with enough rice but I dont think they charge you to get more. Either way all of it is a ton of flavor, lots of different types of soups and all loaded with seafood. The chowder I had I would LIKE to eat as 1.5 meals and I see a lot of people taking a to-go container for the rest but hey I'm in Vegas for vacation, dinner must be had elsewhere. I would recommend this!   Note I have not had the other one at Harrahs, so I can't speak to the quality of it but I would assume the line would be MUCH shorter.",

I love trying to find a locals place that is amazing and the 4.5 stars with 1600 reviews would tell you this place would be amazing but its not.   I think the place is good because you come hungry and they have you wait 2 hours, so by the time you actually get eating, you are so hungry that even mediocre food will taste great.",

The pan roast is so good that it's popped up in my hometown in Orange County.. Although he is former chef to Oyster Bar, it's just not as good.  Same people always working every time I visit. The chefs are really nice and easy to talk to... Even at 4 IN THE MORNING! I give props for dealing with all the pan roast fiends at ALL wee hours of the night for years on end!   The oysters at \"oyster bar\" aren't the freshest though. The clam chowder is good. The steamed clams are good. The bouillabaisse is good. BUT PAN ROAST IS THE BEST!!! I personally get rice on the side & lvl 8/9 spicy but I love my food more caliente!  DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SHARING... because leftovers are just as good later when you're drunk.",

We were super lucky to come in with only 2 couples (4 folks) in front of us. However, we still waited close to 45 minutes. And now that that's out of the way...this place has got to be one of the most legit shellfish/seafood joints in Vegas. Great quality and flavor. Customer service isn't 5 star but you are sitting on bar stools...at a bar and these guys a dripping sweat trying to get the customers in and out so the rest of the people that have been waiting for hours can have a taste. It's okay though because when you are finally seated your olfactory glands will be hypnotized by the aromas of the ingredients used as the chefs prepare everything right in front of you. Aside from the oysters and other platters they have great chowders and pan roasts that will leave you yearning for more. But no worries you will have plenty leftover to take home the portions are huge!",

The 1/2 oysters were good but because there are only 6 I found I wanted more.  ( the last time I was here I got the full dozen and it was worth it. ) The clam chowder was really good. If you are sharing it the bowl is fine but too big if your eating alone. I mean after all you have to at least try 2 or 3 things I mean what's the point in waiting for hours. The chef is all business but can be entertaining to watch, I enjoyed seeing him prepare so many different entrees at the same time.   Look it's really simple. Just try it. I also found it nice to get to talk to other people waiting in line with you. Each and every time I've been here everyone was super nice and excited to he waiting.

Advised of a tip to go on a weekday before between 6 am to 10 am arrived at about 9:30 am on a Thursday. There were 4 empty seats at the Oyster Bar which actually is a bar that you seat yourself at. The waitress was curt but prompt and took care of us with efficiency even if it wasn't overly friendly.   The fabled Combo Pan Roast did not dissappoint.   I ordered mine with crab lobster and shrimp at a heat level of 7.  You watch the chef making your food in special steel kettles that prevent scorching of the stew. The flavor was what you would expect from enormous amounts of butter, cream and a bucket of shellfish infused with Cajun spice.  It was rich, delicious and satisfying. In fact one bowl is probably enough for two (they will charge you a fee if you split the bowl however).    From what I understand anyone under 21 cannot be seated there because it is technically a bar.  So you will have to leave the kids at home and bring them takeout.    Great seafood stew. Maybe the best I've ever had.  It is very rich though and not something you can eat frequently. I imagine it would be very good if one was hungover.",

    "text": "$@,!:$,8/&2?;&;' goddamn the wait is long! But man it was worth the wait. Here is my review:  Interior: this place is inside palace station, one of the old casinos off the strip. When I saw the casino from the outside, I thought this place is gonna be shady, but unlike the casino, the bar looks nice and neat!  Customer service: my girl and I got there around 915 and got seated after an hour. We had to wait another 45 mins to get our food. They could seriously expand or give people a piece of bread while waiting. I went there hungry and almost died before eating. Another thing that bothered me is the staff. The chef was kinda cold when the ladies next to us were joking and waitress wasn't any better. She was jus spotty.   At this point, you might wonder why I give this place five stars.. The game changer..  Food: the combo pan roast was jus redunk. I never had anything similar before. The soup was creamy and rich. The lobster, crab, and shrimp were harmoniously dancing around in the soup while I was indulging myself.   I was desperate, hungry and miserable while waiting but all is forgiven. I salute you, oyster bar. I'll never forget you!",

Bf and I got two orders of the pan roast seafood combo and some raw oysters to share. The oysters were super disappointing-- there was NO oyster flavor whatsoever and it just tasted very bland.  The pan roast was amazing though, super hearty and rich. It's great if you're really hungry like we were, which I'm sure you will be by the time you get seated. I liked watching the chefs cook right in front of us. Would I come here again? I think so... the only reason why I wouldn't give them a 5 is because of the long wait and the mediocre oysters. Otherwise, the pan roast was great! The large portions are good enough for two people to share :)",

Now, I try to come early (today,  on a Saturday 8a-I walked right up) when people are still sleeping.  I almost always get mine to go because it is too rich to eat on my own and my underage daughter can't come here (you can only do this if you're seated).   The staff is friendly and if you come at the right time (or if you don't and have lots of patience),  this is one of the best and most affordable places to eat in Vegas.

    "text": "Oyster Bar is bomb!! If you like any sort of seafood or Cajun-style food you MUST try this place out.   The line's usually long during peak hours (hour+ wait anyone??) but it's worth it! The bar is very small, only 18 seats so you have to wait for everyone to finish before you can get seated and that's why the wait is so long. It's open 24/7 so I would suggest coming at random times - like at 2am - if you want to avoid the line LOL. But keep in mind that you need to be 21+ to sit at the bar! There are no tables or other seating so basically, you have to be 21+ to even eat here. Unless you get to-go.  FOOD The fresh raw oysters here are HUGE!! I've never seen oysters that big and they're fresh too! Their pan roasts and gumbo have spiciness levels 1-10. Level 10 will make you sweat balls and it's the only level that includes habaneros. I love spicy foods and level 10 is a bit too much for me. It will definitely set your butthole on fire afterwards, I guarantee that!  Portions are pretty large too, so I always have leftovers to take home. They actually charge you an extra $5 if you choose to share a bowl with another person, so I would just get your own and then take it to-go later.  The prices are a bit high for the amount you get, but the food is so delicious you will have no qualms about spending $30 on a bowl of food! My suggestions:  - shrimp and lobster diablo - palace pan roast - fresh oysters - gumbo  SERVICE Dolores is so funny! She's an awesome server and we tipped 20% (even though we are usually stingy with tips) because of her! The staff are all great and wear many hats. The cooks also clean and the servers also prep food just because there are only a couple people working. They are very personable and love talking to their guests!  OVERALL Love Oyster Bar! The whole process is quite long - from first standing in line to signing our check, it took 2.5 hours. But the food is sooo worth it!!",

Why would people stand in line that long when there's hundreds of other places to eat?  Try it and find out.  One would think that the anticipation of waiting that long would make the ultimate reward less than expectations, but that is not the case here.  Everything we had was top notch, from the caesar salad, to the fresh oysters, to the gumbo and Cioppino.  And when I say top notch, I mean the gumbo was as good as I've had at the best New Orleans restaurants and the Cioppino as good as any I've had including at my favorite, the Tadich Grill in San Francisco.  They make each order from scratch and they custom-spice it for you.  Beware on this.  Take heed.  Unless you really, really can handle spicy hot, keep things at 5 or below (on a 1-10 scale).  The menu has so many different things on it that you could eat there every day for a couple of weeks straight and not get bored.  The servers are friendly, efficient, and it's a great place to strike up a conversation with others at the bar.  So try it next time you're in Vegas, but don't tell anyone else about it.  We don't need those lines to be any longer...:)",

It was worth every minute of the wait. Do not come here starving because of the wait. Have a snack beforehand and you will be set for bliss when you get seated. Also if you come between 1am-9am, there's a sweet happy hour on oysters and drinks.  I think the chefs name is Holoman or soloman... Either way- he creates culinary delights!",

You'll need a car to get here from the strip since it's in the Palace Station casino.  The Pan Roast with rice and Alaskan Clam Chowder each boasted above-average portions of seafood and came swimming in a highly caloric melange of creamy butter, oil, and mysterious pre-made special sauces dispensed from metal canteens.  They plate your food in front of you which is exciting yet agonizing if you're still waiting in line. The bar seats about 15 people. Our party of 7 had to be split up and we ended up waiting over 2 hours for the first 3 of us to be seated. Although there might have been 10-15 people in front of us it still took us this long to get our nom on.. And thus I call it risky to rely on this as your first meal of the day if you're famished and hungover.    Coming from California and having tried seafood in port cities around the globe, I don't think this place was actually that remarkable. The seafood was frozen (remember, Vegas is a desert and nowhere near the ocean) but of acceptable quality.",

Haha   I tried the:  The palace pan roast: Super fresh, cheesy, and delicious  The gumbo: delicious as well but prefer the Pan Roast  Oyster: SO DAMN FRESH Clam Chowder: fresh with lots of oysters and not too salty  TIP: portions are huge and shareable so do not try to eat a Pan Roast by yourself, sharing a plate is $5 extra i believe but you get an extra scoop of rice.",

($13)  The palace pan roast ($24)- shrimp, crab, lobster, and andouille sausage (and chicken which they don't mention). I usually get my spice level at around 7/8 and damn is it good. The spice adds a kick which already adds on to the yummy goodness that leaves your stomach extremely happy and satisfied. The clam chowder is also yummy, but it's not as special as their pan roast.  The only part that is lacking is their service- a bit slow, and you usually have to flag them down to get their attention and it takes forever for the food. But hey, the food speaks louder than their service.",

Coming back from Hakkasan, we were a little tipsy and a lot a bit hungry, so we reasoned that it'd be a great time to try to beat the line and get some Oyster Bar.  Boy, were we wrong. The line was innocuous enough, only about 6 people ahead of us. Little did we know that at 1:00AM, the bar is basically full of wasted/trashed/smashed patrons who would take hours to finish their food.  With only about a dozen seats available at the bar, it took absoltiutely forever for seats to clear up and parties to be seated, especially if it was a party of 4 or more.   On top of that, it seemed like the bar was never made to accommodate so many people, and although all the pots were constantly cooking up gumbo or some other delicious dinner, the food itself took about 10-15 minutes to get served after ordering.  When we finally got seated, the clock read 3:15AM, and only two out of my three companions stayed awake long enough to enjoy the food.  We got one of everything on the menu, and everything was delicious. I wish I could write more about the quality of the food, but I honestly can't remember much after that wait. Just the taste of food and water finally reaching my mouth, as if I had been lost in the deserts of Nevada for days.  The food was good, but i honestly can't imagine anything worth such a painful and tiring wait.    And for the record, 1AM-5AM are not slow hours for them. I think the secret might be coming in around 6AM-8AM when party goers have finally headed to bed, and no one is willing to get up for breakfast.",

Oyster bar is located in the palace station (be sure not to get it mixed up with another placed called oyster bar is LV.. It's not the same)  The best time to go is 3am-8am.. We arrived in LV at 6:30am & got to oyster bar at 7:30 on a Sunday morning & for the first time ever... When we got to the bar we were the only customers. The chefs mentioned that there was a rush about 30min-1hr before we got there. Usually when we go to oyster bar we have to wait for an hour or more (but once we get our food, the wait is definitely worth it!)    We always know what we want to order before we even get to oyster bar. Our usual is combination pan roast w/ level 5 spiciness w/ two rice. The combo pan roast includes shrimp, crab, & lobster.. Some times we like to pay extra & add clams. Level 5 spicy is not very spicy.. I don't like too spicy but my husband does, so sometimes he ask the chef to prepare him a spicy sauce on the side. If you aren't too hungry I would suggest sharing, but if you're very hungry... Get your own because it's soooo good! We also order the oysters (if u go during happy hour they're cheaper)   The staff are all very friendly, usually it's the same chefs that are working each time we go. Overall, I definitely recommend going to oyster bar, once you try it once you'll be hooked! Try to avoid going during busy hours such as lunch & dinner time to avoid the long wait.    I rated them 4 stars because of the long wait.. There's only about 12 seats at the bar or so (you have to be 21yrs old or older) but I rate their food (combo pan roast esp) 5+ stars!",

We went with four people total and took turns waiting in line. Went by faster than if you were there with just another person.   This place is so amazing, all the chefs are amazing! Our personal favorite is Ricardo. We always get oysters, the combo pan roast and the bouillabaisse.   They are masters at their craft. The seafood in the dishes come cooked perfectly, I mean every time we are here. Add extra lobster to your pan roast, that's my tip!!   Go there and be prepared to wait!",

I visited L.V for thee weekend and this place was randomly on my list since I love sea food. Let me wipe my tears because I'm remembering again how amazingly wonderfully delicious the pan roast sea food dish was!! It may have been one of the best dishes I have eaten.  The oysters were the freshest!  Even though this spot only fits 15 people and the wait can be long it didn't effect my review because it was well worth it.  The staff was sweet. The cook that has been there for 28 years was chill and made you smile in his own way.  Some say it is better than Louisiana's Cuisine, I wouldn't doubt that. I will forever come here and will crave that pan roast every day!!  Until we met again Oyster Bar!",

    "text": "So if you haven't been here.. make sure you try it at least once. The wait is quit long because literally its a bar with maybe 15 chairs and you literally just stand in a line formed at the side.. and stare till someone finishes and leaves. BUT IT IS SOOOO WORTH IT!.. We came here on a Saturday night around 7:00? We weren't seated till 2 hours later plus the time we waited for our food to cook. But honestly, no matter where you go in Vegas, if it's good food.. there will be a wait. So JUST BE PATIENT!   So if you are willing to wait, you MUST try their Pan Roast.. This is my second time having it and it was even better than the first time! We got the Pan Roast combo that came with shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage and crab at a level 6 spicy. It was sooo good...Each bite was hot and creamy.. MMMM.. They cook it right in front of you so you know it's fresh! Also portion is huge! So definitely share or expect to take some home. We also got their Shrimp Scampi linguini cooked in a white sauce.. This was alright... nothing too crazy about it. The shrimps were HUGE though.. but overall taste was kind of bland to me. I would stick to the pan roast! You will not be disappointed. Many locations in OC tried to open their own knock off of the Oyster Bar.. but no where near as good. If you're in Vegas and don't mind a wait.. COME TRY THIS PLACE!!",

    "text": "If you're a seafood fan, then I suggest checking this place out.  It's located in Palace Station Casino and yes, I know it's not the nicest looking hotel/casino, but the food is worth checking out.  I've heard people stand in line for over an hour to two for this place, so maybe it's wise to go here off hours.  This place is open 24 hours.  I came here at 7pm and I only had to wait for 30 minutes, which isn't too bad considering there are ONLY  15-18 seats at a bar.  It's also steam kettle cooked and the food is made to order, so therefore the wait tends to be longer.    I ordered half a dozen of oysters and linguini and clams.  The oysters were really fresh and the linguini clams was delicious and the sauce was so flavorful. My wife ordered cioppino, but they made a mistake and gave her bouillabaisse.  She tried it and fell in love and was glad that they made that mistake.  They're generous with their seafood.  Corey was our chef and he was super friendly and attentive to our needs.   I will definitely come back to try other things on their menu. Their menu is also limited and simple.    Also, they have late night specials from 1am-9am: 16oz Bud Light Draft-$3 wine by the glass-$5 Half a dozen of oysters-$10",

The pan roast is buttery, flavorful, and had a lot of ingredients added to it.    Again, the only problem about this place is that this place is way too small.  A max of about 15 people can eat at any given time...leaving hour long waits for patrons.  We got here at around 1am and still had an hour long wait.    4 stars.",

Lemme break it down: 1hourish for the line, 1 hour ish for everyone ahead of you to get their orders and get your order ready. And about 45 minutes for you to savor your meal.  Party greater than 4 is not recommended.  They only have 12 seats.    Maybe have a friend wait for you while you go gamble. Then switch off.  To make the wait more tolerable.    The service was very friendly and they actually talked to us as they were prepping the oysters and clam shells.  Apparently, a lot of celebs come to eat here.     Food: overall food was good but not impressive enough to blow my mind and def not gonna be coming back to spend 3 hours of my limited vacation time here.",

    "text": "The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?  The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats.   We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay.  Well not so fast.   After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol.   40 minutes later our soup comes out.  An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters.  At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees.  3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal.  Was it worth it?  Here's the rundown: New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding.   Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious.   Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure.   I was also able to taste the following dishes.  Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol.   Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time.   Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining.   The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast.   It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol Was it worth it? I say Yes!!  We had great service We had great food.  We had great conversations We had a memorable night.   I'll definitely be back",

Food:   Oysters: Fresh and delicious!  The cocktail sauce with horseradish on the side was great at masking the fishy taste of the oysters. My only complaint is that I wished the portions were bigger.   Combo pan roast:  This big bowl of goodness is something that you cannot find anywhere else.  The best way I can describe the dish is that it is a creamy/ cheesy soup with crab, shrimp, and lobster and a side of rice. Delicious yes, but you will definitely have a FOOD COMA for days, so prepare yourself!  Service:  Since this restaurant is literally a bar table with 12 seats, there was only one chef and waitress doing everything.  The chef Bob and I cannot recall the name of the waitress made it a very enjoyable experience when I was there. They kept cracking jokes throughout my whole time there and on top of that, they were fast and efficient with everything. NO COMPLAINTS.

    "text": "Is anything worth an hour wait? Buffet? Sometimes... High end restaurant? Sometime... Oyster Bar? Yes! I have to admit, even thinking of waiting more than an hour for anything is a tough sell but this one might do it for it.  After waiting for around an hour and 15 minutes of temptation with slots and cheap tables and without reception (beware at&t and T-Mobile customers), I finally got a seat at the bar.  A dozen oysters on the half shell for $20. Freshly shucked by the cook with a side of lemons and cocktail and horseradish sauce. These oysters were really good. Fresh and plump so you are getting a pretty good deal. It's a good appetizer while you wait for the main attraction, the pan roast (around $25). A creamy tomato and cream sauce with a mixture of southern spices with your choice of meats.  The palace pan roast has crab, shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage.  You also get to choose your level of spiciness. I love heat so I chose 9 out of 10. After watching Ricardo (the chef) do his magic for 15 minutes with the pan cooking the meats and the sauce boiling and thickening into a thick concentration of flavor, the pan roast was poured into a bowl and topped with a huge dollop of rice.  After the first bite, you think, it's good but not worth the wait. Then you keep sticking your spoon back in for more and then you realize, this stuff is good. The creaminess and the flavor of the mixtures of spices continue to kick you in the face (in a good way). The chili flavor was good for me but I suggest to go around the 6 or 7 level. I tried my friend's with this level and you get flavors of sweetness. With the 9 and I guess also 10, you are always getting spice.  The meats were not overcooked, mainly the shrimp which was interesting because it wasn't rubbery even though it was cooked for a while. A must get when you are here. The others that looked amazing were the gumbo and bouillabaisse.  As for service, the waitress was very nice and friendly.  She took our orders quickly and was helpful throughout the meal with water refills.  The chef, Ricardo, was the life of the party though. He was sarcastic and entertaining to watch.  Even as he was joking around with the customers, he was serious about the food and made everything, including shucking oysters and clams, very professionally.  So expect to wait. If the line is past the ATM machine, expect a really long wait. Expect great flavor. Expect a filling meal and expect to want to come back again and again. I am a convert and want to come back during every Vegas trip.  The wait is gonna be a struggle but if it is not over an hour and a half, you will see me in line. A solid 5 stars and even though I want to dock a half star for the wait, can't blame a restaurant for having a following and the food pretty much replenishes that star back.",

    "text": "Where have I been?    Oyster Bar gets a ton of great reviews from Yelp, some of my personal friends, and even my own parents.  Just Google Las Vegas Pan Roast and you get sent here to the Oyster Bar.    There's so many Yelp reviews about this place that my review is going to sound like a broken record.  So, I'll keep this one simple with bulletin points.  -Service:  You read it and Yes, there's a wait. This is not because service is lacking.  This is because the Oyster Bar only seats about 15 and the food is as good as it gets.  Service is actually good here.  What takes a long time too is what I call \"Linger Eaters\".  These are people that take their sweet ol' time to eat.  The gf and I aren't \"Linger Eaters\" at all. However, if we are going to wait over an hour to eat, then we're going to take our time too.    -Pan Roast:  They're known for their Pan Roast.  My gf got this and allowed me sample it.  My goodness...everything that I read on these reviews were True.  Superb!!  -Seafood Jambalaya:  This is what I got.  I haven't had Jambalaya in years and was in that mood, especially since the outside temps were dropping.  Overall...packed with mussels, clams, crab, lobster, shrimp, and rice.  Your taste buds will be confused with what it's tasting, but won't be confused whether it's good or not.  My taste buds just voted...pretty damn good.    -Clam Chowder:  Just about average, but you don't come here for chowder.    -Hours:  All Day, Everyday  -Prices:  You get what you pay for.  Most dishes are about or over $20.    Okay, I didn't keep this review too simple.  But it's still bulletin pointed. Oyster Bar is one of those places that you have to try at least once.  Yes, the wait is long.  And Yes, it's in a smokey casino.  But if you're into gumbo, jambalaya, and overall good food, then Oyster Bar is your place.   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (497/500)",

When I visit its same routine.. depending on your group it's a dozen oysters to start and the seafood pan roast for the entree which I highly recommend. When you order they ask what spice level you want from 1-10 and 6 is where the money's at, some good heat right there where you can enjoy your food with out sweating bullets. Anything above that is at your own risk..   One highly suggestion on making your visit the best is to go at some off hours so your wait in line is short but when you think 3:30 in the morning is off hours I wouldn't be surprised if you waited an hour to be seated. So when I go to get me oyster bar it's usually to have it for breakfast! For real breakfast! I don't give a damn! Food is totally worth it! Hope you enjoy.",

When I first heard about Oyster Bar, I thought their biggest seller would be their oysters or something, but their biggest sellers are their pan roasts. I did not know what a pan roast was, but since my friend suggested the dish, I decided to try it anyway.  Their pan roast was really delicious and unique compared to other foods that I have tried. A pan roast consists of a creamy zesty sauce paired with seafood, sausage, or both! With the pan roast, you will also get a scoop of rice to eat with the pan roast. The serving size of the pan roast was very large, so it is definitely a good idea to split your pan roast with a friend. However, there is a splitting fee that can be avoided if you just order one pan roast without getting another scoop of rice if you are fine with that.   I definitely recommend coming to Oyster Bar, but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes due to its popularity and deliciousness! I am looking forward to trying another pan roast and maybe even their other dishes if I decide to come with a larger party!",

We ordered a cup of New England clam chowder, so chunky and delicious!  For my entree I ordered the Combination Pan Roast, includes crab, shrimp and lobster. I requested level 5 on the spicy scale and it was pretty spicy! The sauce it's cooked in is so rich and flavorful! You get a side of white rice too. Very generous portions! My husband ordered the combination gumbo, also a hit! Your food is prepared in front of you so you can smell how delicious it is before you get it! There was only one chef... but considering the space behind the bar I guess there probably wouldn't be a whole lot of room for another.   The only cons for this place would be the insane wait time and the fact that they automatically include gratuity no matter the size of your party. I mean, the food is already incredible of course I'm going to tip!",

The first time I've ever had this place was when my aunt and uncle took me here and ever since, I've fallen in love. Even though it's just a little bar within the casino area of Palace Station, you could smell the seafood throughout the whole floor. I guess the only down side to this place is that since it is a little bar and they only have about 15-17 chairs at the bar, the wait time could be a while. On a non busy day, you're looking for about an 1.5 hour wait for two people. But still, honestly it is so worth the wait.  Eze, the main cook is also very entertaining while he's cooking right in front of you! Which is awesome.  What they're mainly known for the their combo pan roast but what I do like to get is their Alaskan Clam Chowder. Though it may sound truly basic, but it is the best chowder everrrrr!",

It seemed as though everything that day was in our favor because we beat a rush of people and waited probably just shy of half an hour. While we were waiting, we got the infamous 2$ margarita at Palace Station (you can get it at any bar within the casino). If you're curious about the margarita, it's light and fluffy, a lot fluffier than a regular icee and didn't seem that strong in alcohol percentage. Just something chill to sip on. Oyster Bar itself only had about maybe 18 seats? That I counted. It's nice that the flow of the restaurant is quick, so people go in and out in a jiffy. We enjoyed oysters and clams on the half shell and enjoyed both. The clams were more tasty in my opinion. As for our entree, we shared the combo pan roast and barely managed to finish it between us two. Portion was good. Yes the pan roast was good, but I'm not sure what the hype was about?  I'm not sure if I would wait 2+ hours for this.",

They really need a better system for the line area maybe a bigger bar or a hostess stand.    Servers Jill & Melita were on different pages.  The four people in front of us turned into 13 drunk people.   They told Melita that they had a group of 11.  Finally, they were seated two hours later.  Frank called us over to sit & as we are seated, Jill says the group had two more & we'd have to go back to the line.  Manager Ariana came over & had absolutely no clue what was going on & said 13 people were ahead of us.  I said this is so unnecessary cause they are all seated so she was a day late basically.    After they settled the issue, Jill said they were out of all the libations & 24oz glasses of beer, they only had 16oz.  I asked her what the sweeter tomato sauce soup was that I'd had before & she said we don't have a sweet soup.  To me, the Pan Roast does have a nice sweeter tomato sauce.  I asked the chef he said yes it is & let me taste it.  I almost always get the Lobster Gumbo cause to me it is the BEST I have ever had.  Chef Ricardo said he would make me the Lobster, Sausage & okra Pan Roast if I'd like to try something new.  It was fantastic!   I have been coming here for a decade & all the old people are gone besides Chef Ricardo.  The last waitress really had it together w/ the flow of the line & patrons at the bar moving along smoothly.   Thank you Chef for impressing my friends from Iowa w/ the best lobster gumbo & shrimp scampi ever.",

The cook and the ladies running the bar are very very nice! Not pushy or stuck up at all like you usually find at fast paced popular eatery's. Not these people!

It is inside a hotel/casino so you can gamble to kill time if someone else stands in line for ya. There's no waitlist or anything where you can put your name on.  Someone brought out complimentary dinner rolls and butter when we sat down. My party and I ordered oysters, clams, linguine shrimp scampi, clam chowder, shrimp pan roast and the house gumbo with steamed rice. They make all the food in front of you. Chef Ricardo asked if we wanted chopped clams in the shrimp linguine and we were like sure why not.   So, the seafood was super fresh! They have a variety of hot sauce options at the bar. Not a huge seafood person but after the long wait, it all tasted good lol. The shrimp linguini was very brothy. I didn't expect it to be so drenched but nonetheless still tasty. The pan roast and house gumbo were flavorful too. We picked 4 or 5 I think for the heat scale so it wasn't crazy spicy. Check it out if you're in the area!",

It's very hearty and creamy compared to the the boulibasse which we also ordered I think next time I will order the bouli-roast which is the combo of the two. Oysters on a half shell were freaking huge!! They were so tasty! Highly recommend make sure you come hungry but not too hungry the wait could be long because there's only about 15 seats!",

    "text": "Yes, YES, YESSSSSSSS! My coworker described the pan roast here as \"life changing\" so I decided to try this out. Not going to lie, the wait was pretty brutal (maybe because I'm impatient. But i was also hangry). We went on sunday 1030am ish and we waited for an hour. Just standing and waiting in line. No fancy leave your name and they'll call you. Or the fancy getting a text when your table's ready. None of that! But after getting seated, it was allllll worth it. So so worth it! Watching chef bob cook is probably one of the best things in life. So so efficient and fast. Everyone working there is super sweet and busy and efficient. Like, WOW. The kitchen set up is also really interested. Watching him cook is like a show. Its an experience.  We (2x people) started off with the oyster. Honestly, best oysters I've ever had. Just absolutely great. So fresh and juicy. Amazing. Perfecto. And we shared a pan roast. The pan roast mixed with the rice is so great. And the amount of seafood they give you is insane. 2 of us shared a pan roast and honestly, we were full and good to go. And then we also shared the alaskan clam chowder. Also lots of seafood and flavor. I recommend. However, because we were already full from the pan roast, the clam chowder didn't taste as good. BUT! We decided to take it for the road and we had it later in the evening at the airport. And honestly, it was WOWOWOWOWOW! Amazing!!!!!!!!!  So anyway, sorry for the long post but this was my experience. Hope it helps!!! :)",

Get here at the crack of dawn. Maybe it's just me, but I don't just want something and eat it. No, I crave it for days at a time until I break. So knowing I'll want a pan roast tonight, I just get inline around 7am! Oops I mean, what line? Crickets, why? Because usually I'm the only one there!   Don't expect 5pm blood rushing service. The waiters are usually tired and you may have to remind them if you want water or sometimes even let them know your food is  done. Don't take it personal.   The oysters are by no means small! Even when I asked on a whim for the tiny oysters.. I still get heavyweights! If you don't like them too big you may face defeat! ( btw before 9am you get a half dozen for $10)  Last, pan roast is still king! I always take spice level 9 and it never fails to perk up the sinuses! Nonetheless, just as delicious as the first time I tried it!",

    "text": "We have been to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station so many times and we will many more times in the future. It is the best place for gumbo we've found in the LV area. We've tried Southpoint and Sunset as well, but they are just not as good-and I'm not sure why.   Yes, you will wait in line so don't come starving. We tend to go early-before 11:00 and the line has already started to grow for lunch. Waiting is just part of it. You smell the pan roasts and gumbo cooking and see people eating and the anticipation grows. Then, it's your turn to get a seat at the counter.   We have tried a few things. We've had the pan roasts-usually Palace with chicken,  crab, shrimp, andouille sausage-which are very tasty but seem kinda tame. Hubs had the Cioppino and I've had the shrimp scampi which are great too.  But we really go to the Oyster Bar for one thing-the GUMBO!!  First thing you have to know is how hot you like it. They give you a 1-5 with 1 mild and 5 is make-you-cry, remove-paint hot. I like it spicy but still want to taste my food so get a 3. I've tasted a 4 and couldn't feel my mouth for the rest of the day! Hubs gets a 1 because he can't take spicy foods and so he just gets the flavor of the food.  Then you decide which type you want. Hubs gets the House Gumbo that has lobster, shrimp and crab-everything that is good. He loves it and enjoys the flavor it gives to the sauce. I think the sauce hides the wonderful taste of the seafood so I just get the chicken gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage. I love the way the chicken shreds in the sauce and you get lots of andouille sausage which is my favorite part. The rice absorbs the flavors when you scoop it together.   The Oyster Bar is one of our favorite places to eat in LV and we go even though we no longer live there. We do highly recommend it-and may even see you in line!",

We ordered:  1/2 dozen oysters- so fresh, delicious and a great palette cleanser  Bloody Mary- amazing, not too heavy, generous sized shrimp as a garnish   Bouil-Roast (level 5 spiciness) perfect for me because consistency is not too thick and not to watery.. just right balance between pan roast and bouillabaisse. Generous amounts of seafood!   Combo Pan Roast (ordered level 7): it was a little richer, thicker consistency than the bouil-roast, and if that is your preference. Amazingly delicious as well.   Again, we got lucky with just the 45 minute wait. So worth it!!",

The people working the bar know their stuff, order your food spicier than you normally would, they under spice. You won't have a burnt mouth!  There are only 20 seats, so think about when your going to try to get a seat.  For two of us, a dozen large oysters and our meals, plus two large beers, right at $100.00  The pictures don't do a good job of demonstrating the food, but remember, you've got a line of people behind you wanting your stool, to sit here and take pretty pictures of my food wouldn't be very nice!",

We of course had oysters very big and juicy. I ordered the peel and eat Cajun bbq shrimp that was in a broth that was soooo delicious and flavorful. It came with a scoop of white rice. I also had a cup of clam chowder, which was kinda big for a cup which I liked. Very creamy and not fishy taste. My friend had the gumbo that had lobster, shrimp and crab. She said she enjoyed it. Dan was our server he was very nice and helpful. Always made sure we were good always, refilled our drinks. He also packed our leftovers to go such a sweet guy. Will be back for sure very soon. Hope very one enjoys.",

    "text": "It's always a gamble of when to come for the least amount of wait. But the wait is well worth it! If you're a large group - It'd probably be best to split into 2's and 4's as it's bar seating.  Service is always quick, efficient, and everyone working there is really personable.   We've tried both the Pan Roast, and (not so secret) Bouill-Roast. Although the Bouill-Roast is good, the Pan Roast cannot be beat. It's creamier, hearty, and warms the soul. But if you're a fan of Bouillabaisse then definitely give the combo a try. Either dish is a sure fire win for your tummy. The seafood they put into each dish is plentiful. They are not overcooked, and have a nice snap when you bite into it.   100% always get the Oysters. They shuck them literally in front of you and they aren't some small puny ones. Always large, extremely fresh, and tasty.  We will always wait in line for this place, it's WORTH IT. Try to come early in the morning for the best chance at not waiting, probably before 10am. Before you go, eat a small something (or go get a drink, and gamble while you have one person in your party waiting!) and the time will fly by.",

Counter seating makes the meal so much more enjoyable as you see smiling, happy faces all savoring their food!  Every trip to LV now, I gotsta have it!  We try to strategize the timing of the line, but it doesn't matter.  It's always long and they're always busy.  For obvious reasons!  -wink-",

But I get it...it's that good and it's a bar, so you're stuck with very limited seating and you actually have to wait in that line until someone finishes, which makes this place all that more unique. Luckily, I live here now and can come on a random Monday afternoon :D   I have to say this place comes really close to Ritter's in pan roast and oyster quality/taste, but above all this is what makes this place stand out:  -Big pieces of lobster and seafood that they serve in their combo pan roast  -Being a connoisseur of all things spicy, I asked for level 10 spicy and the cook also made me a special concoction of spices that I can throw into my roast to make it even spicier muahaha -You can ask for a side of pasta instead of rice!   Other things that I had here that were amazing were their oysters, New England clam chowder, and the Palace pan roast, all served with a side of sourdough bread (keep them coming because they're free!). Seriously so delicious, and I walked away from this first-time experience full and 100% satisfied!!! And this place is 24/7?!?! Wow, just bury me already from a food coma of heaven and creamy pan roasts and juicy oysters",

Be prepared to wait about 30 - 45 minutes but that's OK, you can drink Coors Light or Modelos while you wait. I recommend everything, it is truly fantastic. I wish they would serve different oysters than from Virginia, I feel the Hard Rock Oyster Bar got the Oysters right but not their pan roast. When you are done drinking and eating delicious pan roast, you can go upstairs and see a fantastic movie at Palace Station's new movie theater.",

The Oyster Bar is located inside the Palace Station. I would highly recommend to go during to off meal times (definitely not during lunch or dinner). Seating is super limited for sure!  The staff is super friendly. There is maybe about 18 seats available. You sit at the counter and watch them chuck oysters and make our food.  PAN ROAST IS A MUST!! The creamy tomato stew is great any time of the year!  We have ordered the Combo Pan roast with shrimp, crab and lobster. We have also ordered the Palace Pan Roast with shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage. The servings are huge and more than enough to share with someone. But if you are sharing, make sure you two can decide on a level of spiciness that you want your meal to be. I can handle spicy but my husband doesn't enjoy it so we usually go for the medium spice (level 5). The Pan Roasts are served with a side of steamed rice. We tried their chowder last time as well. That too was tasty.  This place is consistent and always has some delicious and fresh and  tasting food. Bring a friend and patiently wait in line for a large delicious bowl of amazing pan roast that will totally be worth the wait!!",

This place is located far away from the strip and the bar only seats about 15 people, so be prepared for a line. My friends and I got hungry after golfing at Top Golf and what's better at 3am than seafood?! Lol So we hopped in an uber and were on our way here! The uber driver also recommended it!  The oysters are a must! We ordered a dozen on the half shell amongst the three of us to share, mussels in white sauce, chowder, and the pan roast.  My absolute favorite thing was the oysters. It was my first time having raw oysters and it definitely will not be my last. We were just about ready to order another dozen!  Pro tip: save your bread to mop up your soup or chowder  Glad we found this place and I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas!  Thanks for reading my reviews! Let me know what I should try next!!",

It's a small oyster bar in the middle of the casino at the Palace Station Hotel. There's about 15-20 seats.   Their oysters on a half shell are delicious. They shuck them right in front of you so you know it's fresh.   The best thing to try is their combo pan roast! It's a creamy rich tomato based stew with seafood served over rice. They give you big portions and it'll definitely bring a smile to your face. It reminds me of the yummy Cajun flavors I had in NOLA.  Also tried their Alaskan Clam Chowder and that was pretty tasty too! If you don't like spicy foods or strong spice flavors, this creamy and seafood chowder will blow your mind. There's big chunks of crab, lobster, clams and shrimp. It's rich and hearty.  There's almost always a line unless you come in the morning or during off peak hours but it's worth the wait! I always stop by here on my Vegas trips and look forward to tasting that rich and flavorful pan roast!",

Purely subjective, of course, but I didn't think it was worth the two-hour wait - from standing in line to having my food prepared - for this delicious experience. It was certainly delectable, but I think it is a bit over-hyped.   I went by myself to secure seating a bit faster. I selected the seafood combination pot roast upon a friend's recommendation. At first, I received the meal without rice, and then noticed that others were receiving their orders with rice, so I asked for some. Unfortunately, there were only scraps left at the bottom of the rice cooker, and I received some browned, hardened pieces. Not crunchy, just dry and hard. That probably lessened the experience for me as well. But hey, when in Vegas, I gotta check out some of the popular spots.",

Thankfully, it was revived by amazing tastes of seafood medley presented by the Oyster Bar.   We had half dozen oysters to start off our unforgettable experience. Oysters were big, nicely chilled, and fresh to the death.   Gumbo and Alaskan New England style chowder was served next. You can ask spice on the side. I did that since spicy is not my thing. I'd say both dishes were definitely one of the best I've ever tasted. Portions are quite large, so can you take the amazingness home.  Food was good. Service was two thumbs up. The only downside was the waiting time. Three hours is a long time.    However, it was definitely worth it.",

YES",

When ordering, the chef asked me for the spiciness level from 1-10. I can handle fairly spicy foods but decided to give them a humble 4 (I have been burned before by overestimating my spiciness tolerance). I think I could have handled a 6. But with just a hint of spiciness I was able to enjoy the full flavor of the broth and the seafood in it.   Be warned the average wait is between 2-3 hours. The server told me that they are usually not waiting for seats to be vacated but for the kettles used to cook the delicious pan roasts to become available. So if you're waiting in line and see empty seats but they are not seating you, it probably means all the kettles are full. But trust me, the food is worth the wait!",

    "text": "Ok, so I was definitely impatient waiting for this meal. My friends told me this is a MUST in Vegas. Another hole-in-the-wall joint inside an old Vegas casino located off the strip.   First I was a little skeptical, thinking... oh gosh, this is inside an old freakin casino. Boy was I wrong. Oyster Bar is exactly that-- a BAR. You are seated at the bar!! The wait is longggg and it's first come first serve- no resos. Large groups = stay away!!!  So we got a beer, and waited in line for about 1.5 hours. After we were seated, we got our food in nearly another hour. 3 dozen oysters, 2 pan roasts,  New England clam chowder, and a Manhattan clam chowder. Everything was WELL worth it!!!! Soooooo freakin' delicious! Oysters were so big, juicy and fresh- yum! Pan roast contains a mix of seafood and combined with a tomatoey broth perfected with your level of spiciness.  There's only 1 guy running the show... cooking everything all at once. So BE PATIENT!! You WILL (eventually) get your food! Don't let the old casino fool you!",

When we got there, I expected a restaurant, but it's counter bar seating ONLY.  We saw a line forming and decided to wait.  We called earlier, and the lady said it was an hour and half wait.  She was not lying.  We waited for two hours.  We heard some hangry people behind us, but we talked to a nice couple in front of us to pass the time, and they said it was their second time eating it that week.  We finally got seated and we ordered the half order of oysters, combo pan roast, and the etouffee.  The portions are huge.  My boyfriend and I watched as the servers shucked those oysters in less than two minutes.  I was impressed, and since my boyfriend does not like oysters, I happily enjoyed those thick oysters to myself.  YUM.  The pan roast and the etouffee are similar, but the pan roast is more creamy from what I tasted.  I preferred the pan roast better, but everything was bomb.  My boyfriend does NOT eat seafood, but he loved it.    The service was fast and friendly, and when we were done, I was actually sad to leave my seat.  The best thing I ate that weekend.  Until next time, I'll dream of pan roast with a few ice cold Coronas.",

    "text": "Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close. I've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated. I was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice. I am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :)  First came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot. PAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't. The CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here. I am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder.",

There was a party of ten ahead of us. Really who goes to an 18 seat oyster bar with a party of ten? And they insisted on sitting next to eachother. What was the point, you can't talk to everyone, just the person next to you. Them and the overweight super PDA couple in line in front of us, was really super annoying, but I still waited! Bc the food is just that good!  The first time I ate here it was also around 2-3am, but there was no wait at all. That was the perfect time to try it out. Usually there isn't a long wait in the middle of the night, just this time i had bad luck.  Next time I am finally gonna try the oysters. Oh if you order more than one thing, they don't charge you for the $5 for the split charge. They also won't charge you for an extra bowl of rice. I'm pretty sure if you just chat up the chef a bit they do that often.  We haven't ever finished the pan roast in one sitting, so we always get the rest to go, and we always get a hotel room with a kitchen, so leftovers don't get wasted! They also do to go if you don't want to sit next to the drunk or crazy person that they sat you next to!  Can't wait until we go back next month. It's always our first stop!",

Their gumbo was also ridiculously salty when I had it, and it was only bearable when eaten with a lot of rice.  On the flip side, their chowder is really good! And their oysters are a hit or miss. One time they tasted frozen (perhaps just iced too long) but another time their clams and oysters were on point.

Came here on a MONDAY night at 9pm thinking... the wait can't be that bad. Wrong! Despite this, many people will wait and for good reason: the food is pretty darn GOOOOD.  We were seated after about an hour and it took another hour to finally get our food. They make everything to order and make it right in front of you, so I guess that's pretty cool.  I got the combo pan roast and an order of 6 oysters. Oysters were surprisingly good for being in the desert! Mmmm.... wish I could have some right now.  Combo pan roast had shrimp, lobster and crab. So glad I got the combo with shrimp bc the whole pan roast is really creamy, and just having lobster or crab would have been too mushy! The seafood tastes so fresh. I would say this meal is really heavy though..next time I may just share with someone and enjoy something else on the side.   I got spicy level 5 to be safe but I wish I got 7 or 8. 5 wasn't really spicy at all to me. It did not have the slightest kick. I guess it's my fault for not getting it spicier.  The service was okay. The chef made no effort to conceal his tiredness and apparent annoyance with his job. I also feel like they're so understaffed. When people are done eating and leave, it can take them a while to clean up and seat the next starving party.  You should definitely check this place out if you haven't :)",

Funny turn of events but I had won money on the Monopoly machine while waiting in line for a seat at the restaurant and when it was time to eat, printed out the voucher. I unknowingly left the voucher in my pocket so the next day, had to come back to the hotel to cash out and figured I mind as well eat here again because it was that good!  So this review combines both my experiences at Oyster Bar, what a steal!  Day 1:  Dinner time Wed Night - 1 hour wait  Yes, there is limited seating here. They also don't allow you to over order here just so they can keep customers going in and out.  To order: Dozen oysters - good but on the small side (coming back the following day, the patron next to me ordered the same but his oysters were at least twice the size of mine the previous day) Clam chowder - tastes like melted pepperjack cheese, yum Combination pan roast - $5 splitting charge, comes with rice... loaded with seafood and tastes great with the rice... this was the star of the meal hands down Shrimp cocktail - ordered this but the waitress was slammed and by the time we  had brought it to her attention, we were full off other stuff Oyster shooters - filled ours with vodka... very nice  Service was as fast as it could be. All seats were filled so things were a little bit too chaotic for my taste. Even so, not bad given the circumstances.  Day 2:  Lunch time Thurs afternoon - no wait  Ended up ordering completely new items.  To order: Dozen clams - much meatier than oysters, can't say I prefer them over oysters though Shrimp cocktail - pretty standard, not presented very nicely though Gumbo - this one grows on you for sure, not a big fan after the first bite but it got progressively tastier as the meal went on  Service as expected was more attentive (as there were less people). There is a chef here that doesn't seem to enjoy his job so that was a bit off putting.  All in all, the food really takes center stage here. I really felt like I was getting my money's worth by eating here not once, but twice. I'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "I started going to Oyster Bar a few years ago. Every time I eat there I always rave about how OMG amazing it is to friends and family, and I'm sure whoever has also eaten there does the same... so naturally the place has become exponentially as popular as it was a few years ago! But its definitely worth the wait! and now its 24 hrs.  :)  I always get #1. Alaskan Chowder The Alaskan Chowder is the New England clam chowder base and has lobster, crab, shrimp, and clams in shell. Its basically clam chowder on steroids!... and they probably sprinkle some crack in there too. It's so addicting and to die for!  and #2. Pan Roast (Combo) The Combo Pan Roast only has seafood, no chicken or sausage. I think if you get the meats, it changes the flavor of the stew. The consistency is so creamy and rich, and full of flavor. You can select your spicy level 1-10. I don't dare to go past level 4. I think most people get spicy 5, and its pretty spicy already.  I always want to order an extra \"to-go\" meal, because I just can't get enough of it when I'm in town... but they don't let you. :(   Until next time Oyster Bar... I'll see you in my dreams!",

But seriously, this is the OG steam kettle cooking place. I've had Ritter's in Costa Mesa and it's pretty good but this place just has that special something. Maybe the atmosphere? The fact  that you're just eating smack dab in the middle of the casino? Who knows. All I know is that the Pan Roast is amazing. Ask for a side of habanero for some extra umph and you're set. Also, the oysters were the FATTEST OYSTERS I'VE EVER HAD. They were so plump and good, they weren't like any other oysters I've had. Just look at my picture. Look.   The only drawback about this place is the wait. Because it's so small, there's almost always a wait but if you're already in Vegas, you might as well. At least you can stand and watch people gamble their life savings away?  I'll definitely come back every time I'm in Vegas. Heck, I'll come to Vegas JUST for Oyster Bar. It's just that good, everyone. It's just. That. Good.",

Googled it. AKA crayfish. When was the last time you saw a lobster the size of your thumb? Absolute crap. Great job fooling the uninformed.  The cooks were rude to other customers, admitted their ingredients were from Walmart, and asked us how we could wait that long for some crappy ass food. I agree. Food tasted like pig's feed. We must have been idiots.   Staff was horribly inefficient. It took them 3 hours to seat and feed us and 30 minutes to process our check. Save yourself time, money, and hours... Yes hours...of your life.   Pass on Oyster Bar. Overrated piece of crap. ZERO stars.",

    "text": "On my way from LA to Zion National Park, I stopped by Vegas JUST to try Oyster Bar and Oh. My. Goodness. Oyster Bar exceeded the outrageously high expectations I had put on it.  Oyster Bar is a 10-12 seat bar open 24/7 that serves super fresh seafood. People wait for hours at a time, so that should be a pretty solid indication that this place is worth starving for.  I came around 11am on Thanksgiving Day and there was no line, just four empty seats. Within the hour, a line had formed, but it only had roughly 10 people. My friends who have come here in the past have had to wait up to three hours at 3am, so I guess I chose a great time to visit this place.  For starters, they serve the largest oysters and mussels I had ever received. Never had I ever thought that a dozen oysters/mussels was worth every penny until I found this place. I saw the cooks cleaning out the oysters one-by-one, which is probably why it tasted so fresh and flavorful.  For our main entrees, we ordered the Jambalaya (2 stars) and Combo Pan Roast (5+ Stars). Oh man, I would rate the Combo Pan Roast a million billion stars if I could. The Jambalaya truly sucked-- bland, ordinary, unappetizing. On the other hand, the Combo Pan Roast was like seafood heaven in every bite. I had to take spoonfuls of the Combo Pan Roast and spread it onto my Jambalaya to give that thing some taste.  Overall, even though the Jambalaya isn't worth more than 2 stars at best, The oysters, mussels, and Combo Pan Roast more than made up for it. If you come to visit, try to come by 6am - 11am, that's usually when lines are the shortest.",

Met some people along the way at the bar and they said the food was on point  Oysters were fresh, gumbo and jambalaya were very good and flavorful.. Got to try this donkey pictured hot sauce called the \"ass kickin\" hot sauced and within a taste of two drops in my jambalaya i felt like i just got out of the steam room!!  Beers were very good, except they had budlight, theres also a special price between midnight to 9am or something i forgot.

So we decided to order to-go which in order for us to order to-go we must sit. So while my husband babysits my toddler, i sat to order. The lady say maximum of two orders per person and i go my husband is here and cannot sit because i have a two year old. Then she go as long as your husband shows up i can order more than two (i was planning to order 4). So when i was about to order, her co worker BRENDA who seem unfriendly, unhospitable and rude said -- no i cannot order more than two and if husb shows up, need to go on the back of the line! Im like wth, so i just ordered for two. The other customers sitting next to me were shaking their head as if they could not believe it. Im a paying customer who fall in line like everyone did. There was an available chair next to me. Why give a bad service and ruin the name of the restaurant just because of your \"rules or policies.\" If you're the manager or owner of this restaurant, please contact me. I'll be happy to let you know how your employees can improve their service. The other lady (Joana) was nice but Brenda is focused on her task than giving a good service. I believe you have to be able to balance or provide great service than just performing task. I hope you take my criticisms positively. The way she told the lady taking my order was rude, please review the video cameras. I am not trying to abide the law, but asking nicely since i have toddler with us and can not enjoy dining due to that.  PS. So Brenda Aka not happy with her job lol gave me my bill without saying anything nor looking at me, as if she had personal problem with me. Thats how miserable she was with me trying to order more than i should. She converses to customers to my right and to my left, while to me not even smile nor look. Again-- owners and manager please look at the camera. Thank you.   Food: I had this dish in Orange county california. Ritters and Kettlebar does it better",

We waited in line for about two hours before being seated. While I am accustomed to the wait, our pan roasts were hardly edible. There literally were crab leg shells in every bite we took. I'm used to there being a couple shells in the bowl, but literally every mouthful ended with me picking shells remnants out of my mouth. Our rice was also extremely over cooked, to the point where it was sticking together in a mound. We ate what we could, and threw the rest out. I always preferred the Palace Station location for the food quality (despite the wait), but I doubt I will be back. The Texas Station location has yet to let me down like this.",

But it's clean and the staff there knows exactly what they are doing.  We had the combo pan roast with rice, and clam chowder dirty style. The dirty clam chowder was perfect because 1. I couldn't decide between red or white and 2. The white ended up just being too thick and creamy for me. The red chowder broke up the richness and gave a nice balance.  We also ordered some raw oysters- I was pleased with how well they were cleaned.  The clam chowder was deliciius but the combo pan roast stole the show. You won't regret it!!",

I slurped them with lemon and Tabasco and was completely satisfied. I didn't ask which kind of oysters they were and was full aware they weren't of the shigoku or Kumamoto type. But they were cheap during moonlight special and still very fresh. No complaints.  I waited for my level 5 combo pan roast and today was he first time of coming here at least 6 times that I finished! I was so thrilled and enjoyed every bite. The flavor was incredible and hit the spot.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were able to come here during our Vegas trip and it was our favorite meal of the weekend!   We came around 6pm on a Saturday night and there were a couple of parties ahead of us. The line did take awhile and we ended up waiting arounf 40-50 minutes, but it was worth it. Waiting in the middle of a casino isn't a fun experience, so make sure you're with good company.  When you get seated, they start you off with a dinner roll. This was just okay. Save yourself for the good stuff. I regret eating half my dinner roll.  We ordered a dozen oysters ($20) and the combo pan roast ($24) to share. They ended up giving us two bowls of rice and didn't charge us a ($5) splitting fee. Maybe it was because we ordered a dozen oysters and also two 23oz Blue Moons ($10 each). I almost ordered a clam chowder, but good thing I didn't because we were stuffed! The pan roast was delicious with a very generous portion of seafood. There was plenty of crab, shrimp, and lobster. Real lobster. Not crawfish. We got the pan roast spicy level 6 and it was perfect for us. We like our food on the spicier side. It had a great kick. The oysters were HUGE. The biggest oysters I've ever had. They weren't fishy at all, but I did feel like they were a little bland since they were so big. I tried putting a good amount of cocktail sauce on them as well. I know the have HH for the oysters from 1am-9am, but I would just come during non-HH hours and get the dozen oysters for the same deal. I can imagine myself getting super hangry waiting during HH.  The service was great. The lady who helped us was very sweet and had a really positive attitude.   We will definitely come back whenever we have a chance.",

Can never finish a dish and always happen to take it home and finishing it all and needing more. All the dishes taste good but tried 5 from a simple menu of less than 15.  V V recommend  Pan Roast- comes with a bowl of rice or substitute for pasta for more (a must get dish every time I come)  Bouillabaisse- when going with another person order this with the pan roast   Oysters on half shell- so fresh and sweet each time   Warning! There are less than 10 seats so you will have to wait a long time since this place is popular.  Shortest wait time: 30 min Longest wait time: 2.5 hours   Prices aren't cheap but can't wait to go back!!",

The only thing that I don't like is the fact it is located inside the Palace hotel casino where everyone is smoking. The wait was not too terrible, although I waited in line around hour and half ish on a Monday night around 7pm. We ordered the dozen clams, diavlo, pan roast (combo), and gumbo all at level 8 spiciness, I think I could have just went for the 10, but I am the type to enjoy eating ghost peppers, so choose according to your level that you are able to handle. Clams are super fresh, but not sure what part of the ocean it is. I would not say it is the best (the best is when I had clams in Chelsea market in New York), but definitely a good substitute. My favorite dish is the diavlo by far, then the pan roast and lastly the gumbo. I was not a huge fan of the gumbo, but I don't like okras so if you don't like okras I suggest not ordering it. Overall, I would come back, if given the opportunity.",

They must put crack in it or something, it is addictive.  There are only a few generic wines to choose from, but wine is really not necessary when you can drink the Pan Roast instead.   There are only a limited number of seats to sit at, so sometimes you have to wait a while, but it is worth it, and the service is good because there are only a limited number of seats to sit at.",

They basically serve up this cajun stews with lots of seafood and a bar at the Palace Station. Of course along with it you can get some fresh oysters, bloody mary oyster shooters and a few other typical things. The pan roast is what they're famous for which is this creamy mixture of spice and seafood.  Just some notes.   1. Its a bar so there isn't much seating 2. There's only 6 cooking stations so only 6 people get served at a time. 3. Watch out for the spice level, because level 7 made me pay the next morning ... twice. 4. Prepare to wait, see above.",

    "text": "wow, seriously!! Who'd of thunk I could get yummy good quality seafood in a small (I mean small) eatery at Palace Station of all places.  This little bar area right by the slots literally seats about like 20 people at one time.  The waiting does suck a little.. because even though there are two empty seats available, if there's a party of three in front of you, those seats will stay empty.  Advice - I heard them say you're allowed to cut the line as long as the people in front of you are ok w/it.  The food's expensive, no getting away from that.. food ranges from $15 - $25.  I should say, it looks expensive when you see where the food's coming from.    Food:    Appetizers:  raw clams or oysters of the half shell, caesar salar w/or w/o shrimp or chicken, alaskan chowder, manhattan or new england clam chowder  Main courses:  different kinds of gumbo, cioppino, steamed little neck clams, different kinds of pan roasts  to name a few.. and then specials everyday.  I shared some oysters w/ my friends.  They were on the small side but definitely NOT lacking in flavor.  They come w/spicy horse radish and lots of different types of hot sauces to pick from - red's, tabasco, all the classics!  I had a cup of their new england clam chowder which was definitely worth it, one of the best I've ever had, so creamy and sweet!  I shared the house gumbo w/my friend which came w/lobster, crab, shrimp, sausage and chicken.  It's a massive bowl of food, great to share.  Here's a good hint:  it's a little on the saucy side, but if you squirt lemon juice in it, it so makes the dish so much better.  The service was good, and fast.  Our waitress was fast, liked to joke around with us, and ifs he wasn't around, the chef who's cooking in front of everyone is more than happy to help you out.  What's cool is the chef cooks everything in these cone like pots.  He's cooking different types of gumbo and soups in each one and once he's done plating, he turns the pot downwards and rinses it w/water n starts again.  A gem in the middle of a hotel/casino that's most likely not on your list of places to visit while you're in Vegas, but I tell you, the wait and the trip here is well worth it!!",

I ate my freshly shucked oysters with tabasco and they were really good. Kind of reminded me of home (FL). The gumbo had a really good flavor and full of seafood.

Fortunately, there were 5 seats still open when we got there.  By the time we finished our meal, a line of vultures was already forming to swoop for our prime spots.  I had the Level 5 seafood pan roast and it was perfect for me (Not a huge fan of spicy food, but can tolerate)  Bursting with flavor, the boiling plump seafood was just what the doctor ordered for a cold winter day in Vegas.  The oysters were fresh and quite plump as well, but the star of the show is definitely the pan roast.  A nice stroll afterwards... in the crisp outside winter air... with your new friend warming you up inside...hits the spot perfectly!  Not sure I'd eat this during the scorching summer.  This place deserves 6 stars for the contraption they use to cook the pan roast.  Cook, pour, rinse, repeat...  SO EFFICIENT!",

I've brought many friends along to try it and they all loved it.  I don't eat oysters but my bf loves their oysters and says that they are one of the freshest he's ever had, and I do see how huge their oysters are compared to other places.

The portion is definitely big enough for one starving guy (from the long line) or sharing for 2 if you are planning to try bit of everything.   There's a BUT, seating is really really limited and the line was very long but in the end, totally worth the wait.",

Not so good things - very long wait...90 minutes, only 18 seats, only one waitress to clear plates, take orders, and cash out people out.  If you aren't in a rush and you love good seafood, you will love the oyster bar!",

I got here around 12:15pm on a tues no wait plus I was by myself but there were like 6 open seats available. I finish eating and left at 12:55pm and there was now a line of 10 people at least lol just sharing my thoughts because I do not like waiting for anything so my hubby brought me the right time in and out lol.",

We arrived around 10pm and the line was still 45 minutes long. There are only a certain amount of stools to sit on. I asked what ocean the fish and shellfish was from and the man had a smart ass answer for me but it's okay. I just prefer not to eat fish full of radiation from the Pacific Ocean.   Everything we ordered was great and I also liked their beer and wine selection. If you are in the mood to wait a while for some grub, this is the spot.",

As soon as I turned 21 I made my point to become a regular here. My go to meals are combo pan roast and Alaskan  clam chowder. My absolute favorite chef is Ricardo he's fast and the taste is like no other. JJ is really good as well and you know it's gonna be good if he's cooking. Bob is really good too but he's definitely heavy on the spice so go down a few levels when your dining with Bob. I recently tried the etouffee and I must say I was highly impressed and I have now added it to my rotation of meals. There's 18 seats at the table and it's open 24 hours and 99.99% of the time there is definitely a wait. But if you appreciate good food like I do you'll find the time to wait",

    "text": "Its really good, I was doubtful because of its location and because there are so many choices in Las Vegas and wow, this place is amazing.  I know the line is long but its definitely worth the 1 hour-ish wait.  After our first try, we came here three night in a row to have more of the amazing food.  This is definitely nothing fancy as Guy Savoy, but it is definitely authentic Southern style seafood.  I love this type of no frill food joint.  Just good food without the expensive tag.  During our visits, I tried most of the items on the menu.  First off, you get to pick level 1 to 10 for your food's spicyness.  I go for 1 or 0 simply because I dont' like spicy food.  The dinner roll is complimentary, and it is the standard sourdough roll, served warm with butter.  Their Clam Chowder is actually not that good, too powdery taste. I don't know why others liked it, I didn't.  Not enough clam in it too.  I like Boudin's Clam Chowder better when compare to similiar level.  Their Bouillabaisse is good, you can choose between rice or noodle, it is tomato based soup with all of the seafoods (Lobster, Crab, Shrimp, Clams, Mussels, Fish..etc), which is their #2 signature item.  #1 most popular item is their combo roast.  It is thicker in terms of broth, but it goes really well with rice.  You get to pick your favorite toppings but combo roast comes with shrimp, crab, and lobster, which is better in my opinion than the Palace Roast (with chicken).  Its little bit spicy for me but the bold taste of the seafood is one of the best I had for years.  My personal favorite goes to the Shrimp Scampi with Pasta.  Its the clam soup with melted butter and loads of tiger shrimp.  Its so heavenly.  I would order extra noodle next time when I go to satisfy my crave.  Tip: There's no tip as in when the lines will be shorter, its really your luck but the chef really matters alot.  Even the materials/ingredients are all the same, but chef really made the difference.  During our 3 visits, this fat chef whose always happy did the best job.  His shrimp scampi is out of this world yet another chef always seems piss at something...did a very sloppy job, my scampi was dry and soup-less.  Good luck waiting and don't lose too much money on slots while waiting in line!",

    "text": "OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE LONG WAIT!!!!!  If you're drunk and with your friends waiting, time will fly by fast. The way the place is laid out is in the casino area of Palace Station, literally looks like a little bar area, and seats no more than 15-20 people, TOPS. My friend, bf and I waited like an hour. LADIES, make sure you switch your heels from the club/dayclub with some comfy flip flops or flats!!!! You will thank me later.   I have this tendency where I order too much food when I'm drunk, but with waiting for an hour, WHO CARES?!!! SO NOW ONTO THE FOOD!!!!  OYSTER SHOOTERS: MMM YUMMY. Super refreshing AND OYSTERS WERE FRESH TO DEATH. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.   COMBO PAN ROAST: My friend and I got one each... and it was sooooo goood. It came with shrimp, lobster and crab and the texture of the orange stewy sauce was soooo succulent and eating it with the scoop of rice they give you on top is just simply amazing.   BOUILLABAISSE: My boyfriend got this, and it had noodles in it and was a little more soupy but still had some stewy texture. He says it's HIGHLY COMPARABLE to bouillabaisse in the EAST COAST and Oyster Bar is the best place for it on the westside.   ALASKAN CLAM CHOWDER:  OMG THIS CHOWDER IS SO GOOD. PROBABLY THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It comes with shrimp, crab, lobster, and of course, CLAMS, and the chowder is so RICH in flavor and the PERFECT AMOUNT of saltiness. GET IT MANHATTAN STYLE or New England style.   Be ready to pass out for about an hour or two before you rage some more... this place hits the spot and is definitely amazing COMFORT FOOD. Even the NEXT MORNING we reheated all of the leftovers in our hotel and it still tasted SO AMAZING. I URGE YOU to make time for this place if you're a seafood and stew lover if you're ever in VEGAS.   Hope this helped! ;)",

We went at 8AM... because the law of the universe states that all children under 5 must wake up before 7AM and be asleep before 10PM.  Sadly, state law means no kids on the casino floor. Happily, each person in line is allowed to order TWO items to go.   Hubby ordered a gumbo and an alaskan chowder to go... and we ate it at the Grand Cafe.  I have never been a fan of gumbo... but it was really very good. The soup mixed with the rice, really changed it into something divine.   The chowder was overflowing with seafood. I didn't find a single bit of potato or other fillers. It was lobster, shrimp, scallop, clam, king crab... I couldn't believe how much seafood that had put into this chowder!  The kids loved it too... I hope they don't become too picky about chowder in the future =)  My 5 year old kept telling me how she LOVED the lobster.",

I got the combo pan roast like everyone suggested on yelp and there was nothing good to say about it except for the 3 pieces of lobster that was in there and the few shrimp. You could barely see any crab meat in there. The rice that came with it was soggy and clumpy and not enough when comparing the pan roast and rice ratio.   Pros:  -It was just a short walk away since I was staying at the hotel. -the waitress and cook were nice   Cons: based on the combo pan roast that I got.  -rice, way too soggy and clumpy, and not enough for the pan roast. -the combo pan roast was overpriced for what you get. Only 3 pieces of lobster, just a few shrimp, and hardly any crab meat. -long line, long wait (not at all worth it). Save your money for something better or spend a little more for a nice buffet.",

I don't love oysters but my fiance does and these were hard for him to eat...maybe huge oysters are a good thing for some people, but not for us. :(  We ordered the pan roast with lobster, shrimp, and crab. It was good, but I felt the crab got lost in the whole thing. The tomato base was creamy and delicious and because we were sharing, they brought us an extra rice at no charge! The bread that came with the meal was soft and crusty. yum!  Anyway, the pricing was a little steep but its vegas and theyre opened all the time so a premium is understood.  I'll probably be back if im in the mood for pan roast in vegas :)",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this place actually deserves 5 stars, but one major flaw made me knock it down one.  That flaw: There are 18 seats. Which translates to a minimum wait time of 1 hour... we waited 2 and a half.  YES, 2 and a half hours standing in line in the middle of a casino to eat at this tiny little bar that serves amazing food. I rarely ever find myself in line for that long for any other reason. I wouldn't even wait that long to get a blowjob from Justin Bieber. That's just a ridiculously long time, and yet... I was still blown away.  The food is Cajun themed and serves a variety of Creole style food. I ordered the Jambalaya(+++), others in my party ordered the Seafood Bake(++), Gumbo, and Cioppino (fish stew+++). Aside from the Gumbo, which was a tad salty, the food was the best damn Creole food I've ever had.  The food is cooked in individual pans that are cooked right in front of you by a single chef. This dude runs around like a maniac, doing all the prepping, seasoning, oyster-shucking, clam-steaming, and rice-cooking. He is a machine and yet still so friendly. He kept working at a furious pace, but would still be able to converse with the seated individuals. He would be the an amazing bartender if he could mix drinks like the way he cooks.  All the ingredients are fresh, and the oysters are individually wrapped to ensure quality every time. After deciding upon a spiciness level (1-10) you get to watch the master work. Side note: I ordered a 4, and am a big fan of spicy food. I figured if it wasn't hot enough, I'll just add more hot-sauce. It was pretty darn perfect. A nice kick, but not too over-powering. My fellow diners ordered a 5 and 6, and the 6 was starting to get pretty intense.  The portions are huge, I finished only 2/3 of my Jambalaya and was shocked 'cause I have been left to starve and wince in hunger for 2 hours prior. The presentation is simple, but due to the quality and quantity of the food, it looked absolutely delicious.  Overall, I would say this is definitely an AMAZING hidden secret in Vegas. But the Palace Station is off-strip and a little annoying to take a cab just for this meal. But if you ever find yourself in the area and are down for some GREAT seafood, this should definitely be an option... just be prepared to wait an ungodly amount of time.",

    "text": "The drive from LA to Vegas is brutal.  Well, not horrible, but sitting in a car for 3.5 - 4 hours deserves some kind of reward.  When planning our Vegas trip, of course one of the first things we do is decide what and where we'll eat during the weekend.  This place was the first one on the list.  It had been on both of our bookmarks for a long while.  It seemed only fitting to treat ourselves to a delicious meal from Oyster Bar after our long drive from LA.  We read the Yelp reviews and knew that we had to hit this place up when we got into town.  We would be arriving at about 1-2am, and according to the reviews, probably the best time to avoid the wait.  After searching the casino, we found this little tiny bar.  Yes people, the reviews are all True.  It's tiny.  It's basically a bar with seats around it (about 18 or so).  Get in line to be seated, and be prepared for a wait.    Of course, by the time we were seated, we knew exactly what we were going to order.  One combo pan roast and 6 oysters.  It was 2am in the morning, and I was struggling with the concept of sleep and enjoying my delicious meal.  But this meal was too amazing to pass up.  The oysters came, and my friend and I had three each.  Paired with the cocktail sauce and horseradish, those oyster were a great prelude to our meal.  The oysters were fresh and at $10 for 6 (midnight special), it was well worth it.  The pan roast.  OMG the pan roast.  If you come here and can't decide what to order, just order the pan roast.  You won't be sorry.  My friend and I shared the plate.  There's a $5 sharing fee, but you get two scoops of rice instead of the one it's usually served with.  Besides, we could not have finished one each anyways.  We ordered a 5 level spicy, and that was good enough for me.  Not too spicy, just enough that you know there's some spice in the dish.  Yes, order the pan roast.  You won't be sorry!!  Great meal for the start of our Vegas trip.",

I order half dozen raw oyster (the oyster pretty big) n 1 dozen of raw clam, clam chowder and the clam steamer. Everything was so good. It's located at the palace station casino. I like how the counter sit is. So if u come to Vegas stop by and give it try. Price is cheap too.",

Our waitress was Sandra and she was a total sweetheart.  I had a dozen oysters and the house gumbo while my friends had various versions of the pan roast. The portions are HUGE, like a large sized bowl of pho. I recommend you share an entree with someone and then order some oysters.  AWESOME FOOD. AMAZING SERVICE.",

    "text": "The wait is ridiculous. Granted it was 1pm on a Saturday. If you plan it right, you'll probably not have to wait 3 hours to finish your meal. You begin to share a sense of camaraderie with those in line with you (and a bit of frustration as there are three seats open but a group of four at the head of the line).   I got the Combo Pan Roast, medium. It was delicious and had excellent flavor. The chef behind the counter was obviously overworked and needed a break. His attempts to smile were a bit sad, but the food he produced was great. At one point he threw up his hands, walked out of the small restaurant area, walked across the casino, and disappeared for 5 minutes. This was while my food was still cooking and slowly evaporating away. I was genuinely concerned that I'd never get to eat.  Stop by if you have some time and are willing to travel to Palace Station. Be prepared to wait at meal times and try to keep your group smaller.",

The food is very tasty and made to perfection!   Only downside is that you have to wait a while for your food to be done. Mainly because they make it fresh right there in front of you so thats the only down side but overall the food is amazing!!!   For all those seafood lovers this is the place where you want to get your fill of it. They had chunks in every bite which is great!!  Definitely go and try this place out if yoru in town. I also got the clam chowder which was amazing!   Its really small place so make sure you plan an arriving early for your  dinner or you have to wait a while.",

As far as being worth the wait...that's VERY questionable. We waited about an hour for a party of 2 on a Monday evening. When seated, we ordered the New England clam chowder (I've definitely had better :/ ), the oysters and clams on the half shell (clams were shredded to pieces and not even shucked properly, oysters were just average), and we also ordered the combo pan roast (although there was a decent amount of seafood present, I wouldn't say that it was worth the hour wait!) service was alright, just a little sloppy. This place is definitely not worth the wait for the quality of food served. I would definitely prefer the Oyster Bar at Harrah's any day!",

So grab some beers and strike up a conversation with the people in line with you because its going to be a while before you sit. It is well worth it ...",

Service has it's good days and bad and each chef has different spice level, I've had a level 10 spice from one and a level 5 from another you might want to ask the waitress.  Items I love to eat here are steamed clams, raw oysters, and Combo Pan Roast. I've tried the Gumbo which is really good and the raw clams which were ok.   It is a bar so no kids have seen may people try and be refused. I have tried other Station properties but none compare.",

The servers were very friendly and welcoming upon sitting down. Food orders were taken promptly. Drinks were refilled before I could ask for a refill, And the food was over-the-top amazingly delicious. I had the house gumbo, which was more amazing than I thought it would be. They let you choose the spiciness level for your dish, so I chose a four and it was perfectly spicy. They do not skimp on seafoods. It was rich and shrimp lobster crab and clams, of course sausage too. I don't know what the other ingredients are for gumbo but this was so good. It was served with a small amount of rice. I also had half a dozen oysters. The only thing about the oysters as they were kind of small in size but they were deliciously fresh with the horse radish cocktail sauce and tobasco.",

The line is always ridiculously long so I decided to come at 2am on a Thursday night, still waited an hour to get seated, but when I was leaving at 3am there was no wait so I guess that's the time you need to come if you don't want to wait in line. I am never a fan for oyster but people I've come with said their oyster is very good! But gumbo is a must-get if you come here, there is spice level 1-10, people seem to like it spicy but I like my gumbo at spice level 4 just so that my anus wont explode during my trip.

Not sure if I would come back just for the oysters as there are other places that are better priced. Would definitely come back for the combo pan roast though. Full of flavor and the sauce was amazing and it also comes with a side of white rice!  limited seating and not the most comfortable seats. Not sure any restaurant is worth an hour and a half wait. Will be coming back to try their cioppino also as that looked extremely yummy.",

Then we started getting our own bowl (I swear it tastes even better the next day, like how pizza or chipotle does). I started getting a level 10 and it still wasn't spicy to me. The last time I went I asked for a number 15! Haha she said that's called habanero level anything greater than 10. It was more spicy and tastes even better. If you love spicy get habanero level! Mmmm. Craving now.   I ate the oyster here everytime. My gf loves it and says its her favorite place for oysters. I can't really tell the difference between oysters but she recommends it!",

Steve cleans up an area and we are called up to our seats!! Mind you I am clueless as to what kind of food this is only that I wanted oysters and the aroma of spices is amazing. Luckily our bar neighbor gives us a quick rundown of how it works with his recommendations on the menu, I ordered the palace combo with seafood and chicken and sausage my love ordered the combo. When we asked for oysters Steve recommended that we pass on these oysters as they were from a secondary supplier and not of grade A like they usually serve. So he recommends the clams. We happily agree. Then right in front of us chef D throws butter a scoop of garlic into one of the pans in front of us!! In go the clams with clam stock and it starts to boil!!! If only there was smell-a-pic. Anyways that's just the beginning I will let your imagination take over as to how amazing the rest of the meal went!!! If you are ever on Vegas this is a MUST DO!!!",

I know the wait can be long it is only an \"oyster bar\" after all, but all worth it. So know you have to be prepared to wait. I can't ding them for that,you can only go so fast with limited seating. Go hungry because portions are plentiful! Pan roast, oysters, chowder etc. all good dependent on your mood!",

    "text": "They really need to come up with a better system for patrons waiting in line. Customers are literally standing in line for over an hour to eat at this establishment. My first question is: Why does such a highly reputed business only seat 16 people? Is there room for expansion? Might be a good idea. Secondly: Why are customers waiting in line? I'm comfortable with the notion that a restaurant reserves the right to refuse reservations. However, these days we have many reliable means of communicating with a wait list. For example, when someone comes in person to dine, they could be given a buzzer or sent a text message to let them know when space is available. That would allow patrons their precious time, to gamble or do with it as they wish. I sincerely hope these suggestions can be implemented as soon as possible. There is simply no excuse to alienate your entire customer base with this preposterous infrastructure any further.",

Seating is limited, they only have bar seating. There is a constant wait here and no chairs for people waiting, you have to stand the whole time. With so many great places to eat in Vegas, it's just too difficult to rate this place any higher or want to return based on the wait time alone. For me, it's not worth it, sorry.",

    "text": "5 stars for the food  2 stars for restaurant operations 4 stars overall  I went with 3 other friends at 11pm on a  Friday night and ended up waiting 2 .5 hours before getting seated.  (On another visit I went with another friend on a Sat. at 2 pm but didn't get seated until 3:30 pm.)  The place seemed chronically understaffed with 2 - 3 visible employees were working very hard to cook the dishes, shell the oysters, serve the drinks and clear the tables seemingly without any breaks.  Turnover was super slow and inefficient with some dirty dishes sitting around up to 15 - 20 minutes before they would be cleared off the counter before another patron could be seated. Once seated, there'd be a lag before they'd come to get our drink orders, then some more lag before they take our food orders, followed by even more lag before the food comes out.  I see the cook and another lady working nonstop so I know they are probably doing the best that they can (on occasion another woman comes out to help clear some dirty dishes).   While in line, I keep pacing the length of the bar to see how many more seats are opening up. I also can't help but tell my friends how I'd run the place if I were the manager/owner and could add employees and expand space dramatically and/or have chain locations just to accommodate all the patrons without excessive waits. I'd also implement policies/procedures to eradicate all the inefficiencies and increase sales and customer satisfaction.   But alas, when the food does come out, it does not disappoint.  We shared the combo pan roast, the jambalaya, the bouillabase and the gumbo and Bloody Mary oyster shooters.  The flavors are bold and strong, even a little on the salty side, but it really hits the spot. The pan roast and the jambalaya were such satiating comfort foods for my famished belly. The seafood tasted so good. The gumbo and the bouillabase were good but not exceptional. The oyster shooters were just normal.  The prices seem a little high at around $20 something per dish, but the portions are hearty and 4 people can easily share 3 dishes and still be full.  Despite the wait, I feel that everyone should try the Oyster Bar at least once. Although I don't like dining by myself, if you don't mind eating by yourself, sometimes they'll let the single diners cut in line and eat first.",

Don't be fool by the decor outside the hotel because the food here is so fresh and delicious.  The seafood's is also very fresh and the price is not that expensive either.  I had the Seafood Tower (Oyster, Lobster, Crab Leg and White Crab meat) and Crab Caesar Salad which was amazing.  I wanted to order the Combo Pan Roast (which has Seafood combination),but I was to full. I would recommend this place, but keep in mind that there will be a wait, so be patience because it worth it.

    "text": "5 star means REALLY REALLY good food. The price and service better be pretty damn good too. It's a big deal giving 5 stars but I want to explain. If you want really good seafood, it's going to cost an arm and a leg, unless you make it yourself. The combo pan roast (shrimp, lobster and crab) is really outstanding. And, even with the $5 sharing charge (who cares people!!!) and the extra $2 for the pasta instead of rice, it is WELL WORTH the money. I can probably make something like this at home, but it wont be this. I've had it before here and it is consistent and delicious. Substituting the pasta instead of rice is THEE way to go. It completely transforms the meal.  The ceasar salad is crisp, cold and very tasty.  The wait. Oh boy. That can be killer. The first time I went, we waited a little over an hour. Despite that, we LOVED the pan roast. Instead of being disappointed with it after such a long wait, it was even better than we thought! Yesterdays' wait = 3 minutes!!! AWESOME! The service is Ok. It's not table service. It's NOT fine dining. NOT AT ALL. But I dont come here for that. It's in the dumpiest dump of a casino, it reeks and the clientele are local drunks and weirdos. But, once you take a bite of the pan roast, you WILL forget where you are. You will savour every bite!",

Spicy food + heavy cream before going out, I know, bad idea.

One order is plenty of food for two people and I forgot why, but they were having a $1 Bud Light night for some reason. Still hungry, then just load up on the delicious, warm, pillowy sourdough rolls.  No frills, good service, good food.",

    "text": "Ill start my recent vegas trip's reviews from top to bottom.  This was my favorite meal.  We went on a whim and remembering Davy F highly recommending it.  I happen to be on Sahara coming from nearby trader joes.  It was about 3pm and we had dinner reservations at 7p so we were debating on whether to eat or hold off.  My wife is a Casino snob and will not enter a casino off the strip unless i force her too.  She took a look at PS and said WTH are we doing here.  I said lets try the Oyster bar, my friends says its good.  She gave me that evil looking.  But we both glad we did.  It didn't start out good as we found it wasn't a real restaurant but a counter with about 20 seats.  There was also a line about 7 parties deep.  I could see more and more steam coming out of her head.  Since i picked the place, so I told her go play something.  So she went on her way.  About 45-60min later we finally got seated.  By this time she wasn't talking to me, saying we are gonna eat again in a few hours.  So i said let share a dish.  We decided on 1/2 dozen oysters and a cioppino.  The oysters were good and fresh.  They were a good starter.  The cioppino, in my opinion was one of the best i tasted.  The sauce had the perfect consistency, and tasted perfect.  There was an abundance of crab, shrimp, clams, and mussels.  And they give you steamed white rice.....YES!  its amazing the cook and server can handle that countertop alone.  Of course they have the runners doing the behind the scene work, but the two of them cooking and serving in perfect harmony.    This is not a place to sit, eat and talk story.  You eat and run, so if the person glaring at you standing in line because you are taking your sweet ass time, you know why.  This place is great for single diners.  You probably can get a seat in half the time.",

Oh man, the House Pan Roast is delicious!  It's a huge portion...I couldn't finish it, I didn't complain when I had it for dinner too.  Be careful with getting too confident with the amount of spiciness that you request for.  I got a 6 and it was good, I was able to enjoy my food with a hint of spiciness.   One of the fun things is that you get to watch your food get cooked in front of you.  You can see all the passion that's put into each order.  The staff is friendly and pretty funny, love it when they have a sense of humor.  We also got the Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters, they were yummy too. I'll be heading back here!",

This line would not budge, so we left. :*(  But, that stirred up my curiosity and decided to come at an off-time (they're open 24 hours) after some Vegas debauchery.   Ordered the combo (crab, lobster, shrimp) pan roast with level 7 spiciness (levels 1-10), which was a pretty mild spicy.   I was intrigued by the old fashion boilers in front <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=i6GMotN-jpqlLc9gpmjgEw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4...</a>, as I saw the chef start off by cooking the fresh seafood medley in the boiler, then added the cajun seasoning, the broth, and finally kept adding the cream sauce base/roux.   The pan roast had strong flavor, where I think adding extra rice or noodles ($1.99) is essential. I actually think this soup would make a really delicious pasta sauce. And then there were juicy and generous clumps of seafood, very yum.   Service was attentive (you're sitting right in front of them) and the chef kept asking when would be the next time he'll be seeing me, and I assured him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday. (I wish) I definitely will be back to try the infamous gumbo, clam chowder, and (new york) oysters/shooters.",

SERVICE: I came here Saturday around 12:30. the line is about 10 people head of me. it's a long wait there is only 3 people i noticed working in the front  the CHEF , BUSBOY and the WAITRESS.   we waited for an hour to get seated and after you get seated we waited for another less than an hour to get served. basically it tooks us more or less 3 hours before we get our food . when you get seated do not assumed that you get your food right away.  The Chef cooks your food per order , depending how much spice you like . and it takes forever because he is the one who opens the oyster at the bar if you order it.   His cooking is pretty routine , since hes been doing it over and over . and he cleans the pot every meal he served .thumbs up for that !  Waiter is pretty nice and joke around once in a while , but i guess when you waited for long all you want is great food and gimmmmeee my food.  FOOD:  *COMBO PAN ROAST -  spice level 8, seafood with lobster.  its really spicy but i love spicy food . the ingredients he used are all frozen sea food since I saw him refilling all the container with all the frozen seafoods and meat. although he have seasoning. the cream he mixed already pre made of him probably since he took it out from the containe and he does add it at the end after he saute all the ingredients in the butter and added a stocked and reduced it. The flavor is really creamy and alot of seafood in my pot, alot of flavor but i cant say its not  the best one. big portion enough for 2 people  *PALACE PAN ROAST-  this one is with chicken , sausage , shrimp , crab and shrimp except lobster. level 5 , nice heat and spice . bug portion enough for 2 people  *FRESH OYSTER IN HALF SHELL: AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! This is a complete waste of money . since we are very hungry waited for 2 hours we decided to order oyster while waiting . and we ordered a dozen . the oyster are pretty big, literally big and fatty . so tasteless and it has the taste of a jelly . after 2 piece it makes me gag . no matter how much i put lemon or horse radish to remove the awful taste and texture . this one will completely ruin your appetite. We ordered a dozen and boy this is a complete nasty texture and taste and it doesn't taste fresh at all more of jello fat texture with very bland taste . in short undeniable worst oyster I have ever had.  TIPS: you can share order but you have they will charge extra 5$ for other person , since its big portion maybe you can try to this , its too creamy for me that eating it all alone will make my tummy aches   you can ask them to go for you if you didnt finish it and request for rice . they dont charge you for extra rice . most of the people who eat next to us wasnt able to finish their food and have it to go after.  after few hours if you wanna eat your left over you will realized how thick the food is the cream is just overpowering and oh boy that is a complete meal for at least 3 people. not unless you have a very big appetite.   you can order take out food but you still need to get inline . how did i know ? someone asked and the chef said yes but he still need to get in line .   is it worth the wait, not really but its ok to try ...",

    "text": "We've been here twice now for the famous pan roast, and the second time I thought my stomach would literally explode.  Let me explain.  This place is #2 on Yelp's Best of Las Vegas restaurant list.  I never even knew what pan roast was until there was a Yelp Talk thread devoted to it.  Pan roast sounded like some kind of pot roast to me where beef or some meat was roasted in a pan, right?  Wrong.  Pan roast is actually like a giant bowl of lobster bisque with crab, lobster, and shrimp, if you order the combo pan roast, which is what I have gotten both times. And, with that giant bowl comes a giant spoon to eat with. Located inside the Palace Station, the Oyster Bar only seats about 16 people at a time because it is indeed a bar.  People line up patiently for their turn to be seated and served, watching their food being prepared in front of them.  The first time we went, we arrived at 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon and waited for 70 minutes.  Really.  The second time, we got there at 2:00pm on a Friday and waited about 30 minutes.  I've heard stories of people waiting for 2 hours or more.  We talked to a couple in line ahead of us who stay at the Palace Station when they visit just so they can eat at the Oyster Bar.  Service is always friendly and it's fun to speak to your fellow diners; everyone is in a good mood there, maybe because they're finally sitting down and getting their fix while other people wait in line behind them.   The bread and butter is good and so is the New England Clam Chowder.  Those are the only other items I've had there, but that's all you need to know, really.  If you've never had the pan roast, you should try it at least once so you can taste what all the fuss is about.  It's so good that you just keep eating it, even though you're full, hence the stomach-about-to-burst feeling.  Just try to go on a weekday in the mid-afternoon or some other odd time; they're open 24 hours.",

I didnt have to wait in a long line, but when we sat down, a line started to file and before you knew it all the seats were full and more than 5 people were waiting. The pricing is decent, i had the pan roast spicy #7. I didnt come hungry, but i ate ALL the food in the bowl. All fresh ingredients(you can see everything they put in it since they cook it in front of you) and they steam cook it(also, illegal in CA) so its that much better to eat here!! trust me",

Therefore, it only has 15 bar stools at this place. It took an hour and a half to get seated. But if you want to play a slot machine or you are a smoker, this is where you can kill time by doing both while you are waiting.  Even though there was a long wait, it was worth it. I ordered a half dozen oysters and it was fresh and had a sweet taste to it. For entree, I had a combo pan roast seafood. The texture and flavor was delicious.   The chef, Bob, and the waitress made the whole experience well worth it as they are the only two people working during that shift. They cracked jokes as they made you feel like you are at home dining.",

    "text": "We tried the combo pan roast (spiciness level: 5), Alaskan chowder (New England style) and the linguine and clams served with white sauce. The best thing is the combo pan roast. It is flavorful and almost worth the long wait. We waited more than an hour even coming here at 12:30 am on a Friday morning. They are definitely understaffed here, so you have to give credit to the one cook who is literally working nonstop even at 12:30 am in the morning and the one waiter/busser who has to clear the dishes, take orders, fill drinks and hand you the check. The one plus to this place is that it seems to be frequented by more of the locals/local gamblers, so you get a very different vibe here, compared to going to a restaurant on the strip.  Primarily, the major difference between the different seafood offerings here is the sauce that accompanies the dish. The sauce is already cooked and put in near the end. The seafood is cooked in steam powered kettles with some seasoning. Once the seafood is nearly done, the appropriate sauce is then ladled into the kettles. Once everything is done, the kettles are rotated so that contents can be transferred to a bowl. Water and some soap is used to clean the same kettle which is then used for the next order. If you are squeamish about seeing your food prepared and dishes washed (favoring the veil of ignorance), then this may not be the place for you.  If you are going to wait more than an hour, then you should get some sort of pan roast. Almost everyone orders the combo pan roast which is served with shrimp, crab and lobster. The sauce is what you are primarily after. It is a tasty creamy tomato based sauce (with a splash of brandy). The level of spiciness is determined by you from 1 to 10. We chose level 5, and it was not spicy at all. This sauce was seasoned well and good by itself, but it also did a good job of accompanying the seafood.  In comparison, the Alaskan chowder (also cooked similarly) was much less flavorful. The sauce used was a New England chowder style sauce, primarily made of cream. While the pan roast might have almost been worth the wait, this definitely was not worth the wait. There are better chowders elsewhere with much less required waiting. Our personal favorite is the New England clam chowder at The Original Fish Company in Los Alamitos, CA. I'm sure you have your own favorite elsewhere.  Finally, the linguine and clams with white sauce was nothing to write home about. There is linguine. There are clams. There is white sauce. That about sums it up. Yes, you could argue that we should not have ordered this coming to this place, and you would be right. So who is arguing? Skip this dish, as you have also had it much better elsewhere.   Come for one thing here, the pan roast. If you are dead set on coming here, try to find out when the off hours are. It definitely was not at 12:30 am on Friday morning in the middle of winter, so I am not sure when the off hours might be. Good luck to you.",

Want to jump on the latest fad that is sweeping across all of your Asian friends who go to Vegas and want to eat and then take 12939021389012839012 photos and post their food pics on Instagram? Well, friends then never fear... OYSTER BAR IS HERE!   Location: Inside the Palace Station hotel. It's not as far as Bachi Burger and relatively cheap and inexpensive if you decide to split a cab.   Wait: Let's just say they don't have a fast pass... The most frustrating thing about this place is the wait. However, I'm gonna break it down for you so you know the best and worst times to go... I highly recommend going at odd hrs. (1-3am post clubbing is not an odd hr in Vegas).... AS in you will be waiting for a few hrs at that time. Trust me. The best time to go for Pan roast is about 9:30am. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for a long ass time....   Seating: Frustrating. They seat you based on available party. If you plan on coming with 10 people to this place forget it. You will never be seated together. I highly recommend not coming with more than 4 people in one party. Essentially, you sit whenever there is a free seat and their seating arrangement is about max 12-15.   Service: Top notch. Waitress and staff are super gregarious and nice.  Food:   Pan Roast: LEGIT.   Spice: You can adjust the spiciness of the Pan roast, however, I recommend not getting anything over a 5-6.. In terms of our waitress, she said \"7\" and you're dying... I ate with a Korean and a Vietnamese and they were having a hard time. You don't want something to be so spicy you can't enjoy it. 5 had just enough spice and still made it enjoyable.   *While I enjoyed the pan roast and got lucky with the wait, I still feel that Ritter's in the OC's pan roast was better. I'm a sucker for creaminess in my soup and I felt that Ritter's nailed it right on the head. Regardless, this place is amazing however if you have to wait more than 20 mins (Chances are you will) I'd recommend just going to Ritters in the OC. It's almost identical!   Cheers,   J to the Y.",

If you can't handle a lot of spice, I would suggest you get 5 or lower. They cook everything right in front of you which is pretty cool. My bf got the panroast which is the most popular. Although it was good, I enjoyed my gumbo more.   Second time I decided to get the jambalaya which was also appetizing. Stepped down my spice from 7 to 5.

Took me and my party of 3 about an hour to be seated; there were only 6 people in line ahead of us, but it was totally worth it. I've been to Vegas 3 times this summer knowing about this place, but it wasn't until the 3rd time out that I was sober enough to make my merry drunk way from the strip to the Palace Station. The Pan Roast (crab, shrimp, and lobster) was highly recommended so that's what I ordered and it was great. They make everything in front of you so that's cool. I forget what my friends ordered, but it was also very good. Great hangover food.",

I had the Palace Pan Roast which was delicious. Creamy and hearty, the bowl came with nice chunks of seafood, crab, shrimp and sausage which really hit the spot. The base of the stew is a just the right combination of tomato and cream, not too much of either. Careful on the level of spiciness though, I ordered 7 on a scale from 1-10, and even that overpowered a lot of flavor.  Don't bother with the caesar salad, it came overdressed; although, it had nice, fat shrimp too.  I did come in once past midnight on a weekday, and was able to take a seat immediately. I had the linguine alla Vongole, which was a lightly flavored pasta with clams. A good pick if you don't want something too seafoody. When it wasn't busy, I found folks working behind the bar polite and attentive.",

If you are a seafood lover, you must order this.  I ordered the Pan Roast at level 8, and it has a kick to it, it was not overwhelming at all.   I also ordered a dozen of Oysters on the half shell.  So yummy! Yes there is a long wait, but come on good seafood! good beer and friendly service.  I was fortunate enough to dine during the hours that both Sandra and Ricardo work.  Sandra is the waitress/server where she takes order, she's friendly fast, and accurate.  Ricardo is the chef that makes yummy food.  OMG! he was so nice and friendly and even shook my hand to greet me.  He also did some modification to my pan roast where it took the pan roast yumminess to another level:EPIC.  He added more lobsters and clams.  Sea food lover gone to heaven right? OH gosh!     Btw-if you want to avoid the long wait, come at 1 or 2 am when you are drunk. :) good food. definitely coming back!",

There was an obnoxious couple sitting next to my husband complaining (literally yelling at the staff).  They made it very uncomfortable especially since we didn't see what their problem was and it sounded personal.  They ordered that the food be re-done for all 4 people in their party because none of them should have to eat alone as he stated so loudly before he stormed off to get the Managers.  One was named Cedric I didn't catch the other managers name. Feeling bad for the chef we started talking to him and commended him for his reaction to the customer.  It turns out he's coming to Hawaii next year and wants to eat fresh fruit and things the locals eat so we gave him our phone number and told him to give  us a call-we'll give him mangos that can't be bought at the stores!   The food was great as usual!  I ordered 3 oyster shooters and my husband and son's gf offered to help me so I had to order 3 more!  :)  They were clean, fresh, no shells-just how I love it!  Our pan Roasts and chowder was so good!  We even bought a gumbo to go for a midnight snack that my son and I had to force ourselves to eat later that night.  LOL  Everything there is great.  We return every chance we get and recommend this place to everyone even if the line is long.  It can be a 1 1/2 hr wait so don't go when you're hungry, go before you get hungry.  ;)",

I found the Oyster Bar via an Internet search and based on the Yelp reviews, I coaxed my fiance into going. Entering the Palace Station, I was a little skeeved out. It smells and the people are a bit of a motley crew. I said 'we are eating and promptly leaving'. We approached the line to wait for chair at the Oyster Bar and waited about 45 minutes to be seated. After reading the menu online, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted - the Pan Roast. We were starving and ordered the Calamari. My fiance and I chose different Pan Roasts. He ordered the Palace Roast and I the Combo Roast. We sat, happily eating our very tasty Calamari, amused watching oysters being shucked and each Pan Roast being made in the steam pots in front of us. The crowd at the bar was fun, we chatted with those to the left and right of us. The service was attentive and the chef was quite funny as he worked. Finally... two huge bowls were placed in front of us. A bright red, hot bowl of the most fantastic garlicky smell I've encountered. It's like a soup, it's like a bowl of seafood goodness, it is unlike anything I've tried and it was heavenly. Just plain heavenly. It was such a awesome meal. Go to the Palace Station and find the Oyster Bar! I hope your experience was as good as ours because we are huge fans and definitely will be back.",

    "text": "Oh my god. Arguably, my most FAVORITE dish in all of Vegas:  the Pan Roast  This little gem is located inside Palace Station. My girlfriend and I came here since she is obsessed with oysters. We searched for \"oysters\" on yelp and sure enough, this took the #1 spot.  Sure their oysters were great and just about as yummy as you'd think and the clam chowder was to-die-for, but enough of that. Let's get to the COMBO PAN ROAST!  This dish is a seafood bouilliabase full of magic and deliciousness you can't find anywhere else. They cook it in specialized steam pots with the freshest seafood you can find in Vegas. We make it a point to come here at least a million times during every visit. (ok maybe 2 or 3, but you get the idea)  You know what? I'd probably make the 3-4 hour drive from LA just for this baby. Seriously. It's that good. You haven't tasted Vegas until you've tried Palace Station's Combo Pan Roast. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Go get it. It'll become your new favorite. I promise.  *EDIT: My friend Angelie D. told me that one of the chefs actually left to open his own restaurant in Chino Hills, CA called \"The Boiler\" ...all the same stuff, including the pan roast :D HELL YES",

    "text": "SO DELICIOUS WORTH THE WAIT!!!  So don't be alarmed when you show up and you see only 10 spots and they are all full and there's a line through the casino.  It is totally normal.  It is also totally normal to stand and wait for 90 minutes.    Such a unique experience. They cook everything right in front of you. You are greeted with a fresh hot loaf of sourdough bread as you wait for your entrees.    Start off with some fresh raw oysters - their cocktail sauce is really good.  Also if you are into it - you can get 3 oyster shooters for $10.   Their most popular items include the Cioppino - tomato stew with clams, mussels, shrimp and crab.  My favorite was the Combo Roast - Shrimp, Crab, and Lobster sauteed with Brandy, Cream and Tomato!!!  So delish - i licked up every last bite!  Portions are BIG so it is enough to share between two people. If you ask to split they will give each person their own scoop of rice as well. Small splitting fee involved.   Great customer service and it is very entertaining to watch them prepare right in front.  Would come back even with the same wait. Still giving this place 5 stars!  TIP: About a $20 cab ride from the strip.",

My husband the Oyster bar on his guy trip the week before we went together and he kept raving about this combo \"pan roast\" so this was the 1st thing I had to try at 10:30 AM on a Friday since seating is very limited and the lines can get LONG but it's open 24 HRS!    I ordered 1/2 dozen oysters which were very fresh and yummy.  My husband and I split the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab.  The split is you get 2 separate bowls of rice with the pan roast (a thick stew like jambalaya with more soup that comes in a large bowl). One order is plenty for 2 ppl to share.We ordered it a level 7 out of 10 on the spicy level and it was still hot but bearable.  We are definitely going back to the Oyster bar to eat it again! ^^",

The combo pan roast was luscious and rich... very good.  Crab and lobster were sweet, buttery and fresh... excellent... the shrimp was kinda like filler in the combo... but the star of the dish is the creamy broth.  I easily could have stopped halfway through as it's pretty filling, but there's no way I could resist that broth.   Excellent food... not sure if I'd wait in the typically long lines, but if you happen upon an opportunity, take it.",

We always grab beers from the bar across, to make the wait easier.   We had a dozen of oysters & clams each, New England clam chowder, gumbo with crab meats, and cioppino.  The oysters are the big ones, it tastes creamy and briny.  The clams were so fatty & succulent, fresh & sweet.  I never see clams so huge!!   New England clam chowder is my fav, chucks of clam meat & seafood, creamy but yet not too thick, just the right amount of potatoes. It was so east to lick the bowl!   The gumbo & cioppino were both on salty side, we couldnt even finish it because it was way too salty, even it came with a scoop of rice, however it wont balance out the saltiness.  We ended up packed it to go, it tasted really good on the next day with a gallon of rice.  lol  Never like their oyster shooters, made me gagged.",

It still took forever because someone had ordered like 10 dishes to-go! After they finished the to go orders, they switched cooks and mannnn this new guy, Ricardo, was on it! He seriously moved as fast as humanly possible and was funny too! He even gave us free oysters because he overheard us contemplating if we should get some. He jokingly said \"don't do it,\" because it'd be more work for him, but he shucked us some anyways! The oysters were fresh, fat and juicy! The service made my meal. I would've just been like yeah, this is pretty good, but man, the new cook pumped up my mood and made me actually happy to be there and made it much more worth it IMO.   We got the combo pan roast ($24), which comes with lobster, crab and shrimp in a creamy tomato stew. They are not stingy with the seafood! Wow! And the pan roast is soo rich and comforting. I got a level 6 spice but barely felt the heat. The portion is also huge! It fed the bf and I for 2 meals each.   Yes, the prices are a little steep and they charge for splitting plates ($5) but the food is pretty damn good.   The wait takes for frikken ever because it's literally just a bar and it only seats around 18. (You also have to be 21+ to eat here!) Come at an off time to minimize your wait :P",

    "text": "Came here a few times and it's about time I write about it! Each time I have gone the line has been long. The best time to go, so I have heard, is 3am-7am. I once came here at like 8am and waited 30 minutes, another time came after 8:30am and waited like two hours. This time I  went around 9:30pm at night. The line was not moving at all...   When we got closer to the front... 2.5 hours later... we realize it was because the chef was going slow. I don't want to be mean, but he was literally moving slow, prepping the food slow, washing the pots slow. It explains why the line was hardly moving. He had two servers helping him. It didnt help that the order before us was a to go order and it was like 12 dishes. I thought you could only order one or two per person but I guess not. When we finally sat down it was like 12. At this time a new chef, Ricardo (I believe, was starting and helped finish up the to go order. A new server also started at the same time, Bob. If it wasn't for Bob and Ricardo, I think it would have not been worth the wait. Bob and Ricardo were entertaining, funny, and easy to talk to. We were the first one who ordered but had to wait because of the to go orders.   We sat next to the oysters and made small talk with the chef about how big they were and how juicy they look. We instantly regret not getting any oysters to start. The chef laughed at us and was surprised we waited this long and not get any oysters. I guess he noticed our disappointment because before we knew it, he shucked out 5 big oysters (since we were a party of 5) for us. It was a kind gesture that made all of us remembered and want to come back.   My boyfriend and I ordered the Combo Pan Roast. MUST GET!!!!!!! So delicious! I got a level 4 and it was good, my boyfriend who eats spicier got a 6. I can't even begin to describe the food other than omg. So rich and creamy, and they don't skimp you on the lobster or crab meat. Had to order extra rice because it was so good. They charge you $3.99 for an extra scoop of rice.   Got my bill and realize that they did not charge the people I went with for splitting a dish. I read some yelp reviews that they charge you for splitting. I also ordered two bowls of rice to-go to eat with my left overs and they didn't charge for that or the extra bread! Bob and Ricardo seriously made our night because before that, we were feeling pretty crappy about it - having to wait almost 3 hours in line. It sucks because you cannot even leave the line. All have to take turns.   Long story short, I highly recommend trying this place (actually don't, you'll make the line even longer hahaha). Just be prepare to wait!",

My advice is go during off ours so you can just sit down and enjoy some good ole Creole fare. The gumbo at spicy level 8 was superb! I got the house version which was loaded with shrimp, sausage, lobster, and crab!  My wife had the Pan roast with shrimp and it was super creamy with the perfect balance of a light reux as a base. There is a oyster bar in the sunset casino, but it is nowhere near the quality of this one. This you must try if your in Vegas for vacation or a local looking to spice up dinner! Also the portions are large so you will probably get two meals out of one bowl, unless your a glut like me! :)",

All I kept telling myself while we waited for almost two hours in line was this place better top Ritters in Huntington Beach.  Two hours you say?  Yup.  I was prepared for it arriving at 8pm on a Saturday night.   So bae and I  took turns hitting the slots and sipping on our Cab and Merlot.  Forgot if we did two or three rounds.   So time definitely went by fairly quickly but my tummy was sure hongry once we got seated.  We ordered-  House pan roast.  Level 3. They ran out of  lobster so we doubled on the crab.   All good because this creamy tomato made in heaven was the BOMB! Omg! You need to see our bowl, before and after shot.  The wait was definitely worth it but next time if there is a line,  we will just return in a later time.  Linguini and clams in white wine Level 3 was uhmazing.  Aldente and lots and lots of clams! Fresh and savory made my tummy satisfied!!!  Then we had special ordered the large clams in garlic herb.  Eze was not thrilled to make this treacherous dish because it takes forever but oh man...this was awesome AF! So juicy and packed with flavors we barely took a breath eating it!!!  And fyi Eze,  I will order this again on my return!  Hahaha   He was super sweet tho and I made sure I gave him a nice cute wink on our way out.  #thankful#always #MY#misshimalready",

Butttt. there is always a wait and always a few people who take their sweet time eating and chitchatting away when there are people waiting at 4AM. Come on have the decency to eat and leave! Especially when there is limited seating.  Anyway, the Combo Pan Roast with a spice level of 7/10 is the way to go. Has big chunks of seafood... omg salivating as I'm writing this. Very hearty and creamy. Perfect after a long night of drinking and clubbing.  On the other hand, my experience with their raw oysters was a miss. They weren't fresh... stick to the pan roast.  A must try! This is honestly the best part about Vegas and there are many places where they try to copy this place but they are no match to the ORIGINAL OYSTER BAR at fhe Palace Station Hotel!!!!!  Next time I want to try the Boulla-roast dish! The mix of the Boullabaise and the Pan Roast!!",

We got to sit close enough to see the cook prepare the meals, everything was prepackaged like lobster, shrimp, crab etc. for the Bouillabaisse. Wife ordered the combo pan roast. We were starving so devoured the rolls, wife wanted more. We did take out and there were 4 more rolls included. The pan roast was devoured by the wife and then she wanted some of my Bouillabaisse. The cups of rice were perfect to go with the order. A spoon full of rice dipped into the Bouillabaisse ended up covered with sea food. The lobster was so big I had to cut it as it was HOT and much easier to put into my mouth in a smaller size. I don't normally eat this much rice but I finished it completely and still had Bouillabaisse left over. Had a chilled bottle of Moscato in the hotel room, perfect with the pan roast and Bouillabaisse.  Palace Station Oyster Bar is the best in Las Vegas. I would give it a 9 out of 10 as there must be a Gordon Ramsay or Emeril restaurant out there with better and much more expensive Bouillabaisse. But only $25.99 is GREAT priced.",

They are notorious for their long wait times because there are only 18 counter seats.  I finally got a chance to dine here with 2 of my 3 sisters and our mom!  We were lucky and got there at an off time between lunch and dinner.  It took about 30 minutes to get a seat for the four of us on a Monday afternoon.   It's very entertaining to watch the chef prepare all of the meals!  I was so happy to go with a group because I got to taste all of their dishes!  My baby sister got the Pan Roast (crab version) which everyone talks about.  We both thought that it was okay.  Mom got the chiopinno; and my other sister got the clam chowder - I liked that the best! I got the steamed clams and half dozen fresh oysters...nom nom!  People question the quality of seafood at a restaurant in the middle of the desert... In my opinion, everything was fine. I appreciated the complimentary bread and butter. .. I was starving as usual!  Hahaha!   I would return if someone wanted to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way.  I'm happy to complete another bookmark and look forward to visiting one of the other Oyster Bar locations.",

    "text": "My friend recommended that I give this place a try the next time I went to Las Vegas so I decided to try it.  I had a car so I drove there. This place is not on the Strip so if you want to try it, you will either need a car or you will need some means of transportation to get there (Uber, taxi, or maybe public bus service). Using my GPS, the place was easy to find and parking was plentiful and free.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I went there but saw a line to get seated. The place is a bar top with roughly 20 seats around the bar. I waited in line and it took me ~2 hours to finally be seated. There was a family of 4 in front of me and because I was solo, I was seated before them so they waited even longer than I did to be seated. I went there on a Friday evening at roughly 9pm and I wasn't seated until around 11pm.  The person sitting next to me was having half a dozen oysters in a half shell so I asked him if it was any good and he asked me if it was the first time I was there which I said yes and he told me that it was great and whenever he comes in from LA, he always comes to this place at least once. I ordered the half dozen oysters in a half shell and they were great. They were very fresh without any weird/strange odour/taste. Along with the oysters, I had glass of beer and the combo (crab, shrimp, and lobster) pan roast. They ask you for how spicy you want the pan roast on a scale of 1 to 10. Based on some of the reviews I read, I opted for 2 which I found to be spicy. If it was not spicy enough for me, they had plenty of spicy condiments that I could add after.  The oysters were great. The pan roast was great. The beer was good. The only thing that I wasn't thrilled about was the 2 hour wait to get seated (you are generally standing while you wait since casino security generally won't let you sit down at the casino machines unless you're playing).  The fewer people you go with the faster you will be seated. Even though a family of 4 had been waiting ~10 minutes before I lined up, I was seated before them and it wasn't until I was almost finished my meal around 30 minutes after being seated that they were finally seated (so they probably waited between 2 hours thirty minutes and 3 hours to be seated).",

My family stopped by Vegas on our way home from Grand Canyon/Antelope Canyon/Horseshoe Bend. We put the kids down at 930pm, and I made my way over to the Palace Station. I waited in line for an hour, and then another 45 minutes after I was seated. I watched the chef masterfully make each Pan Roast to order. By midnight, my wife and I were thoroughly enjoying our Combo Pan Roast and Clam Chowder in the hotel room while the kids slept. And boy, was it delicious. Just the right amount of creaminess, spiciness, and assorted seafood. This definitely lived up to the hype.  The clam chowder was excellent in its own right, and soothed some of the heat from the Pan Roast. These two complemented each other well, but if you're only going to get one thing from The Oyster Bar, it would obviously have to be the Pan Roast.  Whether you eat there or get it to go, just wait in line. It's worth it.",

    "text": "2-star experience: Friday, 2pm , 10 people in front of my party of 2.  1hr wait for seats to 17 chair bar 12ft from slot machines. Really not a restaurant, located on the casino floor next to players club. Advice not to have a party more than 4. Really just one cook, 1 waitress, 6 pot cookers so for 17 people even seated there will be a 20 min wait until chow time. No menu during wait. Waiting is in the middle of the casino floor on the carpet. Advise to not be fooled with a short line of 8 people. It will be an hour wait. !!!  Biggest advice   Pan combo was excellent 5-star and the boullibaise tasty, good sauce and flavorful. Salad was large portion and so were the dishes. Would return but really need to carve out 2 hours of your day.   Pluses are they are open 24 hours but does not slow down until 3am. No real specials except 1am-7am $10 oysters and beer  Harrahs oyster bar is a real restaurant , ample space, nice decor and good wait staff.  It's up to the cook who doubles as server to provide good company and service. Palace station would score higher than my favorite Harrahs but the pathetic wait, lack of service (borderline I am too busy) would turn me away 65% of the time if  I craved good seafood. The lack of service is limit by the small seating options and cooking area.  All shifts they only have one cook and best 2 waitresses .    Kids under 21 not allowed at bar reads sign.",

    "text": "Is it a bar with oysters? Say whaaaa?!? *confuzzled*  I didn't understand the concept at first, but my boyfriend swore to me that the Southern Cajun dishes at this establishment are superior in quality and taste. I was sold because one of my favorite cuisines is Southern. Think bold, spicy flavors :P I'm also always open in trying new restaurants that specialize in Cajun dishes.  When we arrived, the \"bar\" was nestled comfortably on the left of the casino. There were a few patrons in line, who didn't seem irritated or flabbergasted at the long wait, even though, I'm quite sure they waited for at least an hour or possibly, even longer. I think the  booze and cigarettes helped their moods :) I should've known this! :P  TIP: This is not a sit-down restaurant where there's a waitress taking down names; it's much more informal -- when there's an empty chair or a chair opens up, the next patron waiting in line takes it. You wait in line until you're next up AND there are enough seats to accommodate your party. So keep in mind-- keep your parties small so that the line can easily keep on moving or you're left waiting for a LONG time (expect 2+ hours) if you have a bigger party.  My boyfriend and I were fortunate that we stood in line with very friendly, cheery, funny, and obnoxious (in a positive way:) patrons that confided in us about the food and their experiences at the bar. It kept us company for a good 45 minutes. After many laughs and loud giggles, two chairs finally opened up for us! I felt like I won the lottery! :) I was that giddy.  We both ordered the combo pan roast and received our orders in 30 minutes? I don't remember the exact wait time for the food because I was chatting it up with the patron next to me and my boyfriend :) Anyway, the chefs make the food in front of you, and sometimes, or maybe because I'm easily entertained, it's quite amusing to watch them. This helps the clock tick a bit faster.   The pan roast with a small scoop of rice was absolutely perfect. Just everything -- its spices, the abundance of seafood in the bowl, and its portion, I felt like it was an experience that I didn't want to end. The food was on point that night. Next time (and my boyfriend promises me that there will be a next time), we will order oysters as the starter and share a combo pan roast. I was so full after the pan roast.  I can't wait to relive this experience... but with drinks of course :)",

    "text": "With tons of modern casinos and hotels on the strip, there's really no reason to venture to palace station. But within this outdated casino is a wonderfully delightful seafood \"bar\", conveniently called oyster bar.  I was told about this quaint little location by my best friend before my recent trip vegas and was even warned about the long lines and waiting time. But I will say this get there as early as possible because the waiting time can be ridiculous. Here's an example, I went on a Monday night at 1AM in the morning and wasn't seated till 2:45AM. Yes for a Monday night that's insane but so worth the wait. The yelp reviews alone gives you a taste of what to expect.  So when my wife and I finally got seated we shared a dozen oysters. They shucked the oysters in front of our eyes and I must say they were fresh and delicious. With just the right amount of horse radish, and hot sauce made it a perfect appetizers. We then order what's clearly the most popular dish, the pan roast. It's a combination of seafood and what appears to be a very tomato bisque type soup, with a definite taste of Parmesan cheese. It's served with a scoop of rice. The presentation reminded me of gumbo. The process alone to make this tasty dish is worth watching. The chef entertains you while cooking multiple dishes in what seems to be a roasting/ stemming pot.   With seating for about 10-12 people there will always be a wait but the staff are pleasant and entertaining. They make you feel at home but definitely don't take shortcuts with their food. Since it's off the strip it's a place you will have to make a detour too but I'm telling g you it's worth it. Despite being in a smoky and outdated hotel, the oyster bar is clearly the shinning jewel of this location. I guarantee I will always make a personal stop there everytime I'm in Vegas.",

Don't waste any time on the raw oysters (not cleaned very well and you can find better places elsewhere in Vegas)  Stick with what they're famous for:  PAN ROAST  My favorite: combo pan roast  My husband's favorite: palace pan roast   I prefer tasting the lobster, crab, etc; however, my husband loves meat and he likes the hearty flavor of the palace pan roast. It has a distinct taste of the sausage that emanates. For me, I think the sausage taste is overwhelming and Noneifies the lobster and crab taste I'm looking for.  It's personal preference, but either way, you can't go wrong if you order the pan roast.",

I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here at midnight because I love it so much. Of course I celebrated with a beer and some oyster shooters. Crazy I know...  The Oyster Bar is now open 24 hours which makes it so easy to try and a great place to go to when I get off of work at 5am. There usually is always a line since there is seating for only 15-18 people...but that doesn't deter people from waiting...their food is THAT GOOD. The chefs are usually always talking to the guests as he's cooking which makes the experience fun.",

They are strict on seating if you told them you need seats for 2 and at  the last minute you tell them another number, they'll only give you what you told them the first time around.  The food: delicious ! Maybe because I was waiting in line for almost 3 damn hours and iwas just exhausted . My TIP would be to order Rice on the side because when they give your bowl of whatever you ordered (pan roast, jambalaya etc.) they put the rice right on top. Food was so good, But Nobody should wait 3 HOURS, just to eat a meal.",

They have a 13 chairs and the average meal per person is about a 55 min experience! Service not as great as the food!! Such a shame really! Palace station needs to do the right thing and customize this place to please the public that keeps them in business.",

Took us a bit of walking to actually find it amongst the gamblers and machines but once there you can't miss it.  Oysters were fresh, delicious and HUGE. Shrimp cocktail is a classic must. The soups you CANNOT miss out - we got the Alaskan chowder \"dirty style\" which is a half and half.  You get to choose the level of spice - we got a level 6 which was PERFECT. All in all best food we had our entire stay in Vegas.",

    "text": "Definitely WORTH the wait.   These oysters are HUGE, probably the biggest that I've ever had at a restaurant. The oysters were super fresh, very sweet and didn't taste or smell fishy.   On to the pan roast. The combo (shrimp, crab, and lobster) was so delicious! I would recommend getting rice on the side instead of in your pan roast because the portions are huge. You can definitely share it among 2 people and still be full (but they do charge you to split). It's probably better if you don't split though, because you'll definitely want a to go box to eat more later!",

The creamy tomato base with seafood is what I describe as heaven.    Although there is usually a wait if 1 -1.5 hrs...but it still worth it!  Highly recommend this place!!

    "text": "Oyster Bar in Palace Station is legendary for a reason. Just eat here. The pan roast is still every bit as sensational as the last review I wrote, and the combo pan roast with lobster will always be the stuff that your dreams and happiest memories are made of.   However, this time my review is to emotionally prepare you for your experience. I like to show up to Oyster Bar when I'm alone; Americans always have the need to space themselves out from strangers, and more often than not there's an empty solo seat. =Cue my entrance, please=  Here's what to bring if you show up during summer season or anytime (roughly) before 4AM or after 10AM: - Camping chair - A roadie (maybe you can flag a cocktail waitress down) - A few activities like crossword or Sudoku books (or coloring books, but no one under 21 here) - A ton of money to beg everyone else in front of you to let you cut in line  Great, now that we've established that the wait here is rough sometimes, you've finally made it to the front of the line and are about to pounce on the seats that just opened up. Staff will- with restraint- ask you to wait until the area is cleaned off. So hang out by the rope and just wait to be called.   I knocked this place down in stars because I'm tired of putting up with the staff's bullshit here. In the past 1,000 reviews, I've only commented negatively about staff one other time (The Mule in OKC), given that I'm a bartender myself.   The past two times here, the older servers have treated me like a burden and made zero effort to be pleasant at all; no thank you, no smile, no response except an order call back and a refill dumped on the counter. The whole thing straight up makes you feel BAD, and who the hell goes somewhere to eat and leave feeling like that? (If you didn't think it was possible to toss a drink at someone... it's possible.)   To the staff, if you're worn down from the tourist grind, get out of it and make room for someone who wants to be there, especially since money isn't ugly here.   Will it stop me from coming back? Nope. The food is amazing. And I still tip well because the cook ends up being nicer than the server, and the cook is part of the tip pool.   Maybe next time being a little nice to people will be on their menu, too. Or maybe not. Whatever. Pan roast and ignore.",

Both times ordered the Combo pan roast and both times so delicious! Ordered level 5 spice but did notice the second time it was a bit spicier. The combo pan roast is so creamy and so flavorful and pairs perfect with a scoop of white rice. Hubby ordered the gumbo which was delicious too! And half dozen fresh oysters! Only downside is that it's literally bar style with 17 seats! They really need to expand so wait times aren't so harsh but all in all one of my favorite places in Vegas!",

I have been fortunate to experience my fair share of wonderfully delicious, fresh seafood. Then came my visit and experience at the Oyster Bar and to think, I thought I would never love another. Fresh seafood in the desert? Especially at this small area which is truly a bar and located in the Palace Station Casino! First off I was expecting a actually restaurant. Instead we walked up and discovered that there was only limited seating and a line of people in front of us. We arrived around 6ish on a Friday evening. Neither did we know we actually picked a good time. Because, by the time we left after our wonderful meal, the line was 4 x longer. Now for all you stone cold seafood fans. Yes! It's worth the wait. That's a sure sign of how good the food is. Our wait was at least a hour and a half.  Now to our meal. My wife ordered the shrimp pan fry all of the stews come with a side of rice. I ordered the Cioppino, excellent! The experience in itself is overwhelming. Why? Because not only are you eating and tasting all of the ingredients of the delicious seafood.  You are seeing other dishes being made right before you! So it's a orgy of you tasting and watching the fresh seafood prepared right in front of you. Staff and service is outstanding! I would say that the Oyster Bar is exquisite. Because the food and the atmosphere is extremely beautiful. However, because of the wait those of you who will visit for your first time. You have to understand that it's delicate. The food is worth having the patience to wait!",

Got their New England Chowder, Palace Pan Roast and Seafood Jambalaya. Everything was exceptionally good but I'd have to say the chowder was my favorite and probably the best I've ever had.   Service was really good and the waiter/waitress were very attentive too.  Tip: If you like your food with a kick, definitely up the spice level. I felt like it enhanced the flavors rather than took anything away.  They also give complimentary sourdough rolls that came out hot and fresh.   Also, portions are fairly large so sharing is caring.",

This spot is not a sit down restaurant.  There are about 15 or so seats in a bar setting.    It can be hectic pretty much throughout the day.  When we arrived there were only 2 people waiting in line.  So we thought it was going to be easy breezy.  It was a bad idea.  We hit the casino for about 30 minutes and came back.  By this time the lunch crowd all decided to swarm in.  We got seated within 45-50 minutes.    The chef cooks right in front of you.  It's interesting to see the magic happen in an open kitchen setting.  I didn't get try the Combo Pan Roast with the linguini noodles.  But I was able to try a dozen of the raw oysters.  Very fresh for Vegas standards.  I also had the little neck clams in garlic herb broth.  Flavorful and delicious!  It's a must try when visiting Vegas.  I will be back to try more entrees.  Be patient because the wait is bearable.  Then you'll get to enjoy the seafood.  Not to mention the friendly service even though it's busy.",

We passed by the Oyster Bar and it instantly reminded me of Europe sitting and eating on the streets. We had to stop in. We were treated by a kind host who had the menu immediately out for us. I saw all kinds of great seafood and we were all in! We sat on the outside which was great. We got to people watch while eating. It wasn't super busy so it was a nice average noise. Our waiter was great. He came to our table immediately and got our drink and appetizer order. I ordered a mojito! It was a little on the strong side but it was so tasteful!  Enjoyed it a lot. Our appetizer was the mozzarella sticks. We didn't want anything too heavy because we were about to splurge on dinner. These were so so good. Freshly baked and homemade marinara sauce. I've never had such a good mozzarella stick in my life. Now for our dinner choice, I had wanted the Mahi Mahi but it was all out (bummer) so my next best choice was Alaskan King Crabs. So glad I chose this. They are already cut down the middle for you. The garlic butter sauce makes it savory!   My husband ordered the surf and turf & he said it was the best he's had in so long. The only thing that could make this place better is some tropical music! The place is super romantic and I wil definitely be back",

If there is a line - I think it's well worth it if the wait is only an hour or less. Standing for more than an hour or two in line when you're very hungry is not worth it. The \"combo pan roast\" is a must order. I'd describe it as a creamy and rich tomato based soup packed with shrimp , lobster and crab. When choosing spice level (1-10) for your pan roast , if you can handle spicy then definitely go higher. Settled with a level \"5\" & tried my friend's level \"8\" and the spicier was so much better. It didn't take away any of the flavors of the pan roast either. Each pan roast comes with choice of rice or noodles so I tried both on the side - noodles were rather interesting and I actually enjoyed it more than the rice with my pan roast :) Can't go wrong with either. Free sourdough bread too. One pan roast is good enough for two people , we even had enough for leftovers. Also tried the shrimp cocktail & oysters and they were fresh and tasty.",

His food is always on point.  My friend and I usually order a Combo Pan Roast, Crab Pan Roast, Clams Chowder, and the shrimp cocktails.  They gave the right portion of rice for each dish.   The pan roast flavors for this place is creamy, perfect consistency, not tomatoey but rich in seafood tastes.   Definitely will come back because it worths the wait.",

We ordered the combo pan roast at level 5 which was a pretty good level if you cant handle spicy and a clam chowder. The portions were pretty big. You could really taste all the chunky lobster, whole shrimps and bits of crab meat. It had like a tomatoey taste to it. It was alright but for the wait I would not come back. Unless I'm drunk lol.",

We got an order of 12oz oysters, which with creamy and delicious and big. You get complimentary sourdough rolls while you wait for your food. My recommendation is the pan roasts. Any of them would be good,  but we got the combo and there was lots of lobster in it in big chunks. We got a level 7 in heat and it was perfectly spiced and seasoned for us. Rich, creamy and satisfying. It comes with a side of steamed rice. I would definitely share a pan roast. We were able to finish a the whole pan roast with 2 people, i would have really struggled to eat that by myself. I really great find in Las Vegas!! I would definitely come back again. The staff is really friendly and they hustle to serve you.",

    "text": "Wow I waited in line for like 1.5 hours, and I can't wait to come back for more. Am I out of my mind? Yes, yes I am. Because I actually went back and waited 2.5 hours for a second time. Usually I feel like waiting in line for such a long time is stupid, but the excruciating wait makes the pan roast taste just that much better when you get it. Like the feeling you get when hard work pays off.   A boat load of spices and a mountain of seafood is doused in the tomato cream sauce to make the seafood pan roast. Loaded with big chunks of crab and lobster. This is one entree you MUST NOT divert from. You've already waited for such a long time, don't be a fool and not order the pan roast! It's the best pan roast I've ever had thus far.  Heard there wouldn't be as long of a wait if you come during odd hours; This statement is False. You can always potentially hit a rush of some sort of rush and wait 2 hours due to limited seating.  Last time I was here at 3 am. and there was a family that came before us, ended up waiting nearly 2.5 hours. Here's a tip, give yourself ample time to wait in line, wait for your food too cook, time to eat the food, and time to get the check. It's usually just a 3 people crew, and they gotta do everything. So don't come here in a rush. You can thank me later.",

It's hard to ration out stomach space while in Las Vegas.   The pan roasts were bomb. The portion size is very filling. Piping hot, creamy, and luscious with each spoonful filled with seafood. You can order it with a spice level from 1-10 and I found that anywhere from 5-7 to be the perfect amount of spice. We liked how we saw how it was cooked right in front of us at the counter.",

We absolutely loved our meal and my wife encouraged me to figure out how we can reproduce this awesome dish at home.  I tried to get the cook to give up the secret, however, he just kept saying, sit back in your chair and keep eating and enjoying it!  Shucks, no help here!  We even got extra rice to soak up all the beautiful and wonderful sauce that this dish provides.  I'm gonna remember this for a long time and hopefully try to create this at home.  Wish me luck!",

Yummy!!) -bouillabaisse (a little water down, but loved the seafood) -clam chowder (delicious!!! Nothing like those pour made canned clam chowder) -dozen oysters(delicious!!)  Total came out to $85 but definitely worth trying. Portions are HUGE so don't forget to share, share, share!  Service was fantastic! Ricardo entertained us and took care of my girls and I!

Ended up waiting about an hour and 45 minutes, the wait probably would've been a lot shorter, literally everyone in front of us had 4 or more people in their party, how unlucky of us :(. Anyways, we already knew what we wanted, so we ordered right when we got seated.  Oysters: I don't like oysters but my bf enjoyed it, I only like oysters from EMC because they're really small and doesn't really have that seafood-y smell.   New England clam chowder: I really wanted to order the alaskan chowder, but I ordered the new england one instead, it was really good! One of the best clam chowders I've ever had, there was a lot clams in it, which I loved. The soup was pretty filling for us already, we were half way full when we finished it.  Combo Pan Roast: We ordered level 8 spiciness, it was actually pretty spicy, will definitely get a 6 or 7 next time. I've had ritters before in Orange County, and it is pretty similar. The lobster and shrimp pieces were huge, they were not stingy at all with the seafood. The pan roast was really good and creamy, will definitely order this everytime I eat here.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Let me just get the negatives out of the way.  There is very minimal seating and turnover is very slow considering the meal comes out so quickly.  The wait is incredibly long.  During most times you will wait a good hour and a half; I came at 11:30pm on a Monday night (presumably a slow time) and still waited 30 minutes.  And finally, they do take out, but you have to have a seat at the bar to order which is incredibly poor judgement as they're missing out on plenty of sales to gain an even bigger customer base.  On to the good stuff now.  The food is incredibly tasty and the spice level is on point.  I ordered a 9 and it destroyed my stomach.  That's not a negative.  I love it when a restaurant lives up to their spice levels.  I ordered a combination pan roast and was served in about 10 minutes with a large bowl of awesomeness with a few chunks of lobster, crab, and shrimp (could have used more seafood but fresh nonetheless).  The service was great once seated.  Waiter comes around quickly to get your order and refills and fresh bread available upon request.  The main chef at the 24 hour spot even comes out and talks it up with the customers to ask how the meal is going.    Oyster Bar lives up to the hype in taste but I'm not sure if that's the greatness of the food or the psychological effect of waiting in line and eating.  Either way, it's worth a venture if you have time or are out and about at weird hours and are hankering for a great gumbo, chowder, pan raost, or other great seafood/Louisiana delicacies.",

    "text": "I went at 3 AM on a weekday so there wasn't much of a wait. All the seats were full and our group of 4 only waited about 5 min. I had high expectations seeing as how normal wait times can be up to 3-4 hours.   Pan Roast Combo: Very delicious! I would definitely get it again. I got a level 5 and my friend got a 7. However I think the dishes may have been switched (though she claims otherwise). You could taste the various flavors of the dish and the spices which blended together well into a bowl of pure deliciousness. It is possible to share one dish with two people with small/average appetites. I did find it weird and disappointing that they charge $4 for extra rice but it's Vegas so I suppose it is to be expected.   House Gumbo: I do not recommend this dish. The food was extremely salty! The dish was left untouched for the most part due to this. I've had Gumbo in various places and the best one was in New Orleans. This dish was just atrocious. No taste other than salt!   Raw Oysters: pretty normal/average. It tasted fresh and there are no complaints. I do find it amusing that the place is called Oyster bar but there aren't more oyster dish options such as cooked or fried Oysters but that is irrelevant.",

So delicious in fact that the wait was exponentially longer because of its popularity as the original location and limited amount of seats. 2 hours later I'm excited because everyone has been suffering as I have and it's finally our turn! We order a Caesar salad, pan roast, and gumbo.   Guys.  EVERYTHING IS JUST MEDIOCRE.   If flavor had a color, this would be beige. Crestfallen is a word I seldom get to use; that is exactly how I felt. Nothing spectacular, just blah. And what's the deal with the jasmine rice? It made me feel like I was at an Asian restaurant.  Also maybe to turn the seats and speed up the line, portion sizes could be decreased. Everyone looked like they were struggling at the end slipping in and out of food comas.   I guess this is one of those Vegas experiences...",

    "text": "I hate that despite the rave reviews on the seafood at Oyster Bar, the biggest talking point seems to be the hours-long wait. I've shown up many times, ready to eat, only to be frustrated by the long wait and leaving myself. Well, here's a local tip that I recently discovered. If you work night shifts like myself, go to the bar after work at 6 am, and you will be guaranteed a spot at the counter. I know it sounds extreme, but the pan roast is well worth it, even for breakfast.   If you haven't been here yet, the combo pan roast is the one to try if you love seafood. It has shrimp, crab, and lobster. If you're more of a surf and turf type of person, the house pan roast is more for you. For some reason, the scoop of rice is the perfect addition to this seafood stew. If you don't like it too spicy, don't get anything above 5. The highest level of 10 was actually tolerable in a good way, but you definitely won't be scarfing it down. Pass on the bread roll as the level of staleness is something that even the pan roast can't cover.  Other reasons to come during off hours include a half dozen oysters for $10 and $3 beer until 9 am. If you want to enjoy these benefits and no wait, you'll have to arrive before 8 am. By the time we finished our meal, there was already a line forming behind the velvet ropes.",

Big chunks of lobster, crab and shrimp awaits you in a perfectly crafted bowl of tastiness. They are generous in their portions and the same goes for their clam chowder too, which is scrumptious. I would skip on their oysters though, even though it is called the Oyster bar. They use a type of oyster called Gold band that is pasteurized and lacks flavor.   The wait is always long; be prepared to wait a while (we waited 2-3 hours each time we visited) but once you sit down and eat, it will be worth it!  A must try in Vegas!",

    "text": "Can't beat their dozen oysters for $20.  Pan roast is big enough to share with another person, which is what we did. Ask for extra bowl of rice since one scoop is not enough to go with their pan roast.  Best time to go is off hours.  We arrived at 10 am on sunday and there were 5 groups in front of us, which was a 30 minute wait, the shortest time i ever waited here. It's typically a 1-2 hour wait.  Only negative is that you'll be dining while the people waiting in line are staring straight at you, so you feel kind of rushed especially when there are 20 people in line maddogging you.  They're thinking hurry up and finish eating!  Just like what i was thinking while waiting in line.   Best advice is to tag team while waiting.  You hit the bj table while wifey waits in line, then come back in line while wifey hits the slots. Repeat one or two times!",

It's off the strips but soooo worth it. The food is so delicious!!!! It's made fresh right in front of you and you get to interact with the chef that is cooking your food. So it's a really cool experience!!! But let me tell you, this is like a bar style food place, they probably take about I wanna say 15 people at a time at the bar. So you wanna come early or have someone come wait in line cause it's about a 2 hour wait every time and the line is long. This place is super popular and it's open 24 hours. Which really surprise me because for a place that opens 24 hours the food is amazing!!! Their known for their pan roast which is what everyone orders and it does takes while for the pan roast to cook. So definitely order some appetizer while you wait for the main dish. The pan roast is like a creamy thick seafood( shrimps, lobster, crabs, bell pepper and sausage )stew sever with rice.   I highly recommend coming here if you're visiting Vegas or if you live here. Just writing this got my mouth all watery.",

    "text": "Will be visiting whenever I go to Vegas.  Combo pan roast, spice level 6: Creamy heavenly goodness. Mix in the rice, instead of eating it separately. Spice level 6 is perfect if you want a good kick. For those who can't take spice, 6 will be too much. For those who like fire and burn, 6 won't be enough. I went back and forth between eating the pan roast and bouillabaisse, and it was wonderful. If I had the pan roast by itself, I miiiiiight have felt it was too rich to finish the bowl - plus the portion is huge. Nevertheless, I will be having this dish whenever I go to Vegas.  Bouillabaisse, spice level 6: Flavorful is an understatement. It is a tomato based soup with huge pieces of seafood. It is truly a flavor explosion. I prefer the combo pan roast, but the two complement each other very well. Please see above for spice level review.   Oysters: Freakishly huge. Fresh. Loved.   The Oyster Bar is a small bar with only a handful of stools. We went Friday afternoon and waited about 2 hours. Tip: Do not go in large groups over 3 (2 is ideal). If 4 or more, please be mindful of others and break up into small groups, otherwise the seats will remain empty until the entire party can sit. You may not be able to survive the death stares and chatters of the other hungry patrons in line. Plus it's just rude.   Once again, THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR LARGE GROUPS.",

They have a \"moonlight special\" which is happy hour from 1am-9am. $3-beer $5-wine $10-1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell.   So we got there at 11:55pm on a Wednesday and of course all the seats were filled. Luckily we were second in line behind a group of two girls. There's only 20 seats available, bar style. It took about 10 minutes to get seated. We also came there on our last day..we woke up at 7am just to go before our flight at 10:45am. YES, it's that good! Luckily there was no line and a few open bar seats.  Everyone knows that after you wait for so long, once you reach the bar, you'll take your sweet time enjoying your meal. -another factor as to why it can be a reallllly long wait!   Good thing about this place is that IT IS located inside a casino (even though it's old and comparable to Reno casinos). If you have more than one person in your party, one person can stay in line while others get to gamble! :p   So far we've tried..  Combo Pan Roast $23.99 -very fresh shrimp! Comes with crab and lobster too, scoop of white rice.   Lobster Pan Roast $21.99 -my favorite, the lobster is so tender! Never had lobster so fresh. Comes with a scoop of white rice.   No joke, it smells AMAZING once you sit down at the bar. I smell fresh seafood and creamy goodness from the kettles of pan roast being cooked.   They give you a warm sourdough bread roll to snack on while you wait, along with a bowl full of butta! There's also a whole tray of different hot sauces to pick from.  You can choose your level of spiciness on a scale of 1-10. I've tried level 8 and 10. Both had a kick, but not too spicy. I think they only add more red pepper flakes. Add dashes of Tabasco into your pan roast, it makes it even more amazing!   It takes awhile for the cook to make the pan roasts..they come out fresh, boiling hot..which contributes to why it takes soo long for everyone to finish up too. You have to eat slowly otherwise you end up burning your mouth!  There's a $5 split fee for ordering one dish and sharing but my BF and I split a pan roast the last day we were there and they didn't charge us. The cook actually gave us an extra scoop of rice too. lol ..oh and you can order pan roast togo as well but it's limited to 2 orders per person.   I really love it there. Wish they had more seating so the wait would be shorter..",

Long, long, long lines but worth every minute because anything you order will be amazing.  Gumbo! Clear Salad! Pan Roast! ... to name a few of my favorite dishes.  We have eaten gumbo in many cities and the chef at Oyster Bar makes the best gumbo we've had thus far. [you're shocked at that statement, I'm sure but it's True] Many times we've stood in line and my husband didn't want to wait, but once we get to the counter he was so happy that we stayed. We are never disappointed. You absolutely forget how long you waited once you're in that seat and start watching them make the many delicious dishes they will be serving up. To kill time, we alternate gambling at nearby slot machines.   This restaurant is the first stop we make when we land in Las Vegas and YOU HAVE TO GO!  Dishes are priced at around $15.99 and up.",

Expect the 2-3 hr wait on a Saturday afternoon, for some very good Cajun seafood. I've never had etouffe, but I but it reminds me of gumbo--there's a very distinct file taste that I think I personally prefer less and less. But if that's your thing, by all means.   Don't let the name \"pan roast\" fool you, it's not a pot roast or anything. It's a tomato sauce, cream, and butter base stew. Comfort food. Be smart, take turns with your group standing in line so y'all can gamble and drink in between. There's only 20 chairs open, and 6 pots cooking at once, hence the long wait. The staff is super nice and accommodating, they called security on a super drunk guy who was invading our friend's personal space.   I agree with a previous reviewer, that a spiciness of 5/10 is enough kick, with still being able to taste your food.   I said 4 stars, only because our 2:45 wait was a big chunk of our weekend trip, to wait for this place. I could've settled for less. All in all, we're all leaving super stuffed and happy. Thank you Chef, Chrystina, and Mike, you all were great! Now to get our cute lil' bellies into our cute lil' Vegas dresses, lol...",

The creamy tomato base with tons of meats and seafood slays me every time! The Oyster bar is a must for my wife and I. Its a small place though, with only 18 bar like seats, you can easily wait over an hour to eat here. I've actually heard of hour long waits at 2am! It seems like the best times to go are at around 4-8am and... Well... That's really it... I've been here a lot and only once have I ever come and been able to be seated within 10mins(4am!)   If you've never eaten at a Base Bar before, you'll love this. At Base bars they make their soups/bases right in front of you, and serve you the Bases usually with a scoop of rice in the middle and just like the name implies, the Oyster bar actually has good oysters! I'd recommend them for sure.",

    "text": "Is it really worth all the effort? Do you really want to wait 2+ hours for some freaking expensive & slightly above average Cajun food?  No seriously, I would not recommend anyone to come here with an empty stomach at 12 AM because you will probably die from starvation while waiting in line. Okay it's an exaggeration but even tortoises move faster than this late night waiting line. Sure this Oyster Bar stay open 24/7, but the bar can only hold approximate 18 customers at a time. I left after 30 minutes of waiting because I figured that I will just come back here again in the morning. There's a \"Moonlight Specials\" from 1 AM to 9 AM and you pay $10 (reg $13.99) for 1/2 dozen of raw oysters.  zzzzz (sleeping time)  So after a good night sleep, I came back to Palace Station Casino at 9 AM and guess what - no line at all! Unfortunately, there was only one server taking everyone's orders and my food took more than 45 minutes to arrive. I noticed that almost everyone ordered pan roast and I was the only person ordered gumbo ...   ***  Cold Seafood Combination (shrimp cocktail, clams, oysters - $19.99): Good oysters, but I didn't like red oysters that much. High quality shrimps & cocktail sauce contained horseradish [3.75/5]   House Gumbo (creole soup made with a variety of seafood, okra, and andouille sausage served w/ steamed rice, shrimp + crab + lobster $23.99): I got level 5 spiciness level and it was just right. Good broth, but not worth the trouble & wait for 1+ hour. [3.75/5]  ***  3-star mainly due to lack of staff, long wait, and high price point. My recommendation?  1) Come here in the morning to avoid the dreadful waiting line. 2) Consider getting pan roast instead of gumbo.  P.S. - $5 fee if you want to share a plate   P.P.S. - There's another Oyster Bar at Harrah's Hotel and Casino, but it is not open 24/7.  P.P.P.S - Pike Place Chowder was ranked 80th on the Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat for 2016.",

Plus more broth and love. Color is all pinkish. Looks like Campbell tomato soup made with cream. I got white rice on the side. Add a couple boring but warm dinner rolls. The suggestion I have is to do better bread. Maybe San Francisco sourdough. Great for sopping up the soup.  Sure it's not cheap. But this soup is concocted in front of your eyes.  People all around me were eating raw oysters. Half dozen for $10 in morning. I'm not into raw oysters. But everything was great. I'll go back wherever I'm staying.",

My 2 girlfriends and I waited about an hour dying of starvation to eat here  as our first meal of the day at 3pm LOL but like everyone else has said, it was definitely WORTH THE WAIT. Here are the items we ordered and enjoyed:  Half shell oysters were really good and tasted even better with Tobasco, horseradish and pepper. Anything tasted really good at that point in our stomachs lol  The combination pan roast was thick and tasty with enough spiciness to carry out really good flavor over rice. The portions are huge here so I recommend sharing it among 2-3 hungry people.  The clam linguine in red sauce was also impressive too, which had a variety of spices to it. My friends and I also split this too.  The place is really small because they can only seat about 16 customers but goddamn, it is worth the wait and it's actually pretty cool to see how the chefs cook in front of you at the oyster bar with their turning and rotating kitchenware. The service was OK but regardless, I would wait an hour again :)",

We planned to come here later in the night because there is always a long wait (food is usually worth it) and we had a friend visiting from Japan so we wanted her to experience the great food without a super long wait. . But we still waited an hour and a half for a group of five only to be greeted with the worst human beings who hate their job/lives to be working that late. They stamped us all out to be drunk people when we sat down because we were all excited to sit down and enjoy some good food.  We were talking amongst ourselves on what to order and what everyone is getting and the server interrupts us and says she can't here her other customers (which we three drunk guys who sat themselves) because my Japanese friend is yelling gibberish.... (Japanese not gibberish and she was only talking to me who was sitting right next to her) they continue to ignore her and I have to order her food for her. Though-out the meal both two women servers give dirty looks to us and my Japanese friend. She felt so uncomfortable that I had to flag one of them down for the check which I was met with an eye roll from the neck tattooed waitress. Really regretting tipping them at all. Only reason I did was because we are all industry Vegas locals and I get we have bad days sometimes But the black waitress and the neck tattoo waitress has ruined palace station for me for good. Never going to this casino again.  Don't go when these two waitresses are working. Food is good but horrible service.",

    "text": "My friends and I went to town at this place.  We had to wait approximately 45 minutes due to the limited seating here (14 seats?) and due to arriving at a busy time.  There's only 1 chef and 1 helper at this place so don't expect your food to arrive like a fast food joint.  What's cool about the Oyster bar is that you can watch the chef add all the ingredients to the 6 cauldrons and 2 gigantic pots.  The 6 cauldrons are used to make the soup while 1 of the big pots is filled with fish stock and the other is for boiling the shellfish.  Here's what I ordered (all were excellent by the way):  * 1 dozen raw half-shell oysters: The chef schucked the oysters in front of us.  Looks easy when he does it.  I prefer squeezing the lemon and drizzle some cocktail sauce over them.  Taste great. * 1/2 dozen raw half-shell clams: Similar to the oysters but with a different texture.  I prefer the oysters though. * Palace Pan Roast: Combination of shrimp, lobster, crab, clams.  Tomato paste base with white rice.  Can feed 1 or 2 hungry souls.  Did I mention it's loaded with flavor. * Oyster Shooters with Vodka: With the cocktail sauce, you won't taste the alcohol or the sea-taste from the oyster.  Order 3 for a better deal.",

    "text": "I've made my way over to the Palace Station the last couple times I've been in Vegas to indulge at Oyster Bar. The combo pan roast is phenomenal and comes with a scoop of rice, which creates a perfect harmony with the roast. Think creamy seafood bisque. They ask you for a spice rating of 1-10 and I've gone with 4 as I like my roast on the milder side. There are only 18 seats at the bar, so I've heard that the wait can get pretty ridiculous (~2-3 hours), but if you head over at off meal times, it's not too bad (~30 mins). Again, I don't think the servers or cooks are rushing to get seats turned over, so that can add to the wait time. You can pay $5 (sharing fee) to split a pan roast with a friend if you don't think you can handle the serving portion.   Overall, a unique experience highlighted by the chefs preparing the pan roasts/gumbo in front of you at the bar.",

I went with two friends - one had the house pan roast, the other had the etouffee and I had the cioppino. We also split a dozen oysters, which were simply awesome! The entrees were perfectly seasoned, piping hot and just plain delicious! The portions are huge so we ended up taking plenty of left overs for the next day. Apparently their slowest time is around 9am, otherwise expect a wait. Honestly, I'll wait in that line every time I come to Vegas!",

We went on a Tuesday night, 7:30 PM. Parking was easy and free in the lot outside. There were only 4 people ahead of us in line. We waited about 45 minutes. Once seated, you wait another 30-45 minutes (because there are only 6 special cooking pan thing-a-ma-bobs). The pan roasts are what you need to try/order. The name is deceiving because I don't think they're really \"roasts\". They are more like stews. There is one cook who does it all and one guy who is the server (takes your order, serves drinks). The pan roasts are essentially garlic, butter, your protein (lobster, crab, shrimp, chicken) and a creamy, tomato soup/base. The smell is divine. You get rice on the side but you can also choose linguini noodles.   No Coke products....only Pepsi. Boo...",

I was a bit skeptical at first, and I really didn't expect much from this random little oyster hut in an off-strip casino... some friends recommended it, and raved about the pan roast, so I had to try it for myself. Now I'm the one recommending this place!  I was confused when we got there and weren't greeted or seated; I definitely stood there for about 5 minutes.  After that, my boyfriend and I just decided to go ahead and seat ourselves.  Whatta ya know?! It was like the invisible wall was broken down and we were now visible.  So I guess if there isn't a line and you see empty seats, help yourself!   I'm not a fan of seafood, so I ordered the chicken gumbo.  It was such a big bowl of gumbo! I definitely had leftovers.  I liked that it had a lot of chicken and okra and wasn't too salty.  I really enjoyed it.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp pan roast .  Omg.. Now, I said I wasn't one for seafood, but wow. This stuff tasted amazing! It definitely stole the show! I loved it with rice, but i found myself dipping my bread into it throughout the meal. For some reason, it reminded me of cheesy pasta sauce and it was glorious.   We've gone back and ordered the combo pan roast, but it was a bit of a seafood overload.  We read that the lines can get pretty long, so we went mid-afternoon (like we did the first time) and there wasn't much of a wait. There's also a fee for sharing! The portion easily feeds two people, though.  And you can ask for another dinner roll if you want to soak up every last drop of deliciousness!",

I have tried their raw oysters (nothing too special) and their Pan Roast. And wow the pan roast is so yum!! Its like a big plate of delicious sauce and meats paired with rice. It's big enough to share with my bf!   And the fun part about this place, you're  like sitting at a bar waiting for your food and u get to watch the chef make everyone's food in front of u! He's super friendly and talks to everyone while cooking away. Pretty cool place.   It's a bit pricey but I'm for sure coming back, definitely worth the stop and wait!  Can't wait to try their Gumbo and Clam Chowder next time!  Did I mention, this place is 24 hrs? Yup,u can come check out this place super late at night after partying it up in Vegas or come here super early while you're taking a gambling break or pretty much anytime u want!

TIP:go with a small group since there is only bar seating.  the staff was friendly, there was only 2 people working so service was real slow. we ordered dozen oysters, combo pan roast, and linguine with clams. the oysters were ok, i thought it would be really good since its named \"oyster bar\", linguine and clams was above average (you can't really go wrong with linguine clams). i think the best and most popular one was the combo pan roast, it was so tasty you have to try it.  the food took about 20 minutes to come out but we were entertained by them cooking in front of us, we ate all our food in about 30 minutes and then it took another 30 minutes for them to get our check and give us boxes for leftovers. this seems like a fast place to eat but it can take a while, when we left there was a line with a 45-60 min wait.  i give this place 4 stars because of the good food and friendly staff, minus 1 star for slow service and being at palace station casino (away from strip)",

It looks like a standard casino bar with people sitting at the counter.  Upon closer inspection you'll see the steam cookers cooking away directly behind the counter.  These steam cookers cook by steam, not by flame or heating element and they cook fast.  The seafood pan roast is excellent but beware what spice level you choose.    I've seen a level 5 (out of 10) prove to spicy for many spice lovers.  The oysters here are fresh and out of this world.  Not fishy and the perfect size, not too small and not too fat.  They are the sweetest oysters I've tasted anywhere.  I sometimes think there's a conspiracy where they put sugar on them.  If you're a seafood lover check this place out!

The oysters are fresh, sweet and quite meaty. The Jambalaya has a lot of seafood in it. I went with a 7 on spice... I will try a 5 next time. It was making me a bit teary eyed, but it was so good. As I was finishing my mean, I saw him cook a \"pan roast\", even though their portions are huge and I was stuffed. I got hungry again. Whatever they add on that pan roast smells so good. If you sit in the center seats of the bar, the food is being cooked no more then 4 feet in front of you. You will want to eat everything. I would highly recommend coming with several people, ordering several dishes and sharing them family style. There is a $5 split charge if you share a dish between two people... and the dishes are large enough to share between two people. If you order oysters, they seem to wave the split charge... so it may just be one dish per person to avoid the split charge... in any case. You get to see the chef cook your meal right in front of you.",

Just imagine the bowls they use for an xtra large bowl of Vietnamese noodles, Pho, filled to the rim with mouth watering gumbo.   Be warned, the oyster bar only seats about 15 at a time.

    "text": "The wife mentioned that she wanted to have some gumbo, so I googled, \"best gumbo in las vegas\". Oyster Bar at Palace Station came up as the top result. Got there about 9:30pm, but didn't get seated until after 10:30pm. This place is small, (I think it only seats about 15 or so people). Long wait, old smokey casino - what better way to spend your time after a long day at work ;) After finally getting seated, I ordered the Etouffee with a spicy level of 8. Wife got the gumbo. They cook everything in front of you, (by the way, the Filipino cook kinda resembled Deuce Bigalow).  I'm glad I waited because that stuff was off the hook! It was a huge bowl, with a scoop of rice. I managed to inhale the whole thing in about 15 minutes. It was at that time that my wife noticed me eying her gumbo and immediately pulled her bowl away from me - i wanted to finish that one off too! The servers are nice and friendly. The only thing I regret not doing is getting another order to go. My wife couldn't finish hers and took it to go. Unfortunately for her, she woke up late the next morning, and the gumbo was calling my name! I think I'll be going here at least once a month. For those of you who want your kids to experience the food here - too bad, gotta be at least 21 to sit at the bar. Get 'em an order to go.",

    "text": "Oyster Bar is known for their steam kettle cooking and FRESH seafood. Their menu ranges from raw oysters on the half shell to bouillabaisse to jambalaya to clam chowder and gumbo. So while the boyfriend and I were on one of our Vegas trips, we decided to trek off the strip to Palace Station so I can try this famous steam kettle cooking.  Oyster Bar is a very small restaurant. It is literally a bar counter with roughly 10-12 seats. So coming during lunch or dinner hour is probably not a good idea - expect to wait at least 1.5 hours. But being that it is 24 hours and opened 7 days a week, come when everyone else is passed out in their rooms. We went pretty early on weekday, so we got seats right away. Having our mind set on the famous pan roast, we decided to also get the steamed New Zealand mussels as an appetizer. You can't really go wrong with steamed fresh mussels, drenched in a light butter broth that you can literally drink like water. Although I would definitely not mind ordering this again, there are a few other items on their menu that I would like to try.  After devouring the mussels, our pan roast finally came. And man was it worth the 30 minute wait. Pan Roast is fresh seafood sauteed with brandy, cream and tomato. At Oyster Bar, you can order it with shrimp, crab, lobster, or all three. You also pick your spice level, anywhere between 1-10, 10 being the spiciest. We got the combo pan roast at level 7. Served with a huge scoop of rice in the middle of the bowl, your first bite will keep you coming back for more and more. The sweetness from the tomato mixed in with the savory spices creates an ultimate foodgasm in your mouth. It's ridiculous. You get this vibrant flavor, on top of fresh pieces of crab, lobster, and shrimp. The texture and the taste combination that comes in a single bite is amazing. I'm salivating just talking about this meal!  Although a bit on the pricier side, the portions are pretty big. My boyfriend and I ordered the mussels and the pan roast and were pretty stuff. But I wanted more! I had to say no because I knew there are not that many bathroom stops on the 5-hour drive home. Service was good - nothing I can really complain about. The wait is just long, because you have one chef cooking 12 orders in about 6 kettles so it's torture. I think I would drive out to Vegas for a day or two just so I can eat here. It is that good, but gas is too pricey and the sportsbook likes to steal my money, so I'll just have to wait a few months until I am reunited with Mr. Oyster Bar :) There are SO many places to eat in Sin City, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you come to Oyster Bar @ Palace Station.",

I've read a lot of reviews that said the wait was long. Luckily for my boyfriend and I, we did not have to wait and were seated right away. The restaurant is very casual and the service is casual as well. I don't mind it since the food was extremely delicious. We ordered a dozen oysters and the Pan Roast. The oyster were really fresh and the dipping sauce was delicious too. The Pan Roast, on the other hand, was so delicious. It was one of the highlight point of the entire trip there. Writing this review makes me feel hungry for the Pan Roast. It's that good! I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Man, it effing hit the spot.   Like most of the other reviews say, there was a bit of a wait. We arrived about 230 or 3 ish, and still had to wait to sit - and then about another half hour wait to get our food. Worth it? Definitely. I probably wouldn't try and go during 'normal' hours, because I can't even imagine waiting that long. Going so late was perfect for us.  Get the pan roast, for sure. We got the palace pan roast and the combo roast. I preferred the combo which had lobster, shrimp, and crab - as opposed to the palace which had chicken in addition to the other things listed - as well as some other stuff, I think ! It's pretty cool, because you can watch them cook your food. Kind of bad I guess, you start drooling over all the deliciousness. And sometimes you get really hopeful that the food they are cooking is yours - but sadly, it isn't. Be patient - super worth it.   Service was great too. Hollowman single-handedly made the experience. He was so friendly. You can tell he cares about what he's cooking. I would go back just for him.   Great, great, great.

    "text": "Yes, all of the above and below reviews say it all - this place is mind-blowing! For you savory and spicy seafood seekers here is your haven.    The Food- Choose from fresh oysters on a half shell that are so fresh and briny that you might just need to check yourself and step out of the Palace Station looking for the ocean.  Start with these then definitely choose from the pan roast or jambalaya. You can indicate your heat level from 1-10 so go for it.  If you don't like slimy okra you might want to ask them to remove it but it does add a bit of an earthy flavor.  I also recommend you ask for the rice on the side so it doesn't get lost in the thick delicious tomato-cream base of the pan roast or the thick Cajun creole spiced base.   The Ambiance - casual and unpretentious. If you get the Maya Rudolph look-a-like server you be sure to be entertained (tip graciously she has baby #4 on the way). Despite what others have said about showing up on off-hours to grab a seat, this is all False. There is no optimal time. Come on people in 20 years this place has had almost every seat filled 24 hours round the clock so it's basically luck if you don't have to wait an hour or two. Be prepared and have a small meal a few hours in advance so you can truly enjoy your experience.  M",

Not that waiting is an issue with Oyster Bar...waiting is just a necessary prelude for a dynamic finale, namely the food.  Any wait time for good food is excusable.  It's better to wait for good food for an hour or two then to eat at an establishment that serves mediocrity.  My brother found this place on Yelp.  I really want to thank my brother and all the Yelpers that submitted honest reviews of this place to make us come here.  The food is simply...amazing!  Thanks everybody!  I really want to keep this place hush hush but seems like I'm too late, the word has already spread around Yelp that Oyster Bar is the real deal.  Surprise, surprise, we sat next to some Yelpers and people who came because of the Yelp reviews of Oyster Bar, today, during lunch.  It's a small world after all...  First off, do yourself a favor and order the reasonably priced Fanny Bay oysters for $16.99.  It's hard to see that price for Fanny Bay anywhere else.  Secondly, as you're waiting for whatever delicious entree you ordered, munch on that awesome bread they gave you.  Ask for more bread for later to dip on your Palace Pan Roast ($22.99).  They offer you a heat level of 1 through 10.  Don't go showing off now!  A 7 is pretty hot already.  The cook and waiter told us stories of many people who couldn't handle a 10.  Don't be that guy!  We also had the Seafood Jambalaya ($23.99) at a level 6.  Just enough heat without losing the overall flavor.  In a nutshell, the food here is awesome, especially the Palace Pan Roast.  Most people usually lose when going to Las Vegas, don't you lose out by not coming to Oyster Bar!",

    "text": "Best Pan Roast Ever!!! I can stress enough how Awsome this place is, Thanks to my bro & his friends that kept telling me about this place if I ever visit Vegas. I now find myself telling my peeps about this place! I ALWAYS stop here before I head back home to Cali. This Is THE place to eat if you ever have a hangover, cold or simply just craving seafood and with a nice tall glass of beer?! It's the best! And Yes, the place only sits about 16 people so expect to wait awhile if you plan to eat here. Cause one time I got there around 9am Sunday and luckily my husband and I sat right a way, but not even 15 minutes after there was a line forming of at least 20+ peeps already waiting. I love spicy food so remember they scale in how spicy you want your food. I always get a 6, but I'm gonna try the 7 next time.",

This dish is sexy. Definitely not just a Wham Bam sexy either. She's smooth, bold and hot!!!   I ordered the Combo Pan Roast at a Level 10 for spice and the heat from the Habanero complimented the richness of the bisque. I savored each and every bite while trying to detect the ingredients that make it so incredibly flavorful. Is it Brandy or White Wine in the sauce? Who cares, I am so sold and chalking this down in my list for Top 5 Favorite Meals of All Time.   Yes, there was a wait and yes, I will wait again! The service and the dish were on point. I was left feeling completely satisfied and yet, the memory lingers in my mind......... Oh yes, we will meet again.",

    "text": "Worthy of the hype! The Pan Roast was wonderful and filled me up! It was filled to the brim with nice hearty chunks of seafood as well. It was good to see that they don't skimp on their portions. Also, the chef and server that manned the bar were super cool! Despite the fact that both of them were obviously working hard and constantly moving every single minute they were still having wonderful, pleasant conversation with the patrons of the bar. They would make jokes with one another and everything. They seem to remember quite a few people as well, they would constantly wave at multiple patrons passing by and some would come by and shoot the breeze with them. Some would joke around and they'd heckle one another. Seeing this kind of stuff is refreshing to me, as this world seems to be getting more and more impersonal by each passing day. These people clearly make an effort to remember their clientele.   Basically, once you're in the bar, things are absolutely amazing. It's the getting to the bar part that's the issue. This place isn't like other Oyster Bars; where you have the option of either sitting on the bar or one of multiple tables inside a mini-restaurant. The Oyster Bar at Palace Station is LITERALLY JUST A BAR. They could probably sit 18-25 people max. Remember, this place has AMAZING food and EXEMPLARY service, you combine that with the very small occupancy, and you get LONG ASS WAITS. I went there at 11:45 PM on a lazy, uneventful Sunday evening. I wasn't seated until 1:00 AM. I don't want to know how long the wait is on an 6:00 PM on a Friday. To top things off, the cell phone coverage sucks on the area where the line is, so I couldn't even goof around on the Internet on my phone. Also, with the very limited seating; it becomes more and more cumbersome when you're coming in with multiple friends. You'll probably want to come in with just one or two extra friends. Anymore than that, your wait will become more excruciating, as you'll be waiting for more seats to open up.   I will say that The Oyster Bat being so small adds a nice layer of intimacy to the experience, but ultimately it does more harm than good. Coming here means you have to devote a chunk of your day to simply waiting in line. And forget about bringing multiple people with you too. If your group becomes too large I'm sure they'll have to put in smaller groups of people who came in after you just so the lines not being completely help up.   WONDERFUL FOOD WITH A WONDERFUL STAFF otherwise. That wait in line is a hindrance though, and is the one thing that keeps this place from being absolutely perfect.",

The place is tiny and sometimes the wait could be long, but it's one of the few restaurants in Vegas that would survive in other cities.    You sit at the bar with like 20 seats total.  The food is freshly prepared before your eyes.  The crowd is a pretty interesting, I saw one women take a nap in the middle of her meal.    I tried the lobster pan roast, house gumbo, oysters, and clams.  Everything was pretty darn good and portions are very generous - so be careful not to over order like we did ! .",

The food is very good even if somewhat overpriced. The problem is the waiting in line, and there always seems to be a long line no matter when we go. Recent reviews show that things haven't changed. Don't feel like standing in line in the middle of a smoke filled casino floor while waiting for food. I don't know, maybe they can implement a buzzer system so people can wander off while waiting? On a day like today when I'm feeling some clam chowder, it sure would be nice to have the Oyster Bar as an option, but once again, we are discourgaed by a potential long wait in line.",

As you chug forward, you are greeted at the entrance of the palace station. Trains adorn the facade of the building, giving off a rustic old casino feel.  As you make your way through the smoke and haze, you find a little bar that radiates with happiness and glows like a diamond in the rough. The delicious scents of pan roast fill the air, and you can almost taste it...  But then you see the dreary line... You can see the  impatience and hunger, building and growing the farther you go down the queue. It's unfortunate that the bar can only seat about 16 people at a time, but human are resilient beings, and they are willing to wait for hours to have a taste of that silky tomato based pan roast!  It's a seafood lovers dream, the base is thick, but smooth. You can set the level in which you want to feel the spicy burn inflict your tongue from one to ten. The flavors are rich and full, they are quite generous in the portions, and require a $5 plate fee if you are considering sharing the dish.  The wait staff and cook all have a very nonchalant attitude, to give the customers a little punch in the face. Then you forgive them for their crassness because the food was so good.  You must try The Oyster Bar, when you are in the area, I just hope that you won't have to wait for more than an hour!",

The chef and the ladies working there are really nice and friendly. I order the pan roast combo my husband ordered the  bouill roast.  Spicy level- I got a 3 and it was perfect. My husband got a 7 and he said it was fine for him but I was not able to eat it, too spicy for me.  You get to see the chef prepare the food right there at the bar.  Oh my god! My food was delicious! A bowl of happiness!! Shrimp, lobster, crab in an amazing sauce with rice on the side.  My husband loves his as well! He drank some of the soup and can't stop saying how good it taste. His had clams, mussel, shrimp, crab and fish in a soup with a side of rice. I think it had more stuff in it but I can't remember what else.  Anyways you must try this place out!!

It's located in the Palace Station!   We sat ourselves and were greeted by Derek and Steve. Both are so welcoming and nice! They're both fun to talk to and you can tell they love their jobs! They made the experience even better!   We got our drinks and ordered the New England clam chowder bowl for $8.99. They have a cup which is 5.99! They were nice enough to put them in small bowls so the man and I could evenly split it. Of course with those crackers that make the chowder so good! It was so good! Perfectly seasoned as well. We got one plate of the panroast. We got one since we knew that we couldn't finish all of it last time. Huge portioning sizes! The panroast is the thing we come here for. I refuse to get it any where else. It's so delicious! It's a $20 plate but worth every bit of it! Best part is you get to watch Derek make his magic! We don't like rice too much so always get it with linguine instead. It's not extra for it either! You get to pick the spice level as well.   There's one in most (if not all) station casinos, but this is my favorite location! I highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "So this oyster bar is super popular during the holidays. Waited for 2.5 hrs to be seated for 4 people. When we finally got seated the waiter Steve was super nice! He joked with my family and I and gave us really good service.   We ordered a dozen oysters for starters. I saw Steve prepare the oysters and he was so fast in shucking them. So after about 5 mins we got our oysters. They tasted so fresh and good! For a dozen is cost $20. But it's so worth it! If you go between 1am - 9am it's like $10 for half dozen which is pretty good too because regular half dozen price is $13.99. The oysters were so fresh and believe me when I say that because once you eat the first one you can tell how fresh they are.   We had also ordered the claim chowder soups. OMGosh! They add so much claims in it! It's like the best! You can get a big (and I mean BIG) bowl for $8.99. Such a great deal with lots of claims. Tasted so good and not salty.   For the entrees, we orders the cioppino, gumbo, seafood jambalaya, and the etouffee. I thought it was so neat and interesting how they used the steamers on the counter to cook our food! It was so fun to watch it. I ate the house gumbo and it was so yummy~~ it was A LOT for the price of 23.99. So worth it because I couldn't even finish it! I love how this place gives big portions. My dad thought for the price and wait, this place wasn't that worth it but I think it's good. Maybe this weekend they didn't make it as great as they usually would have because of so much people waiting. The line got longer even after we sat down. But overall experience I thought it was worth it. It's better to share instead of ordering for yourself because the portions are big. My main point of coming here was for the oysters and they were GREAT ^_^",

The food was good but I wouldn't wait in line 2 hours again to eat here. Not sure what the hype is about. I had the Veasar sald and Claim closer as an appetizer and the Jambalaya as my entree. I actually enjoyed the soup and salad more than the Jambalaya. I would eat here again but I would not wait in a line for 2 hours again.;With that being said if I happen to be at Palace Station and the line here isn't long I may stop and eat but would never wait in a 2 hour line again wasn't worth it.",

I have eaten at the Sunset Station Casino location before but this was my first time at this one.  I like them both and will be back sooner than later.  Rio",

I wish people didn't like this place as much and would stop spreading the word, but I have nothing better to do as I stand and wait myself...so here goes my rant:  1. Food is amazing 2. Yes, it is worth it. 3. Do not send one person to wait in line for a party of ten because all the people behind your big party will give you the eye as you eat and make you feel incredibly uncomfortable...as they should. It is not smart, it is RUDE!!!!!...to create the illusion that the line is shorter than it actually is.  If your friends/fam don't want to wait in line, they don't deserve to eat.  PERIOD.  4. Do not sit in your seat for 30 minutes after you have finished eating your meal.  There's only 10 seats.  Get up and chit chat somewhere else so all the hungry monsters who have been waiting for over an hour can eat. It's called COURTESY. Seriously.  Everyone still waiting in line hates you. 5.  The food is amazing. 6.  Yes, it is worth it.  You will leave fulfilled, but angry at the world that people are rude and lack common courtesy. That is my public service announcement. Enjoy some damn good pan roast - the best you will EVER have.",

    "text": "Hard to say much that hasn't already been said about this place. As a native Floridian I'm very picky about seafood and wondered if they were a little overrated. Not to worry, their combination (shrimp, crab, and lobster) pan roast was one of the best seafood meals I've ever had. They use a cream/tomato base with some cooking wine and a spice level you pick from 1-10. I went 5 and it had a little kick without overpowering the flavor. The serving is massive and comes with some rice, it's pretty rich and two could easily share a bowl. The gumbo is just as excellent too if you'd rather try that. The meals are about $20-25 each and worth every cent.   I came around 11:30 pm on a Wednesday night and somehow only waited about 25 minutes for a seat. When you wait here you actually stand in line, no putting your name on a list. You could always bring a beach chair maybe if the wait is for hours? The service is really friendly and they cook everything right in front of you so you can watch for the 30 minutes or so it takes them to cook your meal.   This place is about a $20 cab ride from the strip is totally worth checking out.",

Level 7 was hot for me, level 3 gumbo didn't taste spicy at all. I wasn't a fan of the gumbo. I don't think the gumbo was worth the 2.5 he wait. But I can see how the pan roast is.   Their oysters are also really good. So while you're waiting for your food to be cooked, order some oysters! They have a midnight special on Oysters, like $10 for a dozen between 1am-5am (but don't quote me on that). I guess you have to choose a good time to go!",

The 2nd time we went was around  1pm on a Sunday and we waited approximately 1 hour & 47 minutes! HOWEVER, well worth the wait! Dolores was taking orders and Bob was cooking. What a great duo these 2 are! So funny and engaging! I had the palace pan roast (spicy level 8) on my 1st visit and that was really good, but tried the boullabaise on my 2nd visit and i have to say that was my favorite. So flavorful! I know the pan roast is a fan favorite, but if u get to go to the oyster bar a 2nd time, i highly recommend the boullabaise. Forget the buffets and just hit the oyster bar! Next time i visit i am going to try the oyster rockefeller. Now that looks deelish!",

Once I heard oyster I was all for it. I didn't think it would be anything crazy though. We waited in line for maybe 30 minutes on a Sunday. After going over the menu, I still didn't know what I was getting myself into. Sitting at the bar was a lot of fun, the chef and our server were very friendly and funny. I ordered the jumbalaya and my friend ordered the panroast combo so that we can share the two dishes. We also ordered oysters which were also really yummy and were cracked and brought to use very fast. Nothing compares to that feeling you get when your food comes out and it's all prepared and cooked in front of you so it is almost like a little tease. I wish I was a better writer so that I could properly described how amazing the panroast was. It's this creamy, buttery sauce with crab, lobster, shrimp, and a scoop of rice. I might've forgotten to include something, but my goodness I can't stop thinking about it! In others' reviews I've read, they compare it to The Boiler in Chino Hills which I also heard is the same owner of this place. I am so happy that I can satisfy my endless craving closer to home. I miss you Oyster Bar. See you soon",

Beware you will be sitting in a bar which probably only sits about 16-18 people. On a busy night it will be along wait, at least an hour. i think we ate an hour and a half after standing in line but well worth it especially with a tall glass of cold beer.",

And we knew exactly what we wanted when we got to our seat since we had been staring at the menu the whole time we were waiting in the line. So we ordered right when got seated, but it took about 45 minutes for us to receive our food because their pan roast takes a while to cook and they were already behind with the orders because they were so packed with people. So this is where they get the minus 1 star. With the food, wow! their oysters are awesome! Their pan roast - even better! I got the combo gumbo and combo pan roast for my husband. We both liked the pan roast better. I got it at 7 because I like it spicy - but honestly, it wasn't spicy enough for me. Clam chowder was good - decent flavor with lots and lots of clams. If you want to eat here, come at a really awkward time... like 3pm or 2am... because we left the bar at around midnight and there were still people waiting in line.",

    "text": "Okay. So I really wanted to love the food from this place because of all of the wonderful, raving reviews, but just didn't. Waited in line  for approximately an hour before being seated at the bar, but really wasn't bothered by the wait because the majority of reviews said that the food was worth it. Ordered a half dozen of oysters on the half shell, and thought they were just mediocre- yes, they were very meaty, but I missed the saltiness/brine of traditional east coast oysters. Ordered the combo pan roast with shrimp, crab, and lobster, and it was just mediocre too.  While I found the food to be just, meh, the staff was lovely and worked very hard to please their customers. Would I come back to this oyster bar again on a return visit to vegas, no, but I'm glad I tried it because I would have always wondered if I was missing out otherwise. Now I know that I will not be missing out. Save your time and money for something else.",

(they close at 11pm) there is only about 18-20 stools to sit on, so be prepared that there are no tables available!",

    "text": "If you're a seafood lover like me, you'll love this place. You can't go wrong with the house pan roast! The consistency is rich and creamy, like a bisque, with huge chunks of seafood, cooked to perfection. I always get it with pasta but I end up eating it as a soup. As far as the spice level goes, I can't handle spicy foods so I usually go with a 4 but I've had a 7, which was a little overwhelming for me but still enjoyable. Don't forget to get the oysters which are always so fresh and so tasty (I mean, hello, it is a oyster bar)! Just put a splash of lemon with a dash of horseradish and cocktail sauce and I'm sure that will brighten anyone's day. Seating is very limited but I've only gone in the wee hours of the morning so I've never had to wait for a table. If you're lucky and you have the pleasure of having Ricardo as your chef, you'll be in for a treat. He's so friendly and makes the best pan roast ever! He's so awesome to the point where I'll be visiting him every time I'm in Vegas. In fact, I've appointed him my new Vegas BFF. Everyone go visit this place, you won't be disappointed!",

This place actually is a bar -- under 21, no deal -- and there's not much room so I'm guessing you have to wait if you go at a normal eating time.  We didn't.  It's at Palace Station Casino, and they've got a shuttle to/from Fashion Show mall which is way cool.  Shuttle is free (but tip the guy, will ya?)  Oysters were freaking huge and delicious.  So big points for the first dish.  #8 spiciness was a bold move, and I'll admit that my lips were burning, but I stand by it.  We needed some extra sourdough rolls to dull the pain, but damn damn damn that gumbo was good.  Crammed with shrimp cooked just right and tasty okra (and geeze, I don't even like okra! but I ate every bit) plus various other fishiness, I can't even describe how this masterpiece tasted.  Full of flavor, and the spice was not heat for the sake of heat -- this was delicious, full-bodied, kick you in the face in a nice way gumbo.",

Back then security guards always asked for my ID while I waited in line with my parents at the casino.  At last, I'm over 21 and I make Oyster Bar my number one stop every time I go to Las Vegas, and every time I get the seafood gumbo.  This gumbo is so decadent in taste, so flavorful, so amazingly good that my mouth is watering up as I'm writing this.  Now, I lOve spicy food, and I order the seafood gumbo with a 9, and it's pretty damn spicy.  My advice is to get a 6 if you can't handle spicy well but loves a kick to your gumbo.",

    "text": "Three weeks after our \"Las Vegas Food Tour\" we find ourselves back in Sin City. We were back for a friend's birthday and we arrived a day early. So for the few that came early, we decided to get something good before slurping down gallons and gallons of fat tuesdays and liquor that would eventually result in stuffing our faces with some trash fast food. This was a grapevine recommendation so I was a little reluctant but I'm no snob, I'll eat it if you say its good.   Keep in mind, this place seats about 14-18 people. Soo... depending on how large your party is the line can take quite a long time. For a group of four the wait was about 45 mins. It was tough especially because we were starving. But it is definitely worth the wait!   We ordered a dozen clams and half a dozen oysters as appetizers. This was more than enough for 4 people. The clams were ginormous, this was the first time that I ever had clams uncooked, but top them with some horseradish, cocktail sauce and your choice of hot sauce and you've got a ridiculous combination of flavors in your mouth. The clams and oysters were VERY fresh but not the best I've ever had. That award goes to Swan Oyster Depot in SF. They do have the best and only Pan Roast I have ever tasted on the other hand. We all got the combination Pan Roast that consists of shrimp, crab, and lobster. They also give you a choice of how spicy you want it with a rating of 0-10. I ordered a 4 and I though it was the perfect amount of heat. It tasted like a huge bowl of lobster bisque and I definitely wasn't complaining. The best thing to do IMO is to order one Pan Roast and get an extra order of rice for two people. Trust me... its plenty. We also topped it off with a $20 bottle of wine which is a steal for Vegas. This place is a definite hidden gem in the long lost Palace Station. I will definitely be back!",

The Pan Roast was pretty rich and reminded me of a cream of tomato base loaded with tons of seafood. I can't lie that everyone else around us was ordering the Gumbo and I wished I had room to order that as well, but there was no way. I'll have to leave that for my future trip to Vegas. The only cons I thought there were was that there was a long line for tables since the seating area is just the bar area. Had to wait at least 45 minutes even at 9:00pm. Good comfort food and it's definitely entertaining watching them cook your dishes in front of you. Check it out.",

This location is very small (the seating is around a dozen stools and the chefs prepare and cook everything right there in front of you), so get there early if you want to avoid the crowd. I love love love love the House Gumbo (the deluxe version of Gumbo with sausage, chicken, and seafood). Although I have tried other menu specialities, I keep getting the House Gumbo. I've found that how great your meal is, really depends on the cook (I like my gumbo spicy). The portions have gotten slightly smaller over the years, but I still eat half, and save half for later. Meals (gumbo or pan roast dishes) come with crackle bread (generous serving), a hard roll, and a scoop of rice. Also, this location does not serve Jambalaya anymore. So, we go to the Sunset Station's Oyster Bar, because my husband really likes the Jambalaya. I've given this place five stars because I have never been disappointed, the service is really good, and even on a busy day, you can get a really good meal here- it's still worth the wait, anyway. If you want gumbo, this is the place for you. (The pan roast is more creamy and I am not a creamy sauce person.)",

The only reason why I took one star away is because of the ridiculous line that you always have to wait in, but people are always willing to wait cause it's so good! If you're not from Las Vegas just wait the ridiculous line because it's worth it.   There's only a few seats that's why it always takes like a hour before you sit. Also, this is a 21 and up bar so no one under 21 can eat at the bar.  This oyster bar is always open for 24 hours 7 days a week, so you are able to get this after the club. But be warned there is always a line. Unless you are like a magical unicorn and get really lucky and there's no wait!   I usually get the Combo Pan Roast! I swear the chefs are like super magicians because it always tastes amazing! I've never tasted pan roast like this before! I like to get either the rice or noddles on the side because if you put it together I feel like the noddles and rice would get too soggy! The food portion is really huge so if you eat only a little it's all good because this pan roast is still good the next day. It still tastes amazing! This meal can defiantly be shared with two people and still take a little home!   I also get oysters and they are so huge and fresh that you would be surprised!   But seriously this place is amazing! Try it once and you'll be hooked and want to go all the time when your in Las Vegas!",

The palace pan roast is my absolute fav - shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage in a creamy tomato sauce with a scoop of rice. I'm drooling as I type! Lol large portions too.

We got: a dozen oysters (16.99) Bowl of New England clam chowder(8.99) Combo pan roast-level 5 spicy  (23.99)  You get served a sourdough roll. It's pretty good. Everything we ordered was delicious! Although we could probably do without the clam chowder but I was craving it ahaha.  It wasn't too spicy for me and it was very filling.  Oysters were really fresh, a bit gritty, but still good.  Bob was our cook and he did a fantastic job serving everyone on a timely manner.  Margie was our waitress and she was also efficient with getting us everything and making sure our waters were filled.  Thanks oyster bar!",

    "text": "Being from San Francisco, I'm pretty picky about seafood. With that said, this place is INCREDIBLE. Who would have thought that you could find such amazing seafood in the middle of the desert? I was recently in Las Vegas for a conference, and my boyfriend and I came here two nights in a row. The first was a Saturday night/Sunday morning around 5 a.m, and we probably waited about an hour for a spot at the 18-seat bar. There was no wait at around the same time the next night. My boyfriend is super impatient and hates to wait for anything, but even he declared that the food was totally worth it.   The two servers were super efficient and personable. I didn't catch their names; one just told me to call him \"baby\" and the other looks like Walter White from Breaking Bad, albeit a million times less grumpy.   For starters, we had a dozen oysters on the half shell ($17.99 from 1-9 a.m.) and the New England clam chowder ($7.99 a bowl). The oysters were fresh and perfectly briney, and the cocktail sauce had a nice horseradish kick to it. The clam chowder was way better than the over-hyped Boudin, in my opinion, with big chunks of meaty clams. The sourdough rolls they served with the meal went perfectly with the chowder.  For our entrees, we split the combo pan roast ($21.99) and the bouillabaisse ($23.99). Boyf really enjoyed the bouillabaisse; a \"classic French stew with onions, celery, shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels and clams.\" He's a huge carnivore, and this dish was packed with seafood in a light spicy broth. For me, the pan roast stole the show; a rich, almost creamy sauce with huge chunks of jumbo shrimp, clams, and lobster. While not as meat-heavy as the bouillabaisse, the sauce was simply amazing with the heaping scoop of rice that accompanied each portion. Another tip - when they ask how hot you want it, maybe err on the more mild side. I love spicy food and I put Sriracha pretty much on everything, but I'm definitely not a champ. We ordered a spice level 6/10 the first day and my face was flushed and sweaty within 2 bites. The flavors were so good though, that I had to keep trucking even through the burn.   Bottom line: come on a weeknight or early morning for the best experience. And even if you have to wait, totally worth it!",

I've heard great things about this place so it was a must try when in Vegas. I arrived around 10:00 on a Saturday night and wasn't seated till midnight. The 2 hour wait wasn't that bad since I was running back and forth to the Irish pub across the way for drinks.   I opted for the Palace Pan Roast with shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage level 8 spicy. HOLY MOLY, this dish was super delicious!! Every bite was pure creamy heaven with succulent shrimps and the flavorful andouille sausage just made it that much better. I licked my bowl clean. It was that good and totally worth the 2 hour wait.",

    "text": "Our 1st time here. I cannot Believe we've been missing this the whole time we been going to Vegas. The first thing I did when I got home @cali was Thank my friend for telling us about The Oyster bar). It's only been a day since we got back home. I was craving for it for some more. And planning to go back with our kids to vegas for the summer vacation. And really hoping to take the kids to try it, when my wife told me. It's 21 and over. I guess we are ordering 3 To Go pan roast next time. 1 for my kids, 2 for me LOL. We went @12pm: as much i would like to finish the whole pan roast, but ended getting a to go bags. Mind you I was eating the rest for 2 days. We even went to look for a rice (thanks for a thai restaurant open till 4am). Ordered rice only to go (LOL) so I can finish eating the pan roast. Still did not finish it. I Finish the pan roast on the road while driving to cali (wife was feeding me, Not eating by my self and driving at the same time). We would have comeback if wife don't have an appointment with someone (so really did not have time to go back).  To the people who have NOT TRIED IT:  You must try it, the wait & price is worth it.   Combo Pan Roast rice on the side: (My Favorite).  Bouillabaisse (wife ordered this) it was good too, lots of really fresh (really, really fresh seafood). And did I mentioned really fresh seafood enough. Hangover food (your in vegas, definitely you will have a hangover in the morning.   Oysters on the Half Shell: I have eaten a ton of oysters... THIS IS THE BEST OYSTER THAT I HAVE EATEN IN MY LIFE... My Big Tip (Order a dozen). Now my picture says. Oyster Bar was top 6 in America by  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FJaunted.com&s=349073a5e52294d58e65f13068dc141683abc64cefc91085e541f5cc89240367\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jaunted.com</a>. I know it not fair to the other 5 oyster bar since I have not eaten at their establishment. BUT SINCE I HAVE NOT EATEN AT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT!!!  THE OYSTER BAR @PALACE STATION IS THE #1 OYSTER BAR IN AMERICA, PERIOD!!!!! please do not argue this one with me, your are not going to win with me. LOL.  I have not even touch base with the people who work there. They have made the experience better too.  Filipino cook (friendly, funny): the lady behind us at the line started getting worried since the filipino cook left the station. She ask the  host/waiter/server where he go. She said he just took a break. The lady said, you better make sure he is the one cooking for us when we get seated cuz I am not waiting for this long if he not the one cooking our food. She was talking to my wife, she said they been going @Oyster bar for 20 years and always eaten there before they head back home. Host/waiter/server friendly and funny too. 2 guys in front of us on the line (who also told us they been going here for 12 year) called her to tell her theres already 2 open seat. Took her apron tell them, don't tell her what to do (with a smile)... Clean the tables. And comeback to them I'm sorry sir but were already closing. Lol. Guys was just laughing the whole time.   Ever heard the saying, IF PEOPLE LINE UP FOR HOUR ON THE RESTAURANT YOU KNOW THERE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD..... This is it. People line up & wait for it.Even if they know they have the drive for 4/5/6 hours after to go home. People waiting tells you they have been going in the place for years and years. People are a regular. (Guy next to me is in a first name basis with the host/server). A guy like me who usually don't  write a book for a review, but since I really have a damn good time, great experience at this place that I cannot resist.    The Food, The Place, The Worker, The Customer = I have never eaten in a place where people all were talking about how good were the food is and all talking interacting to everyone.   We eat at fine dinning restaurant, we always love to eat out when were at Vegas (just this last trip we eat at: Nove@palms (I give them the view), The Grand Lux Cafe. But THE OYSTER BAR @Palace station TRULY made our last trip a wonderful experience.  Oyster Bar @Palace Station you have a new Regulars in us for as long as you be cooking for us...",

The wait that we are all reading about is very real due to all food being made from scratch with maybe only 6 pots at a time and very limited seating available. We arrived at 12PM. There were 6 people ahead of us yet we had to wait for maybe 45 minutes before being seated. When we arrived, there were a few empty seats with dirty dishes that needed to be cleaned, yet the waitress was nowhere to be seen. She didn't arrive to clear the dishes and seat the next customers until maybe 15-20 minutes later.   We had the Pan Roast Combo and a Combo Boullabaise. Both spice level #7. Both were very very delicious. The pan roast definitely does deserve the praise. It is very rich but balanced out perfectly with all the spices. There were large chunks of seafood in both dishes.   TIP--Oyster Bar is not kidding with its spice level. I normally eat very very spicy stuff, but the bouillabaisse #7 was a bit too much for me. I would probably recommend a 5 to really enjoy the dish thoroughly if you want something spicy but enjoyable. Also, I would probably share the Pan Roast Combo and pay the $5 plate sharing fee instead of ordering two entrees. We were beyond stuffed after going through 3/4 of the entree.",

The bouillaroast was our favorite. Full of seafood too! Definitely a wait in line but not a deal breaker, service dependent upon who you had. Super impressed by one cook who was working so hard. He was busy busy busy and still smiling.  Will return no doubt. Sooo yummy!",

    "text": "Food was good but nothing special. The clams on the 1/2 shell were nice and fresh but the size was more in the Cherrystone to Top Neck range so keep the larger size in mind if you order them.  The oyster were a big disappointment which is a shame because it's an \"oyster bar\". The only oysters offered are standard \"Gold Band\", pre-shucked oysters. It was also disappointing to watch the shucker cut the gold band, haphazardly pop the lid and allow the very limited briny liquor to go down the drain as the oysters were then served on the top shell and not the \"cup\". They were fresh and nicely sized but I wouldn't recommend them because without that liquor, most of the flavor is lost.  The pan roast was tasty and they give you a generous portion. They ask how spicy you want it on a 1-10 scale. I went with a 6 and it was tolerable but in hindsight I probably should of gone with a 4. The service was friendly and once you're seated, it's a nice experience but I doubt I'd return anytime soon because of the wait. It is hard to justify waiting in line for 2 hours in a dark, very smoky and rundown casino because there are just so many other great places in town to eat without the hassle.",

My friend had been there a couple of times before and I was impressed that the server remembered him.  Everyone was friendly and helpful, and it's fun to watch them prepare the food.  We all had the combo panroast, which was absolute incredible. Tons of crab, lobster, and shrimp in a brandy/cream tomato sauce.  I had \"medium\" spicy which had a slight bite to it. It was super rich and delicious. It's now 5:15 pm and I'm still not hungry yet...  Definitely a must go to place...go early or be prepared to wait, but definitely worth it!",

Anyway, since I was alone, I got lucky and they sat me right away. The oysters were very large, larger than I had remembered them, but still very good. And the jambalaya was excellent, as I remembered. The price was high (also as I remembered), but if you like Creole cuisine, I can't think of a better place in Las Vegas than this one. They're open 24 hrs., so their chefs vary, but they are all quite competent. There was a line for parties of 2, 3, and 4, because the bar only has about 20-25 seats, but if you are a patient person, it's worth the wait. I'm a big fan.",

    "text": "The lowdown: So, if you can roll with the punches, you aren't too hungry, you're not in a hurry, and you love seafood with a kick, this is a delicious place to eat. I would readily go again with who wanted to, but I'm not comfortable giving it a strong recommendation generally.  The food at Oyster Bar is *easily* five stars. The service knocks it down two just as surely. Be aware that this is a time commitment: we went for supper on a Tuesday night - we got in line shortly before six, and it was nearly ten when we left.  I don't mind waiting for good food - and the food is worth the wait! - but after about an hour and a quarter in line, when we sat down the service was terrible. It was twenty minutes after we were seated before anyone spoke to us (only to tell me that we couldn't order anything yet) and well over half an hour before we were served drinks. This wasn't all the server's fault - she seemed expected to do way more than she was capable of. She would disappear for long periods of time, making it very difficult to order if you needed something - and we did. One more staff member to bring drinks to the line, prepare salad and appetizers, and bus dishes could have made a big difference. That said, she didn't manage the situation well - it's great to keep a good disposition, but razzing customers who are unhappy is no good. I felt badly for having recommended the place.   We ordered a dozen oysters to share and a pan roast each. The oysters are huge and delicious, but we watched her pour the liquor out when she shucked them - what a waste! My only complaint about the food.   The pan roast, though - *so* good. Easily the best thing I ate in Vegas. All of the soups and sauces are prepared in this neat contraption with six small soup vats, so you can watch the whole process from your spot at the bar. The cooks are friendly and will answer questions and chat with you (but not assist the server). The combo pan roast was outstanding, and you can order it with a kick. There's lots of perfectly cooked seafood, not just a couple of shrimp like there can be some places, and the portions are extremely generous. Despite all the downsides of our experience, I'm thinking back fondly on the food. I wish we'd been able to bring home leftovers!",

The wait was about 30 minutes (this was a short wait since it was slow for them).  I had the bouillabaisse. Wonderful. Very flavorful. Also ordered the oysters. Not my favorite but still good. Staff was friendly. The chef has 6 pots to cook in so your wait time also can be determined by when your ordered was place and how many people are ahead of you as the chef can only cook 6 orders at a time. Worth the wait. Average wait from what I hear is 90 minutes. One customer I spoke with there was on New Year's Eve and they waited 3 hours.",

So this place is located inside the casino and the wait sometimes takes a while so I suggest coming here a bit earlier before your hunger strikes. Before they use to just have a made up line on the side of the bar but now there's actually velvet ropes to line up in. The place is a small bar-like structure that curves around the cooking area and the prep area.   What I always get when I come here is the seafood mix pan roast! It has crab chunks, shrimp, and lobster for $24.99. Sounds kinda pricey for pan roast right? But the size of the pan roast is pretty big! So pan roast is more like a creamy bisque that is made of heaven and some tomatoes and other stuff. But nonetheless creamy dreamy heavenly bisque filled with large servings of seafood!!! When you order, you get a roll of bread, a decent size helping of rice and the glorious sized pan roast. I'd compare  the size of the bowl to a small mixing bowl. It's enough for my sister and I to share the bowl and still be full.   I always see a lot of people order their own bowls but end up not finishing it or taking it home. I'm not sure how it is to reheat it later, but sharing it for us is always enough. All in all, whenever I have an itch for pan roast, this place is the place to go!!! Painful wait sometimes but so worth it!",

Steve was the cutest and was also our server, but really everyone takes turns helping customers out with whatever they need. Plates here are HUGE. So either come VERY hungry or if you're okay with only trying 1 thing, then order 1 plate and an extra side of rice to share. 1 plate can feed at least 2 people comfortably! The sauce was everything and was sooooo savory, buttery, and delicious. I had the lobster pan fry and I did not regret it! The hugest chunks, all of which were plentiful (they don't skim out!).

    "text": "I reviewed this place years ago and never really felt the need to update it... until now. This past trip to Vegas, we came here as usual. But I did something different this time. I ordered the not so secret menu item, the Bouilla-roast. It is a game changer. If I could give the dish more than 5 stars, I would!  The Bouilla-roast is essentially the bouillabaisse and the house pan roast in one dish. When they make it, they add less of the tomato cream sauce and use more seafood broth. You get the seafood selection from the bouillabaisse. This includes crab legs with the shell on, which actually affects the whole dish. The shells give the broth more flavor and I could really taste that difference (my husband for the house pan roast as usual and I used it for comparison). There's tender pieces of white fish from the bouillabaisse as well. I could never finish my food here... until I had the Bouilla-roast. I wanted to lick my bowl!  Prepare for a long wait. Remember that there's probably more people in line than you thing because only a couple people from a larger party are actually physically in line.  I do think the casino could benefit from making a waitlist, either paper or electronic, so that people don't have to physically wait in line. If there was ana electronic wait list with a phone number, people could roam the casino and gamble, hence making the casino more money... that's just my recommendation!",

Got the pan roast. And it was good, but I saw other people having the boulle roast, and should've had that instead. It looked much more appetizing to be with all that seafood. The pan roast definitely had a good amount of seafood and with the rice, it blends well together. The pan roast is tomato based bisque, so skip if ur not into tomatoes, and a strong taste of cream. Very basic bisque, didn't know what I was expecting. But the food was good. Will come back and try the other things. The oysters and clams were also fresh.",

Only downside is that I wish they were naturally sweeter. You get a very clean and fresh ocean taste.   The Manhattan Chowder at level 4 spicy had the perfect kick. The bowl was enough to share between three people and we were incredibly satisfied. There was just sooo much flavor.   Overall, everything is freshly made to order and served piping hot. I love that. Only downside is long wait times! I suggest coming after you've been out partying. There was a 30 min wait at 3AM. There's also $1 oysters for happy hour 5-10 AM!",

    "text": "The Oyster Bar is located inside the Palace Station casino and it is exactly what the name implies--a bar with a few seats around it! There is a velvet rope line to wait across from it in the midst of gaming machines.  While the Oyster Bar is open 24/7, it is constantly busy and everyone is expected to wait in queue.  About 45 minutes later, I was seated (and was informed that it was a \"short\" wait!) Again, seating was at a bar, which means mobility devices such as scooters and wheelchairs may not be accessible.  We were quickly handed menus and shown the specials of the day. I ordered a cold seafood platter as an appetizer and the combo pan roast as a main course. You are allowed to choose the spiciness level of your pan roast from 1-10 and I selected 8 since I do prefer my food on the hot side.  The appetizer came with some boiled shrimp, steamed clams, raw oysters, and condiments consisting of cocktail sauce, horseradish, and lemons. The food was fresh, served over a bed of ice, and delicious.  The pan roast combo came with a side of jasmine rice and a dinner roll. Overall, it was delicious: the texture creamy, it contained good sized chunks of seafood, and came out steaming hot. The spiciness level I ordered was enough for me to break out a sweat, but YMMV on that.  Despite being constantly busy, the service was excellent and the staff remained cheerful. Waiting in line at the Oyster Bar is part of the schtick so if you need to burn time before having a wonderful meal, I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 (43/100)  I have a hate-love relationship with this place. LOL. I absolutely love the food here but I really hate how long the wait is. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  The Oyster Bar is literally just a bar. Located smack dab in the casino area of Palace Station, there are only about 15 seats, and it's first-come first-serve seating. You wait in line, and they seat you as a spot opens up. I've always had to wait at least 30 minutes, usually more, to get seated. But I always keep coming back because I love the food so much!  My favorite dishes to get are the Alaskan Chowder and the Pan Roast. The Alaskan Chowder is similar to your classic clam chowder, only better! It has shrimp, crab, and lobster! Plus you get to decide the spice level for it. The added kick definitely makes it taste better. The Pan Roast is a creamy tomato based dish with seafood and served with rice. Super yummy as well! The portions are pretty big, so I usually share with someone, or if I get my own, I'll definitely have yummy leftovers for later.  Since this place is open 24 hours, I suggest going at really odd hours to have the shortest wait time. I mean, there's still bound to be a wait because it's Vegas and people are always out & about at all times throughout the day. I've gone around 2am and 4pm, and still had to wait, but less than an hour. I definitely don't recommend going at normal meal times or you'll be waiting forever.",

While there are other locations that are still delicious, the atmosphere here really adds to the experience.  First of all: you will probably wait in line. It's worth it.   I've rarely waited less than an hour so grab a drink and tag each other out of the line to have a wander while waiting.  The food: you really can't go wrong. Everything is so flavorful that I've never left without feeling stupidly full. \"Why did I do this to myself again?\" I ask as I waddle away from the bar. Because you must.   The staff is always friendly and willing to have a quick chat if the crowds permit. It's like you've been welcomed into someone's kitchen.  Anyway, do yourself a favor and come to this place but let's coordinate first so you don't make my wait time longer!",

An employee was telling us lines can be up to an hour.  We came around 1pm on a Saturday and the line was fairly short (lucky for us).  The line starts across from the bar so look for the line and don't mistakenly try to sit at the bar if you see an open seat....you will get glares from the salivating people in line.  You have been warned!  An employee will clear the bar and let you know when it is your turn to be seated.  You can see the chef cooking everything at the bar and the smells!!!!! You get tantalizing, mouth drooling smells of spices, garlic, and butter!  There is a slew of different hot sauces at the bar too. My fave was the garlic hot sauce!  It is a fun atmosphere!  Everyone is seated around the bar so you naturally have conversations with the people around you! The chef asked everyone how their meal was. He could of course tell by how everyone was devouring their plates with runny noses :)  The jambalaya and combo pan roast were so delicious! The spice level for dishes is 1-10, and a 5 is just right if you want a little spice but not have it be overpowering. The pan roast had huge shrimps, clumps of crab, and big chunks of lobster!!!  Ohhhh just writing about it makes me drool!!  Seriously, the pan roast is the way to go for first-timers to The Oyster Bar.  Shout-out to the employee who packed our leftovers.  She wrapped everything in saran wrap so no leaks on the way home!",

There is limited seating and always a line, complaining the whole time you're in said line won't change that. Station Casinos is very aware of how successful and popular this restaurant is, if they wanted to expand it they would, they just put millions of dollars into a remodel, they pay several people to run numbers and decide what should be upgraded, you complaining the whole time you're in line won't make them expand it. There are a limited number of cooking kettles and employees that fit behind the bar, even if there's seats open that doesn't mean there are kettles open. From my experience they tend to wait till kettles are open before seating people or wait till a few groups are done to walk around to clean seats. Everyone is working super hard back there and complaining the whole time you're in line that they could clean one spot and seat one person won't make that happen.   Be patient, the food is worth it and try to enjoy the experience and if you can't at least don't stand in line and complain the whole time so you ruin everyone else experience.",

You're basically waiting amongst the slot machines.   The food! We ordered 2 plates for the 3 of us. We even had left over. It was everything.

    "text": "So at first look it appears to be just a little counter like all the other little bar areas, but once you get a whiff of panroast combo smell, its much more intriguing.  I went for the first time about 10 years ago and I was warned by a co-worker that the line may take hours.  My friend and I took turns standing in line while the other stretched out and wandered the casino.   This time we decided to try to arrive late 11ish on a weekday.  It worked great, only 20 minute wait with two people in line.  That's my secret tip if you handle eating that late at night.  I also learned that you can order to go as well.  I figured my dad would like to try it, but would never wait in line that long or eat that late.   The staff are all friendly with fun personalities and seem to enjoy the work.  I think many of the workers there were the same ones as the first time I ate there.  They have since renovated the bar to include 20 seats.  The seats are nice and comfy.  Everything is as clean as one would expect for a high traffic oyster bar.    Finally it's all about the food.  I personally didn't eat any oysters, but other seemed to enjoy it.   The two times I've been there, I ordered the Panroast Combo.  It's so buttery, creamy and delicious.  It's like a lobster bisque gumbo with crab, shrimp and lobster.  It comes with rice, and bun on the side.  At least at this point in my life, it's top five best foods I've ever tasted!  It's that good for my taste buds. Just don't wear clothes that are too tight or the seams will bust when you're done.",

    "text": "You might need to look for the line if its your first time, but regardless, there'll be a wait at most hours. The question is how long? Is it 10 minutes or 2 hours?   If you think it'll be faster to order to-go, unfortunately you'll have to still wait in line as there's no separate line.  Why does it take so long you might ask? Well, everything is made to order and it's done in these cooking stations right in front of the patrons. There are only 6 stations.   After a week of being under fed / under nourished, we ordered a dozen oysters, the pan roast, bouillabaisse, and jambalaya. It seemed aggressive as the people next to us were like, it's like 2 servings per dish... and for 2 people to order 3 dishes and oysters... well.   Its very no frills - there's no need to rush. They serve you in the order you were seated. Be patient. Order, wait, eat, chill, have a beer.  Anyway, all the food was super on point. The gold band oysters are REALLY BIG. For all the dishes, I wish I ordered it just a little bit more spicy, but the flavour is really good regardless.  Highly recommended and will definitely return.",

That is impressive because we waited an hour to get a seat and people would wait no matter how long the line is for the chef D. Brown.  We ordered 3 dozen oysters on the half shell and the house gumbo that has lobster crab and shrimp. Wow was it amazing and the chef really puts his heart into his food which why they are 4 1/2 stars on yelp with all the reviews.   Truly impressive so don't blink an eye or you might miss it. We will definitely be back every time we come to Las Vegas.  Thank you once again chef D. Brown and fantastic job.",

    "text": "Oyster Bar is one of those places that is \"worth the wait\"!    I have been there a couple of times now... and the first visit was met with almost two-hour wait.  I am so glad that I stuck it out because the Combo Pan Roast was what dreams are made of!    I have also tried the oysters and I think everyone should at least try them at some point... as they are very good.  BUT... the restaurant should probably be named \"Pan Roast Bar\".  Or even \"Bouillabaisse Bar.\"  Of course, neither of those names have quite the same ring to them as Oyster Bar.  And since the name is probably not going to change anytime soon, let's just go with it.  Anyway, I digress... the Combo Pan Roast is creamy, delicious, and packed with lobster, crab, and shrimp!  All for about $24!    On my second visit, I learned the best tip from a local who had been there \"around 100 times\"... he suggested getting the Lobster Pan Roast AND adding crab to it.  This ends up costing a few extra dollars, but the combo pan roast is packed with A LOT of shrimp.  And let's face it, when ordering a dish with lobster, crab, and shrimp, the shrimp is the seafood that you want the least of.  This local's pan roast was PACKED with lobster and crab!   A thing of beauty that satisfies all of the senses!  *****FIVE STARS*****",

    "text": "The best ever!! A must when you come to Vegas.  They are located in Palace Station - a little past the table games. It's a bar top little restaurant that fits 10-15 people at a time. As you walk up to Oyster Bar, there's a waiting area to the right - a set of slot machines and a roped area.  WARNING: depending on the length of the line and people eating at the counter, the wait time can be a few hours. Also, 21 and over only.  Believe me when I say it is worth the wait. This is the ONLY place I will wait in line for hours. The longest I had to wait was 1.5 hours. My mind wanted Oyster Bar and I was going to get it no matter how long I had to wait.  The staff includes 2 chefs (one was in training), 1 server, and back of the house employees. The server is always on top of his/her game - clearing and wiping the counter tops, refilling drinks, recording orders, going out to the line and asking people how many in the party, organize chairs accordingly, give bread and utensils, and conversing with the customers. I mean - WOW! This person does all this and then some. The chefs on this day were working hard and pushing out orders quickly - not too much conversation. My previous visit I had Chef Bob. He's so funny and great to talk to. This is a man who clearly loves his job.  Okay, to my entree - I had the seafood pot roast. Absolutely DELICIOUS. You are given a large bowl of stew with different types of garnishes, seasonings, and seafood with a scoop of rice. This entree can be easily split between two people. I advise you to be careful with the spicy level - it's no joke. I got a level 5 and that brought just enough heat to my liking.  Like any other downtown casino, it was a bit smokey but the people are very friendly and easy to talk to. The waiting area - well, there's not a good place to put it and I think they have a great system.  Please go here and have a great time!!",

    "text": "Throughout the entire weekend in Vegas, my friend was raving about how this place has her favorite pan roast (and she's tried many). So of course, on our very last day in Vegas, we had to make a stop here before heading back to SD.   This Oyster Bar is on the first floor in the middle of Palace Station. There's only about 18-20ish seats available, so it can take a really long time if you have a larger group. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes to an hour. I'm not going to lie... ya girl got pretty hangry by the end of the hour and I'm sure I was giving the death stare at the people who we were waiting on to finish. I enjoyed the fact that there were screens with fun facts and little tidbits about the meaning behind gumbo or why lobster/crab meat is pink as it provides a bit of entertainment while you're just standing around.   I recommend looking at the menu and figuring out what you want to pick before you're seated so you can be considerate for the people who are going to be eating after you! You don't want to be wasting their time just like you wouldn't want to your time to be wasted.   We ordered the New England Clam Chowder in a cup ($5.99) which was actually still a very generous portion, and was easily shareable amongst two people. The soup was wonderfully creamy and thick, and the clams pink and chunky. We also ordered the Combo Pan Roast ($24.99) containing shrimp, crab, and lobster. This was really fun to watch the chefs prepare as they cook the food (mostly just the pan roasts) right in front of you! My friend and I ordered it at a level 5 spiciness which had a nice amount of heat comparable to that of a jalapeno... actually.. maybe a little spicier than that. But the pan roast was decadent. The stew I wish I could have literally slurped it up with a straw, oh my goodness it was that delicious. The lobster was cut up into chunks and the shrimp was already peeled. My only qualm was that the crab pieces were small and shredded and you couldn't really tell it was in there as it seemed to have melted into the stew. It's a very small qualm and not one to have taken away from the experience.  I definitely recommend getting it with the rice, as the rice soaks up all the delicious tangy flavor while the pasta just seems to continue to cook in the stew making it too soft for my liking.   Truly I loved my experience here even though I had to wait an extremely long time but I find it worth it. I'm excited to come back and try even more!",

    "text": "Located inside Palace Casino on Sahara.   Expect to wait in line, however ever now and then you get to be seated right away.  I recommend after two am on a weekday. Usually less cowards.   Definitely worth the super long wait, do not give up.   Usually do the calm chowder and a salad.  Work up to the Pan Roast with everything.  Oh my goodness, heaven in your mouth.  So much flavor. Creamy and spicy (pick your own heat level) with extra yummy.  I loVe it with white rice, however some individuals enjoy crackers. They provide you with a sour dough roll with every meal as well.   The alcohol selection is limited so get your drink on before you go over to oyster bar.  Mainly wine and possibly beer. Didn't notice drinks much was in awe of the chief.   The oysters are also good.  I just love the soups.",

My boyfriend ordered the oysters during happy hour but we both thought it wasn't worth the price still. You can can get better oysters somewhere else at a way better price.   Only plus side of our visit to this establishment were that the drinks were good and the Bouillbaisse was decent.   The service for this place was one of the worst.. The chef would roughly throw his cooking tools around and the hot water that was pouring from the sink almost hit me but I reacted and backed up.   The two servers were extremely rude. I asked for a to go box for my food about 20 minutes ago and she forgot. And she continued to ignore us. So I asked the other server and she ignored me and took someone else's order.   It really annoyed me how they didn't have a sign of what their happy hour for oysters was. And how they don't have a sign for customers to tell them to wait at the line until they are to be seated. I saw a lot of annoyed customers coming up to the table and one of the servers stated yo no, there's a line there, go back to it. They would have less issues if there was organization involved. But they clearly aren't.   The servers spoke to customers in a rude and rough manner. There was one customer that wanted an oyster shooter. But the server with glasses told him no, you only get water. The customer asked again why not. She replied, do I have to spell it out for you?   The customer got frustrated and didn't understand. She threaten the customer by saying \"Listen Honey, if you going to keep asking, I'm going to have to call security.. I didn't see a reason for her to be a bitch and beat around the bush. If she was just straight forward and told him how she believed he drank too much alcohol then he wouldn't have gotten aggressive. And there was no reason to treat him like he was stupid.   Overall, my experience was pretty shitty. It annoys me to have the servers here to be very rude to my boyfriend and I, and to the other customers. The food isn't worth the price in my opinion if the service was this terrible.   All the individuals in this establishment need to relearn how to do actual customer service. I also noticed one worker had music earbuds in while working. Great job guys, keep up the good work....",

I kid you not, I nearly cried/orgasmed with the sensation of joy of the fresh oysters, clams, and their hearty stewy dishes like the Boullabaise, the Gumbo, and the Pan Roast. OH the Pan Roast!  It's a small little bar, so the wait can get lenghtly. Food doesn't come out quick either so add that to the equation and you got yourself a hefty line. Thank goodness it's 24/7!   We started with the seafood combo of 3 large raw oysters, 3 large raw clams, and 3 shrimp cocktails. EACH was phenomenally delicious. Juicy of the sea, yet not fishy. Clearly, I was extremely impressed with this place. I loved the raw clams so much, I had to order a dozen more, and slurp them up with sauce, and fresh lemon squeezes. Heavenly.  The Seafood Pan Roast was lovely. If you're like me and love a kick, level 6 is a good one. Huge crab, lobster, and shrimp meat - with a tomato spice flavor, it was inexplicably sooooo delicious. I do recommend requesting the white rice on the side.  It's quite affordable for the luscious flavors and sinfully delicious experience you're gonna get. I already miss it. Take me with you!",

    "text": "As someone who was born and raised in Las Vegas, but has spent the better half of the last decade in New York, truly epitomizes what True Las Vegas dining is all about.   In my opinion, Las Vegas dining is a little different from New York dining because you have all the choices you want -- cuisines from A to Z, $ to $$$$ -- but the experience is different because the people and the culture are different. I think Vegas, being a service industry-driven city, showcases True hospitality in itsdining, which is incredibly unique to the city. Basically, the people generally seem to care more about what you think and about what your experience was overall.   Now to Oyster Bar. According to Eater, when this place was established in Palace Station 20+ years ago, it was inspired by New York City's Grand Central Station Oyster Bar. I've been to that Oyster Bar, and let me tell you -- the inspired Las Vegas version is a million times better.   I've been here twice with Amelinda L. and the food is incredible. No doubt about it. The pan roast gods have always smiled upon us because the wait to get seated can be up to 3-4 hours. The two times we went were around 10-11am after the Christmas holiday before New Year's, and we were able to get in within 30 minutes or less.   The bouillabaisse is incredible and so is the pan roast options (any, really). The dishes are rich, although the bouillabaisse is on the lighter side if the two were compared. The broths are incredibly flavorful and rich.   Recently, they made a secret menu item public -- the bouill-roast. As the name tells ya, it contains the ingredients of a bouillabaisse, but with the pan-roast sauce. I sampled Amelinda's today, and it marries the two dishes lovingly. Two thumbs up.   The only downside I can give is attributed by the fact that this place is so small. It only has 18 seats, and so it makes 1) waiting a bitch and 2) the arrangement of parties larger than 2 slightly more complicated. The staff does a decent job managing that though. And the chefs put a lot of care and finesse into what they do. It's truly a treat to watch their work in action and how they churn out delicious meals.   My water glass was constantly full, and it was incredible watching the staff dance around a tiny space, seat people, interact with people, and with each other. You can tell that there's a lot of pride here, and it shows with the way they treat people.   This place is a must for locals and visitors alike.",

The waitresses were so fun and very cool. They smiled the whole time and were fast, clean, professional. We were impressed not only by the service but the way they can handle large crowds. The lineup was long for 12-2am and we waited for about 1hr, but it was worth it. We even took some to go and had it on the plane on the way back (security was almost going to make us throw it out because its considered a liquid). We didnt know what to get so we looked around and asked what everybody was eating and the favourites seemed to be the pan roast and gumbo. I'm sure the other items on the menu are good too. This will be my new spot to come first when I come back to Vegas!",

It's a small bar in the Palace Station that seats about 20 people or a little less. There were two people working their butts off nonstop, so be patient. From what they said, there's always a line no matter what time of day and we watched some diners being rude because of the wait which was definitely uncalled for. But the people took it in stride.   We waited an hour at around 11:30pm which I feel like was peak time since everyone was out and about and gambling. I was hungry and tired. Also a bit annoyed since people were sitting there talking story after they were done paying their bill. You could clearly see people were waiting in line. Just plain rude.   They have specials from 1am-9am:  oysters on the half shell $10 wine glass $5 bud light draft 16oz $3  By the time we sat, we qualified for the specials. The oysters were simple and huge!   So this place has what I like to call comfort food all made from scratch. They have various types of gumbo, pan roasts, pastas, etouffe, bouillabaisse, cioppino and steamed seafood like clams and mussels. But of all things, really you need to try the pan roast.   The pan roast is fresh seafood served with brandy, cream and tomato. It comes with a scoop of rice and they're made in individual pots right before your eyes. They work so fast and make so many at one time, it's amazing.   I got a combo pan roast with shrimp, lobster and crab. I'm glad that there were no shells. You can tell them how spicy you want it. I can't handle spice so I said mild and no spice (like a 1 or 2 on a scale of 10). Well, just to let you know, it was spicy and I needed another scoop of rice and beer to help me. It wasn't unbearable but the spice was there. But I knew it needed to be for the flavor. My boyfriend got the Palace pan roast which had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. He got it at like a 7 and he loved it.   The portion is a pretty good size and two people could share if you're not super hungry. But there's a $5 charge on shared entrees. The combo pan roast was $23.99 which was worth every penny to me. They were so nice that they boxed it up for me to go since I was so full of beer and rice. They boxed it so well and saran wrapped it so it didn't leak. Next time I'll try the bouillabaisse or jambalaya mild. I'm sure it's freaking amazing as well!",

The cook and server were very nice and friendly even though it was just then two working at the place.  I had gotten the half dozen oysters and lobster gumbo(spicy). The oysters were so fresh and juicy I wish I could go back again and have it. The spicy lobster gumbo wasn't too spicy but it was spicy enough to make it good. They put decent amount of lobster in it. Definitely recommend this place if you are ever in Vegas because I know I am  coming back",

Try to avoid long waitline and crowd by coming here during off peak hours which are lunch and dinner hours.  Food Everything here is above par and good but try going with popular house dishes that are mentioned on the menu. Portions are generous and they charge $5 for sharing a plate. During happy hour oysters are so much cheaper by dozen.  Service Even though it's really busy most of the times services are prompt and friendly.  Overall Food they serve here are something you can't recreate at home and something that makes you come back for more at least once every month. I don't regret coming here even though waitline might be long.",

Furthermore make sure to get the lava sauce! The lava sauce is a combination of chopped habanero peppers, crushed red peppers, Serrano chilis, and some sort of tomato base I think with olive oil and wine mixed in it. Honestly, it has such good flavor and good heat to add to your gumbo or pan roast.   Oysters are also good! Basically you won't be disappointed with anything on the menu.  Prices are a little bit on medium to high side, and are somewhat comparable to what you would pay at Cheesecake Factory.   MAKE SURE YOU ARRIVE 1-2 hours before you really want to eat because the line gets outrageous and the wait can be for hours. There's only 18 seats I believe.",

We also got the combo pan roast (a thick cream-based soup) and bouillabaisse (a lighter and spicier broth). They were definitely generous with the seafood in both of these soups. If I had to choose one, I would go with the pan roast.",

I would have given this a 5-star review, but my husband's crab gumbo was too salty, which I've read is a complaint by some other reviewers. We also had half a dozen oysters, and they were fresh and delicious. The only other critique (besides the ridiculous wait- 45mins at noon)  is that I was surprised that the oysters weren't disconnected from their shell.  usually when you're paying a premium for seafood, you expect the oysters to be de-shelled. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and I will go back ( during off-peak hours).",

    "text": "I didn't want to like this place.  Especially one hour into our two-hour wait, I was getting hangry (hungry angry), and I figured this would be like watching Avatar - unable to match the hype. But, I have to say the food is really good and props for the waitresses for keeping a smile.  Pros:  1) Food quality. Despite the hype, the food is good. We got the Alaskan Chowder and the Combo Pan Roast. There are huge chunks of tender lobster, lots of large shrimp, and tender pieces of real clam. Unlike many places where it is mostly soup with a few shreds of seafood, this is chock full of the good stuff. The Alaskan entree is way better than the regular soup items, and the best chowder I've ever had. I also feel that it is the best deal on the menu. The combo pan roast is also good, but costs a few bucks more for similar ingredients. They are also stingy with the rice; now I understand why many people get one pan roast, pay the $5 splitting fee, and get two plates of rice to better match one dish of pan roast sauce.  2) Service.  There's only 1 cook and 2 waitresses. They're working hard and nonstop. They're probably frustrated too. But they found a way to smile and instead of kicking the dog; they were really nice to all customers... enough so that I noticed and was pleasantly surprised. Soda refills were frequent and without needing to ask.   Cons:  1) Obviously the 2-3 hour wait.  Even if you go before you're hungry, the time goes slowly and you get impatient quickly. They seriously need to open a bigger restaurant or additional locations. It's worse in the casino because you're stuck inhaling all the smoke and getting lung cancer just to get your dinner.   2) Small kitchen. There are only 18 seats. Worse, there are only 6 steam pot thingies to cook the food. That means that it takes 3x as long to get through a round of people, which causes the 2-3 hour wait. Note that in between cooking, each pot must be cleaned - which takes as long as cooking.  3) Some of the customers. Things are slow enough, but some people are really inconsiderate which makes the long wait worse. - You had 2 hours in line to decide what you want. Don't look at the menu for the first time after you get seated, making the rest of us hungry for an extra 15 minutes. - This is not a bar. Don't sit there sipping a wine for 30 minutes before you even order your food. Eat and get out so the rest of the hungry people can have a turn. This is Vegas and you can get alcohol anywhere else. - This is not good for big parties. No better way to get mad than to see an empty seat or two (out of only 18) sit there unused for 30-40 minutes because they are trying to seat five people together, or four people done but waiting for the one slow eater in their group. Sit separately or find a friend who eats faster.  I'm glad I went once, but will not go again unless the wait is less than 30 minutes (which is only at 7am I'm told).",

The pan roast and bouillabaisse are awesome as usual with lots of lobsters shrimpers mussels and the soup was to die for! The gumbo was however not my cup of tea, too salty!

Got there at 10:30pm on a Sunday night and waited 2 hours and 20 mins to be seated  there were about 16 people ahead of us. Oyster bar is like a bar top with 18 seats, the food is made to order - super fresh, also probably the reason why it takes so long as well. We got our food at 1:30am... So we waited a total of 3 hours.   Tried the combo panroast ($24.99) and it was delicious! Highly recommend it (if you don't mind the wait). The seafood was fresh, the flavors were amazing, and it was just great comfort food after drinking all weekend. I would eat here again, but I wouldn't want to wait more than 1-1.5 hours for it.",

I forced as much as I could just on pure awesomeness of taste.  Clam Chowder Wow wow wow. I should have just gotten a cup instead of a bowl because I couldn't even finish the Pan Roast.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE oysters. I can easily have 3 dozen and still want more, so of course I had to eat at the Oyster Bar.   My friends and I were only going to be in Vegas for one night and all I wanted to do was eat here since it had been bookmarked for so long. Knowing that the lines are notoriously long, we woke up early to have breakfast here. There was no wait!! Yes!!!   My two girlfriends and I ordered: 1.5 dozen oysters, New England clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder, and a combo pan roast.   Oysters-- remember how much I love oysters? I couldn't eat more than 6 of these. They were seriously the blandest oysters I've ever had. Lemon juice and Tabasco did nothing to the flavor. I've been to plenty of happy hour oyster spots where the oysters were just as cheap but the quality was so much better. I was so disappointed by these oysters :(  Clam chowder-- pretty good. Not the best I've had but definitely tasty. There was plenty of clams so that's always a plus.   Manhattan clam chowder-- my friend ordered this and when it first came out we weren't even sure it was her chowder. It was thicker than a typical Manhattan chowder. Still tasty but definitely not what she was expecting.   Pan roast-- definitely the star of our meal. There's plenty of seafood and the flavor was great!   Overall, the meal was just ok. We all agreed we wouldn't wait in line for this. Everything (aside from the oysters) was good but we've had better elsewhere. And if you're gonna call yourself \"Oyster Bar\" shouldn't your oysters be better than just sub par??",

There are about 8 pots for 18 seats...so the wait time for your meal is pretty long unless you are only ordering oysters. One thing everyone noted is the long wait time which is about 70 minutes at the minimum. The total wait time for a meal at this place is at least 1.5 hours. The food is good, but in my opinion it is not worth such a long wait in a smoky retirement home casino.   I give this place a 4 stars because of the food is good. Definitely try this place If you happen to be in this depressing casino and the line is short....but I would not make a special trip out there. If you are staying on the strip, you will have to take a cab to get there.  Btw, there won't be a cab waiting outside for your return. You will have to get their outside staff to call one out for you.",

DELICIOUS!!! I ordered the Combo Pan Roast at a level 6. It's got just a lil bit of a kick that tickled. Crab crab crab everywhere in the dish! If anything, I needed more rice to match the sauce.

If I'm unlucky enough to have to wait in line, I stare at the digital menu and commit to trying the gumbo, the lobster tail, the etouffee. But once I plop down at the seat, the inevitable happens: Pan Roast it is.   But that's because they're bomb as fuck.  It doesn't matter which one you get--Shrimp, Lobster, Crab or Combo (all 3), they're all absolutely fantastic. I usually get spice level 7 or 8, but that's because I require hot ass food. Spice it how you like, but the FLAVOR is there regardless.  Try your best not to stare at the meager countenances of the hungry, salivating customers in line as you eat who stare back at you with their arms folded, hoping you don't sit there savoring every bite for hours and just eat and get the fuck out already. Similarly, try not to walk around patrons looking them up and down with dirty looks as a \"subtle\" way to rush them.  I find that Sunday mornings I never have to wait. And I like the cook who's usually there. Any other time I go, there's a wait. Longest I've ever waited was an hour.    I say all this to say I will give up my 1st born for a Pan Roast at my disposal. Okay, not the 1st born. But maybe my pet. Okay, my neighbor's pet. It appears to be depressed anyway.",

I have been to a place called the broiler and it doesn't not come close to how good this place.  Food: The lobster pan roast is my favorite. It is a cajun broth type with spices, decent size lobster pieces, red/green peppers. I usually get it at about level 7 for spiciness and comes with a sourdough roll and a scope of rice. It is  a big portion, however, they do charge if you decide to split with someone else. I would recommend just getting your own portion because you will definitely want to take some home and eat it for later, it is just as good if you microwave it for a later meal. I've also had the claim steamers and that is decent.  I've tried the house pan roast but  I don't like crab meat.  Serivce: The line can sometimes get long but this place is now 24/7 so it really depends on when you go. Even if there is 2 people in line ahead of you, it can take about 1hr because it is a bar seating (good thing it is in a casino, so you can wonder around and let someone else wait in line or switch off). The people that work there are funny and entertaining.   You have got to try this place!!!!",

Maybe if it's 30% cheaper and no wait it'd be worth it to go here. The cioppino, oysters, and little neck clams were so subpar and overpriced; I felt robbed.

    "text": "Oyster Bar is heaven. It's the reason I last came to Vegas with the bf. Yes, we went to Vegas primarily to eat at Oyster Bar. There just isn't anything around LA that's comparable.   I LOVE the Shrimp and Lobster Fra Diablo. It's the best. Last time I was a little adventurous and tried the Etoufee, but just wasn't feeling it. It wasn't bad; I just think the Fra Diablo is a tad better. Maybe it's the pasta.   Spiciness level I get is 4. I've had the 6 before and it was a bit too much for my tongue.   Don't go with a big party. It'll be almost impossible to fit more than a party at 4 when the bar only seats like 16-20 at most. Plus, you'll get dirty looks from the other people in line. Seriously. Especially if you're waiting in line and 4 of your buddies join you. (That's what happened with the big party in front of us). People were making comments such as: \"Oh hell no!\" and \"Did they just cut\"?   It was funny.   The longest I've waited would be probably an hour and a half for lunch. I would say go earlier like at 10a or 11a to beat the crowd.  You MIGHT get lucky. Might.",

    "text": "Famous long waiting line in this place.  I've been dine twice in this small bar counter restaurant.   This time I had a half dozen Oyster and pan roasted seafood (level 4 spicy).   I have to say this time, the pan roast was very salty and I needed to have a sour bread to dilute the taste in my mouth on top of a cup of rice.  A gentleman next to me ordered gumbo but same issue I had despite different dish.  He had to stop eating because too salty.    The chef was funny but with a twist.  Sarcastic jokes to customers, sometimes offensive.  It was midnight and he must be tired but that I don't count as an excuse.   As long as he talk to customer can't I expect some pleasant comments? Oyster was good but very pricy.   If you wanna try, ask less salt because you can always add it to your taste.   I'm sure they can make it again but only if you would wait for another 15min for sure.",

The oysters on the half shell were just ok though...surprisingly, I thought they'd be better. Waited about an hour at 1am on a late Wednesday/Thursday morning...and it just so happened they were going to close at 3am due to repairs on the main water line of the hotel so the water would be shut off for about an hour.  Last seating was at 2am...I thought we weren't going to make it in but luckily we did. I also thought there might be a Gangs of New York style riot every time they had to turn someone away while we were eating.  I guess that's how good this place is. Definitely want to come back and try their gumbo. That looked and smelled REALLY good.",

So even though there are open seats, they won't move anyone to accommodate a larger group (5+). We probably could've been seated sooner, but had to wait around until 5 rows consistent seats became available. Ordered the Cioppino and Combo Pan Roast and it was DELICIOUS. Portions were large so we ended up taking it to go and had it as a midnight snack (which might have been better). Only sucky thing is that I asked for an extra scoop of rice for my to-go bag and they charged me $2.99. Boo...",

    "text": "God Dammit Oyster Bar, everyone comes here for the god damn pan roast and for me the clam chowder was better. It's more like 3.5, but I'll round it up to 4 just because your oysters was that damn good.   Literally; its an oyster bar, but everyone raves about your damn pan roast. Is it worth the 2 times both at 2 hour long wait at 3-4am after a long night of clubbing? No! Luckily, I think the chef opened up Ritters in Los Angeles where I can avoid driving 4 hours and waiting 2 hours for the pan roast.   The Pan roast is basically a FATTY ass version of a Manhattan Clam Chowder and add seafood. I'm not a fan of Manhattan clam chowder but I love Clam Chowder and I got to say that Oyster bar has gotten their cream ratio on point. (Literally if you watch the chef cook the pan roast you notice he drops a giant slab of heavy cream into the pot) Which is why people love the Pan Roast so much, because its half fat and people love fat!  What did I like besides their CREAMY ASS clam chowder (Cheaper than pan roast and more flavorful in my opinion) I mean the Clam Chowder is 8.99 and Pan Roast is 23.99.   DUN DUN DUN, THEIR OYSTERS, its a oyster bar and this has to be the best god damn oysters I have had. They are fatty Illinois oysters.   TL:DR YOUVE BEEN WARNED, ITS LIKE A 2 HOUR WAIT.",

    "text": "I've always heard great things about The Oyster Bar but never knew what to expect. So let me tell you.   First of all it's an actual bar that seats about 20-25 people at a time. When we arrived around noon on a Monday there were a few people in line....maybe 3-5 groups of 2 no more than 4 people per group were ahead of us. We literally waited a little over an hour to be seated. That's right because you are waiting for people to order, eat, pay, and leave. Everyone who passed by the line all said the line is terrible but it's worth the wait. Okay...so we stayed encouraged. Don't quit.   What a wonderful feeling it is to be at the front of the line. We are next. Things are moving quickly. And 3 seats for us are finally available!!  As soon as we are seated they put one warm dinner roll in front of you with some butter and take ur drink order. The roll is good but we almost asked for another. So glad we didn't. We ordered 2 of the House Gumbo, a chicken gumbo, half dozen oysters, and a shrimp and crab Caesar salad. When I say the portions are HUGE!!!! They are HUGE!!! Like I needed someone else's appetite to help me finish this. We should've shared EVERYTHING.   So the salad was so good and cold and full of shrimp and crab. Definitely would stand in line for that again. The oysters were so fresh and yummy!!! The gumbo. Sadly I wasn't impressed with the gumbo. I've had better. And I think my whole reason for coming was FOR the gumbo.  But again...the portions are ginormous. You definitely get your money's worth (and time too).   I gave them 4 stars because they need to be able to prepare orders to go for people who don't need to sit at the bar. At this time the only way you can get an order to go is by waiting in line to sit at the bar and order and well if you do all that you might as well sit at the bar and enjoy. Or they could open up more tables somewhere that's associated with their establishment.   Also, again the gumbo wasn't that great for me. But I have friends who love it so maybe just an off day or different chef.   Finally the wait staff was very nice as accommodating.   I'll definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Who would have thought Palace Station would house such a food gem!  Oyster Bar is a 16 seat bar/restaurant inside Palace Station Casino. If you read reviews, you should know, they wait can be crazy. Especially if you have a big party. Be ready for the line to move slow also, they cook to order right in front of you and this is not food you can just scarf down right away.   I got really lucky and came at 10:30 am on a Saturday and it was empty!!!  Service was friendly. They split our groups bill per couple. They do charge a 18% gratuity for large parties.  Combo Pan Roast - $23.99 - Seafood heaven in a bowl. Probably the best seafood dish I have ever had. The tomato cream sauce was one of the most flavorful sauces I have had. Thick and creamy with the taste of the sea from the seafood that it's cooked with. The combo comes with fresh lobster, shrimp, and crab. And you get a ton of seafood too. When you drench the rice with the sauce, it was like biting into heaven. I could not stop my self from eating all of it. The portion is pretty heavy, I was full and sleepy all day.   Alaskan Chowder - $18.99 - Another best for me, best clam chowder I ever had. Thick and rich creamy chowder packed full of shrimp, crab, and lobster. They do not use much potato filler in this chowder. You get a ton of seafood with each bite. Worth every penny.  Rice - $2.99 - They keep asking if we wanted more rice and of course we did. It would have been nice if they told us it costs 3 bucks extra. My only complaint.   Sourdough Bread - Complementary - Dry and stale. I tried to use it to mop up my pan roast sauce but it was not good.  Spice Tip, anything over 5 they just dump more chili flakes into it, so get 5 and just add more flakes if needed.",

The problem is... there are only like 16-18 spots at the counter.  Some days you get lucky, sometimes not.  You also need to be over 21 to eat there (sorry kids!).",

    "text": "Luck of the draw, we walked up to the bar with two seats open just for us. Of course, this was early evening on a weekday. Almost immediately after we sat down, the waiting line started growing and growing. This wasn't just a meal, it was a whole show. Our team for the night was Chris and Eze, who seemed to make the bar work like a well oiled machine. It's mesmerizing watching them prepare the food. Of course, they were super funny too so that adds a star to my experience. Our service was good, but it did take a while for them to prepare the food. Watching the whole process, I can definitely understand why it took a while for our food to be ready.  I also have to note that we co-incidentally sat next to three guys who just got in from Hawaii. We at and talked story the whole time. After my dining partner gave me to them for the evening, they all shared their food with me so I could taste more items on the menu that what we ordered. That's True aloha spirit, which went well with our discussions about our family on the island and how much things have changed in Honolulu over the years.  Okay - back to the food. We ordered the pan roast (heat 7) and clam linguine (heat 7). Sooooooooo good! I only wish we got the dishes more spicy. The depth of flavor was immense. Watching all the ingredients that went into the dish definitely added to my tasting experience. Loaded with seafood (shrimp, crab and lobster), the combo pan roast was rich and creamy. This is definitely not something you could eat all the time, but worth a splurge on your diet. The linguine was a solid dish. I never had it spicy before, but spicy definitely added to the taste experience. I am glad we didn't order  appetizer or salad, because the dishes we  did order were huge servings.  My new friends let me try the oysters - large sized oysters that were not gritty at all. Great with horseradish and tabasco. The alaskan chowder was tasty and loaded with seafood. This dish wasn't spicy, but the addition of shrimp, crab and lobster added more depth of flavor. I could really taste the seafood.   All in all, it was a great experience. I can't wait to go back.... and I hope there isn't a long line next time.",

I've been a few times between 3am - 9am and was able to be seated right away.  It's a little weird to eat this for breakfast, but you get over it real quick.  I love gumbo so that's what I typically get with a spice level between 5 and 8.  Three's not much  else to say that hasn't been said.  If you are a fan of seafood, you MUST try Oyster bar.  The oyster platter is a good deal and they tasted fresh.  Helpful Tip: Especially if you have a large group, they let one person stand in line.  It makes everyone else behind you a bit upset so be prepared for a few evil eyes.",

I guess they are big on customers not cutting, even if parties ahead of them say its ok.  Now onto the food.  Got half a dozen oysters, Alaskan clam chowder and the Palace Pan Roast.  Oysters weren't the greatest I ever had (especially for being called Oyster Bar) but they were huge and weren't bad by any means.  Clam chowder was great, lots of crab with a hearty taste.  Palace Pan Roast was the best by far.  Had shrimp, crab, sausage, chicken- with plenty of it.  It wasnt too creamy or too liquidy.  All of this was split between myself and a friend, definitely way too much food for the two us.  The portions are huge!  Definitely would recommend coming in small parties (3-4 max).",

The bar is next to a variety of slot machines to increase the overall price of your Oyster Bar experience. After we were seated, it was another 10 minutes before someone took our order. We ordered the a dozen oysters, Pan Roast, and Etouffee. After 15 minutes, our food was served.   Thankfully we were able to take advantage of the midnight special where (June 2016) 1/2 dozen oysters are $10. Not bad. We devoured those oysters on the shell in minutes. Tasted fresh, meaty, and no fishy taste whatsoever. So for you oyster snobs, the oysters most likely lived above water. Regardless, very tasty, especially for the price.  The Pan Roast and  Etouffee both tasted similar to me. We ordered level 7 spicy, but unfortunately, the cook forgot to add the chili oil. We were too tired to complain, but still both of those dishes tasted hearty with plenty of seafood essence. Someone seated next to us noticed that we were griping about the lack of spiciness and offered us to try her Etouffee. She ordered level 6. Were we about to taste a complete stranger's food? Of course, it's Vegas. It tasted really good with that extra heat. I recommend ordering the Pan Roast or Etouffee with at least a level 6.  The complementary sourdough bread was dry. You'll need to drench it in butter or dip it in the Pan Roast for it to be edible.  Glad I tried Oyster Bar and it's a must try on your next visit to LV.",

Note: 21 and over only to be seated at the bar. No kids are allowed   Food here is awesome! They make all the food when you order! I personal enjoy food made to order and don't mind waiting.  We had the oyster appetizer and boy was that fresh! It tasted so good! For my main course I had the Palace Pan Roast! I highly recommend any of their Pan Roast you won't be disappointed! If you like it spicy bump it up to about a level 4. You can go higher than 10 if needed.   The service was great since it's so small they are able to always refill my drinks and check on me. The staff is very friendly and they had no problem chatting with us while we wait for our food.",

The shrimp tho ! GET THE SHRIMP, so big and good.  Gumbo was soooo good, and so was the hydrid it was so good I drank the whole sauce,,,, lol like soup .

I believe there are only 18 seats.  We waited about an hour to get seated.  You can see the Chef prepare and cook your food.    ::Food:: First, we got a warm and fresh sourdough bread with butter. My favorite pasta is Linguine with Clams, I wanted to order it so bad but I decided to try their famous Pan Roast that everyone raves about.  I got the Combo Pan Roast which came with shrimp, crab, and lobster. For spicy level, I choose mild; the spicy level option is from 1 to 10.  The portion was more than enough for me.  It also came with a side of white rice.  It was thick, flavored well, and creamy.  The shrimp, lobster, and crab tasted fresh.  My friend got the Bouillabaisse.  It had celery, shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels, and clams.  Both of the dishes were delicious!  I prefer the Bouillabaisse because it's lighter and less filling; I was so full.

It had a good kick, but I could tolerate more. The combination of shrimp, crab, and lobster was amazing. I think it was totally worth the wait and the cost. Lots of flavor and the soup was hot and creamy. Definitely big enough to share, but I wanted my own for the higher spiciness level :P",

    "text": "Slave girl has been dreaming about oyster bar for awhile. We finally left home early enough to get to Vegas in a decent time to eat here.  The parking was no problem, the problem was the wait time. We got there around 2:30pm on a Saturday thinking everyone should be full already from lunch, especially when I only saw about 20 people ahead of us. Ooooh my farting God and their 18 seats only restaurant.... It was 4:30 when we finally got seated. Thank goodness we found 99 cents frozen margarita and free WiFi, but if you were in line by yourself... You better make friends with the people behind you and offer those 99 cents margarita if you want some while waiting.  What we got: combo pan roast, Alaskan chowder, and a dozen of oysters (well, oyster bar, hello?). Pan roast was awesome! Not so sweet and packed with goodies. Oysters tasted OK but lacked the fresh oyster flavor. All I could taste was fresh water and sauces were required for flavoring. A little disappointed. The chowder was the worst of the 3. It was very salty and not editable for us.  When I asked chef Ricardo about the saltiness, he took a taste of the unprocessed chowder base and told me it tasted OK to him. Well, if he had tasted mine, the one that has been concentrated and cooked in a pot, by him, he would have agreed with me. (that means he doesn't taste his food) Then, he told me the chowder base was not made by him so he couldn't speak for the taste... Hmmmm. When I asked him if he could do anything to make my chowder less salty, he said there was nothing he could do. I am no chef, but I know you can probably add water/milk/cream/rice/bread to make the food editable again. Hmmmm...  Would I come back again? Yes, because I like the pan roast a lot, and I still wanted to try their gumbo. But my first time experience here was na na na.",

I also ordered the combo pan roast which has the shrimp, crab, and lobster which was amazing. All priced just right.

This place is a small little bar in an open casino so you'll have to deal with all the smoke and noise. Line is standing only. No sitting... And you can't leave or else someone will take your spot. For two people we waited an hour and a half to get seated!!  I felt like people lingered there forever. But I was starving and was not willing to give up.   Once I was seated I thought... Hallelujah...I'm going to eat!!!  Finally!!!!... I wolfed the bread and butter down, which they serve you immediately. We ordered right away and I looked hungrily at the pots of steaming broth. I waited and waited and waited.. And an hour later my food was ready!  They reason it took so long was because they only have 8 pots to cook with. So even if you're seated you still have to wait for other orders to be cooked before yours.   We ordered the pan roast and the etouffee. Portions were large and it came with a scoop of rice.  The pan roast was delicious!!  It tasted like creamy rich garlicky tomato soup with seafood in it. I loved it!  It has a sweet aftertaste that I really like. The etouffee was very salty!  I had to drink a lot of water and eat a lot of rice with it. My friend and I had to trade because the monotone salty flavor, although good, was really overwhelming after three bites.   Overall I enjoyed my experience. I got to watch the chef cook... Which was really scoop things into the pot, and people watched. The pan roast was sooo good!  Etouffee was ehh... Would not order it again. If you come be prepared to wait. The chef said there is ALWAYS a wait...",

The portions are huge, they charge $5 to split a meal. They always give a complementary piece of bread. Be careful what heat/spicy level you choose, they are very spicy lol I got a 7 and I could barely eat my food and I love spicy. They also have hot sauces available to use so I would suggest not going higher than a 6 on your meal. They have the best oysters I've ever had, so fresh and delicious. My favorite meals are the cioppino and the pan roast. They have great staff and service.",

    "text": "My hubby and I stumbled upon the Oyster Bar with the help of Yelp. We were in Palace Station for bingo but realized it was getting late so hubby suggested we find a place to eat at Palace Station.   So I do what any faithful Yelper would do, I open my application to see what good places are in this place. Low and behold, I see the reviews for the Oyster Bar and look up and realize we're standing in front of it.   It's an unassuming bar inside the casino, out in the open. Or should I say it looks like a bar but is actually a full service restaurant where they cook the entrees in front of you. I didn't initially notice the line of people waiting patiently. So, of course we had to try this place. We waited for close to an hour or more before we eventually got seated.   The reviews don't lie. This place was all types of amazing. We got the combo pan roast, the cocktail shrimp, some drinks. It was all simply amazing.   I asked one of the workers if he thought I could get on the plane in the morning with my leftovers because there was no way I could finish it (portions are huge) and no way I could leave it. He said some people freeze it but for the most part, you can't get through airport security with it.   So I ended up mixing mine with the rice. And sure enough my bag got pulled at security, but they took it out, took a brief look and the TSA agent was like \"man I'm hungry now\". Lol So yes, the rice made it thicker so it wasn't like a soup any longer. But you better believe it was still amazing even when I got it home.   This place was so amazing that when I returned to Vegas a couple of weeks later, I had to take my bestie.   Now the second trip to Oyster Bar there was a little drama involved because they're open 24x7 and of course me and my bestie end up there on the one day in the month when they close for 8 hours to do a deep clean. Now the sign said they closed at 1am but they were kicking folks out of the line at 12am. I had an issue with this, #1 because we were some of the folks they kicked out the line and #2 because I knew I wasn't paying to take the ride back out to that side of Vegas.   Sooo to make a long story short, I contacted mgmt and they were accommodating and seated us, as there was still a load of folks still being served. And yes, it was still amazing. I highly recommend them. I would give this place a 5+ stars if I could.",

    "text": "Even though I had to wait almost 3 hours, it was well worth it! This place is amazing!  I got here about 2:00am and got seated close to 5:00am. This was on a Friday night so I was expecting the worse. I did however get to meet some very cool people and most were first timers just as I was. I ordered the combo pan roast with a spice level of 7 and all I can say is WOW! The flavor is so unique and original. I've never had anything like this before so I now consider myself a pan roast fanatic lol. The staff was great and they were very kind, interactive and told us the best time to come and avoid a long wait (Between 5am-8am). A person I met in line was even kind enough to offer some of their gumbo to me since they were a regular. It was just as good as the pan roast but with a bolder flavor. I totally recommend this to anyone. Now that I am a resident of Las Vegas this will definitely be apart of my life regularly.",

Oyster Bar is definitely the ONLY reason I would ever venture out to Palace Station again.  Soo is it good enough to look past the two hour long wait, second hand smoke, and horrible reception?? Yes...yes it is.  The service is friendly and the portions are huge and delicious.  After starving in line, you really do start ordering with your eyes.  We ordered two dozen oysters, clam chowder, and the combo pan roast. Everything tasted so fresh and filling!  The oysters were soo fat, clam chowder was creamy, and the combo pan roast was very flavorful.  There is not a huge selection on their menu, but what they do have is all they need.  I will definitely be back here!  OYSTER BAR- PLEASE EXPAND ... OR EVEN BETTER, MAKE YOUR WAY OVER TO LA!! :D",

    "text": "Located off the strip, on the other side of the 15 freeway is the Palace Station Hotel. I have never set foot in this hotel/casino in my life until my friend told me that I need to go try the Oyster Bar here. Although, I'm not a big fan of raw oysters because of what it can potentially do to my bowels, I was assured that they have plenty of other (sea)food items to choose from.  The Oyster Bar is literally a horse shoe style bar (think shabu shabu). No frills, no tables, just a bar and stools. Everything is made, prepped, and served right in front of you. Because of this, be prepared to wait. It's worth it, trust me! Although we only had about eight people in front of us, it still took about an hour to get seated. Also, if you roll deep, expect to split up. This place though is opened 24/7. Maybe if you creep in around 4am then the line will be short unless all the drunken clubbers and strippers are present.  It seems like everyone has mixed reviews about the different food items here. Personally, the House Gumbo ($20) is the Royal Flush in my opinion. It's big enough for two people. The flavor will blow the socks off your feet. I had a New Orleans native with me and even she was impressed. I would come back and wait the long @$$ line just for this. I've been fantasizing about this gumbo ever since.  The jambalaya was my next favorite item we shared. It was a little bit runny at first but as the rice sits, it'll slowly soaks up the sauce. Another flavorful delight and massive in size.  The Seafood Pan Roast was good but it doesn't trump the other two items I sampled. It's heavily raved about, but I can go back to the Oyster Bar and pass it up.  I like how each of these items was made right in front of us in these cool looking, silver/metal gadgets. It's hard to explain what they are so just check out the pictures or go there yourself and pay attention to how your food is being made. You'll be fascinated at how easy the chefs will make it look. Their secret is in the pre-made sauces of course. Our chef Blake was calm and collective even though he had a lot on his plate. Patrons were eagerly gawking at each dish he made, impatiently waiting their bite.  Few suggestions: try not to come during peaked times. Share dishes and be aware that the portions are huge. Also, keep the party to a minimum unless you don't mind splitting up. Lastly, bring your appetite and taste buds because like watching Seigfreid and Roy, you're about to get mesmerized.",

    "text": "\"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today.\"  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys.  \"OK, OK, where we going?\"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining.  \"Oyster Bar.  Palace Station.\" is all he says.  \"Cool\".  Leaning towards my buds, \"Did we really feed him fish sperm?\"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.  Very Important:  1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait. 2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.  That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.  Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.  Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.  Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.  The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)",

The wait is long so do yourself a favor and get there really early or really late, there's only 24 seats. My only issue here is they seem understaffed at peak hours. Seat were often available but we waiting to long to be cleaned. A lot of time wasted. This made for a slow turn around time and was very frustrating while waiting in line.",

    "text": "So glad I got to try this place!  Originally tried to go Saturday at 2pm...big mistake. There was a line of about 15 people, the group in front of us had 7 people in it, and after 45 minutes and no movement in the line, we gave up and went somewhere else.   We were leaving Vegas early on Sunday, like 7:30am and decided to try again. This time there was only one couple sitting at the bar, but by 8:30am when we were done eating, the bar was almost full again! So yes, it gets busy! I would only recommend going between the hours of 4am to probably 9am on weekend if you don't want to wait lol or on a weekday in the middle of the day. There is no way of calling ahead and checking the wait time, you just have to go and check (trust me, I tried calling the hotel).   Now for the food!  They have something called the midnight special from i think 3am-9am where certain items and drinks are discounted so we got the 1/2 dozen oysters to start. Fresh and served with lemon, cocktail sauce and horseradish, we were totally satisfied.   We ordered the combo pan roast and alaskan chowder. Pan roast was delicious and had plenty of crab, shrimp, and lobster! But they use a lot of cream so its really heavy, especially because we were having it for breakfast. I kind of felt sick after, like that feeling you get when you eat something delicious thats terrible for your body lol. Despite the color, it was not too tomatoey which I liked. Also, they only give you one scoop of rice, which is not nearly enough for the big bowl of pan roast you get.   The chowder was delicious too and not as heavy as the pan roast surprisingly. It also had plenty of shrimp, crab, and lobster but dare I say it was a little bland...Maybe needed more salt. I still enjoyed it because you could really taste the seafood and it wasn't fishy. Maybe some black pepper and dipping the sourdough bread they give you in it would have done the trick. But I would still order it again.   The presentation was awesome too, check out my pics. I would totally go back and try more items! But only during non crowded times!",

The reason I gave it a four stars was because the wait was so damn long that by the time we got our food I wasn't that hungry at all. We order the half dozen oyster. my husband got the mix seafood gumbo and I got their house special seafood pan roast. Just remember if they ask you which level of spiciness don't get anything below 5 because my husband order his level 4 and mine was level 3 and believed me, it was not anything close to spicy. no wonder we were surprise when we heard other ppl order theirs level 7 or 10. we thought they were crazy for doing that, but I guess I know why now. overall the oyster was really fresh and good and the pan roast was just ok. I mean after few spoon I felt like it was just too salty for my taste bud.",

    "text": "My friends and I made the trek over to Palace Station just for this famed Oyster Bar. I don't see why else we would be here since the casino was really old & had a mature crowd.   The first thing to point out is the wait. You will wait a good while since its just a counter. What you see is what you get with this place and there is no hidden extra seating area. It's simply just a counter and right next to it is a small roped off section for people to wait. & stare at you while you eat of course because the food is so good and they have been waiting that long haha. There's only a few people working this oyster bar but every one of them was really friendly.   I tried the Pan Roast Combo (21.99) with a spicy level of 6. I like spicy food so it didn't seem spicy at all, just a kick of flavor. It comes with rice and dinner rolls for dipping. Portion was really big so easily feeds two people (there is a split fee of $5 bucks tho!)  I've never had a pan roast before but it was so good and so flavorful. Hard to describe but its like a thick seafood stew? I am probably butchering the description so I will stop there, but it IS worth coming out of your way to Palace Station just to try this. In fact, I'll probably go out of my way to come back to this place again.",

It is de-li-ci-o-so enough to endure waiting in long line to be seated at a less than 20 person-seats by a seafood bar, at a casino off the strip, surrounded by gamblers nearby . . .  Not sounding attractive? So I thought too, when my parents first took us here years ago-  But it's definitely worth it!!! Because this place is not only unique but their food taste unbelievable!!! (as you can see from amazing Yelp reviews)  Honestly, it was always good; no doubt about that But this time around, it was extra special, extra yummy!  . . . so good that we almost went back for seconds before we ended our trip (which doesn't happen often because i am not too big on repeating restaurants)  So! as written on the website,  \"authentic and delicious flavors described as a \"cross between san francisco & new orleans\" the las vegas oyster bar at palace station features live-action cooking and may just be the best kept secret in town...but not for long order up little neck clams steamed to perfection or mussels from the deep blue sea try a bowl of new england clam chowder or cioppino, or get a gumbo, pasta dish or the best oysters in las vegas right while siting at the bar the freshest oyster bar in las vegas is first come, first serve, and always worth the wait\"  We started out with some fresh appetizer, which they crack open on the spot the whole procedure is pretty interesting to watch & it was funny when they told us \"it took us much longer to open few oysters than for you guys to finish eating!\" As you can tell from their name oyster bar, their oysters are SUPER fresh, SUPER tasty (even my sister who's not too fond of seafood approves) But if you are not too big on oysters like me (although theirs is definite must), try their fresh clams on the shell because ohhhhhh boy, these were delish!  Their main entrees are cooked individually in their special-looking pot by \"steam\" the chef individually prepares all the dishes so to be honest, your dish pretty much depends on which chef prepares it! According to my parents who come here at least twice a year, our chef that night came back after leaving due to sickness, so we were in for a treat!  and surely . . .some amazing food we had coming that night :D   The dish we always order, the bouillabaisse, which is classic french stew with onions, celery, shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels and clams where you can adjust the \"heat\" leavel . . . I get about 4~5 (regular) & it's perfect for me & as you can see from photos I posted,  you get BIG chunks of seafood in your stew which you can enjoy with the side of rice that comes with the stew.  Their seafood jambalaya is also EXCELLENT!!! Made with shrimp, crab, lobster, andouille sausage, mussels & clams is similar to my parents' favorite bouillabaisse , but it had more flavors . . .yumm!!!  Honestly, i  personally prefer not too many people knowing about this spot, so that I don't have to wait as long when i am there (as the line is already too long) but i decided to share it with you all, so hope you enjoy next time you are in las vegas!I am actually tempted to drive 4hrs+ to las vegas because i am craving this! *wink*",

I ordered the House Gumbo with a spice level of 5 or 6 (can't remember) and it wasn't super spicy, it was soooooo good and the fact that they make it in front of you is even better. This will now be on my list of places I must eat at every time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Waited an hour Saturday morning around 3am. There are only two workers. The guy that makes the food and the other guy who cleans, takes order and etc. When people started leaving around 4am, the worker didn't clean the seats immediately. I think he waited 15 minutes before he started cleaning. We ordered the seafood pan roast and dozen oysters. The pan roast was just ok. My mouth was burning from the temperature. Nothing special I couldn't get back home. The oyster was too big and creamy. Couldn't even finish it. People around us seemed to be enjoying it but this wasn't for me. Honestly, I don't have time waiting in Vegas when I could be gambling, partying or sleeping. I'm glad I tried it and got it off my bucket list, but I won't be coming back.",

They are their busiest, it seems, from 11am and on.  They are open 24 hours and I've heard from a few people they only waited 20 min. That's probably rare.  But it's totally worth it!  Another thing to note, you can not bring your kids to the bar. So don't stand in line for 2 hours to be told that.  Also...if you'd like a to-go order. You still have to wait in line to order.  That's just how it goes. Everything I've ever eaten is delicious. My favorite remains the house gumbo.",

It was plenty of food, and really too much for one person, but be warned that they charge $5 for splitting entrees.  I'm assuming that it means that you order only one thing between two people.  My girlfriend ordered a bowl of clam chowder, and it was chock for of clams.  Very delicious as well.  The service is very friendly and welcoming, but it can be a little slow when it gets busier.    They served the pan roast with a big scoop of rice, which I really loved, but I noticed that another person had pasta.  I'm not sure if that's a choice. It was a great meal.",

    "text": "This place is open 24 hours and there is always a wait, that's how good it is. I have Rtitter's back home with the steam kettle cooking method too but it's just not as good as Oyster Bar. Part of the wait is due to the fact that there isn't many seats and they're understaffed. I feel for these employees they work their butts off. Although they're probably tired the service is not affected. I think they should have atleast one more person working the shift and possibly expanding. The first time I went it was a 2 hour wait just to be  seated and there was about 14 people ahead of me. The second time there was 5 people ahead of me and luckily I got seated after 20 minute wait but the food didn't come until an hour later. I go pretty late at night too. I recommend the pan roast spicy level 9 if you can handle the heat, by the way I'm normally a 7 spice level at other places. This still tastes good the next day when the rice breaks up it adds texture. It goes well with pasta too. The shrimp and lobster fra diablo is delicious too. The difference with the pan roast is that it has brandy and cream. If you're ok with eating raw seafood give the clams on the half shell a try. It's chewy and doesn't have the smelly salt water taste. The New England clam chowder was meh. The portions are big but there is a $5 split charge, kinda steep in my opinion. Screw it just order to and eat the leftovers tomorrow. If you're lucky and have  a microwave in your hotel room. Or get creative and heat it up with a blow dryer. You can also chill it in an ice bucket or sink and bring it back home. They have moonlight specials 1am-9am 16oz bud light draft for $2, bloody mary for $3.50, half a dozen oysters on the half shell for $9, you save $3.",

Mmmmh, not in the mood for it.  Earl's? Not againnn.  So we started yelping for oysters since I've heard of some pretty bomb oyster places in LV and came upon this place.  What the hell is a pan roast? Tomato based with seafood?!  We are so there.  We got there and waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  That is the only bad part about this place--too little seats, too high in demand.  It is not an eat and run type of place, if you don't have about an hour or two--this isn't the place for you.  We ordered the pan roast level 6---and a year later, we still come here for pan roast when we're in town.  We've gotten most of our family and friends addicted to this place too.  I don't suggest coming during peak times if you have a big party, AND if you do have a big party--expect to wait.  We came here once with 6 friends and waited more than an hour just so we can have seats next to each other.  The food is cooked in front of you and service can be a tad slow Side note--you can't call in for to-go orders.  Even if you want to take it to-go you have to go there and wait in line (yes I've tried.)",

My friends took me here and seriously didn't think it could possibly be that great, it's a bar that seats probaly less than 20 people at a time and people still wait at the red ropes hoping to be seated.  We just stand there and stare at the while they eat.  The food was AMAZING... I haven't gone back and it's been months and I still dream about it.  Pan roast and clam chowder, share with someone because it's huge.  We took the leftovers back to the hotel and I actually tried to hide it in the fridge so no one else eats it.  DROOLINGGGGGG...",

The funny thing is we originally came here for the oysters which are good but we now come for the pan roast which is outstanding. I can't emphasize enough how much I love this dish. It is a creamy tomato based stew. I get the combo which includes shrimp, crab and lobster. It is also served with rice which adds to the hardiness of the meal. I like spicy and a level 6 was plenty for me. This meal is delicious, filling and so comforting. I've never had anything quite like the Pan Roast and it keeps me coming back. There are a very limited number of seats and often a wait but ad you can tell, I think it's totally worth it.",

The oysters on the half shell were so fresh and cold. The shrimp was cold and crisp.  And then the best part was the gumbo.  I ate it so fast and then slow to savor everything because the line is so damn long.  Even at 4am!!  At least I had some time to play some blackjack to pay for our meal.   We come here every time we are in Vegas!  Best place to eat in Vegas!",

We had only about six people in front of us so we thought we'd get in at 15 or so mins. Boy was my optimism sorely wrong. But stick with it and you'll be rewarded!  When we finally got to sit down at this dozen still bar, we were ready to eat. Each pan roast/dish is made in its own separate pot contraption linked to a gas source. We did see the main chef clean off the below and the pots themselves which I wondered about because lots of them boil over.  The combo pan roast with perfectly cooked white rice (hey! I'm Asian, its important to us) had shrimp, crab and lobster. How can u describe the creamy tomatoey seafood goodness that explodes in your mouth? Part of it is the wait but the majority is the taste! One bite and my cousin and I could not be more pleased. Afterwards we talked about the deliciousness for a long time.  We share the pan roast which normally has a $5 share price but we also got a dozen oysters on a half shelf which the waitress/hostess explained would negate the share price. The oysters were ok. The chef is a character but in a good entertaining surely way. And the waitress is awesome!  I would go back in a heartbeat and I know I will have dreams of this pan roast!",

    "text": "Finally!  A chance to try their awesome cuisine.  Chef Ricardo is a busy man I tell you.  Theres only a handful of spots to sit while he makes your orders so prepare to wait in line.  We waited for about an hour and a half to get 4 seats.  Man were we hungry. I ordered the Pan Roast Combo which had crabs, shrimp and lobster.  The method of cooking is quite unique.  They use kettle bells that pumps steam through the pipes which heats your food.  My tomato base sauce was out of this world.  It was rich, creamy and had full flavors coming through.  While most people ordered extra scope of rice, I find the bread more appealing to the taste since it added a nice crunch to it.  I've ordered the gumbo before which is also good.  If you have a group of friends, order separate ones so that you can family style it and try all the different flavors this place has to offer.  How I learned about this place is by Chef Ritters, owner of Ritters Kettle in OC.  Since I've tried both, I have a hard time distinguishing the difference of the two.  While some proclaim that the original one is the best, if the recipe is the same and the method to execute it is also the same, then it would just come down to the fresh ingredients.  While being closer to the water, you would imagine that this dish would be better due to the fresher ingredients.  Nope, they are quite identical which is amazing.  Friends, I urge you to make time and grab a seat here.  Its a guaranteed win and thats rare in vegas. :)",

The servers were very nice. Everything was pretty quick with our appetizers but watching the main course being made... I almost didn't eat it. But it cost so much and we waited so long I figured I should suck it up. The cook (EZ) was not a clean individual. He wiped his hands on his apron A LOT. Unlike the servers, he didn't use gloves when handling the food. It was disgusting. Is this the standard? Are people okay with this? Because I'm not. I couldn't finish my meal. This guy wouldn't stop touching stuff with his bare hands! And that apron! While this was going on(I was just focused on my food), my friend witnessed interactions between him and the other patrons next to us. This cook named \"EZ\", very obviously favored and prioritized non-colored patrons. He made facial expressions and negative gestures towards the POC at the bar. Served white people first and practically went in order of the shade of people's skin! This guy is a racist and he's a dirty cook to boot. The way he was acting. SO OBVIOUS. Never going back there. Vegas is a very diverse city. How is this guy getting away with it?! My friend and I are very disappointed. EDIT: Reading past reviews, I have now seen that this isn't the first time racist dirty cooks have done this. Wish I would of read these before this happened.",

As many others said, there are few seats at the bar, so if you have a big party, expect a longer wait.  Luckily, there were only two of us, so we were able to squeeze in between parties.  We also went during a time where it was a happy hour, which included cheaper wines, beer, and raw oysters! We ordered a dozen raw oysters, which were delicious and fresh.  We ordered the bouillabaisse and the pan roast, and the bouillabaisse was amazingggggg. Contrary to what others say, I thought the pan roast (by far the most popular dish ordered) was just okay to me. But it's probably because I really enjoyed the fresh seafood and lighter flavors of the bouillabaisse (although by lighter, there was still a lot of butter put into the soup).   I thought the service was really good, and the chef is amazing.  With so few seats all around the bar, you got to watch him make your food, so it was a fun experience!",

    "text": "WOW.  This is my new favorite clam chowder place. My brother had been talking about this oyster bar place in Vegas for a while. We're in Vegas pretty often so I'm pretty amazed I didn't discover this Oyster Bar sooner. Located in Palace Station Casino you take the 15 North (or was it south..) and exit Sahara make a left. Lines here take forever. That's because it's literally a bar with 15 seats (I counted). They don't add more. Anyway the wait will take you about an hour and something even though there's a line that doesn't look like a lot of people (but considering there's only so many seats.)  So the chef makes the food right there in front of you.   I definitely recommend the white Alaskan Clam Chowder and the Raw Clams.  Raw Oysters i've had better... go for the clams.  Alaskan Clam Chowder White should add lobster, okra, and maybe rice if its leaning towards the salty side.  Also tried the red Pan Roast. I liked the chowder more, this was a little sweeter. Still good though.  You can order bowl of pasta/ rice on the side and eat it with your roast/chowder.   It's a huge bowl of food. If you share they will charge you.   The chef makes it right there in front of you while you're sitting at the bar. Food comes pretty fast. And it's definitely worth the wait. We came here twice in one weekend. The weekend night had a line, the morning during the week at about 10 AM no line. Sweeet.   Gambling at the casino is pretty fun too. Liked blackjack.  Coming back here every time I'm in Vegas.  MmmMmM Clam Chowder.",

We didn't know what to order and was looking around and a nice gentleman offered some suggestions.  He said to go with the Pan Roast for sure and we also ordered the gumbo.  Spice level = 5.  Pretty spicy, but amazing.  Everyone's favorite was the Pan Roast, but I thought the gumbo was pretty good too.  Just a warning, there's okra in the gumbo, so if you don't like okra, don't get the gumbo.  I'll be back to try the ettouffe next time.  We valeted at the Palace Station, where the Oyster Bar is located at.  Free parking ya'll!! Just tip your friendly valet.  We were in and out in less than an hour.

    "text": "I was SO hungry and SO excited to try the infamous Oyster Bar located in Palace Station. The wait was extremely long because this place literally IS a bar. There were only around 16-18 seats. I think we waited 45 minutes to be seated.  There was only one chef and one waitress. The place only had six steam kettles, so you can pretty much know when you're going to get your order. We ordered a dozen oysters, a dozen clams, and the combo pan roast which has different kinds of seafood in it. The oysters took forever because there was only one chef.... so basically he handles the chucking of oysters and clams, as well as cook your entree. The waitress seems really busy as well because she handles the clean up, drinks, checks, and appetizers coming out of the back kitchen.   The oysters were plump and juicy which was a plus. They have oysters for $1 from 1 AM to 9 AM as well. The clams I didn't like so much. They tasted old and had that strong ocean taste; I've had better clams elsewhere. The pan roast took forever but when it was finally ready I wasn't that hungry anymore. The sauce has more of a tomato flavor and was bright orange compared to Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking in Costa Mesa, California. I did like the fact that Oyster Bar has more crab meat in their pan roast.   I would definitely come back to try the Alaskan Clam Chowder though. I can't help but compare this place to Ritter's, but I like how Ritter's pan roast isn't as tomato flavored, has more lobster pieces, and there is no wait. My BF likes Oyster Bar better though, so it really depends on your taste and experience.",

    "text": "A friend and I ventured off the strip for this restaurant she'd heard about. Curiously, it was just a little operation inside the old-school Palace Station casino. Although it was past 1am on Monday morning, the 15 or so prized counter seats were eyed greedily by those in the sluggish queue. The sloth and chattiness of those already eating did  not auger well for us as we settled into file.  There was a local ahead of us; she gossiped about this legendary meal which apparently had eluded--yet beguiled--her and many of her friends. Her anticipation justified the restaurant's 'no sitting' policy for hopefuls, and we would observe that the wait for service was still going strong when we finished our meal an hour (?) later.  Once seated, we each perused the menu, but opted for one of the star 'combo' dishes, which pan-fried seafood in a tomato sauce. We then proceeded to wait--and wait. This is absolutely not a knock on the staff. Just THREE men ran this place.   The Maitre D recorded and served the orders, bussed the dishes, and cashiered. Chef Derrick Brown was a whirlwind of activity. With the oyster shucking, sink, and grills and pots in full view of the customers, it was clear that his workstation was designed so that no motion was wasted. And I shan't forget 'the other guy'; a kid who dipped in and out of the meager backroom, doubtless contributing just as much.  And--as hungry as we were--we were fascinated by the evident care (and time) involved in cooking our meal. It was a treat watching Mr. Brown scrape the first ingredient (butter) into the row of six roasting pot/pans. Then he added a unique mix of proteins and spice level to each. When the tomato cream was finally added, a rich color oozed to the liquid's surface. We knew then that we were about to eat!  I got the 'palace combo', with shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage. An amazing dish (!), to the point where it was almost overkill. Let me explain. First of all, the portion size is some kind of Vegas illusion: we'd debated and abandoned sharing a single bowl. But our meals seemed bottomless, and now we understood why previous diners had taken so long. So all else aside, the combos are a great value.   Secondly, the amount of meat and/or fish you get is ABSURD. It didn't seem like much while cooking, but another magic trick right there. The shrimp were huge, although we both agreed that they weren't extraordinary otherwise. We'd recommend the lobster, crab, andouille sausage, and shrimp (in that order).   My friend was perfectly happy with heat level 4, but I wished I'd gone a notch lower. I didn't want anything getting between me and that delicious tomato broth, that I wished to slurp on forever. To sum up, don't shirk from the caveats in my review. YOU MUST TASTE THIS DISH. The wonderful flavor will simply exhaust you.",

    "text": "A must visit when we are in Vegas. The pan roast is our all time go to. Today I decided to try something different. I usually go with #7 heat level. It's just spicy enough that you can still enjoy your food. Since the first time coming here- I only come between 6am-8am now. There's usually no wait at this time. Any other time, be prepared to wait a long time. The bar only seats about 15 and it's first come first serve. Make sure everyone in your party is 21 and over or looks it. There's an obvious sign that reads you have to be 21 to sit at the bar. They asked for ID from us once. Haven't been disappointed yet here. Love the food and the staff is fun to talk with.",

    "text": "First time I came here a couple of months ago, the line was too long. Tried again last week and stood in line for about an hour and 15 mins or so? Only 6 couples ahead but not a lot of space at the Oyster Bar. Was it worth the wait? YES!  Started with an oyster shot of vodka and half a dozen oysters. I could've definitely used more of the oysters but it was just my wife and I and I can only have so many since she's pregnant. Fresh oysters and huge! Great thing was that the chef doesn't give you any crappy oysters. I saw him throw some bad ones away a few times so this place is legit for providing you fresh and edible oysters.  Also had a bowl of clam chowder and our main dish being the cioppino and pan roast. Plenty of seafood in both dishes and while the level 7 was probably too spicy for the cioppino, it was perfect for the pan roast. Great service and great food. One of the best pan roasts I ever had. Definitely worth coming again if you're in Vegas.",

But it is worth it!!   I had the Combo Pan Roast and my cousin had the Bouillabaisse.  Delicious!!! The soups are ordered with a degree of spicy that is rated from 1-10 10 being throat burning, no amount of ice cream will take it down a notch!  I would suggest 3-5 if you want to taste and enjoy the plate!  You can always make it hotter with the table sauces.  Once we were seated at the bar, we were talking to the other guest and had a great time!  I hear all Station Casinos have the Ouster Bar so I'm gonna make sure I give them all a shot!   Great food!  Great service!  What more can you ask for!",

Seafood combo 2nd time was better and they throw in a big scoop of steamed rice which will get you a big hug from this Hawaii boy.  Still giving them a four because of the wait which I think could be lessened with more help behind the counter.   I'm back home now and was just strickened with the most intense Pan Roast craving the other day.  I would have driven anywhere on the island for one. Lucky I don't live in Cali. I got it bad!",

My boyfriend and I ordered a few things from the menu to share...but the best dish was the palace pan roast...it was so GOOD!!!  Absolutely loved it. Lobster, crab, chicken and sausage were what was in the pan roast, yummy!!! You can order the spiciness of the pan roast on a scale of 1-10. We ordered a six and it wasnt too spicy at all. So the next time we go back I think we will move up the spiciness scale to 7 or 8.    We also ordered the clam chowder. The clam chowder was delicious. It definitley was one good bowl of clam chowder.  The oysters were also delicious and there were all kinds of sauces for it. Beers were inexpensive too. If you ordered the 24 or 50 oz you can keep the glass and next time you bring the glass back to any restaurant at Palace Station you get half off for a refill.   The reason why I docked off a star was the place is pretty tiny so  there will always be a wait everytime you come. We waited a little over an hour to get seated but the line definitely got longer after we came.   The staff was great. The chef was funny and joked around with us a lot. The only thing is that the place only had the chef and a waitress working so at times it took a while to get to us or clean out the empty seats. Overall it was worth the wait and I definitely will become a repeat customer.",

The bowl is huge and easily sharable, but I would rather eat the whole thing to myself. The seafood platter is pretty decent, but I can do without it. Nothing spectacular even though it is an \"oyster bar\".   The bar probably has less than twenty seats so good chance you will have to wait 1+ hour for dinner. It is most definitely worth the wait, but it's quite painful when you're hungry.   Make sure to order ASAP b/c they can only make so many bowls at a time. Don't let people who get seated after you order first. You will regret it if they take the last cooking pot and you have to wait till the next round.  The servers are attentive and move relatively fast. They  were very sweet and even gave us  cheesecake on the house. I guess it never hurts to ask.  Good job MD!

The only problem is there are only 18 seats and with everything on the menu being so delicious, patrons probably stay longer than they first planned.  I know we did.

I thought the people at the bar were taking their precious time to eat but the service was slow. After like 20-25 minutes we finally got seated.   We ordered a dozen oysters which took 20 minutes to get served to us bc the the waiter didn't know how to shuck oysters and he was actually complaining in front of us. Another guy took over bc the other dude was acting fussy and this guy was no better. He acted like opening oysters was the worst job on earth. HELLO you work at a Oyster Bar so get your act together or get some more training on Oyster shucking. Everything on the menu looked really good but with their slow service I don't know if the wait is worth it. Most of the dishes were priced $17-$24 dollars if I could remember. Clam chowders are pretty good here and they cost cheaper on the menu.",

I reallllly wanted a glass of Prosecco or Champagne. They listed about 5 different kinds. When I ordered what I wanted, our waiter said, \"No, no, I give your something else\". So he brought me a tasting of some REALLY sweet, cheap tasting sparkling crap. I told him that I wasn't interested in something sweet, but he seemed to not understand. I ended up ordering a beer, and feeling incredibly awkward.  We ordered the dozen oysters, and the fried calamari. The oysters were ok, not great. We had better ones at Bouchon and Craftsteak. The calamari was atrocious. It was doughy, as though the breading didn't fry. It was inedible. Since we were having such issues communicating with our waiter, we just left it and tried to get out of there as soon as possible.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "We discovered this place by accident.  We were walking around the Palace Station and could not ignore the smells coming from this tiny bar.  Customers had heaping bowls of what could only be yummy goodness in front of them, AND there was a line for this place.  We stood by and watched the cooks at work and took a look at the posted menu - pan roasts, gumbos, etouffes, oysters on the half shell, just lots of good stuff.  I had to ask those who were eating and those in line what to get  - and everyone was saying different things - but it all sounded wonderful!  We were sold!  The following week, we made our first attempt to chow at the Oyster Bar and you can imagine the defeated look on The Husband's face when it had 'just' closed for the evening.  Darn!  The next time we went early and on a weekday.  We didn't want to stand in line and we didn't want to get the stare down!  Haha!  With three of us, we figure we could all share.  So this is what we got:  * Palace Pan Roast \"Served with steamed white rice.\" ($21.99) - This was my absolute favorite of the bunch.  It had the most flavor and I found myself hogging on this dish.  Customers weren't kidding when they said I had to get the pan roast!  * House Gumbo \"A tasty Creole chowder made with seafood, gumbo file, okra, and Andouille sausage.  Served with white rice.\"  ($19.49) - The gumbo was pretty good too, and chunky.  But I just craving the flavors of the pan roast more.   * Etouffee \" Shrimp, crab, and lobster with seasonings in this classic French Creole stew.\" ($17.99) - Their etouffe was good as well, but compared to the others, the pan roast and gumbo ranked higher.  All in all, it was all good, hearty and fatty goodness!  Yes, they do arrive in large pho bowls (large for Vegas, average size for other places).  I think it's more than generous for one person.  We technically didn't have any leftovers because between the three of us, we picked out all the good bits and stuffed ourselves silly.  Come with an appetite!  Prices may seem steep, but when you see how much you get, it's okay.  And the cool part is watching your meal cooked right in front of you!   Service was a bit slower with only two people working.  (They had three the previous weekends we passed by.)  It was okay though because we didn't have to wait and we sat far enough down the bar to not have to acknowledge those in line still.  While you wait, they serve up warm sourdough bread and butter. I was starving and gobbled up two pieces before my order arrived.",

Plus you waited that dang 2 hours, so just get your own.",

This doesn't effect the rating of this place but it def has a bad effect for it. Came here for the huge raves and reviews about this place; first off this is not a real oyster bar so if your coming here for oysters don't bother; If you only carry one type of oyster you are not an oyster bar. Anyways first things first got 1/2 dozen blue points to start and the combo pan fried and the gumbo. The oysters were horrible; like after my meal throw up all my food horrible (which i did). The combo pan fried though is where it's at; great flavor, good amount of spice. The flavors mixed well without overpowering one another; good amount of crab and shrimp def a must when dinning here. Now the pan fried is good but not worth waiting 2 hours for. The gumbo is good too but still nothing special. Overall the hype and rave of this place didn't meet expectations but I will have to come back and try more stuff but i will say it's a cool spot to get your filling if your in the mood for good ol hardy creole cooking because well there isn't many places cooking creole style food and thats what really gave this place the edge for an A-OK, but def not the hype all these yelpers are raving about.",

People behind us waited nearly 3 hours to finally eat.  I understand that there's only 16 seats. But only staffing 1 cook and 1 server slows everything down that much more.  If this was any other restaurant, I would have walked out. I only stayed because I had family from out of town who wanted to try this place.  Save your time and find another place to eat. The Sunset Station has a similar restaurant with more seats. And it's probably the same recipes since they're the same chain of casinos. We won't be returning to the Oyster Bar.",

We waited one hour for Sunday lunch and it was well worth the wait!  Started with the New England clam chowder. It was only second best to Splash Cafe in Pismo Beach, but had plenty of clams to satisfy me. Then we had 1/2 dozen oysters that were simple to die for. The way Bob was sucking away was talent in itself. Bob was amazing cooking constantly for the 18 seats at the bar. Brenda was great at meeting everyone's needs! Definately a go-to anytime we're back in Vegas!",

Second once i was able to sit down things started to get much better the rolls that they start you off with were not the best but was good enough to make you at least not get up and walk away from the anger of waiting,  third the cook seemed to be so out of his mind i was scared to even watch him and wait to see what he was doing but i have to say it was funny to a point to watch this person that looked to be drugged out and out of his mind make food.   finally we come to the main course and i have to say it was well worth the wait i got the house gumbo and it was very good i have to say tho that the combo pan roast that my mom ordered was even better and i would recommend going there any time you are in the area i plan on going back next time i have two hours to wait in line because tho the wait may make you want to shoot yourself in the face in the end it is all worth it.   the only reason it does not get 5 stars it because they lack of speed they cleaned at but other then that i can get over the wait for such great food.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. It seemed like a perfect hole in the wall/hidden gem kind of place. However, after a 2.5 hour lunch, I left Oyster Bar feeling just meh.  I went on a Tuesday around 1PM. There were maybe 7 people ahead of my party of two, and we ended up waiting an hour to be seated. Once seated, it took another full hour for our food to be prepared. We ordered a dozen oysters and the combo pan roast. Their oysters are pretty cheap - $17 for a dozen, but they aren't chucked super well (parts of the oyster still remained on the shell), and they also seem very dirty presentation wise. Honestly, I have to say some of them looked almost gross because of how it was chucked. They tasted okay though I suppose.  As for the pan roast, I really didn't see anything special about it.  It's basically some seafood with a lot of tomato cream sauce. The seafood was fresh, but I think you can easily recreate the sauce with some jarred pasta sauce and heavy cream.   I think the best part about the whole thing was watching the chef prepare the food right in front of us. The food itself though...it wasn't bad, but I don't really think it's worth the wait either. Sorry, Oyster Bar!",

When we arrived there was about 6 people ahead of us so the wait was about 35 mins. This place is worth the wait! If you have never had steam kettle prepared food this is the place to try it! My wife and I both ordered the \"Palace Station Pan Roast\" with lobster added to both orders. You get to select the spice/heat level of the dish. We kept both to a level 3 & that was pretty mild.I did see them make some level 10 using fresh habenero chili in it. And over heard the chef saying that they make one using ghost chili. All of this for me pretty much would waste the taste of the shrimp, lobster, crab etc. Anyhow our Pan Roast was the best we have ever had! And we have 2 places close to where we live here in so cal to compare it to. The Boiler and Ritter's SKC both of these places have ties to this place. We also ordered 2 tiger shrimp cocktails. They were top of the line severed with a home made cocktail sauce with fresh ground horseradish. The quality of the shrimp were top notch. OK here is some advice........DO NOT come here if you are in a rush. Don't come here if you are impatient .Don't come here if you are not up to standing in a short line that moves very slow. For us it was well worth the wait. Watching the staff prepare the dishes was a show in its self. Hangin out and chatting with the locals is way cool also. Most of the patrons that were here when we were, were locals and return customers. It was nice to get out of our 5 star blah of the Aria and the ol 45 dollar buffet blues to have something different and tasty! We will definitely return here!",

    "text": "If you are a oyster bar fanatic and lookin for some louisiana style cooking without the Vegas crowd...look no further.  This is Las Vegas's hidden gem for an oyster bar. Yes, its located in Palace Station (North of the Vegas strip). Located near the back of the casino.  The Broiler \"the restaurant\" is boring IMO. The real action, food and fun is at the Oyster Bar. The bar only seats about 16 people and can sometimes have a long wait. Its hit or miss. Seating overlooks the crazy-looking cooking contraptions that make your meal...while munching on your bread.  Food:  I recommend the Palace Pan Roast (the one with everything in it & most popular) and had it with rice (I get the rice on the side, to enjoy every bite individually!) I've had the Pan Roast with pasta before and the pasta takes away from all the flavor, and was not as good. I also had/tried the oysters, clam chowder (red and white - I recommend the white)...NO complaints here, pure hardy goodness!  Atmosphere: Older crowd/older casino vibe (it is Palace Station...ya know?), but everyone is friendly. Staff is great and makes my every visit that much better. Jennifer (server/waitress) sweet gal that makes you feel at home. JJ (one of the chefs) is hilarious! He seems quiet....and then he'll randomly make the most hilarious comments or convos with you.  I try to come here everytime I am in Vegas. Highly recommend if you like seafood/oysters.  They do have a location in Chino Hills and also therr us also Ritters in HB, Costa Mesa....its okay, but not as good as the Vegas location for some reason.",

Waited in line for an hour and a half but it was 100% worth it. We ordered the combo pan fry which is is crab, lobster, scallops, and clams in one delicious creamy soup base, with a side of rice of course. You can order the combo pan fry with the spicy level 1-10, I got 4. We also ordered half dozen raw oysters which was surprisingly large in size, the clam chowder is is a big portion so I recommend getting the cup size instead of the bowl. We also had the shrimp scampi was my least favorite but it did have a lot of flavor. The scampi was a very soupy broth instead of a creamy white sauce that I was expecting when they asked if I wanted white or red sauce. Overall though the food was amazing, would definitely come back(hopefully not when the wait is over an hour though)",

    "text": "I used to love coming to Palace Station back in the day.  This is when I went to school, had no job and looked to stretch my dollar as far as possible.  Fast forward - now that I have some sort of an income and have gotten accustomed to staying on the Strip, I was a bit surprised by what I had considered to be posh 15 years ago.  But then again, I also thought that a burger qualified as \"gourmet\" as long as it had some Thousand Island dressing in it.  Employees here wear badges stating that they love locals which is a sign that they are not attracting many out of area visitors. Where most of the locals seem to congregate is at the Oyster Bar which is sort of a misnomer since most of the people are not sitting there eating oysters. The bar has an unusual steam contraption that allows the \"bartender\" to cook your gumbo, etoufee, etc made to order. The cook for that night, Ricardo, showed amazing deft at handling all of the orders and making each one individually.  Although it is not made from scratch (they use a paste concentrate for the gumbo stock), it tastes amazing.  Since the seafood is added that moment, it has not been simmering for hours which explains the fresh quality that it imparts.  My favorite was the combo pan roast, another misnomer, since nothing is ever really roasted.  It is more of a cross between cream of tomato soup, bisque, and cioppino.  The gumbo is also very good and you can request a custom level of spice.  I ordered mine at level 7 and it proved to be moderate in heat. I appreciate that the crab they add in their dishes is already out of the shell. I also recommend that you ask for the rice on the side so that you have the option of enjoying the soup on its own in between bites of the yummy seafood.  I didn't get to try the clam chowder but that looked good enough for me to christen my first child in.  If you come late at night, especially on the weekends, be prepared for a long wait. There can be large parties waiting ahead of you and sometimes they will hold open seats so they can be seated together.  This unfortunately adds to the wait times.  But if you are lucky, you will also be there when the freaks come out at night and get a dinner and a show.  Go hungry as they give you a pretty large bowl.  Prices may be a bit on the higher side but it is well worth it.",

It's literally a bar/counter restaurant with 18 seat which means yes.... the lines are unbelieveably long! We got there on a Saturday at 2:30 pm after setting up for Magic.   The line didn't seem too bad with about 10 people in front of us but what we didnt realize... was that the people standing in line were with bigger parties that were either gambling or sitting down at the slot machines!!! They were taking turns standing in line so it was actually about 22 ppl in front of us!!! Ughhhhhh!!!! I am probably the most impatient person in the world so this was quite a challenge for me. But then again, I love food more than I hate waiting so I sucked it up, bought a gossip mag and sat at the slots while my guy friends waited in line :)   Anywho, we finally sat down and was served by 5. The total was 2 and a half hours but gosh darnit... shit was deliciousnesssss!!!! We got 2 palace pan roast for the 3 of us and 2 dozen oysters. I requested level 7 for the spiciness and it wasn't nearly as spicy as I thought it would be. Oh and they ran out of chicken so they threw in lobster instead and gave us a discount which was awesome of them!   I would definitely come back and since they are open 24 hrs, I'm gonna come at a totally off hour cuz I can eat this anytime of day. I'm thinking around 5-6am after a nite out will be perfect! This has got to be the best thing I can eat when i am drunk and hungry. CAn't wait to come back! Oh and I wanna bring a oyster bar virgin with me cuz this is one of those places that you get excited to bring new ppl to!",

At first glance, I thought certain pieces were scallop but it was actually lobster meat. We liked it so much that we back the very next day and brought 7 other friends. We all loved it and had so much fun and laughter. Many thanx to Sandra the waitress, Bob the chef and one other chef (Asian guy) but I didn't get his name. If the owner is reading this, we dined around 3:30pm on September 7th, 2012. Sandra is a sweet heart. She knew we had a large party and did her best to seat us all together and made sure we were happy and taken care off. Bob has a very sarcastic sense of humor and bantered with us the whole time and so did the other Asian chef when they had the shift change. We all believe Bob overheard us saying  that level 5 spicy wasn't that spicy and took offense. When all of my friends ordered level 7, I think he gave it something extra because it was SPICY. Luckily for me, he didn't cook my dish until last so I was able to taste my friend's level 7. Immediately after sampling level 7, I barked at Bob to make mine a level 6. He looked at me, laughed and called me a name that rhymed with wussie. Everyone at the counter busted out laughing. It was the most enjoyable part of my vacation. All of us definitely will be back.  By the way, the dish that I ordered the second time was cioppino. I loved it, thought it was better than pan roast and etouffee.  I plan to keep ordering cioppino until I get sick of it.  The only complaint is that the dining area is quite small. Only 6 steam cooking devices and approx  18 seats. I wish they expand to hold more people. Luckily, they open 24 hours but still, I am sure most of the time, there is a wait. We waited 2 hours for our seats.  The very next weekend, I tried a place near my home in Southern California called the Broiler located in Chino Hills. The cooking method is the same but the taste is not. Ingredients didn't taste the same either. Maybe because Oyster Bar is backed by a casino so the result is that they can afford better quality items.   Looks like I will be planning more trips to Vegas in the near future.",

    "text": "I LOVE the Pan Roast!!  Almost everyone I bring here LOVES the Pan Roast!  I consider myself a foodie and this is my favorite place to eat in Vegas...really.  I've been to several fine dining restaurants in Vegas (Delmonico's, Charlie Palmer, Michael Mina to name a few) and this is my favorite place to go because it's a local favorite.  There's usually a line almost every time I come, except if it's right after opening or right before closing.  This time, we got there around 11 am and there was only 1 other person at the bar!  I have NEVER seen that.  It must be a sign of the times.    On to the food....my go-to order is the crab and lobster pan roast, number 6 for spiciness  with 2 scoops of rice.  I've had the combo pan roast with shrimp and oysters,  the linguine vongole and the etouffe but the crab and lobster pan roast is my favorite.  There are large chunks of super-tender  fresh lobster that literally melts in your mouth and a sizable scoop of fresh lump crab.  I always make sure to watch the expression on my newbie friend's faces when they take that first spoonful of pan roast....the initial look of shock at how good it tastes and then the sheer joy afterwards knowing there is a giant bowl of it left to devour.   Most dishes are cooked on these heavy-duty metal steamers (see pictures for the visual) that emit steam to cook the dish.  First the veggies are thrown in (tomatoes, celery, onion and peppers maybe) then the fresh seafood is next to cook.  Then the creamy, tomato based roux is added to simmer down and mix together with everything.  Then this heavenly goodness is poured into a large bowl with a sprinkle of chives and a scoop or two of white rice.    It's killing me to write this review from hundreds of miles away.  I usually eat about 3/4 of the pan roast and I always wish I had a larger stomach so I can finish it all.  I keep telling myself I would try the gumbo next time, but I have to have my crab and lobster pan roast first.    We usually get the tall chef with the baseball cap who chats with you like he's been your neighbor for years and the waitresses are supernice and quick with the refills and will wrap up your leftovers in a flash.    Don't judge the book by its cover....I know you'll be skeptical of this bar area when you first arrive but there's a reason why this place is one of the local favorites...it's a hidden gem.  Don't bother trying the pan roast at the other Station locations or even the restaurant that is right next door, they just can't duplicate the original pan roast here at the Oyster Bar.",

That's a good sign =D  Had happy hour oyster, clam steamer, and etoffe, sadly they were out of bullion base. Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.   Soup was cooking inside the pot for a while making all the juices from seafood come out.... portion is HUGEEE and generous amount of seafood items.   I didn't like the clam steamer flavor,  they had some kind of Italian seasoning on top, like oregano? maybe.... not my thing but still, everything was amazing especially for hang overs",

I had the \"combo pan roast\". - Asked how spicy I wanted it, from 1-10.  Asked for 5, but should have said 6-7.

We started off with a dozen of oysters and I'm generally very picky with oysters but these we're perfect- didn't taste too fishy and were also pretty big. We also tried the steamed mussels, which came with a large amount and were soaked in a delicious broth that we eventually used to dip with bread. The Alaskan clam chowder was also amazing with generous amounts of seafood within. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, the pan roast. Oh, the pan roast. It has me hungry when I'm full. I got the combo roast and added the andouille sausage (recommended if you're like me and prefer lobster over chicken). I got mine spicy and added lemon, creating the perfect ratio of creamy, cajun, lemony tomato sauce. If I had to choose one dish next time, it'd be the pan roast. To top it off, relatively cheap beer AND great service! The only downside is the wait. I will definitely be back and recommend to all!",

    "text": "Craving some delicious seafood soup after a long night of partying/gambling/sinning while in vegas? Oyster bar is the place to go! The Pan Roast Combo is a lovely and happy mix of lobster, shrimp, and shrimp in a lobster bisque type of soup. Also recommend the Alaskan Chowder which is the same mix of seafood goodness but done up clam chowder style. Both soups are very rich and flavorful. Both soups are very filling so be prepared for left overs. You'll be transformed (via stomach) from hungry-hungover to happy-ready-for-bed!   Why only 4 stars then if its so good? The wait. Unfortunately, there are only about 15 or so seats and there are only 6 stations for them to cook at so you may be waiting in line for 2 hours before you can eat. Avoid coming at noon or dinner time if you want to avoid the line.   Good friendly service. Definitely a gem in the dirt of an old beat up hotel I wouldn't step in to for any other reason. Its a must stop when I'm in town. So to answer that crazy question you encounter every once in awhile in vegas, \"What would drive a man to leave the comfort of his on the strip mega hotel at 5am and go to an old crappy looking beat up hotel on the outskirts of the main crawl?\"  Oyster Bar my silly friend. Oyster bar.",

The wait was still an estimated 1.5-2 hrs. Good thing there are slot machines around so I can gamble. But one of my favorite things was waiting in line and getting to meet the nicest people in the world who are in the same boat as you. Everyone gave our group amazing suggestions as well as the chef and waitress too.   New England Clam Chowder was awesome! Good amount of creaminess and clams. I would totally order that next time all to myself. We also ordered half oysters on the half shell which were fresh and good, but similar to other places I've eaten. Combo Pan Roast hit the spot! I ordered mines level 4 spicy and it still made me sweat a little. My friends did level 8 (option is 1-10 I believe).   Highly recommended! This place has been on my bookmark for ages, I just got lost the first time I attempt to look (I went to Imperial Palace not knowing there was a Palace Station Hotel haha). Have a cocktail and make some new friends and get ready for a yummy experience!",

    "text": "This review is one of the rare instances where the food is 4/5 stars but the wait time, unfriendly server, Christopher,  and virtually everything else ruined the experience.  1) yes, there are 18 seats and they refuse to make any sort of alternative compromise like a carry out. Let's just put it this way: the waiting time was so long, that I could have driven back to Los Angeles or take a plane from la to my hometown of northbrook Illinois! We are talking well over three hours from start to finish. Good thing I had my book!  2) To add insult to my injury and to also burdensome to customers, you have to stand throughout the duration of this wait. If you don't do this, you risk losing your spot! I waited from 7:20 and did not leave until well over 10:30! I should have brought my godfather part 2 movie to watch!  3) management is unbelievably amateur and unprofessional and they don't care because there will always be a line. There were two seats unoccupied for 20 minutes before the next party were sat. When another customer complained, I witnessed Christopher be extremely rude to her. It also took Christopher many minutes to clean each seat as there was a lack of urgency on his behalf! With 18 seats there should always be a sense of urgency to reduce wait time!  3) the owners make no concessions on the price as well! 25 dollars for the three hour wait is not kind!  4) I got the combo and it was pretty good. They were somewhat stingy on the seafood. I also ordered it 8 out of ten on the spice scale; it was more like a four.  5) caught the chef sneezing twice and did not wash his hands. The bar has a panoramic view of the lone chef, but I guess he does not care.  6) I did not order oysters, but the name oyster bar does not withstand if they run out! The customer sitting next to me was heartbroken when Christopher told her we're out! Imagine that? if your name is the oyster bar, and you are out of oysters, we have a huge problem!  Conclusion: will not be coming back here with the beyond unreasonable wait time. This is the longest I've ever waited in my life for food, and I regret wasting my time here.  No more angry! Word to the wise: don't buy in to the hype!",

Though I do love that it never closes. But you know what? It just might be worth it!!!  The pan roasts are all full of flavor, loaded with goodies, and absolutely amazing, and you can actually see the chefs at work right in front of you! The steamed mussels are also delish--I really wish I got the try the oysters, as oyster bar IS the name, but raw oysters on a drunken 5:30 morning didn't seen too appealing.   As with all Vegas joints, the prices are fairly steep (compared to say, Kettlebar in Anaheim), BUT like I said, it's in Vegas and its 24 hours...you really can't complain. Do come give it a try--you won't regret it!",

If you are a die hard seafood fan, this is the place for you and yes it is worth the wait. They cook the food right in front of you while you wait. They have a line but it goes smoothly depending on how long people are sitting around hanging out after they're done eating. We only waited 30 minutes or less. Ricardo, the cook is seriously  a beast! He preps and gets everyone's food going. He manages 6 different cooking pots at once !! Will be back for sure !",

    "text": "Maybe we were expecting too much from this place when we came...(especially since yelp reviews indicate 4.5 stars!)...but we were a bit underwhelmed.  Our wait was only 25 minutes, which was great compared to what others experience (we arrived at 2:05 pm or so on Friday afternoon)  Our chef was a bit grumpy; never smiled, never really talked to anyone that was eating, and we kept hearing him sighing. haha...maybe he just needed to go on break or something.  We ordered: (1) Combo Pan Roast - shrimp crab lobster; fresh seafood sauteed with Brandy, Cream, and Tomato, served with steamed rice), $21.99 I had high hopes for my pan roast, but it was OK overall. Flavors were great, and soupy. Felt like the amount of lobster/shrimp we got was very minimal though - so was disappointed by that. Maybe that's how it is with the Pan Roast? The seafood content in the gumbo + diablo was more than that of the pan roast, not sure why. We also ordered a spice level of 8 and it was way too hot, lol. I was sweating bullets, although my husband enjoyed that  spice-level. Since we shared this entree, they gave us 2 scoops of rice separately (in 2 separate bowls). I was telling my husband that next time (if I come again & the wait is not that long), I would order an entree w/ more seafood content, such as the shrimp & lobster diablo! haha :)  (2) Oysters on half shell - dozen, $18.99 - fresh and a good size, but not the most amazingly fresh oysters I've had. They shuck the oysters right there and then, after you place the order. It comes with slices of lemon, cocktail sauce and horseradish paste. This is served to you before your entrees come out. From a price perspective, it's more worth it to buy the dozen for $18.99 instead of half dozen for $12.99.  Service was very limited, there was just one chef (who was cooking everyone's meal), and a waitress who had to take orders and bus the bowls, plates, pour everyone's drinks, etc. There are only 18 seats along the bar, too.  Overall, it was fun to sit at the bar and see how the cooking is done; but we would probably only rate this place a 3.5-3.75 stars. I'm thinking if I tried the \"shrimp & lobster diablo\" next time, I may change my mind and upgrade the stars. :)",

    "text": "WORTH EVERY MINUTE IN LINE.. Undoubtedly, this has got to be the Ramen Dojo of oyster bars!  Very limited seating around a semi-circle bar, leaving only 18 seats available to the most oyster driven consumer.  One can be left frustrated, but don't relinquish your place in line, as it will be worth the wait.  Give up immediately if you are under 21, as patrons must be 21 years and over to partake in the festivities.  Some encouraging words from my husband as we stood agonizing in line were, \"This is the best Oyster Bar in Vegas.  It's worth the wait.\"  Okay, with that said, all I could do was smile...  The afternoon started off with 14 people ahead of us in line; after an hour and twenty minutes, we were next to be called.  We took our seats on the most comfy bar seats ever to caress my derriere.  For you ladies, look under the counter for purse hooks.  Today, there was only one cook and one server.  They were working swiftly and without pause.  I've never seen a two-man show move so quickly and efficiently, holding up the \"nautical sails\" of this oyster bar so effortlessly.  Without hesitation and for the numbing effects of our long wait, I ordered a 23-oz Shock Top on tap.  In the rush of things, our server accidentally poured two 23-oz. Shock Tops.  Immediately upon realizing this, she just pushed both beers our way.  Hoorah!  Cheers and smiles flooded our faces, as well as that of our fellow diners; wishing that it had happened to them, they could only be happy for us in return.  The fun is at the bar!  Welcome to the \"sensory seat\"!  Visualize two people gliding across the kitchen \"stage\" in perfect unison (no collisions today), food prepping, pots clanging, water running, steam rising, stations warming, ladles scooping, plates gliding, beer sliding...and then you can get a glimpse of this oyster bar chasm, cut from a small section in the Palace Station Hotel and Casino.    My hubby has been visiting this establishment for over 20 years!  Needless to say, I left the ordering to him.  We were famished.  Here's our tummy bursting feast.  NOTE:  their potions are fairly large...  *Oysters on the half shell ~ These were quite the mouthful.  If you prefer tiny ones, I would suggest not ordering these.  They were sizably squishy and yummy, and accompanied by a cocktail sauce with horseradish.  *Combo Pan Roast ~ This is one of the dishes for which they are known.  The Combo includes a generous amount of shrimp, crab and lobster.  First boiled in water, then a special mix of sauces and seasonings are added to the seafood pot.  It only teases and entices as one sees it cooking right before their eyes.  The boiled seafood broth is richly savory.  It is accompanied by white rice.  State whether you would like it on top of your pan roast or on the side; I prefer it on the side.    *New England Clam Chowder ~ smooth and rich with pieces of decadent clams.  One more note about the BEER.  The 23 oz. glass is yours to KEEP!  Refills are half price.  Refill it before you leave the bar, as you can carry it with you as you head out to gamble.  Enjoy the feeling of the moment.  In California, we just don't carry out our unfinished drinks.  It just doesn't happen!  Cheers!",

I told my husband, \"this place better be worth it.\"  I can only review on the dishes I tried:  1) $10 for 6 raw oysters - I've had really good oysters before, so I would say these are pretty mediocre...grimy, creamy, and lukewarm...knowing how easily oysters can go bad, why were they not stored in colder temperature? 2) Clam chowder - it's New England style, which I don't have a problem with. It's just, again, mediocre. My husband, who grew up in east coast, was not impressed. 3) Pan Roast with extra Lobster - they do give you a large portion of lobster. I found the dish just OK. Too buttery, fatty, and much of the same taste. (You can share this dish between two people... it's huge). You can also add spiciness - 1-10. A group next to us ordered 12. Whoa.  I think I understand why people do like this place: If you are a seafood fan, the restaurant gives you large portions of crabs, lobsters, shrimps, oysters, and clams for budget-friendly price. I also realize the taste caters more to people who indulge in very rich, buttery foods. I wished I tried their jambalaya or any of the chef's specials - those do look better. I am a seafood fan, and I do not mind 1-2 hour lines if the food is worth it. For now, I am unsure if I would go here again - it's a very long wait for OK food.",

    "text": "I have been here twice with my husband; first time we had better experience because the wait wasn't too bad and the food we ordered were good.  Hence, we came back for the second time and we deeply regretted; we were not impressed with their seafood strew this time. For some reason the soup base was way too salty, we could not even finish the 30% of the stew; we just picked out the seafood, washed with water to eat and left the stew alone. Not to mention we waited 3.5hrs for this salty meal.  Service was slow; we waited 26min for our strews and for our oysters/clams plate, it was ready right in front of us, but it was sitting on their counter for 16min before the server took that to us. It would be easier if the person who opened the shells to deliver that plate to us when he's done; literately just had to lift his hands with the plate 12 inches higher.  However, the raw clams were really fresh, sweet and tasty; the oysters were huge like rocks but it was pretty fresh. Hence, I'm leaving them two stars.   I know tons of people love this place and perhaps it was only that one bad night; but we don't plan to come back.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about the oyster bar. It's legendary for long lines and people who are willing to wait 2 hours to get a seat. I got there around 5:45pm and got seated around 6:45pm. Even tho the line was not long. Usually one person waits and that person waiting may have 6 or more in the party.   Now let's get to the food. I got the pan roast which is what they're famous for. They ask you what spicy level form 1-10 . I chose 3 and it was perfect for me a tinge of spicy hot. Next time I'm gonna try level 4. the guy told me the spicy level all depends on the chef on duty, when I went he told me the chef is right on the money. The pan roast had crab, shrimp and lobster. honestly the flavor remind me of chicken tiki Marsala almost except with sea food. It was very good and worth the wait. Next time I'll try something else. My friend also got half dozen oysters, he said it was good and regretted not getting a dozen. Everything is cooked right in front of you. As soon as you sit down they give you a warm dinner roll with bread. The service was excellent and  refilled your drinks without even asking. Definitely a place I would recommend when in Vegas.  The long wait does suck and why a place that is busy 24/7 doesn't expand doesn't make sense.",

It also took a total of almost 3 hours from the time we waited in line till we finished our meals and paid.   We all have to say it was well worth the wait only if my buddies and I didn't have to wake up at 630am for a tee time at the TPC the next morning. The food was great! Good to kill the hunger, good enough to absorb up all the alcohol and good enough for a hefty late night meal/early morning meal at 3am! We were able to try the New England Chowdah and 3 orders of the Pan Roast. It took the chef a little longer just because each Pan Roast took a long time to cook up. There were only 6 steamer also.  Don't pass up the Oyster Bar. Be patient cuz you'll be waiting at least an hour and enjoy your Pan Roast or Gumbo. I'll be back the next time i'm in Vegas.   OPEN 24 HOURS.",

I instantly thought \"NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT!\" I said aloud (in the words of my nephew), \"NOT TODAAAAAY!\" So, we decide we'd go back later on in the week. And sure-nuff, (don't act like y'all don't know Ebonics...lol) you heard me, sure-nuff, the line had 8 people in it and the wait was only 35/40 minutes. We weren't going to miss this opportunity. And got in line...lol...We sat down and saw that the food was prepared right in front of you, yes fresh. I ordered the Caesar Salad, Pan Roast (at my spice level. I felt special) and tasted my god-sister's Gumbo. I loved it all. Great presentation, clean, flavor was on point. And most important, I was full...lol. Yes, try this place when you're in LV. Steve, Robert and Brenda were great hosts...God-sister, GREAT RECOMMENDATION!",

The spice level is no joke so if you can't handle it, make sure you get the spice level 5 or below.    Come here when Chef Bob is working...I've been lucky and always happened to eat here when he was cooking.  I was eavesdropping on the convo some regulars were having with the waitress.  Apparently the other chef just doesn't make the Pan Roast taste as good as Bob.  Chef Bob reminds me of Ray Romano in case you need a visual on what he looks like.

We trekked our way onto the other side of the freeway away from the strip to a run down looking casino called palace station. I would NEVER come here if it weren't for trying out the oyster bar, and I dont think a lot of other people would either but apparently word got out because the line was long. And clearly everyone waiting in line heard of this place through a friend or yelp because amongst the old white people gambling at palace station, the people standing in line for the oyster bar were young asians.. such a vast different crowd within the same hotel.  We had 15 people ahead of us at 3pm on a saturday and waited about an hour before we were seated. Man, the chef works hard, he works non stop cooking those dishes in front of you, shucking the oysters, cleaning the pots.. wash, rinse, repeat. We ordered the 1/2 dozen oysters, beer, pan roast combo, and the alaskan chowder. The pan roast was just the right amount of creamy and was rich in flavor. It was so frieken good..  the oysters not so much, it didn't have the brineyness to it that i love. The alaskan chowder had thick chunks of lobster and shrimp, they certainly dont skimp on seafood.   This place is open 24/7 but apparently, there is always a line no matter what time you come. You can always make your hubby wait in line while you play a little at the casino.. always works for me :D",

You could barely tell that there was any lobster in my Panroast. In the past, there were chunky pieces of seafood in it but not this time. I also ordered half dozen oysters and they tasted like kerosene. It might have been a bad batch. The oyster guy said that it's from the south. BP oil spill tainted??? Anyways, it's the first time in my life that I left raw oysters uneaten.",

I don't even like raw oysters and I tried one and they tasted so fresh!

Which is quite often I might add (at least once a month. Asians love to gamble lol)   We always try to go when Ricardo is working! He makes the best food & the style when he cooks is added entertainment. There is usually an average wait time of about 1-2 hours (TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT, DON'T SKIP OUT!!!!) The aroma of the food being cooked alone will draw you in it's captivating!   It's open 24 hours though, you might be lucky & can catch a slow/dead time middle of the day/night on a weekday maybe. I always say if it's all these people are waiting & they're ALWAYS BUSY it must be good right?!?!? (circumstantial) lol  I don't know what took me so long to get around to writing the review (let's be real I'm lazy) but I get the same thing every time because I'm afraid of change. lol no kidding but I know it's good. The Pan roast -  you can add a side of rice or fettuccine noodles. I'm a pasta lover so go figure for the fettucine. Dozen juicy oysters shucked fresh. Absolute perfection. If I'm there during oyster shooter happy hour 3 for $10 I get 3 with some tequilaaaa (when in vegas am I right or am I right?!?!) If my entire family is there we also get clams to share!  You'll leave so happy & satisfied I promise you won't regret it. Unless you don't like seafood then I'm sorry we can't be friends.",

I will admit that I was a bit disappointed when the chef was refilling his station with frozen items, but I'll still give it 5 stars.  I think the \"Oyster Bar\" is a bit of a misnomer as the oysters were nothing to write home about.   The chef is heavy handed with the spices, so be wary when choosing your level of spice from 1 - 10.   The wait made me want to punch someone in the face, but I do have to admit that experiencing the pan roast was well worth it.",

The oysters were so plump and juicy, the pan roast a concoction of fresh seafood and spice. The service was impeccable as well, as they made sure you were happy with the meal. I would skip the cioppino next time, it was too salty. The line management can also use some improvement, some folks tried to cut in line and security had to be called. Otherwise, a perfect meal and the station in Harrah's cannot even compare (a dozen oysters cost $10 more at Harrah's).",

So this past weekend I got to visit Vegas for my birthday, and decided to pay oyster bar a visit. I knew the line was gonna be long so I specifically chose to come here early on Monday morning, I'm talking about 4 am type of early! I walked in expecting to get seated right away and boy was I in for a surprise..... there was a line! Mind you it was 4am on a Monday, so I was completely in shock; ended up waiting for almost an hour to get seated! Not gonna lie I was getting pretty frustrated with the wait so I had high expectations when it came to the food. I decided to order the combo pan roast with a spice level of 7 out of 10 and the three shooter special with vodka ($12). The shooters had quite a bit of vodka and nice chunk of oyster as well and the pan roast definitely lived up to the hype. The only problem I had with the pan roast was their use of previously frozen seafood but the flavor definitely makes up for this minor issue.  Overall verdict, oyster bar is definitely worth the wait. I just hope they can expand the place in the near future or hire another staff to offset the wait time a bit.",

    "text": "The line for this place is SO long. Even if it looks short, the restaurant only seats around 18 at a time and it's bar style seating so you have to wait for seats next to each other to open up.  When I first got seated, I immediately ordered a 50oz beer ($15) and I got to keep the cup as a souvenir!  Other than that, I shared the following. The portions are huge, there's no way I can finish an entree on my own.  - Dozen Oysters: I was actually quite disappointed, being an oyster bar at all. Some oysters were really yummy but others were just abnormally fat, chewy and sandy. However, I normally prefer smaller oysters. These oysters are so huge that they look unnatural. I actually prefer the oysters at the Oyster Bar in Harrah's.  - New England Clam Chowder: This was super yummy! The soup was so creamy and buttery..I was very surprised since not a lot of people ordered the soup. But probably one of my favorite clam chowders!  - Combo Pan Roast: I didn't know what a pan roast was but it's essentially a bunch of seafood and vegetables tossed in a special tomato based soup. This was my favorite entree for the night! It was super flavorful and fresh. I really love tomato based soups so I may be slightly biased. But this is a must try!  - House Gumbo: This was yummy too but I liked the Pan Roast more. I thought the gumbo was spicier and saltier so we had a harder time finishing this. But I liked the sausages and the seafood was still fresh.  Overall, I don't know if I'd want to wait 1.5 hours again but the food is definitely yummy. The portions are also big and the prices are for fresh seafood so you can't really complain.",

I had the Atlantic chowder which was delicious and I would have given it 5 stars based on that but the combination pan roast that we had was only okay. The 4.5 stars was a bit overrated but I think 3.5 stars is more fair. Overall, if you are a local then I think it would be a good place to frequent but if you are out of town and coming to Vegas for some yummy food then I would try something else.",

Level 7 is just the right medium for spiciness. Portions are huge and we noticed most finished only half an order.  The chopino came with better quality prawns and seafood than the pan roast. Pan roast was rich, buttery and flavorful. Overall good food but if you had the Chipino at the Atlantis in Reno, it cannot compare. Was it worth a 1.5 hour wait? Probably not but we are glad we tried it out. We would come back if there was not a wait.",

Cigarette smoke was all around us, patrons of the hotel were skimming between the line to a counter where they picked free $5 bottles of champagne... wielding them off with one hand like they had won the lottery. $5 minimum blackjack tables were around us, a sign touted $15 rooms for the night.... just in case this meal was so good we wanted to ditch our comfortable hotel in favor of slumming it and eating at the oyster bar everyday. A crazy idea at the time...  But a rational thought afterwards.  We carefully planned our Vegas trip around hitting the best restaurants in town. We had extravagant meals paired with great drinks in fancy places..... but what was the best meal I had?   The Combo Pan Roast at Palace Station.  My girlfriend was adamant about coming here for the pan roast. And so we went. After waiting in the line for over an hour I have to say that I was growing impatient, and even frustrated. There was no way this meal would be worth that kind of wait. Oh, but it was.  We ordered oysters and the pan roast. Don't even bother with the oysters. Go all in on the pan roast. That's what you came for. And, like the experts who sat next to me, order one to go as well. That was a good move.",

    "text": "3.5 - I still wish we are able to give half stars. The food is a solid 4, the location off the strip and the long wait brings it down a notch.  I hate leaving the strip. I only leave when others suggest it and this happened to be the case. I was told Oyster bar is a MUST and as a big time foodie i had to check it out for myself.  YES, the food is good. Is it worth the 2.5 hour wait, NO!!!  My friend told me she waited 45 min even at 3am so this place seems to always have a wait. We went on a Friday at 8pm and by the time I had food in front of me, it was past 11pm - I was dying of hunger...I was hangry by the time we ate and it threw off my whole night.  If you are from LA/NY or any town with great food on the daily, there is really no reason to go off the strip and wait in a long line as they have such limited seating, it's a bit of a pain.  The pan roast is good...I didn't love the chicken in mine but the seafood portion made up for it. The sauce is very heavy and buttery. Clam chowder was also tasty and fresh oyster shooters were awesome. The pan roast can be shared. I suggest you get the pan roast and something else a bit lighter if you are ok sharing.   Service is slow which added to my frustration. As a few other reviewers mentioned, there is no sense of urgency, I guess since they are open 24 hours and there is limited seating they take their time. But after waiting such a long time, I wanted a \"quick\" dinner and it was very slow. I guess it doesn't help that there are 4 or so kettle things to cook in and the staff is just gossiping.   TIPS: -Do not go during regular eating hours. This place is open 24 hours a day so go \"off-hours\". ----There is only 18 seats in a bar setting,  don't go in a group - 2 should be max. I made the mistake of going with 4 people.  -Eat a snack in advance...don't go there hungry. Go at least 1.5 hrs before you \"think\" you want to eat. -If either you or your friend is not a fan of seafood, don't bother, there are plenty of great restaurants that take reservations you can go to that cater to both parties.",

Each dish is made to order and they only have about 16 bar seats I believe, so don't come here hungry. You'll get hungry while you wait in line.   I ordered the combo pan roast and my goodness it was enough for two people to share! It's so creamy and delicious, you've probably never had anything like it before. At least that's how I felt, and I literally wanted to swim in it. IT WAS THAT GOOD! You can add extra seafood, chicken or andouille sausage and make it as spicy as you want from 1 to 10.  A trip to Vegas is not complete without setting aside 3-4 hours to enjoy a bowl of pan roast.",

The downside to this location is the bar seating; but, boy, the food is worth the waiting.   If you are a seafood lover you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  Our favorite is definitely the Pan Roast! The sauce is soo addicting and compliments the seafood well.  Portions are large, so you can usually get 2 meals out of it... unless the line builds up your appetite for the whole things.  The crab caesars salad and New England clam chowder are also worth a try for a nice lunch.  Oysters are always fresh  and plump too. This is a True hidden gem!",

Ordered 2 dozen of their finest oysters and the Palace station pan roast (crab, shrimp, sausage).  Hard to describe how good it was, it was just really damn good.   Some reviews said they waited forever but I got there around 230pm on a Thursday and was seated 10 minutes later. Pretty quick or I was just lucky people ate fast.

Yep, drive 4 hours for a combo pan roast! Call me crazy or insane but once you try this place you will understand.  My wife and I both had the \"Combo Pan Roast\" at a 7/10 heat made to perfection by the legend himself BOB. Only negative to this place is the long wait in line which can be up to 2 hours. Was fortunate enough to come here today at around 1145AM and found open seating.   Only place I would ever consider waiting hours to be seated.",

    "text": "4.5 stars, will return in the future to try more dishes before deciding whether to bump up the rating to the full 5 stars.  Finally tried Oyster Bar after being recommended by multiple people. My senior resident and I decided we would go on Friday morning after a long week of night shifts, and we finally made it over! It was a strategic decision as well since at 7AM on a Friday morning, there is very minimal wait time.  This (original) location is inside Palace Station casino, and it is literally a bar with just a handful of seats. Right when we sat down, we were given glasses of ice water and a warm sourdough roll. Service throughout was prompt and attentive. One of the cooks kept joking with us (they like to tease newbies/Oyster Bar virgins like me).   My senior resident (who has been multiple times) insisted that I had to try the combo pan roast, so I did. They have a really nifty cooking vessel for preparing dishes and while our dishes were not prepared right in front of us, we got to see other orders prepared in front of us.  The combo pan roast is this really rich, flavorful dish of shrimp, crab, and lobster in a brandy, tomato, and cream sauce. You pick a spice level from 1 to 10, and I picked 4, which had good heat without feeling too spicy (I can't imagine what 10 is like though). The dishes costs over $20, but there is a good amount of fresh seafood and is a fairly large bowl. It is served with a bowl of steamed white rice and you are given a gigantic spoon to eat with. I loved that this dish came out piping hot, and quickly devoured it all. Amazing flavors and good texture of the seafood. Wasn't wowed enough to give five stars, but there are so many other tasty things on the menu that I will have to come back, especially to try an actual oyster!",

But it took us 2 hrs to eat here, even though the line only took us 10 mins. Now you should know how the long line came.   After we got seated, everything is super slow. I understand the food is freshly cooked. But there's much more the chef can do to shorten the wait. This chef I'm talking is in some pictures. He is super slow to put things in order. I'm saying that coz we saw another Asian chef came after him was doing things much more quicker.   In terms of the food, it is creative for them to cook everything in those six pots. But is it necessary? The base is pre cooked. The only use for pots is mixing frozen seafood with the base. Yeah, everything they use is frozen. It's okay to use. But is it worthy to spend three hours to have it?   One star is for the creativity.",

No one really knows about this divey hotel and casino because it's off the strip...and quite honestly it was very unmemorable to me until now.  I apologize for not taking notice to you Palace Station but you should thank your lucky stars that you are the home of the Oyster Bar.  In one of our many girls weekend getaways to Vegas, a friend introduced us to the Combo Pan Roast...what is a Combo Pan Roast you ask?  Well...you can compare it to a seafood stew filled with lobster, shrimp, and crab in beautiful sauce that you can determine how spicy you want it 1-10, of course 10 being the hottest!  My first visit I did a 6 and that was not spicy enough for me, so the second time I did an 8 and it kicked my arse...but it was still delicious!!!  Other must try dishes are the Seafood Jambalaya, House Gumbo and their Alaskan Clam Chowder (not your typical clam chowder because they add lobster to it also...AMAZINGLY GOOD!)  Most dishes are served with the choice of either white rice or pasta.  It's in the center of the casino and considered a bar, so no one under 21 is allowed to even eat there.  There is no formal dining area...there's about 12 bar stools that overlook their little kitchen area.  They make their dishes right in front of you too and everything is from scratch.  There's no stove, but a really cool cooking apparatus the allows the chef to make up to 6 dishes at a time if I recall, that is why it may take up to 30 to 45 minutes just to get your food.  They do give you warm sourdough rolls to start that are to die for also, but make sure you make room for all the deliciousness they serve up.  Prices are standard for seafood dishes between $18 - $25.  Beer and wine only I believe, but beer is available on tap.  The best time to come if you dare to eat this late or early, depending on how you look at it is around 1:30 in the morning.  Yes, they are open 24 hours!!!  No wait and stools are readily available for you.  The worst time to come is lunch time, dinner time and every hour in between.  You literally have to stand in line and trust me, your wait time can be as long as an hour to an hour and a half depending on the size of your party.  But don't worry, it's definitely all worth it!!!!!!!!!  Make it a priority to try this place on your next visit to Sin City.",

After reading about the rush here and wait for seats and finding ourselves looking for lunch late afternoon on a Tuesday we thought, this is our chance! Good plan.  I didn't quite understand from the other yelpers the whole \"cooked in front of you\" concept. Maybe on my mobile app I didn't read enough. But while we sat down and helped ourselves to a couple of Wedmier hefeweizen and had a dozen oyster shucked to order and started on those, we watched the magic occur.   There are 6 'pots', all plumbed directly for steam. They place your selected seafood into the pots with some wonderfully seasoned broth to start the cooking. Midway in the cooking, then they add the necessary differentiators for the different orders. Gumbo gets a roux, \"pan roast\" gets a cream brandy sauce (not following how that is a roast, but I digress), etc... Heat is adjusted to your liking, and the 7 out of 10 was really perfect for people who like spicy but still want to taste their seafood.  Major kudos to yelpers who let me know going in that the plate split was wise. No way we should have gotten 2 entrees. A dozen oysters and one pan roast washed down with beer was perfect for the two of us.",

Because of my love for scallops I opt to have the Scallop Shrimp combo made without shrimp, just scallops, which the chefs have always been happy to do for me. This is THE place to take a friend or family member from out of town for the best seafood experience at very reasonable prices!   Open for lunch through midnight most nights.",

    "text": "Definitely worth the wait.  Worth the smoke smell that your hair and clothes will carry after said wait, debateable.  But you're in Vegas and that does come with the territory.  Oysters on the half shell were good, not stupendous.  Primarily due to the varying sizes and not quite being properly shucked (having the bivalve disconnected from the bottom shell is pretty standard where I grew up) and the gumbo is again, good but not great.  I think that the roux would need to be darker to garner more flavor from it and to deepen the overall taste of the gumbo.  But again, you're in LV, not NOLA.  The pan roast is everything people rave about.  Seriously, not even something small to pick at here.  I loved it, as did my husband (his second trip.)  Go to experience it at least once.  Return to bathe yourself in the cream sauce that is the pan roast.",

There was only 6 people in front of me and I waited an hour and half. A lot of time people are ordering take-out and would sit at the seating area as they wait...which I don't understand. If you're just waiting, step aside and let those who are going to be dining in to sit and eat! Second, the service here... umm it's random. It can suck, and it can be really great. But doesn't matter because here at the Oyster Bar, it's all about the food. Get the Pan Roast. Done!",

    "text": "This place fails on so many levels. The largest issue is that no one seems to be in charge here. They have a cook and 2 waitresses.  They lack adequate seating which leaves a long line of hungry people waiting at least an hour to be seated.  I attempted to eat here on a couple of occasions but didn't because of the line.  When I saw a short line on my last night I decided to try it. The waitresses leave dirty dishes in front of empty seats for 10 minutes + only extending the wait for everyone.   Once I was finally seated a waitress dropped a roll in front of me after a few minutes.  I wasn't actually greeted for another 10 minutes. The waitress who spoke to me asked what I wanted to order and at that point I had to request a menu because she didn't notice I sat there with nothing. I did order something because of the amount of time I had invested. I got a Caesar salad with shrimp to get something quick. The waitress was rude. 'That's all you want?' Followed by a sigh & smacking her mouth.   The salad had 3 shrimp on it, powdered cheese that 5 year olds eat on spaghetti,  a limp romaine lettuce.   Save your money & TIME.  Go anywhere else!",

Chef Ricardo and Sandra were on shift that  Friday night and dude, I seriously felt bad for them. The place was packed and there were at least 20 people in line waiting, but both of them still provided great service. I guess my hour and a half wait was not too bad at all. There was a group of 6 older folks from LA who told us they've been waiting for 2+ hrs but always come here when in LV. They assured me that it's \"very well worth the wait\"  Hubby got the etouffee spicy level 8 and I had the Pan roast with oysters, shrimp and crab spicy level 7. When we finally got our orders and had my first bite, I TOTALLY GOT IT. It felt like it was a dish customized for my discerning palate, perfect in every way. They were not stringent on the seafood either, as I devoured the chunks of sweet lobster in my soup. Hubby loved his etouffee as well. We knew at that point we are going to be frequent customers (writing this makes me want to go NOW). It will also be a go-to restaurant when family/friends come visit.   I love spicy foods and seafood, and I can't think of any other place that can rival the Oyster Bar. This place tops my short list of must-try-eats in Las Vegas.   ***Note: Pleasantly surprised that they also give 25% military discount! So don't forget to show your ID card when you're there to save some serious $$$.",

Still our leader of the pack and all time favorite.  This was good.  At level 5 it wasn't that spicy.  I had to pour on the hot sauce.  But it was good and we will return.  The oysters were meaty and large.  The shrimp cocktail was good as well, although the cocktail sauce was weak and seemed commercially prepared.  Not the best, but certainly edible.

The pan roast was good and filling - I realy like how you can choose the spiciness on a scale of 1-10.  I chose 4 since I was sharing, and i could have probably handled a 6.  The clam chowder was okay, but much better once we threw a little hot sauce in it.  Overall, this is definitely a place we'll be back to.  Not sure if I'd wait in line for 1-2 hours like some yelpers, but we were able to walk right up and eat at noon on a Wednesday.",

    "text": "Usually I would question the seafood in Las Vegas because its so far from the ocean...but Oyster Bar never disappoints with its freshness! I must mention I lied when I said Bacchanal was the only place in Vegas I would wait in a line for; Oyster Bar inside Palace Station is the only other place I won't complain waiting in line for. Although, I do wish they'd buy up more space on the floor and put in a couple extra tables..   Everything they offer here is ahhmazing -both for the taste and view ;) As in their name, oysters, here are superb and a definite must order when eating here.  I highly suggest the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab. And (not or! lol) the gumbo. Just do it. You will not regret it my loves.   They charge an extra $5 if you share entrees but its totally worth it because the portions are very generous. There are no take out orders -which although can be frustrating, I do appreciate it because that means your food is as fresh as possible. And for those of you who like to fill up on soft, buttery bread, they offer that while you wait :)  Another thing I really enjoy is that you can watch the whole process of your delicious foods being prepared, cooked, plated/bowled right in front of you! The chefs are all so nice too. Makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Last, for those of you who are going with another person who can't quite handle the heat like you, you're always welcomed to adjust the level of spice in your dishes. But I'd suggest nudging the ones who can't handle the spice, to the plate ;P seafood is always more yummy when its spicy!",

We had our 99cents margaritas from Palace Station in hand while waiting in line. (The best and worst idea). Margaritas filled us up a little. Our group of 5 girls shared 3 combo pan roasts (shrimp, LOBSTER, crab). We finished total a little over 1 bowl .. woops. To-go'd the rest of them. There is a $5 charge to share bowls. The pan roast was so creamy and delicious - my favorite part: CHUNKS OF LOBSTER. Ohhhh yeah =) You can only eat so much at a time though since its so thick and creamy so you'll always end up wanting more .. beware!  Our bill came out to be about $100 w/ tax and tip.",

So finally, I'm in Vegas, not super hungry and it's pretty early for dinner so I'm up for the challenge. There are only 16 seats at the counter so that explains why there is almost always a line of people waiting, though they are open 24 hours!  Our wait was only 20 minutes on a Wednesday at 6:30pm. Everything smelled divine. We ordered oysters on the half shell which were super fresh and yummy. We also had the Seafood Pan Roast (spice level 6) and the Bouillabaisse (spice level 5). Both were delicious! The Pan Roast is very rich and decadent...with all the cream and butter in it, really tempered the spice. In fact, I thought the Bouillabaisse tasted spicier than the Pan Roast. We made our own combination of the two since the Pan Roast was so rich, we added some of the Bouillabaisse broth to it and it was superb. I enjoyed all the assorted seafood and the rice that came with our dishes. I would definitely make it a point to come back if it's not a killer line. It's probably a good thing that I live in CA otherwise I would either go broke or gain 100# eating here.  I am jelly that my DH is back in Vegas 2 weeks later without me, enjoying the Cioppino this time. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I wonder if he'll bring home some Pan Roast take-out...hmmm.",

Corey is a champion holding down the fork with  being the only cook. The Hostess was amazing to, sorry I forgot her name.   We ordered one dozen oyster, one dozen clams, Alaskan Chowder (#5 for spices), and Combo Pan Roast (shrimp, crab, clam and lobster with #5 spices) with rice on the side. The food was amazing! The wait was worth it.   We can taste all the shrimp, crab and lobster in the Alaskan Chowder, especially love the kick of spices. My husband was falling sleep so we have to pack the Pan Roast to good. We have one bite before we passed out and I have to said, it was amazing. Will definitely come back here and try the bouillabaisse - look amazing!",

It literally is a bar that seats only 18 people. There's usually always a line and you can end up waiting for hours. Tip: go on a weekday. There's usually one server and one cook. Despite how busy they get, they seem to always have a smile. The chef cooks everything in front of you. They have a wide variety of gumbos, pan roast, pasta and etc all made to order in front of you.  We ordered: a dozen of oysters on the half shells. I was skeptical about oysters here cause come on now, we are in a desert.  It to my surprise it was fresh and tasty.  Alaskan clam chowder. Delicious, creamy, fattening but oh so yummy. Filled with lobster, shrimp, muscles, clams. Every bite was worth the calories.  Shrimp scampi. buttery goodness in every bite with the shrimp and pasta cooked to perfection in texture and broth very sweet from its natural seafood broth...and butter.   Seafood jambalaya. I liked this dish but only thing was it had way to much rice in it.   You get to choose a spice level from 0-10.  Now enjoy!",

    "text": "I almost didn't want to write a review for this place because I don't want more people to know about it but I couldn't help myself. The first time I went here was with my boyfriend and I was very skeptical to where he was taking me. When we got to the bar, there were a handful of people in front of us. I didn't think much of it but 1.5 hours later, we finally sat down. At this point you can imagine that I was a little annoyed with my boyfriend for making me wait that long and I was starving but he assured me that it was worth the wait.  I don't say this often, but he was right (just kidding, kinda)! We started off with a dozen oysters and after telling the chef how long we waited (he probably hears that a lot) he even threw in a couple extra oysters for us! The oysters were huge! One was half the size of my hand. They tasted very fresh -- no fishy taste.  My boyfriend and I shared the combo pan roast with two sides of rice. It was love at first bite. It was my first time trying pan roast so I didn't have anything to compare it to but in terms of just best dishes I've ever had, it was pretty up there. It comes with generous amounts of seafood. And unless you want to take some home for later or you have a big appetite, I think this dish is great for sharing between two people. There's supposedly an extra charge for sharing, but I think since we order oysters, we never see a sharing fee show up on the bill.  This last time we went was on a Sunday around 2:30 p.m. and there was well over a 2 hour wait so we decided to eat somewhere else. It's worth a wait but not when you're starving. We went back the next day around 11 a.m. and only waited about 30 minutes. I noticed we also had the same chef as the first time I went and he hooked us up again! At the end of our meal, he made us these oyster sandwich crackers, which were yummy. This place wins in food & service!  I highly recommend going to this place next time you're in Vegas and want to get away from all the fancy restaurants on the strip. Warning: you must be at least 21 to sit at the bar, don't come in large groups, and be prepared to wait in a line no matter what time of day. Once you're at the bar though you can order to-go for those who couldn't make it with you -- although, like anything else, it's best when it's fresh. I love you, Oyster Bar!",

Not going to lie...I waited almost 2 hours before getting a seat... Then add another hour for cooking, then another hour and half for eating. Lol.  But was the experience worth it you ask? Hell yes.  Thank you \"Corey the chef\" for making such amazing, fresh off the steamer hot chowder and gumbo dishes. Simply Amazing. And Christopher our server. Super cool guy.  But \"its just chowder\" you say. I'm never going to wait that long for just chowder. Suit yourself... That'll mean shorter wait times and more chowder for me. :D  I'll be back oyster bar.

He was cleaning out his pots but let then run overflowing for the entire time we were there.  I just do not like to see that kind of waste.

I saw it as a tremendous risk; after all, it's in the Palace Station for crying out loud, where I could have gotten a room for a few days for the price of my meal. I don't even think I've been in there before. Not to sound snobby, but there are LOTS of choices around here.  Anyway, the bottom line is that The Oyster Bar may as well be the New Orleans Embassy. Of course I had to have the Combo Pan Roast, and a half dozen on the half shell, to keep me occupied during the wait. I don't feel like typing all night, just count on all the positive reviews being True.  I got there at 4, and snagged THE open seat. When I left after 5, the line snaked through half the casino. And it's not fast food, so just chill and enjoy yourself.",

Clam chowder was chunky and creamy with plenty of clams inside not watered down at all, huge serving we shared the smaller serving. The House Pan Roast I ordered was at spice level 6 perfect for me maybe couldve pushed 7, cause I love spicy hot. It was super hot, just like I enjoy my soups and there was plenty of meat inside, they do not skimp here at all. So many flavors hitting you at once, making me crave some right now thinking about it. I will definitely be back. Word of advice dont eat here if you plan to go out partying because after this meal I was so stuffed I went back to my hotel passed out and didnt wake up for the Club. Also, come early we got here at 0530 Friday night for dinner waited about an hour and a half and were done by 8pm. The wait is sooooooo loooooooong due to limited seating, be courteous if you eat here, once your done with the meal kick rocks were waiting people!!! Finally prices were very reasonable considering this is Vegas and you are getting huge portions here with quality food.",

The pan roast takes time to cook and skipping your turn means a good 20min + delay when you already starved yourself while waiting in line. We got our food by the time that group finished their food. Sure, you can say I'm being too tough on them but youll be pissed to when youre as hungry as i was. I was just wondering why people tend to go to the one inside the palace but the food is no different from the other Oyster bars. I guess people tend to come here for their 24/7 open hours? The food was similarly good as the other oyster bars but I rather go to the one inside Harrah's (on the strip) for little or no waiting in lines and multiple dining tables rather than 10 seated bar. The waitress was slow as hell and they dont even bother giving you a refill. They seemed occupied by talking to one another. I will never go here again and I recommend anyone smart enough to do the same.",

    "text": "To be completely honest I did not have a good experience, BUT the pan roast was delicious and that is why my rating is 4 stars. The service on the other hand....  It started off with the boyfriend and I deciding at 2AM to get some late dinner. He was excited to bring me to this place because he claimed the wait was worth it. Horrible idea to go to this place when your stomach is already starved.... Major downside is there is no place to sit while waiting in line for hours. We waited the average amount of two hours to be seated. At this point I am cranky/hangry. Only because the server was extremely slow (I'm going to say maybe it was because he was exhausted). Instead of cleaning tables and seating people as quickly as possible, he let 10 seats empty (people left at different times) until he finally cleaned up and seated people. This place seats a total of 18......  Finally seated and excited to get some food. We ordered the combo pan roast and combo gumbo, both five stars. Let me say we were second to place our food order as the people next to us ordered first (they were seated first, we were seated second).  The food is now coming out, but the confused server decides to give our pan roast to another couple and bags up the gumbo thinking it was an error....... The worst part was that the couple pointed in our direction I'm assuming they were saying we placed our order first... But they still ate the given pan roast. My boyfriend speaks up and the server is apologetic and can see I am extremely agitated from hunger. He says he is sorry and gives us a bowl of clam chowder to tide us over a little. He promises that to apologize for the wait and error we will only be charged for one entree.  Finally! We got our food. The pan roast was extremely delicious. The gumbo was not our cup of tea. We got 5 star heat but the heat felt more like an 8 or 9.. We're not sure if that was another error made by the server/chef.   Meanwhile, there was a party of four ladies that got seated the same time as us. The server messed up three of the ladies orders...... I personally do not think that the food is worth the (2+ hour) wait and slow service.",

Regardless of what time it is you'll wake up and go to do it because it's that good!!!! That's what the Oyster Bar is to me.   Parking: Your at a casino, take a taxi and save yourself some time.   Service: Ok folks as noted the wait here can be ridiculous. I came at 3:30 AM and there was still a 1 hr 30min wait. Don't expect magic, they got only bar seating for 18, so you might not even sit next the people you came with. But who cares when the food taste like this.   Food:  Oysters: Hot diggity they got an oyster special from 1am-9am. 1/2 dozen for $10. You know that's the way to go. They did a great job cleaning the oysters and they tasted extremely fresh!!!! On top of that they give you exactly what you need: Lemons, Horse Radish, and Cocktail sauce. Ha even a little splash of Tabasco and papa bear was happy.   Pan Roast:   Mannnnnnnnn, that thing is how you wish you could cook seafood. Right flavors and lovely large pieces of fish. No joke the serving size is huge. I even popped that big girl open in the morning for a little recovery snack!!! In all seriousness the best best (soup, stew, gumbo) however it's categorized in my life. On top of that you get to pick your spicy level which is super important to me. I love a dish that comes out not needing any additional love or flavor. It's by far the best thing I've had in Vegas EVER!  Suck it up and wait in line \"That's what she said\"  \"If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late.\"",

The trick is to grab a few drinks from the bar. That way, when it's your turn to be seated, you'll forget all about the wait and devour on the awaited dishes.  The gumbo is absolutely good. As soon as it hits your tongue, it awakens all your taste buds. There's no better place in the West Coast to get gumbo but here. The pan roast is outstanding. The creaminess and spices mixed with seafood makes your mouth wanting more. Just thinking about the pan roast is making my mouth salivate! We also love their fresh oysters, clams, and shrimp. There's no other place in the desert that serves fresh seafood for reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Apparently this little oyster bar inside Palace Station (about 15 minutes from Venetian) is always packed with a 2 hour wait, but we went at 1am on a Friday early morning and no line! Though we had to wait for ten minutes or so because the seats we were destined for were still occupied. We got seated and immediately I loved the vibe of the servers. Super friendly and welcoming, even at 1am in the morning! I wasn't feeling super hungry, so I shared the pan roast with a dozen oysters between me and another friend. The chef was fun to chat with during the meal and they cook it all right in front of you! The pan roasts were very interestingly cooked - I can't really explain it but you can see in my photos or try it out for yourself! The oysters were alright - still a bit sandy and fishy tasting, but with the hot sauce and lemon, it helped! The pan roast is a very generous portion for around $20. The dish even has spice levels! My friends opted in for 3 and 4 levels out of 10. 4 was the perfect kick for me, since I'm not much of a spicy person, but 3 was perfect for those that don't do spicy at all. There were a lot of shrimps in the pan roast, but the rice that came with it pairs perfectly with the flavor. I definitely want to return! I will be back Oyster Bar!",

Everyone is so busy behind the 16 seating bar that one can understand that everyone had to wait as long (or longer than you) so once you get seated, you want to take your time on savoring every bite of your made to order plates. We got half a dozen oysters, (they were almost as big as my palm) and we opted for a bowl of clam chowder to start. A very generous portion for the price! We also ordered the combo pan roast and Etouffe... we couldn't finish half so asked for it to go. They are very considerate, the put it spoons which came in handy as our suite with kitchenette did not have dinnerware. I obviously snacked on the leftovers luckily with the spoon given! Highly recommended! I don't understand why they don't expand, but then again, why fix it if it ain't broken? Go there and wait in line when you're about to get hungry. Once you smell the aromas and see the anticipation on people's faces, you'll be anxious and excited to be seated! Bon appetite!",

I actually find 5-star table service uncomfortable and I don't like to dress up, lol. So Palace Station is right up my alley!  I feel like the wait time has just expanded immensely over the years, but I will make a note to come for early lunch or early dinner (and def not anytime after midnight).  The wait time will vary from 1 hour to 3 and sometimes you think it is short, but the people up front are actually saving spots. Wear your 'I am patient' hat and get ready for some quality eating.   Their pan roasts are the best with their bold, creamy sauce and spicy flavors mixed together into a giant bowl.   I literally drool thinking about their food.  I like their combo one (seafood) an the palace one (which has sausage).The last time I was here I was hungry when I stood in line, then about to faint from hunger when we sat down two hours later!  Luckily, a beer and some time later, Bob saved me with the palace pan roast.   SO GOOD.",

The food is great, but when I sat down and took a closer look at the menu, I realized that this isn't so much an oyster bar but  more of a restaurant.   We ordered the half dozen oysters, in which you get what they have.  No selection to choose from.  We then ordered the the gumbos, in which everyone at the bar seemed to be ordering.  The gumbo was great and are able to choose how spicy you want it from 1-10.  I did a 3 and it was perfect for me as I am not to fond on spicy foods.  Depending on what you order the gumbo comes with plenty of seafood protein.  By the time we finished our gumbo, we were stuffed for days, and \"food coma\" brought new meaning to me.    Pros: Great seafood, everything was delicious. They make the gumbo right in front of you. There is a lot of variety to choose from, but seems like people come here for the gumbo.  Cons: Its opened 24 hours, but if you go near a prime time expect to wait a long time as the bar only seats about 16 people. Its not really a True oyster bar.  If your looking for variety of oysters do not come here because you will be stuck with one type.   I am not sure if its best to cook gumbo with frozen seafood or what, but I wasn't impressed when I saw the chef opening up a bag of frozen shrimp and restocking the line.    Overall: I highly recommend coming here.  The food is great, and very filling but I am not sure if its worth the wait.  So probably best to come at an off hour.",

    "text": "4.5  Let me start off by saying this place is LITERALLY a bar - 18 seats total, and MAYBE one more if they're feeling generous. So basically, if you're coming with a group of 5+ I'm judging you (just kidding... but seriously).   Despite the size, wait, and being off the strip the food is AMAZING and makes up for all the little nuisances.   We ordered the clam chowder, raw oysters, and the combo pan roast (lobster, shrimp and crab). The clam chowder was hearty and did not skimp out on the clams or potatoes at all. Raw oysters were good and definitely tasted fresh. The real winner, however, was the PAN ROAST. Sooo filling and hearty! A cup of rice is included with the pan roast but personally, I think it tastes even better with the complimentary bread they provide. It's a bit pricey and they charge you if you're sharing (unless you buy ~$18 worth of appetizers), but there were two of us and we even took it to go so I believe it's worth the price. You can also adjust the spice level (1-10) and even ask for peppers on the side.    Tip: It's open 24 hours and I heard the best time to go with minimal wait is around 8-9 a.m. I went around 6:30-7 p.m. and the wait was about 1.5 hours.  If you're tired of all the buffets on the strip this is definitely a tasty alternative!",

    "text": "Been wanting to go here for a very long time.  Even though we live here, just never made it.  Well, very mixed feelings about a place that has such a sterling reputation.  The wife and I arrived mid afternoon and maybe a 15 minute wait.  Employees were very nice and appeared to be focusing on their jobs.  We ordered two drafts, a dozen \"gold band oysters\", I ordered the Bouill-Roast, and the wife ordered the Bouillabaisse.  First off both the Bouill-Roast and Bouillabaisse were outstanding.  My big complaint is that they boldly advertise \"gold band oysters\".  They are oysters from Louisiana that are pressure washed clean and the process also makes the oysters open to shed their meat.  The washing process is suppose to clear all dirt, bacteria etc. and make for easy serving as they recluse the oysters and put a gold band around them to keep them fresh and closed.  Well, I watched these people pull out some of the smallest oysters I have ever seen, that were dirty and they had to be hand shucked.  They were not, I repeat not Gold Band Oysters.  O top of that, more than half of them were not cut from the shell, and they were loaded with broken shell.  Worst of all is that four of the oysters were not much bigger than a nickel.  That is extremely small.  Felt very ripped off.  People sitting next to me expressed the same mediocre feeling about the oysters but said they were from the Midwest and use to being served inferior seafood.   Never again",

    "text": "My experience with the oyster bar is not pleasant. I understand it's first come first serve but, it felt like my business was not wanted. Now the food was absolutely great, but the service was definitely not. As far as opposite as you can get is how my experience was with this oyster bar, which there are plenty of in Las Vegas apparently.   First we waited in line, okay. I don't recall reading anything like that when looking up reviews, but we all have to wait at some time or another in our life. I understand it's a challenge if there's 1 seat open and 3 people waiting. Not a big deal. So for those of you whining about that, that's not what made up my review rating, but disclosure so you know when you visit. We did wait for 45 minutes on a Monday evening. FYI.  Once we actually sat down, it took about 5 minutes to get the attention of the several different employees floating around to get bread and our drinks. Then we ordered appetizers, I did have a 12 piece of the oysters with a sprite, boyfriend had a shrimp cocktail. The waiter, again one of many, asked if we'd like to order our entrees then. We said no, we'd like to eat and then if we're still hungry order more food (which isn't an illogical statement). I realize now that the waiter could've been more truthful and said \"it'd be better to order now so you're not waiting later\". And boy, did we wait.  We waited 20 minutes after finishing our food. No conversation. We came in to eat, it was incredibly frustrating. Even people sitting next to us were waiting as well. Meanwhile, a group of 8 comes up to the bar and their orders are being taken before ours! Now not only have we been waiting, but even if I had ordered, mine would be stuck behind these people. No offense to them, the blame is on the servers. The cook and a woman with glasses and long dark hair, both of them were busting their asses but there's only 2 of them while another bald gentleman with glasses seemed to be floating around while there was clear need of customer service.   Woman with the glasses comes over to us, at that point we were DONE. We asked for the check, and when asked so kindly by her why we were leaving we told her. She removed two drinks from the tab-a soda and an iced tea-and offered her sincerest apologies, as did the cook, which was greatly appreciated and was a hell of a lot more than what any other employee there made to make us less mad.   I won't be coming back at all and I suggest anyone reading this to take their business elsewhere.",

The oysters are freaking huge and so fresh here compared to any place I've ever been to. The clam chowder was good too. I honestly believe everything here is delicious. The wait is worth it. Came here at like 6am and there was 2 people in front of me so that wasn't bad, but there was a lot of people at the bar. They open the oyster shells right in front of you. The happy hour here is a great deal! Definitely coming back here for the oysters and gonna try out the whole menu if I can lol",

Clam chowder $4.99, Seafood gumbo. $24.99.  You determine the level of spiciness in the gumbo ranging  between 1-10.  The oysters are freshly opened upon order, We watched her open at least 3 dozens within 15 minutes.  They were super fresh, and chunky,  clam chowder was creamy, but not overly buttery.  filled with clams.  The seafood gumbo had the enough amount of heat, level 5, it did not compromise the freshness of the seafood and the herby spice of the Cajun taste in the gumbo.  The okra was not slimy with a crunch.  It was a show stopper watching the chef prepares the food right in front of your eyes.  The only draw back was the extensive wait.",

The chef here is a master at his craft.  With that being said, he takes his time to perfect each dish and it can take a while.  Understandable and I wasn't too tripping.  The pan roast is to die for.  It just has this something that makes it taste amazing.  The texture, the taste the aroma.  It was euphoria for me.  I definitely don't recommend large groups.  Its just tough because the only seats are at a bar.  They are limited so be prepared.  If you're lucky enough to finally get a seat.  Be prepared for some delicious tasting food coming your way.  Next time you're in Vegas be sure to stop on by.  I believe there is another Oyster Bar in Vegas but you gotta go to this location.  Way better.",

I was intrigued by the sheer number and quality of the reviews of this place so I figured I had to try it. I wish I had done my research ahead of time because I was definitely NOT expecting to wait for almost 2 hours on a Sunday at 2pm. I had no idea that the Oyster Bar is actually just that.. a BAR with maybe 18 seats total. Don't be fooled by how short the line may look, it takes forever to move!  When I finally sat down at the bar, I was so hungry I wanted to order one of everything on the menu. My dining partner and I settled on 3 oyster shooters with vodka, a bowl of clam chowder, the famous pan roast, and gumbo. Everything was delicious but my favorite dish by far was the pan roast. SO DELISH! I might be persuaded to return to the Oyster Bar on another visit to Vegas but you can believe I will do my research to ensure I wait no longer than 30 minutes to 1 hour maximum. Anything more than that is just a waste of time, in my opinion.",

    "text": "Finally. I have tried Oyster Bar's famous Pan Roast!!   I've just recently heard a lot about Oyster Bar, and it was on my list to go to on my 24 hour Vegas trip. Got here on a Thursday around 11:45 AM, and was seated by 12:30 PM! Not bad!   I read reviews that their namesake, oysters, were good. They were from Louisiana and probably the biggest I've seen. They were NOT good at all. They were also poorly shucked as I had to scrape it off the shell with my fork. For $12 for half a dozen, it's cheap, but I would skip it.  Service is a bit scattered, although there's only 16 of us at the bar, the wait staff seem to forget simple items asked like lemons, napkins, forks. Really nice and accommodating though. The fresh and warm rolls are really yummy too. You keep nibbling at it while smelling the yummy food cooking in front of you.  I thought the pan roast would be in a flatter bowl judging from the photos, but it is deep. OMG. So much food. The first bite was literally a taste of heaven. The creaminess, richness, and all that yumminess that comes together, WOW. Tons of crab (I kept getting shell which was not fun), lobster meat, chopped veggies, and a whole lot of shrimp. I ate two, and counted 10! With the rice, wow, it was just so so so worth the trip.   I definitely think the pan roast is worth sharing because it really is a heavy dish and a LOT of food. If I was not going to be out and about the strip for 10 hours and flying which wouldn't allow me to travel with more than 3 ounces of liquid, I so would've carried the leftovers back with me. But, that's too much trouble for me and had to set a limit.  Just writing about the pan roast is making me salivate at the mouth. Yes, you have to wait in line the entire time and have everyone present. But it's so worth it if you can wait less than an hour. Do it.",

The freshness and taste has been the same for the last 5 years. I try other places and their oysters but it doesn't have the same pop or flavor, they must have a really good supplier of oysters. Their seafood jambalaya is also exceptional, they blend the seafood and rice really well. Their fra diavolo was all right, nothing completely stands out. The oyster bars food is top notch; locals and tourists should try, because Palace Station just got remodeled! Let's look at the other things besides the food. Because of the limited seating capacity, you can expect a wait time between 1-2 hours which is normal. Because it is a bar seating area you may have to squeeze in places. Other than that, I would return it's just that I need to make sure I have 2-3 hours for 1 meal.",

I went here during the Christmas week so it took us a little over two hours to get seated.  But should I really knock off a star to a place that has amazing food?  This review is just based on how nice the chef was to us and the overall quality of the food.  Their special here is the pan roast.  Very similar to the cioppino you can get in San Fran but this is a lot creamier.  At first it doesn't look like much but it's filling and very flavorful.  I also ordered the combo seafood appetizer but that was mostly for the lady.  I don't eat enjoy raw food that much but she said it was great.  I ate all the shrimp cocktail from it.  If you're wondering whether or not this place is worth a try then my answer is yes, try the damn place.  The reviews speak for itself but if you justify great food for a long wait then have someone wait in line while you drink and gamble.  Then pay for their dinner.  Win-win situation.",

LOL. The way that the set up is made is that its a bar. So limited seating is available if you are in a big group you have to wait a while for all the seats to open up to accommodate your entire group. (I recommend to show up at an off hour so you don't have to wait as long)  When I go with my boyfriend I always get the Combo Pan Roast, plate of oysters and clam chowder. It's just absolutely amazing. I can't really express how good it is. Just trust me...go. Usually the place operates off of 3 people. BE NICE! One is the waiter handling all the seats. The chef who is making all the dishes and the bus boy who helps clear all the seats.   Go when you have the time to sit, relax, chat, and enjoy some really good food. You will not be disappointed at all.   Good \"off hours\": 7am, 9am, 9pm, 3am :)",

I was determined to try this place and figured the time should not be that bad.  We waited about 1 hour 20 minutes before were seated in the 18-seat only bar.  It's situated right out in the middle of the casino at Palace Station.  I ordered the Seafood Pan Roast and the hubs ordered the Bouill-Roast.  We both really enjoyed both dishes, but the seafood pan roast would be my favorite.  So fun to watch the chef cook everything from scratch.  I now will have to make this a place we have to eat at every time we visit Las Vegas.  So worth the wait.",

I ordered the shrimp cocktail, half a dozen oysters, lobster gumbo, and jambalaya.   Again I just wanted to try something new.  This style of food is one I have never tried before.  The chef is awesome.  Made me respect him a lot for the amount of orders he had and the traffic.  The only reason why I'm giving them 3 stars is because the last 2 dishes were slightly saltier than I was use too, but that's my fault.  I really wanted to order off of the pan roast section after looking at the gentleman next to me, but I didn't ask.  I don't think I'll try it again though, but it was a fun experience.",

We went at an off peak time at 2:30pm (they're open 24/7) so there were only 4 people in line in front of us. We were seated within 15 minutes and had the oysters, pan roast combo and Cioppino. Everything we had was delicious. Highly recommend getting those three things and sharing so everyone gets a taste.  I do wish they had more oyster options as they are an oyster bar but I'm not complaining. They were still fresh and scrumptious.",

I would say there is no good time to come here to avoid the rush because it is simply consistently busy. Hopefully you just get lucky because it was definitely worth the wait! Location is odd and with all the traffic they get you would think they would increase their seating! Service was good and they were interactive even though they were busy.  -Oyster in half shell-half a dozen was plenty for us 2.  Served with a little horse radish and their oyster cocktail sauce. No out of the ordinary special topping but oysters were fresh! -New England Clam Chowder-delicious and the we ordered the bowl size. I would recommend a cup if you are ordering pan roast. The portion was large and could be a meal itself. -Combo Pan Roast-shared this as well and it was more than enough. Highly recommend! I mean this is their signature dish and it's obvious why! Mouth is salivating now as I think about the shrimp, crab, and lobster in a spicy level 6 over the rice. Filling and satisfying! -Oyster shooters-I would not recommend getting it with tequila. It was hard to finish this drink!  This place is a must try when in Vegas but only if you are awake enough to endure the wait and not starving to the max because expect to eat two hours from arrival!",

Just like Louisiana!!!  Loved the calamari also. Could not even finish 1/4 of the huge serving.  This place just seats just 20 people, so prepare for a long wait if you do not show up at an off time (like 4PM on a weekday).  Its a great place for couples, but a trio or more might have a struggle finding a place to sit together.  Everyone is really social at the Oyster Bar, which added to my experience.  Will definately be back",

They used to have two cooks (plus assistants) running the place and now there is just one cook with one assistant. This means much longer wait times for the same food. This last experience took 3.5hrs (on a Monday) which involved about 15min of eating. No fault of the staff, there's just not enough of them. Who ever is running this place has decided to focus on profits instead of customer satisfaction. This place should have expanded a long time ago and the staff should have increased not decreased. Food is still the same but now that one of the former cooks opened his own place (more seating and lots of staff) I'll be going there instead of waiting here.",

Me and my friend decided to go there after a night at the club. She had raved about this place so many times (she's lived in Las Vegas her whole life) so one night we decided to go. It was a week day, and I think we got there around 4 am.  One would think this place wouldn't be busy so late (or so early in the morning) but we waited almost 2 hours to sit down.  I kept telling my girlfriend. \" this place better be good, to wait 2 hours\" and after we sat down, and got our entrees- if was definitely worth the wait and was phenomenal!. We ordered the crab pan roast- and I even had enough left over to take home!  This place is fabulous, fresh and a Vegas favorite!",

    "text": "No offense to Palace Station, but the only reason a tourist should venture there is for cheap gambling or Oyster Bar.  Actually, I take that back.  Oyster Bar is the only reason to go to Palace Station.  It's a True Yelp gem and I find myself craving it whenever I'm in Vegas and even when I'm not.  Seriously, the COMBO PAN ROAST is delicious!  The pictures don't really do it justice.  Under the sea of brown soup and rice, it's loaded with lobster, shrimp and crab.  It's a seafood orgy.  There's heavy cream in it, so if you are lactose intolerant, you might consider trying the gumbo.  But if not, the roast is the way to go.  I hear the Bouillabaisse is good too.  Everything at Oyster Bar is prepared fresh to order which is great, however, wait times can be really rough.  There are maybe 14 seats at the bar and only 6 steam kettles to cook the roasts.  This means they can only cook 6 roasts at a time and each roast takes 15-20 minutes to make.  Plus, I hear the wait to be seated at dinner can be as long as 2 hours so you do the math.  It also doesn't help that there is only 1 cook and 1 waiter.  Just go early to be safe.    Open 24 hours!  I've come at 3am once to no wait.  4.5 stars rounded up!",

It had Lobster, Shrimp and Crab and they did not skimp on those goodies. The meal is large enough that you can share (but there is a shared plate fee, so take it home and it will still be amazingly delicious a day or 2 later). All the food is made to order so after getting seated, you will have to wait about 20 mins.   The reason for the .5 star deduction is the wait time. The wait time is just horrible!!  But than again, it's \"Bar\" type seating.   I would most definitely come back but at odd times of the day to try to avoid the long wait.",

They also have a Moonlight Special from between 2am-9pm when there are drink specials and you can get a half a dozen Oysters for $10. The entrees are definitely worth getting as well as they do not skimp out on the seafood in your dish. Also tried the Shrimp and Lobster Fra Diablo which was very tasty as well. If you go for breakfast, there usually isn't a line otherwise expect to wait around an hour for other parts of the day. They only have so many seats and so many steam kettles to cook in.",

    "text": "Everything said about this oyster bar is True. I've desperately wanted to try this place out because everyone said it was one of the best joints in town. I even decided to stay at the hotel for one night just to eat here.   I had a party of four and arrived about 2 am. The bar was full and I had about 4 people ahead of me. As everyone said, the wait can be long and getting your food takes awhile. We weren't finished until 4am!  Even though there's only two people working, they somehow are able to work efficiently and smoothly. Watching them work was so hypotonic.   The pan roast was so creamy and delicious, sort of like a cross between coconut Thai curry and some type of seafood tomato base. It's a big bowl, so I would def share it with someone else (they do charge you $5 for sharing). The oysters tasted fresh and are great appetizers before  your hearty meal.   Staff was friendly and talkative. But one tip is make sure your order is right and check your pan roast for the right ingredients. I ordered the palace pan roast and we even got charged for it  but received the lobster roast, which happens to be cheaper.",

The line wasn't insanely long but it still took us a little over two hours to get a seating for 3. All I have to say is that it was worth \"the wait\". Hands down, you must get the fresh oysters and pan roast! The oysters were huge! A lot bigger than expected which explains why we ordered two dozens and couldn't even finish. They are very generous with their portions so order wisely. The drinks were good too. My dirty martini was made right and my friend's Bloody Mary had a perfect amount of spice. The oyster shooter was good even though it took more than one gulp to shoot it down due to the size of the oysters. In conclusion, we would come back!",

    "text": "It has been almost a year and a half since I've been back here. It was so gratifying and delicious to finally eat the oysters on a half shell once more!   First of all, this place is small. It's bar seating only that seats roughly 18-20 people. You have to wait in line to get seated. My first time here, we came on a weekend around midnight and waited over an hour! (But it was so worth the wait.) This time, we came on a Wed late afternoon and waited about 5 min.   On to the food: I highly recommend the oysters on the half shell. Super fresh and for the most part pretty big and fat in size. Comes on a bed of ice with lemons, cocktail sauce, and fresh horse radish. And OMG, their horse radish is divine. It's hot, but pairs well with the oysters. As for entrees, I recommend the pan roast, cioppino, and bouillabaisse. You can choose 1-10 for spicy-ness. The 8 has a kick.   The chefs cook the food and shuck oysters in front of you. They are very friendly. Service is good. They may get busy at times, but they do the best with the hands they have.   If you love oysters and seafood, you have to try this place. I recommend avoiding this place on weekends due to the crowds. Best to come between 1 AM and 8 AM or on a weekday during mid-morning or mid-afternoon to avoid the crowds and long waits. I will have to visit here again before we leave Vegas!",

    "text": "We felt like seafood so my BILs and i headed out to this place based on yelp's review. We went at around 2:30pm in hoped of beating the rush...to no avail, we were about 12 people back. Since this was our first time, we didnt know what to expect. I counted 18 bar seats and 1 cook (not a great combo). We took turns waiting i line while the others went to gamble. After 1.5 hours, we were seated (party of 3). A regular said that the wait time is very sporadic. Sometimes there are no lines, other time it can be very long. I suggest looking at menu ahead of time and ordering right away.  We started with the seafood combo (shrimp, oysters, and clams). The shrimp was nice and large. The clams were also good. I thought the oysters were just ok. They were large and meaty. I prefer small sweet ones (ie kushi or komomotos).  No mignonette to go with it. We chose the white alaskan chowder, combo pan roast, and bouillabaisse. The chowder and pan roast were amazing. The chowder was creamy and full of chunks of meat. The pan roast was nicely seasoned (kinda like a curry/indian seasoning). Very rich and hearty. Lots of meat as well. Both were large in size. The bouillabaisse was the weakest of the three. Good but not great.  We also ordered the 50oz beer for $15. That tipped us over the edge.  All in all, a fabulous meal. But not sure if I would wait 1.5hrs again.",

Pan roast, what's a pan roast and why are people going crazy over it? After waiting for 30 minutes to finally plant my butt on one of the 18 lucrative seats at the bar (the only seats, mind you), it took an additional 30 minutes before our food was prepared. Every dish is prepared to order, and the chef cooks up a storm right in front of you. I ordered the seafood pan roast (shrimp, crab, and lobster), and everything about it was worth the wait. Pan roast consists of tomato, creme, and brandy (at least that's what the menu says), whatever protein option you select, and your option of spice level between 1-10. I got the 5, which was perfect and not too spicy but with just enough kick.   Get the pan roast, you won't regret. The sister ordered the New England clam chowder, and as good as it may be, it paled in comparison to the glorious pan roast.",

The only real downfall about this place is the wait. It can go anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes. The struggle is real! They only have a few seats and 1 big group can make your wait time grow really quick. You can't lean on the slot machines, so you're left only to either stand or sit. I opted to sit. :)  Once called to sit, the chef/cooks are really friendly..and it's awesome to watch all the things that go into making your dish. I had their spiciest dish, and yes..I paid for it later. The price isn't too bad either. You get a big portion for what you pay, and the food tastes incredibly awesome.  If you're in Vegas as a tourist/guest and you're down for a bit of a drive, do come here and check it out!",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time last year and I've been hooked since. In my honest opinion I've tried the other oyster bars like at Sunset Station (close to my home) and Hard Rock Casino and none of those places can compare to the one at Palace Station.   I always get a combo pan roast level 4 spice and if we're feeling boujie we order half dozen of oysters! The pan roast is what they're known for, it just creamy tomato based heaven! It also comes with a side of rice and a roll! My boyfriend likes to get the bouli-roast (sp?) which I believe is a mixed of 2 different kinds tomato based. If you like it less creamy this is the option to go for!   If you go on the weekend expect to be waiting in line for quite some time, but it is all worth it!",

I got the bouilla-roast which is part pan roast and part bouillabaisse. I absolutely loved because it wasn't as earthy/umami as their regular pan roast which is what my boyfriend got. Both were seriously, amazing but big portions! Definitely come hungry!   Located off the strip in the Palace Station casino. It's a small little bar near the center of the casino when you walk in. Could probably seat 20 people max and its bar seating ONLY so def not good for large parties. There's usually an insane wait but fortunately we went on a weekday on off hours so we got to sit right away.   This was by far my favorite meal of my week long stay in Vegas and I will definitely be back again!",

Came back for a pan roast as usual, but today He encourages me to try something new.   Got the bouill-roast and it was pretty good. It has 3/4 sauce of the pan roast and 1/4 bouillabaisse sauce. So more of a tomato base in my opinion. Pretty good. Not much different than the pan roast. The seafood in this dish includes broken up king crab legs, crab, huge shrimp, lobster and mussels.  Always served with bread while you wait for your food and a bowl of rice.  Don't forget it's 21 & over here. Went for breakfast with my coworker and there was no wait (around 0745) love it when there's no line. Peak hours you could wait between 1-2 or even 3 hours!!!",

I could see why people wait so long- it's literally a bar that seats maybe 15-18 people?  We got half a dozen of the oysters, dirty chowder and the pan roast.  The pan roast is somethin else! It's got so much flavor that just soothes you and it comes with rice- RICE! My husband literally gulped down the pan roast.. i only got to try a little bit of it with rice.  The chowder was soooo creamy and delicious.  I noticed that all the other parties were to go-ing their leftovers and ordering more to take out.. I could see why!  The oysters were good too but I didn't really care for them. They cut open the oysters right in front of you so that was pretty cool.  I will be back for more pan roast! Don't get it too spicy though so you can enjoy the taste.",

    "text": "Nothing could prepare me for the first bite of the pan roast at this Oyster Bar at Palace Station.  It was like that near final scene in Ratatouille, and I was that restaurant critic. You know the movie with the French rat, Remy, who is a talented sous chef? And then Remy has his own restaurant (but hides in the back kitchen because after all, he is a rat, and a lot of people would have a problem with that?) And the final test for him is this super important but super critical French food reviewer, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole), who comes to test the restaurant, and, who usually ends up panning every restaurant chef, but takes a bite of the rat's Ratatouille and immediately he is transported to a little French chalet in the countryside where his sweet mama, the last person on Earth who ever cared about him, presents him, a school boy in shorts and long socks, with a hot pot of soup which warms his belly and his soul.  It is a surprisingly heartwarming scene of an animated film.  (And if you've never seen it, here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIh6jcKd7VwU&s=1dd199c894eda52aeb4b83d0133d89f4d5c609058813eb10749e249d8c1dacaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Ih6j...</a> )  But this experience is all about the food.  The first bite of this succulent, mouth-watering, mind-bending combination of crab, shrimp, lobster, and whatever other sea creature that makes it into this delicate and tender melange of stew, with a tomato base, and a lot of wondrous goodness, is one of the best food moments I have had in a long time.  And that says a lot for a \"foodie.\"  It is rare that in taking a bite of something you have to stop and just adjust your frame of mind.  But this is like that.  There are not enough superlatives to tell you how much I enjoyed this pan roast combo.  It was perfect.  It is the kind of exceptionalism that America stands for.  I don't know if it needed the rice that comes with, but it does complement the dish very well.  The only downside is that adding rice makes it more difficult for you to finish partaking of this work of art.  And not finishing it was not an option for me.  It is the Mona Lisa of pan roasts.  I do not think a photo does it justice.  I can see some people thinking of the Mona Lisa as \"meh,\" just a portrait of a plain lady done a long time ago.  And I think I was in that camp until I went to Paris before moving to Las Vegas one summer, and went to the Louvre and stood in the long line to get in, and took the winding paths to see \"La Jaconde\" (what they call the \"Mona Lisa\" over there), and then when I finally got close to it, it was like a mystery unveiled.  It was just weird how this painting seemed so vivid and lifelike and chilling.  I couldn't stop looking at it.  And then a gruff French security guard charged with keeping order around the masterpiece gives you the glance that says it's time to move on.  And you break your trance and you leave, but fuller, and maybe wiser. Probably not everyone has that feeling in front of the Mona Lisa, and perhaps not everyone will have that feeling when diving into the pan roast at Palace Station Oyster Bar the first time.  But if you do, you will understand what I mean.  Some down to earth notes: You will wait.  I was fortunate that I came around 5pm on a weekday so my wait was only 30 minutes.  Most spend longer than that.  You will not have anything like 5-star service, but good folks who are perfunctory and workmanlike, and that is appropriate since you are seated at a bar, after all.  You must be 21 years old to sit there.  You will be asked about the heat (spice) level of the pan roast: I chose a 4-5, out of 8, I believe.  My colleague chose a 0.  I think a little spicier is better.  (He also inhaled it, though).  Don't waste your time with anything other than the pan roast, or perhaps the gumbo, which also has high marks and is made in a similar way.  The actual oysters, ironically, are fairly flavorless.  Don't get them!  Don't get oysters at the Oyster Bar, people! LOL.  Get the pan roast.  As fellow Yelper Sammy M says, \"Holy buckets, this place is EVERYTHING!  Literally mind blown after the first bite.\"   Or, as Anton Ego put it in his fictional review in \"Ratatouille\":  \"There are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.  Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source.  To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions is a gross understatement.  They have rocked me to my core...It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at [Oyster Bar], who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France.  I will be returning to [Oyster Bar] soon, hungry for more.\"  Indeed.",

Don't hesitate to try this place. Get there early and get in line because you won't regret it!!! Definitely  worth trying!!",

    "text": "No idea how this place gets such high reviews.  The seafood was overcooked and Victoria the server was a horrible human being.    We stood in line for 2.5 hours for this at 4am, since everyone said we HAD to eat here when in Vegas.    Our group had 6 people.  They were able to seat 4 of us first and said when the seats next to us cleared, they can serve the other 2.    So the other 2 were standing w/ us and Victoria said they couldn't stand with us.  Ok, so they moved back to the line and waited there.  The 2 next to us finished and left and our 2 friends came to stand in that spot.  Victoria said \"what the hell is wrong with you guys.  why the heck are you so antsy.  I shouldn't even serve you\".  WTH?  How do you talk to customers that way?  After they waited 2.5 hours to try your food.    Disgusting human being, over cooked seafood, dry hard rice.  $55 for one gumbo and one pan roast.  NO THANK YOU.    I'm staying in the good side of town and not going to these craphole casinos anymore.",

However, I have to admit that it's worth it - and I'm not a patient man PERIOD.  But, if you come in the early morning (5am - 10am), there is no line whatsoever so I'm told.  I don't know who might be interested in oysters at that time . . .   I had the gumbo and this was the best I have had since I visited New Orleans in the early 90s.  It had tons of crab, lobster, shrimp and Cajun spice.  EXCELLENT!!!  $24.99 for a large bowl of gumbo . . . hmmmmmmm . . . YES, get it.  The only thing that I disliked was the damned line, but it did seem to move quickly.  The service was pleasant and efficient, but not exceptional.  I would visit again, but this time I would like my wife to come with me - I know she'd LOVE it.",

    "text": "Wow. Pan roast. The line to this place does not lie.. their food is awesome and super fresh. Seeing the pictures of food on this place didn't excite me and the last time I was in Vegas I decided to skip it but this time around since we had time, we decided to chance it even though the line might be long.   We came around 130pm and we still waited about 45 minutes which actually didn't seem as long as it sounded.   I don't know why they don't just expand the place. The food is so good and it's obviously very popular.   I got the palace pan roast (crab,sausage,chicken) and it is so big! Definitely would not be able to finish it by myself. I think next time I'll get the combo pan roast with lobster. I felt the chicken was a waste of stomach space since their seafood tastes so fresh and amazing. We also go the jambalaya which was good but definitely not necessary as the pan roast comes with side of white rice.   I highly recommend coming here. This is probably one of my favorite places I've tried in Vegas!",

The food is cooked right in front of you in small steam boiling pots. My #1 choice is the Combo Pan Roast. It's a tomato cream base w/ crab, lobster and shrimp in it. I usually get between a hotness level of 4-7 depending on who's making it. Oysters are always fresh and good on the half shell. You can get the large beer and get refills for half off. The gumbo is pretty good here too, but I'm bias because I make my own. My BF thinks this place is F'ing Amazing. Note: the one in PALACE Station is the best one to go to",

Oyster Bar is located smack dab in the middle of Palace Station's casino and while having a constant waft of cigarette smoke during your meal isn't the most ideal scenario, the food makes up for what the environment lacks.  We got really lucky. Dropped by around 2pm and waited maybe 20 minutes for a seat. Seating is suuuper limited with what I believe is less than 20 seats. Once we were seated, we were quick to order a half dozen oysters and a combo pan roast.  No lie, these oysters were the best I've ever had. Sizable succulent morsels that were perfectly sweet and salty. I could've eaten a dozen of those alone! Luckily my boyfriend doesn't eat oysters so I had them all to myself.  The pan roast was also perfect. Perfectly spiced, perfect amount of seafood (generous portion of lobster meat), and perfect service size too. It satisfied every tastebud that Ritter's couldn't.  Worth the wait! Counting down the days until I can come back.",

No bueno on a tummy full of leftover alcohol. NEVER. EVER. This left my last memory of this place a little tainted to say the least.   I didn't return for a while, but finally made the effort when I saw they changed to being open 24 hours. Nothing like a big pot of goodness anytime of the day (or night)!  Came here after clubbing and even though it was 5AM, there was a wait! Seats are first come, first serve and after that you wait in line until one of the 20 seats are free. My party of 3 ended up waiting about 30 - 40 minutes.  Two words of advice: COME. HUNGRY.   Their portions are so large, they're almost 3 meals in one! And there's a fee if you share with someone. I'm not really down for that, but once you try one bite, you might want the whole bowl to yourself!  Definitely come here and get the pan roast! There is nothing else you should order! All kinds of fresh seafood sauteed with brandy, cream and tomato and served with rice. SO. FREAKING. DELICIOUS. And they don't skimp on the seafood at all! You can see the cook dump in the goodness in your pot and cook it right in front of you! You can even pick what level of spiciness you want. You can pick anywhere from 1 to 10. Level 3 is good for a light kick, but you can still taste the flavor of the sauce.   I know there's a lot of options for 24 hour late night eats in Vegas, but this is one of the better ones out there. I mean, any place with a wait at almost every hour of the day is definitely good eats!",

And because it's open 24 HRS, there are times I have seriously considered jumping in my car in the middle of the night and driving all the way to Vegas (I'm in the OC, a 4 hr drive away) to indulge in their Alaskan chowder.  I haven't done it yet, but just wait, one of these days, I definitely will.  Only downside is how dinky this place is (a counter with only 15 seats or so) and there is always a wait and the line moves so slowly.  But it's definitely worth it, even though it's torture to see all the diners tucking in to their dishes right in front of you.  Pan roast is pretty good here but I'm not a big fan of jasmine rice, I wish they served it with either Uncle Ben's or a short grain (yes, I know I am very picky when it comes to rice).  I have yet to try the gumbo, will have to give it a whirl the next time I'm in town.",

We decided based on our usual server Steve's recommendation of bouillabaise ($21.99) It had a good soup base and plenty of seafood including crab, lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and cod. Pretty solid as far as bouillabaise goes.  We got our usual oysters to go and it was past midnight and they were doing $3.50 Bloody Marys so I got one. Pretty solid and spicy how I like!   Next time we ended up with   Little neck clam steamers ($15.99)- good, but standard. Broth butter was good though  Alaskan Chower ($17.99) New England style with crab, lobster, and shrimp. It is very thick so we poured a little of our clam broth in it and that made a more preferred consistency for me. If you don't want it as gloopy as for some of the seafood broth into it and I think the garlic, parsley, butter enhanced it. Definitely one of my favorites.   We normally go around the same time at night so it's been always Steve and Ricardo who take care of us and it's been good service every time. The BF and I somehow have magical timing as the last 3 times we haven't had to wait at all for a chair!!   Still one of my favorite places and we're planning to try down all that's on the menu.",

My friend was telling us this was a must-have in vegas and we were a little skeptical because of the location...   Anyways, after some drinking and gambling at the $5 tables at palace station, we waited a little and sat down at the oyster bar around 3am.    I'll cut to the chase, the combo pan roast was SOOO BOMB!!  Fresh oysters were pretty good too.  Only downside was the wait for the food.  We waited almost 1 hour after we sat down and ordered to get our food.  One buddy who was pretty drunk made it up until about 5 minutes before the food came, then he disappeared to the bathroom for the rest of the night.  Really sucked for him because the food was amazing!  Fast forward to the next night.  After drinking/gambling on the strip, we found ourselves at the oyster bar again, this time around 6am.  No wait to sit down and a little less of a wait to get our food.  Again, combo pan roast was $$$$$$$$!  I'm definitely coming back here every time I'm in vegas!  Just gotta remember to bring some tums for the heartburn lol...",

    "text": "As noted by all of the other reviews,  there WILL BE a wait as this place has only 18 seats and a limited number of cooking kettles, but your tastebuds will be so delighted that the wait will be well worth it! Upon approaching the Oyster Bar inside the Palace Station Casino you could smell the cajun spices and heat in the air.. just follow your nose! Fortunately there were only 3 people in front of us at 4pm on a Wed, so we only waited approx 15-20 mind for seats. Upon sitting down you can see the authentic kettles and masses of incredible seafood being prepared deftly by one chef. Lobster, crab, mussels, clam, brandy, garlic - ever delicious Cajun ingredient being expertly boiled, simmered, seasoned and prepared to perfection. I have only had seafood as flavorful as this on my one trip to New Orleans. Though we didn't have the oysters, they were being shucked right in front of us and they looked SO incredible! Huge and plump and looking so fresh, we will definitely be ordering a dozen to share next time!  I had the combo pan roast level 6 of spiciness and JJ, the chef that prepared our food, cooked and spiced it to perfection.  It definitely had a kick and every piece of seafood was cooked perfectly - lobster, shrimp and crab. My girlfriend had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo and it was spicy, brothy, and delicious. The pasta seemed very fresh and drank in the smoky, spicy broth amazingly.  The portions were huge and we left with enough food to eat for at least a meal or two later.  If you aren't grumpy hungry and are willing to wait a little while for genuine flavors and quality this is the place to go!",

We waited about 30 minutes for 4 people, but they mentioned at night it gets super crazy.  Probably all the drunks hungry people come in.  The server we had was really nice and was working her ass off and did her very best to refill our drinks.  I got the pan roast like everyone recommends, and it did not disappoint.  Large chunks of seafood inside.  Its like a cajun safood bisque if I had to call it something and they include a scoop of rice.  I heard they charge you more for extra rice, some of my other friends went and got a bunch of scoops for free.  The 1 plate alone of pan roast is very filling and they ask you the spice level on a 1-10 scale.  I got a 2 since i'm weak sauce but my friends got 5.  They are convinced they were all the same spice level since the guy makes the food in front of you and it look like he used the same amt in all of our dishes.  I think they all tasted very similar as well.  There are also oysters there which I did not try, but looked good.  Seems the pan roast was by far more popular than getting oysters on the half shell.   Loved the food, will make this a new must go to place every time I go to vegas!",

The host recommended the Palace Pan Roast and Bouillabaisse. We love seafood and were already planning on the pan roast because of the reviews. Coming here was the best food decision we made during this trip - both were beyond amazing. We don't like things too spicy so we each got a level 2 which turned out great...a 3 probably would've been fine too. Flavor is phenomenal, especially the pan roast. How we had never come to Oyster Bar on any of our countless previous Vegas trips, I don't know. But coming here for the pan roast at least once is going to be a must for every Vegas trip from now on!",

This is also why I'd never care to eat a cronut.  Didn't get a chance to try their \"magical\" pan roast and, frankly, I don't care if I ever do. You kind of wonder if all the rave reviews are actually due to delusions which are a result of hunger.

I took the fire level up to a 5 (1-10) and it was very good, next time I will go a 2 or 3. First time I have had this served with rice, interesting, but very good! The oysters on the half shell? I almost fell out of my seat! They were large and super fresh and yummy! This was a second attempt to eat here. The first time we had 5 in our group, this time just 2. So the bummer is, it really is just a bar, a small bar, maybe 20 seats in a half round. I love watching the chef prepare food, it is just cool. The waitress was super nice and attentive, the food was amazing! I'm from S.F so sea food is my thing and this place rocks. Yes the casino is old and smokey, don't care, the food trumps it. Parking was easy peesy (I did mention it is in a casino).. No reservations, might have to wait in a line, looking on and feeling growing stomach pains. I wish this were a tad bit bigger, not the best for a group (if you all want to eat at the same time) a single or 2 ppl is your best bet.. I will be back!",

Both times I have eaten here, I've arrived at about 2 am on a weekday and only had a 30 minute maximum wait, not as bad as I expected. I ordered the Dozen Oysters and Shrimp Linguini, to die FOR! I'm a chicken when it comes to spicy, so I ordered my pasta with a 0 Spice level, haha, I loved the funny look the cook gave me when I did. The sauce in the pasta was the best I've ever had, creamy and rich. So glad I gave this place a second (and 3rd) chance, will be returning again and again!  Original Review, 2/15/2015, 1 star: Came here under the impression that this establishment was open 24/7, since that is what they claim. Arrived at around 2am, and after waiting for over 10 minutes and getting ignored by the chef and hostess, I made my way to sit at the bar. The chef then very rudely informs us that they were closed and just waiting for the people that were eating to leave! Why couldn't they say that when they saw me standing there, instead of ignoring me.",

    "text": "\"Good things come to those who wait\"  I feel like that is the underlying theme of this location. Luckily I had read countless reviews, so I was prepared for a wait, hoping that it would indeed be worth the wait.  I got in line at 5:40 PM on a Sunday evening, and I was seated at 6:27 PM, so the wait was actually not near as bad as I was planning for. I could see how this would be a bigger issue for large groups. My suggestion would be to seat everyone solo or in small groups and move closer together once other guests leave.  Once seated, I started with a half dozen oysters, which came out promptly. They were easily the biggest oysters I've ever had before in my life! This was good and bad for me - in that I'm not used to having a mouthful when eating oysters and it was a little much for me. Not sure I'd order again, but I was glad I tried them.  From there, I went with the House Gumbo and the Combo Pan Roast, as they seemed to be the popular choices and you can only order 2 entrees (to be fair to those waiting in line).  I started with the gumbo first and was blown away! I haven't had gumbo that good since I was in New Orleans! It was incredible! As good as the gumbo was, I think the pan roast may have been even better! If I could only pick one (or didn't want to spend $50 to get both) then I would go with the pan roast - assuming that I  wasn't there to satisfy a gumbo craving ;)  Ok, now to address the heat of the food! I typically like really spicy food, but the reviews made it sound like anything over 6 was suicide! I originally went with a 7, but after talking with a regular sitting next to me, went down to a 6 to be safe. At a 6, I barely noticed it was spicy, so I think I would have been fine going with a 7 or higher. If you are the type that can handle hot/Indian heat at an Indian/Thai restaurant, or can handle the hottest wings at BWW, then you will be just fine. I know I have a fairly high tolerance to heat, but I think even my wife would have been fine with a 6, and she typically goes much more mild than I do.  So all in all, I completely agree with the other reviews in the fact that the food and service definitely warrant the wait! Think of it this way - how many of us have waited over an hour in a theme park for a 2 minute ride?!? At least the end of this line is SO much more rewarding after the wait!",

    "text": "I've heard about this place from friends and after a month, I decided to make it to give it a try on my regular trips to Vegas and I am glad I did.  So the wait is about as horrible as everyone says.  If you go during the busy times, which is anything around regular meal times, expect the wait to be at least 2 hours.  I heard the light times are only around 3am or so.  One time I went at 3pm and it was only 1.5 hours wait.  Yeah, that is considered short during regular times.  Ever since I tried this place, I make sure I go there whenever I am in town.  Onto the main part of the review, the food!  Gumbo - Definitely order the seafood and get extra crab and lobster and sausage, even though the regular portions are generous enough, but I like more food in my gumbo than usual.  I only go for the level 2 or 3 spicy because I have heard some horror stories about how spicy it can get once you go to 4 and beyond.  I think 9 and 10 might just be inedible to most mortals.  It goes very well with the scoop of rice you get, but it can get very filling.  I don't think I have ever finished a whole bowl and I have always had to take home half.  Jambalaya - It's not a soup/stew but rather, a dry rice cooked in Cajun spices and served heaping with seafood.  It's less salty and filling than the gumbo but that doesn't mean I can finish a whole bowl either.  Raw Oysters - Definitely get it.  Their yellow band oysters are some of the biggest I have ever seen.  The oysters are juicy and plump and delicious.  Raw Mussels - While the flavors are saltier and sharper than an oyster, it also has a crunchier texture.  I didn't like it as much as the oysters and I can go either way on this, but I think I would just get more raw oysters instead.  They give you a fresh baked sourdough roll and butter.  I don't even bother eating it because I want to save room for the food.  However, when I did eat it, it was perfectly baked with the crunchy exterior coupled with a soft and warm interior.  I like their wine selection as well, even if it's not that extensive, but you don't need a big complicated wine list when what they have is picked to work with their food anyway.",

From the photos it looks like it's just a small bar next to slot machines--it looked ghetto. And when we got there, it was True, the place Really IS next to slot machines on the main floor of a casino. But it's also True that the food here is worth 5-stars  The price is actually pretty high--almost all items are $20+ and up, so be aware. The quality of the food is well worth it though--extreme comfort food, perfect for after long nights of gambling or other crazy shit you did in Vegas.  Word of caution--the spiciness rating here is insane. You choose spiciness from 1-10, and being a guy that eats spicy stuff everywhere I choose 7. Man was it hot. I think my max for this place is at most a 5.  Basically, whatever you think your spicy rating is, just minus 2 or more from it.  The seafood stew quality was amazing, with HUGE chunks of lobster, fish, clams etc Everything tasted fresh, with seawater freshness inside the flesh even though it's covered in broth. After I ate this meal I was full for the entire 8 hour drive back home. Definitely a bit meal with large portions.  Definitely a place to come back to again and again and again.",

Visit here was unplanned and that's the best thing. Where to eat after an extensive gym work out was such a hard decision until I suggested this popular place. Uber ride wins! It is located inside the Palace Station Hotel and Casino.   Literally,this spot is a BAR that can only hold 16 people. We ordered COMBO PAN ROAST(a must here!) a platter of RAW OYSTERS AND CLAMS WITH ADDED SHRIMP COCKTAIL. We watched our food being prepared and cooked. The chef and the boss were personable. We paired it all with glasses of white wine.   If I ever visit Las Vegas again,I will definitely go back and get the same PAN ROAST over and over again!",

    "text": "I had to go back again after I tried a SoCal knock-off (if you will), and I did it at a far saner hour of the day. Here is the review that I really wanted to write the first time around, including photos.  Oyster Bar: the myth; the legend; the lines. Well, the legend anyway. It's real, and somehow I only had to wait 10 minutes at around 1 pm today because I'd miraculously found a slow time of day. I had had a good feeling going into Palace Station, and when the server/host (awesomely named Christopher) offered me a choice of two seats, I took the one in the middle of the seating arc so that I could be close as possible to the action.  My order again wasn't taken immediately, but I think that's just part of the choreography of this place. It takes time to prepare the food, and most people know that there is a wait to be expected usually. And then there was a literal dance as Christopher and chef Ricardo tried to get around each other when the former was ready to take my order and the latter was moving around the kitchen. I commented wryly that they should keep going, and a good chuckle was had by all.  I asked for the ubiquitous combo pan roast ($23.99) again, but at a spicy level of 4 out of 10 this time. I also closely watched in anticipation of seeing my pan roast actually cooked. It was not a super busy day, so Ricardo at most had to take care of 4 or 5 of the six steam kettles simultaneously. I could have gotten lost in watching him add ingredients step-wise while giving them ample time to cook through, reduce down, etc. were it not for the fairly loud conversations of other customers.  Oh, that and the smells. The brandy was noticeably fragrant as he poured it into my pan roast to reduce, and that was followed by a seafood stock (of sorts) ladled directly from the shellfish boiling pot. Several minutes later came the mixture of dry ingredients and proteins, and toward the end were three heaping ladles of tomato cream. Crab meat was added near the end and allowed to simmer for a couple more minutes. Chef Ricardo finally poured the completed stew into a nice bowl and added a large scoop of rice, and some herbs finished it off..  I was pretty excited by this point and eagerly dug in as best as I could without burning my mouth. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweetness that I somehow missed the first time here. Fortunately, this was only one flavor in a really rich and delicious nectar of the sea that my fully awake palate was able to enjoy. Worth noting is that the spicy level of 4 was actually not enough to halt me between bites, so it's not a Thai spicy scale that they're using by any means.  The proteins were all fantastic, save for perhaps one poorly cleaned piece of lobster, but the flavors of the pan roast quickly washed away that disagreeable taste. The crab meat had discernible pieces of pincer meat, and the shrimp was plentiful and properly cooked. I most likely saved leftovers just so that I could enjoy a second round, not so much because I was stuffed. Actually, I could have ordered another dish to go easily, and they were somehow so slow on this particular occasion that they agreed to prepare 3 dishes to-go for a customer when their normal limit is 2 per person.  Five stars it is. I'll probably delve into the other riches of Oyster Bar on my next visit, such as a gumbo or etouffee, but the pan roast is indeed a must-try for locals and visitors alike. Just try to go at odd hours during the daytime or else be prepared to endure a lengthy wait.",

So let me start by saying THIS IS THE BEST OYSTER BAR AROUND. Places with similar names like at Harrahs and Hard rock are not the same. Even Oyster bars that are the same company like at Santa Fe and Sunset do not taste as good as the OG spot. The wait here can be long, but just remember there is a reason why. The food here is delicious. When you're in line, you get grump/anxious/frustrates, but all that is forgotten once you sit down. The oysters here are fresh and tasty but what they are really known for is the pan roast. It's a tomato base soup that's rich and creamy. This is probably the best soup I ever tasted and I don't even like tomato soup. Line can be up to 2 hours but I promise you if you never been here it's worth it. This is probably one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in Vegas and I recommend everyone to try it.",

NO WAIT at 8AM!!! Hahahaha!!! If you don't wanna wait go early in the morning 7, 8, 9 am! Lol :)  We decided to share a Palace Pan Roast (shrimp, crab, chicken, and sausage) $23.99... but there was a $5 charge for sharing a plate. You get 2 small bowl of rice for a shared plate. Honestly sharing it was perfectly fine. Their poritions are huge and their pan roast is very heavy so sharing is probably a good idea. We got the spicy level at 6 (up to 10) and it wasn't spicy enough for me... I would have preferred it to be more like an 8. The pan roast was good, I can see why people rave about it so much and I would be back!   I loved it but I cant give it more than 4 stars because of the price. So sharing a Palace Pan Roast was $29 plus a glass of beer plus tax and tip = over $50 for one meal and we shared a dish... That's expensive for what it is...  The service was good! We chatted up with the chef who showed us the difference in tools to open up clams and oysters... and the waitress helped us out with finding the closest grocery store. Everyone was really nice! It was a pleasant meal at 8am! And I am sure I will be back! Definitely check it out if you haven't done so yet!",

Our first night there my Bf got the Gumbo and it was not good. I don't recommend that dish. But the Pan Roast and Bouill Roast are my two fav dishes. The seafood in it tastes so fresh and with the rice it's even more amazing! We also ordered half a dozen of Oysters but it was not good.

Otherwise, they only have like 14 seats or something, so if you come at any other time during the day expect there to be a 30 min - 2 hr wait. Also, don't come with a big party because you will be waiting forever. If that's the case maybe take the trip up to Texas Station casino, or the other one down in Henderson. Their oyster bars are not nearly as good, but they're owned by the same company, have the same recipes and space, with no wait.  At least one order per person.  Again, highly delicious, but a little bit pricy for the local who's used to $10 a plate. If you're from out of town, definitely try it! People come to vegas again and again just to come to this place. You won't be disappointed. Truly a gem off the strip.",

Having gone through it twice now, I'd say waiting about an hour to an hour and a half is all I'd be willing to wait going forward. It's definitely worth it (to me) but time can be precious in Vegas if it's a weekend trip. Plus, each order is cooked to order by one chef so you're waiting a bit more. Don't do that to yourself. If you get in line already hungry, you're already losing.  Pan roast is a must for a first timer if you like seafood and bisques. Rich, creamy, and filling. If you like heat/spice, get a 6-7 at a minimum.   If you're with others, you can wait in line in shifts and gamble or get drinks.   As a patron, once you've finished eating, be a bit mindful of the line you just escaped and the line of hangry folks glaring into your backs. Sitting there checking FB on your phone and other f*ckery isn't cool. There's an entire casino you can go do that in. Get up and save a waiting stomach. By all means, enjoy yourself and your company - just don't be a jerk.",

My friend and I met some nice guys at the club who took us to eat here. They INSISTED that it was the best meal you could get in town, but I was skeptical. First strike- we had to take a cab from the Strip all the way to Palace Station. Second strike- only 16 seats at the counter, so the wait time was over an hour when we arrived around 2 AM.   Fortunately, they never struck out. The wait wasn't too bad since we befriended everyone else around us in line. We ordered 2 dozen raw oysters to share, which seems excessive for 4 people since I only ate 1, but they demolished the rest. I'm just not really a fan of Gulf oysters.  The kitchen is just a couple of stoves behind the bar, so you get to see the entire food prep process. Even after you FINALLY get seated (the gates of heaven have opened), it takes a longgg time to prepare just one dish. My friend and I shared one order of the combo pan roast, and she graciously conceded on the spice level for a spice wimp like me. I'd never had pan roast before, but it's essentially a steaming hot seafood stew with rice, shrimp, crab, and lobster, bathed in a creamy tomato bisque. It was packed with rich flavors, and every bite was as satisfying as the first. If you can get me to shut up during a meal, you know the food's good.  I'd say it's a home run.",

Be prepared to wait 40 min to an hour because it is a bar table and can only seat 8-10. Service is great and very friendly. Best times to come is around 3-4am after hitting the tables. As much as i like going to Vegas, I wish they have place like this in Los Angeles so i can come by anytime i want.",

    "text": "This place was something of a pilgrimage for me. For one thing, I LOVE oysters. If I had my way, there would probably be a severe shortage in the world wide population of the deliciously slurp able critters. I would wage a war with my belly and being able to swipe out a dozen or two at a time; they simple wouldn't stand a chance! Lucky for them that this place often has long lines or I'd be a regular.  The night of my pilgrimage, I recruited a coworker and fellow foodie to join me in braving the long wait.  It ended up taking about an hour and a half to get through the 8 or so people in line before us. Once seated, our server/waitress was a sweet woman named Dolores who had a fun attitude, coping with the onslaught of diners with charm and a quick joke here and there. I ordered a full dozen of oysters to start and we placed orders for 1 combo pan roast and a gumbo. I had the pan roast at a level 7, which wasn't hot at all to me. The flavors in it are what makes it such a winner; it starts warm and sweet, with the flavors of tomato and seafood hitting the palate first. As you eat, other flavors start to build in intensity, bringing the depth of spices,brandy and cream to a complex head. The more you eat, the more flavors jump out at you. It's all the more impressive when you consider that the majority of the cooking is handled by one busy chef at the bar. You can watch the entire process, which includes filling a unique metal dish with the ingredients, then pouring water into it and pulling a lever to dump it right there at the bar. I'm assuming this nifty set up allows them to crank out more dishes without having to waste time hauling dish after dish back to the dishwasher.   The intense, complex medley of flavors in my combo pan roast were excellent and well balanced. I'll order mine spicier next time, but even the lack of heat couldn't detract from how delicious my meal was. It's also enough food to guarantee a lunch worth looking forward to!  The gumbo was also tasty, thick with rice,okra, seafood, flakes of pepper and a viscous brownish-green roux based gravy. It was tasty and my companion enjoyed it immensely.  Admittedly, an hour and a half is a LONG time to wait,which is the reason I hadn't come sooner. The prices may seem high, but I consider it reasonable with how much seafood there is used (we ARE in the desert, after all) and how much hype there is. I intend to come back again for sure, hopefully I'll be able to swing by later on some evening when they (hopefully) aren't so busy,",

But please, have the god damn sympathy on people  so people don't have to feel like dummy n wait in line for 2 hours. My suggestion is to get beeper of some sort to give it to people so they can just go their merry way, gamble, n come back to eat when their beeper vibrate. Also what kind of bullshit system is that you have to wait in line to order take out as well?? Sometimes not all your steamers are used and you can make more money by taking take out order. I love your food and I am a regular but I can only do this so much before I stop coming abd also tell my friends not to come anymore. I know you don't care about one person giving you bad review and it won't make a difference to your business but I don't care. I just want a good service and sometimes I don't even get that at the counter because the server don't care about the customer. Good food can only get you so much. I came from a city where I usually have to wait in line but never get treated like this n it is just bullishit. Also I know food has been taking longer than 25 minutes . I know for a fact that seafood don't take that long to cook. Longer food means longer wait n you get less customers.",

Why do I come to some random Oyster Bar in Palace Station for food in the first place? Well, they serve up gumbo. Not just any gumbo, it's quite possibly the best gumbo in Las Vegas.   I really wish they could close down The Broiler and merge the two, as it was so crowded at this bar but there was no one in there. Just saying. It's also pretty steep, but one bowl of gumbo is more than enough for two people and it's so good anyway so the price is totally worth it. The shrimp are huge, the sausage and okra are plentiful and the peppers are just right. Don't forget to mix in crackers, sourdough bread rolls and loads of rice.   Who would have thought that the best gumbo in all of Vegas would be held in a non-descriptive oyster bar at Palace Station?",

    "text": "I don't what else I can really say to convey the deliciousness of this place except all these raving reviews are not mere exaggerations.  I went to vegas this past memorial day weekend and of all the great things we did in this wonderfully sinful city, eating at this place was one of the most memorable.  In fact, I have the leftovers sitting in my fridge right now and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it ALL DAY.  I seriously cannot wait to go home and eat it.    Their pan roast is one of the most delectable soups I've ever eaten.  The seafood lends an incredible sweetness and savoriness to the amazingly seasoned tomato bisque.  The spices and seasoning are perfectly balanced and create a truly complex flavor that is smooth and rich without being overly potent or creamy.  I would say it is comparable to the specialty soups they serve in fancy glass cups at fine dining restaurants, except you get a whole heaping bowlful for a very decent price.  It's 20 bucks per bowl but that is easily shared among two people.  Although, you definitely won't want to share and just take home the leftovers for yourself.    The seafood is incredibly delicious and fresh both in the soups and by itself.  I don't think I've ever had that quite as good as they were here.    I know the build up for this restaurant is incredibly high and your expectations may seem too great but even if you read mine plus dozens other reviews, you won't be disappointed.  The only reason you may not like it is the wait but trust me when I say it is worth the wait.  Everything is made fresh and the flavor profile of their pan roast is truly unique.    mmmMMmmm......still thinking about that soup in my fridge.",

    "text": "This place is where we go for dinner more than anywhere else in town. Fantastic food and a quirky staff make this an enjoyable evening-plus, the leftovers taste even better the next day!  First of all a few notes:  1. It's in the Palace Station. Yes, it's an old casino. Yes, it's not in the best part of town. Yes, housekeeping could probably use some work. It's not as bright and clean as the picture on their web site. Get over it!  2. It's not a restaurant, it's a bar. It only seats 18 people and there's only 1 chef. You're going to wait in line--maybe up to 2 hours if you're there during rush hour. If you don't want to wait that long, go somewhere else. Don't stand in line and complain about how long you've been waiting!  3. Don't come with a large party and expect to sit together unless other patrons are willing to play musical chairs to help you out.  4. All the roasts and gumbos are cooked to order, take about 10 to 15 minutes, and each party's order is cooked together. There are only 6 roasters. If your party has 3 people and a party that sat down just ahead of you has 4, you do the math. You're going to be waiting.  5. The staff may seem aloof/cocky/arrogant/surly or whatever to you, but they're not. They know their regulars and have most of our orders memorized. They're quite willing to strike up a conversation.  We probably eat here at least once a month. We just love the combo pan roasts. As noted, there's probably going to be a wait in line, so we'll stop here on the way home from work. That way we're getting there about 4 in the afternoon before most folks are ready to go out. It's a bit early for dinner, but we seldom have to wait in line. We also look to see who's cooking. We prefer JJ as our chef because he's always fun to talk to. Bob is another good chef, but we've learned to tone our heat rating down a notch or two when he's on the line.  We'll occasionally start with a dozen oysters that are shucked right at the bar. They're always fresh and with a squeeze of lemon and a bit of cocktail sauce they slide right down. I'll usually have a bowl of New England clam chowder or an order of littleneck clam steamers. Both are very tasty and lead right into the pan roasts. If you've never had a pan roast, it's seafood sauteed in a steam roaster with a brandy, cream and tomato base served with a scoop of rice. It's closer to a thick soup than anything else. We get the combo roast which has shrimp, crab, and lobster. When you order, you tell them how hot you want it on a scale from 1 to 10. Brenda always gets a 5 and I'm usually a 7 or 8. With a 10 you get fresh chopped habaneros on top. You get to watch the food prepared right in front of you and the smell of the seafood and garlic permeates the area. One thing we've learned is that once you get your pan roast, ask for a bowl of horseradish and add a spoonful into the bowl. It doesn't add much more heat to the mix, but it does enhance the flavor.  Station Casinos has tried to duplicate this Oyster Bar in some of their other properties. Sunset Station and Texas Station both have what they call Oyster Bars and the menu is similar, but these are more like regular restaurants. We don't think the food at these is quite as good as at Palace Station and that may be because they're trying to serve so many customers. There is a Tides Oyster Bar at Green Valley Ranch. There used to be one at Santa Fe Station as well. We tried it and the food was terrible. It didn't last a year and the space where it was is still boarded up.  When we go, we'll only eat half the bowl so we can save some for a day or two later. Once all the spices and flavors sit a couple of days together in the fridge, we think the pan roast tastes even better than the day it was made.",

We arrived on a Sunday night just before 7pm and there were only about 10 to 12 people in front of us.  Little did I know how slowly the line moved.  Over 2 hours later at about 9:15pm, we were finally called to be seated at the counter (the only seating there is, enough for about 18 to 20 patrons).  During those 2+ hours, we had the privilege of standing in line in a casino right between noisy slot machines and their busy players club counter, wetting our appetites with the fragrant aroma of cigarette smoke, cheap perfume and the incessant \"bong bong bong\" of slot machines.  By the time I received my combo pan roast (level 6 on the heat), my bad mood, headache and sore feet unfortunately drowned out the absolutely wonderful meal in front of me.    It seems to me that casino-side bar eateries should be fast and efficient.  Unfortunately, this place isn't, simply because of the of how it's laid out.  The type of meals they serve here take much prep, there is only one chef (who is also doing double duty on time consuming oyster shooter plates), there's just 6 roasters, and there is very limited seating.  This place would be wonderful if it was a full-blown restaurant instead of what it is... a strange, misplaced, inefficient food bar.  Would I eat there again?  Hell no, even though it was some of the tastiest food I've had in Vegas.  It's simply not worth the wait.  If you really want to try it, I highly suggest VERY off hours (when we left at 10pm, there was still a long line) and if there are 4 or more people in line, be prepared for a long wait.",

Eventually, all of 8 of us had that chance, at first seated in separation of 3 friends and then joined together when 3 different eaters left their spots at the right time.  30 or so minutes lasted to see our 1 friendly and humorous chef efficiently cooking our orders right in front of us.   On the menu, what actually sparked my attention was that a $5 sharing fee is enforced--so be cautionary for one order to one couple =P.  Keep in mind, though, that many of their bowls are both Super Pho-sized and unsurprisingly diet-hostile.  At the same time the little policy deemed okay to slurp up or sample different dishes of someone else's o_o.  Jayne L & I didn't mind about the sampling part, so for this ordeal, Jayne had dibs on the Palace Pan Roast ($22.99) with rice--you can opt for noodles instead--Michael Y casually went for the Shrimp Scampi ($17.99), and I had to go for my Plan B order, the Alaskan Clam Chowder New England-style ($17.99).  Firstly, my own order was frankly delightful and just-right rich.  Most of my creamy, thick bites spooned up yummy, up to par chunks of lobster, shrimp, and clam.  Aside from the seafood selections, though, I couldn't really sense any other uniqueness to the chowder.  Meanwhile, as far as Michael's order, one of his favorite foods unfortunately destroyed his crush, suspiciously lacking some critical ingredient like wine--so that Scampi's a skip =/.  Finally & positively, Jayne's Pan Roast, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=KFHTGjWRbmRW1YULYj7rLw#dJMdvh6Lpc8HiYlKmNTCpg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/oyst...</a>, was definitely something that I somehow cannot compare with or relate to.  Filled with fluffy rice, tasty and succulent chicken; shrimp; crab; and Andouille sausage, the robustness, richness, complexity (from Brandy the drink, likely) and slight tanginess of the \"soup\" wowed Jayne & me that she didn't mind me scooping up as much until I really called it quits.  Plus, she made her Pan Roast at spicy level 8 (10 being the max), and as a frequent spicy consumer this was addictively hot stuff--not something for those who think jalapenos are scorching.  Obviously you're thinking: worth that line?  Let's see, sure: I thought their prices were reasonable and sound, especially on the Pan Roast.  And would I go again?  If I can have the Pan Roast to myself =P, oh yes.  I just hope, interested eater, that either you end up with the same chef as ours, or the other dude is as skillful ^_^.",

I think next time I'll have a beer and try one of the pasta dishes, when you sit at the bar it can get a little warm from the heat of them cooking, so you really need a ice cold drink.",

I don't know if this opinion is a result of my friends raving and having major foodgasms over this stuff but I wasn't impressed. To be fair, I'm not a fan of creamy food, soups, etc. The seafood portions (I got the combo roast) were hefty and the shrimp and lobster were cooked just right. But the soup was just too creamy and I couldn't eat much of it. Anyway, when I told my friends that it was whatever, they gasped and looked at me like I was spewing heresy. So to each his own I guess!  The experience was cool though. All these hungry pan roast loving people staring at people eating pan roast watching the chef making pan roast in the middle of the casino. It's worth a try!",

    "text": "After hearing about how bombdizzle Oyster Bar is from numerous friends, I hauled my ass over the first chance that I got. And whooo wheee, it's FANTASTIC.   The chefs prepare everything to order and better yet, they prepare it in front of you so you can watch the magic happen!!   For a first timer like me, I went the safe and easy route and ordered a half dozen oysters and the ever popular Combo Pan Roast to share.   Oysters - superbly fresh. Comes with all your usual fixings--chunky horseradish, lemons, marinara sauce, and tobasco sauce (upon request). Prepare to your heart's desire and slurp on up!  Combo Pan Roast - wow, this stuff is like crack. Even when my stomach was telling me, \"No more, I'm stuffed!\", my mouth would keep commanding, \"More!\". The best part of the meal isn't the plethora of seafood (a whole lobster tail, 4 halved crab legs, and a shit ton of shrimp) that crowds the dish, the best part is... wait for it......the broth!! The broth consists of a sweet creamy tomato broth mixed with various savory spices and brandy that will leave your tastebuds feeling a bit perplexed (but in a good way!) from the flavor complexity. My friend and I enjoyed this dish much like you would a curry dish rather than a soup, so we ordered an extra side of rice for it. The dish was large enough to overstuff the both of us.   It's a pricey place overall, but well wort the price imo (and the portions are large so many of the dishes can be split between two people).  And here's the kicker.... all this awesomeness is available 24hrs a day!! So if you're wandering around the strip drunk at 5 am, and you want to get your fancy on.... I suggest you stumble on over to Oyster Bar at the Palace Station for their Pan Roast!",

Sometimes Im not sure which one is mine since there is literally no-stop business here.  The place is literally a bar with very limited seating and there is ALWAYS a line. I went at 2am and had to wait 45 minutes to sit down. It is definitely worth the wait though.  I ordered the pan roast and it is some of the best food I have ever had. The pan roast reminds me of curry and is delicious. Its so good that I am now on a mission to find something similar to it in my hometown (ive been told it will never be as good as the one at Palace Station tho).  Highly recommend everyone tries this place out. Food is good, food is fresh and the line is justified.",

All the chefs have a different range in their spiciness levels and Bob def makes it spicy! Can't go above a level 6 with him! Just a note, this is NOT a full scale restaurant. It's more like a bar with about 16 bar seats. So if you have even 5 people ahead of you, the wait can still be pretty ridiculous. Palace Station needs to just change it's name to Oyster Bar and expand the sitting area!   Btw, I never finish the pan roast and I would NEVER recommend sharing it with anybody because my favorite thing to do is reheating that bad boy later on that day. The spices and flavors deepen so it tastes that much better. Plus you'll regret sharing it when you go home and you're craving it. Last time I was there some guy was taking 7 to go....to check in on an airplane. Now that's love.",

We got there around 830 pm figuring we would beat the dinner rush. We ended up waiting for a whole hour when there was only about 7 people ahead of us! The good thing was that they were pretty quick about getting us our dozen oysters and food. The oysters were delicious, but had a couple pieces of shells stuck to the oyster itself from the shucking.   We ordered our favorite, the Combo Pan Roast...yum! Sharing between the two of us is always more than enough and always always get an extra side of rice. The lady didn't charge us a sharing fee which was extremely nice of her considering that I was getting cranky from the long wait. Overall, if I was starving I don't think I would wait the hour at 8:30 otherwise come really early or really late so that way the wait is cut in half. There is always a wait no matter what, but this just means that this place is that GOOD!",

Limited seating (~16 seats), and only 12 people in line when we first got there.  This being my first time here, I just followed suit. We all got the combo pan roasts (in varying degrees of spiciness), which is one of their most popular dishes. I wanted to try the gumbo, but my friend said it wasn't as good as the pan roast - oh well, next time. Verdict? Excellent! 1 shared between two girls was perfect. We were full and satisfied, and we're big eaters too! The guys, who each had their own pan roast, were in pain for an hour afterwards because they didn't share yet had to eat every last drop because we're Asian. Mwahahaha.  Oysters on the half shell were large and juicy, but not as creamy as I like. The best oysters are still found in the NW, sigh. I didn't care much for the bread but it made for good dipping.  TIP: Ask for the rice on the side if you don't plan to eat it all, otherwise they automatically add it to the roast and because of all the cream sauce, it's hard to differentiate if the leftovers are unnecessary carbs from rice or a tasty piece of seafood you accidentally left behind.",

    "text": "Great food, though super rich... But! The wait is a deal killer. We - literally - waited for nearly THREE  HOURS to sit down. In this old-school casino, that was, frankly, near-torture. The smoke and meandering crowds were *very nearly* not worth the wait.   The oysters were very good, but simply not up to the regular experiences we had in N. CA in the myriad small places right on the water. The pan roast was excellent, though. We did meet several people waiting with us, and they - to the last one - said they love the place, hate the wait, and would recommend coming in the early mornings(!), and decide to take out (you cannot order ahead, though, and you MUST wait, no matter what).  Unless you're in for a less-than-satisfying adventure, or can yank your butt our of bed at 6A to stand in a (shorter) line, just remember: it's only food.",

Just come here before 5, if possible. I've never actually had to wait that long like other reviews say. I try to avoid the rush hours   Food: the combination pan roast is amazing. The first time I tried this, it felt like it wasn't living up the the hype everyone claims, but the second time I realized I was very wrong. This is definitely my favorite dish.  Service: it takes awhile for the food, but they're very friendly. I always enjoy when people cook in front of the customers, definitely adds to the experience.",

    "text": "I was staying at the Palace Station and my friend recommended the Oyster Bar. Now I'm an oyster lover and could live on eating seafood everyday but I had never had a pan roast before! Embarrassing right?! And I have the nerve to call myself a foodie and a Yelp Elite...  I started with the raw oysters, seafood cocktail, and raw clams. Other places usually display these items on a bed of ice as part of the ambiance but instead... they literally just took the frozen shrimp out of a bag that looked like it had been purchased at Costco and then peeled it. The oysters came out of a brown cardboard box before it was shucked and served. Frozen then served... It tasted good though! lol  They have a digital menu on the wall and hand you paper menu's although there is only one thing that you should order here. PAN ROAST!! I knew according to Yelp that I was going to order the combination pan roast but just for kicks, my eyes glanced over the menu and my eyes stopped at the familiar dishes I'd had before, such as gumbo, bouillabaisse, etc. and I ordered a gumbo as well just in case the pan roast was a disappointment.  NO DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!    Even with the frozen seafood, deelish!!!!!  They cook it in front of you and the pan roast was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. It;s like someone had taken all my favorites and put them in a blender to make the base. The sauce was rich, buttery, creamy, flavorful, zesty, delicious. I googled the recipe and will try to make it but if  you had never had it before and want to know what it tastes like, let's put it this way... If I had to describe it and make it with only 3 ingredients, I would use the crab fat of a dungeness crab, the buttery middle of a raw oyster and a tomato. Sounds delish right?  Rich, creamy, buttery delicious goodness.   Ate there 3 days in a row.... No line, no wait, lucky me.   Love love love this place. Only downside is that there is always a line and a wait (except for when I go).   Things to note, average dish is $20+pp which might be pricey for some in a casino bar however portions are huge so you can split it with someone or eat it later that day like I did. I spent about $75 each time I came.   There are only about 6 burners to cook on at one time and about 15 seats or so, so be prepared to spend about an hour there but it's worth it. The end.",

Although there is always a line about lunchtime, you can buy the $0.99 margarita and bide your time talking about what you're going to order. Then you get a seat and order the combo pan roast. Watch Bob do his magic. The Station casinos all have an oyster bar, but this is the smallest and the best. Even the employees come here on their days off! We order double meat and split it. The rice is excellent, and we're rice snobs. The lump crab is terrific as are clams on the half shell (when they have them). I'm a tiny oyster person, so I'm not a fan of the big ones they get here. Don't eat the roll. Save room for your pan roast or gumbo. Another fave is the linguini with clams. Pure and not disguised by cream.",

The hotel/casino is off the strip and is run down in that old Vegas way. We didn't know what to expect of the restaurant (in face we expected a restaurant) however Oyster Bar is actually a bar in the middle of the casino floor. It's open 24 hours a day. We waited for a little bit (made longer by the people in front of us having a party of 5) then were seated at the bar. There are only approximately 20-25 stools but they turn over fast.   We ordered a dozen raw oysters and a combo pan roast. I'll admit, eating raw shellfish in the middle of a smoky casino may have had me fantasizing about my head firmly lodged in the toilet later in the evening but I decided to live large. At the very least, food poisoning will help my bikini body for later.  However, nothing could have been further from the truth! The oysters were epic in size and freshness. The pan roast seafood we cooked in pots right in front of us. The smell alone had me salivating like a Pavlovian experiment! All in all: AWESOME. And the price? We spent $47 for both of us!",

We started off with 2 dozen and moved on from there. I couldn't believe how fresh they were. They were on the tiny size as well, which we love. I hate chewing on a huge oyster forever. These were simply perfection. They came with all the fixings as well. Siracha, horseradish, lemon, cocktail sauce, and lime.  We also tried the gumbo. We ordered the Seafood Gumbo and loved it so much we ordered 2 to take home to have \"second dinner\" I mean, seafood isnt fattening right? RIGHT!? This place is phenom. The staff was extremely polite and made it very fun to dine here. The small bar fits about 15 people. The only problem I had with the Oyster Bar was they need to expand and put one in Summerlin! This place is a must try.",

The oyster bar only has about 16 seats so like all the other reviews point out, expect to wait. We had a party of 7 and we told them we were okay if we had to split up but we got lucky and after only an hour and a half we got seated all together!  Most of us ordered the combo pan roast which was filled with seafood. They definitely don't skimp on the good stuff! It's all made to order and not just one pot that they scoop out of a pan which is the reason for the wait but totally worth it!   I also tried the gumbo which was just okay. I'd stick to the pan roast and might try the chowder next time too.   The raw clams were sooo tasty too!   Portions are huge and prices are a little steep but you have to remember what you're getting, SEAFOOD! It's unfortunate that I could only eat half and had to waste the rest. But I will definitely be back with more friends and family.",

Oysters are super fresh and delicious. The chef shucks them right in front of you. Pan roast is AMAZING. I've had the combo and palace pan roast. I prefer the palace pan roast because you get both seafood and chicken/sausage! I always say that I will share one because it is a huge serving, but end up being a fatty and ordering one for myself, which then turns into awesome leftovers. If you're thinking of coming here for the first time, it's definitely worth trying!",

Just watch out when you pick your spice level. A level 7 had us sweating like crazy. I prefer a level 3-4 that had just a hint of heat to it. My daughter recently had the bouillabaisse and loved it. It has great flavor if you don't mind taking the seafood out of the shell when you eat. I've also had the Alaskan clam chowder that was also good. I still prefer the pan roast.  Gotta love that they are open 24/7. The only downside is that there aren't very many seats so there's always a line to wait in. At least if you go in a group, you can alternate who has to stand in line. It's definitely worth the wait!",

Been hearing about the crazy goodness for a couple of years & now I finally had the time to get here. Luckily I did not have to wait in line because my friends from out of town who insisted on eating this place did the waiting for me. Ahahhaa  They waiting for about an hour & half since we were eating at an awkward time between lunch & dinner on a weekday.  We ordered a DOZEN OYSTERS... SEAFOOD PAN ROAST... ALASKAN CLAM CHOWDER... DIABLO SHRIMP PASTA... JAMBALAYA... & bouillabaise! Reminder that all of these items could be given a spice level and i chose 7 which honestly wasn't that spicy for me.   The OYSTER came with some cocktail sauce & the most delicious HORSERADISH I have i ever tasted. It really had a fresh kick to it as if it was ground right infront of us. The CLAM CHOWDER was another amazement that had lots if clam in every single bite which reminded me of the chowder bowls from the fisherman's warf  in san Francisco.  The server/bartender was quick & she was even nice enough to help the chef makes some oyster shooters once she was done taking care of all the guest. Our chef was extremely funny & interactive with the us. And honestly better than most entertainment places that I have experienced while being served. (Forgot his name but I think he was phillipino or Hawaiian)  All in all i would wait the line again... portions are big for the price & the entertainment of just being able to watch ur food being created front row seat is just AWESOME!! Plus they have Pepsi products ahahha love my mountain dew",

She was so friendly and chatty with her customers, but hello?!!! can you please take our order and then resume with the morning news?!  Still waiting...to...order. Finally, after her local news, she takes our order. YAY! ........................................................................................ 1 dozens of Oysters and Pan Roast, please.  Oysters were really fatty and yea, i like them smaller. These oysters were big-if you like big ones, these are your winning plate.  Pan Roast...so, we ordered and it takes abount 20min for the food to cook. It looked amazing when they are making my bowl....but its not for me. Its for other 5 ppl who ordered it, with different spice level.   We got level 8. Its not that spicy. The pan roast was DELICIOUS; however, i can't eat more than 1/3 because its so rich and buttery and creamy and fatty. I'm lactose-intolerant and I was prepared for this pain and suffering. As soon as i ate 1/3 of it, i died.",

Order to Made, you can see exactly the ingredients the chef put in each other.  The secret base, well that is the main star since it has so much flavor, it marries well with the other ingredients.  An explosion of flavors in your mouth, and beware.... Indicate your spice level before even ordering from this place.  The level of spicy depends on each individuals.

It was intersting that the food was made right in front of us  We got no drink refill, (had to ask twice for my drink in the first place) from the waitress/cashier... the chef actually got us some refills! The chef was really the only reason they get 2 stars intead of 1.  Service is super important in Vegas... I guess they are so popular and have such limited seating... that philosophy goes out the window  Note to those with kids (or to over 18 kids) ..not allowed...it's a BAR..gotta be over 21 to be seated  Combo pan roat was tasty. Crab cakes were just ok. Ceasar salad overpriced and no cheese (at least on mine but I thought I saw another patron with cheese on their salad, again a bad service thing)  Then we waited for the check for over 20 minutes.... that really sucked...not being able to wait anymore, i estimated what the bill would be, added 10% (chef and waitress/cashier share tips) and left",

The long line is due to the limited amount of seats at the bar which only seats 18.  The limited capacity allows for friendly banter with the chef and the rest of the crew much like you would have with a bartender at a bar.  Our waitress was super friendly we even scored a sample of the clam chowder .   It was pretty cool being able to see your meal cooked in front of you.  I ordered the combination pan roast which contains shrimp, lobster and crab.  You can adjust your spice level (1-10) I went with 6 and my friends who ordered 7 and 8 seemed to think that 6 would have been a good level.  We also got the shrimp scampi which was also very good.  Overall I had a great experience with my delicious meal and fun staff.  Hopefully I can return to this place another time at some odd hour when the demand isn't as high.",

Hire more workers for a quicker turnaround. Ive been waiting since 3am and it's been over 2 hours. Huge resentment and so frustrated I'm not sure I can enjoy my food at this point.",

Cons:  -LONG wait if you come during prime times: lunch, dinner, post club. -Cigarette smoke from casino is prevalent, it is an open bar -Because of the cream in the pan roast, can be too rich after a while -Oysters were fresh but not tasty.

We saw soups being made and cooked right in front of us. They looked tasty. When we are asked how spicy we wanted our soup from a 1 to 10 my girlfriend said 8! The chef then said, \" Are you suurrre!\". I'm glad he stopped us. We ended up getting a 6 and it was still nice and spicy.  Of course we got our oysters which were very fresh and clean.

I usually order my own bowl, but honestly, half a portion would be the perfect size for all the major items.

They were big and juicy looking. But When I bit into them it had no taste. Normally oysters will have a burst of ocean flavor.  But these oysters literally tasted like they had been frozen or had lost all their flavor.  Don't let the looks deceive you.   All in all, the experience was ok. The pan roast is a def try. But everything else was mediocre.  Also! The chef is a beast. He single handedly cooks all the pan roasts. He works nonstop and super hard!  Good work!!",

We got there around 3pm (totally not peak hour) and still had to wait an hour. There's only a long wait because the restaurant is bar-like and only has around 17-20 seats. Not only that, the chefs cook your pan roast right in front of you!  We ordered a dozen oysters ($19) and they weren't anything special. I actually prefer oysters elsewhere. The pan roast ($22) comes out in a HUGE bowl. You can definitely share with a friend, but they charge you ~$5 if share. You can order your rice on the side if you don't want it all mixed together. The pan roast is thick, flavorful, and filled with lots of seafood!  I wish we had a seafood place like this in the Bay Area - I love seafood and I love the concept!",

The bar only have about 20 seats, and the lady who worked there told us it's about 3 hour wait no matter when you go... They cook every single dishes individually and everything was full of seafood!! I have never seen that many seafood in one bowl of clam chowder, its nuts... The pan roast was really good as well. Their serving was pretty large, even for an average man.  If you have never been to this place, you should! I recommend going there with a friend or two so people can take turns waiting in the line... Or you might pass out before it's your turn lol",

    "text": "What to say about a place with 2000+ reviews??  First off...I've been 5 times in the last 6 months (I might have a Vegas problem..). I've only eaten here 3 times during those 5 visits. Yes, the lines are long, hence why I've only got a 60% completion rate. But 60% of the time, it's amazing, every time. So, so amazing.  So let's skip to the food...the combo pan roast is worthy of the praise. Seafood bisque with a serious attitude. Huge bowl of goodness. I like the spicy level 7 or 8 and it can get warm but nothing too horrible. Adjust accordingly. Have also enjoyed the oysters...huge and delish.  Truly amazing production team behind the counter. Basically 2 folks. Maybe 3. That's bussing tables, getting drinks. Getting apps. Then one guy cooking for 20 with a few stations all going full boil at all times. How they keep track of everything and keep it straight is beyond me. Never a down moment of time.  Only thing I'd change (which some have mentioned) is the line system. I have no problem waiting for a seat. So that you don't get duped into waiting longer than expected, all parties should be in line. However that's not my call and my only suggestion to make this hallmark even better. Go try this and be patient. It's amazing.",

    "text": "Thank you fellow yelpers. Because of all your reviews and high ratings I was able to find this \"DIAMOND in the rough \" located inside PALACE STATION Casino.   SET UP:  20 seats at the bar. Not good for big parties.  1 chef and 2 waiters.  They are all very friendly, attentive and work FAST.    TID BITS:  -open 24 hours -must be 21 y/o -we waited about 40 minutes @ 5pm.  Wait time varies (obviously). Heard their slow time (if any) was about 3-4pm.   -you can SAMPLE TAP beer before ordering.   ***************THE FOOD GIST*********************  OYSTERS on the half shell: Oysters in the middle of the desert?  How fresh can these babies be?  Well, I can say from my experience they are fresh and BIG.  We saw the waiter cracking these suckers open right in front of us (wearing gloves of course).  He throws out the questionable ones, which was reassuring. AND he threw in a freebie for us.  Very nice.  With cocktail sauce, some lemon and a hint of tabasco.....BAM, you've got yourself a winner!  COMBO PAN ROAST:  $21.99 w/ a $5 split fee ( I think this is waived if you get other dishes...cuz we didn't get charged).   Large portion size; enough to share for 2.  ---HOLY MACARONI. This is one the best dishes have EVER had to date. Tomato cream based creole dish (spice level 5) with lobster, shrimp and crab floating around. Seafood is fresh!!  We got PASTA in the bowl and steamed rice on the side, both went perfectly with the dish.  PLUS, if you want more fun - you can dunk in some bread into the  broth. So, delicious.  ***Spice level 5 is equivalent to medium at Boiling Crab (for us).  It had just the right KICK for us.  Runny nose and all.   FRIED CALAMARI: all variations of the calamari: tentacles & rings.  Good batter w/ a nice crisp.  The marinara sauce was hearty and complemented very well.   *BUMMER Alert:  portion size for pan roast is good for 2 people. It would be nice if they offered a smaller portion, so we can try other dishes (since everything is VERY good).   My new GO TO place in VEGAS.",

    "text": "Oyster Bar is located not too far off strip in the Palace Station Hotel. Let me tell you when they say bar they really mean BAR. There is about 18 counter seats at this tiny tiny tiny \"restaurant.\" (Is is still considered a restaurant if it's literally served on a bar counter??) The nice thing about this setting is that you get to see the chef cook everything in front of you and interact with them as they prepare your meal.   But heed my warning boys and girls, if you have any plans within 4 hours DO NOT EAT HERE. The line is deceptively long.. I came on a Sunday at 6pm (really our mistake for not reading the reviews thoroughly) but we waited in line for nearly 3 hours. And don't get me wrong, this girl is willing to wait 3 hours for delicious food, only this place was ALL HYPE! THE HYPE WAS NOT REAL AT ALL GUYS!   Let me break down our order...  1. Cold Seafood Combo- The best thing in this seafood combo was the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge! The fresh clams were okay, quite difficult to eat but still tasty. But then it came time for the oysters... I can say I am a girl who loves her oysters so I was quite excited to try these oysters and considering this place is called Oyster Bar one would think they served some bomb ass oysters.. but no. These oysters were DISGUSTING. This dish came with 3 oysters and my friend and I could not stomach to finish the last one. They tasted like nothing, but had this really nasty texture to it. UGH I don't even want to think about it.  2. Linguine and clams- This is one of my favorite pasta dishes that is fairly hard to go wrong in my opinion. However, this linguine and clams was over seasoned with basil so the entire dish just tasted like basil.  3. Combo Pan Roast- Despite all the other dishes, I was mainly going to judge this place on the pan roast. It was the most popular item on the menu so I was excited to try it. I would say this might've been the best thing out of everything we ordered but it was still just okay in my opinion. I had a bite of the lobster and it didn't even soak up any of the stew, it just tasted like water..   All in all I would not go back to Oyster Bar because I was quite disappointed. It was a ridiculous wait for mediocre food. Perhaps I went on a bad day. But with 4.5 stars, I don't think a bad day would be this bad..",

Not too creamy and rich like other places which is good. They're not skimpy on toppings either and everything is so big! (Shrimp and crawfish). I prefer getting it with linguini instead of rice because I feel the rice makes it too porridge-y. The spice level is from 1-10 and if you're into spicy, I suggest getting an 8 because I almost cried eating it, but it was still really good.   Oysters: so darn fresh and JUICY!!! You see the chef cut them fresh open right in front of your eyes. Half a dozen for $10! Best oysters I've ever had.  Oyster bar is a definite must when visiting Vegas. Although the wait might be long, I promise you it's well worth. After eating this, places like Ritters doesn't compare!",

I don't play the waiting game anymore, but the fact that I'd fight off my drunken fatigue and drowsiness just to get a bowl of pan roast from Oyster Bar speaks volumes. My girlfriend and I have had it a handful of times now, which is why we don't wait anymore. Still, it pains me to leave Vegas when I don't stop by here.  However, during our most recent trip there wasn't a wait for once! Before this trip, I hadn't had Oyster Bar in probably 2 years. I'll have you know that the food hasn't changed one bit. The taste, quality, freshness, and portions have stayed consistent throughout the years.  My go to is their Palace Pan Roast and add lobster for $8. Sure, it sounds a little pricey, but they give you a good amount of lobster for $8 so it's absolutely worth it.  My girlfriend likes to get the Alaskan Chowder with a side of rice. It's absolutely amazing. Get half New England and half Manhattan. It's the best of both worlds.  I know, I know. I said I would try to keep this review as straightforward as possible, but when the food is this amazing, it's really hard not to get into details. I also said I wouldn't wait anymore, but after our most recent trip, it reminded me of how good it was. I also have yet to explore their other dishes, so I just might tough it out next time to get my fix when I'm back.",

    "text": "Pan roast comboooohhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Open 24 hours!!!!  Steve and the crew take such good care of hungry guests. The bloody Mary is brilliant with a large shrimp dangling off the spicy salted edge like a Cirque preformer. They will ask you how spicy you want your dish from 1-10, I go with a 5-7 depending what I get (pan roast combo always) What's not to love about shrimp, crab, and lobster. I only wish they had scallops too. $1 oysters from 5am to 10am. They serve you Fresh hot sour dough rolls, complete with bowls of butter from the moment you are seated. The cooking show is beautifully done while watching chef juggling 10 jackpots of boiling seafood times to perfection. He pulls a slot machine handle down as the creamy concoction drains into a giant bowl and tops it with a nutty steaming scoop of hot rice. Each chef makes it differently and Eze is my favorite because he sings while cheffing. Ask for the lava sauce for a super hot addition to your bowl of hot LOVE!",

The gumbo is made in front of you in a bar like seating area so you get to watch the chef do his magic while also reading some cool facts on the origination of creole and cajun food. The gumbo is served over rice and a side of bread, the rue is thicker and it's so flavorful. The staff are really hospitable and entertaining the food and service make it worth every penny (about 2,500 pennies).",

The lines can be long and the wait time can take maybe an hour but it so worth the wait. I usually tell my fiance to go gamble and I will call him when I'm seated. The trick to killing time.  Seriously the food is amazing and fresh. I always get the combination pan roast and I highly recommend it. The pan roast is so mouthwatering just thinking about the spices and the creaminess of the dish. It's just perfect. Makes me crave it more and more. I also get the oyster shooters and it's a good starter. Also the Alaskan clam chowder is amazingly fresh and super delicious. Probably the best I've had so far.  Can't wait to go back to Vegas just to come back here. Highly highly recommend this place if you are ever in town. Trust me!! You will not be disappointed. Don't let the long lines scare you away because it is definitely worth the wait. So stop reading the reviews and try it out for yourself. I absolutely know you will love it.",

Bloody Mary's and oysters on the half shell but even if you don't like either of those the Alaskan chowder and the palace pan roast are always my go tos. Every time spot on! Trust me you gotta try this place.  There is only one down fall... there is very limited seating so the wait can get VERY long but hang in there it's worth the wait!   Pro tip.

I've tried other dishes but pan roast is the best (there are different kinds of pan roast depending on what you want in it, what type of seafood, meat, etc) I would recommend trying the combo pan roast or palace pan roast. Pan roast are also served with rice.   Also if you go from 1am-9am, their 1/2 shell half dozen oysters are $10! And their oysters are so good! Do not miss out and make sure you order this deal!   Service, everyone is super friendly and efficient.   Seating is very limited, roughly 15 seats and lines can be long so will the wait time. I've been lucky my past few visits and waited less than 20 minutes each time. However today (holiday) I decided to come here at 12:30am... And didn't get seated until 1:50am... Yes lines were long BUT also..... A couple in front of me suddenly have four friends join them in front of the line when they reached the front. I understand they all don't want to be waiting, but wow really FOUR more people after everyone has waited for over an hour behind them? I totally understand one person saving a spot for ONE/TWO people, but FOUR? Wow I was upset. Please have common courtesy and not do that, because people who actually waited will be upset especially when there's only 15 or less seats.   Other than that, AMAZING place to eat!

Each order is made per person so it does take time, which adds to the wait. Good thing is that it's open 24/7, so I usually go during breakfast before the lunch crowd. Is it weird to eat seafood for breakfast? Maybe. But it's deliciously good and no wait, so I don't care if it's weird to eat this for breakfast.   I usually order combo pan toast, creamy good w a touch of tomato. Husband always order Cioppino.  He said best he ever had. This time I saw there was a boulli- roast, which is a secret menu item before. It's half combo pan base and have boulli base. Creamy and with seafood flavored! Best thing I've had!! I usually can't finish my order, but it was so good, I had to! I've tried many similar restaurants, but this is always the best!",

They are open 24 hours and although they sell oysters, you go there for the creamy, brandy-infused pan roasts, bouillabaisses, and gumbos. There's something for everyone as long as you're at least 21 years of age.   I've never seen not a line: whether mid-day, midnight, or at 2am. You'll have to wait in line. Plan at least an hour wait or beg someone to wait in line for you while you buy them drinks. They never take reservations, but once you've been sat it'll be delicious.   You start with a roll and butter. I recommend the combo pan roast the first time around. You won't regret it. After trying that, feel free to experiment with the \"bouill-roast\" or house etouffee.",

Most parties are on the floor gambling while one-two in their party will wait in line.    **One hour wait.  The wait time can vary but expect to wait one hour or more.  The counter space is limited and the seats don't always turn quick.    With all that being said, the food was phenomenal.  Oysters shucked to order with a simple cocktail sauce.   Lemon for each oyster.    The prawns were jumbo size with a healthy crunch with every bite.    Bouillabaisse was my favorite.  So many different flavors that complimented all the tasty morsels of seafood.     Full to the brim so I just couldn't muster dessert.  More items on the menu I have to try!  There will be a next time for sure!",

    "text": "OK I came here because I had read so much about the Oyster Bar. I got there around 9:15 a.m. on a Sunday and I was probably is 7th person in line and it took 45 minutes to get sat at the bar. Be prepared because a lot of people are saving place in the line, and so you may see only 1 or 2 people ahead of you but they prepared they might have 3 or 4 people with them hanging out somewhere.   After being sat, I order the Combo Pan Roast which had the lobster and shrimp in it. I also ordered, because I'm bringing it back to my room, the Shrimp & Lobster Fra Daviola. In my pictures, you can see I ordered a side of extra lava sauce, if you really like it with some spice or kick to it, I'd order a side that way you can decide whether how much to add or not, make it just right for you.   The combo Pan roast was very good, I think like some other reviewer said there is lobster in it, it was being broken up. Don't expect huge chunks of lobster, it's like a stew.  Of course the shrimp waa good because that is all-in-one piece and it didn't separate.    I thought both dishes were really good, I did like the Shrimp & Lobster Daviola better than the Pan roast. It's because I'm not really a stew kind of person but I wanted to give it a try. I would say it's was not bad,  I would says probably a 4 and a 1/2 but again, I really like my pasta dish better when I brought the home.  They also give you sourdough roles that are round but for some reason and I found I didn't like the taste of the sourdough when dipping into the stew either.   OK the bottom line is , if you really enjoy the Pan roasts, please try this place out. Just remember, there's only 16 seats seated around the bar, so it'll be a wait. You even have to wait if you're ordering take out in the line. Once you get up there you can order your food and walk away and give the seat up to next happy person.",

If you have more than one in your party you can leave one or two people in line while the rest of your party can go gamble to make the time go faster. There's no phone in orders or to go orders so don't try to cheat the system. If you want the food, you shall wait like everyone else. Once you get seated, you can dine in or order to go. Either way, you wait, you get seated, order, enjoy your food anyway you like- no special treatments. Love it!  The first pan roast on the menu is the one to get. You get a bit of everything. The first bite makes you wanting more. Perfect amount of heat, saltiness and thickness of the sauce. The shrimps are huge and the portions are friendly to one's appetite. My friends and I couldn't finish our pan roast so we got it to go which makes a great midnight snack. They packaged it nice and tight with Saran Wrap to prevent any spills so you get every last drop of that goodness.   My friends got the oysters which left them with nothing but smiles. Definitely worth the wait!",

Even if you don't consider yourself the oyster consuming type, this would be a great place to put your pallet to the test. I started off with 1/2 a dozen and quickly turned that into a dozen once I tasted how fresh they come.   The service is great , especially when you're arriving at 8am like we did. We sat down at the empty bar (we heard its never that empty) and were quickly given recommendations. We went with the Combo Pan Roast that comes with shrimp, crab and lobster. I have to say, it is a very rich and thick consistency with large pieces of lobster. The shrimp and crab have for the most part disintegrated into the soup which isn't bad at all because those flavors are all still there. If you're looking for more solid pieces, I would recommend the Bouill-roast. There's a lot of food there and it comes with a side of rice, so you'll leave very full. The flavors reminded me of a creamy seafood tomato soup thickened with heavy cream.   Everything was so yummy and delicious, we wanted to come back a second time but the two hour wait was just a little too long for us in starving conditions. It will definitely be one of my go to Vegas stops.",

We stood in line for about an hour and 10 mins before we got seated. Then it was another 10-15 mins until our combo pan roasts came out.   Ahhh, the pan roast! I've never had anything like it. It's rich, creamy, spicy and so amazing with rice and bread. The portion is quite large so I think sharing is a good idea. I ended up only finishing the seafood inside with quite some broth left.

Service though left a lot be desired unfortunately.   First off, expect a wait as there's always going to be a line. This place is so small and right in the middle of the casino so expect a lot noise and smoke as well. They were so slow seating people down even if there's empty seats around.   We ordered drinks but never got any refills as the guy was basically by himself, busing, hosting, taking orders and processing payments for customers. It was such a madhouse!   Hubby ordered a dozen oysters and was offered only the gold band. I was totally expecting different other options for an oyster bar. But I was blown away by the cioppino! Probably the best I've had by far!   Well as the hubby says, at least we tried it but we would rather stick to that one over by South Point Hotel which I just found out was a sister company of this one. It's just service over there was a far cry from this one.",

We ordered many things but hands down the Pan Roast is the way to go. They have a variation of different seafoods you can order with your Pan Roast from crab, lobster, or combination.   We ordered 2x orders of the Pan Roast combo. (YUM, YUM, YUM)  We also ordered a dozen and a half their raw oysters. Their $1 oysters are from 5am-10am. If you have the energy in your being you should definitely go their during that block of time to get your bang for the buck.   We went at 3pm and we had to wait 45min -1 hour to sit.   Their happy hour special is perfect because there is essentially no line at that time, hence why they offer their best steal at those hours.   We also got an order of their seafood Jambalaya, clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder, and a few of their Bloody Marys. All very good.  Plus, if you mention that it's your birthday they give you a free birthday shot.   The best part was getting to sit right in the front line in this bar style seating arrangement to see how they concoct the delicious meals right in front of you. Super delicious.",

    "text": "Between trips for work and getaways with friends, it'd be fair to say I've been to Vegas a fair amount.  Very fair over the last few years, which is kind of crazy considering how I once went quite a few years in between trips.  Sadly, it's even crazier that it took my so long to make my way to the famed Oyster Bar.  And not just any \"Oyster Bar\", mind you...I mean THE Oyster Bar.  As in, the O.G. inside the Palace Station casino - not the knock offs you'll find sprinkled up and down The Strip!  While the Oyster Bar I visited at Harrah's was nowhere near as good as this one, the two are also different in nearly every way.  That one is a typical sort of restaurant; this one is like an actual bar with twenty-ish counter seats lining the prep/cooking space where you can watch the crew at work (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=x8JFe-PN7d047hMnfcasnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>).  Like their size, the menu here isn't nearly as extensive, but it's far more interesting.  Granted, it could've been my excitement, but literally EVERYTHING looked terrific - oysters, pan roasts, seafood platters, soups, chowders, gumbos, jambalaya, etouffe...the list goes on!  -- OYSTER SHOOTER with Espolon Blanco Tequila...$5 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=LrqXd79gXTvtt1vbXyqZTA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>) After watching them shuck/prep one for the girl next to me, I couldn't help but get one too!  The oyster itself was meaty, the pour of tequila was generous, and the shot as a whole had a spicy bite to it.  Pretty good!  -- COMBO PAN ROAST with Shrimp, Crab, and Lobster in a Creamy Tomato Stew with a Hint of Brandy and Rice...$24.99 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=Dmhz4a5FA06J0tWEjdgIdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>) Despite their name, Oyster Bar's pan roasts are what they're best known for.  Easy to see why - it had a good amount of fresh seafood and the soup/broth was creamy and flavorful (you also choose how spicy you want it).  I'm not always a fan of tomato-based stuff, but this was solid.  -- ALASKAN CHOWDER (served New England, Manhattan, or Dirty Style) with Shrimp, Crab, and Lobster...$24.99 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=8MwHLN918PbNTt62pG0TFw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>) Shout out to my friend for splitting dishes with me - I knew I had to try their pan roast, but this was what I truly wanted!  i generally prefer New England style over Manhattan, but the chowder was truly impressive - more than being rich, this was just straight up delicious!  As so many have already noted before me, the biggest knock on The Oyster Bar is how long the way for seats can be.  Whether it's for brunch, lunch, dinner, mid-day snack, or a late night bite (they're open 24/7), you can count on some sort of wait.  Your best bet?  Get here by 10:00am (on a weekday, if possible), as per my friend who comes here often.  We got in line at around 10:30 on a Thursday and still had to wait about an hour (might have been less if there wasn't four of us).  The other knock, though to a lesser degree, are the prices - chowder for $25?  Kind of hefty...  In the ridiculously likely event that you're going to have to wait, have no fear - the wait will be worth it in the end.  Even though I can't speak for the vast majority of what they have, everything we saw them make looked delicious  What's more, service is great - one server was kind of \"ehh\", but the other guy, as well as the cook/chef, were awesome.  Given the wait and prices though, I'm not 100% sure The Oyster Bar is a five star spot just yet.  I don't know if they're a must visit every time I'm in town, but every other would be almost just as good considering I'm already heading back soon.  FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now...at least until I get an Alaskan Chowder of my own!",

    "text": "Oh, Oyster Bar, we meet again after all these years. By far, the largest oysters I have seen and at $21.99 per dozen, a great deal! Better yet, if you come on weekdays from 5-10AM, the oysters are $1.  My only complaint is the wait. The Oyster Bar seats eighteen people. There were about ten people in front of us and it took two hours for us to be seated. Since there was a group of six people in front of us, we had to wait for six seats to open up adjacent to each other in order to accommodate the group. I just wonder if there's a more efficient way to seat people. We ended up waiting for two hours before being seated. The slow turnover could also be due to the fact that they only have one server who's taking orders, seating people, busing the bar counter, etc.  When we were finally seated, we ordered a dozen of their gold band oysters and the combo pan roast. The oysters were fresh and satisfying, but I did feel like they needed the lemon and cocktail sauce to give it more flavor. On the other hand, the combo pan roast was outstanding! A creamy tomato stew that is so flavorful, comforting, mildly spicy, and with generous bits of shrimp, crab, and lobster.   If you're a big seafood/oyster lover like myself, I highly recommend making the trip over to The Palace Station and indulging yourself in some succulent oysters. My advice would be to go during non-peak hours to avoid the wait and get the best deal, but the food - especially that combo pan roast - is worth the wait any time of day. Every time I go to Vegas, this place is always on my mind. Already looking forward to next time.",

It was so goood!! Ordered the Bouillabaisse, oysters, house gumbo, and alaskan chowder. I wanted to try everything but the dishes are pretty filling.   Would definitely come again.

However, I opted to go around 1pm on a Saturday last weekend because it was too hot for a Beach Club at Encore. Why bake in heat when you can grub on a dozen Oysters and Crab Pan Roast lever 8!   I always get the Combo Pan Roast that comes with Lobster, Shrimp, and Crab with a side of rice, but chose Crab Pan Roast this time and was amazed at how much crab is in this order. You can taste the smokey flavor of the chili that made my mouth salivate even as I'm writing this. Always ask for rice separately since the portion is pretty big, this way, I can take it to-go and eat it later in the hotel.",

They were plump and full of freshness. I always get the pan roast when I am here and by far my favorite is combo pan roast which comes with crab, lobster, and shrimp.  If you're not super hungry you can share this with someone else. Please keep in mind, you must order one item per person.  Since the sitting style is bar style, you are able to see the chefs cook and prepare the food in front of you.",

    "text": "The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think they can improve on their waiting system.   This bar is inside the Palace Station Casino located on the other side of the freeway from the strip. There's about 20 seats and the wait is approximately 1.5 -2 hours. The line runs right in the middle of some of the slot machines but all you can do is watch other people play because you have to hold your place in line. They should hand out pagers and page people when the table is ready. The casino might gain a little by folks playing while waiting. Just have a disclaimer that if they don't show within 5 minutes, their slot is gone.  We went on a Thursday Night around 630pm and was seated around 8-830pm.  What did I eat...  1 dozen of oysters ($21.99) ... big, succulent, and fresh. They were good and if you don't care about the size, these are probably perfect. As for me, I prefer the smaller kind like kumamotos.  1 dozen of clams ($18.99)... must try, super sweet   1/2 dozen Cajun bbq shrimp ($12.99)... this was the best shrimp dish that I have ever had anywhere. The juice that it was cooked and marinated in was bowl licking clean delicious! The shrimp was super fresh and cooked perfectly.   Shrimp cocktail ($12.99) ... honestly, after the clams and Cajun bbq shrimp, the shrimp cocktail was a little boring. For paying the same price, go for the Cajun bbq!  Combo Pan Roast ($24.99) ... it's like a thick seafood stew, tomato base, with shrimp, crab and lobster.  Bouillabaisse ($25.99) shellfish stew with shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels and clams.   The difference between the pan roast and the bouillabaisse is that the roast has all the seafood mixed into the stew whereas the seafood in the bouillabaisse were in big pieces... the clams where still in their shells.   Alaskan Chowder ($24.99), we got it Manhattan style (you can also get it New England or Dirty Style), this was the best chowder ever...seriously!!! In fact, I liked it so much, I order one to go and we had it the next day and it was still the best chowder that I have ever had!   They have four people working and each knew and completed their task well: a gal that served drinks, shuck oysters and clams, and prepares all the cold dishes, a guy that takes the order and cleans the area, another guy that cleaned all the pots and dishes and then you have the Chef that cooked all the hot dishes. Everything is cooked by one man and in front of all the guests. Hats off to the Chef because he would cook 8 dishes at one time and not once did he get anyone's order wrong and everything was cooked perfectly!   Is it worth 2 hours of waiting time... the jury is still out on that one because the food there is really good and I'm so going back to try other things on the menu. How long will I wait ... well, I'm going to try my best to go when it should not be so busy, but most of the regulars there told us it's pretty much a hit-and-miss.",

    "text": "As someone who doesn't like to wait in a long line for food, I have to admit, I'm willing to wait the hour or two for this place. The wait depends on when you come here. If you think coming late at night will help you avoid the crowd, think again! Odd hours like early morning or mid afternoon are actually your best bet. There is a higher chance of a huge crowd around late night or after clubbing.   Service here is fantastic. Everyone is chatty and friendly. It's definitely a cozy bar with about 18 seats. It's probably best to come here in groups of 2-4 and not a huge group. The seating arrangements will make it extremely difficult to have your party seated together and at the same time. But everyone is friendly and will try to make room for your large group so you can try your luck.     As for the food:   Oysters by the dozen - One of the best oysters I've ever had. It's a pretty platter of 12 oysters with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and slices of lemon. Most of the time, very fresh. They chuck them on the spot. There was one time that it was not very fresh when I came around winter time. Other than that one occasion, most of the time, it's absolutely delicious.   Pan Roast Comb- Hands down my absolute favorite! Highly recommended. It's a great combination of cream, tomato, butter, and brandy with generous amount of shrimp, crab, and lobster. Also comes with a scoop of rice.  It's delicious and creamy, with a nice kick of spice. It's been the favorite amongst those I take to eat here.   Bouillabaisse - Broth with generous amount of shrimp, crab leg, lobster, mussels and clams. It's pretty good, but not as good as the pan roast in my opinion.   House Gumbo- I personally don't recommend it. It's a combination of shrimp, crab, and lobster, with Andouille sausage and okra. I ordered this last night and probably won't order this again. It's not that good in my opinion and I would much rather order the pan roast.   New England Clam Chowder - Pretty good. A decent sized bowl with large amount of clam meat. It's nice and creamy, although it can be a bit heavy.   *I think your experience also depends on who is the chef. I wish I remembered who made my pan roast during the summer of last year. It's still the best one. The chef was amazing with his fast efficiency and execution. I was amazed watching him at work. My food came so fast and was sooo good. Then I went a few months ago and it was a different chef. I seriously question if he was hung over. He spilled oil off the sides to so many times and missed spices for so many of the pans. I was frustrated just watching him.",

I notice a lot of regulars come here which says a lot about this restaurant and its great food/customer service.  Highly highly recommend the pan fried.

Took about 1 hour and 15 mins to get seated, then another 45 mins til we finally got our food. The turn around time at the bar was way too slow. 1 chef, 1 waitress, and 2 dish washers in the back. For as busy and delicious as this place is, they should def hire another waitress. Worth it to try the food though. Go in small groups, 2-3 people so you get seated faster.",

I waited about 35 minutes (which I hear isn't that bad).  I had the oysters which were the best I've ever had! Even better than Jersey Shore oysters.   I ordered the palace pan roast. It was amazing! The crab was so good. The andouille sausage was delicious.   The portion was huge!!! And it was only $23 for all of that seafood.   I would absolutely recommend getting that dish.

    "text": "This oyster bar is in Palace Station.  These words came out of my mouth when I first had the pan roast for the first time: \"This is the best thing I've ever had in my life!!\" And it's True!!!  Do not go in big groups, their bar only has about 11 seats and the wait is longgggg. Don't be discouraged, because it's so worth the wait. You will probably have to wait at least an hour, then another 30 mins for your food to be ready.   Onto the food.. I've had the combo pan roast here and let me tell you..... it's not like anything you've ever tasted before! I don't even know how to describe it, you just have to find out for yourself. IDK what they put in here but it's so good an addicting! they do not skimp on the seafood as well. You can see your pan roast being made in front of you, then you think that one is for you...getting all excited...then the chef passes it to the other end of of the bar -____-. I hate when that happens!!!  The clam chowder here is really good as well. The clam flavor is very pungent and they don't skimp on the clams. This is premade already so it'll come out fast, get this and share if you're starving, which i'm sure you are after hours of waiting.   They opened one here in OC, Ritter's but it DOES NOT compare at all. If you want the real stuff, go here!!!",

The only real downside is that it's just a small counter that seats maybe 10 people max at a time, so the line is always super long (an hour roughly). It's fun watching the chef make the dishes right in front of you and seeing how everything is cooked. Probably not great to see all the butter that goes into the dishes, but they taste sooo good. Definitely recommend stopping here once on any Vegas trip and putting up with the wait just to at least try it out once in your life.",

This place is located inside the old Palace Station Casino off the strip. its been popular among the locals, but words have spread over the years and many out of towners will still come and wait in line for this hidden gem in the dessert. They have also changed the hours to 24hrs a few years back, so you can come to have a bowl of this tasty creole food anytime of the day. Sitting is limited to the bar counter and we found out you do have to be 21 & over to be served.",

I ordered the oysters, pan roast, and clam linguini. The oysters were decent but not the best things on the menu. On the other hand, the pan roast and clam linguini were glorious! They are made to order and you can choose how spicy you want the dishes on a scale of 1-10. I ordered the pan roast with spicy level 8 and the clam linguini was a 6. The level 8 was pretty spicy (I was sweating and it made my nose run) but so good when eaten with the rice and bread. Next time I go, I'm planning to try the gumbo!  The place is a gem located on the casino floor, and it's comprised of a long bar that only seats about 18 people at a time. So it's an intimate setting where you get to know your neighbors/fellow diners and the chef. Everyone who works here is friendly and fun.

I love that everything is cooked right in front of you and it seems so simple.  I highly recommend the pan roast and the chowder.

    "text": "As if I needed another reason to come here and enjoy some good soup. The scenery here at times can be sketchy at best and that's not due to alcohol and whatever else floats your inner-child's balloon. I love a good show before dinner to make the experience of dining with your gal even better. Especially when the \"show\" comes free of charge;) Not that I'm a cheapskate, but more money in my pocket equals more fun.  Anyhow, I saw an elderly man in a mobile-chair at the ticket redemption booth next to the service counter as I waited in the perennial looong line here. I don't know what it is about elderly people that always draws my attention to them. It never fails! So the gentleman who finishes his transaction, proceeds to reverse and smash into a heavy file cabinet some 25 feet away. That was enough room to fit two OLDS-mobiles (pardon the pun) side by side. Initially holding my breath because I thought maybe he was hurt? Negative. Old man hits drive! Still processing what I just seen, I was starting to see the humor in it. I never expected what happened next. One of the attendants at the service desk was LHAO!! And not only that but she was doing it in front of him as he stopped in front of her. I thought that was very odd considering she was talking to him and laughing at him at the same time. So she made me laugh! The conversation between them seemed as though they knew each other very well. With tears of utter joy, I proceeded to tell her that was the funniest thing I saw but that I felt bad for him. Sort of. As she gave me a high-five in accordance of the situation; all the while she was still \"moved\". She explained to me that he always does that. The day before he knocked a trash can over that was also very avoidable. And another cabinet on the other side as well. Let's just say he's come into more \"contact\" with things/people in this casino than any manager/PR person working here. Truly the best free show I've seen in this casino PERIOD! Did I mention the elderly man has also been \"pulled-over\" in here for speeding a few times. Priceless. Well thank you to the attendant for filling me in on Mr. Andretti and his antics here at the Palace Station, Peace!!",

It's located inside an old hotel off the strip and fairly easy to locate once inside. We arrived at 4:20PM on a Sunday afternoon In hopes of no wait. Boy were we wrong. 7 other parties before us and there was about 14 seats total  which were all taken. We ended up waiting an hour and 40 mins to just be seated. I passed the time by playing penny slots and won cab ride $$ for the trip back to our hotel! By the time we were seated we knew exactly what we wanted- Palace Pan Roast and the chowder. It was interesting to see how the pan roast and gumbos were made. It took about another 25 mins for our pan roast to be made. By this time, we had 15 mins to eat and head back to our hotel to grab our luggage and head to the airport. Totally worth the cooking wait time but I now understand why I've had friends tell me to come at odd hours- the wait is excruciatingly long with only one chef doing everything!!!",

    "text": "This place if definitely \"a diamond in the rough.\"  Yes, you have get leave the glitz of the Strip, overlook the atmosphere of this old local hotel/casino, and possibly wait in line to up to an hour but its WORTH IT.  This is the only place in Vegas I'm willing to leave the strip for a meal when I'm there visiting.  So belly up to their 18 seater oyster bar in the middle of the casino and just try it!  As others have said their fresh oysters are good but unfortunately the last time I was there they weren't as sweet as others I've had.  But you MUST try their Pan Roast and Gumbo.  But if you have to choose only one then try their Pan Roast it's amazing!  I can't find anything like it anywhere else.  It's a hearty stew like dish with your choice of crab, oyster, shrimp, or combo (crab, shrimp, lobster) in a tomato cream sauce with a kick.  Depending on your spice level you can choose from 1-10.  My bf and I usualy go 6-7 and that's about a medium.  And their portions are huge and they don't skimp on the seafood either. We usually order one pan roast and an appetizer and we're stuffed.  Trust me it's enough, we're pretty big eaters.  When we first tried this place we ordered one pan roast and one gumbo then had a ton of leftovers enough for dinner.  It also comes with rice so you can soak up all that creamy spicy goodness... YUM!!!  So if you're in Vegas and wanna try something different get in the car head over there, you won't be disappointed.",

The line was about 12 people deep when we got there, and it was 3pm.  We planned on getting a snack before a late dinner.  We waited 2 HOURS to be seated!  I had the crab pan roast, and it was amazing.  Requested 6 spicy (on scale of 1 to 10), and t comes with one scoop of rice.  I personally hate waiting in line for food, but it was worth it.  Beware, the line doesnt look long, but 6 people in line probably means an hour wait.  They cook the food upon order, and it takes almost 30 minutes for them to make it.  And the portions are big, so it takes a long time to finish it.  Highly recommended.",

My cousin had a dozen oysters and I had the small clams. He said the oysters were delicious and fresh, my clams were also very good, however I probably wouldn't order these again. The clams are $17, and I think for what you get not worth quite that much. But that's the only partial negative mark. We both had the combo pan roast which has sausage, shrimp, and chicken I believe, this comes in a thick soup or broth with rice. Think of something very similar to gumbo. You order it with a spice level, we both had a 7. Normally I like spicy food but 7 was pretty challenging to me, if I were to do it over again I would do a 5. The main reason for me is it was tough for me at times to truly enjoy it while battling spice. You can always add Tabasco or hot sauce which they have on the counter. My cousin said this is the type of food he would be expecting to eat in new Orleans, but this was way better than what he had in the French quarter. I can't wait for my next visit back!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were out shopping and both were not hungry for dinner quite yet.  I suggested we go over to Palace Station and get in this famous line we've heard so much about so that by the time we are hungry we are being sat at this oyster bar.  We went on Sunday around 5pm, and the line ended up being a 40-minute wait which a random guy told us was the shortest he has heard the line to be.  (He said he has eaten at Oyster Bar about ten times.)  While my boyfriend waited in line I ended up gambling away $20 at a machine nearby so the 40-minutes went by fast for me!  When we were sat we were promptly served our drink order and each a bread roll.  I couldn't tell if it was sourdough but it might have been.  I am not someone familiar with New Orleans-style food so some of the items on the menu I had never heard of and can't tell you much about- like etouffe, bouillabase?  Sorry if those are misspelt- those are just examples of some of the items I am ignorant to.  I had also never heard of a \"pan roast\" before but on yelp everyone seemed to be recommending it.  My boyfriend and I ended up sharing a combo panroast (shrimp, crab and lobster) as well as steamed clams, and I had a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was the first item I was served.  Very good!  I liked how many clams it had in it and had a very white-wine taste.  Not too salty or too potato-y.  The chef made the steamed clams right in front of us.  Seemed very simple and was good.  Had butter, water I think? with some parsley and scallions or other herbs with garlic and white wine.  I had some roll left to dip in the clear broth and liked that almost better then the clams.  The pan roast I was worried if it came with rice or if I was supposed to order that separately?  I had not asked but it ended up coming with rice.  Pan roast was good- I had never had anything like it before.  You see the chef make that right in front of you too.  It was basically the seafood in an orange cream sauce with rice in it.  It was kind of like a stew.  Not too expensive here for what you are getting and the service was outstanding.  I asked if I should tip the chef too, but the server told me they all pool tips so I just tipped them extra because they were all very friendly and even seemed to just be having fun amongst themselves.  That chef really did not stop the entire time we were there.  I have never seen many people work that hard making about six dishes at a time that all came out perfect, based on the fact that many people at the bar were telling him how amazing their food was.  The chef told a lot of people thank you and that he appreciated them.  It just made for a nice atmosphere to be at.  Word of advice if you are a small girl like me is to being a jacket when you come to eat here.  The casino wasn't overly cold but the fans that pull up the cooking steams kind of blow on you and made me very cold!  I definitely wished I had brought a long sleeve shirt with me- it wouldn't make sense because it is 100 plus outside, but if I had known about the fans I would have been more comfortable.  I hope that helps you ladies!",

The food is good and portions are big enough where 2 people can share one order. I just wanted to mention this for the loyal yelpers here. I mentioned to the waitress that my wife and I were going to share one order of cioppino ($20.99). The cioppino was served in one big bowl with 2 bowls of rice on the side. Now, when we ate at the oyster bar in sunset station months ago, i ordered the exact same dish but the cook was kind enough to give two small bowls of cioppino topped with a scoop of rice. I was like, \"Ok whatever.\" BUT when I looked at our bill, they charged us a $5 split plate charge of which the waitress did not tell us about. And by the way, there was no split plate charge at sunset station.",

So far, we have been very lucky and a most of the suggestions have been awesome. The Oyster Bar at Palace Station was one of those great suggestions.  Be prepared to wait in line, it is a small setup in the middle of the casino and can seat about 10 to 12 people. There is usually one cook behind the \"bar\" and one additional server. There are no reservations but you will find a line. From what we hear, there is always a line and after our visit we understand why.  We had a chance to try a few things off their menu and cannot wait to try more on our next visit. The oysters and clams on the half shell are super fresh and shucked to order right in front of you. Their clam chowder is solid, very creamy and hearty. The main courses were unreal. We had the Palace Shrimp Pan Roast and the Etouffee. Both had generous helpings of seafood with very distinctive flavors, and can be ordered at the heat level that best suits you. We ordered a six on the heat level, which can go as high as 10. We like hot and this was almost perfect but I think we will do a 7 the next time. But be careful, the heat level is serious.  The service was really good, more relaxing than I expected. The cook kept us entertained while he prepared our entrees. If you head to Las Vegas, make sure you check this place out.",

The seafood is fresh, it's all made in front of you, and their dishes are nice sized portions chock-full of seafood.  The pan roast, the gumbo, and the bouillabaisse were all amazing. AMAZING. This was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in my life, no lie. And I'm usually a harsh critic.  Unless you come late at night, prepare to wait, there is minimal seating and only one cook. I came at midnight and still had to wait 20-30 minutes.",

    "text": "i just had a 2.5 hour dinner here, and the 1.5 hr i spent was waiting in a crazy \"short but slow\" line! It's all because there are only 20 seats max., it's really like the size of a bar. and usually when you wait for that long in line, you will take ur time and slowly enjoy your food, talk and chill afterwards to make ur waiting time worthwhile.   I would've left because there's really nothing much around, it's in a casino called Palace Station that i've never heard of before, away from the strip, and it's a super tiny place that you can easily skip if you don't see the line. Good thing they're open 24 hrs now, waiting for 1.5 hrs wasn't too bad cuz you still see more people waiting for another hr behind you and telling you that it's soo worth the wait.   i guess they're right, i dun think it's really \"to die for\" but i think it's a very good experience, nice and fresh food made to order infront of you. Service was also very good, it was worth the wait.   After debating on wat to order, we went with the house gumbo and combo pan roast, which both have very similar ingredients (lobster, crab, and shrimp). The difference between all these dishes is the sauce/soup. The pan roast is much creamier and sweeter. the gumbo is more salty and it has a strong taste of cajun/creole flavor. They are both served with a scoop of white rice. We got both at level 5 of spiciness which is like medium spicy, but i didn't think it was spicy at all, should've went with a 7 or something.   i personally liked the house gumbo better even though most other reviews recommended the pan roast. i thought the pan roast was a little too creamy and heavy for me, it almost made me wanna throw up. despite that, the food was really good. You see everything that they put in the pot, so u know exactly what you're putting in ur stomach. The quality of the seafood are really good, shrimps were big, crab meat flooded in the soup, and you can actually see the chunks of lobster. if you're a seafood lover, you'll love this place.   I would definitely come back here again, but next time i'll probably order a cioppino. Overall everything is good here, only that if i am a health freak, i wouldn't eat here because you see everything that they put in the pot. My eyes popped when i saw that \"BIG\" chuck of gumbo base that they put in each pot, it was seriously bigger than my fist. But if not, just pretend u didn't see anything and enjoy the delicious food.",

    "text": "Not impressed...  I waited in line for over 2 hours hoping the long wait would be worth it.  Unfortunately I was disappointed (and this was even after drinking 2-3 beers while standing in line!!!).  When my bf and I were finally seated, we ordered more beer, a dozen oysters, a cesar salad, and the gumbo.  I won't rate the beer because it's kind of a given (haha).  The oysters were good- well prepared, fresh, and came out promptly.  I know I can't expect much for a salad from a seafood establishment but the salad was pretty salty and not very fresh.  Plus it was kind of pricey for just lettuce and croutons!  It's cool you see your gumbo or soup made in front of you since you sit at the bar.  However, I wasn't impressed with the gumbo itself.  I know traditional gumbos add file powder to thicken it and it can be a little bitter, but our gumbo was very much on the bitter side (if that makes sense).  Although it's maybe not a far comparison, I much prefer the gumbo at Emeril's Fish House at the MGM.  Again, unfortunately this experience wasn't what I had hoped especially after seeing all the great yelp reviews.  Maybe I was just cranky I had to wait so long!",

When you're in Las Vegas, it's hard to imagine that you would want to come out to this place, wait in this line, to drop $30-$40/person for a meal because there are SO MANY places to eat.  I really can't tell you why I'm so addicted to this place, except that the food really is quite delicious.  If you're reading the reviews, you already know there will be a line.  Just accept it.  There are only so many seats, and everything is cooked fresh, so what can they do?  Come when you're not already starving, or else you'll just get very grouchy.  In fact, come at odd hours if possible.  My personal favorite is the pan roast.  I never get sick of it.  It's flavorful, the seafood is so fresh, and the heat makes everything feels better.  This last time around I also tried the clam chowder, and it's just as delicious as the pan roast, except the flavor does not have the sweetness that the pan roast has.  So if you're not into sweet flavors in your food, the clam chowder might be a good choice for you.",

    "text": "I talk about the pan roast when I'm nowhere near Las Vegas.   It's literally a top five meal in my life.  Palace Station is out of the way, yes (a 10-minute drive from the Strip), and while it's a decent casino, there's probably no other reason for me to go here, except for that pan roast.  There will be a wait, and it most likely be long.  Even in the early afternoon hours, post-midnight, most anytime of day really at this 24 hour bar will see a full seating of patrons.  There's typically just two folks behind the counter, the cook and the host, who cleans and seats and takes orders.  Even though there will be open seats on occasion, they know when they have the bandwidth to take on new people.  So stand tight, and just wait the agonizing wait.  Once you get seated, enjoy the sparse but tasty menu.  There's a lot of interesting seafood stews - gumbos, jambalayas, etoufee.  Someday, I might try them.  But I quickly fall into the same order - dozen oysters and combo pan roast (shrimp, crab and lobster).  The oysters are generally huge and whet the appetite.  The pan roast (0-10 in heat, I get the 2), full of seafood, is creamy and rich, which can be cut through with a scoop full of rice on the side.  Be warned that it comes piping, mouth scalding hot.  It always looks like it is too much food, but I can't bear to see any part of this stew not eaten.  Then I leave Vegas, and think about the next time I can have it again.",

The average wait time is anywhere from 25-40 mins to be seated. Fyi the bar only sits 20 people at a time.  Food rating is gosh damn amazing!! The oysters are fresh and cracked open in front of you. The menu is simple from chicken crab shrimp lobster choice gumbo/pasta. Beware of the hotness scale 1-10 10 being hot ass shit! So go with a 4-6 for starters.  Price is fair $13.99-26.00 but you get a well worth paid meal but expect to wait for 20 mins to get served.  Best part open 24-7 but always busy, so come early evening into early morning.",

Holy crap was the oysters shitty!  We could not believe how dirty the oysters were! They did not take the liberty to rinse or scrub the oysters shells before prying them open.  I do not think they were fresh! We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.  It was already hard enough trying to eat the dirty oysters..after eating the bad one we noticed the couple others didn't look good.  The worker at the end never took our plate away until the end asking if we were going to finish it.. yeah we just said no.  There's something wrong there if we did not finish it buddy!  We watched them open the oysters after and saw how dirty the shells were and noticed that the shells had bands around them to keep the oysters from opening.  THIS PLACE IS NOT KNOWN FOR THE OYSTERS!  We also had New England Clam Chowder and Chicken Gumbo.  These came out a lot better.  I've never had Gumbo but my boyfriend said it was decently good.  I am a fan of clam chowder, and it was good, nothing amazing.  So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.  The service, it was mehhh.  I swear the cook in front of us looked miserable, took some time for us to have a server attend to us the couple times we needed something..  Definitely will not be back..",

Cons:  - Must be 21+ to be served; although this was not a problem for my group. - Price for most items on the menu is a bit high; but you are in Las Vegas, money is just a number. - Beer selection could be better.  - Long wait during weekends; the place only seats about 15 at a time. - Food takes a while to prepare; but it's totally worth waiting for.  Tip: Come during weekdays if you can, so you can avoid the wait. Share the dishes, the portions aren't small. Pick 5 on the 1-10 level of spice.   Bottom Line: The Oyster Bar in Palace Station is  A MUST, especially if you're not into seafood buffet (1.5 hour wait). Come here, you won't be disappointed. I've been here numerous times and have never been let down. The portions are pretty big, so if you're not too hungry, share! Order anything on the menu, they're all delicious. Just don't make it over the top spicy.",

The only thing I wish they still had was the lavage, because it goes so well with the roast. Now they just give you a plain roll. The only other station casino that has lavage is the oyster bar at sunset station which is my second favorite oyster bar in town. It's probably best to go late at night at night which I usually do, since there most likely will be a line. The smell will keep you waiting as long as it takes though.

Contrary to one of the other reviews, I wouldn't say that the entrees come in \"extra large pho\" bowls--that is, not if you have ever eaten pho in San Gabriel Valley or Westminster.  I'd say it's about the same size of an average pho bowl (which, when filled to the brim with gumbo, a seafood roast, or jambalaya, is still a lot of food).  The Combo Pan Roast seemed to be really popular, and is actually soupy and gumbo-like but a light orange color.  We didn't order it because it sounded like stir-fry seafood or something.  It looked awesome though.  Some cons: 1 hour wait!  At 2pm!  There seems to be no way to predict when the line will miraculously get shorter for the coveted 20 seats at the bar.    Some pros: lots of cheap slots to bide your time!  And despite the wait, once you're up there, the service is great.",

Oyster Bar is a tiny bar by the casino inside the Palace Hotel. (a ghetto hotel off the strip).

Food is delicious and authentic!   I never knew New Orleans food can taste this good!  The hot sizzling seafood gumbo is cooked right in front of you with freshest seafood, ingredients and lots of wine!  I also love their clam chowder, which is very rich w/ a lot of clams.   The raw oysters and clams are good too, but i like their steamed mussels and clams even more.

Had the clam chowder also, it was okay have had better, but the gumbo is worth 10 stars.  Don't let the wait or the  waitress quickly tossing your bread plate on the counter distract you from this food experience.   Once seated, they let you enjoy your food.  No rush to get up for the next patrons.  I liked that.  Went around 12 pm Friday afternoon, about an hour wait.",

    "text": "If you didn't get the idea from the 200+ user reviews raving about this place, then yes, the Oyster Bar is delicious. \"How delicious,\" you ask? \"Very delicious,\" I say. When a place has me ogling over a pan roast more than a celebrity crush, it really means something (Actually, that might just mean that I'm a glutton. Never mind that though).   Since there are already boatloads of praise from other wonderful Yelpers, I'll try not to be redundant. Thus, I'll leave you with a summation of tips, from one glutton to another: 1. First visit? Order a pan roast. It's practically their signature item. Ordering other items could leave you happy, but not as happy as a pan roast would make you. You do like to be happy, don't you? 2. Starving? Order a platter of fresh oysters too. They're some of the freshest oysters that I've had in Vegas. 3. Pro-tip? Get an extra roll with your pan roast to use as a shoveling tool. Extras are free. You just have to ask for them. 4. Pro-pro-tip? Friday and Saturday nights are their peak hours. You could be standing in line for 30 minutes to an hour. I've heard that it's gotten as long as 2.5 hours at the most busy of times. On a early Sunday afternoon, I got seated with a group of 4 instantly. 5. Want to go there now? Call me. It's a date.",

It's a seafood bisque with choice of lobster, crab, shrimp or combo (all 3). Also, your choice of spicy/hotness from 1 to 10. I like the combo #5. Go off lunch and dinner hours or be standing in a long line. Now that they are open 24 hours, I like to go for brunch around 10 am... no lines and it holds me over until dinner. Seafood lovers know Pan Roast at Oyster Bar!!!",

I have long legs, so I needed the front row! Anyhow, that turned out to be a great decision! They ended up being great people and we chopped it up the whole plane ride there. I convinced them to try sushi for the first time, and they convinced me to try out Oyster Bar @ Palace Station for the first time. I hope they enjoyed sushi as much as I enjoyed my meal at Oyster Bar!  Our oyster appetizers were delicious! Icy cold fresh oysters, cleanly shucked, with plenty of horseradish, cocktail sauce, vinegar, lemons, and tabasco. The meal was just as delicious. I had the Cioppino. Real good sauce, big serving of seafood, seasoned just right. They ask you on a scale of 1-10 for your desired hotness level. 7 was just right. A friend of mine who must have defective taste buds ordered a level 10 Bullounaise w/ Habanero and said it was \"just right\". The rest of our party had Gumbo, and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal. My only gripe was... There was only one mussel per dish! I love mussels! And they're probably one of the cheapest seafood out there. Why only one???! Anyways, another bite of the delicious sauce, and I forgot about it.   This place opens late, I forgot the exact times, but I remember still seeing folks waiting in line after my meal was done at around 10pm.   Anyway, if you're the couple from Berkeley that recommended me this place - Thanks!!! Hope you had a good experience with sushi! =b Send me a message!   Oh, and can someone review the pan roast? Nobody from our party had it, nor did we see anyone order it. But it sounds good!",

I felt like my blood pressure doubled from salt, my cholesterol soared from the cream/shellfish concoction, and I gained 2 lbs just during my lunch...  Anyway as said befor the oysters aren't great... I go to pj Clark's in the forum shops to get my oyster fix during their happy hour.  We got the chowder which was good.. The combo pan roast and the jambalaya. The jambalaya was like a salt fest woah!!. The combo pan roast was the best but super heavy!! Maybe because I'm not familiar with new Orleans cooking but I don't understand why it's called a pan roast when the jambalaya seemed to be cooked in the same fashion but wasn't considered a pan roast...  The cooking contraption is interesting. I have never seen anything like that... Seems to have like steam going through pipes to cook the food.  The chef is a busy guy!!",

It's called the Oyster Bar and it really is just a bar so if you go looking for an actual restuarant...you'll miss it.  The bar seats maybe 10-12 folks and there is always a line (you'll smell why when you get there).  I had the combo pan roast with shimp, crab and lobster in this tomato based sauce that was just so delicious i wanted to lick the bowl.  They cook your meal in these steaming pots right in front of you.  They only have 6 pots so that's why it takes a while to get your food....but it it worth every second!!!  A  cant wait to go back!",

They lose a star for poor line management and being slow to clean up when a guest left. It wouldn't be an issue if they had more than 18 seats. I was lucky because i was by myself and was able to pass up about 6 groups of two who were ahead of me when they finally did seat people at seats that were open for almost 10 minutes and had one seat left open. I was almost done before they were all seated and two seats next to me were open over 5 minutes before they were filled. I guess you can do whatever you want  always a line and good food. I think I would hire a busboy to keep everything clean and new guests constantly filling empty seats.",

    "text": "Quite a few of my friends have been raving about the Oyster Bar for over a year now but I never had the opportunity to check it out until a couple of weeks ago on a trip out to Vegas.    The Oyster Bar is exactly as it sounds - a small, unassuming bar inside the Palace Station.  We lucked out as the wait wasn't too long.  The service was here was friendly and prompt once we were seated.    For starters we ordered oysters on the half shell which were pretty good.  We also ordered the bloody mary oyster shooters which were also pretty tasty - and they didn't skimp on the vodka. It's really a good thing that we ordered these starters because our entrees took quite some time to cook.  My boyfriend and I shared the clam chowder and a combination pan roast with lobster, clams, shrimp, crab and chicken.  We probably should have opted out of the chicken because it didn't taste quite right as part of the combination.  The pan roast was pretty good and I can understand why people rave about it.  However, the pan roast at the Oyster Bar didn't quite blow my taste buds away as it did at The Boiler in Chino Hills.  Also, we ordered our pan roast at a spicy level of 5 and there was barely a kick to it which, in my opinion, makes all the difference.  Overall, the Oyster Bar still makes for a great pit stop on a Vegas trip. It would probably be a great hangover meal...hmmmmm.   Price per person: $30 - 40 depending on if you're ordering oysters or other starters.",

So when you show up you do have to wait in a designated line to sit down.(and its worth it!) You get to the bar and its basically the kitchen so you can see everything that is happening. They promptly take you drink order, when you are ready to order they are ready. And then they make it right in front of you. I ordered the oysters on a half shell and they hand pick the oysters and crack them open in front of you. If the Oyster isn't big enough, they toss it. One of my oysters had a baby on its back and as she was cracking it open she gave us the baby one to try it out before our order came. The shooters were greats too. I asked for my really spicy and they didn't disappoint :)   Must go to the Palace Station oyster Bar! It's right off the strip but worth the extra trip!",

Unique creole flavors you won't find just about anywhere else.    All the praise for the food here is accurate.  So I won't waste keystrokes typing about that.  Very seldom do I reward 5 stars to places that come with an hour wait.  But with Oyster Bar, It's worth the wait.  5 Stars and bravo to you!  You also earn the coveted \"eat everything here\" award.  Eat everything here people!",

    "text": "This review that I am writing is fresher than fresh. I have just endured a vegas weekend complete with drinking, clubbing, eating, and more eating. With that said, my highlight of the trip was visiting the Oyster Bar. The palace station casino is a bit away from the strip and isn't anything special, but the oyster bar was something.  We waited in line for about 20 minutes and then go to sit down. There are probably 15 seats at a time so the wait can be very long at times. I ordered the pan roast combo and damn, it was made in front of my eyes and made me feel so good inside.  I never knew that a bowl of this could be so filling and so damn delicious. Bob, the chef at the time, was freaking funny as heck. He's very nice and engaging and I found out that he is Billy Cundiff's cousin (the same kicker for the baltimore ravens who just missed against the patriots today). We were eating and watching the game with Bob as he was fixing up some good meals  For about 20 dollars, I think this was by far the best meal I have eaten during this vegas trip. The sauce is just right, the oysters are good, and everything is just bomb.  5 stars!  Whenever you are in vegas, please hit this place up. There is nothing better to cure your hangover than some of this pan roast.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best restaurants in Vegas!  People are always surprised when we take them here because it's inside a casino off the strip in Palace Station. I would say it is a hidden gem if the wait weren't so long every single time.  Must-Have Foods: In general, the portions are huge, so I would recommend sharing unless you are really hungry. -Cioppino: Bursting with flavor tomato stew with prawns and lots of spices. Absolutely delicious! -Pan Roast: The house special. Lobster, shrimp, & crab in a rich cream based broth. It is very filling but so worth the stomach space. -Steamed Clams: I could drink the white wine and herb broth it is so good. -Oysters on the Half Shell: Fresh oysters served with cocktail sauce. Simple & fresh.    Wait: The wait is at least 30 minutes on a good day so get there early. Even if you have to wait over an hour, it's totally worth it. If the wait is really long, the Mexican restaurant next door sells huge yummy margaritas that always makes the wait seem shorter. ;)    Atmosphere: Once you're seated, you can chat with the chefs and watch them cook. They call it \"live action cooking\" - yes, Vegas terminology. Since you're sitting next to strangers, you're bound to chat it up with other loyal customers. Overall, it's a casual, fun and friendly place.  Service: The service could be better. There is usually 1-2 waiters for the entire bar that serves 25-30 guests and they take their sweet time. The food is so though good that the service is forgiveable.",

The place is located South of The Strip and very much a ghetto area. If you can't handle the wait or crowd, then order to-go!  I wasn't a fan of the oysters but I highly recommend any of their entree; it's absolutely worth every penny! You can pay extra for splitting your dish with someone, but I'd rather have leftovers. The ingredients are fresh and it's cooked right in front of you. The spices and sauce will leave you mesmerized.",

The way she described it didn't sound very appealing, and against my will I came here.  Once we got there I found there were only 10-12 seats, its only counter seating, no tables.  We had a group of 4, so it was kinda hard to wait for 4 adjacent spots to be available.  Eventually we sat, ordered, and once the food came... WOW!!  I must say it was absolutely delicious!!  We each ordered our own, but the portions were large enough to share for 2.  Ended up taking the left overs home, they packed it very well, and it was just as good many hours later.  The chef has a dry sense of humor, but overall a nice guy.  The service was top notch for what you would expect at a counter-top seated \"restaurant\" in the casino... Needless to say, I've been dying to go back!",

    "text": "Came here on a late Friday night (technically Saturday morning) around 2:30 AM and had to wait about an hour to an hour thirty. Let me start by saying the wait was worth it. We had some guy in line that kept hyping this place up by saying, \"it's the best\" and \"worth the wait\" which was hilarious because there was probably 10 or so people behind us and they waited as long as us. It's crazy to think that a line of 10 people would take over an hour to wait for, but we finally realized the reasoning behind it. The food is made right on the spot with one main chef and one waiter who handles all the operations and helps with the occasional shucking. Anyways, once seated, I decided on getting the combination pan roast (4/10 spice) and splitting a dozen oysters. After that's taken care of, they start you off with some warm bread which was pretty good, nothing special. Then we get to see our chef (Ricardo) begin shucking the oysters and clams. When he was popping open the oysters, man I could not believe my eyes at how big and fresh they were. Hands down, the best raw oysters I have ever eaten in my life. Ricardo then began schooling us on how the pan roast is made and the other things he was making for customers. One of the pots he was working on, a customer ordered a 10/10 spicy level and boy did it look like fire compared to ours. The first bite of the pan roast was breath taking. The guy in line that kept saying it's worth the wait, looked over at us and was like, \"what'd I say\". He was right, the best thing ever. The pan roast is so huge, I would recommend sharing so that you do not waste this heavenly goodness. Ricardo also made us a clam chowder that was really good. Didn't have that fishy taste to it at all. The type of chowder that you had to eat while hot because if it gets cold, it's ruined/done. This is the best experience I have ever had in Las Vegas and I would come again. Shout out the the chef Ricardo, handling all that food.",

    "text": "Definitely a gem in Las Vegas! Especially considering it's off the strip and in an old hotel/casino like Palace Station.   There is literally about 20-25 seats so if you do not want to wait, I recommend coming at odd times (non-lunch/dinner hours). I came around 10:30AM and sat down immediately. My friends came at 5PM and sat down immediately as well. If you come during busy hours (lunch/dinner times), you can expect to wait about 1-2 hours.  Definitely get the fresh oysters! It is sooo delicious and they literally shuck 'em in front of ya- so it's definitely fresh. They toss all the bad ones and they're pretty experienced with that.  The pan roast and bouillabaise are extremely delicious. The pan roast has a more creamy sauce with seafood, whereas the bouillabaise has more of a tomato broth with seafood. I must say, it does come with a lot of seafood, I thought it was worth it for the price.   This place is very comparable to The Broiler in Chino Hills (CA), which I really like as well.   For most of the entrees, you can order spiciness from 1-10 (10 being most spicy), and it does get very hot. Usually above a 5 makes it difficult for you to enjoy the meal, but if you have the stomach of steel, by all means, do it! haha  The chef and worker have quite a personality, they can be jokesters and quite entertaining. However, the waittress I had was a little rude... maybe I just caught her on a bad day (which explains why I did not give it a 5 star rating).",

There are only 18 seats that wraps around the oyster bar and there was about 10 people ahead of me that night, which took about 45 mins to an hour before me and my cousin got seated.  We ordered the combo pan roast and a dozen raw oysters and it was heaven in my mouth!!! It was my first time ever trying pan roast, and absolutely the best.  The pan roast was very rich and creamy with plenty of seafood and the raw oysters were nicely shucked and cleaned, plump and a good size.  The wait for the pan roast was quite long, (15-20 mins) for they do make it right there and then and comes with a side of rice, which you should really eat the pan roast with because it really balances out the flavors and tones down the creaminess and saltiness.  The service was quick and fast but not impeccable but I was starving so I didn't pay close attention to it because I was so excited when we were finally being seated lol. Definitely a must visit if you're in Vegas and have plenty of time to spare for the wait is a pain and if you have never tried pan roast before, let this place take your pan roast cherry!",

The pan roast was good. Sort of reminded everyone of a lobster bisque. Although you ate this with rice. We got a spicy level of 4. It's always a gamble with spiciness level. No different here. Couldn't taste any spice with 4 so added some more. Also, more rice. Mmm, yum. Could have used more lobster though.  Now on to the oysters. They were hand cut in front of us although when we got it, there was a worm in one of them. Some sort of parasite. Luckily Grace C. caught it before it went on to live in one of our stomachs for a few years. I think it was the lemon she squirted on the oyster that made the worm react.  When we told the waitress about it, she was really cool saying she wouldn't charge us for them and we wouldn't have to eat them.  If you're ever in Vegas, you should try this place at least once. It really is just a bar so that's part of the reason the lines are so long.",

    "text": "I first went here when my good friend had his 30th birthday in Vegas and made it a point to have one of his meals here. I am so glad he did!  Then I went again when my graduate program was celebrating in Vegas after finishing our comp exam.   The first time, I split a dozen oysters, had the large beer and ordered the combination pan roast (spice level 3; I'm super sensitive to spicy and would sweat up a storm if I went higher than that). The pan roast is seriously one of the best meals I have ever had...and I don't like to overuse hyperbole! Oh and the bread is fantastic as well.  The 2nd time I went with a couple of friends and I was hyping this place up the entire time. I ordered the bouillabaisse and my friends split a combo pan roast. We shared family style. The bouillabaisse was great, but nothing beats the pan roast (see previous paragraph). One of my friends also wanted to try the clam chowder so we ordered that after eating the other things. If you have the room, you HAVE to order the clam chowder. I'm not a chowder connoisseur, but I'm from Norcal and have eaten plenty of chowder in my day (in SF among other places). The chowder here is among the best I've had as well which just cements this place to one of my favorites of all time.   Read on for additional experience/logistical/personal details:  The first time, there were about 8 of us and let me tell you...that is quite a feat to get seated with that large a group here. Luckily we went during lunch and it was relatively not busy. Plus you can get drinks and play some slots while waiting. This casino is definitely not for people looking for the glitz and glamour Vegas has to offer.   Bob, our cook (they cook it right in front of you so you get to interact the entire time) had a straight-forward crude sense of humor, which I appreciate and the waitresses are so friendly and personable. Some of the sweetest ladies work here!  When I first saw this place, I was surprised because the seating was so limited. We all ordered beers from the bar nearby, so waiting wasn't an issue for us. I would definitely recommend going the weekday at an off-peak time (if possible) if you just want to try this place.   Another thing to note is that when you leave this place you have that feeling that 'you're in the know' in Vegas even if you're not a local. I could be way off and sound like a total tourist to actual locals, but that's the perception and feeling (described above) I get when i leave this place. This place is a must visit every time I'm in Vegas.",

Very rich and not much seafood in the dish but was a decent flavor. Also had the clam steamers, bland flavor. Overall based on the wait and taste and price in my opinion I wouldn't recommend or try again.",

We took a cab that cost about $25.00 to the Palace Station Casino, where this little shingle is located.  Skepticism soon crept in as I observed that the \"bar\" sat no more than twenty people at any one time, and the casino interior appear outdated.  Still, we tried the combo pan roast to see what all the fuss was about, after standing on line for about an hour.  Both my gf and I were blown away by the taste of the pan roast.  Even at \"mild\", the food was full of herbs and spices set off a cascade of pleasure pumping neuro chemicals in our brains. Afterwards, we stuck around to play pai gow and two deck blackjack tables with $5.00 minimums.  The card play was extremely fun and definitely changed my view about the Palace Station Casino.",

Tried the gumbo and it was pretty good, not great. But.....the Pan Roast....yup, twas HEAVEN! I personally think the sauce is a mix between lobster bisque, tomato cream soup and creamy pontchartrain sauce. Very heavy but oh so good. Big portions so share or come with an empty stomach. The oysters were super fresh...like...I taste the ocean...in my mouth...type of way. =)   5 Stars for the Pan Roast because I can't seem to find an adequate recipe for it online. Think its a top secret recipe. shrugs. Not to sure if I want to pay random strangers online for the recipe....but I'm tempted. haha",

My husband and I split an order of oysters, New England clam chowder, and  the combo roast pot. The clam chowder was good. The cocktail sauce served with the oysters had an excellent kick. The roast pot was the star of the show. I was tempted to lick my bowl when I was finished.  Service was very friendly, but a bit slow. Due to the bar's small size, there is really only room for a single server, and she was doing it all.   I read a lot of complaints about long waits before going, so I was worried. Thankfully we only waited 10 minutes or so to be seated. We went around Noon today (Monday), just FYI.",

But even at even at 3, 4 or even 5 in the morning, Oyster Bar still has a steady flow of loyal customers that make a pit stop just before going to bed.   On my first night at the Oyster Bar, my boyfriend and I shared the combo pan roast. As I was just about to succumb to sleep, the delectable aroma of the pan roast woke me and the beast inside my belly.  Fresh shrimp, crab and lobster all simmering in a creamy tomato broth... how can that not wake you up?  It was just bite after bite of creamy goodness.  And Steve & Ricardo, who work the night shift, don't skimp out on the meat.  The portions here are huge, even after sharing, we still had leftovers.   On my second night... yes, it was that good that I had to come another night... I had the cup of clam chowder for only $4.99.  The clams were so fresh and had the nice chewy texture that I love. Mhm mhm good!  This is a must try place if you step into Palace Station. It's open 24 hours so there's no excuse for not trying it out! The staff is so funny and friendly. There's a $5 shared plate charge and Steve didn't charge us the $5 for the combo pan roast on the first night.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Food = 3.5 (used to be 5) Waiting Time = -5 Service = 3 Price = 3 Lame rules = -5 Atmosphere = 1 Overall = 0  I found this place years back when I stayed at this hotel and felt sick from a cold and wanted some soup.  That how I found out about this oyster bar with its used-to-be amazing clam chowder.  After that, whenever I had the chance to visit Las Vegas, I always made an effort to stop by this place to eat their clam chowder.  I also discovered some other dishes that were also very good.  I didn't know that this place has gotten so popular and the wait time increases triple the time I used to know about it.  However, after my most recent visit here, I have to say, I have seen all I needed to see.  I won't stop here next time I come to Las Vegas because it's not worth it to me anymore.    So the seats around the bar, that is all the seats there are...approximately 10 seats or so.  There's a line, in which you get to stand on your sorry feet for a few hours until one of those few seats become available.  There is a security guard standing somewhere nearby to make sure that you are over 21 years old in order to be waiting in line.  Anyone who does not look 21 or over get asked to leave.  I was with my husband and my two years old.  We were told that my two years old son cannot be there and that we all must leave because we have a kid.  I asked why and I was told that it's because it is a bar, so nobody under 21 is allowed in there, whether you are in there just for the food, or the alcohol, they DO NOT care.  It appears that the hotel doesn't need to make money on food.  It also appears that the hotel wants you to wait long in lines, so you would get bored from waiting and play their slot machines instead.  Then the service, you finally get seated, and given a menu, then place your order and wait some more, then eat, and then pay and leave.  You get to see the chef making your food in front of your eyes.  How cool right? NOT really.  I don't really care.  I just want my food fast!!! Anyway, chefs here have this rude obnoxious looks on their faces and it's pretty annoying seating here and waiting for the food while having to endure the unpleasant atmosphere...The waitress are all annoying as well.  Prices are in the $20s each dish which is not bad.  Quality of food has gotten worse.  I tried my clam chowder again and this time it was all watery and tasted 80% WORSE than before. I guess they don't care about making GREAT food like they used to.  Decent food seems to suffice given the mass amount of customers that come here.  They seem to not care about customers.  The hotel appears to not care about the money from the food, only the money from the slot machines..  So next time in Vegas, I will NOT stop here.  It's just NOT worth it.",

What you need to know about waiting in line - there are only about 20 seats at the bar.  A single person standing in the line could potentially be holding seats for a total of 6 people - this is what we experienced...  We had maybe 5 people a head of us, which I saw as a reasonable wait...  then the dude infront of us turns into 6 - five people casually walk up and step into the line.  Im not going to sugar coat it... I questioned what they thought they were doing and then generally lost my shit...  our dinner got completely bamboozled by some discourteous dicks and Palace Station allowed it to happen.  We ultimately all sat down at the same time  (because I raised hell), but we had to wait for every one of those clowns to be served before we got anything - dinner took forever...  Manager explained that it is Palace Station policy to let people hold space in line for a total of 6 folks.  I understand for a larger restaurant, but the Oyster Bar has 20 freaking seats... I call bullshit!",

The line forms on the casino floor just steps away from the actual oyster bar. The bar as about 15-20 seats only. At any time this restaurant can only serve this amount of customers. We waited and finally four seats open up in a row. (Thank god) we were all a little on edge after having to stand up and wait for an hour, which literally felt like waiting for a Disneyland ride. (Perhaps seats while guests wait would be appropriate). Although the food was definitely worth the wait! Immediately we were served fresh baked rolls and placed our drink order. I recommend a nice white wine to pair with the seafood. My fiance and I ordered fresh oysters and Alaskan chowder to share. The couple we were with had the pan roast. All of which were amazing! Definitely worth the wait!! 4 stars only for having to stand for over an hour. This place doesn't take reservations. Even if the line looks short you will be waiting awhile!",

I split a crab and lobster panroast (they charge extra to split btw), and it was delicious. I had never had panroast before, but now I'm a fan. The cooks are friendly and you get to watch them prepare your food right in front of you. We also got some fresh oysters here and I am not a fan, but that's because I apparently don't like raw oysters (I had never had them before). Tempted to give this place 4 stars because of the wait, but I enjoyed the food too much to only give it a 4. Too bad they don't have a to-go option.",

    "text": "First off, expect a long wait unless you're coming at weird times like the extremely early morning times. This is a 24 hour joint. There's only about 15 spots for patrons at the bar. During normal hours, expect about a 2 hour wait. Also, this place is definitely not good for large parties, so look elsewhere if you are thinking about that.  The item to get here is most definitely the pan roast. It's a tomato based stew that is cooked right in front of you, as all the soups are, in individual portions and topped over white rice. The stew is hearty and full of flavor. This really hit the spot.  I also had oysters here, as it is the namesake of the bar. I thought they were just okay. Good for Vegas since it's so far from the ocean, but the quality of the oysters is far below those of cities near the sea, such as those I've had in Boston, SF, and Seattle.   Again, get the PAN ROAST!",

Everyone eating them looked like they were in heaven.  We ordered the Combo Roast (lobster, shrimp, crab).  I wasn't sure what to expect when the bowl was placed in front of me but. Holy. Stinkin. Moly. Partyyyyyy in my mouth!!! EXPLOSION of flavor.    The seafood is prepared to perfection in front of you via pan roasting technique and the final stew/soup/bisque (that you patiently wait 20 minutes for as it simmers) is quite possibly one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted.  It's been three days and I'm still thinking about it...Can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can eat this again :P*  Cue ALL delicious food related words! Nomsssss.",

It gets kinda nipply sitting at the bar so don't come in your Vegas uniform, ladies, if you know what I mean~   The pan roast kinda tastes like lobster bisque. The soup base is creamy tomatoey with a little kick.  Yes, I am weaksauce for ordering a measly 4 out of 10 spicy levels but my body can only endure so much abuse in Vegas with the alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, laying out by the pool, and dancing in heels all night. I've gotten pretty lucky with short or no lines in all of my visits.    I will be forever grateful to my coworker, Memo who said this place is a Vegas MUST!    There are $5 tables and penny slots galore if you are waiting in a long line. The raw oysters and bloody mary oyster shooters are also pretty good. Clams are also worth tasting - they have a tougher more rubbery texture compared to oysters though. Bob was The Man behind the magic 4 out of my 5 visits to the Oyster Bar.

    "text": "This is one of Vegas' hidden gems! I totally love this place!!   Open 24 hours, we came here at 2am and waited in line for about 40mins to get seated. This is a bar inside the casino which could accomodate about 20 people max at a time. There's only two people working here, Chef EZ cooking and Steve serving, so expect to wait for your food to be ready. They have the steam kettles in front of you on the bar so you can watch how your food is prepared. Both these guys are so cool! They engage in conversation with you no matter how busy they are and it really makes for a more personal experience.   Food here is AMAZING!! Probably the best oysters I've had, EVER! It's sooooo fresh, chunky, and succulent. I can still taste it in my mouth. Hmmmmmm... For half a dozen, it's normally $11.99 but from 1am-9am, you can get it for $8.99. Score!!  PAN ROAST..what can I say? I'm still dreaming about this dish. I'm already planning my next trip to Vegas for more! Got the Combo Pan Roast which comes with lobster, shrimp, and crab. They're all sauteed with brandy, cream, and tomato then served with rice. You can opt to get the noodles for $1.99 extra which I did. I personally think it's a better match but you can taste and decide for yourself because they serve the rice with it on the side no matter what. It's a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. Serving is big and you'll really see the actual seafood mixed in there. There were about 3 whole lobsters, 7 whole shrimps, and crab meat everywhere on my bowl! I shared this dish and we still had some leftovers.   The Alaskan chowder smelled and looked so delicious!! I\"ll have to try that on my next visit. Can't wait!!!",

I especially like how the chef is able to make all the food in front of us while still carrying fun conversations with everyone at the bar! They seem to remember their regulars as well.  Their pan roast is a must get. It is a creamy blend of different seafood flavors. If you can handle spicy, get a level of 5 or more. I didn't taste any with 5 so next time I will up it! Their clam chowder is also amazing. What stood out the most for me are their oysters!!! They are big, fresh, and so juicy!! I have to come here at least once every time I make a trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "The first piece of advice about the Oyster Bar? Prepare for a wait nearly anytime you come.  (At around 3:30PM though, it wasn't as bad as what I heard around 2AM where my friend waited for 3 hours).  And when you arrive there, you'll see why.  It's a tiny little area with seating only for about 20 people around a literal bar.    Indeed it's open for 24 hours but don't let that fool you either.  The food here is good and everything has spunk/personality.  Some cool notices - the food is prepped right in front of you.  The 'cooks' have a lot of personality.  And it's a great area to people watch such as seeing the regulars come on by.  Finally, they have a lot of late night deals.  Heads-up.  Drinks-wise, they have beer and wine available for around $5-$15 with a decent variety.  They also have oyster shooters in beer/tequila/vodka variants (3 for $10) and they taste delicious of course.  We had the tequila versions.  They also have raw oysters available as well as soups   Along with this comes a number of entrees. They have a number of dishes like jambalaya and some pasta all based on southern dishes.  The real things to focus on, in my opinion is the pan roast and gumbo.  I personally got the palace pan roast which comes with meat and shrimp while my friend got the combo which is basically seafood.  Another friend got house gumbo which came with seafood.  (PS: There is a split charge so just either try to get your individual dish and share if you want to taste or if you really have to - split it.)  The pan roasts were absolutely terrific.  We had them at a spice level of 7 and 8 for both pan roasts and 8 was still doable for those used to spices.  I personally was a bigger fan of the combo as well with the seafood really shining through and having a great taste.  You can also ask for the rice in it to be on the side.  The gumbo wasn't too bad although I personally preferred the creamier pan roast more.  And in the end, the meal was about $70-80 which was a great price for 3 people and a number of drinks/appetizers/main courses.    The wait may not always be worth it; the location far off the strip and the small seating arrangement kind of 'eh' but the meal is one of the better ones in terms of price and taste in Vegas and at least worth one look-see.",

    "text": "I read on yelp that this place has great food so I thought I'd stop by since I was in Vegas. First off there isn't much seating at all, I think it's less than 20 seats. Anyway I went on a cold day so there was a line and I waited an hour half but it was worth it.  My friend and I ordered the fresh dozen oysters and you get to watch them crack it open for you. Then comes the long wait for the good stuff, the seafood gumbo. I gotta say that this was one of my highlights of my trip (and I won $$$ gambling). I haven't tried much gumbo before but I gotta say that this was worth the hype. The sauce is great for the seafood and I know my gf will like this because she doesn't want her seafood tasting too much like \"seafood\". The sauce is a little spicy and they ask how spicy you want it from a scale of 1 to 10, I ordered mine a 4 yet it was still spicy so keep that in mind.  Overall I'm impressed by how one dish makes this place popular. The seafood gumbo is now a \"must have\" whenever I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is A MUST when visiting Vegas.  I always try to have at least one meal here when I go to Vegas.  It's off the strip but well worth the drive or taxi.    I almost always order the Pan Roast with sausage.  It's the best!  It has seafood for seafood lovers and also for those that don't like seafood, you can get chicken and or sausage.  The sauce is creamy and buttery.  I'm not sure how much cream or butter they put in it, but they make each bowl fresh.  It's cooked in the steam kettle that takes about 20-30 mins to make.  It's worth the long wait, even 2 hours when I go at peak time.  I think there are only 11 seats so I wouldn't recommend for a large group.    Go at odd times to eliminate the long wait and small groups are recommended.    I usually like the smaller oysters but theirs were pretty large but were very fresh.  If you're not a huge fan of large raw oysters, don't get them, save your stomach for the pan roast.   Their portions are pretty big so sharing is a good option or left overs for the next day is always good. They will happily pack it up for you and even give you another bowl of rice.    Service is pretty good so I'll always return for my pan roast.",

    "text": "I never would have ventured to Palace station, let alone Oyster bar had my school not set me up to stay the weekend here for a school/work thing. But my fate was in good hands. Our first night at Palace station we wandered the hotel to see what goodies it had to offer. I noticed the small, but crowded Oyster bar and the corresponding line. Checked it out on Yelp, and decided I would have a meal here before the weekend was over.   On my last day, the bf and I had the pleasure of dining here. We shared a combo pan roast and had a half dozen oysters. Oysters were shucked in front of our very eyes and were delicious, fresh, and succulent. There is a decent wait for the pan roast which explains the constant line here. Each order is individually cooked (or should I say roasted) in this contraption thingy. I don't have a better explanation for what that thing is so you'll just have to come and see it for yourself! It is a very entertaining process to watch. The pan roast had a mix of seafood and has a tomato-bisque-like taste, but think more creamy, more melt-in-your-mouth goodness. One bowl was more than enough for sharing. Although I may have been seen licking my bowl at the end, and that's only because I couldn't get enough.   Our waitress was delightful and pretty comical. She suggested an extra scoop of rice since we were sharing the pan roast, an excellent suggestion on her part. I'll have to remember to come here again the next time I'm in Vegas since it is a bit off the beaten path. I really just wanted to use that phrase. Well really this is a good 10-15 minutes west of the strip, definitely a cab ride or short drive away from an excellent meal!",

Then, we waited for another half an hour for the food to come out after ordering. As I was waiting in line to be seated, I saw that they do takeout. I went up to the counter to order takeout, and was told that I still needed to wait in the same line as the seating line to do takeout. If that's the case, what's the sense in doing takeout, you're waiting the same amount of time.  Almost everyone I know loves their pan roast. It was mediocre at best for me. I ordered the Lobster Pan Roast.  You get to pick the spiciness level from 1 to 10. I chose level four and it wasn't spicy at all. It came in a creamy tomato broth, which was really tasty. However, the seafood is not fresh as stated. I could tell from the texture of the lobster that it was frozen before being prepared. On top of that, I only got a few pieces of lobster, not worth the $21.99 I paid for it. It was interesting to see them prepare the food in front of you. They have these metal pots that they cook the food in. First, they cook the seafood. Then, they pour in the cooking wine. Last, they put in the sauce.  My husband doesn't like seafood, so he ordered the Caesar salad. It was a large plate and the greens were fresh. I really liked the salad.   The workers here were really nice. They didn't have a sense of urgency, though. They knew the line was long, and took their sweet time bussing the dishes and seating the people. They didn't really care if people left.",

We ordered the 2 dozens of raw oysters, combo pan roast with lobster, crab, & shrimp, seafood jambalaya, shrimp linguine, and their clam chowder. The raw oysters were good and it tasted really fresh. Their pain roast is AMAZING. (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)   Note: - There's only 18 seating per time and it's at the bar. - The bar right next door sells super cheap drinks so you can kill time. - Try a bit of everything if you're planning to go with a group of 4+ so you can taste a bit of everything.

Standing in a line behind 14 people took just a bit over 1.5 hours at around 11am on a Saturday. Note: its open 24/7.   Service was decent and semi-quick in bussing the bar to ensure patrons get seated as quickly as possible. I noticed one cook, one busser/server, another coming to the bar here and there from the back.  I decided on a dozen oysters $20 and combo pan roast $23.99. A bread roll is also served upon seating.  Pan Roast with white rice- creamy tomato stew with shrimp crab and lobster. This was shared between two people and we got 2 servings of rice at no extra charge. Ordered at a level 7 spice, and it had a kick, but not overwhelmingly spicy. At first bite, you get so much flavor. Creamy, buttery, at times chunky. Good amount of seafood added. Overall absolutely delicious. Oysters - big, firm, slippery. Good for the price and as a starter.  Hot sauce tray available in between every couple of seats.   There's only about 6-8 kettles, so there can be a wait even when you sit. It's about a ten minute cooking time, so it's not that bad. I was pleased by this visit, despite the long waiting time. Might as well have a drink while you wait in line. Enjoy!",

Clams on the half shell took me back to my New York City days. Walking down to the Fulton Fish Market where the local kids from the Lower Eastside worked after school. These clams came all the way from Florida and every bit worth the money. To taste the ocean from one morsel of mollusk. Wow!  The House Gumbo with extra okra and level 4 of heat was more than enough for this Paratrooper to handle.   My wife ordered the BBQ/Spicy Shrimp- so much flavor banging on some big SQWIMPS!

I normally always stay on the strip but was recommended to go to this off the strip local favorite. The hotel itself was nice but nothing to rival the beautiful strip hotels. I give it 3/5. We walked back to the bar and I was surprised it was an actual bar. It seats only 18-20 at a time. We waited 45 minutes with others to finally be seated. While waiting I asked several patrons and found that the Pan Roast and Gumbo were the fan favorites. Once seated we waited another 30-40 minutes for our meal. The deco is minimal and the service is a 7/10. Although they were very nice it was a bar and not fine dining after all. But this is were things got interesting, I ordered the crab, shrimp and lobster Pan Roast add sausage. It arrived and it was steaming hot, creamy and delicious. The large chucks of shrimp, lobster and crab were shocking.  The rich creamy, tomato sauce provides a stew like base to suspend the chunks of seafood. I had mine served over rice. It was delicious and very filling. I recommend getting one and sharing it with a friend or taking it home for lunch the next day. So here's the take....if you want a delicious meal and don't mind eating at a bar with fair service then this place is for you. As a foodie I'd rather have mediocre service and decor but delicious food than the other way around. I highly recommend this place and plan to stay by on every trip to Vegas. It's that good!  I new favorite!",

It has four different types of meats; sausage, shrimp, lobster, and crab. There are different levels of spice 1-10, one being not spicy and ten being spiciest. I got a level 5 and it was perfect. Overall this place was exceptional. Can't wait to try the pan roasted lobster ;)",

This time, I was invited here with my friends to do hood rat stuff. We met at the oyster bar, and luckily I was late running on Black people's time because the wait was about and hour and a half. Mind you, people have to stand there and wait. Once seated we ordered a few entries and a few beers (I'm the sober one)My salad and soup came before everyone else's dish. I was half way done before their food came. Taste was weird because they add horseradish to the salad, but I still ate it. The vibe was cool, basically in a smokey casino full of drunk people...we live in Vegas, so you gotta be use to that by now. May return one day, who knows.",

    "text": "It's very understandable why there is always long wait after my first visit. They are literally for bar seating which only have 18 seats. I have waited for about 100 minutes for two seats. My husband and I ordered half dozen of oyster, an New England clam chowder and a kettle seafood pot soup. The oyster came right after because they prepare it in front of us but the clam chowder took about 20 minutes to come. Meanwhile, they cook the seafood pot in front of the customers, they have six cooking pots and each pot cook for one order. It took two round for our order to be cooked. This is why it takes time to prepare, cooking and serve foods. The quality of the foods are decent but I don't think it's worth to wait for that long. It's unique to try for once but I would go for other options if you have in mind. Waitresses are very friendly. Prices are fair. I would recommend people to try for their first time.",

    "text": "Be warned, the wait is real. Hidden deep inside the Palace Station, The Oyster Bar is only able to sit around 16 patrons at a time. You're looking at around an hour of meal time when you factor in ordering, apps, food prep, and eating itself. This can create an outrageous wait time, especially during peak hours. For reference, we waited 1.5 hours when there was a big party in front of us. It didn't help that the host, annoyingly, let this certain party add around 6 more of their late friends to the group. AND if you decide to go as a group, note that you most likely won't be seated together.   We ordered a dozen oysters along with our Pan Roast with white rice to share between two. At $20, the oysters were a great way to start off the meal. Fresh and thankfully missing any pungent seafood smell, this held us over as we gazed upon the chef working his magic. Though we shared the Pan Roast, our server offered us an additional side of rice at no charge. Much to our surprise, the portion size for our Pan Roast was more than enough for two. The smooth tomato stew littered with a melody of seafood staples, shrimp, crab, and lobster, was a thing of dreams. You instantly get hit with its rich creamy tomato base with fresh aromatic herbs and cajun flavors. The seafood is also discernible unlike most other kettle bars we've been too. It had me wanting to scrooge mcduck dive into the bowl. No joke.  They stay True to their spice levels as a 7 out of 10 was enough to get me the sniffles.  For a small establishment, they only have 3 workers tending to the restaurants needed. One cook, one kettle chef, and one server/host. Turnover is a bit slow due to the nature of the meal but they're quite quick to bus the station for the next station. Overall, Oyster Bar is by far the best Kettle Bar around. It's a shame we don't anything this great back in Cali. And did I mention its open 24/7...that's simply amazing!",

The reviews are not lying, yes it is that good, yes the lines are long, and yes people will wait for it! I have waited for a spot at that bar top always more than an hour but never over three. So plan accordingly. Bring a friend and rotate line holders, they DO NOT seat if your party is incomplete. And you guessed it, if you order to go you still gotta wait and to be seated for that order!  If you make your way down here try the pan roasts, don't opt in from a clam chowder, or gumbo, you're here for the real deal. PS add in the sausage! Be careful with the spice level, I am a weenie, and a three is great for me, my man chooses a 5 and that is plenty for him! Oysters are a must, and just sit back and watch the chef make your meal in front of you! (One of the best parts in my opinion.) I have been to the other oyster bars, (south point & sunset ) they say its the same...but its nothing like the original, we recently came here last week and its always good, the servers are quick, and the chef who is always working after midnight is a stud! He always makes people laugh, even when he is swamped, you couldn't even tell if he was busy!",

I still waited in line for about 15 minutes, but I noticed around 4am there were a few empty seats at the bar and no line.  Apps: Steamed Little Neck Clams - they were served in a garlic butter sauce and they were delicious.  Steamed New Zealand Mussels - mussels were fresh tasting and very plump. Great garlic sauce. Excellent dish!!!!  Dozen Raw Oysters - very fresh and huge. Excellent oysters!!!  Bouillabaisse - I ordered it spicy (5). It was amazing. The broth was so good and the seafood was very fresh tasting. They gave me a side of jasmine rice to mix with it. I will definitely be ordering this again.  Combo Pan Roast - this was also excellent, but I personally don't care for the creamy tomato sauce. If you like this type of sauce though, I am sure you will love it.  I understand why everyone says to come here now. This place is amazing and I absolutely recommend that you try it.  The Shock Top on tap was pretty good too.",

    "text": "Located inside Palace Station Hotel & Casino, Oyster Bar is a great place to get a bite to eat especially after a long night of clubbing, drinking, or gambling. If I didn't need to wait in line for  an hour and half each time I went, I would love this place even more.   There are no reservations and the lines can get long after midnight, but if you are willing to wait your patience will be rewards. And if you are there from 1 am-9 am their happy hour special is half a dozen oysters for $10. These oysters are not tiny ones that I typically get from shops in San Francisco; these are meaty, delicious and have no sand.   But if you are not a raw oyster person, you cannot go wrong ordering the very popular Combo Pan Roast. It is cooked right in front of you and arrives pipping hot and creamy. The portion size is really enough for two people when you include the rice and bread or just one very hungry person.  Other delicious dishes are the Alaskan Chowder, New England style, Etouffee, and Seafood Jambalaya. But if it's your first time, order the oysters and Pan Roast and come back the next night, like I did to try everything else.  What I recommend:  -- Combo Pan Roast -- New England Alaskan Chowder",

(We waited until we could all sit together)   I've heard that the line can get long and the wait can be over an hour.    Food:  Palace Pan Roast: Shrimp, Crab, Chicken and Andouille Sausage Etouffee: Traditional Cajun Stew prepared with Shrimp, Crab and Lobster  Both dishes were delicious and made before your eyes.    Service:  Although they were accommodating, the cook/chef was a tad bit obnoxious or to me rude.  I know he was joking around with the staff and other patrons but I personally did not like his responses and attitude.  Lastly, I noticed that he only changed his gloves once while we sat there.  He cut vegetables, opened oysters, washed the pots turning on the water etc. and bussing.  Kind of gross but hey I guess it added flavor while he sprinkled garnishes on my Pan Roast.    Overall, I will still return to this establishment because the food is good.",

Palace Station only has 18 eats so the wait is a bit longer (but is the only Oyster Bar of the group that is 24/7). For me, it is worth the 10 minute drive to go to Texas or Santa Fe Stations for no wait.  The food, the Pan Roasts are off the charts amazing! If you have not tried you are missing a great meal. Fresh Seafood sauteed with Brandy, Cream and Tomato. Served with Steamed Rice.   Delicious!",

    "text": "The hype is real. Oyster Bar is undoubtedly the best pan roast this side of the US. There are a number of reasons why you wouldn't want to eat at Oyster Bar.  1.  There are only a handful of seats. You know what that means. Expect to wait. Which brings me to #2. 2.  The wait is on average 1.5 hours. I considered myself lucky with only having to wait 1 hour to be seated. However, it may take as long as a half hour to actually get your food. 3.  The line pours into the casino. No, you cannot leave and expect to get your original spot in line. Don't be surprised if your back door is facing someone sitting at a slot machine, with cigarette smoke fanning towards your face.  Knowing all of this, people are still willing to wait and I now understand why.  Combo Pan Roast -- I watched Bob prepare my pan roast with so much ease it was like 2nd nature to him. He threw in generous scoops of shrimp, crab and lobster. Just that alone impressed the heck out of me. The local spots in my area are pretty chintzy with the seafood portions, and those spots are priced higher than Oyster Bar! The bisque alone had so much depth to the flavor and it had the perfect, creamy consistency. I ordered a level 7 spicy which was probably too daring of me because it was pretty darn spicy. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed my meal.   Not only do you need to go to Oyster Bar but you will want to hope to God Bob is the chef on duty because he is honestly the better chef compared to the other chef I saw.",

    "text": "A line of 15 people does not look like it would take 2 hours to get through BUT it really does. The biggest gamble I took on this trip was coming here at 8 PM on my Saturday night.  Waiting Tips:  1. There is a bar in the casino with very reasonable prices, pour it up. 2. Gamble  Location  The Palace Station is an old casino hotel that is off strip, decently maintained but a bit clustered. The Oyster Bar is in the middle of all that but when you're seated and eating you become oblivious to it.   Service  The service was okay. The servers are not the best at making recommendations, it's like they expect you to know the menu. But the cooks had the right attitude, Professional and hilarious.  Food  Cold Seafood Combination: Fresh. If you know my reviews you know I'm a talker but fresh is all I have to say here. (Be careful with their dipping sauce, tangy and very spicy) 4.5/5  Shrimp Scampi (white sauce): It's a linguini stew with shrimp. The linguini was softer than average but still within a standard deviation of average. The shrimp was as fresh as it was in the combination platter minus the \"cold.\" The sauce was basic but added a gentle soft buttery taste to the linguini. 3.75/5  Shrimp and Lobster Fra Diablo: Sauteed shrimp and lobster..TASTY sauteed shrimp and lobster. The spiciness in the sauce added major flavor to this and made it better than the shrimp scampi. 4.25/5  BEWARE  Eating raw foods can be harsh on the stomach, so be wise about eating here, it wouldn't be fun to let one little oyster ruin your chances at getting \"lucky.\"  Worth the Wait?  It is but not late night, you'll end up spending half your night here. A 430/530 arrival time would be ideal. The food is fresh and one of the best seafood offerings that you'll find in the 702.",

There are chunks of crab, shrimp, lobster, clams, and mussels in a milky tomato stew. So good.  The worst part about The Oyster Bar is easily the wait. The bar only seats approximately sixteen people and diners seem to take FOREVER to finish their food. Be prepared to stand anywhere between one to three hours in line, depending on the time of day. I'd recommend coming early or not at all.",

The line is extraordinarily long, due to it not being an actual restaurant, but a counter with about 16-18 seats, that's all. They seat in order, strictly, so we waited for a long time, and in front of us was a group of 7 and another of 4. When the group of 7 was finally seated, they allowed them to sneak in 2 more people, effectively giving away my 2 seats. When we ordered, they gave our order to another couple who arrived and were seated after us, claiming it was identical order. The 2 couples in line behind us were served and paid their check before we even finished. They gave us a 20% discount, but too much damage had been done. Would never return - this is no 2 hour wait sort of place.",

I am taking one star off for the wait... 2 hours in line and about an hour for food, but I think it was longer because there was a larger take out order of 8 items and a party of 6 as well.   Chris the server was great! Quick with cleaning the areas up and getting our orders taken care of. He was very encouraging with Roberto the Chef. Roberto was fabulous juggling all those orders! Especially with a huge take out order + all the people sitting and waiting for their food. It's crazy to watch one man cook for that long and for that many people. Talk about fast pace work environment.  I was with my Maid of Honor! ;) Good thing it was just the two of us. - Dozen Oysters - huge oysters, server can schuck them too, so they may get served a little earlier - Combo Pan Roast - MUST GET THIS. I WILL COME BACK FOR THIS. Delicious and flavorful - House Gumbo - I will pass on this because everything else was much yummier ;) - Shrimp and Lobster Fra Diablo - DELICIOUS will probably get this one too!  Just have to find a quiet time where there isn't a crazy line.   NOTE:  - No one under 21 allowed at the Bar  - To order take-out you need to stand in that same line - Ordering take-out you are only allowed two items per person",

It's first come first serve so the group of 6 will be sat before a group of 3 even though there are 3 seats open at that time. From 1am-9am 1/2 dozen oysters are $10 but $19.99 for a dozen regular priced. They definitely do not skimp on the size. The oysters were shucked at the bar and come out fresh and plump. Don't eat too much bread and save your stomach for the pan roast since it's a huge portion. It comes out piping hot and is seriously delicious but not sure I could wait two hours for it again. The staff said they're the slowest around 7am so swing by early morning instead of late night.",

With that said, the food was worth the wait. While standing in line the guy in front of us, who is a regular recommend the Pan Roast combo. After looking at the menu, I decided to go with his recommendation. I'm glad I did, as it was a winner.  After seeing how it is made right in front of us I understand why it had so much flavor. So many ingredients went into making this super tasty dish.  Would I stand in that line again? For me personally, probably not multiple times on one trip to Vegas, but I definitely would stand in the line again, maybe once a trip to Vegas. It was totally worth it.",

FYI: The wait can take up to 2-3 hours. (Minus one star for the wait) But seriously, if people are going to complain about the wait, then don't eat here. You already know that you're gonna be waiting 1-2 hours + soooo don't complain. IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT.  My friend and I ordered a dozen oysters and the pan roast. The oysters are freshly chucked right in front of you. Seriously my favorite place to get oysters. Can't get any better than here. And the pan roast, LET ME TELL YOU. Its soooo rich and thick, but SOOO delicious and filling. You have the option of either having rice on the side or pasta. I usually get rice on the side, but the most recent time I went, I got pasta and wow!! What a game changer. I love pasta with the pan roast!!  I've had pan roast else where.. But it doesn't compare to here. Seriously, no comparison. (boosted up the stars again because it's just too good!!)",

Hope the food is better than the pre-meal experience.  :-(   Later that evening....  Food was great...but took about 20-25 minutes to come. Every seat was full (15) the entire time I was there. Chef was great too...working and networking. Had Oysters on the half shell and the house Gumbo. Both really good but the entree portions are big, you could share one.",

We ordered a dozen oysters, the combo pan roast, Alaskan chowder, and Cioppino. Everything was incredibly good, but the pan roast was my favorite. The chef cooks everything in front of you, which is nice because we can see how fresh the ingredients are. Will absolutely come back again and recommend it.",

I have wanted to come here for years, finally did by booking a weekend at Palace Station with my mom (boy does the casino blow, but that's another review).  We didn't have to wait at all on a Friday, got there around 6pm.   Got a half a dozen raw oysters and clams each, sweet waitress gave it to us for the price of a dozen oysters to save money.  Bottle of white wine was under $30.  I got the gumbo, mom got the crab pan roast. I had serious food envy...we both got it at a 5/10. Sat next to a kid and his mom that lived in town and he got a 10! Boy was it fun to watch him eat that slowly.   Total meal...less than $100, in Vegas that's a steal.  We went back the next day to split a house pan roast, got a 6/10...depending on who cooks it for you the heat level can vary with the numbers. If you are unsure just get a lower number, you can always spice it up. We also got a crab cake...there are happy hour prices, it was yum.  I might be back for lunch next month when I am in Vegas again...yeah it's that good.",

Well, been here many times and never reviewed because I really want this place to be a secret lol  yeah right.....so popular.   Anyway, I wanted to Thank Christina and Nora for their wonderful service.  They work so hard and always have a smile.  And for those who give them a hard time....im sure its because you're tired of waiting and it might be your first time.  Please be patient...this place can be off the hook...they have a good system.    Christina and Nora have developed a way to get everyone taken care of in the most efficient manner. Sooooo you may see several chairs empty and you wonder why .....just trust them....they will seat you when its most effective.  They run a rotation and it may seem like you are not be attended to but its not...just wait and enjoy.   So, when you see that Christina or Nora working....have faith....they are great and amazing.   The cooks....i met a few ...never got names but....Thank you for the hard work and prep'in the food to perfection each time.  You are great at your craft.   Thanks again girls for taking care of us.   -  Bangkok Couple",

My mouth is watering just thinking about it. If you're not familiar with a pan roast, its kind of like a seafood stew in a buttery tomato sauce. I had never heard of a pan roast until I tried it here, and let me just say I was hooked from the first bite!  The only downfall is that this place is tiny, the bar seats 18 only, and that means there are super long waits! On my last visit, we waited about 45 minutes for a party of 2 which isn't so bad, but sucks if you're hungry ;)   Let me just say that the wait is worth it. I would wait hours just to eat here, it is that good. Do yourself a favor and try this place! 5 stars for sure!",

    "text": "We were here for our annual golf week with the guys and we went here right after golf the first and second day.  For some of us, this is a new experience, others we know Bob and Maggie pretty well.  We are there Wed/Thurs/Fri at around 3 pm.   Usually, there is a wait to get one of the twenty seats on this Oyster bar.  The wait can get up to an hour or more.  Most of the time we get seats next to each other.  Sometimes not.   But it doesn't matter since it is a small bar where you can hear everyone's conversation.  And that's the fun of this place.  Everyone gets to talk to each other on where you are from to our poor golf game.    Maggie will take your order and Bob will cook it.  Be nice or they will ignore you, or give you crap.  Either way be nice.  The cooking station is right in front of you.  The gumbo and pan roast are the staples of this bar.  First timers should go for the pan roast with a high of 5 on the heat scale.  They will ask what heat you want mild ( 1 ) to hot ( 10 ).  Don't be a fool and go for 10.  It will be more than you want.  8 is as high as real people go.  Lower than 5, Bob will give you the \"wimp\" look.  The station can cook up to six at a time, so do the math.  Twenty seats, six at a time.  This is why you order oysters on the half or other fillers.  Oysters on the half are shucked right there.  Be nice again.  Bob does the shucking.  They also have clam steamers, mussels, and shrimp.  There' s wine and beer on tap.   The grand total will be less than you think.  A dozen oysters at $19, Pan roast at $20, drinks at $3.50.  It will be one of the best and one of the cheapest meal you had in Vegas.  Specials from 1am to 9am, oysters are $8.99 a dozen and 16oz Buds are $2  They are open 24 hours.  So get there",

There are only 18 seats and depending on the time of the day, you can be waiting for few minutes or all the way up to hours. On our first day (Friday), we came here around 5pm and waited less than 30 minutes. Not bad. There were four of us and we ordered two dozen oysters, two combo pan roast, and two shrimp scampi. The shrimp scampi was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Oysters were fresh and delicious but I have eaten better oysters in the past. But what we all raved about was the PAN ROAST. Boy was it yummy! I got spicy level 2 and my friend got spicy level 4.   In the end, both were spicy and we actually couldn't tell if 2 was as hot as 4 or not. Anyway NO big deal. We love spicy, just as long as it isn't taking over the entire mouth.   On Sunday morning, we still couldn't get over the delicious Pan Roast and decided to go again. Of course, sin city has no church goers, it was packed with a line. We waited 2 hours from 11-1pm and finally got seated. It was worth it. But not sure if it was the line or if we were hungrier on a Friday afternoon but Friday's Pan Roast tasted a bit better.  PS the staff there are super chill and cool. They are nice if you are nice to them. But they will be rude to the ones that are snobby, douchey, and rude. So don't matter if you are rich or poor. Be nice to the servers and the cooks and they will be nice to you as well.",

There is literally 15 seats, one chef and one server/bus boy/host. If they had more staff, this wouldn't been an issue but local guests told us that Oyster Bar has been doing this since they've open. As far as the food, it's good. We ordered the oysters, crab & shrimp roast, and clam chowder. Everything was fresh and the portions was big. As far as the service, there was none. The waiter has no time to check up on the bar because he's too busy taking orders and prepping the clean dishes and such. Overall would I come back if I was in Vegas ? No. The wait wasn't worth it, Orange  County's Kettle Bar in Anaheim will always be my favorite.",

I asked for a few oysters to make up the diff, and not a second of hesitation before \"sure!\"    It seemed expensive for a Pan Roast or Gumbo, but one order is easily enough for two people, if you get a salad and some oysters or clams.

Clam chowder delicious. Little neck clams were good. Kind of on the salty side though. Ordered pan roast with spicy rating 7. Enough spice to give it a kick. Overall a good meal. Will return to try the moonlight special next time.",

I have pretty much had all their dishes, started with the GUMBO but now I only order Combo Pan Roast.  Doesn't matter what your into..... oysters on the half shell steam clams steam mussels  Don't be afraid to ask for substitutions or additions to your dish they will treat you like a king, you queen what ever you prefer. Just to make things right!  WOW, you just cant beat this place, nothing comes close. I have been to Reno \"Nugget\" claims to be the best........ NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Been to NY sorry not the best either. Does not even come close... Been to the Atlantis in Reno they need help!  Funny the chef came up to me and ask me how was my dinner... sorry but i had to brag about the pan roast at the Palace.... told him it still need help in order to compete.  anyways moving on here. I tell and bring as many people as I can, over a time period of 8 years I still enjoy this place, I just home they dint tear it down and put a big fancy bar and loose the fine people that work there.  FYI.... don't bother asking for the recipe I have been there when people ask and have even offered $10k for it. it is not for sale, keep coming back folks.  yes the lines are long and i have been waiting in them as long as 1.5 hours but it is all worth the wait.  their are only about 12 seats but it is a privilege to eat there every time.  enjoy to the fullest.",

(bummer that they started the $5 split fee) but still worth it! Order the crab cakes ( not on the menu) they are spectacular, all crab meat light breading with lemon butter sauce and capers topped with fried potato strings. I have eaten at this bar at least 25 times and always get the pan roast but finally decided to try the shrimp scampi because it always smelled so delicious however, I wasn't too impressed with the flavor. I'll def stick to the pan roast. I have been to sunset oyster bar, south point, and green valley ranch, none even compare to palace station. It's worth the wait and drive!",

A spice level of 5 had a kick and was good with the rice.  It was still tolerable for me and I can only take a little spice.  The flavor was amazing!  I don't like tomato soup or cheesy soups and was afraid I wouldn't like it, but it was just creamy enough to not be overwhelming and it wasn't overly tomato-ish.  The lobster meat was very tender and usually lobster is too tough for me.  The shrimp was ok.  The crab meat was good.  One bowl is definitely good to share for two and you will both be licking the bowl clean!  The jambalaya looked good too!  I would love to try that next time.  The only downfall, besides the wait, is the oysters.  For a place called the oyster bar, the oyster was just ok.  Their large oysters from Louisiana.  It was slightly salty for me and wasn't anything special.  Service was great too!  The waiter was really friendly and helped us decide what to get and I was glad to have listened to his recommendation.  I would love to come back if I ever get a chance to have a car again while in Vegas.",

    "text": "As hole in the walls goes...this ain't no surprise to locals and many out-of-towners. The key buy here is to sit outside in the relatively smokey casino portion (under the hoods and next to the member rewards card center) and NOT (I repeat NOT) to sit inside the Broiler restaurant.   Why not you ask?  2 words: STEAM POTS  Add to that the guys who cook up their crazy concoctions - JJ and Greg - as well as the cool under pressure server Dolores (aka Dolly) and you won't be disappointed. It's like having your favorite sports' dream team serving you up some serious good eats. And...unlike many LV shows, you won't have to pay a pretty penny for these guys to entertain you. And that's kind of what this is....steam pot seafood dishes (pan roast, bouillabaisse, cioppino, gumbo, etc) made fresh to order EVERY order with a show to boot. Think of this as Benihana with steam pots. And just like when you were a kid and the tepanyakia chefs would entertain with their knives and histrionics....well, you get that here with ribs and jabs to customers sitting at the \"bar\".  Just a quick note: do not confuse this place with the other Station casino copies - e.g., Tidelands Oyster bar elsewhere. This place is all about the chefs (JJ and Greg)...those other places make the same dishes...but the skill and adaptability to changing orders on the fly is not there. Plus some of these places don't use steam pots. They cook it on a stove top. Boo!   What's so awesome about the steam pots then?  For starters, the steam pots NEVER overcook your precious cargo load of seafood these guys put into your dish. Seriously, everytime I've ordered something here, I've been amazed at 1) the quality of seafood, 2) the portions of seafood and 3) how perfectly tender and succulent the seafood is cooked each time. The other thing is just watching these guys cook up their creations using the pots....it's SO cool!   We usually order the combo pan roast which runs you a hefty $20....but if you consider the fact that you get huge portions of shrimp, lobster and big pieces of lump crab...PLUS you could easily feed 3 people with the servings you get. Well, it's not a bad deal right? What's also best is just being able to specify your specific heat level in ANY dish. They will accommodate you. I've requested 4 fresh habaneros in my pan roast before...but the usual scale of 1 - 10 applies for those not accustomed to the H-bomb, as I refer to it.  If a tomato cream-based pan roast doesn't suit you, they have several other dishes that are made exclusively in their steam pots like seafood bouillabaisse (w/ crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp), gumbo (e.g., crab only, shrimp only, combo), pasta dishes (vongole, shrimp, etc.), as well as an Alaskan chowder, jambalaya and red beans and rice. I've never tried there namesake (oysters) here, but I've heard good things...I'm just a bit of an oyster snob so if I don't know the source of them (Kumomotos, Blue Points, etc), I usually shy away from eating them. But then again, why bother? B/c all you need to know is that they have STEAM POTS FTMFW!!!!  One final word of advice, it packs up in a line here around dinner time (waits can be as long as an hour or more depending on party size - only ~18  seats at the bar). Since everything is first come first serve, don't expect any favoritism or joking around with skipping the line. Dolly, JJ and Greg are serious when it comes to that line. Think \"soup nazi\". If you're short on time, go between the lunch hour and dinner time (1 - 5pm) for almost immediate service. Also, if you're a frequent gambler or you get mailings from the Station casino rewards programs...you can score some free eats (e.g., $45 coupons). If not, go sign up at the booth next door and you'll see what I mean (hopefully you can use it on your next visit). Also, if you're shy about eating a whole $20 bowl of food...just say you're sharing one of their creations. They're totally okay with that. And yes, beer and wine can be ordered here. Last visit, they got rid of Gordon Biersch in favor of Kona Longboard - awesome. Finally, can't find the place? Look for the line of Asians here. Seriously...we know good seafood. 'nuff said.  Despite the OJ debacle of Palace Station, Oyster Bar should not be overlooked on your next off-strip visit to LV. Makes me wonder...\"what if OJ ate here?\" Ask Dolly...she'll know.",

I thought I was going to a restaurant and was a little dissapointed because I wanted to be alone and not bugged because of my hangover.  It actually was a bar as if you were going to grab a drink.  Anyways, arrived there and got seated right away, fortunately. This place is amazing..that's all I have to say.  I'm on a venture right now to find this somewhere in the Los Angeles/Orange County area.  I recommend going there early because by the time I was done with my meal, there was a long long line with people looking very miserable.  Anyways, go early and you have to order the Pacific Pan Roast, the one that is at the top of the pan roast menu.  This is right up there with my cravings for either Boiling Crab (crawfish) or Indian Food (chicken tika masala).  So much flavor.  I most definitely will go back here, every time I'm in Vegas.  Now where can I go to find this in Los Angeles? hmm... :/  I am at work now..yelping while i should actually be working on this very gloomy Monday back from Vegas. sigh..",

It's worth it because it's Vegas and it's literally almost the same price as all the other places, except they give you wayyyy more seafood!!! I think back home all the places were like 22$, Oyster Bar was like 25$ except it's a way bigger portion, they give you a variety of sauces, and SOURDOUGH bread!!!! It's so good lol. It's creamier than the other places I've tried so I'm guessing it's more fattening too ):  I also probably liked it more than other people since I came like at 1AM and only had to wait like 10 minutes..it says it's only for people 21+, but I'm not sure if they actually care?

    "text": "This is one of my FAVORITE favorite places in Vegas. FAVORITE. You won't be sorry for coming here. It's worth the cab ride from the Strip and the long line 24/7 should tell you something.   The line can be at least an hour, so make sure you account for that. It's best to come here with a group. Some group members can gamble or go to the casino bar for rounds of drinks while the others hold down your spot, then switch. That's kind of lonely to do with just a couple. What's cool about this place is that when you're next in line, they'll keep the order of the line and not pull smaller parties from behind you because there are less seats available. They'll ask people to move down the bar so that your party can fit.   Good beer selection (Shock Top and Widmer included) and also a full bar offered.   Service is phenomenal.  What to order here are the pan roasts. The Palace Pan Roast has crab, shrimp and sausage, and the Combo Pan Roast has crab, shrimp, and lobster. It's a delicious, creamy, tomato-y, spicy, rich stew with VERY generous seafood and rice on the side. Choose your own level of spice from 1-10. When my leftovers came out of the microwave today, I almost had to change my pants. A friend ordered the Alaskan Chowder, which had fresh clams in the shell on top and generous seafood. One of the best clam chowders I've ever had.   Oyster shooters (tequila or vodka) are 3 for $10, and between 4 and 10 is happy hour, with discounted bacon-wrapped shrimp in an incredible sauce (and the shrimp are HUGE), crab cakes, fried calamari, oysters rockefeller, and a few more items. We ordered most of the menu since.... why not?   I can't wait to come here any try other items... if I can bring myself to stray from the pan roast. I love this place so much.",

    "text": "Awhile some of my friends kept talking about how good Oyster Bar was, so I decided to go to Harrah's to check it out. I was confused by their recommendations because the menu there was mediocre. At least the oysters were delicious. It turns out I was going to the WRONG one! My girlfriend and I were so excited to check this place out that we decided to leave the club early to eat here.  This place is called Oyster Bar for a reason. It's only a bar consisting of 14-18 chairs, so you can imagine that standing in line can take a long time. It took about 1 hour for us to get seated when there were only about 4 groups ahead of us.  Food: 1) Oysters of the day is a great appetizer. They were very fresh and large. I've actually haven't seen oysters this big.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=FDG_fUoUjs-KavTq8D0Hng#JkeczflLv7omKCAepuho0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/oyst...</a> 2) Pan Roast Level 8 Spicy had a decent kick, but not enough to satisfy my spicy Asian taste buds. I think I'll go for level 10 next time. The tomato cream sauce was so creamy and savory that I couldn't put my spoon down. The portions here were so large that I had to take it to go despite my large appetite. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=FDG_fUoUjs-KavTq8D0Hng#SdiA6-GgqYBGLTXtsph7pQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/oyst...</a> 3) Gumbo - out of the few times I've tried gumbo, the gumbo here would have to be the best out of those experiences. The red brick roux was by far the best.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=FDG_fUoUjs-KavTq8D0Hng#Mdd4OMnfoQf_Z8YFx5krig\">yelp.com/biz_photos/oyst...</a>",

We had a dozen oysters, bouillabaisse, spice level 3 gumbo and mild pan roast. All had different soup and they were all so good. It is too bad this place is so far from us ( we live in LA), but we always look forward to coming here when we are in Vegas. We've been coming here almost 10 years, and only locals knew about this place back them. Now, we have to wait in the long line, but it definitely worth it. Try to be here before 10am on weekdays to avoid the long wait!",

No rest for the wicked open 24/7...It's well worth the wait once your butt is resting.  I got the combo pan lobster shrimp crab roast with a side of pasta OML where has this place been all of my life?  The lobster is cooked to perfection super tender and delicate big pieces make sure you order an extra lobster tail.  The shrimp is delicious too you can't go wrong.  The portions are huge so split with at least 1 buddie and they charge $5 for a split but it's a lot of yummy food.  Unless you're a big big eater it's wise to split or take it home and don't share :P have round 2 bwahaha.  I had half a dozen oysters and they shuck oysters in front of you soooo good.   It's extremely busy and they always have so many take out orders.   There is free complimentary bread comes warm but nothing to boast about.  Nonetheless, the pan roast the pan roast the pan roast :) foodgasm foodporn nom nom!  Why are you still reading this post ... Go ;)",

The waitress that helped us that day was so nice and funny!   **another thing, you have to be over 21 to even eat here (so incase you have kids or under 21).  We both got the pan roast with lobster, crab, and shrimp.   I got my heat 5 and my boyfriend got his heat 2. They were both so delicious! I really wish I could have finished the whole thing but it really fills you up! They offer a take out container also.   This is my new go to spot in Vegas. I don't care how long the wait is!

    "text": "The next time you find yourself in Vegas, be sure to stop by the Oyster Bar at Palace Station Casino. It is home to one of the most amazing seafood dishes I've ever had!  The Oyster Bar is literally a bar inside the casino, which means there is very limited seating (I think another reviewer said there are 18 seats). I arrived with a party of four people at 11:00 AM, and it took around an hour and fifteen minutes for us to be seated. The smell of the cooking pan roast wafted over to the line while we were waiting, it was tantalizing and almost cruel. By the time my party was seated we were ready to eat!  We started off the meal with a dozen raw oysters and raw clams. If I were to eat here again,  I would skip these next time. The oysters and clams were nothing special. As an avid fan of raw mollusks, I prefer a smaller oyster and clam because they have a sweeter and more seafood-y taste. The ones served here were fairly large, didn't have much flavor, and were not that memorable. PASS on the oyster and clams.   The True star of this place is the PAN ROAST. It is as amazing as everyone on here say it is. I am salivating just thinking about it as I type out this review right now. In summary, the pan roast is very generous portion of seafood heaven. It's creamy, savory, and chock full of seafood. You can choose how spicy you want it on a scale of 0-10. I was tempted to order a 8 or 9 (I love spicy food), but the chef warned me they really crank up the heat here. He was right - I opted for a 7, and there was actually a good amount of spice in there. I don't think I could have tasted my food if I ordered an 8. This  dish is also very big, and can be split among two people  We also ordered the deablo, which was very delicious. I would recommend getting this if you're looking to order something else besides the pan roast. It is a pasta dish that resembles cioppino, and is served with heaping portions of shrimp and lobster. You can also choose how spicy you want it on a scale of 0-10.  The entrees here start at around $20, which is fairly pricey - but hey, it's good seafood. It's definitely worth the trip off strip, the 1+ hour wait, and the money.  I would highly recommend this place to my fellow Yelpers!",

Although the ambiance is meh (in the middle of the casino floor of a meh casino), the food and personalities of the cook and server totally make up for it.  We've been here multiple times, I think we've had all the cooks and servers who work here and there isn't a bad one.  The best thing on the menu is hands down the combo pan roast.  The combination of ingredients give the base so much depth.  I'm addicted to all things spicy and a spice level of 6 is good enough for me (but maybe it seems more spicy because the pan roast comes to me piping hot and I just want to scarf it down!)  We also get the oysters from time to time.  I've def had better, but these are not bad for the price and they are giganormous!   We always try to come at really random times to avoid lines (10:00 Sunday mornings is our secret).  If not, get ready to stand in line.",

I had the shrimp gumbo, and other people in my party ordered the seafood gumbo and the pan roast. Absolutely amazing!  First, the bowl of gumbo was about $17, but the bowl was HUGE! I could barely eat half of it, but felt guilty leaving any behind! They ask you how spicy you want it (1-10). I ordered a 7 and it was hot enough to give a kick, but not burn my tongue. The shrimp was fresh, large and the food was cooked right in front of us which was fun! My boyfriend usually HATES seafood and he could not stop eating his mixed seafood gumbo.   Although this place is off the strip  a bit at the Palace Station, it's worth the ride over. The atmosphere was incredible. Service is at a bar with about 20 seats and the cooks and owner are there chatting with you and are super friendly. It's a great place to meet the people sitting next to you and have some AWESOME food. Portions are ginormous so I easily could have split my bowl of gumbo. For the next 5 days of my vacation, I kept on craving this place! Can't wait to go back! Delicious!",

    "text": "So disappointed!!! I came here in 2006 and had arguably one of the best seafood meals in my life. Everything was so good! Sad to say, I went back in 2012 and had the worst meal I've ever had in Vegas, and that's saying a lot because I've eaten in a lot of shady places. Worst martini ever! Seriously it tasted like the pool. My beer was equally disgusting. Someone needs to tell the waitress the cleanser they use on the glasses is way too strong. Got roasted corn clam chowder and would have guessed it was canned corn if it weren't for the boatloads of silk in it! Not to mention it was probably made the week previous. Oysters were small and chewy, To top it all off, the signature grill dish came with the spicy tomato diablo sauce instead of the brandy cream sauce. Don't get me wrong, I like spicy food but if I order something I expect to get what I paid for. It's probably better that i didn't eat it because the cook behind the line was unsanitary as hell. DUDE, WASH YOUR F'ing HANDS WHEN YOU TOUCH YOUR FACE!! HAVE YOU HEARD THE TERM \"DOUBLE DIPPING\"? When I told the waitress of the mistake she first tried to convince me that I was wrong, I was not, then took  the sanitizing liquid tasting anchor steam beer off the check. Like that makes it better. Luckily, at least the $100+ we spent didn't get us sick. I will never stay at the Sun Coast inn because this food was so bad. FOR SHAME!!!!!!!",

I will definitely come back in the future when I get a chance.",

The casino has an outdated ventilation system, so if you can't take the smoke, you will not be able to come here.  Also: there are only 17 seats (at a counter) and no reservations are taken.  This means that you will wait unless you are very lucky.  Do not come with a big party -- not feasible.  The food is pretty great: we had oysters and a Pan Roast (all sorts of seafood prepared in a delicious, creamy tomoato sauce).  It's fun to watch the chef prepare the meals right in front of you.  The only other employee is the waitress and these two work their tails off when there's a line.  Although the food was pretty great, I don't know that I'd return because I don't like to wait in line and the smoke was pretty awful.  My clothes smelled afterward.",

We waited 2.5 hours to sit down. I considered breaking up the friendship at that moment, because I was starving, but there was nothing else around. I threw some money into some slots and we waited out turn while making some friends in line. We were probably #10 ten in line when we arrived... yeah. Some people just hang out regardless of the drooling masses eyeing their bar stools.   The food... so it's soup. And it is very good. And the chef is very friendly. The rest of the staff was a little absent in their service, which in part explains the huge delays. I was hangry and order a dozen oysters to start. Let me preface by stating that I love oysters and eat them often. I have never had oysters like these. Imagine a large human tongue... yeah, like that. Not sweet, but if you;re the type who likes to cover your delicious oysters in topping to cover their natural flavor then you might love them. I did not.  If you have a friend like mine who drags you here, order the combo pan roast and enjoy a few beers. You will leave full and moderately happy.",

Our order:  combo pan roast: awesome seafood combo that had an amazing flavor.  dozen oysters: (midnight special is 1/2 dozen for $10 and starts at 1am). Very surprised how large the oysters were. They were very good though. Not fishy at all. No options on the type of oyster.  Etouffee: Cajun stew with shrimp, crab, and lobster. Huge chunks of everything! Excellent.   We ordered both at spicy level 7. We were so hungry that we didn't realize that it wasn't spicy at all until the end of our meal when our neighbors asked us how the level 7 was. We said it wasn't spicy at all and they let us try theirs at level 6. It tasted so much better with the extra kick. We were all full by that time though and it was 4am so didn't fuss. Good regardless. If you can suck up the wait, it's a pretty decent seafood bar.",

They must have the most expert and dilligent seafood buyer with the highest standards of quality and freshness always.  Plus they serve it immediately post cooking...so pan to table time just seconds vs. minutes.

The line is not long but you wait FOREVER. They must be short staffed because the bus boy was also the cook (so of course he took forever to clear plates and set up for new guests). There were plenty of times where 2-4 seats were open but the people in front of us could not sit down yet because the spots needed to be cleared. There were probably 8 people in front of us and we waited for TWO HOURS. Excuse my French but f&%k that!!! Never again!!!!!!!!!!! Once we were seated, it took about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready so by that time, we were desperately drinking our water and ate our oysters way too fast.  Food: 2.5/5 The oysters were very good. Even though they looked like they had been given steroids to grow as big as they were, they were delicious. The gumbo, on the other hand, was awful. I barely finished mine. I wish the oysters could make up for the gumbo but both dishes were sooooo expensive. So nope, they did not make up for the gumbo being gross.  Overall experience: 1.5 (giving them two because I feel bad kind of....) I will never go to this place again. I live near San Francisco so I will never take my SF oysters for granted again. LOL.",

My longest wait was 2 hours starting at 3AM Saturday night (everyone is out from clubbing). My shortest was no wait at 9:15AM on Sunday.  As for the food, everything is really good, but I'd skip some of the pan roasts as a bit too creamy. Do not skip out on the the Gold Band raw oysters they are the most meaty, and cleanest raw oysters I have ever eaten. Happen hour for those ends at 9AM.

    "text": "The pan roast and clam chowder were delicious, but not so amazing that I would wait in their line again. It's worth trying once if you're a seafood/chowder lover. We came on a Monday afternoon around 11:30am, and it was already a 45 minute wait with about 10 people in front of us. Oyster Bar is located in the Palace Station Casino off the strip, so you'll have to taxi or Uber to get here. I would recommend trying to come super early or super late at night (they're open 24/7) to avoid the line. They only have about 15-20 seats in a counter style set up. We ended up trying:  -Combo Pan Roast (Creamy Tomato Stew Finished w/Brandy, Served w/Rice, w/Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, $23.99, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KW421aU4osMxIhwFq_8XvQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): This was my favorite dish out of the ones we tried. I liked the flavor of the stew, but it was definitely tasted very rich. I wish I ordered it spicier (we got a 4 out of 10 and it did nothing for me). Overall, this was a solid dish and great for eating with rice. They don't skimp on the seafood at all- recommended! -House Gumbo (Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, $23.99, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eKWQornep6kekUTddnJR8A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): I am not a gumbo fan so didn't like this version. It was decently flavorful, and they also give you a giant bowl. Worth trying if you're into gumbo. -New England Clam Chowder (Bowl, $8.99, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=J2hM2yJEe37f-Lv6bYkK6w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yum, delicious! The clam chowder was nice and creamy, and full of clams with less potatoes, which is my preference. A must try for any clam chowder lover! -Oysters on the Half Shell ($17.99/Dozen, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Lh4ORXiwOQuK26kDvLgoLA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yikes, these oysters are GIGANTIC! They were very fresh, but don't have much brine/flavor to them, and there is a lot of meat. I like oysters, but I don't think I could eat more than 5 of these. However, after having these once, I wouldn't order them again.  Service was ok, but it's very low maintenance since they take your order from the other side of the bar. The food takes at least 10 minutes to prepare, but you get everything piping hot.",

The wait is still 1-2 hours depending on the time you go. The chef will even tell you that it's usually about a 2 hour wait and if you didn't wait that long, he might make you stand to the side to wait till your 2 hour is up (so don't let him know!--jk!) There's no going wrong with any of the Pan Roasts.   Go there. Eat. Make friends with neighbors. Laugh.   The only thing I feel needs to be highlighted as new news--order pasta to add into your Pan Roast.",

There is something about their oyster that makes it different from the others. It tastes fresh and clean. Keep in mind, I didn't even like oysters when I came here. I came here for the talk about their pan roast. We'll talk about that next. But my boyfriend got the oysters and made me try it again. I fell in love with how chewy and fresh it tasted topped with tabasco, lemon and soy sauce. Lorddddd! I became an oyster fan. Should i say oyster bar fan?! You can order the half dozen oysters for 12.99 i believe? Then pass midnight it drops down to 10! Asides from their oysters, you MUST MUST MUST try their pan roast! I got the Everything Pan Roast and I had to order one to go. It was perfect. The taste, the texture and the amount of meat. It comes with white rice, which is a plus for me! You can order it spicy or not spicy at all.",

I was like, \"wtfreak!!  don't people sleep?!?\"  Then I remembered I was in Vegas.  Sigh.  While standing in line, everyone in front and back of us were complaining about the wait, but kept blabbering about how good the food was.  FINALLY, about an hour and a half later, we were given the thumbs up sign by the staff to seat ourselves at the bar.  Sitting never felt so good!  Engulfed the roll and water they set in front of me and I ordered the Combo Pan Roast while the hubs got the House Gumbo.    I enjoy cooking and watching the chef prepare the food was like a live showing of \"Iron Chef America\" or something.  It was exciting and I loved it!  The chef was really friendly and funny.  He was interactive with the diners and was the star of the show.  Duh.  The hubs was amazed at how he could cook seven dishes at once, knowing exactly when to add in the next meat or spice.    The food!  Combo Pan Roast was so rich and flavorful.  They don't skimp on the meat and seafood!  So much shrimp and sausage.  I couldn't tell the difference between the crab and lobster in the dish though.  The hubs enjoyed the gumbo.  I tried some but prefer the pan roast for sure.    We had a lot of leftovers and kept it cold over ice in the sink at our hotel.  Classy.  The servings are humungo!  Definitely more than enough to share between two people.  $5 to share an entree.  Would I come back and wait again?  If you asked me that night after eating, I probably would have said no. After the loooong drive home, I heated up the leftovers and the pan roast was amazeballs.  Yes, I probably would wait again if I had to.  But I'm willing to come here at 9 AM in hopes of getting a seat right away and stuffing my face for breakfast.",

This place is ALWAYS busy, mostly because there are only about 15 spots to sit at, but just get in line and wait for it. Seriously. It's THAT good. Plus, you can always get cheap drinks at the casino bar while you wait so win-win.   The New England chowder is AMAZING, put some Tabasco in it and soak up your bread in every bite.   For the star of the show, the COMBO PAN ROAST, AKA heaven in a bowl. It is a creamy, tomato-y, crab/shrimp,lobstery bowl of deliciousness. Get it. Trust me, just get it. And split it. It's HUGE.   The cooks are right there making everything in front of you so you can start drooling right away. It's a fun environment and you can always strike up a convo with the cooks or other guests and have a great time! I always tip them well as they are kicking ass and taking names ALLLLL day long!!",

Whenever I visit Vegas, normally 3-4 times a year I always make time to come to the Oyster bar at least once a visit if not more.  Delicious!!!  I always start off with a dozen Oysters on the half shell with plenty of raw horse radish, then go into the main course of Bouillabaisse, in my opinion, the best thing in the menu next to their fresh Oysters.  I have tried many dishes here, all of which have been great, but the Bouillabaisse is now my dish of choice.  They load it up with giant shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels, crab legs and white fish with celery, all in an mouth watering broth, not too thick, just right.  Served with a bowl of rice and unlimited dinner rolls.   Mmmm, thinking about it makes me want to visit again soon.  The Palace Station Casino itself has recently remodeled and everything is new and it is a lot nicer that it was before, it was run down an old before, but they put some of my money back into the joint and it is so much cleaner and nicer.  A big, big plus as well is that it is a lot less smoky in the casino since the remodel, I think they upgraded their venting system as well.  Great job Palace Station.  This would have gotten 5 stars, but the wait can be quite long, which brings it down a notch.l  Enjoy.",

Me and my husband decided to randomly stop by since we were in the area, thankfully we didn't make a night of it like we had intended to or else we would have been even more disappointing. The oysters are extremely low quality and were poorly shucked. I've eaten better oysters at a buffet than what I was served here. Luckily the shrimp cocktail was decent otherwise I would have left at that moment. Besides the food being prepared right in front of you, there is really nothing special about this place other than being conveniently placed at the hotel.",

So I am glad we went a bit earlier, that way we were starving by the time we got seated.   My friend always comes here whenever she comes to Vegas, so I was so glad to finally be able to come and try this place.   I ordered the pan roast level 10 spicy + habaneros, and we also split two dozen oysters.  They also serve a warm sourdough bun with the meal, our food came out in about 15 min which wasn't that long because everything is made fresh.   The oysters here are the big fleshy ones that aren't creamy, I probably wouldn't get them again since my tastes have changed now, I prefer small creamy oysters as opposed to large tasteless ones.   The pan roast here is delicious!! So creamy, tomato-y , fatty, and spicy!! The level 10 spicy with habaneros is very manageable and not that spicy at all, I could still taste all the yummminess in the pan roast!  I would definitely come here again, but I would probably come really late at night instead around 3-5 am.   Prices are a bit high, but they have massive serving sizes.",

This fine place is a bar type restaurant hence the name, oyster bar. I thought it was a restaurant type setting but I was wrong. There isn't a lot of seating so There's always a LONG line for it but believe me. It's worth it!!!   The food:   LOBSTER PAN ROAST 10/10!! - SO amazing I can't even explain it. So creamy, flavorful, explosion. Lobster cooked perfectly. Tender, buttery and plentiful :O NOODLES cooked to perfection!!! O god.. I can taste it now!!   OYSTERS: fresh, succulent. Delicious!   Service: friendly service from the guys behind the bar. Thank you!!!!",

It was 4am on a Tuesday morning when I paid this establishment a visit...and there were still people! Now don't let the talk about the wait deter you, just find the right times to go. With the limited seating offered, you'll be waiting for a while at peak times.   I got the pan roast, which was a hearty and satisfying meal. The pairing with rice and bread made this dish a perfect dish to have late after a night out. Throw in the kind spirited workers there talking and laughing with your group and you have a perfect night. I can't stress how wonderful the workers there are, offering us extra bowls of rice, extra bread, and great recommendations on their dishes.   If I were you, don't pass up the opportunity to give this place a shot. With the different types of food offered, you have plenty of reason to come back :)",

My friend misinformed me and told me there was some other items other than seafood, buuut NOPE. The only other food that wasn't seafood was bread. Luckily, I'm OK with eating some fish, so I got the Parmesan Crusted Halibut, but it honestly wasn't that great to me. I'm sure if I was into oysters, it would've been delicious. My friends raved about the clam chowder from there too.  Speaking for my other friends that love to eat seafood, they loved the oysters. My friend loves this restaurant by the way. The dishes are expensive of course, but what do you expect from Las Vegas. The Calamari was mostly just batter, which was disappointing for my friends. I kind of wanted to try the Lobster Ravioli since it seemed doable for me, but I took a chance with the halibut.  The sauce was called a \"florentine\" sauce or something. Not really my cup of tea, but I didn't have much to choose from.  Don't listen to your friends and believe them when they say there's more than just seafood if you're not that into that.... Just go to the burger place right next door to Oyster Bar.",

We Googled and yelped and quickly arranged a cab to see if it met expectations.   We got there at 4:30 on a Friday.   We waited in line about an hour to be seated.   Perhaps hotel management could make this part a little less miserable?  My back aches when I stand too long and I'm not even that old.   C'est la vie,  we knew we would be waiting,  I just wish the wait was a little easier on the back.   We were seated and the entire staff was friendly and helpful.   A roll appeared and I swear it was the best roll ever.   Or it could have been the wait.   We ordered a dozen oysters,  a few oyster shots and the palace pan roasted.   The oysters and shots came out quickly and we devoured them even quicker.   The selection of hot sauce was excellent and the oysters were fresh and plump.  The shots were Ok,  I've had better but I've also had much worse.   3 for $10 was fair.   We ordered the pan roasted and split it.   They don't charge a split plate fee if you order $15 in appetizers so we were good.   Split plate fees bug me as a rule so that made me happy.   The pan roasted itself was creamy and rich.   It was amazing but there's no way either of us could have finished the bowl by ourself.     Ricardo was funny and fun to watch.   He made it look so easy and he kept us laughing.   I appreciated his multi-tasking skills,  he worked quickly and efficiently.   Keep in mind that there are only 18 seats.   We had a few very nice people sitting there who were kind enough to move stools to allow others to sit,  but that was on their own accord.   It's quite a wait but totally worth it.",

So don't get upset if you say random seats empty... they're clearing it out for the next GROUP or PERSON in line.   At first we were like... WHYYYY are there open seats.. but then we realized.    We told the person that we would take seats of two or three or five-whichever opened up first!    The pan roast is AMAZING.  Level 8... I wish I got level 10 but we were sharing.

Can't wait to come back. This definitely will be a must every time I'm in Vegas from here on out.    Actually, my gfs and I are already planning to do a pan roast party at home, SOON!",

I usually always get the combo pan roast. Its like a bisque with seafood and spicy.Comes with rice so that helps with the spice. I have once tried the bouillabaisse  and it was also tasty the broth was lighter compared to the pan roast. I have also had the clam chowder which is also good. We always get a dozen of their oyster, I mean what can you say about oyster other than delicious.",

I went first time with my girlfriend after reviewing on Yelp, then I have been back every time I am in Vegas regardless of the wait time. Yes, you have to wait a long time due to the limited seating, but the wait is well worth it! Don't let the size and casino atmosphere fool you, this place offers the best seafood I have had in las Vegas for the price!!",

I really hate waiting in a restaurant but I decided to anyway.  After seating down, they took the drink order and the food order because I knew what I wanted.  After another 20 minutes later the food finally came out.  The pan roast had a very rich flavor.  It is good as other reviewers said but I'm not sure if I will wait 1 hour to get my food at the restaurant.  If you have time, make sure to visit here.  If you are in a rush, find a different restaurant.",

Everything was very flavorful and the oysters were delicious!!!  The only real drawback was the wait.   Expect to wait for an hour to two sometimes but you can't really blame this on them when  the food is so good. It's off the strip inside Palace station so you're going to have to take a taxi if you are staying on the strip.  The waitress and the chef Bob are very attentive.  They interact with the customers and are very fun to talk to. Definitely a must go to place if you like oysters and pan roast!!",

Oysters taste very fresh and decent size (not too tiny or meaty for me). The combo pan roast is a must-try! Nice and creamy/saucy goodness with rice and seafood is heaven! The etouffee was also delicious. You can choose your level of spiciness from 1-10. I enjoy spice just a tad and a 4 was quite spicy. Still enjoyable though. Portions are quite large. 12 oysters and a pan-roast combo with rice easily fills 2 people up with moderate appetite. Unless you want left-overs, order your own.  The service is always great the past 5-6 times I've came here.  Wait time can be a bummer of minimum 30-60 mins. But this place is open 24-hours so maybe try going during off-peak meal hours.  There are no more than 20 seats and it is sitting directly within the casino slots.I don't know other chefs that work the front counter, but Bob is a pretty funny guy.",

The orange creamy soup is pretty flavored and salty (extra salty because of the seafood) so it's best to scoop a spoon full on top of your rice, like curry, and eat it that way. Or eat it with bread. Gumbo is ok, I don't like that too much. Oysters are always fresh and delish. The shooters are even better.   The wait is long. Sometimes over an hour long. But it's worth the wait. Trust. Set up is a bar, about 14 stools. Waiting for your food takes a while too since there is only one server and one cook. Sometimes the cook is the one doing all the work. So be patient.   Service is great here. Cooks are always interactive and fun. Our cook gave our party of 7 oyster shooters because it was my cousin's birthday on the house. Awesome service!  Enjoy.",

Supposedly, we were grouped up into the \"clubbers\" crowd, hence the prolonged wait. It's a small bar that can fit about 15 people or so. Everything is cooked to order which adds about 30 more minutes to the process on top of your eating time. If you see that line like 5 or 7 people long, expect that to be about an hour wait. For us well, let's say we had 4 people in front of us, but as we got closer more and more came from the woodwork....2 hour wait. 1 hour eat time...you are in for a commitment here.  -=-Jambalaya-=- I got this here at 10/10 spicy. EL FUEGO. EL Perfecto. Although, most others that tried this plate couldn't handle the heat. They don't mess around here. The portions are huge. It's ideal to share, but you'll get hit with a sharing charge if you do so. Order another smaller entree like oysters, then share a big plate. You'll be all set.  -=-Pan Roast-=- All the seasonings for all the entrees are pretty much the same thing: your Louisiana style cajun. This pan roast was new vocabulary to me, but I was convinced to at least try this. Now, I won't stray again. Your pan roast is everything that your jambalaya is....with the added benefit of a creaminess that I can probably only attribute to either oyster sauce or wine, something to give the soup a creamier taste. White rice is served on the side. Mix together and you'll be full in about half a bowl.",

If you watch the chefs - some are taking his sweet a$$ed time (however, I heard his food tastes the best) and some would just burn yours (like mine, but still was delish!)  I'm not sure if it's because they don't have enough room and stuff - or what. We were about 10 ppl behind, but yet still took us about 2.5 hours before getting seated. Doesn't matter what time you show up, because there is always someone in line and  waiting and have been waiting. We got there around 12:30 am, didn't sit down and order until 4am.

I had the pan roast in three different places in socal, I've try ritters, the boiler, the kettle bar, and now FINALLY the oyster bar. The OG to the pan roast! I can finally say the oyster bar does beat them all in taste.... but they are VERY VERY similar. Oyster bar is very generous with their seafood though.   Wait time? Puck no... never again hahaha. I'm sticking with the pan roast around my area in SoCal. Anyways we were probably the 3rd group in line.. and the wait was almost 2 HOURS. I over heard some guest saying that they're going to take their  sweet time eating so we can wait longer and the chef agreed to that... like who the ... does that?! LOL. This is literally why I minus a star.. it could have been a five star. But anyways, don't think if you're on the top of the line you're going to be seated quickly because you might not. The guy behind us was waiting by himself, then he goes PLUS 8..... like he had an whole group wondering off somewhere... I'm pretty sure the people behind him was pretty pissed off. I'm glad we were in front of him... but yeah if you don't want a wait or a short wait come at 5AM-9AM! ( It opens 24 HOURS ) Some couple was trying to pay us $20 to cut the line too.. hahaha, uhm no LOL.   Now for the food.. AMAZING! One dish can feed up to ( 1 - 2  people ) But if you're waiting that long why not order one each. If you don't finish take it togo!   Shared the Combo pan roast, Cioppino, and Alaskan Chowder.   $5.00 SHARING fee. Ugh, it's so amazing though... why you got to play us like that. Combo Pan Roast- The sauce and they spiciness is good, you get to pick an spice level of 1 - 10. We got 8 and it wasn't even that spicy LOL but to me I can handle a good enough spice. I would say 3 - 5  MILD,  6 - 8 is Medium, 9-10 HOT. Cioppino - Fish stew with seafood, if you like something soupy and light get this. I thought it was okay... at first we wanted to try the shrimp and lobster far dialo but the chef HIGHLY recommended the Cioppino..I don't think I would order this again. Alaskan Chowder- YES AND YES, please do order this. Best chowder ever...so much seafood and fresh clams! Overall the Combo Pan Roast is THE BEST!! never ever disappoint, if it's your first time get the combo pan roast!! Second will be Alaskan chowder!",

    "text": "What!!!... First timer here and I'm an instant fan. Yes, you'll have to wait unless you get lucky and seats open up when you arrive. But it's worth the wait! You have 24hr in a day to try it.   Really cool, hole-in-the-wall kinda place. Right in the middle of a low-mid range hotel/casino way off the strip, the Palace Station.   The food was excellent. As my first time here, my family recommended the Combo Pan Roast w/ shrimp, crab and lobster. I ordered mine with medium (#5) spiciness and included a scoop of white rice on top (you can ask for it on the side if you like). Also had shrimp cocktail and the dozen oysters in the half shell. Both were really tasty. The clam linguini my sis got looked amazing as well. Will have to try that one time. My friend got the manhattan clam chowder and mentioned that it was ok and a little salty for his taste.   They also offer clams on the half shell, gumbo, jambalaya, clam chowder and more! Drool. Check out the specials on beer and drinks. An oyster shooter menu looked too good.   Service was friendly and attentive. The chef had the process down. It was entertaining watching him work as he prepared the meals in front of you. They also didn't rush you through your meal, as seeing there are only 18 seats. I don't recommend large parties, as it may be tough to get everyone seated at one time.  I'm eager to go back and try more dishes. If you like seafood, this is a must-go-to.",

If you come in late night around 10pm-12am there's not much of a wait, maybe just a few minutes.  However if you come in mid day to 8pm except at least an hour wait or so to get seated.  But hey it's busy for a reason!  I love oysters before my meal so it's  important to me that they are always fresh, which they are! All the while you meal is prepared right in front of you.  The best plate I would say for me and my friends is the Pan Roast. There's no way to describe it other than just amazing!!!  Adding sausage makes it just that much better. =)   I've also had the Gumbo and Jumbalaya and they're  arguably just as good, especially if you like more of a creamy texture.    Vegas experience I think every local has to try at least once!!",

    "text": "So so good!!!  Every time I venture out to the good 'ol sin city, I always make sure I get my Oyster Bar fix before I head back home.  This place is super super small, sitting only about 18 or so people in a bar seating restaurant. When I first came here, it was some time ago during dinner and I remember the line was stretching out towards the slot machines. I waited for maybe a good 30-40 minutes realizing we haven't moved an inch!! We decided to eat elsewhere and come back when it wasn't so busy. The second time I came during lunch on a weekday. Thank God there were only a couple of people waiting and we were able to get seated quick.   If you do go during weekends during rush hours, be prepared to wait...FOR HOURS!! Go on a weekday or odd hours since this place is 24 hours!  So far, I've only tried their combo pan past and palace pan roast. But, I think that's pretty much the only thing you should order!! The pan roasts are sooo good! The bf ordered a jambalaya one time but throughout the night kept taking bites of my pan roast that he decided to just stick with pan roast from there on after.  The best deal is to just share a pan roast for $5 extra so that way you can order other appetizers when you come. (:  I'm not much of a raw oyster person but the oysters here are no joke FATTT! Those suckers are so freaking huge I was shocked at the person next to me being able to eat a whole dozen by himself. If you like oysters, I guarantee you'll enjoy the oysters here at Oyster Bar.   Overall, I really enjoying eating at the Oyster Bar.  Not only is the food super good but I really like the small intimate setting.  I have so far met 3 out of the 5 chefs that are regulars here and I enjoy conversing with them while I eat my pan roast.  Depending on the chef that is working, be careful at how spicy you make your pan roast.  I ordered a 7 with one chef my last pan roast and it was perfect.  And then I ordered a 7 with a different chef and it was SPICY. It was my first meal of the day and I felt like there was a hole burning through my stomach!   The hotel on the other hand is not as great. Very sad and depressing.  I had a couple of randos come up to me while waiting in line and talk to me about Jesus. Interesting. But I feel the setting just makes Oyster Bar that much more special.",

    "text": "Went to the Oyster bar on a Tuesday about 6pm. waited in line for about a 1/2 hour. The seating is very limited. about 15 chairs at the Oyster Bar. I assume they constantly have a line and you can easily wait up to an hour, in line. The night we went , they had 1 cook and 1 cashier. We ordered a drink and fresh oysters to start. The Oysters were pretty good and the beer was cold and the bread was warm. About 30 minutes later our food came. My lobster roast had plenty of lobster and it had a good flavor, The other dish had way to much chicken and not enough seafood, it was average. Normally I would have given them a three, but the cook and the cashier were really busting their ass to get the food out, shuck oysters, serve drinks, clean the bar, do refills and seat people. And they were doing it with a smile. The supervisor  came around several times and say them in the weeds and kept going.[What a twit]. I think if they had another worker, everything would be excellent and they wouldn't have to rush everything and constantly run their ass off non stop. So many of the casinos are really cutting back and its really killing the place. If my employees get slammed, I am right in the middle of it busting my tail with them. Not standing back like some managers and ignoring the problem.",

    "text": "From the Wynn, we ask cab to take us to the best seafood in town.  So, westbound on Sahara we go..not knowing wth to expect..two minutes later, we see the Spearmint Rhino drawing near on the horizon...definitely smelled like seafood..and looked like an abalone was wedged in between everyone's legs.  Actually, a friend of ours (thanks Fred) recommended this place to us for literally years so we finally decided to experience it for ourselves.  Upon arrival, we find bar seating only, which is limited to roughly 20 stools.  I heard/read at peak points during the day the wait is about an hour but the 2 consecutive nights we came, 5am and 6am respectively, there was no wait at all.    Great time to end the night or start the day.  Open 24 hours.  They also take phone orders.  Both mornings fellow yelper and pal Chris K treated the boys to the combo roast (lobster, crab, shrimp) at spice level 8/10.  The dish is a tomato based bisque/puree and for my palate wasn't spicy enough but heavenly nonetheless.  One combo roast is definitely enough for two, so order accordingly.  It takes about 10-15 minutes for the dish to arrive but time flew as we watched Ricardo the filipino prepare it before our very eyes.  Ricardo and an elderly caucasian gentlemen, who resembles Syracuse's Jim Boeheim, are probably the coolest cats in town.   Be especially vigilant while Ricardo generously pours what he calls \"heavy cream.\"  For all I know, it is liquefied crack (coined by Brian J).  Portions are generous and accompanied by (unlimited?) steamed white rice and warm sourdough rolls.  I will never go to another buffet in Vegas ever again, I'd rather eat here 3x...a day.",

We arrived there at about 11:30am on Sunday and the line didnt look too bad...probably about 2 groups of people in front of us (like 7-8 people). We ended up waiting for an hour before we were seated. Once we were seated, the chef served us some rolls and the server took our order pretty quickly.   We ordered the combo pan roast and alaskan chowder. It's pretty cool to watch the chef, Bob cook right in front of us. I can't believe he's the only one cooking for all 20 people. He has been working non-stop during his shift. I didn't even see him taking any breaks at all. He cooks, cleans, buses tables, shucks oysters/clams. He does everything! He's simply amazing! Not to mention the food he made were absolutely delicious. Definitely worth the wait and will go back again. Two thumbs up.",

We came back at 10pm after an aweful dinner at Bouchon and waited maybe 20mins.  Food: You have a selection of heat level of 1-10 for entrees.  I would recommend that you get under 5 especially if you get the gumbo.  The heat overpowers a lot of the dish and you wouldn't want an accident at the club or on the can LOL 1. Oysters (1 dozen) - Very very fresh 2. House Gumbo - Heat level 7.  The flavor was awesome but since it was soupy.  The heat intensifies after each spoon.  I would probably get a 1 or 2 next time.  Wish it came with more rice. 3. Palace Pan Roast - Heat level 5.  The most popular dish was also the best dish.  The shellfish, crab, shrimp, sausage + ingredients tasted like the sea.  Hearty, creamy, almost soulful but the heat overpowers everything.  I too would get this again but in 2-3. 4. Linguine alla Vongole - Heat level 7.  The linguine was cooked perfectly.  The calms and sauce was a good balance but the heat again awakened my senses.  I would imagine this dish being light at a 2-3 in heat level. 5. Bread - nothing special but free 6. Shocktop Beer - light beer with a hint of orange.  Great for the summers.  Nice cold beer to cool down with all that heat.    If your a beer drinker and plan on coming back, I would highly recommend that you buy the 24oz glass.  Bring back the glass and you only pay 1/2 on refills.  If you haven't tried the beers, the waiter will gladly let you sample and small glass for free.",

It's 24 hours so I'd laugh my ass off if 3 in the morning there is a line for a Combo Pan Roast which is what I had for my main course. I ate oysters as well since I love good oysters. It's the taste of the ocean and the slippery, spicy lemony flavor that you don't normally get. For a brief moment I feel like I'm on a tropical island.  The bowl is deep and the soup is full of flavor. Every spoonful has that slow roasted, seafood flavor that can satisfy your taste buds. I enjoyed it so much that I didn't slow down and burned the roof of my mouth.   I like that it's Vegas, 24 hours, drink and/or smoke while waiting in line. I'm not a smoker but I won't begrudge you if you light up.   The chef and waitress' are really hard workers because they were describing how the day goes. It can be really busy or just consistent but rarely empty. I would eat here for breakfast if you really hate the lines. I'm ASSUMING it's pretty slow in the mornings.",

The hot roasts we so good and easily shared between 2 or as great leftovers.  Rich and filling. So much flavor, can't wait to go back!  Didn't try the oysters though, doh!",

We went on a weekday (wednesday night) and waited at least 30 minutes to be seated.  Don't let appearances fool you because the food is amazing!  I had the pan roast and it was delicious.  Generous serving for the price.  Well worth the wait.  Will come back and eat again.  Not a place for big parties because seating is very limited, I believe only 24 bar seats.  But you must try at least once and you will be hooked.",

While my mom and I were dining at the delicious TC's Rib Crib we started talking to a couple and their friend sitting next to us about great places to eat in Vegas and they all agreed that the \"Oyster Bar\" @ Palace Station was the next best place to try in Vegas.  We stood on line for 45 minutes but it was so worth the wait. We ordered oysters first then shared the gumbo in which you can add as much heat to it as you can stand and it was loaded w/crab, shrimps and lobster. You can any of the seafood items your selected dish. I also love that they cook it right there before you.   New Orleans WATCH out.... The portions are healthy, so you can share.  We both decided it would be the 1st place we're eating at  the next time we're in Vegas and we wouldn't share either. LOL",

    "text": "I really want to give the Oyster Bar a Bad Review. We have been coming here for many years now and the lines and wait keeps getting longer and longer. Waited in line 2 hours last night, longest ever.  Was think a couple of really bad reviews would shorten that line up pretty quick. But I cannot tell a lie. This place is GREAT. Every time we are in town we head straight to this place from the airport. Even though we are NOT LOCALS, the cooks and waitresses recognize us. Normally we order raw oysters and raw clams to start. Then order the House Gumbo. If we come more than once during our stay, we branch out to other items on the menu. Normally order a 7 on the gumbo. I think that Bob is the one with the heavy hand with the spice, so be careful. His 7 is more like an 8 or even 9. I think if you order a 7 on the pan roast it's not as spicy because of the cream.  If you are in the Palace Station give it a try. But please be kind to the rest of us and know what you want when you sit down and eat quickly. I've had a lot of great conversations with people in line, but would gladly give them up in favor of shorter lines.",

It was really good and quite pricey, but that was okay. I shared my soup with two others, so it did not cost me too much. I also got the oysters. I don't know if it's me and my dislike for eating oysters, I just thought the oysters were unimpressive.   Quite honestly, I want to return to Vegas strictly for the soup :) This time, maybe I should buy some and bring it back and I might even try other things :}",

    "text": "We live in Las Vegas and have been coming to Oyster bar for over 20 years. Less and less over the last 3 years. What is the reason? Bad management!! Do not get me wrong, the food is good and because it attracts many clients the management does not care about customer experience. Instead of providing would be diners with a place to sit down and wait or giving customers pagers to let them know the seats are available, the management makes people stand in line often for more than 45 minutes. This is the reason we just stopped going there. I stopped by today at 4 P.M. hoping there would not be a line since it is too early for dinner. Sure enough as I arrived there were only a couple of ladies waiting. There were 4 or 5 seats available at the oyster bar but the employees did not bother to acknowledge the customers and clean those spots so the clients could sit down. I stood there for about 10 minutes before I asked an employee why the seats were not being available for the people standing and waiting. He did not give a *hit as I could tell. A few minutes passed and I asked to speak to a manager. Meanwhile the 2 ladies who were ahead of me finally had enough and just left the queue. When the manager showed up and I told him what was wrong with the operation he proceeded to tell me that most time customers wait in line for an hour and a half... Is this how you address concerns ? If I was your boss you'd be fired. Bad service reflects first and foremost on management. Employees will do as they are directed and taught to do. So 2 thumbs up for the chef and 2 thumbs down for the rest of the operation. I will rather go to the Shack on W. Flamingo and be treated with respect and lower prices.",

It was about 6am and we still had to wait about 30-40 minutes before we began seating. Serious?! YES, it's THAT GOOD!! Not only that, the bar sits only about 15-20 people, maybe not even that much. It is definitely worth the wait in my opinion!  I ordered the palace pan roast the first time. Hands down that meal is to die for!!! I wanted to lick the bowl clean! It is seafood filled in a yummmmy yummmy delicious soupy gooodness!!!! It has shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausages!! I like to order my pan roast with the rice on side as it helps to keep the rice from getting too soggy. You can watch the cooks prep your food and you see everything that goes into it. My stomach growls as I wait and when I get my order I am so giddy and ready to eat!  I also tried the oysters on the half shell. You can sit and watch them as they shuck the oysters. You know it's going to be yummy!! The jambalaya was yummy also. Also, order yourself a bowl of the clam chowder!!! It's just some of the best I've had - so creamy!!  Give yourself a chance to experience some of this delicious goodness!! You will want to come back again and again!",

Lately they seem to be a little arrogant with actions such as a five dollar share fee and also how they take their sweet time cleaning spots even though they can see people have been waiting over and hour to sit down.   I took two korean business partners there this weekthat were here for business. We waited an hour and a half at 7 pm on a thursday night. They were getting antsy but i kept telling them it was worth the wait.   Upon sitting down one of the giys ordered three ouster shooters. As he drank his first one he pulled a three quarter inch piece of jagged glass out of his mouth. We reported it and the waitress confirmed there was some broken glass in by the glasses. The waitress very curtly said \"are you ok? We can call an ambulance and have you checked bu a paramedic, thats what we are offering you\"   It just seemed very insensitive. They comped only his meal and we had to waste a bunch of time with security filling out a report.  All in all i was very embarrased by the experience and will never go bck, despite the fact that i love the pan roast.",

The oysters, clam chowder, pan roast, jambalaya, cioppino, gumbo, everything is really good. Each time we come here we end up ordering too much food, really one pan roast is enough for two people. But no, we like to polish off a dozen oysters on the half shell, share a bowl of chowder and then each order an entree. Egad.   I will say this, it is kind of expensive. The portions are huge but as I said before, we cannot control ourselves and end up ordering too much food and the bill turns out to be bloody expensive. But it's so good!",

I stepped in line (which really is just...a makeshift line in the middle of the casino floor) and...waited. It was a bit late, so there wasn't that much of a line and we ended up only waiting for about 30 minutes. We struck up conversation with the couple in front of us, who also happened to be from California. We got seated and perused the menu. Small menu, so we made our choices pretty quickly.  1) I will say that the service is a bit on the slower side. One server and two cooks. 2) The food was awesome. You'd never think it, but the food is in total contrast to the looks of the place. 3) Even though the service was a bit slow, we had a fun time joking around with the staff. The banter between us made up for the slow service and made the night that much more enjoyable.  The food was great. We pretty much licked everything clean. There was one thing that was even more amazing, though...So we look across the bar, and there was this girl that just could not stop eating. She was at her seat with her boyfriend from the time we took our spot in line until after we had finished up and left. From my estimation, she probably ate about $120 worth of food and beer all by herself. The funniest part is that her boyfriend only had one dish, some oysters and a soda. My girlfriend and I were so amazed that this was the only thing we could talk about the whole cab ride back to the hotel. The look on the boyfriend's face plus his body language when he received the bill was priceless!",

You don't get the experience of sitting at the Oyster Bar but will definitely get you through until your next visit.

Pan roast recipe  2 table shallots 2 table green onions 4 garlic cloves 1 tomato Brandy to deglaze 1 tea thyme 1 tea paprika 1/2 tea old bay 1/2 tea butter 1/4 tea salt Pepper and white 2 tea Worcestershire 2 tea Tabasco 2 tea cocktail sauce 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 bottle clam juice 1/2 Onion 1 celery stalk  Sauteed garlic, onions and shallots w olive oil, deglaze with butter.   Add dry seasonings and tomato w Worcestershire, Tabasco, salt, pepper. Deglazing w clam juice (reserve some for later).   Simmer, add brandy and blend until smooth.   Stir in heavy cream. Set aside  Sauteed celery and onions w olive oil. Add in shrimp and whatever seafood you want, deglaze w clam juice until cooked. Top off the brandy (2 teas per serving). Stir in bisque mixture, Serrano chili and chili flakes, tiny sprinkle of lemon juice. Bring To boil. Serve with parsley sprinkled on top like they do at the real deal.   Makes 2 servings.

There is only seating for about 14 people at a time so if you want to be seated you must wait in line from 20 mins to past an hr. There is only 1 chef and he makes everything in front of you. The menu is pretty extended. My favorite was the combo pan roast. I also tried the barbecued shrimp and of course the oysters! Definitely coming back when in vegas next time.

We started with Oyster shooters.  They went down quickly while we watched the chef prepare our chowder and gumbo.  My Alaskan New England seafood chowder ($17.99) was full of large shrimp, lobster, and plentiful flaked snow crab along with heavy cream as a thickener rather than potatoes.  This simply could not have been better.  My wife had the Combo Pan Roast ($21.99) chocked full of shrimp, crab, and lobster in a creamed tomato base with brandy and a portion of rice.  Hard to believe but it had more seafood than she could eat!  Both items we had are meal sized.  Food is cooked right at the counter using small portion sized steam jacketed kettles.  It's a gentle way to cook and very appropriate for the best quality seafood.  The cooking method makes for slow deliberate service but the time spent zooms by watching the cooking and with banter from the chef , server and customers.  This was one of the best meals we've ever eaten.  They have 15 to 20 counter seats only (this is not fine dining, just fine eating) and are open 24 hours a day.  Just another reason you gotta love Vegas.",

Fortunately, we visited this place on a Tuesday afternoon and sat down right away..  I hear that the lines are long and since it is a limited seating bar, people wait over an hour to get a seat.  Chef, tells us that due to huge interest , it is now open 24/7  When we got to the bar, he suggested two choices. Combo Roast or Alaskan Chowder.  I went for the Combo roast., 5 on the spicy meter. , I first admired the chef creating the meal using the unique kitchen tools.  All the soups are heated by steam device  right in front of you.  Quick service  After a a few spoonfuls, OMG this is awesome.  Shared some with a friend who had the Alaskan chowder,  I needed it  back!  Very savory, dish, perfect spice, Scoop of steam rice in the soup  was just what I needed,  Tender Crab, Shrimp and lobster filled every spoonful.  I watched other patrons ask for their left overs to go.  I couldn't stop!  I found myself smiling as I devoured this delectable dish.    I didn't get any oysters or house favorites, no room for that!  If you  like Creole style food, you MUST try this place next time you are in Vegas.  Now I know why my buddy visited this bar 4 times during a week-long stay in Vegas!",

He kept talking to this one specific customer about his WHOLE life and did not even greet me nor other customers. Besides that, when my food was ready, he poured it out and just stood there to talk to the customer for abt 5mins instead serving them over to me. This isnt the first time experiencing it, there was also another time when I was in line and he just wont stop talking. He stopped what he was doing and stood there to talk nonstop. Like hello! Theres a long line and a lot of people were waiting, that talking need to quit unless you can talk and keep your hand moving!",

I had the New England Clam Chowder and the Combo Pan Roast after waiting approximately 45 minutes. Both soups were hearty and full of flavor and sea food.   Located in the heart of the Palace Station Casino, the Oyster Bar feels extremely out of place, adjacent to slot machines, the bingo counter and smoking tourists. Worst of all is the line situation--hungry people are basically staring at the diners eating at the bar. Seeing as there are only about 25 seats and the cooks stagger seating in such a way that you're likely to wait 45 minutes-3 hours to sit down. This means that before you eat, it's likely that you'll be intently watching those presently eating, urging them to  eat faster. And once you sit down, you know the people behind you are thinking the same thing about you. The entirety of the dining experience was enough to prevent me from returning, but the food was quite tasty.",

Must try their pan roast; the sauce mixing with jambalaya is a killer! I still give it a 5-star even when our waiting time was 90 minutes.

We've never had that chef before. The service was so unbelievably slow last night. Usually they are moving super quick and the seats are cleared and the next set of people are in them in no time. Half the bar was empty at one point and they hadn't even cleaned one of those seats. They asked us what we wanted to drink and I ordered a Sierra Mist, my husband ordered a beer. He finished his beer before the food was done so he asked for water and asked them to refill my Sierra Mist and they refilled it with water. The chef served our food and after pouring it into the bowls he cleaned the excess drops off the rim of the bowl, but then pushed my bowl towards me and it spilled over the side. The pan roast which is usually REALLY delicious was off last night and then just before we left the chef dropped the rice bucket back into its container and splashed my husband and I with water, he didn't even apologize or anything and just kept on with what he was doing. The waiter or whatever he is saw me wiping myself off with a napkin and asked what happened and when my husband told him the chef dropped the rice in there, then the chef apologized. The customer next to me had a shocked look on his face. The experience was definitely garbage. I'm truly glad it wasn't the first experience or we'd never go back. But, if you are looking for an exceptionally delicious seafood dish, this is the place to go. Maybe call in and find out if Ricardo is working first. He's really good and keeps you laughing. Sadly, our favorite chef is no linger there.",

My oh my, I have been hooked since going here and forgot all about the other places I usually go to. I tried to go now weekly around midnight ( that's right, no lines, hehe) if I can and already ordered almost everything on the menu. All time fave must be the Combo Pan Roast and Seafood Jambalaya. The Pan Roast has that creamy and very tasty soup and with the seafood that's mixed in it, it literally feels like food heaven. Seafood Jambalaya is presented well and is a winner itself. You can never go wrong with anything that you'll order.   Since it's an 18-seater bar, be ready to wait during regular business hours.

The staff were very nice and you get to watch your food being made. It's a hidden gem.",

    "text": "I made it a priority to come here after reading the glowing reviews on yelp. Did Oyster Bar live up to the hype... Hells yeah!!  My guy and I started off with a dozen oysters which were pretty small but ok. I then ordered the combo pan roast... AWESOME!! It was a creamy tomato based seafood stew with lobster, crab and shrimp. It's served in a huge bowl with a scoop of rice. The flavor was rich and full of ocean goodness. I seriously had a 'wtf' moment and declared Palace Station as one of my must go places when I come to Vegas.  You get to pick your spice level from 1 to 10. I got a 7 which was great for me but be warned they don't mess around. My bf's etouffee was an 8 and it left my mouth pretty hot for awhile.  If you don't want to wait in line come here during the week at a weird time. We went on a Wed at 3 and sat down right away. Bob the chef told me there is an hour and a half wait on weekends.  Bottom line: If you are looking for a delicious and original seafood sensation... Oyster Bar is for you!!",

    "text": "I love this place and whenever I am in Vegas I make sure I stop by this Oyster Bar for House Gumbo and Bouillabaisse.   They have hands down one of the best I've ever tasted.  I just came back from New Orleans and I still think this place is as good if not better!    It's a hidden gem of Las Vegas.  The wait  is worth it.  Usually if you go in the evening (any day of the week) it's at least a 45 minute wait.  The wait helps you work up a good darn appetite.  There are two chefs and my favorite chef is JJ and he's usually working in the evening.   Things to try:  -Steam Little Neck Clams in butter garlic sauce -Bouillabaisse -House Gumbo -Ettouffe -Oysters ( There's a better place to get oysters, but it's not bad here either.   Remember to ask for rice on the side if you don't want them to mix it in your bouillabaisse or your gumbo.    They ask you how spicy you want your Bouillabaisse and Gumbo.  If you get both make sure your Gumbo is a tad spicer than the Bouillabaise.    Now sit back and enjoy the sounds of slot machines and the taste of Nawlins in Vegas!",

I am not even a lover of creole food, but I LOVE shrimp, and so I typically get a shrimp cocktail and the shrimp scampi (with rice instead of pasta).  It's sort of a garlicy, lemony, white winey bowl of soupy goodness!    It's not the same if you try and save it and take it home, so my husband and I typically go to Vegas on Saturday morning, eat at the Oyster bar for lunch, dinner, and then lunch the next day before we hit the road.    It may sound crazy, but we have tried to find ANYTHING even comparable in Southern California, and can't!  Not even close.    I'm a great cook, and even I can't reverse engineer what I've had there.    I want more!  It's been a few months, and I think I'm going to have to go this weekend.  I guess the baby is going to spend the night with Grandma!",

    "text": "(4.5 / 5) Stars.  Much thanks to fellow Yelpers.  This place is awesome. We ordered the Combo pan roast (A MUST), and the palace seafood jambalaya. The smell and watching them make the dishes are an appetizer themselves. We sat there drooling as the interesting heating bowls cooked our food.   The Pan Roast was definitely the winner between the two dishes. It was chockful of shrimp, lobster, and crab pieces. The gravy was similar to a very velvety, almost buttery smooth concoction of tomato cream soup. The jambalaya was good as well but it doesn't hold up in a match against the Roast. Our only complaint is the single scoop of rice you get with it. They charge 2.50 for extra rice. We're asian, and we love our rice!   Definitely hitting this place again when I head back to Vegas. Highly recommended for their Roast.",

    "text": "You know how you can tell if a Vegas casino is ghetto? There are a couple of tell tale signs. First, when you step in, do you feel like you've just stepped into a Reno casino?  That's a dead giveaway. Second, the sports book still uses a white board to display all of its bets. Really? I mean in this day and age of LCDs and what not, your tool of choice is a dry erase and a white board? Finally, look at the table minimums, if they offer any table games at $5 stakes or less, it's probably a ghetto casino. Palace Station fits the bill on all 3 counts. Despite all this, we decided to check out an eatery within the casino called the Oyster Bar.  There are a couple of things you need to know about the Oyster Bar before you go. First, they take no reservations, it's first come first served. Which wouldn't be a problem normally, but this place is literally a bar. It's a counter surrounding the kitchen area and there are 18 seats. Yes, that's a one and an eight. So right away you know you're going to be standing in line because turnaround is a little slow. And really, don't try to get seated if you have more than 4 people in your party because they have to leave those seats open to make space for 4 and that will just piss the people off in line. Second, don't try to do the Asian thing of ordering it to go, they don't serve to go orders. Finally, you are only allowed to order 1 entree per person, so like Indiana Jones in the Last Crusade, you must choose wisely.  We had 5 people in our group so we had to break up into a 2 and a 3 so that one group could watch the baby while the other ate. I ended up with the baby daddy and we were going to eat second after the other group. So there I am waiting in line for a good hour and a half to eat, staring suspiciously at anyone who approaches the counter to see if they are trying to do a seat swap or not. The Oyster Bar is right in the middle of the casino with slot machines like 5 feet away. So of course I had to play some $1 Wheel of Fortune slots. Thanks to the wait, baby daddy and I dropped $24 each in the slots and didn't win jack. At this point, I'm thinking this better be the best food I ever eat.  Finally we get seated and look over the menu. They have a varied selection of seafood specialties such as pan roasts, ciopinnos, gumbo, jambalaya, bouillsbaisse, and an etouffee. They also had both kinds of clam chowder and some shellfish selections. I start of with 3 Bloody Mary oyster shooters (got mine with Absolut, but you can also select Jose as your shot of choice). The shooters were delicious, oysters were huge and juicy, not gritty and not too milky. Good start to the meal. I decided on the Combo Pan Roast (Crab, Shrimp, and Lobster). You get to choose how spicy you want it cooked on a scale of 1-10 (they also had habanero, which presumably is about a 15, but I politely declined). I ordered a 10 and when the woman next to me asked the chef, Megan, how hot a 10 was, Megan grabbed 2 fistfuls of red hot chili flakes and threw them in. Then she threw in another pinch for good measure, to the horrified look of the lady next to me. The seafood was all fresh, the flavors infused into the shrimp and crab and lobster from having been simmered for a long time. The heat was good, not overbearing as to mask the flavor of the pan roast, but enough so that I left sweaty and snorting fire.  Minus 1/2 star for making me wait an hour and a half. Minus 1/2 star for making me lose $24 at the $1 Wheel of Fortune slots.",

I ordered the combo pan roast, it really is a bisque with cream, brandy and fish stock.  It had lobster, crab and shrimp.  All the seafood was de-shelled.  Being a big bowl of bisque, the pan roast is really rich.  With the accompanying rice, it really adds up to be a substantial meal.  My friend chose  the Bouillabaisse over the Cioppino, the difference being the former had some lobster in addition to mussels, clams and fish that the Cioppino has,  The fish stock in the Bouillasbaisse was very good and the seafood was plentiful.   My other friend had the gumbo, the colour was a dark brown.  While the seafood and the okra was fine in the dish,  The taste was little unsual and not to our liking.  Our recommendation go or the bouillabaisse if you want something lighter with clean flavours, or go with the pan roast for something richer.  Avoid the gumbo.",

I went there around 330am and waited about an hour or so in line and another hour until I actually took my first bite. is it worth the wait? sure why not? cuz I don't think your E going to get a dish like this anywhere else in Vegas. it was more of an experience for me than anything else, but the food was great too.   the food: it's all about the combo pan roast. crazy tomato based soup with crab, lobster, and shrimp. it's goodness in a bowl. I highly recommend that to anyone that comes here. My friend had the gumbo.... It wasn't as good as the pan roast. I got it at level 10 spicy. it definitely had a kick and while it didn't drown out the flavor I needed a glass of water after every bite. next time I'm going to get it at around level 5. although I do lot eat oysters, people that had them said they were the best and freshest they've ever had.   only downside is the wait because it can take a whole depending on your timing. there were people ahead of me that were waiting for 2 hours. overall I recommend this place.",

My usual -  Half dozen oysters, and a combo pan roast (spicy # 6)  There is only counter seating at the Oyster and it is located on the casino floor next to the Broiler.   More than likely you'll roll up to a line, but don't bail! It's so worth the wait, and the wait can be real long! There are no reservations to be made, and there are maybe a total of 12-15 seats at the counter. Since it's now open 24-7 you can often time it right and not wait that long.   The food is always dead on, and so comforting. Big chucks of seafood and a scoop of rice in a tomato based giant bowl of goodness.   Dining at the Oyster Bar is always fun. JJ one of the cooks, has been there forever. They make your food, and shuck the oysters right in front of you. As an added bonus, there's always some interesting, & crazy casino folk @ Palace Station to people watch while your enjoying your pan roast of choice.",

Didn't seem like a bad thing, until you realize there is only 20 seats.  No tables, just a bar.  We were warned that our wait would be over an hour.  That was enough for me to change my mind.  But the folks in front of us told us that it was worth the wait.  So we waited.  And we waited.  The line really didn't seem to move at all.  After a god long time, we finally got the front position and still had to wait another 15 minutes.  This place better be good.  OMG, it was.  Wait.  I'm not kidding, Wait.  It was super amazing  I have eaten in a lot of great places in Vegas.  A lot.  This may be on the top of my list.  I was truly blown out by the flavors.  We all ordered different dishes, so it gave me the ability to sample most of them.  They all were equally great.  I can't wait to return, even if I have to wait an hour and half again.",

Pan roast with crab, shrimp and lobster ($20) - 5 stars. MUST GET. comes with rice but my boyfriend asked if we could get half noodles half rice.  - I prefer the rice with it more but it was nice to taste both and he didnt charge us  My boyfriend and I split all of these items and left full. This place is by far one of my favorite places to eat in las vegas.",

It has Shrimp, Crab and Lobster in a delicious soup! Finishing the Pan Roast makes me want to eat it more and I can still taste its goodness after hours.   Pro: They have delicious Combo Pan Roast. Get it.  Con: I'm kicking myself for not going there the first 3 days I was at Palace Station. The wait is long. The line formed at 10:20am on Sunday for me.   Good tip: Get there before 10:20am or else you will wait long in line!  For anyone who loves the Oyster Bar but went back home to SoCal, Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking has their food too!",

    "text": "We made it finally!  Waited for about an hour which was understandable due to the high volume of people and servers slow to bus seats.    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=e4aS4UGEyTreqJ6XbbfVxA#VEWUm4gsL2vxexjn1RRvHQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4...</a>  We immediately order the Crab Cakes after hearing another patron complimenting them; I have to say they were delicious! Fresh Crab Cake in a bitter sauce diminished our hunger and made us forget about the long wait.  Definitely a must order if you visit this Oyster Bar.  If you don't like bitter tasting sauce, I would suggest ordering the Crab Cakes without sauce. I thought the sauce complimented them very well and enjoyed every bite.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=e4aS4UGEyTreqJ6XbbfVxA#PlW9Yo2sSLw3o-AWxhrM0g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4...</a>  Our other two items Oysters and Gumbo which are a \"no brainer\" for my wife and I since it's what we order every visit.  Now, we've been here about three or four times but haven't visited in a couple years.    First up, a Dozen Oysters.  Oysters were very fresh and well chilled and went perfectly with the condiments provided.  Our only big complaint was the oysters were pretty tiny.  You probably can't tell by looking at the picture, but the meat just wasn't there and it's not something you can really complain about.  So pretty disappointed with the Oysters.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=e4aS4UGEyTreqJ6XbbfVxA#GlpImK1DGy5sU5iZNjVOoA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4...</a>   Next up, House Special Gumbo which comes with lobster, shrimp, sausage and crab.  Spicy level 7 (out of 10).  Gumbo was pretty tasty, fish was delicious as was the sausage.  However, my wife and I noticed that previous visits in the past they used to give us whole pieces of cut sausage.  Now, they cut the sausage into four 1/4 pieces giving you less sausage.  Not a huge deal but it could make one wonder what other ingredients (seafood) they dialed back in your gumbo.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=e4aS4UGEyTreqJ6XbbfVxA#e4aS4UGEyTreqJ6XbbfVxA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4...</a>  In the past I would give this place 4-5 stars easily but due to my dishes coming up a little short with a hefty price tag gives it only a satisfactory.  Which is a shame because my wife and I would talk about this oyster bar every visit to sin city.  Now we have a \"eh\" attitude and will probably look for a different oyster bar to try.",

You would think that they would have above par oysters being that the restaurant name is themed around that particular item! The infamous pan roast happened to be one of the items I ordered and it was exactly what I anticipated  it to be! VERY GOOD! Filling and rather tasteful :-) I got a medium but i think I'll do more spicy the next time! Clam chowder is a hit! I wish it would've been hotter though! The location inside the Texas is much less busy!",

Don't be a chump by getting their chowder, get the pan roast. Any option of the pan roast is amazing. They give you plenty of seafood, although the Asian in me thinks they could've given us one extra scoop of rice for free. The soup is absolutely amazing & flavorful. The seafood is incredibly fresh & everything about it just was so hearty. Talk about the perfect hangover cure. Portions are huge!!  Prices: It's pretty expensive, but it's worth it! $20 for the combo pan roast that comes with a scoop of rice & bread.  Service: Not too bad, can't really complain.  Environment: Palace Station is such a sad little casino. There were more people at the Oyster Bar at 4 AM than in the entire casino floor. I hope they don't run out of business anytime soon, because this place is delicious.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because watching them clean up the soup was disturbing & unsanitary...although I'm sure it's fine, it's just unappetizing to watch. Absolutely recommend this place.

It took around 1.5 hour before we actually got our food, including the waiting in line.  It was worth it.  We got the gumbo and the palace pan roast.  Flavors were extremely deep and rich.  Portions were large.  If we lived in the area, we would have definitely taken our left overs home with a nice scoop of rice.  Service was wonderful.  I don't know if I would wait 2-3 hours just to be seated when there really is a long line, but would definitely come and try more dishes when we visit in the future.  We had a couple that sat next to us and they had eaten there everyday during the 4 days they were there, and they said nothing they tried was less than spectacular.

While we are waiting in line, we chat with others who also say they come back to this place every time they can.

The meal I shared with my gf was as follows: 1/2 dozen oysters(Fresh and big), 3 bloody Mary oyster shooters, bowl of clam chowder(order the bowl it's 3 times the size of a cup), combo roast(lobster, crab, & shrimp and they loaded it up!), linguini & clams(plenty of clams and cooked just right).

I realize I don't write reviews on yelp but do value people's opinions and thus I feel this has to be written. I came to oyster bar for a late lunch after a morning of going around sema show and had a great eating experience and thought, wow a hidden gem off the strip inside palace station. I decided to come back for dinner which turned out to be a disaster. After waiting a hour in a half, I finally was seated but somehow they let a guy cut because he was a party of one. Now, customers are suppose to wait in line and it should not be the customers to voice concerns as this should be common business policy to let people cut in line. So because this guy made a scene, he was able to sit and choose to order three dozen oysters and three dozen clams and since there was only one person to shuck (sp?) the shells, everyone's order got held up. Now, to some, that might be okay but then when they forget to put my order of oysters in and don't put the stream rice on the side of my combo pan roast because they were worried about servicing the guy that cut in line, then there is a problem. This experience is definition of how people who complain and make a scene get their way at the expense of those people who follow the rules. OK, my rant is done.",

It only seats about 15-20 people around a bar like set-up with the chef cooking it in front of you.  Don't eat the bread they give you right away, because you'll need the room in your stomach for the huge serving they give you.  I love the gumbo here and usually love things pretty spicy, but I'm good with the 6-7 range on their -10 scale.  I don't like Palace Station, but because it's smaller, parking and getting to the Oyster Bar is a lot easier than in a larger casino.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about being there.",

Our party of 4 ordered the recommended combo pan roast, just imagine, we we're all starving and really enjoying the aroma of the cooked food.  Initially, the heavy cream didn't bother me, but being a True seafoodie and asian, it eventually felt too heavy for my taste.  This dish, also was mostly just soup and really lacked any decent crab meat, lobster meat, the only thing I could get a good bite on was the shrimp, which was only mediocre for vegas standard. This was pretty much a disappointment for everyone in my party.The atmosphere of the Palace Station didn't help either, I left the casino with smoke aroma in my hair throughout my day in vegas.  Overall, its much too pricey. But if you insist on going despite my review, at least make sure to share this order with someone and order a separate extra bowl of rice.  There is way too much soup and heavy cream.",

Luckily we went at about 2:00pm on a weekday so there were plenty of open seats at the bar.  I can see how there can be a waiting line because there are more seats at the bar than there are steam kettles to prepare the food.   My friend and I shared one bowl of the combo pan roast (which came with a scoop of white rice) and ordered an extra scoop of rice ($2.50 I believe) -- I shoulda asked if they had brown rice.  The food filled both of us up and was tasty but a little bit overcooked for my preference (nod to trini I.'s review).  The crab meat had distintergrated into the soup and the shrimps were the only proteins still recognizable -- I like my soups chunky.   I think their cooking method is interesting and would go back to watch, but the food was just OK not great.  I think this place would be better if they applied this cooking technique to other chunkier dishes like stews, pastas, and chilis.",

    "text": "I'm honestly shocked at how people in line complain about the wait in line. I've eaten here several times, spanning as far back as in the late 90's and have always gotten great food, great service, and YES, there's a wait due to the limited seating area. That's to be expected!!  My last visit here was during CES. I think anyone who lives in Vegas or has been in Vegas knows that CES week can be absolute hell in terms of the amount of people that are in town and how crowded restaurants can be. That being said, at 7PM on the first night of CES, our wait time was only 45 minutes. Anyone who has been to Oyster Bar enough times, knows that's nothing!!! I've been here during a regular weekday and have waited up to 2 hours. And still, there were two guys who were being obnoxiously rude, yelling out to patrons eating to \"hurry up! there are hungry people waiting\" and making rude comments about how slow the service was. *NOTE* DON'T BE THOSE PEOPLE!!! If you can't wait a minimum of an hour to be seated for food, don't waste your time standing in line and complaining the whole time. Go eat elsewhere!  Now with that out of the way, there isn't anything on the menu that isn't good. Raw oysters are always good, the clam chowder is a must for me (though I still need to try the Alaskan chowder). My husband always gets the Pan Roast (spice level at just 1) and I will sometimes get the shrimp scampi. We both love our dishes, although I will say that on my last visit, chef was a little heavy handed with the rosemary/thyme and it completely drowned out the flavors of my scampi.   Portions are HUGE and we never finish all our food...but it's so good we also never want to share.",

Thankfully I saw the sign that you can't sit at their 18 seat bar if your not over 21.  So I decided to go there and order several dishes to go so that my family and I can enjoy them somewhere more kid friendly.  So when I got there around 4pm on a monday there were about 7 people in front of us which translated to about an hour wait time.  I was so excited.  Dissecting their menus, researching their reviews for weeks!!!  Seeing that you can only order to go once you were seated.   So I ordered several dishes including their jambalaya, linguini,  oysters, clams, pan roast and other dishes excited to finally try them.  And was saddened to find out that many of their dishes (including jambalaya, oysters, pan roast, and clams) could not be ordered to go!!!! I was flabbergasted!!!!  I wished they would've specified as to which dishes could be taken to go and which could not.  That would've saved me so much time and heartache. Granted the people working behind the bar were kind and said they would keep me in the front of the line if my other party arrived.   But what was I gonna do with the 2 kids.  By then there were a good 25 people in line!!! I am so disappointed to not be able to try this place.  Just keep in mind!!!  Many of their dishes cannot be taken to go!!!!  I might try again in the future since this place is world famous.  But as of today my rating has to be a 1/5 since they never specified on their menu or their posters that these dishes cannot be taken out",

It can be quite frustrating waiting in line and seeing the chef jist waiting until a large order comes in to be more efficient in cooking, regardless of whom is already waiting and ordered.  Pro tip: don't come here of you're already starving, because you might not survive the wait! Send a guy to come early and save a spot for the group",

    "text": "Pricey for regulars, but first time goers on a trip or here for the first time through the word on the street, it's pretty great.  Vegans stay away, it's only pescatarian friendly.   This place is always a great spot.  I understand its seafood and in a casino restaurant, but it's a bit pricey.  All oyster bars are.  However, this is forsure the best oyster bar in any casino in town.    Ricardo and Melita, dish out great service.  Quick attentive, witty, kind, and efficient.  They need to recognize with a promotion or give raises and extra days off to them.  I think all the dishes are great, but the thing is, after coming here for years, it does go stale.  If they can add a new item that's just as well cooked, or if possible, make the existing dishes even better.  That'd be sweet.  Portions are great, most people wont finish an entree.    If you're antsy or want to kill time between meals or waiting in line while someone holds it for ya in your party, there are a lot of machines nearby.  Thursday til Sunday on the weekends late night til like 3am will be fricken busy, at times you're waiting for 1 hr plus!  I think overall, if the business stays unchanged it will he fine and continue to stay for many years with happy patrons.  But picky folks, locals here for many years, or health conscious folk that dont go for seafood wont like it.",

    "text": "Don't want to wait? Too bad. You'll miss an opportunity to try their amazing pan roast and oysters. If that's ok for you to pass on, go ahead. For me, it was the best oysters I've ever had. Most memorable to me thus far. I'm from Chicago and when you're in Midwest, oysters aren't most fresh. They're also tiny. But these at the Oyster Bar? O m g! I'd fly back just for those oysters! We initially ordered just one dozen for my husband and myself. I typically eat 1 or 2 and tell him I'm done. This time? Nope. I wanted a dozen of my own so I've ordered another round of dozen oysters. My husband says, \"I've never seen you eat oysters like that before.\" And he's right. I don't. Why? Not because I don't necessarily like them; apparently it's because I haven't had good ones!!!!   An entire dish of pan roast was a little too much for me. Too much, as in the size. I could never imagine myself eating the entire thing while dining there. After reading pro tips on Yelp, I ordered white rice on the side, which was a smart choice. I loved the crab meat the most in my combination pan roast. The shrimp were too small; lobster-- I don't know. i don't know why I didn't like them, but I've picked them out and gave it all to my husband. I did take my leftover as take out and had it later which was still good.   I timelapsed the entire cooking process that was in front of me. It honestly didn't seem like the chef was doing much. He was such an expert and I'm sure he does this hundreds of times in a day, so he just dropped off some ingredients. Then drop off some more. Stir it a little, and it was done! I saw the color or the sauce go from really light orange to light red, from their pan roasting procedure. I need one of those at home. Ok, maybe not. I also need their chef, and their secret ingredients & sauce. Then, maybe, I can handle their pan roast instrument at home. :)   I waited about an hour on a Tuesday 6pm. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely. Would I do it again? No doubt! Next time, I'm going to make sure I arrive starving so that I will eat even more, maybe 2 dozens of oysters. Service wasn't the best- don't take it personally if they're not nice to you. They're constantly busy with lines of people waiting all the time. They're working hard on meeting your needs.",

    "text": "FINALLY.  After all these years I finally ventured here to try their coveted Pan Roast.  We came here on a Friday night, after midnight (so I guess Saturday morning?)  There were around 13 people ahead in line already...which actually became about 18 because folks join in later.  So with that, the wait ended up being 2 hours.  We were seated around 2am.  I ordered the bouill-roast after reading some reviews.  It was stock full of seafood!  So much.  My husband and friend each got the combo pan roast.  Everything was freaking delicious. We had Ricardo on this night.  Dope dude.  Pats fan.  Since it was between 1am-9am, half a dozen oysters were $10 so I got that to share and it was fresh.    It was so good, my husband and I returned here on Sunday at 10:45am.  Once again, around 13-15 in line ahead which ended being closer to 20.  But we came right when a batch of diners were almost done so this time the wait was only...1hr45mins.  My husband and I both opted for the same dishes.  But this time we got it at a spicy level 7 (versus 6 my first time around).  Our chef was Bob (Patriots hater).  Not sure if it's just plain spicier or bob is more heavy handed but it certainly had a more major kick than the other night.  Nevertheless, still delicious.  The servers here are extremely nice and courteous and they work very hard to have parties seated together if possible. They manage to work a group of seven patrons after me!  Only six things can be cooked at the same time though, mind you so if you're in a big party, you won't be all fed the same time.  Now that we've finally dined here we know what all the fuss is about.  As my husband said when we left, \"I think this place just became a go-to spot for us.\"  He's right.",

    "text": "Ummm tbh, this seafood spot is a fun-ish to check out and try, but the quality of the seafood is meh (shrimp was overcooked in the stew and the oysters by the shell was pretty fishy).   Wait-time: Roughly 40mins on a Monday night around 7pm. Not bad, considering the wait times everyone else has been posting about, but was it worth it? Nah.   Line: a bit confusing bc there's some construction happening on the right hand side of their bar...so the line swings to the left now. Tons of ppl missed the line and tried to jump into open seats when they were walking by. Repeatedly. A bit awk once you're sat and the workers have to keep telling ppl to wait in the line.   Service: standard. Nothing specular or particularly bad.   Food: Shared a dozen raw oysters and another dozen raw clams. The mere size of the oysters were impressive, but had me a bit worried about how fishy they'd taste. And they were pretty fishy...   As for the clams, it was fresher, sweeter and had more of a bite to them than the oysters. My personal preference btw the two. And for the main, had the seafood stew. Flavors were on point, but seriously, all the seafood was over cooked!! Whyyy. Esp the shrimp. Pretty disappointing. Btw, this dish was massive. Everyone looked like they were ordering their own, but no one was finishing it. Totally shareable portions.   Overall, it was decent. I'm shocked that everyone has been giving such high reviews. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't come back. And I certainly wouldn't wait for it over an hour! 3 stars",

This place is fantastic and we hit it at I guess a great time because we didn't have a forever long wait, but as I was reading you will typically be on a wait here. The problem is there are only about twenty seats! Plus they didn't make people skinny up when they left spaces and weren't really in a hurry to seat people. That could have been more efficient. The casino had two large spaces that was empty. One was where a new restaurant is coming in and then the High Roller room had been cleared out. Why not make more cooking stations and add some additional seating?? I'm sure more people would come out to eat at the Oyster Bar and then stay to gamble if they weren't worried about an easy hour long wait. I would not wait that long, but only because there are so many great places in Vegas to eat, not because the food wasn't worth it. For our late night dinner had oysters, the caesar salad and the Combo Pan Roast that we easily shared. The oysters were not great and way too expensive for the quality. The salad was really good and HUGE! Then came the Pan Roast and it did not let down. I would totally order that again except that I want to try the Boulli-Roast next time! The seafood in it looked fantastic and oh DO NOT forget the hot sauce!! They call it Lava Sauce and we didn't learn about it until it was too late. It looked like something they made there and I would have bought a bottle of it if they had sold it!!",

From the morning we checked out, there was already a line forming so we thought we'd skip and wait until midnight-ish. After drinking and gambling, we come back at midnight to check on the line. HOLY POO! There's still a line forming. Whatever, I'll wait if it's this good. I think there was a line partly because there's only like 12 seats around the bar/kitchen. With 1 server and 1 cook. So picture it.   I think we waited for almost 1 1/2 hour until we finally got seated. For this wait, heck yeah we are gonna indulge ourselves! Given its name, \"Oyster Bar\" we just had to have oysters. And then their infamous Pan Roast. He also ordered the cioppino, too.   Oysters: Below average. Didn't seem fresh and very fishy taste. Good thing we only ordered half a dozen.   Pan Roast: Solid 4 stars. I've only had Pan Roast at another place back at the Anaheim Packing District and that was bomb. This one was excellent, too. But the overpowering sauce made it very hard to eat the whole thing. They give you one scoop of rice, but please do get more rice because you'll need it!   Cioppino: Average. Nothing really stood out. It was pretty spicy, so watch out you non-spicy eaters.   Both the Pan Roast and Cioppino came with lots of seafood. Worth your buck.   Cool concept and pretty nice experience as you get to sit and watch your food be prepared in front of you. Price is normal and not overpriced. Be patient because there WILL be a wait at anytime of the day.   Tip: Come here and just get the Pan Roast, skip everything else :)",

I got there at 7:10 on a Tuesday night and there was a line of 8 in front of me and I had to wait a hour roughly.  Thankfully, I was by myself so got to skip a few others when there was one seat open.   Food - I got the combo pan roast at level 5 spice.  I didn't taste the spiciness at all so I think people that regularly eat spicy stuff can go higher.  Food was amazing. I just wish I had more rice and bread to soak it up with...haha  Service - waitstaff was very friendly and have nothing but good things to say.",

We ordered the: Maryland Crab Cakes- basically, it was shredded cold crab meat on a bed of greens. No spices or seasonings. Definitely not what I expected nor worth the price.  Alaskan Chowder- absolutely delicious! Creamy, succulent, and spiced with the richest flavors a chowder deserves. The beautiful touch of a few mussels as a topping were aesthetically appealing as well in taste.   Pan Roast Combo- what most people recommend. Warning: when ordering, make sure you clearly specify \"COMBO.\" I ordered \"COMBO,\" but received a \"GUMBO.\" The chef quickly corrected the meal.  Overall, very delectable food and I am looking forward to many more nights at the Oyster Bar!",

We finally decided it was time for the first meal of the day before getting ready for the evenings festivities.   I had no idea what to expect, We parked in the parking lot which is huge, and easy to find close parking, and wandered inside the casino. Once we walked up, we saw the oyster bar sign, and it was only a bar with 18 seats? We looked to see if there was an additional restaurant.. Nope.. We debated for a moment if we wanted to stay, but the line was moving pretty quickly. I guess we came at a good time because the line was really long once we finished eating  I ordered a gumbo level 10 spicy, They had to ask me twice if that's what I wanted.1 being most mild and 10 being the spiciest. Yes it is, I am a fire eater. Extra fire please. It was also a fun experience because you can see the cooks making your food right behind the bar top.  The food arrived and it was DELICIOUS!!! Our group shared the clam chowder, and I started demolishing my gumbo , both portions were HUGEEEEEE. About half way through, I had to call it quits. I packed the rest to go, and I had 2 more mini meals.  I'm itching to come back to Vegas just for this gumbo!",

So ya this place is open 24/7 which means that you have plenty of time to go...... but it doesn't matter cos apparently there's a line 24/7 lol. I didn't have a choice but to wait, I mean.. I'm not a Vegas native, I live in Cali, I would probably only be in Vegas on the weekends.... so YA no matter how I do this, I would have to wait in line. So I did. For 3 hours... and more waiting for food after we ordered lol.  I went with my bf so he gambled a bit while I waited in line. He won like $550 sooooo I guess technically dinner was on the hotel! YAY!  We ordered a pan roast EACH, and I suppose due to our frustration from waiting, we just decided we should order a f*ckload because we're not gonna be doing this very often. So 2 pan roasts, 1 Alaskan chowder, and 1 gumbo. For 2 people. That's right.  So obviously I F**KING LOVED everything, or else I wouldn't have given it 5 stars. The pan roast was AMAZING. I ordered the combo (shrimp, crab, lobster) and an 8 on the spicy scale, which was deliciously spicy. I could've gone with a 9 or 10 probably and it would've been bomb also. It was perfect with the rice. Damn, it was seriously so good........... I dunno how else to explain. Now I get why people wait so damn long for this.  The Alaskan chowder...... wow. No lie, it was probably the best chowder I've had lol. It's filled with not just clams, but SHRIMP, LOBSTER, and CRAB?! I mean come on, give the other chowders a chance! But no seriously, it will blow them all out of the water (pun alert). So tasty and seriously loaded with seafood.   The gumbo was also ridiculously tasty. I personally LOVE gumbo, and this one might just be my new favorite. We ordered a 5 on the spicy scale so it wasn't as spicy as I'd like, but sooooooooo goood. You definitely need that rice with it also, cos it can get VERY... flavorful? lol. It's also filled with so much seafood - lobster, crab, etc. and sausages!  The best part about these dishes is they don't skimp on the seafood. I was a little overwhelmed by how many FAT lobster pieces I found! Totally worth what they're charging.  So obviously we had plenty of leftovers, and I was eating them for like... the next 4 days I think LOL. And dude, they were STILL extremely tasty. I thought I would be sick of it but I was truly sad when I had no more left.......... :(",

    "text": "2 words - Pan Roast - best thing on the menu - definitely get this. I got the combo which came with a good amount of shrimp but lacked on crab meat. I'd probably go with the lobster or crab pan roast if you're not big on shrimp.   Spice level 5 was perfect for me - hot enough to enjoy but not be painful. I'm the type that puts sriracha on everything. The sauce is delicious - creamy, buttery, sweet, tangy, spicy tomato stew with shrimp and shredded crab is the best I can describe it.   The bf got the bouillabaisse which was ok in my opinion. Came with more seafood than the pan roast but not all of it was good or fresh. The clams/ mussels were not that fresh. The lobster/crab were ok. The shrimp was ok - they used a larger shrimp than the pan roast for the bouillabaisse. The soup base was thinner, more seafood flavor, and herbs - thyme/ rosemary?? Similar to the herbs used in chicken soup. It was also a bit saltier. Mixing it with the pan roast was very good though I probably wouldn't get the bouillabaisse next time.   I came here on a Tuesday around lunch time 12:15 - waited about 45 mins to get seated and maybe another 25-30 for the food. There's only maybe 15 seats at the bar so prepare for a wait. Also it's open 24 hours so come at an odd hour - probably less of a wait.   You must have your ID - there's beer at the bar so they require you have ID to sit at the bar - saw a guy wait for a table only to get rejected cause he didn't have his ID on him. Getting out to Station casino is a bit of a trek if you're further south on the strip but I'd say it's worth it for the pan roast.",

Hopefully you're lucky and find a time that isn't so busy but I always seem to arrive when there's an 1+ hour line.   But otherwise, the food, service, and did I mention food? are so freaking good that it's worth it. If you are just visiting Vegas like most people, then you should devote some time to come try this place out. Pan roast is absolutely amazing here and will create a new craving you never knew you had.

We had the classic pan roast (again) which comes with chunks of lobster, several shrimps, and crab.  The spiciness level is made to order....anything over six is tough for us.  Try the level four.  We do wish, however, that there were more pots and seats to reduce the wait.  Once company in Southern California actually learned the cooking process from the owner of the Oyster Bar.

Expect a wait no matter what time you're going just from the sheer popularity of this place. The Oyster Bar is an 18-19 seat bar with one man doing all the cooking and one waitress taking orders and taking care of drinks.   We came at around 1:45pm on a Friday and waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. Then it was another 20 min wait for our food. Under normal circumstances we would not have been happy waiting that long for food but watching the people around us eating really made us more willing to sit patiently. We ordered the Alaskan Chowder and Combo Pan Roast (shrimp, crab, and lobster), which came out to be about $50 with tax and tip. I was also eyeing their amazing looking oysters too. The man shucks them right in front of you and they looked absolutely fresh, plump, and creamy... what a dream! I regretted not ordering them but our chowder and pan roast was more than enough. We had to take 1/3 of our orders home because the portions were just too large! The textures were on point and the amount of seafood was plentiful and more than generous. I've already reheated the pan roast for dinner and it still tasted amazing. I can't wait to eat my leftover Alaskan Chowder tomorrow. Next time, I'm ordering their oysters!",

I've waited in this line because I've heard way too many good things about it.   This place is a SMALL oysters bar. The bar probably can seat 20-25 people. When we got here the line was long and i mean LONG with annoying drunk people waiting in line with us. We got here about 11:30 pm and were not seated until 1:30 pm.   There is nothing negative i can say about this place but BRAVO! We've ordered a dozen of these large Luisiana oysters and a seafood gumbo. I wasn't a big fan of he oysters, WHY? They tasted dirty = sand or just lake water. Don't get me wrong their oysters were decent but i had cleaner and better oysters. Now this gumbo was to die for! It was prepared to perfection and had just the right amount of spice for a good kick. I don't really drool over restaurants but this place was fantastic. They had several other menu items that looked and smelled fantastic and I will definitely try them next time i make to vegas.  Yes, the lines are long but it's definitely worth the wait. The cook Derick was in good spirits and even though i annoyed the hell out of him, he still kept positive and didn't tell me to go F*** myself. Those guys at this bar are amazing and if i could give them a 10 start i totally would.   Thank you!",

    "text": "Erm, this place is amazing! I had been wanting to try it out for a few months and finally got the chance to last Thursday with my friend. I could see how this place could get super busy because we arrived at around 6 p.m. and there was a line of about 10 people(which we were actually REALLY stoked about because it seemed relatively short compared to what line hell I`ve read about here on Yelp). Anyway, we did wait about 45 minutes and looked on in a semi hangry daze as people took their sweet, sweet time even after they were done eating(please don`t be these people). I did talk to the guy in front of me in line and he raved about their pan roasts and gumbo, so this solidified my commitment to steel myself and wait it out like an adult instead of bailing and eating something less satisfactory.   When we were finally seated, our order was taken right away(Combo pan roast, oysters, beer. Please)and they brought us a little loaf of sourdough bread with butter. You would have thought we hadn't eaten in days by the way we tore into our bread, but seriously the smells at that counter are ridiculous and can make one lose their damn mind. We chatted, drank, and ate bread(I even ate just butter at one point because I was really hungry. Don`t judge me). We were brought our oysters about 15 minutes after sitting down and we dug in. Here is the thing: I do not enjoy offensively large oysters, so I wasn't thrilled. There were some medium ones that I enjoyed, but overall, I wasn't impressed. There was also a lack of that salt water goodness on the half shells, so I would pass on the oysters themselves. Just my personal opinion. About 15 minutes after that our food came. The contents of the bowl was plenty and HOT(Be careful. Don`t be like me and burn yourself). After some cooling down, I dug in and it was heaven. Spicy, creamy, seafoody, savory. It was an experience. There is a big lump of rice right in the center of the bowl and this really made the dish that much more. You need that rice to sop up the spicy saucy sexiness of that pan roast.   It was a lot of food for me and my friend helped me out and he agreed it was amazing. My last gripe is that my beer was finished and I wasn't asked if I wanted another for a little while. I get it, it's busy, but pay attention to me! Anyway, I got my beer and I actually took it with me as to give others a chance to sit down after I was done eating(You should be like me and be considerate).  I would come back just for that pan roast and I would wait longer than I did to get it again. I do want to try their gumbo and jambalaya as well. I need another oyster bar food baby soon. Any takers?  Definitely a must if you're in Las Vegas.",

We ended up ordering 3 soups because after the wait I've decided never to come back. The Alaskan clam chowder was excellent. The pan roast was intriguing a little sweet but good. The ettouffee was not as similar to the pan roast as another Yelper claimed. It has its own distinctive taste but came a distant 3rd among the three soups.    We went on a Friday evening thinking lines will be shorter since most people wouldn't waste their weekend standing in line. WRONG!!! 2 1/2 hours. If not for the wait I would've given this place 5 stars. Their waiting system need a major revamp. Maybe a texting system or little vibrating beepers. But the wait is not acceptable. The tasty soups is now worth the wait.",

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar!   Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!  We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin!   We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO!   I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!  Happy Eats!",

    "text": "i've tried the imitators in southern california --- ritter's steam kettle cooking, kettlebar. I like both, but I was excited to try the OG pan roast, the place it all began. our group of 4 woke up and got in line at ~10am on a saturday morning. there was only one couple ahead of us! we waited about 20-30mins for 4 seats together.   i had the palace pan roast (23.99) which comes with crab, shrimp, sausage, and chicken. we also shared a dozen oysters. the chef wasn't sure what kind of oysters they were, but they were huuuuuge and super fresh. however, not too much flavor or creaminess, which i prefer on my oysters (think kusshi, kumamotos). but the PAN ROAST. wow. where do i even start? SO much flavor!! I don't even know how to begin describing it. buttery, creamy, rich, packs a punch of flavor with all the different spices, and flavored with bits and chunks of the crab floating through the bowl. a good amount of shrimp cooked to perfection and coated in the sauce, lots of andouille sausage slices, tender chicken chunks... we got a 7 in terms of spiciness and it was perfect --- some heat, but still enjoyable to eat.   they also gave bread and butter, but i skipped this because i was filling up on that delicious pan roast and fluffy white rice. we all had leftovers, and they pack it for you very well. on the drive back home, i actually ate the pan roast cold and it was still amazing. a little salty without the rice, but i couldn't stop eating it anyway.   this place is open 24hrs so find some time in your day to stop by and try the pan roast. easily on my top 3 favorite eats in vegas.",

Definitely order the Combo Pan Roast and the Alaskan Clam Chowder, those alone make it SO WORTH THE WAIT!  Ironically, the oysters were okay, not succulent and somewhat chewy, but the other dishes definitely compensated our trip there.    Would we do it again?  Probably...but if we see that long line, we may have to reconsider LOL",

I immediately looked it up and Yelp to see what all the fuss was about and honestly. The everyone's complaint was wait time but WORTH IT.  I knew from that moment that I was ready for a 5 hour wait.   Then 30 minutes into it I felt like passing out. BUT I didn't. I waited. FOREVER.  I've gone four times far and I've tried: *Oysters on a half shell (turtle power!) *Clam chowder (cup and bowl - bowl is too big UNLESS you are sharing) *Combo Pan Roasttttttttah is the bessstttaaahh  The oysters looked like they were on steroids. Maybe I just get small oysters on the reg but damn. These oysters are SO GOOD. Even the complimentary bread is good. Probably because you're starving, about to pass out from starvation by waiting in a line for hours with random strangers you make friends with because in that time, you become best friends and had mutual looks of extreme food satisfaction by silent nods with your eyes closed while you eat because you're FINALLY EATING AMAZING FOOD.

I tend to ask for extra bread as I like eating the bread with the pan roast, but they also give you rice. I would recommend to ask for the rice on the side. The price is also reasonable since seafood tends to be more on the higher end, but I can guarantee you that you can't go wrong with this place.

It is a tiny food bar with only 18 seats and Palace Station has a place to queue up as they know people will wait.  The Gumbo was as close as you can get outside of Nawlins.  The Roast Pot is probably the most delicious on the menu.  We also had the Gold Band oysters that were as good as my favorite Blue Points.  This place is worth the wait.  You can minimize the wait by not going during peak hours of lunch and dinner.",

    "text": "This is my 2nd time eating here and both times the wait was very long, over an hour. The set up is 1 U-shaped bar and 1 chef with assistants next to him working the line. However, the line is that long and people still wait in it for a good reason. This hidden gem is no longer that hidden and is also open 24 hours. They start your off with a roll and butter to hold you over after such a wait. What we usually order between my fiance and I are dozen raw oysters on half shell and a pan roast to share. The oysters are fresh but I have to admit there's tendency for a little more oyster \"mud\" than I typically expect, nevertheless still good. About $17 for a dozen. The pan roast tops off the meal, this is the limiting factor to the pace of this meal. There are pots that cook the pan roast orders in front of the patrons at the bar and they are cooked in order of how you were in line, so sometimes if you finally were able to sit, you may have to wait a bit longer if you didn't make it onto this current batch of pan roasts. We've tried the combo pan roast and the palace pan roast, the main difference is combo has lobster and palace has chicken and sausage. The palace is 22.99 and combo is 19.99. I personally like the palace better since it is more filling with the chicken, the crab and lobster kind of just disappear into the sauce. The menu says there is a $5 fee for sharing, but they didn't charge us even though they gave us each a bowl of rice, which is pretty cool of them (extra tip!). If you like spicy sauce with your rice, dont be scared to ask for more spice. We ordered 7 out of 10 and it was still not very spicy. Good satisfying meal! Next time I gotta try the clams on half shell.",

    "text": "To all my friends and Las vegas go-ers, i cannot tell you how much love i have for this place.  Food: The food itself is phenomenal. it's a creole type like place and according to my friends (because i don't eat oysters) the oysters were really good. My favorite would have to be the combo pan roast with sausage. But the bouillabaise and Gumbo is just as amazing if you want to try anything different. I always get spicy level 6 it's the perfect spice level if you can handle spicy like i can. While you wait for you food I suggest either getting some oysters or if you're like me get a cup of the chowder. it doesn't matter if you get the new england or manhattan. They're both really good either way. Ask for extra rolls if you need any.  Pricing: If you're a first time go-er you would think it's really expensive. it's almost $20 for every entree, but the amount of food they give you can feed two people. I usually just share mine and I still always have left overs. There is a $5 split fee, but trust it's not all that bad. Oysters are 11.99 for half a dozen and 16.99 for a dozen.   Customer service: This place is always busy and there's only like a total of 2 people working, the chef and the server. Somehow they manage to always keep their energy high and they love to joke a lot. I've been here about 6 times already and everytime i go, I've always enjoyed it. Customer service can be a bit slow, but you gotta give them a break. I do warn you the seating for this place is very limited. i would say the bar only seat 14 and unfortunately it's only for 21+. I got carded like 3 times already. i would recommend coming here either early in the morning or late at night. that way you avoid the lines.",

    "text": "Ahh! Such a disappointment. I know I still gave it 3 stars, but for the long wait it should really be even less.   We got a dozen oysters, the clam chowder that everyone raves about and the combination pan roast.   The dozen oysters were fresh and decent sized. It came with a side of horseradish and lemon. There were also plenty of hot sauces around to try. Overall, good.   The clam chowder was the biggest bust of them all. It's good clam chowder I'll give you that. There are plenty of good pieces of clams in it. But come on... Best ever? I think not. It's ordinary.  The combination pan roast was a good spicy Cajun type dish. It had a good amount of seafood (although looking around, other people with the same dish had more so maybe we were just getting punked). We ordered an 8 level of spicy and some how it was like a 10. We tried our friend 10 and ours was even spicier than his. Not even enjoyable to eat. Few bites in and we were done with it.   The place is super small and severely understaffed. There is one chef cooking at 6 steam kettles and also shucking all the oysters. There is one or two waitresses at a time and they do everything!! Taking orders, serving alcohol, bussing tables, bringing checks, packing take out, etc. yeah it's typical stuff but they were really working super hard. No wonder the wait takes sooooo long. I don't blame then but there has gotta be a faster way of doing things.  Overall, the food was decent but I really wouldn't wait that long again. It's just not that exciting to me to waste a day in Vegas over this.",

You know how most restaurants, when you order something on the menu, the food ends up being either a hit or miss?  Not Palace Station's \"Oyster Bar\".  Everything on their menu, everything on their chalkboard's Specials, every single item is a HIT.  Everything tastes so good here.  We came here initially to order the Pan Roast dish, but I wanted to gamble a bit with the Jambalaya special, and hot damn it was excellent!  The consistency of the rice - seafood ratio was perfect in every bite.  Not too wet, and not too dry, every bite was perfect.  I polished the plate with my tongue, the chef loved the way I killed it.  Pan roast is very good too, but has a curry texture to it, so if you want more of a soupy dish, Pan Roast is the way to go, if you want a guaranteed hit, go for the Jambalaya.",

The area is sketchy to say the least but after tons and tons of suggestions we had to try Oyster bar.   Luckily there was no wait and we were seated instantly. We started with a round of Kirin followed by a dozen oysters and clams. I must admit I'm a sucker for oysters on the half shell, but these oysters left something to be desired. The oysters were not shucked properly making them difficult to eat. I was starting to get disappointed until the Pan Roast combo came out. That thing was HUGE and delicious, packed with shrimp, crab and lobster with a side of steam rice.   Over all the Pan Roast was finger licking good with just enough spice to accent the seafood. Even though the area was totally sketchy and the hotel is less than nice this Oyster Bar is a diamond in the rough and a must try in Vegas.  P.s. If you're coming from the strip its a $25-35 cab ride, depending on traffic",

You really can't go wrong with the Pan Roast as a dish for a first timer.  Personally, the spicier the better so I went with a 6 for my first time but cursed myself because I felt I could go up a point or two higher!  Luckily you have a good choice of hot sauces to add if you want that little extra kick.  As for the serving, they are generous, I probably shouldn't be eating so much, especially with all those rolls I used to suck up any errant soup.  Also while I'm at it, I should mention it was my first time trying oysters too.  And while I didn't find them disgusting, it's definitely not something I see myself eating much with or without cocktail sauce and horseradish.    If there's one thing I can knock the place for is how it literally is just a bar, with just one cook and one waitress and with its obvious popularity it takes to awhile to get seated or get serviced at high traffic times like Saturday night but at least when you do the staff is friendly and even goes above the call of duty.  So in short, I'll definitely make a trip back.  The Palace Pan Roast and the pastas all looked delicious!",

I know some people like to eat on the strip but trust me that this place is worth it, even if you got to pay for a cab.  It is literally a bar that sits inside the casino, along a wall.  You sit at the counter on a bar stool.  By the way, there is only about 20 bar stools, yes I said a total of 20.  There is a roped area where you wait in line for a seat.  I tried it on a Friday night at about 9-10 pm.  I was eating with one friend (party of two) and we waited in line for about 30-45 minutes.  From what I understand, this is pretty typical.  This place can get busy, for good reason.  There is nowhere to sit when you are waiting in line, you are pretty much just standing there.  If you are with a group, you could have one person stand in line while others sit at nearby slot machines.  I mention this because I saw a couple people do it.  I ordered the Combo Pan Roast.  It is kinda like a seafoood bisque containing lobster, crab, and shrimp.  It was excellent.  The portion size was more than enough.  The pan roast cost me about 20 bucks.  I had it with ice water and the complimentary bread.  My friend ordered the Combo Gumbo.  It was also good but I preferred the Pan Roast.  I saw some people ordering the Clam Chowder and Ciopinno too.  They cook each order right in front of you, individually.  The cooking equipment they used was unique and was fun to watch.  Service was great.  I will definitely come here again when I visit Las Vegas.  They have recently changed their hours so they are open 24 hours.",

A skinnier gentleman wearing a blue long-sleeved button-down with \"Steven\" on his name tag served us. He was the only one serving and bussing this 12-14 seat bar. We waited for ten minutes before getting our seats. They have a late-night special menu, which included dollar Budlights, Linguini & Clams for $7.99, and Bloody Mary for $3.50. I ordered a Pepsi. My love ordered a Bud Light.  We took advantage of the special menu and ordered the Linguini with Clams, and we ordered \"Chowda,\" New England Clam Chowder, which is our favorite item from the oyster bar . We shared our food, but Evan, the cook, said, \"Don't tell Steve you're sharing! Otherwise, it's five dollars to split your plate.\" He said it nonchalantly and added, \"You're just swapping, right?\" \"Right,\" we answered.   To the food:  Linguini and Clams: Linguini was al dente, and there were a boatload of clams in the linguini. It wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't bad either. It was good.  \"Chowda:\" This is the reason why we come. The chowder is served in two sizes, cup for $4.99 and bowl for $6.99. The bowl was like a super bowl. It's very filling and definitely should be \"swapped\" with your friends. There're a lot of oysters in the clam chowder. The soup is creamy, not watery and not too thick. If you want another place to go for this awesome clam chowder, you can also go to Texas Station on Fridays for their buffet, as they have clam chowder there as soup of the day.   Great clam chowder in Greater Las Vegas... a great late night special/late night happy hour place to go to.  YUM!",

    "text": "When people tell you that a restaurant is more than about food and that it's also about experience...well let me tell you there's a lot of truth to that. The service is good, the chefs are funny, and the food isn't bad. The Oyster Bar is good, but I really can't see myself going back or consistently placing it in the top five of Yelp due to a couple things out of their control.  The food was good. I had the clam chowder, combo pan roast, and seafood jambalaya. The server told me I was able to get a 2nd entree because there was no line at the moment. So I guess yay for my inner fat kid. The clam chowder was good, the oven pan roast was also good. A lot creamier than I had expected, almost like a tomato cream based tom kha gai from a Thai restaurant. The jambalaya was actually really good, some people at the bar were complaining that the gumbo was too salty so I went with this instead and it had a nice level of spice, not salty, and good meat. Honestly, it was good and I enjoyed it but I don't think I would ever be out with a group of friends and think \"Hey let's go to the Oyster Bar.\" But it's still worth a decent amount of stars.  Where it loses stars is its size as noted from prior posts. It seats 16, has only 6 of those seafood pots and these dishes take some time to make. The server said I was lucky and got there with no line and that it's an average of 45 - 90 minute wait. A wait isn't a big deal if the food is worth it, but the food isn't so knock your socks off amazing that you can't find something comparable if not better within a 10 mile radius of Palace Station.   For the time I was there (during the day), I saw a guy box out [basketball term not boxing punch] a random woman who almost fell to the floor for one seat, a random guy mouthing off to the chef for no reason and should've gotten hot soup thrown on him, a grandma almost bitch slap this meth head for grabbing her bread, and a drunk with a sweet ass Stardust shirt fall asleep face first into his clam chowder....I almost needed the Heimlich because I was trying not to laugh so hard I almost choked. Serves me right I guess. Then the lady next to me, turned to me and said \"this is nothing wait until dinner time it gets worse, there are actually yelling matches and fights out here.\" Now maybe she could've been exaggerating but it already just seemed like too much weirdness. All in all it was still good though. If I happened to be at the Palace Station I'd eat there again but I don't think I'd put in the effort to come back...food wise...people watching wise I'm all in!",

What I got was pretty good (it was the house \"gumbo\") it has shrimp,crab and lobster. You have an option of how spicy you'd like it; scale 1-10. But it had a creamy sauce think vodka pasta sauce. The portion size it LARGE two people could share it. I ate what I could and packe it to go. Only to leave it at the bus stop ( I got tired of carrying it around), hoping someone less fortunate would come along and eat it! Needless to say, later that night I wished I'd held on to it.   I'm definitely going back, gonna try the mussles, oysters on a hlaf shell and the bloody mary oyster shots!",

After walking 5 mins through the Palace Station Casino.  You will find yourself @ the Oyster Bar and most likely a long line. **20-40min wait**  The Oyster bar seats about 18-20 ppl.  While waiting in line, I was told by my co-workers and people in line that the Palace Pan Roast and the fresh raw oyster were A-Must try.     The Palace Pan Roast is a big bowl of delicious creole broiled goodness; it  comes with shrimp, crab meat, and sausages mixed together in a tasty stock of creamy, tomato stew.  They will ask you how spicy you what your pan roast, I got something between mild and spicy, which was just the right for me.  You have the options of a scoop of rice or pasta to go along with your yummy Pan Roast.  All this is cooked live in front of you with stream powered pots.  My co-workers ordered 2 dozen of the raw oysters, but I wasn't in the mood for raw oysters that night.   They looked delicious, and fresh enough for me to have some, when I return to Vegas this summer.  They were HUGE too!  Oyster Bar has made it on my list of places to stop by everytime I am in Vegas now.",

Came here for a late dinner, and the line was crazy long. I think my girlfriend and I ended up waiting in line well over an hour. Each of the previous times I've come to Oyster Bar, it's usually been in the morning or early lunchtime. The trick is to avoid the crowds, as I finally was introduced to the long wait that my cousin had long warned me about.  I ordered the Alaskan Chowder, New England style with an added side of pasta. I loved the idea of having a variety of seafood items in addition to the typical clams, but just found that the thick consistency with that large portion size to just be too much for me to handle. Maybe that's a quality that you like, but I'll order something else next time.  To review: plan coming here early, and don't order the chowder (unless you want to share).",

    "text": "Living and visiting Las Vegas I try to stop by The Oyster Bar at Palace Station Casino to get some of that delicious Pan Roast or Seafood Gumbo. I try to explain to people what the food is like and until you actually go and taste it you really can't get the goodness in words.  Here is a photo from last time I was there: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fjeremyandrews%2F4826303270%2Fin%2Fset-72157624570150854%2F&s=c4d10aa6b9cbb6b970813bc9f0ada76644daf640ecd9e0d41983a9bd0e3df871\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flickr.com/photos/jeremy...</a>  This place is often imitated in Las Vegas, and I have tried some of the imitators and they can't get the flavor and experience down right. The Oyster Bar is not a high-end looking place or a restaurant per se, more of a cut out in the wall right off the casino. I like that it is in Palace Station, because if it was in a high traffic casino on the strip the line would be way too long. Plus, it is good to enjoy the old school casinos and take a break from the fake, and expensive ones on the strip (may just be me from living there so long).  If you go around lunch or dinner expect a wait because there is only like 20 seats which are high chairs around the Oyster Bar. You sit right next to other people, which is good for striking up conversation and talking about the good food you are eating. The cooks prepare everything right in front of you which is fun to watch and gets your appetite going.  My favorite thing to order is the Combo Lobster and Oyster Pan Roast which is served in a sweet and spicy tomato bisque sauce. I usually substitute the scoop of rice that is served with it and get linguine pasta instead. The highlight is the sauce and how they cook it in those steam pots, so if Lobster and Oysters are not your thing, add something else like shrimp or something, whatever you get, the tomato bisque will be GOOD! My second favorite dish there is the Seafood Gumbo which is served with a scoop of white rice, so many good flavors and tastes going on.  These are good sized portions so be prepared for a doggy bag. On the other hand, if you came to eat, enjoy some appetizers like Oysters on the shell (be sure to view a few before ordering, it's Vegas after all, and note the season you are in), shrimp cocktails, and I usually go for the Caesar Salad (nothing special, but tasty). There is also deserts available. Soft Drinks, Draft & Bottled Beer, and Wine too.  I seriously dream about this food from the Oyster Bar when I am not in Las Vegas, enjoy!  Oh, and they will ask you if you want 1-5 spicy for heat, instead I suggest getting a little heat like 1 or 2 and later just add hot sauce to taste which are available on the bar in front of you. Nothing like having a big bowl of great food but not a good idea to get 5 stars of heat and unbearable to eat.",

No wait at 2am. My bf really enjoyed the warm sourdough rolls they gave us. We shared a bowl of CLAM CHOWDER and a CRAB AND LOBSTER PAN ROAST. They both are SOOOO GOOOOD. :)))))  Bf said this was the best clam chowder he's ever had. I thought it was aite...if it had a little less salt, maybe. It's a pretty big bowl of soup, because we could barely finish the pan roast. Seriously, the two of us, hungry and tired heavy weight eaters could not finish?  There's a bit of a wait since they make the pan roast right there in front of you. I didn't want shrimp in ours so the lady nicely replaced it with extra crab. Heh too bad it wasn't extra lobster - the lobster is YUUUMMMAY! Nice big chunks. A bowl of pan roast has SOOO much meat in it. The base was extremely creamy and tomato-y. At spicy level 2, it felt like a giant fancy bowl of tomato soup! I love tomato soup. I guess our server knew we were sharing the pan roast so she gave us two scoops of rice on two separate plate before I even asked =)  We finished less than half the pan roast and took the rest to go. Since it was day 1 of our 3 day trip to Vegas, I was afraid it would spoil. But my bf loved it so much that he insisted we bring it home to LA. THAT is how good Oyster Bar's pan roast tastes.  UPDATE: Try your very best to avoid dinner hours. The wait is dreadful, especially for a party of 4. There are only so many seats at the bar.",

It offers friendliness beautiful rooms courteous people slots that pay out restaurants that are available 24 hours a day.  The Oyster Bar open 24 hours a day , probably fits 12 people friendly personal service, food cooked in front of you wonderful chowder fresh fish. We wouldn't stay anywhere else",

    "text": "Palace Station (one of many station casinos in las vegas) is located on Sahara. Each station casino has some type of \"oyster bar\", but they all suck in comparison to The Oyster Bar.  Further more, the only reason you should be at the Palace Station is to wait in line and eat at the Oyster Bar.  First off, they have 6 broilers and about 14 bar stools. So do the math. They can cook 6 orders at a time and only seat just twice that. So when you are waiting, you'll be waiting, so just wait.  No price change for lunch or dinner, and it's a large portion, so we go for dinner. Now about Palace Station. It's an old, smokey, depressing piece of crap place, you will leave smelling like you gave up on life. But you won't care because the meal at The Oyster Bar was that good.  We get the \"Combo Roast\". A mix of crab/lobster/shrimp in a tomato cream \"bisque\" type sauce. Sounds simple, it is, but it's delicious.  They also do gumbo, bouillabaisse and fresh oysters (among many other things). A few oysters or some chowder to start off might be good if you're hungry as it does take a bit for your food to be cooked.  I'd be confident everything on the menu is great.",

Food wise, everything is delicious from the roasts, to the oysters, and to the chowders. I highly recommend the combo roast and the dirty chowder, which is half Manhattan clam chowder and half new england clam chowder. I had my doubts at first bit it turned out to be actually quite good.   As seating is limited, wait times can get quite long during regular meal time. I recommend going at off hours like three am after a night out.",

We waited 1.5 hours to be seated (there were just two of us). I would not recommend going to Oyster Bar with more than 3 people because the seating is very limited.

    "text": "This place is great. If you like seafood, Either shellfish or fish itself, your in for a treat. Stations Casinos have a few of these places, 2 others that I've seen, 1 at Palace Station, the other being at Green Valley Ranch, I have never eaten at any of them, but a friend of mine had eaten at the Palace station place, and raved about it. So we figured why not try this one out at Sunset. Great choice!!!! The menu isn't overly big, but I still had a hard time figuring out what to order because everything looked great, either on the menu, or being cooked and served next to us.  After going back and forth, we both decided on the Seafood Gumbo. It can be ordered 4 different was, choices are Shrimp, Lobster, Oyster, or everything. I might be off on the options, but it's very close to that. Anyway, it was great, at least 8-10 large shrimp, nice lobster chunks, and plenty of chicken and sausage. The serving size is big. Just think of a cereal bowl and multiply it by 4, that's the serving size. Now, I'm a big man, and can eat, but it couldn't finish my serving. I tried, very hard, but could only get down about 65%. The rest was take home for my dinner. As far as cost, very reasonable for what your getting, any seafood out here is way overpriced, but I also come from the east coast, and I grew up paying $3-$5 per lobster, not by the pound. So my opinion on pricing is a little off, but as far as this place goes, there cheap com paired to other casino places I've been to here.   Service was great, food was great,,and prices were great, can't ask for anything more!!! A couple other things I wanted to mention, I noticed that everything I saw was FRESH!!! No odd smells, or dirty areas, everything is fresh and clean. I forgot to say everything is cooked right at the bar, so you can see everything being used and cooked in front of you, unless your sitting at one of the lower tables.   Another point is I noticed lots of locals coming in and ordering stuff to go. That speaks volumes here in Vegas. For a few reasons, one being, most people aren't going to a casino just to get Clam Chowder to go. I counted 5 different locals coming in and doing that. You can get that same item probably at 15 different places on the way to the casino!!!! Much easier, and in much less time. That is enough for me to want to do the same next time I want there food. It's a real pain in the rear parking your vehicle, walking a half a mile to the Bar, and then repeating the trip back out. So, if people are doing that, than it must be good.   That's it for me, check this place out, if you like this type of food, your going to really like this place. Enjoy.",

We finally had the time to wait (note, be prepared to wait a very long time) and finally got to sit on the booth.  The smell and aroma of the food alone was worth standing there like an idiot and looking at other patrons who had already got their food.  I ordered the lobster pan roast (what I thought was lobster bisque), Oyster shooters (with tequila), ceasar salad, and a nice cold beer to go with it.  They give you sour dough rolls to munch on while they prepare the food.  The ceasar salad was a pretty huge portion, I had to share with a friend because I couldn't finish it.  And the shooters were pretty good, my friends didn't care for it... but the Lobster pan roast? One word: AMAZING.  The servers and cook was pretty cool to talk with also.  I've also found out that while they shuck the oysters and clams, they smell then to make sure they are fresh before serving.  Anything that smells funky, they will toss as they don't  want to serve bad food.  I'd recommend this place!",

I forgot where the origin is from. It tasted alright. It was juicy but didn't taste as good as what I had from Seafood and Company and Neptune Oysters in Boston. It had a clean taste. I was expecting a lot since this place is an osyter bar and had a lot of good reviews. However,  I highly recommend the New England calm chowder. Very tasty and don't forget to add the tobacco sauce to the soup. This place is opened 24/7. The only drawback is that is has limited seating and it is bar style seating arrangements so it may take awhile to get seated.",

Steven is the counter guy, and Ricardo is the cook (a machine, actually) who are talkative and entertaining guys.    The chowder is awesome, the bouillabaisse is fantastic, but the Pan Roast is my personal favorite (kinda a bisque-like soup jam-packed with crab, lobster, shrimp, chicken & andouille sausage).

It appears that the greedy owners will only hire two people to work this entire operation. Over all rating is poor based on inability to serve the customers in a timely manner. Waiting in line for two hours is not something the average person should have to do.  The employees try very hard, they work very hard but they can not keep up with demand which is clearly the fault of management, greedy owners rule.",

A bunch of us ordered different things but i stuck to their famous pan roast dish which comes with white rice. It's so creamy and full of flavor. It's a must try and easily one of the best things i've ever eaten in my life :) The rest of the group seem to enjoy their other dishes as well (jambalya, gumbo, oysters).

We enjoyed a couple dozen Oysters and a few shooters before digging into a couple of Pan Roasts. We got two between the four of us and with the oysters we had already eaten it was plenty of food and worth the $5 shared plate fee. Note to self.... next time save the bread they give you in the beginning to dip in the sauce! We enjoyed chatting with the chefs who cook in those amazing kettles.. even the guy shucking oysters went to culinary school! If there is a next time for me I'll be ordering the shrimp scampi. Every time they cooked up a batch the smell of sauteed garlic made my mouth water. All around great place. They're open 24/7 so I'd be curious to see what kind of crowds they have eating raw oysters for breakfast :)",

There is only seating for 18 (when you're in line so long, you count chairs and weigh who will leave next and curse those who order more). The staff is INCREDIBLE. There's a long wait, but it's not their fault. They're always happy and friendly. We celebrated my mom's 60th birthday and they brought her some cheesecake and the whole place was singing along.   Place is open 24 hours and when the wait is long, I recommend one person waits in line while the other(s) grab a quick snack at the Cabo Bar so you don't starve to death.

So here's what we ordered:   Half a dozen of oysters (fresh, juicy, and plump)  Combo pan roast (level 2) (switched rice to pasta) Alaskan Clam Chowder  Both of our dishes were full of chunks of seafood!

Also, every bite of the clam chowder was shredded clam or big bits of shrimp and other seafood.   Overall, the service was great and friendly. Steve and the chef were awesome! The limited space with the wait is discouraging, but don't lose hope! I'm coming for the food and I will be returning!",

I wanted to try something else other than pan roast. My wife was gonna order the pan roast we I could always steal some of hers.  I remember the first time we went, I couldn't eat as much pan roast as I wanted. The creaminess of the pan roast, didn't sit well with me. So I tried the bouillabaisse, read a couple comments.   I found what I was looking for. I'll add more spice next time. And maybe switch the rice for noodles. But the stew was perfect for me. I finished all the seafood, I was stuffed and happy. Thank you!",

    "text": "I came. I saw. I conquered. I know I'm a late bloomer, but for some reason I kept hearing about their pan roast! So I had to see what the deal was. Located inside the Palace Station, this Oyster Bar seats only 20 people I think. With raving reviews, you would have to come prepared to wait an hour or so. Don't come starving, because you'll be waiting a while. Trust me. It is well worth the wait.  We got the infamous PAN ROAST and we tried to change it up to try multiple dishes and also got the ETOUFFEE. Pan Roast. It's all about the Pan Roast. The chef described it on the dot. It is like a lobster bisque with shrimp, crab, and lobster. They also add some rice with it as well. Mhm, and I love me some lobster bisque. You can also choose your level of spice in both dishes which ranges from 1 to 10. 6 is pretty on the dot if you want a nice kick, but not too spicy.   The etouffee was delicious as well, in which I also highly recommend if you don't want the pan roast. However, it's just not strong enough to outshine that pan roast. The etouffee also had the shrimp, crap, and lobster.  Pan Roast was $19.99 and Etouffee $17.99.  I commend the chef for all his hard work, cooking all those dishes at once, non stop, and still able to keep the quality of the dishes top notch. He's truly a master of his craft. I definitely recommend this to be a place to try at least once, but even just talking about it now makes me crave for some pan roast!",

I HAVE missed a flight just so I could eat a bowl here. True story, just that darn good! No regrets!  Everything is great. My fav are the Palace and Combo Pan Roasts. Oysters are good but a pan roast is more than enough food already. I only order Oysters in groups so we can share. A pan roast is huge and can easily be shared.  Definite stop in Vegas!!!",

I ordered boulibase and took 20 minutes to cook. They are not stingy with the seafood as we got a lot of crab, fish, scallops, etc.  The raw oysters were quite amazing and the clams too. Recommend getting both as well.  Understaffed long wait, but definitely worth it.",

IT IS THAT GOOD!!!! 1st the portions of seafood, they do not shy away of giving you huge portions. From very large shrimps to every spoonful bite of REAL crab meat and REAL lobster meat. May I add, I had about 7 pieces of huge shrimps on my soup.  its a really must go when you visit vegas. the prices are just right for the amount of seafood you get in your soup. also the chefs really interacts with you which is a plus.  have gone here 3x already and will keep coming back for more. :))",

Let's just say the expectations were sky-high at this moment.   Right after we parked, we briskly strolled over to the bar joint. There were about 8-9 people in front of us and equated to 45 mins of waiting time from when we were seated. And consider this waiting time being lucky folks.   If southern gumbo seafood cuisine excited on the west coast, Oyster Bar has the recipe down pat, I pinky promise!!   Pros: +stomach was happy and generous portion, had enough for leftover +excellent staff and waiters (waitresses) and chefs +was social and met some locals by striking up conversations in line waiting +the hype was real and exceeded my expectations +extended hours to 24 hours  Cons: -extreme wait...ing...in ...line... -limited seating  -the smoke and alcohol can make you dizzy (Yes, located inside a casino!)  I was recommended the combo pan roast as a newbie and didn't disappoint!! 2 thumbs up! Watch out, Oyster Bar, I will be singing your high praises until my dying breath!! ^.^ Also, how could I forget to add the fresh dozen oysters!!!

While waiting we indulged in some oyster shots and conversation with the chef, and then finally! The pan roast was served! Creamy, flavorful and enormous portion. I ordered Combination Pan Roast with shrimp, crab, and lobster. I don't know why I waited sooo long to try it! oh I know why, the never ending wait. I don't know if Pan Roast is worth 2+ hour wait, but I'm definitely a fan!",

Yeah, but it was the only time I had a car, and I'm not into standing in line for food.  But I woke up early and ended up rolling on in shortly after 8am to an absolutely empty bar.  Winner winner chicken dinner!  I had a terrific meal of Alaskan chowder $18.95 and a terrific time due to the staff behind the counter.  Maybe I made my way through half the humongous bowlful?  But I took the rest back with me.  Personally, I enjoyed the Oldies music playing in the background.  For fillers, they offered me a sourdough bun and a bowlful of wrapped oyster crackers.  When there's a wait, even for take-out you'd have to wait in line!  Patrons must be age 18+ because they are considered a bar.",

When you arrive, you'll be surprised at how unassuming it is, quietly blending into the sea of slot machines. However, if you're lucky enough to go at an hour where the line doesn't give away its location, the aroma surely will.  Get the Combo Pan Roast, and ask for it with a spice level of 4 if you're unsure of how spicy you can handle it.

Every time out of town friends visit, this is my \"go to\" restaurant.  I really love this place.  I know there is always a long wait so that's not the problem.  The problem was that I didn't enjoy my meal by any stretch.  The pan roast which is the only main dish I always get was terrible.  There was crab shell in every other bite I took, literally every other bite and at times every bite.  I had to stop midway because it was that annoying and painful.   Of course I expect to come across some crab shells but when it takes over the meal, it's no longer enjoyable.  It was so overwhelming that I took them off the napkin to photograph it so you can get an idea of how many times I had to clear shells from my mouth (such a poor experience) In addition to the debris, the steamed rice was so undercooked and grainy that they crunched between my teeth, I could barely tell if I was chewing on shell or rice.  To add assault to injury, the spice level was much higher than what was requested and to top it off, Heavy Handed Harry went crazy with the sage.  I'm sad to say that the sage was so overpowering that I could barely taste the seafood.  The combination of debris, crunchy rice, far too much sage, and the heat made this experience such a poor one that I can't see myself showing this place off to friends anymore (not knowing what they'll get)  I'm wondering if they've gotten so busy that they're too rushed (hence the undercooked rice) or if the chef just had a bad day.  Either way I must say that this was an experience I won't soon forget.  So disappointed",

We got there at 2:30 am on Wednesday and there were about 4 other people in front of us.  After about 30 minutes my party was able to sit and ordered oysters and the pan roast.  Oysters are very fresh and shucked right in front of you.  The oysters are very plump and are served with cocktail and horseradish.  After we were finished with our oysters we noticed that a couple parties ahead of us still had not received their entrees.  We found out each pan roast takes about 20 minutes to make and since there are only 6 pots it may take a while.  This was my first experience with pan roast and i thought it was pretty good.  You get a pretty big bowl with lots of seafood.  Oyster bar is located inside Palace Station (away from the strip) and you must be at least 21 years old to sit.  I would hate to experience the wait during peak hours so try to stop by on the weekday in the early morning.",

    "text": "With all the fancy buffets and all you can eat sushi and world famous chefs in vegas, believe it or not, this place was my favorite meal of this trip.  I'm not sure if i was just over the busy flashy lights and glitz and glamor of the strip but it was just nice to have a simple, delicious, down to earth meal that didn't try to seduce you with a famous Chef name or fancy plating.  I ordered the etouffee ($21.99) and also had a taste of the house gumbo ($23.99) and the combo pan roast ($23.99) all came with shrimp, crab and lobster.  The shrimps where whole pieces they were nice size, the crab was jumbo lump and was shredded and mixed throughout, it added a lot of body to each dish, the lobster was just tiny pieces and personally i think i could do without it.  My favorite was the gumbo or the etouffee, they had a bolder flavor than the pan roast which was more creamy.  I could see why they said that their pan roast is the most popular dish, i just prefer a more savory flavor over creamy.  The pan roast was so creamy, it almost reminded me of a rich bisque.  Each dish is made to order in its own individual kettle, you can also choose your own level of heat, i ordered my Etouffee a level 5, the gumbo a 4 and the pan roast a 6.  I liked the spice level on the etouffee and the pan roast but wished the gumbo was hotter, but it wasn't my dish so no complaints.  I usually don't care for Cajun food, its very rare that i find a place that i like, i think its because its made fresh and the shrimp is cooked fresh, where as normally everything is stewed for a long time and the shrimp is overdone and rubbery.  But this one blew me away so much that i also ordered a gumbo to go and had it for breakfast then next day.  It's a small bar in the middle of Palace Station, which is more of a locals casino.  With only 17 seats even a seemingly short line was over an hour half, but well worth it.  Its open 24 hours so maybe you'd have a better shot during odd hours.  Service was excellent!  I mean they are right there across you behind the counter, and they make everything to order.  Note:  1.  Kids are not allowed sorry. 2.  They do take out, but you still have to stand in the same line to order.",

There was about 6 people waiting in line ahead of us at around 3am, and we were seated a little over an hour after arriving. The chefs were friendly and worked as fast as they could, but food took about 20-30 minutes to be served. I decided on a half dozen oysters ($10 between 1-9am) and the highly raved about Combo Pan Roast ($23.99).   The oysters were freshly shucked and some of the best I've ever had. I can't compare my pan roast to other places since I've never had it before, but it's a really thick stew made out of brandy, tomato and cream. The Combo Pan Roast was full of large pieces of crab, lobster and shrimp and had the perfect amount of spice for my taste at a level 8. It was super rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious. The serving was enough for two people, so I had plenty to take home with me. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

He wanted to eat oysters, so while looking on Yelp, this was the first to pop up.  I read the reviews prior to going and saw all these reviews about the combo seafood pan roast, the wait, and the oysters during their happy hour time.  This place is a bar, with limited seating. However is open 24/7. We arrived at midnight and didn't get seated til about 1a. I almost fell asleep in line, so my husband and I decided to take turns gambling while the other stood in line.   He ordered 2 dozen oysters just for himself along with calm chowder and wow..we were very impressed! Oysters were a decent size and was nicely priced because it was their happy hour pricing. I think $9.99 for a dozen? The clam chowder was full of seafood and flavor.   I ordered the combo seafood pan roast at a 6 spice level (I am Laotian and can eat very spicy and thought 6 was just right, even had a kick), I was going to go for 10, so glad I didn't. You can get the scoop of rice in the pan roast, but I decided to get it on the side.   It's such a great experience because the cooks are pretty attentive and they cook it right in front of you! It really looks like a bowl of orange/red nothing, but man, oh man, wait til you take your first bite. I was amazed, my eyes lit up lol. It was so worth the wait! I couldn't finish it all, so they packed it to go for us and was still good to eat the next day when you warm it up. But I will warn you, the crushed peppers in the soup sits in there overtime, it tasted a lot spicier the next morning.  Definitely making a stop to come back the next time we are in Vegas. So glad it's open all day/night!",

No lie, was totally worth it!  They prepare the food in some pots right in front of you and they do not skimp on the amount of crab or shrimp they put in your dish.  I had the etouffe while my wife had the pan roast-both were outstanding.  Wife ordered oysters and convinced me to try one, was disgusting, but I never liked oysters.  However she said it was some high quality oysters, to me, it tasted like ocean.  If you're really hungry you might want to factor in at least an hour wait or bring some almonds or something.  Bottom line, place is worth the wait!",

    "text": "Worth the wait even late. Oyster bar palace station has arguably one of the best.. well um, oyster bar in town.  You really do have to come later to enjoy this place though, the wait gets crazy. There's only a couple seats situated at the seemingly awkwardly placed bar in the casino but once they sit you down you're always immediately greeted with a consistently friendly host no matter how busy they are.  So far I've tried the bouillabaisse ($23) and the combination pan roast. Both were packed with flavor, the boulliabaisse with a more liquidy broth and the pan roast had a thicker sauce.   Personally I say get the combo pan roast, the bowl is pretty large enough to make 2 meals out of or you can share with a friend so it's worth its value. Pick your spiciness wisely too, for myself a 6/10 is both comfortable and tasteful enough that it doesn't ruin the flavor of your bowl (pan roast & toilet).  The oysters are also pretty decent. Although they aren't the most fresh ones I've ever had, they are passible if you're craving a good dozen. But really the pan roasts and bowls are where it's at.  Stop by around 3am when the lines start to die down and when you're done, make sure you pick yourself up a quick $2 dollar margarita on the way out of the casino to seal the deal!",

I selected a spice level of 8, which I think might be a bit too much.  It was still good but it masked some of the flavor of the broth.  I would suggest getting a 7 or less to really taste the broth.",

    "text": "This is going to be my most bipolar review to date.  Let me start by saying that any place that can start me off with oysters on a half shell, and a couple beers from the jump gains my seal of approval. The oysters were very fresh! They definitely weren't slimy or smell like they've been in a bus tub full of melted ice all day. For an entree, my girlfriend and I both decided to go with the Lobster Pan-Roast. I am convinced that they give you a whole lobster in the pan roast, maybe even two--so if its portions that you're looking for, expect a lot of lobster. The sauce was amazing too, I asked for my heat to be at a 7 out of 10, but it tasted more like a 8.5 out of 10. I kind of want to come back to see what 10 feels like. Overall, the food is absolutely amazing, and the staff seemed very happy to be there.  Here's the bad. Like, really bad. So bad in fact that I will only come if I'm close and if I'm craving lobster. The seating system here is SHIT. Absolute shit. Yes, I understand that theres about 20 seats, (19 to be exact when my girlfriend and I ate there), and I understand that when the bar gets full, that means they're at capacity. My girlfriend and I got in line with 8 people waiting in line. With 19 seats, and 8 people in line, we figured we couldn't wait more than an hour. Not bad. We have waited an hour to be seated on multiple occasions. Here's the part that pissed me off. One of those people in the line of 8 was holding a spot for a party of 10, and another one individual held a spot for a party of 8. That's fucking bullshit! If were using a line system, the entire party needs to physically be there, or should give the rest of the line some kind of discretion. It took us 2 hours and 15 minutes to wait. They need to make a sign up list, or at least have a host. Its a popular restaurant for Christ sake! Get a host! Or have a server have a check list and check it whenever they seat you!  Overall, the food was fire. Absolutely amazing! Was it worth the 2 hours and 15 minutes? Hell no. Get a better seating system!!!!!!!!!!",

We talked to Patrick the manager but he only made excuses for her. We wrote a report and will follow up with corporate on Monday. We want our money back. It was absolutely horrible.",

I crave the Louisiana Style cuisine served here and get so excited whenever I think about it!   Located in the Palace Station Hotel and Casino, the Oyster Bar is very popular and often has a line to get in. Don't be discouraged; the line moves. The wait is worth it!  We went for lunch at 1:30 pm. There were about ten people in line but we were seated 45 minutes later. The restaurant has about 18 seats that face the kitchen, where you can observe the chef work his magic. Watching him multitask, cooking everyone's dishes individually while restocking and prepping is amazing to see.    Anyway, the menu was straightforward. We ordered:   ***1/2 Dozen Raw Clams ($11.99) - Served on a bed of ice. FRESH!! We watched the waitress crack them open. Raw clams and raw oysters are my favorite!  ***House Gumbo ($23.99) - Served with Shrimp, Crab and Lobster. All gumbos come with andouille sausage and okra but we added more crab ($5.99) and okra ($2.99). Served with a scoop of rice on the side, this dish is heavenly! I savored every bite. This is my favorite.   ***Combo Pan Roast ($23.99) - Served with Shrimp, Crab and Lobster. This was recommended by the waitress because she said this was very popular. I compared the sauce to a tomato bisque. It was okay. I preferred the house gumbo soup by far.   The Oyster Bar can spice things up for you if you want. Their levels: 1-3 Amateur; 4-7 We Are Impressed; 8-10 We Dare You. Lol. Needless to say, I ordered my dish at level 1.   FYI, we ordered to-go orders of the House Gumbo and brought them home to Hawaii with us. (For those wondering, my Aunty who lives there froze them for us and we checked it in our baggage). It was just as good and such a wonderful treat!  Thank you to the staff at the Oyster Bar for always making our experience so wonderful. We will continue to return every time we are in Las Vegas......",

Searched up oysters and seen this was 24 hours and less then 10 mins away. Drove there and sat down in a bar like area as they greeted us. what my boyfriend ordered was some kind of pan seafood combo and it's a favorite. He got his at a 4 spice level (pussy)... jk. His was more of a creamy tomatoe texture and he got it with pasta noodles instead. I like how they cook everything in front of us. I got my half dozen oysters on ice with the fixings and it tasted soooo good. Just satisfied my cravings. I also ordered what the dude suggested for me was a favorite. I forgot the name of it but it's something like bouillon with a bunch of seafood in it, I mean I think it had lobster if I'm not mistaken it looked like the tail but cut three ways. It had huge pieces of shrimp, crab legs and mussels. It was very very delicious and I had it with a side of rice and spice level 10. I said if u can do 12 that's perfect but he asked am i sure and said i was crazy lmao! I get that a lot and I get it cus they don't want us customers dying off they food. But I assured him I could take it! He said ok ima just do a 9 for u cus I want u to be able to taste it since it's your first time. Threw me off cus I wanted what I  wanted but I get it and it was fine cus I do want to taste. They made that to go and even let me taste some in a bowl with rice jus so I don't go saying they made it too spicy which it wasn't. It was perfect!.. left off satisfied and full! Will be stopping by again whenever we take another trip to Vegas!",

There have been times where I have waited 3 hours at 3am. For starters, I really enjoy their Manhattan clam chowder. It's more of a tomato base soup rather then cream like New England. Then I usually go for the combo pan roast with extra lobster. Shrimp , crab , and lobster with a side of rice. Can you really go wrong? The chefs are usually interactive and friendly. The waitress/assistant is always on top of refills and anything else you may need. The prices are really fair for what you get. Also be aware that you will have little to no reception while inside the palace station. Bring a friend and chow down.   The chefs are going to hate me for this but if you enjoy a little spice in your life . Kindly ask them to make some lava sauce for you. It'll change your life!",

It was a Monday night and I wasn't expecting much people but it's Vegas, people are up at wee hours doing god knows what, like eat.

Oysters were flavorful, but pretty basic. Pan roasts and gumbo were fantastic.  Lots of seafood in the dish; lots of flavor.  Service is actually quite nice and unrushed (which is fine once you are seated but can be tough when in line.)  Only suggestion is an extra busser to help clean up and move things along.",

The food is worth the wait though. Shrimp cocktail- lovely large shrimp with spicy cocktail sauce- yum.  Lump crab cocktail equally yummy. The house gumbo is excellent ( a Louisiana native rating) and the pan roast was delish! Well worth a try! Steve our waiter was friendly, great attitude and service!",

I freaking LOVE this place! The portions are large and very shareable, and the food is consistently flavorful and fresh. The staff is super attentive and friendly too--mind you this is just a 24 hour booth thing in a randomish casino off The Strip!  Everything is good, but my routine usually includes a bowl of New England clam chowder, an order of (any) pan roast and a dozen oysters.  I always get an order of each of these dishes and split it with a friend.  This is usually plenty of food, and our meals for 2 are about $50 total.   The wait time varies, depending on when you come. I always come between 9pm-1am, and the wait is usually about an hour.  I once stayed in Vegas for 2 weeks, and after the 5th day, The Strip began to slowly lose its luster.  However, unless the quality of food changes, my love for this place will never dwindle away.  P.S. This is my first 5 star review ever. ;)",

The usual cook took a break just as we sat down and the back-up needed to check the menu posted on the wall to determine what ingredients were to be used.  We each ordered bouillabaisse which comes with rice and bread that we barely touched.  Once again this was the best we have found in Las Vegas; literally loaded with seafood though the promised cod was MIA and the crab legs very small.

The oysters are always so fat and juicy and I always have to get a dozen. I also always get the combination pan roast.

    "text": "THE HOLY GRAIL OF HEARTY SEAFOOD AND STEWS. I loved this little place. I must go again before I leave Vegas!   Arrived at the Palace Casino after a couple of hours of walking with rumbling tummies through the strip. We knew we were going to eat here so we tried to save our appetites. Not recommended next time since we did not know how long we'd be in line. Once we got in line around 5 pm on Wednesday I saw we had 8 people in front of us (4 couples). The little old group of senior citizens behind my friend and I had the 99 cent margarita slushies offered by the casino so while I held the line my friend went off in search of two. He came back with them and they were super sweet and cold but yummy refreshment and not strong at all. The line moved along and 45 minutes later we and the two couples before us were seated (6 people) in a row down at the front of the bar.   Our efficient servers took our drink orders and our drinks and bread buns along with butter were brought out promptly. Couldn't tell if the bread was just funny tasting or sour dough but that's not the point since I was there for the star of the menu! My friend ordered the house gumbo and I ordered the combination pan roast by yelp's recommendation and NEVER LOOKED BACK. Took another 45 mins to an hour or so for everyone's food to come out and by this time my friend was ravenous but once the first couple's entrees were ready so was ours so no complaints on time and kudos to the awesome chef Ez (Ez? EZ? Idk) on his time management. The man deserves a pay raise.  Let me just say that you can taste the love in this soup so much you feel like getting married. You feel like carrying it away from the table, bowl and all, and booking a hotel suite upstairs. You feel like no matter how long they tell you to wait for your pan roast, the wait will be worth it. It's that good. My friend's gumbo I thought couldn't possibly beat my pan roast but lo and behold idk how they did it but they managed to make more than one star soup selection on the menu equally competitive as the other. Actually, by the other reviewers pretty much the whole menu can compete with each other, it all just depends on your taste. I love gumbo and also the pan roast. The options seem endless now, it might just tear me apart to order something other than the pan roast. I may have to not so subtly direct everyone I bring here to order something else under the pretense that we will \"share\" *wink wink*.   Then, as if she sensed my conflicting emotions within Rayma our server asked if we had ever tried their chowder. She responded to our no with a little soup bowl of their New England style clam chowder for us to share. I could've cried, it was pretty great too! Nearly wanted to order a bowl of it to go but the portion they gave me of pan roast was so huge I decided next time. By the time we finished our meal it was nearing 9 pm and we were not so pleasantly full, with huge smiles as we chatted with the friendly couples next to us. We got our bills and tipped extra for the awesome service and great food. Our leftovers (half his gumbo, 2/3 my pan roast) was enough for three hungry people to share, which we did once we got home (kind of regretting it now). Since I was the least food comatose I had driven. Ahh, if the valet could've only drove us home it would have been heaven. Overall, a successful and great experience. I am going back again every single time I stop in Vegas.",

    "text": "First thing, it's worth the wait to get excellent fresh seafood at about 1/2 the price of most places.  I went with a colleague from England and although we waited at least 45 min. to get seated at the bar, which seats maybe 16-18, when we got our beers and were anticipating the meal, we were like \"that wait was nothing, man!\".  Started with a dozen huge gulf oysters on the half shell and they were great!  I had the Bouillabaisse which was a little different to what I'm used to (the broth was a little thicker with more tomato base, and served with rice rather than crusty bread); however it was fabulous indeed, loaded with clams, mussels, big shrimp, pieces of king crab leg, and sea scallops.  Yeah it was good!    My associate had a lobster pan roast, and though I'm not familiar with that, he said it was great as well.  He's not your usual Brit because he grew up in France and loves his seafood too.  It's a good show as well because the chef prepares everything in front of you in these contraptions that are hooked up to some kind of steam system.  Very clever and it works, the chef keeping up a rapid-fire commentary the whole time.  A good show with great seafood at good price, what could be better.  I probably won't be back in LV anytime soon, which is too bad because I'd like to try the gumbo, chowder, and many of the other items on the menu.  Free parking in the casino garage as well.  It's a little off the strip but worth a try for sure.  One more thing, it's right on the casino floor and open 24 hrs so if/when I go back to LV, I'm staying there!",

    "text": "Wow! Who knew that of all places, that Las Vegas would be one of the spots to have one of the best seafood places to actually grab some fresh, quality food at decent prices?  This bar seems to fill up early, so try to get here as early as possible unless you don't mind waiting in line for your chance to sample some of what they have to offer.  It's located in Palace Station and even with the simple atmosphere, serves some of the most mouth watering food I've ever had in Las Vegas.  We started off we a dozen oysters (not sure what kind) on a half shell. The flesh was nicely sweet, with a hint of brine, it was perfect paired with the lemon and tabasco. *drool  I also had a bowl of the New England clam chowder which wasn't full of salt (where most places fail miserably with the sodium levels). The milk and potatoes, nicely complimented the sweet, slightly briney chucks (not tiny morsels) of clam meat. *double drool  My friends and I decided to grab a couple bowls of their Etouffee, Combo Roast, and Bouillabaisse.  The Etouffee consisted of nicely sized pieces of fresh shrimp, crab, and lobsters in a somewhat spicy (had a nice, slight kick) stew. I thought it was Gumbo, but it wasn't. Fail me. The seafood tasted really fresh and the stew was nice and hearty. I even poured some of it on top of my rice that they offer with the dishes. *triple drool  The Combo Roast reminded me of a lightly sweet lobster bisque that also had shrimp and crab in it. There wasn't pieces of the sexy shellfish, but more like a light bisque base soup. It was flavored really nicely and I just wish it had pieces of the shellfish (pieces) inside of being blended into the soup.  The Bouillabaisse was slightly like the combo roast above, without it being a bisque of sorts, with pieces of the seafood for you to see. It was more of a seafood stew with lots of morsels of crab, cod, prawns, lobster, mussels, and clams. The seafood wasn't scarce and neither was the flavor. *Quadruple drool  Just writing out this review makes me want to go back and hopefully we do! This is a great \"out of the box/strip\" place to go to for fabulous seafood and the waitress' and chef are really friendly and engage in conversation with all the patrons.   If you're in the mood for really great seafood, come here and avoid the \"seafood restaurant\" across the street.",

Rolled up with 4 friends for late night grub...late night as in 6am, and the Chef Ricardo recommended the Combo Roast.  Let me tell you, this is one of the best things I've ever tasted.  Forget the fact that it's $20, they hook it up!  It comes in a large bowl with all you want jasmine rice and bread.  It's filled with shrimp, lobster and crab and Ricardo makes it right in front of you.  You can choose the spice level 1-10, 8 should be good enough for those who like just a hint of spice.  The cream they mix in at the end is the secret ingredient - it's a mixture of different seafood broths and a heavy cream.  To me it's the definition of \"umami.\"  If you want something great to eat and don't mind cabbing it over to Palace Station (located on west side of strip, north of Rio), this is the place TO GO!  Ricardo is a good guy - he's make good conversation, tells jokes, talks about his experiences, and genuinely enjoys your company.  Tell him it's your first time and he'll hook you up.  This place was so good we ended up going the next day at 6am again to have the exact same thing.",

    "text": "Wow. An amazing place. One of the best places if you want some serious grub! This oyster bar is right in the middle of the Palace Station casino. The whole place is just a bar where you sit. There are no tables, just stools.  I had the Linguine and Clams White Sauce. Talk about over load on the clams. They are not skimpy on this. The taste was delicious. I even tried the Bloody Mary Oyster shooters - these do have alcohol so watch out!  The one thing is that you will most likely wait in a line. But you can go over the menu and play some slots while you're waiting. But trust me it is worth the wait.  Not super cheap but it's priced right for what you get. I would come back here for sure!   This is my first time here but I was talking to a guy that goes there often and he was saying that you can't go wrong with pretty much anything that you order. I believe him.  Bring your appetite and prepared to be impressed.",

We loose more money there than anywhere else in Vegas but keep going back for this oyster bar. The ciopino is great at a 8. I have had it all. Best cooks, Bob and Ricardo. Flavor is unique to each entree. Seafood is fresh and I don't eat seafood anywhere because I grew up on fresh seafood. Even without the heat the food is good.

We went with the combo (crab, shrimp, lobster) for $19.99 as opposed to the Palace Station special (crab, shrimp, chicken, andouille) for $22.99. Next time, I definitely wanna try that gumbo. The dude makes the stuff right in front of you and the gumbo looked ulous-redonk also.  I'd give five stars, but their line system is a little messed up. It seems as though your entire party doesn't have to be present when you're seated. For example, two of your four-person-party can sit and eat and then the other two can return and they can take your place and eat. I guess it makes sense for the casino--allow the guests to roam around and drop cheese into the poker machines--but it's a little frustrating when you've been waiting for about an hour.  That's another thing. Is it one-hour-wait good? I'm on the fence. Maybe 8pm on a Friday night wasn't the best time to go. I'll keep this place in my back pocket for 2am hunger pangs.",

But if you're lucky enough to snag one of the 15 seats at the counter, you won't be disappointed.   Pan roast is the most popular item, it's rich and creamy base of either seafood or sausage or a combo of all. I would recommend just seafood or add sausage, the have the Palace Pan Roast which comes with chicken but that adds nothing to the dish. They do give you very large meaty shrimps if you order the ones that comes with it. The side of rice they give you is the perfect vessal to soak up all the yummy goodness.   The oysters are reasonably priced, very meaty. The horseradish sauce has a nice kick.  Chowders are also very good, tons of seafood and clams.  I like the ciopino too, again tons of seafood and large juicy shrimp.  This is 4 not 5 stars because depending on whose cooking, sometimes the dishes aren't as good. My last visit here I think they were switching shifts and the new guy started our 5 dishes, then ran around looking for something, left our food to cook/burn on the cookers and left and the other guy had to quickly finish it off. They tasted OK but I know it could have been better if our chef had cooked our food correctly. And for the ladies, make sure you bring a jacket because the location is right under an air vent and it's always freezing at the bar.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time but I've heard stories about the wait, which is the reason why I haven't tried it sooner. I'm not exactly a patient person, haha. We went to Vegas with my friends who come here every single time and they claimed the wait was worth it so we gave it a try. We got there around 5 PM. Don't be fooled by the look of the line! I thought it was short but we ended up waiting 2.5 hours for four seats. It's LITERALLY a bar with about 15 seats total. It took an additional 40 minutes to get our food cause there are only 6 pots (the food is cooked right in front of you). Was it worth it? Hmmm..... debatable...   My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters ($19.99) and the combo pan roast ($23.99). The oysters were only ok, forgot to ask them where they're from. The pan roast was the highlight. It was SOOO creamy and delicious. Honestly I would LOVE to eat it again, I just don't know if I would wait that long. One of the dealers told my boyfriend the wait is usually like this, except on weekdays which you'd only have to wait about 20 minutes. We're never here on weekdays!!! The service was pretty good once we were seated. However, they were sort of slow on clearing the tables. This couple that we met was on a time crunch. They waited same amount of time as us, and they were next in line but the servers did not clear up the spot for them to sit! They ended up having to leave. I felt so bad! 2.5 hours wasted! So I would only recommend going here if you have absolutely no plans. The friends we made in line made the wait much more bearable.",

    "text": "This is definitely a good place to eat if you are a fan of creamy, seafoody based soups, chowders and gumbo. However the menu isn't too extensive so if you are a picky eater, it's probably best you move on and eat at a different spot.  As the 1000 other reviewers mentioned, the limited seating+popularity of this place = long lines at all hours of the day. We went early (Vegas early) on a Sunday morning and the wait wasn't too bad, but there was still a wait.  Our chef was super friendly and amazing at multitasking. Between socializing with  customers and cooking the pan roasts and chowders, he was shucking oysters and cleaning pots... He asked me if it was my first time and I told him I had been to the Chino location before but not the Vegas one and he said that the Chino location and the Santa Ana locations were actually unaffiliated with the Oyster Bar. Those were started by a former chef of the Vegas location... In comparison to the unaffiliated \"Boiler\" in Chino, the taste and the price of the pan roast are pretty similar.  The biggest difference is the Boiler has a much larger menu.  I got the house special pan roast but next time I will order the crab pan roast. The house special had way too many shrimp (I think there were 8 or 9), a few overcooked lobster pieces that was a bit rubbery and not enough crab. I usually order a 6 or 7 spice level but this time I opted for a 2 because I wanted to try some of the many complimentary hot sauces....However I tried some of my fiance's very hot and spicy gumbo (he got an 8) and after singeing my tastebuds, I decided to try non spicy food for a change. The pan roast is so creamy and salty, it tastes just fine on its own.  Service is good considering there is only one server and one busser, but this place could really benefit from an expansion.",

There was only 1 cook and 1 waiter/busser/food runner working their asses off, and 1 other person not doing much other than clearing out buckets of dirty plates, attempt to shuck clams, failing, and then getting the cook to do it for him. It is only possible for 6 orders to be cooking at once, and each pot takes around 45 minutes to cook. Almost 3 hours have passed (T_T). At this point, we're just so tired and worn out that nearly nothing would be worth this long of a wait.   To cap it off, while we were waiting for our orders to finish cooking, they reloaded their pots of gumbo base and pan roast base out front for everyone's viewing pleasure. Not quite something I wanted to see! The gumbo looked like minced up dog food and the pan roast looked like someone's vomit.   Stick with the Combination Pan Roast. Imagine a seafood-loaded tomato soup with rice. The Etouffee was excessively salty and nearly inedible.  All in all, Oyster Bar was not worth venturing off the strip for. However, if you do  decide to go, I recommend going at the beginning of your Vegas trip, when you may have more patience to wait for things.",

If I don't organize this I'll go on raving for centuries so I'll make a list of awesome:  1) There's a particular guy that works here, he's the only server/host/food runner. That man, is Steve. He seats all the guests, he takes all the orders, he brings you the food, and he is simply, amazing. He must see thousands of people a week, but he recognizes us when we come in and is as attentive as the amount of business will allow, which is impressive. He is a large part of why we come here.   2) The food is absolutely amazing. I've had the Clam Chowder, I think New England (?) but I usually stick to a pan roast with an extra scoop of rice. It's amazing. I can't go on enough about it. I literally dream about it. I'm salivating as I write this.   3) Despite the fact that its in my least favorite casino and I will normally do anything to avoid it (the casino), I will still come in here, and wait up to 30 minutes standing, in cigarette soaked air, simply because I love this place so much.   10 stars!",

Despite it being open 24/7 palace station has a gem and must eat and visit! Never had pan roast this heavenly! Think I'm kidding just give it a try!  you won't be disappointed!!",

    "text": "We will not be coming here again.  This is the first time we came with kids.  A one year old and three year old.  We were just going to order to go.  We were waiting in line and a rude casino representative came up to us and said we either both had to step out of line or one of us has to walk around with both kids.  That kids aren't allowed at the oyster bar.  I told her we were only going to order to go, she said nope sorry, you have to keep moving, that's the rule.  It's the way she said it too, she enjoyed implementing a rule on us.    This is a stupid rule, but even if it was a rule, this is one you could just look the other way.  We have two kids, each of one is holding one, we are only ordering to go.  I was so upset.  My wife wanted to go, but I knew she really wanted it.  So I decided to take both kids back to the car and get the stroller, and stroll them around.  The lil one ends up doing number two that overflowed.  It was a nightmare changing diapers and handling both at the same time.  I will not be back.  With a lil research, I found out there is another same exact restaurant inside South Point, and many other similar type of pan roast around the same area.  We have kids now, I wont be back to a place that is so NOT Kid Friendly.  There is better ways to handle the situation.  One, look the other way, not a big deal at all.  Two, Ask to take our order and come back in 45 minutes.  Or come back in 45 minutes to place order.  You could be more accommodating, no so mean and rude.   The casino representative was an older black lady working at the rewards center at 5PM on Tuesday, April 22nd.  Nothing against black people, just describing so the management could figure out who was working at that time.",

    "text": "The absolute best & authentic New Orleans dishes. I always order the house pan roast every time I'm in Vegas or passing through Vegas I stop here to eat. I've been wanting to try there oysters, maybe next time. I get so full off the house pan I probably couldn't fit oysters in my tummy. I hate the fact that it's such a small place, therefore seating is very limited. I've waited, standing up for 2 hours to eat here the last time. There's no seats to seat and wait around in. It's a line through the casino, you have to stand in and wait. Since it's a bar, there's no children allowed. I've seen a lady be turned away after waiting over 1 hour because she had her baby with her. They would make so much more money if they had more seats. People end up walking away because there either too hungry or can't stand anymore. I'm a die hard fan of the pan roast so walking away isn't an option for me :)",

Figured we could keep going and make our epic wait in line worth the trip, and ordered *another* appetizer (half dozen clams + half dozen mussels... the best I've had); by this time we had put ourselves in the most massive food coma, LOL. Everything is made in front of you and prepared to perfection! This is the ultimate foodie experience in Vegas, especially if you love seafood.",

The first time we didn't have to wait very long, but the second time we waited over an hour to get seated and then another hour to get our food.   Both times that we've dined here, the food has been amazing and by far the best places to get a seafood \"stew\" type dish (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=0JYwGw6l0a1dpuCwqhZ2Yw#0JYwGw6l0a1dpuCwqhZ2Yw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4...</a>). The highlight of dining at the Oyster Bar is their open kitchen, you get to see the chef prepare your food as you enjoy drinks and complimentary bread. They only have 6 pots going at one time and the design of the pots are tilt-able for easy cleaning and serving.   Many people designate a person or two to wait in line while others in your party gamble! A good way to earn those points to comp your meal! =D",

Back story we made friends with some other ppl in line. We all wanted to sit together and enjoy and still chat. Welp I guess the manager was annoyed and thought he was making us pay but adding gratuity. So I watched him tell maleeta to add it in a matter of fact way. Sir, I am a hospitality professional. That was rude af. Take your sour puss attitude to the kitchen like everyone else does. It might be because your bald and wear glasses or your pissed you work grave. Either way get over it.

I came early in the morning so I was just able to sit anywhere and got served instantly.  This was my second time coming here, so I kind of knew the menu. I got the shrimp cocktail and combo panroast.  While the shrimp was alright, I'll be going without it during subsequent visits here. They had decent flavor and texture, but for the amount and quality that I got, I could have saved a couple of bucks.  Now, for the show-stopper. This was the first time I got the legendary pan roast, and it lived up to the hype. Tender pieces of crab, shrimp, and lobster practically swimming throughout the bowl. There was a lot of seafood in that dish and every bite I ate, literally to the last spoonfull, had a combination of seafood in it. The sauce was on point with so much creamy flavor. I could taste the little bits of vegetables throughout. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  I'm going to have to practice some discipline by not coming here multiple times in a week. But I do look forward to getting some more of that awesome pan roast.",

I don't know what took me so long to get over here, when Arvin T came up with the brilliant idea of stopping in after the Zarkana event, I think I was more excited for dinner than I was the show!   We show up around 9pm on a Saturday night and there were only a few people ahead of us in line. With only 20 seats at the bar, you're left staring in envy at the people shoveling spoons of goodness in there mouths. You get excited when someone is handed there check, oh good, they're leaving, we are next!   We are seated and are anxious to order, both of us were so hungry, we contemplated finishing the stew the guy next to us left (just kidding, well maybe) we are given a sourdough roll and some butter, oyster crackers and water. I need food, not fillers.   We start out with a Caesar Salad (this was really, really good by the way) and an order of Fresh Lump Crab app. We were like scavengers trying to find the last pieces of meat on the plate, it was so good! We then had an order of oysters of the half shell, that night it happened to be Gold Band Oysters from Louisiana. They were enormous, and I wasn't a fan. They were served with cocktail sauce and a dollop of horseradish. I'm generally a lover of smaller oysters like Kusshi and Kumamoto or Fanny Bay, I'm not holding this against them, just wasn't a fan of the taste of these oysters.   The finale....the Combo Pan Roast. Served with a side of rice, this was the table favorite. Chunks of crab meat and huge pieces of shrimp throughout the stew. The flavor was unreal. This has been haunting me for two days now.   We were already planning our meal for when we return. I want to come back for the Bouillabaisse or the Cioppino. Arvin has his pick of the Gumbo. Hopefully they'll have some better oysters.",

Unless if you want to come at 3am since they're now open 24hrs.  You have to go with the combo pan roast with extra seafood. It's the original favorite here. 1-10 spice choice. Go with 4 to 5 if you want to taste your seafood instead of the heat.  The oysters can be pretty big and fresh anytime, go figure, it has no after taste. I've had the oyster shots and they're good too. The jambalaya is just so so. Your best choice is the pan roast combo here.  Depending on the chef you could be waiting for hours or not. People will wait in line and I guess that's why they're confident to take their time too other than they know they deliver what you crave for when it comes to Cajun/creole food.",

I waited for TWO HOURS. Be prepared to be really hungry. I would recommend a snack and not go super hungry because you will hate it. The wait is the only downer. I gambled for a bit and switched off with my friends in line. They have less than 20 seats and 8 kettles to cook with. Eah can dish takes about 20 mins or so to prepare.  I ordered the Etouffee (Cajun stew with seafood), half dozen oyster, Combo pan roast, boulliabaise, and crab Caesar salad. Crab salad had huge lumps of crab claws on top of the sauced up Caesar salad. If you don't like your salad drenched, ask for it on the side. I have to say - Etouffee had a better flavor than the pan roast. But don't get me wrong because the pan roast was just as good. Pan roast had more of a creamy base to it and seemed more heavy than the Etouffee. The boulliabaise was alright. It is a French stew with mussels, lobster, crab, shrimp, cod. That dish wasn't my favorite.  I would recommend either Pan roast or the Ettoufee if you never ate here before. If you are in love with oyster - order the half dozen. They get it delivered deom Louisana.  Shout out to EZE. He was our chef and entertained us all the way. Strike up a conversation with him and don't be shy. It makes waiting for the food less worse.",

They are a well oiled machine. Every transition is seamless. Watching the chef cook in the steam kettle was a show.   We ordered oysters, combo pan roast, and New England clam chowder.

This order plus 2 scoops of rice can definitely serve 2 people. This is a must order!  I would recommend skipping on the oysters. While they were good, I would save room for the pan roast and the shrimp and lobster fra Diablo.",

Even when the wait is on average 1.5-2 hours, no matter when you come. My tip is eat a snack while you stand in line, and take turns w/ your friends. Oyster Bar made me appreciate and fall in love w/ oysters. It took me 24 long years to acquire the taste for them. But this hidden (or maybe not no hidden bar now) did the trick. The MOST AMAZINGLY FRESH oysters....add a hint of horseradish, cocktail sauce, and lemon juice... Wabam! You have the most  mouthwatering, orgasmic blend of gooeyness. I know that doesn't sound nearly as pleasant as it tastes. The combo pan roast and linguini and clams are to die for. Everything else like the gumbos, chowders, and pan roasts are good, but these are by far the standouts. This little bar is the only reason the Palace Station hotel attracts people younger than 60.  Warning: Don't come when you're famished. Be prepared to always wait in line since there's only about 16 chairs. But you will enjoy one of the most delightful seafood meals ever.",

I don't know what they do differently to their pan roast but it has the best flavor compared to all the other oyster bars in Vegas. I prefer the crab pan roast, but the combo is delicious too. I have only gotten the pan roast here, so can't really write much about the other things they offer, except the oysters. The oysters here are good too.   The wait for this location sucks though! So be sure to be prepared to wait at least an hour unless you get lucky. The seating is really limited since it's only bar seating.. I don't know why they don't expand a little bit more, but then if they did, maybe it might not be as good anymore. Regardless, if you have the time to wait, it's definitely worth it!",

If you opt not to get the pan roast, try the Alaskan Chowder. This is so amazing and heats up way better for leftovers than the pan roast (rice gets too sticky)",

The quality, freshness and various blends of spices all comes together.  The pan roast is the crown jewel. It's like heaven in a bowl!!! It's basically a lobster bisque type of seafood chowder, with a scoop of white rice. Thick, rich, and served piping hot,  The reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the wait time is 60 to 90 minutes. I was lucky to have only waited 20 minutes on Thursday night going by myself.  I know that's not going to happen all the time, so I consider myself very fortunate.  If this is going to be your first time, I couldn't encourage it more it's worth it!!!",

I only mention this because if you're taking paid transport there, it sucks when there's more than 12 people in line because that could mean a 1.5-3 hr wait. The place is a bar counter with less than 20 seats, and it has 1 chef, 1 guy who acts as host/waiter/bus boy and 1 person who manages the back. Needless to say, they move fast, but food moves slow.   In the end, food is good. I ordered the oysters, clams, combo pan roast and an etouffee... And beer. All was decent to good, but for me the pan roast was too rich/heavy. Because the portions are so big, it's all a bit much.   Long wait. Solid food. Cool guys working in the back. More than reasonable prices. I'll try the linguine or something a little lighter next time.   Robert(o), Chris and Rafael were all on point... Busy guys!",

    "text": "We heard about the famous oyster bar from a friend of ours. We had to try it since we have had the pan roast from the Kettle Bar at the Anaheim Packing House and it haunts my dreams. So since we were in Vegas for the weekend, we had to give it a try!  We went at like 9am to hopefully avoid the crazy lines. We succeeded in our quest! We walked right up to the bar and had a seat. We ordered the combo pan roast ($23.99 - shrimp, crab, and lobster) at a level 3 spiciness (out of 10) and a bowl of the New England clam chowder.  The clam chowder came out first, and Sumana S. told me that it was the best clam chowder she has had. She knows her food so I trusted her. It totally delivered. The clam chowder was nice and creamy and it had a TON of clams in it. The clams were nice and tender. And unlike almost every other clam chowder I've had, the potatoes were not the star of the show. The clams are! As they should be!  The pan roast was super yummy delicious. It was really fun to watch them make it right in front of us. The level 3 was perfect. We're not super spicy people, but we like a tiny bit if heat. However, since I know the amazingness which is the Kettle Bar Pan Roast, I had to make a comparison. The Kettle Bar's version is the tiniest bit better. It's flavor is a little more complex and they have more stuff in theirs (pieces of fish, scallops, and chicken).   However, with that being said, I would come back to the Oyster Bar for breakfast everyday the next time I'm in Vegas!",

I loved the gumbo. We got the combo seafood and there was crab pieces floating around, shrimp, sausage and lobster. Sooo savory and delicious over rice.   If you prefer sweeter and creamier flavors, the pan roast is for you. Like a delicious seafood tomato soup. I still liked it but it was a bit too sweet for me to have an entire bowl of. Also served with a bowl of rice.   The seafood was cooked perfectly (lobster was so tender!) and the portions are hugeee, which is good because they were like $22 each. 3 of us shared the gumbo and pan roast and we couldn't even finish.

We got there on Saturday at 11 am. There were 8 people ahead of us and we waited 30-40 minutes till we got seated. We shared a cup (which is more like a bowl) of the New England Clam Chowder. Delicious! I always get the combo pan roast which comes with giant shrimp, lobster, and crab in a tomato based cream sauce that is cooked right in front of you. Hopefully you are lucky enough to get Chef Bob as he is definitely the man. Watching him work is nothing but a beautiful symphony of organization and sheer talent. His dry sense of humor will have you laughing. We were treated to some vodka oyster shooters by the guy ahead of us in line. They were amazing, just like the pan roast which is so flavorful and delicious you will want it for your last meal. Get there now and thank me later.",

Naturally I turned to my handy-dandy Yelp app, poured through various  reviews of  restaurants serving up this dish, made my choice, decided to give it another try and took him out to lunch at the Oyster bar! His jambalaya was a very good but the main event was definitely the shrimp pan roast!  I  ordered the pan roast at the recommendation of the woman behind the counter. Thankfully, I only looked at the stars when making my decision to eat here (yes, normally I like to read the reviews first ) had I read the reviews first I might not have walked in the door as I did not have three hours to wait in line. Karma and good timing were our side today as we walked right in and we're promptly seated. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator... \"I'll be back!\"",

    "text": "This place beats all other pan roasts by a landslide!!   - You must order the combo pan roast ($23.99) - it's a great deal! Comes with abundant crab, shrimp, and lobster. It's super creamy, savory, and overall dee-lish. MMmmMmm - I'm craving another bowl now..  - The combo appetizer ($19.99) comes with cocktail jumbo shrimp (3), raw oysters (3), and raw clams (3). The shrimp has a special flavor to it, I think a little nutmeg? Try it out! Also, lots of different hot sauce bottles to sample with your seafood.  - Complimentary bread and butter upon seating.   - Because of the limited seating (about 20 stools only), each chair is ultra-valuable. I've waited up to 1.5 hours before to get seated. Again, super worth it. You can order a $0.99 margarita at the nearby casino stand while you wait.   Enjoy all! :)",

The Good: The food without a doubt, didn't hear a single complaint from other customers. I ordered the combo pan roast...oh Lord, what an amazing dish...the best food I ever tried in my life. The service was really good too. The Chef (Jared) was simply outstanding with all customers.  The Bad: What else?? the wait of course, but based on other reviews, my 55 minute wait wasn't bad at all considering it was a Saturday at 12:30pm. Also, this place deserves more than 16 chairs without a doubt.  Final assessment: Outstanding food, great service and location. A jewel no doubt. I'll be back!!!",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday Night not knowing what to expect. My boyfriend was raving about this place and wanted to take me here for dinner. Beware that the restaurant can only seat 16 people and it might take you a while before you get seated. We ended up waiting about 2 hours to get seated at the bar and almost another hour for the food to be prepared/cooked. So if you plan on coming here, be prepared to endure a long wait or come at an odd hour to avoid a long line!  We ordered the Raw Oysters, Combo Pan Roast with Lobster, Crab, & Shrimp, and the Seafood Gumbo. The Raw Oysters were delicious and tasted really fresh. I would say they're pretty comparable to the oysters in Seattle. It tasted fabulous with the fresh lemon juice & marina sauce.   The Pan Roast was also DELICIOUS and the best I have yet. I liked that the broth was really creamy but didn't have an overpowering taste of seafood. The sauce was so addicting and I just couldn't get enough. Good thing the portions here are huge! They were also really generous with their seafood portions and the lobster was cooked beautifully!  As for the Gumbo, I will have to pass next time. The gumbo was just way too salty and I ended up getting tired of it after a few bites. I didn't bother getting my order to go because I knew I wasn't going to be able to enjoy it later.   Overall the food was good but I wouldn't say it's worth waiting 2-3 hours in line for. I would recommend trying out this place if you're able to go at an odd time. If you're trying to go during peak time then good luck and be sure to wear some comfy shoes!",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this place is called the oyster bar because the oysters are definitely not the highlight at this restaurant. They serve one type, which were bland and just ok.  My advice ... Skip the oysters and save your appetite for the soups.  Because their soups are SO SO good! I understand why people will wait -sometimes up to 3 hours - for their favorite dish.    I had the combo pan roast, which consisted of lots of crab meat, shrimp, and large chunks of lobster. The soup base was one of the best tomato bisque soups I've had. It's served with a scoop of rice and sourdough bread.  I had a spicy level 5 which was perfect.   I tasted the gumbo, which hubby ordered.  Different flavor profile from mine, but packed with a lot of strong flavors. He ate it all up and said he would order it again.  My friend had the  bouillabaisse, which I loved, except she ordered a spicy level 8 which I couldn't handle. She even regretted it too, saying the temperature heat and spicy heat was more than she is typically use to.  My advice for this place: (1) come at least 2 hours before prime lunch or dinner times start. Your wait might only be an hour - an hour and one half (I arrived at10:30am, and was seated at 11:45am); (2) try not to come with a large group (4-5 max) because with only a few seats at the bar, it will take a while for a large group to be seated; (3) be careful not to order your soups with more than a level 5 spice (they use red cracked pepper and habeneros as their spices), and (4) don't waste your time or money on their oysters.  Overall great food and service. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Much like Lianna N., my BFF, I too would have given Oyster Bar a 3.5 the night we ate it, maybe a 3 because we waited for 2.5 hours and I stood there in my heels seething at the people taking over an hour to eat. But here I am 5 days later and OMG I want it again.  I'm not sure what it is, maybe its the fact that I waited so long and the idea of waiting so long again makes it that much more elusive (and the fact that its in Vegas and I live far away), or maybe its because I am no longer exhausted, but it makes me want to go back to vegas so I can appreciate it more.    I got the combo pan roast and the seafood portions in it were very generous. None of those tiny bay shrimps and mini lobster morsels that are the size of your finger nail that come in lobster bisque. These were large shrimps, and larger pieces of lobster. But the real star, was the crab.  Shockingly, the fact that the seafood sits boiling and bubbling for 15+ minutes does not make it tough and rubbery.  The lobster remained soft and the crab was even softer.  I got it with a spicy level 4, but I think i could do the 5.  It was creamy, slightly spicy, and pretty flavorful.   5 days later I think I am willing to wait the 2.5 hours again, just not when its 2 in the morning and I'm starting to hang.",

    "text": "What the oyster!  The name of this place is actually misleading because personally I did not enjoy the raw oysters much and did not see that many people ordering it, but the crazy good food here MORE than made up for the lackluster oysters!  I've had pan roast before but was honestly was never a fan. When my Las Vegas date suggested this place, I kind of made a scrunchy face but said yes and boy am I glad I did!    Two words can sum up this review:  PAN ROAST.   Get the pan roast. I got a level 6 spicy which was perfect.  It was creamy, flavorful and packed full of rich seafood ingredients. It was so heavy and delicious that I had to sleep sitting up for the remainder of the night. We also tried half dozen raw oysters which were not horrible but not great, so I suggest just skipping it, and also the cioppino which wasn't memorable either. The seafood in the cioppino was definitely fresh but overall, it was bit heavy on the tomato base for my liking.   One thing I liked was that they cooked the food right in front of you so you could see all of the hard work, sweat, love, and seafood that goes into your food.   Beware of the wait though.  We took a cab to Palace Station around 11:30pm and waited for about two hours to be seated. It's a small place, bar seating in the middle of the casino and accommodates only 18 lucky folks at a time... which means you have to put in your time and wait. By the time we finished, it was 3am and I was delirious but deliriously stuffed with pan roast.   Conclusion:  Totally worth it.",

They served used bread with butter. We ordered a dozen of oysters for $20! The oysters took about 40 minutes to come out, they were good and I liked their cocktail sauce. After the oysters we waited a very long time for our pan roast shrimp, and combo. The pan roasts come with a scoop of rice which was delicious, I got my heat level at 4 which was perfect.

    "text": "Holy crap this restaurant has blessed my soul. Disclaimer: I have a long review coming up so if the first sentence wasn't enough to convince you to try this place out, here's some more reasons.   Service: My first impression of this place was horrible. When we got to the bar and saw that there was only countertop seating with 15 seats, we asked the chef, Ricardo, what we could do because my dad is in a wheelchair. The bar was full and he was busy so his attitude came off a bit arrogant and careless. However, he and the waitress opened up the restaurant right behind the bar for us to sit at within 5 minutes. It was honestly the sweetest thing and nice to have an empty restaurant to ourselves. Then, he even came by to suggest us different items and let us sample the different soups! The service here is top notch.   Oysters: I love oysters. I've had them at buffets, at nice restaurants, and in different states but I've never seen such fat and fresh oysters! We ordered 3 dozen and they consistently stayed that way! Not a single bad, small, or old oyster. Soo worth the money, so delicious, and so satisfying.   Soups: We tried the Manhattan, the New Zealand, and the special mix of the 2, the dirty New Jersey (lol, that's what the chef named it). They were all delicious!! Everyone at the table loved each one. Also, I highly, highly recommend the combo pan roast. I overlooked it on the menu but after the chef brought out a sample, I regretted not ordering it. I loved that all the soups were so light and not thick at all.   Mussels: The mussels were not as great as the oysters/soups and were pretty standard but worth the price if you love mussels!  Shrimp & Clam Linguine: The portion is pretty big and it was a great selection.   Bread: The complimentary bread sucked and was hard as Legos but I didn't give a rat's ass about it because all the other food was so great.   This place is not located in a hotel on the strip but it's only like a 12 minute drive! Also, don't expect the hotel to be modern chic or anything upscale. But again, who cares when the food and service is great. The bar itself is trendy and looks super classy.   This place definitely lives up to the hype.",

I would have liked a little more seafood in it though. I found a couple pieces of lobster and shrimp here and there. There was no wait. We got here at 5 pm on a Thursday to a half full bar. The chef and waitress were very nice. The chef was very talkative and liked interacting with patrons which in my book is a plus. Loved the food but maybe with a little less salt. Def will return.

Putting ambiance aside, you'll have to look beyond the grungy carpet, stale smoke smell and outdated design of the Palace Station and it'll be well worth it. Avoid peak dinner hours (7-8:30pm) or be prepared to wait in line. We waited 1.5 hrs and another 20 mins while our gumbo and pan roast dishes were made. Note that there are only 18 bar stools and an average diner will take 30-40 mins. to eat plus the time you'll wait in line. It is definitely worth the wait though and a great experience watching the chef work making the specialties! Dishes are huge and sharing is permitted but worth the $5 split fee.",

And I'm glad we did.  It is such a small bar with long wait times. Fortunately, we lucked out- the group in front of us couldn't wait any longer and left.  So we waited about 5 minutes and we were seated.  The pan roast combo is what we decided to order and share - there's an additional charge for that by the way.  But we didn't mind.  While waiting, we had oyster shooters in vodka and tequila.  It was fresh, flavorful and quite refreshing.  We watched the chef make the dish - there was so much  ingredients and it looked so laborious. You see him adding and mixing and seasoning several steel pots- which probably contains different types of pan roasts. Only when we started eating did we realize that each ingredient he added at just the right time created such a complex and tasty broth - if you can call it that, to our dish.  It was so finger-lickin' good that my friend was tempted to lick the bowl.  I only wish there was more seafood and more broth - well, I really should have ordered my own.  It is a definite must-try.",

I guess after seeing the wait times during the day, an after midnight meal actually seems like a pretty good idea :P   We ordered the lobster pan roast, Alaskan white clam chowder, and clam linguini. They were all delicious, but I do have to say the pan roast was my favorite. Every dish is flavorful and very generous with the proportions of seafood they have! You pick your level of spice, and since I usually go with mild I went with a 3 which was perfect for me. My friend chose 5 for his Alaskan chowder, and you can definitely already taste the kick!   I love how we are able to see everything being prepped, and the staff is so friendly and personable. I never thought of myself as one to like oysters, until the chef gave me one to try and I couldn't believe how delicious it was!  Definitely a delicious way to start this Vegas trip. Would definitely recommend :)",

She even came to pick me up from my hotel to bring me to dine here. I was a little hesitant because the hotel was on the older side and the inside wasn't much to look at but trust me, you need to come here!!  The restaurant isn't large and is only counter seating. It's limited on seats and usually there is a line. People around me told me that they have waited up to a little more than 3 hours before just to dine here. Luckily we came on a weekday and the wait was a little more than an hour. You receive great service from everyone here and they strive to give you an amazing meal. It's also fun watching them prepare your order in front of you.  We ordered a dozen Oysters on Half Shell, half a dozen Clams in Half Shell, Combo Pan Roast with extra Clams (spice level 10), House Gumbo with extra Lobster (spice level 10) and white rice for everyone. Everything was delicious!! Spice level was just ok so they made us their special Lava Sauce. It added flavor and a little more kick to their dishes. I washed down the meal with a Voodoo Mary. It was very tasty and came with a giant shrimp!   Everything is good here and I cannot wait to come back. Must try spot in Vegas!",

While we waited, we played some slots. So the wait wasn't that bad, and it was definitely worth it.  Located in the middle of the casino floor at the Palace Station, it's actually set up like a bar. You watch the chef multitask between 6 pots to create his delicious concoctions and his assistants help take your order, buss eating areas, and keep the water coming.  They have 5 different kinds of Pan Roast - shrimp, lobster, crab, combo, and the \"Palace\". It's ONLY a $3 difference to get shrimp, lobster, AND crab in your Pan Roast. So unless you have an allergy or you hate any of those ingredients, I would recommend either the combo or the \"Palace\". The \"Palace\" is basically the combo with added sausage - but same price as the combo. You also need to pick a spicy level that you're comfortable with from 1-10 - they're not kidding about their spice after level 7.  It's served HOT with a helping of rice. You probably won't be able to finish the entire thing unless you're STARVING. But they'll pack it up nice and tight for you to take home when you don't finish it. And it's still amazing the day after out of the microwave. Amazing...  I've never had anything like it, and it might become a regular stop every time I go to Vegas. I just wish they had something like this in SF...",

While neither of us proclaim to be experts, we've both certainly eaten tons of oysters. The blue points we were served appeared to have been soaked in fresh water. Fine for clams but a disaster for oysters. All the brine was gone, nice fresh oysters tasted of absolutely nothing. Plus the muscle wasn't cut all the way through and no oysters forks were provided. These people know utterly nothing about oysters. Another total waste of money.   \"Maryland\" crab cakes: Nothing what-so-ever to do with Maryland crab cakes. These are southern style, 90% filler with a few bits of shredded crab. Under cooked and limpy. These people know utterly nothing about crab cakes as well. Another total waste of money.   Shrimp tacos: Do it. Nice flavors, cooked right.   From our experience, the Oyster Bar appears to be a decent Mexican restaurant but a terrible seafood restaurant.",

    "text": "Omg!!! I have been sleeping on this place. Tucked away in Palace station is this place that is literally a bar so be ready to wait a little while because there isn't much seating. We got lucky that there wasn't much of a line but we may have waited about 40 minutes with only 4 people in front of us. But let me tell you! It is so worth the wait! I was hesitant to go because I don't eat seafood but they had chicken gumbo that was beyond delicious! And the portion size is humongous! 3 people can easily share one bowl of gumbo. You also choose your spice level. I did a seven and for someone who likes it really hot, this was REALLY hot! But the flavor was amazing! Next time I'll do a level 4 or 5. The sourdough roll just tops off the experience. I will be back real soon!",

    "text": "This is a 24 hour hole in the wall seafood bar located in the Palace Station Casino, though all Station Casinos have one. I was told this one is the best!  This is a small bar with less than 20 seats. They do not take reservations, so you stand in line and when enough seats open up your party can sit down. The chef and bartenders do monitor the line.   There were four people in my party and we all ordered the combination pan roast. When I heard \"pan roast\" I was not really expecting a soup like entree. It's very similar to a gumbo, but creamy and had lobster, crab and shrimp. White rice served on the side. It was absolutely delicious! The bowl was so big that I couldn't finish it.   Bob, the chef who has worked there for around 20 years prepares everything to order and will ask your spice preference from 1-10. 5 is a good medium!  They offer other selections such as pasta, traditional gumbo and of course oysters.   Because of the limited seating, it gets very busy and can have a long line. We arrived at 10:00AM hoping to avoid a line, no such luck. We still waited about 30 minutes. They say their only slow time is from 2AM-10AM so plan accordingly.   Check out Oyster Bar at Palace Station next time you are in Las Vegas!   Enjoy!",

An in you face,  seafood merger of a velvety dark rue, shrimp, crab, lobster and the  THREE KEY INGREDIENTS....sausage and okra and DRY SPICES.... that produce a flavor that is not found anywhere in the USA. Caution...if you are not a seasoned spice lover, order your gumbo 5 or below. If you are into real HEAT... order 7-10. It's open 7 days...24 hours...Wednesday thru Sunday expect a wait between 10 AM - 1 AM ...1-3 people give you the best chance to be promptly seated. NO MINORS...NO RESERVATIONS. You will be sitting at a 16 seat bar....it's a unique experience, and well worth  it !!!   PS ... The beautiful raw oysters, served on ice with  cocktail sauce and horseradish...don't take a back seat to anyone's!",

    "text": "\"The strongest of all warriors are these two- Time and Patience.\" - Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace  To wait in line for Oyster Bar definitely requires a few hours of time and an abundance of patience, but the reward is unreal. My group of six arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday since one of us had been here before and assured us that the food was to die for. We spent an hour in line before being seated in two groups of three at the bar. While we waited we were a little irritated by the cigarette smoke in the casino but found that this line of people were some of the most friendly and veteran that Las Vegas had to offer. Many of the other guests in line had been coming to Oyster Bar for years and were still coming back, so I knew that there must be light at the end of this tunnel!   After being seated, we were given great service by the waitress who was very attentive and made sure we always had full water cups. My friends and I ordered the combo pan roast and I opted for a level 2 spiciness because I'm a wimp. In hindsight, I probably could've gone up to a 4 for a little bit of a kick because at a 2 I didn't notice any heat. The food is made in front of you in a row of kettles and it's neat watching the chef orchestrate the various orders and keep the line moving at a good pace. When our plates finally came out, about an hour after we were seated, it was love at first slurp! There were plenty of chunks of lobster and shrimp and the creamy tomato base has so much flavor. The bowl was huge and I tried my hardest to eat as much as I could of the liquid goodness, but I was left with more than half of my order which I happily packed to go.   In all, I'm so happy to have discovered this place and will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas. The time from arrival to departure with my leftovers was 2.5 hours, which seems to be on the faster side than other reviewers but I believe that it's completely worth the wait. So tough it out and with a little patience and you shall be rewarded!",

Don't get me wrong, it was good. Their signature pan roast was solid, and it had generous amounts of shrimp, lobster, and crab. It tasted like a more \"tomato-y\" version of a Tikka Masala. The soup itself is pretty heavy. At times, it feels like you're souping on straight up butter. Expect to KTFO after eating this. The combination gumbo was the highlight for me and just a very well rounded dish. The okra added an element of earthiness to it, and the Andouille sausage enhanced the heat and flavor. It also had plenty of seafood in it. We also tried raw clams on the shell for the first time (besides having it as Mirugai sushi before). However, I had to dose it in cocktail sauce, horseradish, and Tabasco, because it was way too fishy for my enjoyment.   Overall, it was good, but it's crazy that people wait in line for hours for this stuff. I guess that makes us crazy, but I don't think we will put ourselves through getting roasted by that line again for that pan roast. If we're ever up and awake at 2 am on a Tuesday, maybe then we'll decide to come back.",

Hubby's and my trip was all plan because we really wanted to go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant, but next trip The Oyster Bar will be included as part of it since we found this gem.  We were in Vegas for 3 days and for two of our dinners you could find us at The Oyster Bar. You have read about the line and yes it is real! Our first night going there we waited in line for one hour and the second time we waited for two hours. The bar sits about 20-25 people I believe. It does take same time because every single dish is made to order by their amazing Chef's who are talented and are their own characters. If you get the chance make sure you do say \"hi\" and talk to the Chef.   What we order: - Pan Roast - Bouillabaisse - Alaskan Clam Chowder  Pan Roast is AMAZING! It's creamy and every single spoon is full of flavor and crab! For spice level we got a 3, which is not that spicy at all, but I eat spicy food all the time. Chef Eze noticed that I can handled spicy so he went ahead and gave me a side of their Lava sauce which is really good and spicy.   Bouillabaisse is, also, really good. Lots of seafood and veggies. Would I get it again? Yes, I would but it would not be my first choice!  Alaskan Clam Chowder!!! Yummsss! This is the best clam chowder hubby and I have ever had. He said that he even liked it more than the Pan Roast.   All in all, if you are going to Vegas the same way you have to visit the strip, it's the same way you HAVE TO visit The Oyster Bar. Just make sure you plan accordingly for the 1-2 hour wait in a standing line and you're good. There is machines around so if you go with someone take turns and go play.",

At $24 a bowl I'd say it's the best bang for your buck as long as you like a variety of seafood. We also ordered the fresh oysters on a half shell, which they have shipped in from Louisiana! They were very fresh and delicious.

It's open 24 hr so plan accordingly and don't make my mistake.   After a pain staking 3 hours in a smokey hotel casino, we got seated at the 18 seat oyster bar. At this point, I was hangry, sleepy and pretty over it. But as I sat there, stuffing my face with bread and butter and drinking my ice cold Pepsi, the smell of the food lifted my spirits.   We started with oysters, which were a pretty good size. I watched as the chef stirred my pan roast and chowder and started drooling. My bf and I ordered the combo pan roast and the Alaskan chowder dirty style. First bite of steaming hot chowder and all my frustrations washed away. It was f**king amazing!!   The chowder was filled with seafood and two pieces of beautifully cooked lobster. Dirty style is the way to goo!! The combo pan roast was delicious!! We savored each bite, while dipping our bread and finished the entire bowl.   A lot of people took theirs to go, because honestly it's a large portion, but we didn't have a microwave in our room so we finished it.   Yes, the wait is long but was it worth it?

(Also another thing to note is that I'm not a huge fan of oysters but they have a pretty nice deal for oysters so you should most definitely check them out if you love oysters I guess.)  I just haven't had a place in SoCal that compares to this place. I've searched and they don't have the flavors that compare to Las Vegas. There were places that came pretty close but it's just never good enough. This is located in Palace Station and it's open late. I was surprised to see that there was a line just for this place. (It's located inside the casino.) There isn't a lot of seating but I feel that's what makes this place so desirable. The wait is worth it. I would say there's about roughly 15 chairs? They have just stools and you sit around the chefs like you're at a bar. You can watch them prepare your food so that's always entertaining.  Overall it was a great experience. I enjoy this place a lot and I'm glad I was introduced.  TL;DR Pan roast was my favorite. Bouillabaisse is good. Great oyster deals.",

    "text": "My wife and I waited about two hours to get seats at The Oyster Bar after hearing such high praises about the food. We had Oysters and the Combo Pan Roast. The oysters were good: large and meaty and paired well with the bar's cocktail and horseradish sauce. The Combo Pan Roast is the bar's specialty; this is a rich creamy flavorful stew filled with fresh and tender shrimp, crab, and lobster. The optional spiciness of the stew makes the dish even better. Overall, good food but I probably wouldn't wait 2 hours for a seat.",

    "text": "I was taking my seafood-loving family to Vegas for the first time, and The Oyster Bar was on the list. The verdict? The food and service were good, but the wait was horrible.   We got in line around 10:30 or so on a Tuesday morning. The reality didn't sink in for me from reading the reviews until I got there. There are ONLY around 20 seats at the bar. That means two families of four (8), two groups of 3 friends (6), and 3 couples (6) would make up a full bar. Plus, people are not there to eat and go; they enjoy food and that takes time. There were around 3 groups ahead of us, but it took over 1.5-2 hours for us to finally sit down at the bar.  Tip: If the line goes past the first slot machine around the corner, you're waiting 2 hours or more. TIP: Do not come here hungry.  - Oysters on the Half Shell - 4/5 - This was good. However, after waiting for so long, I just wanted warm food at this point, so it didn't hit the spot for me.  - Bouillabaisse - 5/5 - This seafood stew was a favorite. The flavor was just right and the stew was perfect over rice. There were big pieces of shrimp, crab, lobster, cod, mussels, and clams to enjoy.  - Cajun Bbq Peel & Eat Shrimp - 5/5 - Definitely get this if you're here. The shrimps were big and tasty. The sauce that it comes with is amazing with rice.   Overall, the food was good, but it's not worth the wait. I could have spent that time showing my family around Vegas instead. There are many other restaurants where you can get comparable food with a shorter wait time.  Edit: It would be great if they can open a restaurant! More people would love to enjoy their food and the wait would hopefully be shortened.",

The place is located inside Palace Station Hotel and it's literally a bar with about 15 seats at the most? The cook the food right in front of you and the service is fast and friendly. We had the oysters and gumbo. The oysters were the best I've ever had and tasted super fresh. The gumbo was amazing. It's big enough for two to eat and was filled with tons of seafood.  We were lucky enough to not have to wait long but when we left there was about 10 people in line. I recommend going during non busy hours. Definitely a must try!",

    "text": "I weigh my five stars heavily. And this is one of the few that I think that fully deserves it. From everything including service, food, and atmosphere, I have no doubt in my mind it is a place that I will remember and revisit whenever I can.  The day I went was in New Year's Eve, about two hours before the ball dropped, so there wasn't much of a line. I've heard an excess of 2.5 hours worth of wait was normal, but we waited at most an hour and fifteen minutes. Time also flew by in the presence of great company.  Now on to the food. Like with most southern cuisines, bread and butter as an appetizer was complimentary. It had a sourdough-like flavor to it, which wouldn't have been my first choice of favorite breads, but I can tell it was well made.   My party started with two oysters a person. It was one of the most neutral variants I've tasted in oysters. No metallic or brined taste. Just plump and fresh, served with a generous helping of horseradish, cocktail sauce, and lemons. If so desired, Tabasco and other spices are available.  Next, we had the littleneck clams, steamed in a wonderful buttery white wine sauce, and lightly aromatized with herbal flavors, which really brought the starter off to another level. Save some bread and dip it in there if you're getting this dish.   And for the main course: the bouill-roast. With most roasts or stews, flavors are usually dominated by the spices and the weight of the soup. However, for Oyster Bar's take on the dish, each ingredient can be differentiated easily. On the nose, it had an overwhelming sweet seafood flavor, so good that I didn't want to forget it. The crab had a fresh floral sweet flavor, one that honestly I do not think can be easily surpassed. Each protein was perfectly timed in the roast. The lobster, shrimp, crab, and fish had perfect mouth feel - soft enough where it was easy to eat, and hard enough that you can appreciate each nerve ending on all your teeth that contact the food. Where ribs are judged by how well they fall off the bone, this dish was like everything just fell off the shell.   Serious perfection. If you're ever in the area, you have to try it. Even if it was a three hour wait for me, I would say it would be worth it, and I would maybe only say that for a handful of the hundreds of places I've tried around the world.",

I arrived at 11:30AM on a Monday morning and waited about 5 minutes to be seated. Ordered the house pan roast with a dozen oysters. The pan roast was delicious, but I wish I had opted to add sausage since the lobster got a little overwhelming for me. The oysters were fresh and huge, but lacked flavor so I would recommend trying half a dozen first to see if you like it.   Overall good place to eat, but I wouldn't wait any more than 20 minutes.",

Things you should know: there's always a wait. Doesn't matter if it's 5am or 11pm or anything in between.  If you happen to roll in as a single, you might get lucky, but we waited about 1 hour and 10 min.    We've been here 3 times before, and I've only ever ordered 1 thing. If it ain't broke, let's not fix it, so I order the same thing again. Bouill-Roast.  It's a mix between a bouillabaisse and a pan roast. It has almost every seafood you can think of--lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, and fish. It's a great item to get if you don't know what you want because it has so many different types of seafood. I'll even add some sausage to kick it up another notch.   For my 2nd time here I changed it up and got some oysters to start and a pan roast with just lobster (and  added sausage again).   This place is open 24 hours and located inside the Palace Station casino, which is also awesome.   If you try this place and don't like it, you probably did a something wrong.",

Maybe, maybe not. The oyster bar is an actual a bar with bar seating, not a restaurant. That's why there's always a long line because you're just waiting for someone to give up their seat. I felt like this place was a little understaffed and they could've used one more person.  I ordered the half dozen gold band oysters and the combo pan roast. I was told by our server that the oysters came from Louisiana. They were pretty huge and meaty, but I thought they tasted really fishy and weren't the best (and I've tried many). I shared the pan roast with my friend and it was enough to feed 2 petite girls. We ordered level 5 spicy (scale of 1-10) and the heat was right in the middle. This comes with a small bowl of rice and it was very flavorful and filling, but I thought it was a bit watery and not as creamy as I would've liked. I overheard someone next to us order another bowl of rice for $2.99. They are going to charge that much for an extra bowl of rice?! Get out of here, rice doesn't cost much. Besides all that I had mentioned, the staff was very friendly and service was great.",

Wait time: Although the wait was approximately 1 hour 20 minutes (we got in line at the ATM machine for those that want a marker of where we started), it was worth the wait. Even my mom, who hates to wait, was impressed by the food and said the wait was worth it. Wait depends on the sizes of the parties. You can't tell because most people leave to gamble while one person in the party waits in line. They will take you by the order you are in line. Even for take out, you must stand in line. Even if there's a couple empty seats, they try to wait it out for the next party to be able to fit.   Combo pan roast: Definitely recommended! Thick creamy soup type dish with shrimp, real crab meat, and lobster similar to etouffee. Eat it with rice. If you saved your bread roll (hard to save when you're hungry and been waiting for a while), you can eat with this soup. Spiciness can range from 1 to 10. We got 5 and 7. Major difference in spiciness. 7 was pretty spicy and I can take the heat. 5 was very mild for me. My husband got a 5 and took some from my bowl because the spicy flavor made it tastier. Bowls come big. Share if you're not that hungry or don't eat much.   Oysters: Fresh and big! So delicious! We got half a dozen but I wanted more.   Oyster shooter with vodka: Whoa! When in Vegas... this was serious alcohol. I couldn't take it in one shot because they filled a large shot glass. I would try it with tequila next time.   Customer service: Everyone was so polite and helpful! They are busy, but they're willing to help when you ask. The main chef is busy but was willing to photo bomb a couple taking pics. Ha!",

At first my husband I split one but the next couple of times we ended up ordering our own and saving the rest for later. I think the portion is pretty large.  Maybe others might not feel the same.   Can't wait to stay there @ Palace Station next month just so that it's readily available whenever we decide to go. haha priorities",

Yup, so if you have minors like I did, leave them at home or do something with them. They won't even seat you. Dumbest rule I've ever heard. Simple advice to management: Card the individual whose ordering the liquor.",

We had the Palace pan roast which is a creamy tomato stew with lots of shrimp, crab,lobsters and andouille sausage (local favorite). We also had the clam fettuccine with more clams than noodles. The sauce was a perfect white creamy sauce. Raw oysters were also a hit. We ordered 5 dozen oyster from Louisiana. All the foods were cooked in front of us as we ate the oysters. This is the spot if you love seafood  #Bongsworld",

From the pictures the oyster look good and BIG.... I decided to give this place a try. When we got there there was a long line even this late at night. So we waited about an hour (get your self a drink or two while you wait) it's is literally a bar so they can only fit so many people but it's worth the wait.   We were finally seated, I got the 3 oyster shooters to start with mezcal mix, then ordered the 1/2 dozen of oysters. The oysters are big and meaty. They also were cooking food that had been order from others I. Front of us and there sea food selection is very good! Will definitely come back again.",

The name tags of the staff at Palace Station say they love locals, and it seemed like most of the folks in the 18 seats were locals. The locals sitting next to us said a certain chef should be avoided, but everything we had was delicious.   I would recommend the Bouillabaisse and add the lobster. That's what Josie had and it was simply wonderful. My Palace Station pan fry was good, but not like the Bouillabaisse!  Be prepared to stand in line for at a minimum of 15 minutes - it's literally a bar with 18 seats as others have noted. You'll stand in an open line right next to bar and they don't rush anyone, so relax!",

    "text": "We had to abort our first attempt at eating at Oyster Bar due to the line and my hungry wife. We tried but the line was not really moving too quick. We figured that 10am on a Monday would be better and it was. The line was shorter, only 2 people ahead of us, and we were seated in about 5-10 minutes. It's pretty crazy that there is a line always, but they only have like 12-14 seats around a bar type area. They mentioned that some renovations were going to be done soon. Hopefully that means expansion with some more seating.   We decided to start off with some raw oysters. These were probably the biggest and meatiest oysters that we have ever had. I think that it took the guy 20 seconds to open 12 oysters. Impressive! The wife has a lobster allergy, so it's always a little Russian roulette like ordering seafood, especially at a place where they serve lobster. At least they cook everything in front of you so you can keep an eye out on them. The wife decides on the cioppino since it has no lobster. I opted for the etouffee and told the guy to leave out the lobster. No problem, as all the dishes are prepared to order. For spice levels, the wife chose a 6/10, and I went with 9/10. I shy away from 10/10 just in case the chef kicks it up an extra notch. The spice level on mine was just right, plenty of heat but no residual effects the next day if you know what I mean. Portion sizes are generous here and if you can agree on a dish and spice level, you could easily split any of the main bowl dishes. See the pictures for portion size.   Great meal and worth maybe a 30 minute wait, more than that might me pushing it. I guess that you can get in line before you are hungry and maybe your timing will be perfect for your appetite to peak as you are seated.",

We came during the odd hours of the night (3am) after we left the club and was surprised to find people still waiting in line. Can't imagine how long the wait would be during the day or even dinner time but we ended up waiting at least an hour still before being seated.   So...was the wait really worth it?? You betcha!!! If you can stand long lines, you seriously won't be disappointed!  Must order items:  - Clam Chowder : soooo yummy and creamy and filled with lots of clams!   - Palace Pan Roast: OMG...my mouth waters just thinking about it. I got a level 5 spice and it was perfect! They fill it up with tons of seafood and sausage. The flavoring of the soup broth is freaken amazing!!!   - Jambalaya: the spicier the better!! Best I ever had!!   The portions here are HUGE so get a variety and share so you can try more things! Takes a bit of time to actually get your food since there's only 2 chefs doing everything but you can tell they use all fresh ingredients and everything is made to order. Really enjoyed the Cajun/creole style food here!! Can't wait to come back!",

If your lucky and you come at the right time (preferably after hours) you will not wait too long.  We got the oysters to give us something to munch on while we wait for our entrees. For our entrees we got the Pan Roast and Gumbo.  The Pan roast is made up of lobster, shrimp, and other seafood in a thick, creamy tomato based stew with warm rice. I LOVE how they have levels of spiciness and you can make it as spicy as you want. YEA!  The Gumbo wasn't as good as the Pan Roast. It tasted a little muddy and murky but it had lots of goodies inside like sausages. I won't be ordering the gumbo next time and will stick to the Pan Roast.",

How can this place with limited menu, an insanely long line, cramped bar located within a smoky casino be rated THE best restaurant in Vegas according to Yelp?  I've dined here 3 times now before I felt compelled to write about my informed opinion of this place. Here's what I've encountered all 3 times:  beginning stages of lung cancer while walking through the casino, continuing on with my early stages of lung cancer while waiting in line for 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, jammed into a bar top that seats about 20 people while dining on mediocre food still inhaling the aforementioned smoke.  Service? Mediocre at best, all 3 times. Items are forgotten, timing is off and many workers don't seem happy to be there. The experience is rushed solely because you can constantly sense the stares and anguishing hunger from those waiting in line 5 paces behind you...stalking like wolves; waiting for their prey to fall off their chair in utter gluttony.  The food?  I've had the gumbo twice and the pan roast once. Both were decent, barely bordering on good and I refuse to return again and wait that long in a line for decent food.  Knock my socks off with food and service in a nice atmosphere...maybe worth those waits, but not this place as it currently stands.  All 3 visits I ordered my food mild...all three times the following day was not a good day, stomach-wise. Yes, something is fishy.  Good news for the rest of you who decide to forge ahead with this place; there will be one less sucker waiting in line and taking up your coveted seat at the oyster bar. Enjoy!",

The service was excellent as well. The best service I've had by far in Vegas. The staff are very interactive with their guests, which brings in another level of service to their establishment.

It was really pathetic at first but after a while, we decided to just go with it since we did want to try this place.  THANKFULLY....it did NOT disappoint!!  The food was delectable. You get to choose how spicy you want your food from the scale of 1-10, 1 being not spicy and 10 being very spicy.  We had: - The seafood combo platter (included raw oysters, raw clams, and shrimp cocktail)- delicious & fresh! - I ordered the Pan Roast Combo and it was SOoooooO yummy and pungent in flavor. It came with a scoop of rice in it. I couldn't finish the whole thing because of how heavy it was, but every single bite was heaven. So delicious and creamy.. makes me think differently of the typical \"lobster bisque now\".. this one is like a lobster bisque but. with LOTS OF crab meat chunks, shrimps and all the other seafood in it..... I HIGHLY recommend this dish if you are wondering what to order.  My friend had recommended it and now I get why. ;) - My husband ordered the house Gumbo. He loved it too. I tried a little bit but didn't like it as much since he had ordered it a little bit spicy.  OVERALL I recommend this place..(THUMBS UP!) I still haven't decided if we'll be back since the wait can be a burden..But we will see. :)",

The cooks and servers have an aire about them as if you are fortunate to be in their presence.  This place needs a complete overhaul, and maybe someone from Louisiana to show them the proper way to make a roux and stock.",

I had not read any reviews (until now) that mentioned the pan roast but I am oh so glad I tried it. Succulent shrimp, sausage, chicken, and crab (Palace Station Roast but you can choose others) in a greatness that I cannot describe. I can talk about the other aspects of the experience such as the wait but that would take away so much from this place. It was well worth it. Do yourself a  favor and try this place!

    "text": "I loved this place.  The restaurant itself is a long counter in the shape of a half circle that seats about 18 people at a time. It literally opens up out onto the main casino floor. Behind the counter are 6 interesting looking little kettles that are permanently affixed to a pipe where hot steam runs to heat the bottom of each pot. The chefs prepare your order right in front of you in these steam kettles. The whole experience reminded me of a sushi bar.  But before you can sit down at the counter, you have to wait in line. From what I can tell, there's *always* a line during lunch and dinner. The wait can be as long as an hour if you come at peak times. I think it's a telling sign that everybody I stood in line with was a Las Vegas local. They all rave about this place and come here as often as they can manage. The dude in front of me moved to Vegas 10 days ago, came to Palace Station for a job interview, and stopped here to have a salad and clam chowder. Suffice it to say he couldn't wait to come back for a proper meal, and even spent over an hour that evening on a local bus to come back here for dinner. The local couple behind me said that a place like Palace Station didn't deserve a restaurant that made food this good. When you come here, be aware that the seating is first come first serve. So if you have a large group, you may just want to split into smaller groups in order to get seated instead of waiting for an entire row of 6 seats or whatever to open up.  Once you get to the counter, the whole experience is pretty leisurely. What can you expect with up to 18 people to serve and only 6 pots? I ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell to pass the time. These fat little guys were pried open in front of you and served on ice with a red chili sauce and horseradish. Yummy.  As for the entrees, here is the menu:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fallmenus.com%2Fme&s=128e89668ffb3a4a2f4e1794f2d0d066ea1ca04e0d405b7382d890ca0296945c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">allmenus.com/me</a>...  As you can see, most of the dishes are made in a tomato based seafood broth. The Pan Roasts are made with a tomato cream stock, which make them a little heavier. The husband of the local couple I was talking about earlier has been getting the same thing for the past 10 years, so I figured I should try the crab meat pan roast too. The wife swears by the Bouillabaisse, which I'll definitely try next time. If you've ever gone to a restaurant and ordered seafood, got your dish, and wondered where all the seafood went... the Oyster Bar is not one of those places. My bowl was chock full of real crab meat. Every other dish I watched our chef prepare was also laden with seafood.  You can have the spice level made to order too. I had the medium, which I thought was perfect. But for those of you who prefer to breathe fire, that can be arranged too. No Americanization of spice levels here.  My crab pan roast was sooo satisfying. After the stew is poured from the kettle into your big bowl, the chef tops it off with a large scoop of rice to soak up all the goodness. It is truly a perfect dish for a cold winter's night in Vegas. Mouthfuls of Cajun spiced crab with every spoonful. It was heavenly.  Finally, I have to mention the portions. If it weren't for the fact that I hadn't eaten all day, there was no way I could have finished the 6 oysters, the pan roast, and the beer I ordered. Two people could easily share any of the entrees. In fact, I think a dozen oysters, one entree, and drinks is the perfect amount of food for two people.",

Bob does not mess around with the heat scale, if he's cooking, I go as low as a 5. If JJ is cooking, I'll go with a 7. Everything is made to order and the service is great.

I've never had oysters there, but the pan roasts are an absolute must - particularly the Palace pan roast, which has a little bit of everything.  (Protip: The main bar in the casino has 99c margaritas, which you will need several of while waiting. They're considerably larger than the ones at the Fremont downtown, and of better quality.)",

If you have been to Vegas and you weren't fortunate enough to find this place or eat here, then you've missed out on something great at Las Vegas. This place is HANDS DOWN Best restaurant that exists in this town. Every single time I go to Vegas, I always get my fix at the Oyster Bar.   I'm a Gumbo and Jambalaya person. Nope, not when it comes to OYSTER BAR. I get some Fresh Oysters, then some Clams, and then finish it off with the Best Entree : Ciopinno! It comes with Shrimp, Crabs, Lobster, Cod, Mussels, Clams, etc in a Tomato soup with Rice in it.   Crap, I'm drooling just looking at the photos and thinking about it. Yea, it's somewhat pricey, but when it's less than ONE SINGLE BET at a Blackjack table, hell yea it's worth it. Either you can lose $25 bucks at a blackjack table with 1 bet or you can use that money towards a memory you will have for the rest of your life.   You can always get Gumbo and Jambalaya elsewhere, but you won't have Cioppino like the Oyster Bar anywhere else.   Yes, the WAIT is pretty long. One time we had to wait an Hour for it. But you know that anything worth waiting this long that there's a reason for it. Because it's FRICKIN GOOD!   I'm going to Vegas next Monday but I will Definitely be stopping by here yet AGAIN. If you don't try the Cioppino, you're missing out. You can have other dishes, but are you really going to save couple of bucks and get cheaper dishes? This is Vegas. You're blowing hundreds of dollars everywhere else, but this isn't blowing your money. This place is more like investing for some damn good food that you will not regret and forget",

The combo pan roast includes shrimp, crab, and lobster in a tomato based creamy gumbo like stew served with a scoop of rice. It is AMAZING! The portion is huge, big enough for 2 ppl to share. But many people order their own bowl. The jambalaya was pretty good, but I'd rather order another pan roast. You get to choose a spicy level, 1 being the least spicy and 10 being the most. I can't eat anything that's too spicy, a little bit of kimchi, a squirt of sriracha, a dash of tabasco, a tiny bag of flamin' hot Cheetos are just about the best I can do.  I was able to taste the difference in the spicy level between a 3 and a 4, i can't imagine what a 10 would taste like.Their Alaskan chowder looked good too, the person next to us ordered it and I must say it's well worth the wait. We had to wait over an hour for a seat. There are only about 15 or 16 seats at the bar and that's it! So you can imagine how long you'll have to wait. There are only 6 cooking stations too, so order your appetizers and beer to hold you over if you're starving! I know I was after a 4 hr drive from LA! Great place to eat for sure!   I am definitely coming back! I know there's a place in Chino that serves the same thing, the Broiler, I will try there next time.  It's closer to LA than Vegas.",

We always come during the afternoon since it seems that the restaurant is not as busy as it would be at night and they have big screens playing all the sports games for the day so you can eat and watch at the same time.  We always get the same items: Oysters of the day to start off the meal, then the clam chowder, and its usually the Bourbon Jamabalaya or Sauteed clams in white sauce with linguine. There's also complimentary bread that comes with the meal which is great to dip in the clam chowder.   Since we travel in a group, we can order all this food and share but for those that are just traveling with their SO or couple of friends, get half a dozen of oysters, share the clam chowder and you MUST try the jamabalaya! Those three you have to try if you never been to Oyster bar before.",

    "text": "We decided to check this place out on a recent trip to Vegas and I'm so glad we did.  It's now at the top of my list of go-to restaurants and places to eat at when I'm in Vegas.   The oyster bar is very small, maybe only seats about 18-20 people.  It's open 24-7 and we decided to go for lunch on a Saturday during 4th of July weekend.  I thought we would for sure be waiting for at least 45 minutes to an hour when we got there but I was really surprised that they actually had 4 seats available and we went around 11:30am!    We ordered a dozen fresh oysters and the Combo Pan Roast with Rice.  The oysters are the biggest oysters that I've ever seen.  They are huge!  They were really good and fresh since he shucks them for you right there.    We had four people and we each ordered a Combo Pan Roast to split between 2 people.  It was absolutely amazing!!  We ordered a spicy level of 5 which wasn't spicy enough for us.  I love spicy, my husband can take an average spicy and he didn't think 5 was spicy enough so next time we will probably go to order a 7.  The Combo Pan Roast comes with chunks of chicken, sausage and seafood.  It tastes like a creamy tomato stew but filled with spices and yummy goodness.  It's best to mix with rice.  It comes with one serving of rice but if you split it, they charge an extra $5 for a second plate of rice.  The best part of it is that it's not too salty which can be a product of some pan roasts.     I saw a couple order the Clam Chowder which looked amazing and I saw someone else order the gumbo, which looked equally amazing.  Next time, I'm saving up my stomach to order the gumbo as well as going back to get the Pan Roast and then if I have room I will try the Clam Chowder.    When we left around 12:30pm, the line was long and there were a ton of people waiting.  Glad we beat the crowd but I would gladly wait in line any day for this.  It's totally worth it!",

You'll be waiting for hours if you want to seat more than 3 people even if there's empty seats in this shit hole.  Empty seats are left there for 45 mins because no one organizes anything. I used to come here but the poor organization gets in the way of the food. If you're from out of town and you've convinced yourself to wait for ok-ish food, kudos to you. You've bought into the hype of a joint that was never that great. Look at the reviews. Very few are from locals....",

Even at that hour, open seats were quickly filled by a steady stream of Oyster Bar fans. Before we ordered, we chatted with those next of us to scope out what we should get. Ultimately, based on the recommendation of the chef, we settled on sharing their 3 most popular dishes: combo pan roast, gumbo, and the bouillabaisse, listed in my order of preference. These entrees were served in heaping bowls that no mere mortal can finish and the family style approach was the perfect way to enjoy the food. We ordered our food with a spiciness scale of 8 (of 10). I think next time I'm dialing it back to a 6. Each dish was teeming with seafood cooked just right, which surprised me because the dishes were cooking for quite awhile in front of us. The flavor of the pan roast was superb and the standout. We also shared some raw oysters and a cup of dirty chowder (blend of New England and Manhattan). Both were great too.   The quality of the food, the counter seating and being able to observe your food being cooked in front of you makes the Oyster Bar a very unique dining experience. And for a Cajun food lover such as me, this place is simply out of this world!",

It was so good we came back the next day. She ordered the jambalaya and I went with the gumbo. We liked the etouffee the best followed closely by the creamy goodness of the pan roast. Both days we enjoyed a dozen oysters so fresh you can taste the ocean.   The chef had good banter going with the folks sitting at counter. It was interesting watching the food being made on the steam powered pots (?).   We got there around 11:00 am per one review to avoid the crowd and had minimal wait time. This place is definitely a hidden gem of sorts. Very worthy of a precious meal slot on a trip to Vegas.",

I asked the guy cooking and he said 5 is medium, 3 is mild. 7 was was perfect for me, i love spicy food. The person next to me had a level 10 and let me try a bit, you can definitely taste the spiciness right away and i was able to handle easily, but i don't think i could eat a whole bowl of it. My wife got the Cioppino and added pasta to eat, level  5. Level 5 was too for her and she had a hard time finishing it. If you don't like seafood, I would still recommend coming here, none of the dishes had a seafood taste. The spices they used got rid of the seafood taste.

    "text": "who would of ever thought you could find an amazing oyster bar off the strip in an old ghetto-ish hotel??  I heard the wait is always extremely long, given there are only about 24 seats at the bar.  We were lucky to snag 3 seats and only waited about 20-30 minutes, however the wait was pretty horrible.  Someone had some terrible b.o. going on and we were all hung over from the night before. I will say that  fresh oysters, pan roast, and bouillabaisse are the perfect cure.  I love how you get to see the chef prepare all the food from the first step to the last, all the while your mouth is watering and hoping that he'd finally pour the steamy goodness into your bowl and bring it right over piping hot.  Both stews were filled with shrimp, clams, mussels, king crab legs, and white fish and the broth was delicious.   The pan handle broth is quite thick and creamy, so if you prefer something more soupy, I'd go for the bouillabaisse or the cioppino.     I'm pretty sure the Oyster Bar is the moneymaker for Palace Station...  w h a t   i   d i g  super awesome cookware appliances that allow for easy-pour-into-bowl. done datta!",

    "text": "I'd heard a lot about this spot, so my expectations were very high.  I'm happy to say that Oyster Bar exceeded my expectations.  I started out with a half dozen oysters on the half shell, and was surprised to see the chef shucking the oysters himself.  The oysters were solid, and the horseradish brought tears to my eyes.  Very good.  Now it was time for the main event, Combo Pan Roast at level six spiciness.  They cook it right in front of you and pour it into a huge bowl.  Then they add a scoop of rice and give you a BIG FUCKING JETHRO BODINE-SIZED SPOON.  It was way too much food for one person.  I knew I would be uncomfortable if I ate it all.  But I didn't care.  It was that good.  When I got the bill, I saw that they jammed me $8 for a beer where you get to keep the stupid beer glass.  Like my life would not be complete without a Palace Station beer glass.  Normally this would make me a bit grumpy, but I was so pleased with the food that I didn't even care.  MEMO TO SELF: don't order the 23 oz beer next time  It's well worth the drive (or cab ride) over to the relatively dumpy Palace Station casino for the food at the Oyster Bar.  I cannot recommend it more highly.  I've been back here several times and the food has been wonderful every time.  Ricardo still remembers me after all this time.  He has a great memory...or maybe there aren't many customers wearing shorts in January who consume a combo pan roast, 6 oysters, 3 beers, and a bloody mary in a single visit.  ;)",

    "text": "First rate, and if you're accustomed to being ripped off by the restaurants on the strip, you will be delighted by the prices here.... We started off with a dozen Louisiana oysters. As a New Englander, I'd say these oysters were humongous, but southerners might not agree. Fresh, delicious, and at $20 a dozen - a great bargain. My only issue was that they had almost no liquor. The shells were almost flat, leaving very little room for that luscious oyster brine. I wondered if perhaps the oysters were being served on the wrong half of the shell (if so, I'd definitely knock off a star for that) but since I'm not sure I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.... Followed the oysters with a \"cup\" of the New England clam chowder. I say cup because it's called a cup, but it's actually a small bowl. It's not in the same league as Legal Seafood's clam chowder but it was quite respectable, if a bit on the heavy side. Four stars on the chowda.... On to the main course - the combo pan roast with shrimp, crab, and lobster. This was a stand out dish, rich, creamy, and scrumptious. The waitress asked how spicy I wanted it on a scale from 1-10. I am a spicy food wuss so I said \"1\". I could still detect some heat but I probably should have asked for a \"2\". The \"1\" was on par with a moderate dose of black pepper. My husband ordered a \"6\" on his Palace pan roast (no lobster plus andouille sausage and chicken). I tasted it and it wasn't killer hot, though I probably wouldn't have been able to handle more than 4 or 5 bites. He's got a good tolerance for heat and had no trouble with it though he was blowing his nose by the end of the meal. I'm guessing that a \"10\" would pack serious heat, so proceed with caution.... Oh, and did I mention the portions? We could have easily split an entree. As it is, my mouth is watering  for the leftovers.... Tiny joint so be prepared to wait. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "This is a total hole in the wall, off the radar, random, Oyster Bar/Seafood eatery.  However from the entertaining 'cooking show,' and the deliciously made-to-order dishes, this place is as good as it gets and is definitely some good eats! I'd like to thank my boyfriend for introducing me to this place who in turn learned about this place from a buddy of his with which the word of mouth chain goes further and further back.  We've been here multiple times since my first visit and have enjoyed our meals each time.  Located inside Palace Station Hotel/Casino, thiis hotel is off the strip so get on the 15 North (if you're coming from the strip) and exit Sahara to make a left.  You'll see the hotel on your left as you exit. This is a classic example of how looks can be deceiving.  This hotel is geared towards an older and more local crowd and its very apparent as you take in the exterior of the building (outdated and small) and the interior of the building (outdated and small).   The times that we've made plans to eat here, we've gone super early....often the first ones waiting in line for them to open in order to guarantee that our large party will be seated without a problem. During my first visit we had a group of 8 and since the rest of the group was in the know, they advised we get there even before the place opened. ****This eater is set up like an actual bar with bar seating.  Seating here is extremely limited with no more than 20 people being served at  at  time.****   Once you're lucky enough to grab a coveted seat, sit back to enjoy the show and the food.  With regards to 'the show' the chefs make your dish right before your eyes and this isn't your typical 'boil some water throw in some ingredients and seasonings in a pot on a stove.' Instead there are unique contraptions all around the bar  (I can't even begin to explain what the set up is like).  However, its these unique contraptions that somehow transform simple ingredients into a rustic meal that is both satisfying and HUGE.  Its quite a show when the chef(s) are cooking away, adding ingredients and spices, using all of these contraptions at the same time.  The roasts are presented to you in enormous white bowls and a large spoon to dig right in and enjoy. Each time I've gone, I always think I can finish the entire bowl but it never quite ends up happening...probably due to the side of bread they also give you to sop up the delicious stew.    When me and the boyfriend go, he orders either the shrimp roast OR the combo roast (includes lobster, shrimp, and crab) with pasta. I've also had the shrimp and combo roasts but with rice (I'm Filipino so I need my daily fix of rice!) and I've also tried the house gumbo.  I've already set my eye on trying the cioppino and bouillabaisse dishes for future visits.  Even if we come with a large party, the server is really good about asking if we'd like the bill all on one tab or split among different groups within our party.  The dishes are relatively cheap considering the quality of the food is undeniably fresh and tasty.   A definite 'must try' while in Vegas!",

Worst customer service ever equals no business earned",

It was 5pm and out of the 12 or so space on the bar, there were maybe 4 people there so they could've totally sat us and fed us before things get busy.  Such bad customer service!!!!!!!",

I will say after you are in the glitz and glamour of the strip the outside of the Palace Station will have you second guessing your decision to come there. I actually decided to go during a dog show which made it even more interesting. I was told that there would be a wait but it was worth it. After standing in line for almost an hour and a half I will say that the gumbo i had was one of the best gumbos i have ever tasted. I have friends from New Orleans and this topped theirs. The oysters i had were steamed just right. Horseradish sauce had just the right twang to it. If you have a car in Vegas definately go here. It is even worht the bus and cab ride from the strip.",

This was definitely a place unfamiliar to me and it almost felt did not have your typical Vegas aesthetic.  We started with oysters and it was oyster heaven. Every slurp was fresh and decadence. We had oyster at Bacchanal buffet and it was no comparison! Follow it with a gulp of Kirin, I'm a happy guy!  The Palace Pan Roast is exceptionally good. I mean after a weekend of decadence at E, Tableau and Bachannal... This dish still stood out. Absolutely Delicious!  So... Oyster, Pan Roast, and Beer... That's all you need to know...especially after a night of debauchery.",

    "text": "This is definitely a stop for us every time we hit Vegas. The place is super small and very popular so there's usually a long line so prepare to wait. Last time I was here though, we went around 4pm and there was barely any wait so that was awesome since we were starving and craving it so badly!   I'll start off with reviewing the service. I definitely think the service isn't too bad but it could be improved. Some guy ahead of us sat down with his son and they complained that no one was taking their order, but they say themselves down so I guess the waiter didn't see them. So be sure to wait til they seat you. It was annoying because hey had some empty chairs but there were dirty plates laying around and workers are either moving slow or talking to each other. After we sat down though, I did notice that the servers were polite (even though they kept talking about random things, which slowed them down a bit) and the chef was pretty friendly with the customers.   On to the food!  We ordered a dozen of oysters for &19.99 and I gotta say, they're soooo fresh! They size of the oysters ranged from medium to large so that was a plus. Then my boyfriend and I ordered a combo pan roast ($23.99), our fave! It's a creamy tomato based soup with different seafoods inside such as lobster, shrimp,  We just shared one  and ordered an extra side of rice since we could never finish it on our own. You're able to choose the spice level, we went with the 6 and barely tasted any spiciness. I would probably go with the 8 next time.    I definitely recommend this place! Stop by if you're ever in Vegas.",

Would have expected much better quality of oysters at an oyster bar. Now to their main dish.  Had their Combo Pan Roast.  It was good but not exceptional as many says in their reviews.   Would have given the Pan Roast a 4 and the oysters brought the restaurant down to a 3. Lucky there was no line, i would not have been happy if i waited in line for this meal.",

    "text": "Knock me over with a feather.  I would not suspect that one of the best seafood places in Las Vegas is a little 18-seater bar inside of Palace Station.    There are literally 18 seats, and the line can be up to an hour long to get a coveted spot.  When we went, by the grace of whatever you pray to, there were 2 open seats just waiting for us.  As soon as we sat down, that line started piling up.  The best part of this place is the experience of watching them make your food.  There are all these steam pots right in front of you and it is fascinating to watch as they boil over with deliciousness.  The chef that was there that night...I believe his name was Ricardo, worked fast and was very engaging with the guests, cracking jokes and making you feel at home.  My husband and I got a dozen oysters.  Warning: the oysters are HUGE.  I saw them, salivated, ordered, then couldn't finish them because they are so big.  We both got the combo pan roast.  Creamy, tomatoey, full of seafood, a little spicy.  Coming from San Diego, I have always been on the hunt for some good seafood, and this place has it!  They also have jambalaya, gumbos, clam chowders, bouillebaise, and more.  A little slice of oceanic heaven waiting for you (or should I say, you will wait for it...a long time) inside of Palace Station.",

This place is not worth the wait which was just the opposite from some local people that were in line. My wife and I had to wait for two hours and 15 min. to get two seats out of the 19 seats at the bar. The system of how they run this business SUCKS! If there are not enough seats for your group, they dont skip your group, they would just wait until all available seats are open for you. The service ladies were kind of rushing you when you order the food bcuz its busy with not enough workers. One chef only which was very slow on making your food, which is the reason of long wait in lines. At the end of every meal they cooked, they washed the pot with wire brush and the green scotch brite pad right in front of the bar that is a foot in front of you, at some point water can be splashed over the counter, the pot with the broth they use next to it or even your drinks. I dont know if i got the food poison from the oyesters or gumbo. Bottom line it wasnt worth the 2hr15 min wait. Its not like they were that much cheaper than going to a seafood restaurant..",

I found this place by seeing my brother's yelp and decided to check out the hype and it was one of the best decisions I made that weekend. Lines can be long because everything is made to order and there are about 10 seats total. Come between 2-4 and there shouldn't be much of a wait.   We had some beer and oyster bloody mary shots to start. For an appetizer, we had the seafood platter. Raw oysters and clams and jumbo shrimp.  It was so fresh and delicious! Who knew raw seafood could be that fresh in the middle of the desert!     The seafood pan roast. OMG. The Pan Roast.  What the heck is a pan roast? I still have no clue.  But it's creamy bowl of goodness served with a scoop of rice.  It looks and acts like a gumbo but without southern creole flavors.  You can choose to make it as spicy as you want. I got an 8 and it was pretty spicy. Each bowl is pretty large and I saw a lot of locals share a bowl between 2. We each ordered our own and I almost finished it all! It was so good I couldn't stop eating!   Drinks were cheap and plentiful, food was unique, delicious, and huge. Our cook was hilarious. A great experience!",

I decided to come here after a late night/early morning work out and even at 4 in the morning, there were a few patrons at the counter.  I think they were preparing for the day so things were very messy, so I gave them the benefits of the doubt.  I sat down and the waiter took my drink order.  When asked what he recommended, he said without hesitation, the combo pan roast.  The \"combo\" consisted of lobster, crab, and shrimp, three winners in my book.  I asked for it to be made not too spicey, a 2 on a scale of 10.  Pre-measured amounts of lobster, crab and shrimp were spooned into dish along with diced bell peppers and seasoning.  All this was put into a special steam heated pot and fish stock was added along with a cream based soup.  This was allowed to come to a boil and cook down a bit.  Then everything was poured into a large bowl and a scoop of rice was added.  The chef can seperate one order into however many bowls you like which is a good thing, since one order is very filling.  I accidentally burned my tongue I was so excited to try it.  The pan roast was delicious.  The flavor of the soup can be best described as fish or seafood and old bay seasoning.  It was rich and complimented the lobster, crab, and shrimp very well.  The addition of the rice made it very filling, I struggled to finish my order.    Service was good, not sure if it was because of the number of customers, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  My total tab including tip for the combo pan roast (most expensive) and an ice tea was under $25.  Not bad considering that one order of pan raost could have easily fed two people.   I will definitely go back to try the other pan roasts!",

    "text": "I have to admit I was skeptical of this place. It's in the Palace Station, the food is relatively expensive, and having family from New Orleans makes me a very picky seafood eater! I was so, so wrong. I should have known this many Yelpers can't be wrong!!  I'm kind of obsessed with lobster bisque so I had to go for the Combo Pan Roast. At $19.99 it was quite the gamble, but this was actually a bowl of \"soup\" worth the high price tag!   At 11 AM, there was no wait and we even questioned whether it was actually open 24 hours since there was literally no one there. We sat down and were served quickly. It was such a treat to watch it being made and it was clear the guy knew his stuff.   I'd compare this to a lobster bisque, but I'll say this is the best \"bisque\" I've ever eaten! It had much more depth of flavor than a bisque does and so many more yummy ingredients. The shrimp were HUGE and cooked perfectly. Very high quality. The crab meat was so-so, but the lobster was phenomenal. There were perfect tiny bites of red peppers that added the right amount of sweetness. I ate it without the rice and could barely finish half.  I will say I wouldn't wait 2 hours for this \"soup\" (you Yelpers are crazy!), but at 11 AM with no wait, it's something I'll be doing again and again - I already have a return visit scheduled for Wednesday! Don't let the ghetto location or high price tag scare you off - the quality will far exceed your expectations.",

    "text": "Yum! My friend and I got into Vegas on a Friday night at about midnight and was looking for a place to eat. We had never been to Oyster Bar, and was on the fence because it had such good reviews...but at Palace Station, really?  When we got there at about 1:20 AM, there was a line! We were surprised! Luckily it only took us about an hour to get seated and worth the wait. We shared a pan roast (combo - recommended to us), clams and linguine, the clam chowder, half dozen raw oysters, and a root beer. Yes, it was a hearty amount!  While waiting for the food, I noticed how the cook was preparing everything. Each order was made to order and prepared individually. I think this really adds to the flavor and freshness of the dish. This is especially unique because the types of food they serve is usually slowed cook and takes long periods of time to prepare, but they were able shorten the period and still make it delicious.   The clam chowder was one of the best I've had a in a while. It was on the thicker side in regards to soup, but plenty of clams and light on the potatoes, which is always a plus. The pan roast was tasty and I will definitely be reordering this dish - seafood in a lobster bisque...can't go wrong! The half dozen oysters was delicious w/cocktail sauce and horseradish. Finally, my clams and linguine was good. I am personally always on the hunt for the best clams and linguine since Santa Barbara, but with no success, while I can't say this was the best I've every had, it sure does come close! I had left-overs and was totally bummed that I forgot it in my hotel room before returning home! ='(  I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas, because I will definitely be hitting Oyster Bar again!",

As soon as we step off the plane in Vegas this is the first place that we stop.  OMG it is so good.  We have also had a few other dishes which were also fantastic but nothing beats the pan roasts here.  I hate that there are only about 15 chairs at this tiny little oyster bar because the line takes forever to get through.  This past weekend we waited for well over an hour to be seated.  I want to say it was probably closer to two.  It was well worth it though.  This is definitely a must stop place while in Vegas.",

Now on to the food;  you really cannot go wrong with anything you order wether its the jambalaya, gumbo or pan roasts.  You just need to monitor how hot you make the dishes because its the spice that really brings out the flavor.  They season on a scale of 1-10.  10 being the hottest...As the previous review goes into, parking is plentiful and service is attentive...try it next time you are in town or nearby!",

Mmmmmmm.  Best clam chowder I've tried, beats even those from the Bay area.  They don't skimp on the seafood and the base for the stew is very tasty.  I am surprised that people give bad reviews of this place just because of the service, There's about a million reviews here that say there's a lot of wait time so why are people surprised?  It's a bar, not a michelin-rated restaurant.   The service can be improved, but what can you do?  It's not like any of the staff is slacking.  They definitely work hard and they try to be fast and friendly.  Come out mid week around 2 am and you won't wait long.",

    "text": "IF YOU'RE EVER IN VEGAS, YOU MUST GO HERE. You will regret it if you don't! I heard this as well prior to my first visit, and pondered the same thing, \"What's so great about raw oysters?\" But aha! It's not only raw oysters, but it's their freakin' PAN ROAST.  Sfjalfjsldfsakfjsakfjdsalfjas --- That is what comes to mind; just mind-blowing that nothing can describe how delicious it is!    I ordered the House Pan Roast with noodles at level 7 spiciness.  In case you don't know (cause I didn't), the house pan roast is a bisque-like concoction filled with crab, shrimp, chicken, and sausage.  Super savory, buttery, and total hearty goodness.  The chef would cook your food right in front of you in broilers and dumps it into your bowl!  Cons: - It only seats about 15 people, so be prepared to wait. We waited for an hour. The long wait is due to people eating hot/spicy food, which takes more time to consume.  - Our chef was totally testy.  A couple of Yelpers mentioned this too and as well the patrons sitting next to us who go there often. The chef is a young, thin woman who never smiles. Apparently the awesome chef is a male one with facial hair who makes convos w/eaters and jokes around.  He was just getting off his shift the moment we sat.   Our server, who seemed sweet, got carried away flirting with a group of boys and overlooked us girls who got sat first. She took their order first, and it was an honest oversight. When she saw us, she felt bad and quickly took our order. She reassured us that our food will be cooked before those guys. And we told her to not sweat it. But then the chef snidely says, \"It's all gonna be done the same time.\"  Geez chef lady, the server felt bad, she was making amends to us, why would you do that?  All in all, despite the cons of the long wait time and possibility of a not-up-to-par chef, the Oyster Bar gets 5 stars for providing such an extraordinary dish!  TIPS: One pan roast for 2 people is plenty! So share and save your money :) And get noodles instead of rice; hey, or both on the side even!  Now where can I get pan roast in Orange County, CA?!",

    "text": "After a 1.5hr wait, I'd have to say this place is overrated and overpriced. $19 for a giant bowl that one person definitely can't finish. $5 split plate fee? C'mon...  I ordered the Combo Pan Roast and while it's tasty, it's mostly just a giant bowl of creamy thick tomato soup. Came with one scoop of rice which is definitely not enough considering the giant bowl of soup. Do yourself a favor and ask for another scoop of rice. I tried Domo's gumbo and definitely preferred the pan roast since it had a more tangy flavor. Saw someone order the ciaopinno and made a mental note to order that next time since it looked like more seafood came with that order than the pan roast. My main gripe about the Combo pan roast is that it's supposed to come with shrimp, crab, and lobster. You can make out the shrimp but the lobster and crab were harder to spot since the lobster came already shelled so you'd have to dig around your bowl of soup to find the lobster. At first it looked like a piece of fish, but when I bit into it, it seemed more like lobster. The crab comes shredded...so if you don't finish your entire bowl of thick-ass soup, you end up leaving precious morself of crab...what a waste!! I want to eat all of the crab!!!!!  Try to come very EARLY or very late because although the counter seats 18, they only have 6 kettles cooking at a time, which means that the other 12 people have to wait 20 miniutes before their food even starts cooking. We found out the hard way.....  On a side note, one of the dealers at Rio told us that South Point Casino also has an Oysters Bar there and that there is a lot more seating there so if we ever decide to go back, we'll check out South Point's bar instead.  PS: While I was perusing the menu, an asian fellow approached me and informed me that his restaurant, The Boiler in Chino HIlls offers similar kettle-steamed gumbo fare. He mentioned that he studied under the executive Chef of Oyster Bar. So, that might be a good one to check out if you're ever in the area...",

Possibly it is because I live on the ocean with access to literally just caught oysters, but I was highly dissatisfied by this place; especially after all the hype.    My clam chowder was good, my friend's salmon was good and cooked professionally...  But the whole reason we went there, was for the oysters.  We got a dozen, and while they were of pretty good quality in terms of taste (not the best, but I am spoiled), the guy who shucked them had absolutely no clue what he was doing or was in a rush because I've never had so much broken shell in an oyster, ever.  I can shuck better then that on my own.  I almost broke a tooth and it ruined the entire experience.    This is absolutely unacceptable for a place that is touted as a highly recommended Oyster Bar.  2 stars from me.  We still left a +20% tip, but I won't take a chance at this place again.    If you can get a good shucker, the prices are great and the other food was good.  Disappointed I had to experience it this way.",

    "text": "Who would walk into Palace Station to eat? Not me, until I was introduced to Oyster Bar. How could it be that I've never been here?? Well, thanks to my friend, I've been enlightened.  Oyster Bar is located in the Palace Station Hotel. They serve seafood based soups, oysters and a couple other things I haven't bothered to look at. There are only about 15 seats around the bar so the wait can be very long at peak times. Come off peak and save your stomach from eating itself while watching others enjoy their meal. I was only in Vegas two nights and we came here twice, it was THAT GOOD. I had the pan roast, jambalaya, shrimp scampi and gumbo. I would have to say I like the jambalaya the best, but would order it with the rice on the side. The pan roast is cream based which can be good and bad depending on your digestive system. Portions are HUGE, but it's nice to get different dishes to share. The gumbo comes second, the scampi third and the pan roast last. Not that the pan roast is bad in any way, but I don't care for cream based soups. Did I mention wine pours are very generous? To-the-rim!   I even ordered a togo order to bring back to LA for my man, now that's LOVE!!  Be kind to the waitress and cook here, they work very hard and are amazing at what they do. If you're in a rush, this isn't your place. It's well worth the wait.  I care for places like this more than the fancy strip celebrity chef joints. The food sticks to my bones and I'm more than happy to pay. You won't leave disappointed or hungry.   Would you mind delivering some to me please??!",

    "text": "This is my absolute favorite place to dine at when visiting Vegas.  In fact, I sometimes come to Vegas just so I can eat here!!!    For starters...I always go for a bloody mary oyster shooter, followed by a dozen oysters on a half shell.  The oysters here are sooo fresh and shucked perfectly that sometimes I can not refrain myself from ordering a second dozen.  (I'm a fat ass, I know.)  From there...you must, must, MUST order a pan roast.  You'll see all sorts of other distractions like the Bouillabaisse, Jambalaya, and Gumbos on the menu to throw you off your game...but trust me on this. Imagine a creamy, cajun style lobster bisque with a kick....that's the amazing pan roast and it's the only way to go.    My favorite is the House Pan Roast (not to be mistaken for the Palace Pan Roast), which comes with generous portions of lobster, clams, crab meat, and enormous shrimp, served with your choice of pasta or jasmine rice.   They'll also ask you for the level spice you would like and if you can handle the heat, go for levels of 7-10, but be aware...this kind of spiciness will hit you as the meal progresses, so don't go to high, or else you won't be able to enjoy it.   Also, the portions are HUGE...I'm always greedy and have to order my own, but I can never finish one! (I know...you're thinking it's because of all the oysters I ate)   Lastly, the service which is the biggest kicker of why I continuously come back time after time.  RICARDO...he is THEE  master chef that serves these truly wonderful and extremely tasty creations.  He is delightfully charming and friendly with everyone sitting around his bar.  Last week my girlfriends and I came back twice within one weekend just so we could hang out with Ricardo...well, and the oysters of course.    Located inside Palace Station...this place is now open 24 hours, so come after midnight to avoid a looooooooong wait.",

We stood in line for about 45 minutes, and while we did take the opportunity to study the menu and figure out what we wanted, it was still 45 minutes of STANDING. There are no waiting benches or chairs. Sure one of us could have gone to gamble while the other waited, but...  9:35-9:45pm - Found ourselves indeed staring down the people who were already seated, mentally shouting at them in our minds, \"HURRY. UP!!! You've already finished eating! JUST LEAVE!\" and \"No you REALLY don't need another beer! WALK. AWAY.\"  9:45-9:50pm - Yeay! Finally seated!!! Having already spent the previous 45 minutes studying the menu and deciding on what we wanted, we ordered the Crab Pan Roast (6 spiciness) and the Crab Gumbo (6 spiciness). We would've ordered it spicier but considering how starving we were, we didn't want to burn a hole in our empty guts. I also order a Bloody Mary Oyster Shot - it was okay, could barely taste the vodka, and the oyster was meh. The service is also meh - the sous chefs barely register our presence, and the servers seem tired and harried.  9:50-10:10pm - We wait for our food - it's actually simmering right in front of us in these conical cookers - and studiously avoid the gazes of people standing in line willing us to leave early. My boyfriend goes and grabs our jackets as we're seated under a chilly air vent.  10:10pm - Our food is served. Each comes with a scoop of white rice, and it's temperature HOT. Now we understand the slow eaters. The spiciness of a 6 was less noticeable in his gumbo, but mine was quite nice. We're now thankful for the chilly air vent. The food is DELICIOUS. Wonderful texture, meatiness, spiciness, and flavor. And there's A LOT of it. A nice big bowl of each. We outright ignore all the people standing in line staring at us - it is so worth savoring every mouthful.  10:40pm - We leave, full, sated. I hope to return again!",

I've tried nearly everything on the menu and by far the best thing on the menu is the Combo Pan Roast. I also almost always get oysters on the half shell when I visit. The oysters are always super fresh and very reasonably priced. They currently have a late night special where a half dozen is 8.99 (full dozen is 16.99 if I remember correctly).  The only negatives (and they're big ones) are the wait and the service. If you go during a peak times (weekend evenings), expect to wait about an hour in line and then another half hour to get your food after getting seated. Basically, the place is really popular and there are about 16 seats at the bar and 2 overworked chefs who often struggle to keep up with the orders.   If you go during the day and get Ricardo as your chef you're in for a treat. He's super friendly and probably the best oyster shucker I've ever seen. He definitely gets your food out faster than the other chefs.",

The New England clam chowder is great, the house gumbo is awesome, and the combo pan roast is out of this world.   They ask you how spicy you want your creole dishes on a scale of 1 to 10, and I ordered it 8, which was just right. Others were ordering it at a 30, so fans of spicy food will love this place.",

So much seafood, so much flavor. It's like an explosion in your mouth with every bite. Gosh it's good.  - Jambalaya - delish as well, a little dry for my taste. I like the pan roast better b/c it's more liquidy - Gumbo - was kind of bitter...or maybe I was hungover? haha But I took home half of it and ate it later and I dont know if it was b/c the rice was all soaked in with the liquid or what but it tasted amazing!! Weird....I know - Alaska clam chowder - probably is my 2nd favorite dish here. It's soooo good.",

    "text": "Oyster Bar was the first stop of our most recent Vegas trip. I have heard so many good things about it, but this was our first time trying it out.  Parking -- Parking is easy. It is located inside the Palace Station Casino, so there was plenty of parking!  Service -- The service is great! Everyone the works there is super friendly and attentive. The servers are literally right in front of you so its easy to get their attention when you need something.  Atmosphere -- This is a small restaurant. It is literally a bar with about 12 seats in the casino. They cook your order right in front of you, so you get to talk to the chef and servers while you watch them prepare your food. The wait can be quite long because of the limited seating. My party of 4 waited about 30 minutes to get seated. However, I  imagine at rush hour the wait can be really long. Definitely not for large parties.  Food -- The food is delicious. Especially if you love seafood. The thing to get is the Pan Roast. It is probably the most popular thing to eat. However since my 3 other friends got the Pan Roast I ordered the Alaskan chowder (clams, cod, and crab) served Manhattan Style (You can also get New England). I was also able to try the Pan Roast from one of my friends. Both dishes were great. Both were generously filled with seafood. The Pan Roast had a nice creamy broth and a spicy kick. I loved it! I imagine this would be great food too eat following a night or drinking.   Oyster Bar is delicious. It was so good that some of my friends returned for a second meal the next day (I ended up at Cut), but I definitely considered coming back as well. Vegas just has too many good places to eat! I'll definitely be back at Oyster Bar on my next trip!",

    "text": "I consider my foray here to be a complete Yelp letdown.  I arrived at approximately 10 pm and still faced a 2 hour wait to be seated with approximately 10-15 people ahead of me in line.  The reason for the long waits is the limited bar seating.  There are approximately 16 seats and only 6 roasting pans so at any given time, half the bar is eating and half are waiting for the food with each turnover taking approximately 40 minutes.    Once seated, there is an additional 30 minute wait for food.  Math check: you've now invested 2.5 hours so it better be some mind-blowing food to overcome the interminable wait times.  Looking around the faces of my fellow diners, it was clear that Oyster Bar did not deliver.  We all looked sullen and grumpy - reasonable given it was past midnight and we were all starving.   If you want faster sustenance, I recommend getting a bowl of clam chowder.  Even that took about 15 minutes to arrive.  It was nondescript in every way.   I ordered the Palace Pan Roast, with Lobster Shrimp and Crab in a creamy tomato base.   The open cooking system, admittedly, is a decent show and I enjoyed watching the chef make our dishes.  There are steam pots and into them go, in this particular order and at designated times: 1) a pat of butter, 2) your seafood, 3) clam broth, 4) the tomato/cream soup, and 5) a scoop full of crab meat.  John's Gumbo was similar.  First the butter, then vegetables and seafood, clam broth, a dark roux, and a scoop of crab meat.   The problem is that there is a haphazard timing system.  All the butter goes into all the pots at once.  Then, the chef comes back around for the seafood.  Once the broths and soups go in, he usually takes that opportunity to focus on shucking the bivalves.  It was a  new form of torture, watching your food bubble furiously away, while the chef man-handled a dozen oysters or prepare shrimp cocktail.  Literally, all you wanted to do was reach out and help yourself to the soup and instead the chef spent a quarter of an hour on each fruits de mer plate.   The wait was certainly not worth it.  The Chef spent so much time on the shucking that I think our dishes over-reduced.   My pan roast was an inch lower in volume than the next item and I knew it was going to be salty.   You get a big soup bowl full of a creamy tomato soup, one scoop of rice, a few shrimps, and lots of crab pieces.  The proportions were so off.  I would have that much soup for a family of four and at least two scoops of rice apiece.  I don't know how anyone could have spooned so much salty soup without anything to soak it up.  John's Gumbo was similar except it tasted like liquified roux.    We also saw some unsanitary behavior going on.  The Chef washed the steam pots after emptying their stews into the bowls and left the bowls inches from the pots he was washing, certain to let dish water get into the food.  Not appetizing.",

Everything is made to order right in front of you. My personal favorite is the pan roast which is tomato and cream based. You choose the level of spiciness from 1-10. They throw in habanero peppers if you order a 9 or 10. I had a taste of my friend's New England clam chowder (chowder part only) and it was pretty tasty.

However we ordered a dozen of oysters ,after first taste, I regret that I did order that much. The oysters are NOT tasty at all, no favor that I had to add a lot of sauces into it and still don't taste good. I love oysters and had try many places and this is one of the worst oysters I ever have. I don't think this is ocean oysters. We also ordered the steam muscle and the sea food compo are very delicious. Definitely will not order oysters here again.",

    "text": "First of all let me tell you all..... I rarely like to spend money on myself eating out. RARELY  But, I saw the reviews and I was already staying here at The Palace Station... So Why Not?!?  ALWAYS a line. The night before, I got back at 2:30am and I was like, 'What are these people waiting for?!?'...... It was Tuesday BTW  One Yelp review wrote PAN ROAST in Caps like 72 times so I pretty much had my mind made up.  Only 6 people in front of me..... 1 Hour Wait... I NEVER wait... but I had some drink and I was good and the two couples in front of me chatted it up, which added to the experience.  We are all waiting, and one of the bfs isn't impressed and the other couple, it's their first time. So a lot of bantering and foreplay for lack of a better word. Anticipation, works better I guess. lol   Listen, I've been to Vegas at least a dozen times. I've always wanted to find a goto place. I've always wanted to say, 'I've got to go here before I leave!!!'....  Well. This is it.  Let me ask you... Pan Roast. What does that sound like? It sounds like someone trying to make a pot roast in a pan... :D  And maybe that's part of the draw. Because what I had, the pan roast with all seafood, was anything but a 'pan roast'...  It looked like a soup. It played the part of a gumbo. It was Cambpell's in a bowl...  But...  Have you ever seen a car on the road and think... how is it running?!?  Seen a guy and think, how does he have that girl?!?  Talked to someone really stupid and think, how did they make it this far in life?!?  That's what happens when you try the 'Pan Roast'.   You assume (Spoiler Alert WAY Late) it's going to be a soupy, seafood, gumbo, but it's something WAY more,  It's a blend. A blend that says, 'Will you marry me?'   And after a couple of bites, you're like 'Hell Yeah!'  'Pre-Nup?', 'Where do I sign???'  Seriously.  Next time in Vegas, I'll be looking for the one that got away.   The infamous 'Pan Roast' beauty I only met at The Oyster Bar. Sorry slots. strip clubs, ubers, and gambling... I have more important things to spend money on. heartemojihere  Hashtag True Love",

I helped them order what's best on the menu then another person (also from China) came and asked me if they can take raw oysters Togo.  The answer is no - not in Vegas -- can't take raw food Togo.   They asked me to call another store and see if other store would sell it.   A rude guy ( think he is the know it all ) decided to say something rude to the us.  Can't believe how people lack matters these days.

There's great food in china town that won't force you to stand in line for a few hours without so much as a drink service from the cocktail waitress or the courtesy to join 2019 and let you hold your place in line with yelp. But really the most frustrating thing is the groups of 5 or 6 people that show up and make every solo person and couple wait frustratingly long amounts of time so that all those seats next to each other can be available. Vegas is a 24 hr town, there are other options at 3am. And there's absolutely no reason to go here during normal dining hours instead of some of the seafood places on the strip.",

Anyways , I don't like my food TOO spicy , but I got a level 2 of the pan roast - not spicy at all . Level 5 is perfect !  The bbq shrimp has the BEST broth and flavor - even better than the combo pan roast - it's VERY GOOD ! Order it \"soupy\" = extra broth  Totally underrated . It's absolutely amazing .  The combo pan roast is a tomato cream base - so if that's not your thing , don't bother because you can definitely taste the tomato .  Without enough spice it favors a rich bisque .   There is a cook there \"mr brown\" - everyone says he's the best at cooking and seasoning .  Go , enjoy the experience . It's great",

    "text": "STAFF WAS EXTREMELY RUDE! Never eating here again!!!!!!!!  I was excited to try this place especially since there were sooooo many good reviews. My girl friend and I came from out of town and we waited 2 hours in line to eat here. It was about 1 am when we got seated. I told her it would be worth it.  I don't know if staff was in a horrible mood or maybe they were discriminating us for being young but they treated us with horrible customer service. We were the only two young girls in the restaurant. Everyone else seating next to us were an older crowd.  The lady the waitress Embarrassed me in front of all the customers sitting next to me with rude comments and harassing me and laughing making me feel like I wasn't good enough to eat at that restaurant. I eventually ordered clam chowder and a half dozen oysters and lastly an entree but they were cooking other customers who ordered after us before ours. You can clearly see who orders and see the cook make the food in front of you.   Before we even finished our clam chowder the second waitress with the glasses didn't ask if we were finished she just took our plate didn't make eye contact or ask anything if we needed anything else or if we would like to finish it. It was pretty rude since there was still half a bowl full left but We didn't mind because we had an entree coming up.   We were waiting 30 minutes for the rest of our food and during that time the cook TWICE sprayed water with the sink onto my friend getting all her clothes face and food wet (our bread that we were snacking on) We didn't complain the first time we simply moved our seats to the left and thought it was on accident but the second time we told him the issue of him wetting us again and he replied \"it's for the show\" everyone was laughing again. We were in shock with that reply and very embarrassed. UNACCEPTABLE. RUDE.   We left and gave ZERO tip. Horrible customer service. I've never had horrible customer service like this ever to write a review on yelp. I'm still unhappy being treated this way. The food may have been great but all the staff were rude and this is truly unacceptable behavior. Me and my friend are two young girls trying to eat and have a good time in Vegas and they ruined our experience here. This issue definitely needs to be brought up and some sort of training about customer service needs to be placed.  I would give 1 star but the clam chowder (from what I was able to eat) was pretty good. They ruined our appetite and didn't even consider eating the entree.",

I tried the following (ordered from most favorite):  Dirty Alaskan Clam Chowder $24.99 - THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  Worth every penny!  It was filled with seafood. It was very very satisfying.  I'm ready for more.  This was my first time coming here so I wasn't sure how their spicy level works.  I got level 4 supposedly it's a medium but I thought it was pretty mild.  Definitely can handle a higher level.    Lobster Pan Roast $24.99 - This was pretty good as well.  There were big pieces of lobsters.  My sister got a level 8.  At first, it wasn't spicy and then after, it had a nice kick to it.    Oysters (price varies) - We order two dozen.  Came out to be about $50.  I didn't taste as fresh and good as I thought it was going to be but it was decent.    I'm ready to go back to Vegas for some more clam chowder!",

We soon discovered why: it is absolutely delicious! The oysters are huge and have the cleanest taste of any place I've ever visited, edging out my favorite place in Myrtle Beach. On top of that they are $1 per in the mornings, which would make you say \"who eats oysters in the morning?\". I can gladly raise both my hands to this.  The pan roasts are the go-to here, and I would suggest getting extra items if you can, with emphasis on the shrimp and maybe crab (if they have the legs and not just the meat). The oyster shooters are an option too and they are straight to the point. They have a spice level but it's scaled depending on who's cooking, not by a measurement.  It never gets out of hand that you can't eat anything though, so if you like spice don't be scared!  Anticipate a wait if you come outside of late night/breakfast hours.  Worth every penny!",

Yes, there was a line at 10pm That was probably 4 years ago. Since then, I've learned my lesson. Don't go at prime hours like dinner time on a Saturday. Go during Monday mornings, after a drunken night at 5am, etc etc. Or send your bf to get you take out while you lay in bed. Don't let that little line fool you. They move awfully slow because there's only 15 seats and they make the panroasts fresh, right in front of your eyes.   Now, was this possible 2-3 hour wait worth it? hellllllllllllyaaaaaaa. Would I wait again? no because now I know better! Ok, i love this place I really do. Getting on to the food. This is a place where I send everyone to go when you come to town asking for good eats. This place is a gd institution. Of course, get the panroast. My friend who is a particularly picky/anti seafood eater actually liked the combo panroast. Portion is large and easily enough for 2 small people or a pig (like me). I've tried panroast at different places in vegas and in cali and it's just never as good as palace station. Oysters are fresh and big. It's good but not the best. I wouldn't wait in line for the oysters.  Anyways, believe the hype and get ready w a drink in hand while waiting.",

    "text": "Dude. First time here and this was one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. The pan roast is out of this world. I do NOT give out 5 star reviews easily. Something really has to blow me away to give a fiver out. From the moment we sat down, the bartender/cook/waiter guy was awesome and super friendly and the meal to follow this interaction was beautiful.  I got the pan roast at a 7 heat and it was like heaven. There is a rich, full, passionate flavor here that you just don't come across very often. I mean every bite was a journey into the uncharted depths of flavor town. I've had pan roasts before a few times in my life and this felt like a completely different meal.   The wife had the chicken gumbo and it felt like we were right back in New Orleans. A solid 4/5 there.  Shrimp cocktail was amazingly fresh and delicious also.   Beer was ice cold, food was dumb good, service was awesome.   The ONLY downside may be the wait, but whatever, it was worth it. Play some slots and have a cocktail while you wait and thank me later.   This is a definite stop when I come to Vegas from now on.   Keep up the great work guys",

I didn't really care for their Caesar salad, it could have been better. However, the combo pan roast was delicious! I would come back here again, but I wouldn't wait any longer than an hour for it.",

If you like spicy but not burning my mouth spicy get it at a 2 maybe at 3. The clam chowder wasn't anything to rave about but it was good. The chef knows his craft, the food was presented beautifully. I would definitely recommend just don't try to order too spicy because you will find it inedible.",

I've gone twice and both times my group and I had to stand in line for a long time, but we left full and very happy.  The boulli-roast and the pan roasts are very good. I do like the boulli-roast better than the pan roast, but not by much. Creamy seafood goodness! I'm drooling just thinking about it.   The staff there are so friendly and funny. They chat with you and joke with you while you enjoy your meal.   These people know their seafood. You won't regret spending all that time staring at the slot machines in line.   Tip #1: Share if you have a small appetite. The bowls are HUGE! and you will probably take home the rest.   Tip #2 Don't waste your time on appetizers. Your entree will be big enough.",

Just came after clubbing at Omnia and was looking forward to some good grub , and minimal wait at 4:30am  Complimentary bread -soft,  fresh,  absorbed the butter well  Happy hour oysters -available from 1am to 9am, $10 for 6 -big, fresh and tasty . I'm not even a raw oyster fan but these were delicious! Ate note than I expected to.  The combo horseradish and cocktail sauce  and lemon complimented the oysters perfectly  Pan roast combination -freshly made and individualized upon your order in front of you.   It was loaded with crab , lobster and shrimp.  The creamy tomato base went so well with the white rice,  it was the prefect starch to bring out the flavor of the broth.   This was definitely the star of the show . I highly recommend this dish and would definitely come back here again one day!   Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was intimate due to limited bar style seating and seeing the cook  Definitely worth a try during non-peak hours and I plan to return one day",

    "text": "Oyster Bar is located inside the Palace Station casino in Las Vegas.  It is not on the strip so don't go looking for it on the strip!  Oyster Bar has limited seating which means that the line to get a seat at the bar can range anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour.  My bf and I had to wait over an hour and a half to get seated.  Don't worry though, the wait is worth it.  Remember, this is still considered a bar where they serve alcohol so you must be at least 21 years of age to sit down at the bar.  This is not a child friendly place so don't bring your kids and make them wait in line for over an hour just to find out that they can't sit at the bar.  There is also a big sign at the front of the line stating this.  It can get frustrating standing in line when there are people in front of you who act as a place holder in line for their uncles, aunts, mom, dad, siblings, half siblings, nieces, nephews, grandma, grandpa, and etc.  So don't start counting people who are in front of you to try and determine how much longer you have to wait in line because people and their long lost family members are miraculously united when they reach the front of the line to be seated.  *eye roll*  I'm sorry, but if you leave the line, you should lose your spot and have to go to the back of the line!  Oyster Bar needs a better system in place so this doesn't continue to happen.  It would also be nice if they placed your name on a wait list and they text you when seats are ready.  That way, no one is standing in line for hours!    Once my bf and I were seated, we were given bread  & butter, waters, and menus.  We ordered half dozen oysters, the combo pan roast and the bouill-roast.  We normally order a whole dozen oysters ($19.99), but I'm so glad we only ordered half a dozen ($11.99) because the oysters here are humongous!  They come on ice with lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, and horseradish.  They tasted pretty fresh for being an oyster bar located in the dessert.  FYI, no one got sick.    As for the combo pan roast ($23.99), it is a creamy tomato stew cooked with shrimp, crab, lobster, and a hint of Brandy.  It is served with white rice.  When you order, you can select how spicy you want your pan roast to be.  I selected 6 on the spicy meter and the pan roast was more on the mild side so if you want something truly spicy, go above 6!  The combo pan roast was delicious, and I would definitely come back and order it again, but I do have to admit that it is not my #1 favorite pan roast of all time.  Ocean Trail in Arizona is still the best pan roast I've ever had.  This combo pan roast is definitely #2 though.  I wished they put more seafood into the pan roast like other places do, but overall, I would definitely recommend this dish.  The bouill-roast ($23.99) used to be a secret menu item but is now on the menu due to popular demand.  The bouill-roast is a hybrid between a bouillabaisse and a pan roast.  However, the texture of the stew was a little more on the watery side and tasted less \"tomatoey\" compared to the pan roast.  The seafood in this dish included crab, shrimp, mussels,  lobster, clams, cod, and a side of white rice.  The bouill-roast is just as delicious and is a great option if you can't decide between a pan roast or a bouillabaisse.  The service was great!  The staff were friendly and did their best to clean the bar area and seat people as soon as possible.  The Chef did make an effort to check up on you to make sure that everything tasted good.  The prices of the dishes were fair and comparable to other oyster bars.  I know that the long wait in line is annoying as hell, but there is a good reason for the long line.  That long wait is due to the amazing food!  The food is worth the wait.  Please have some patience and don't be like me getting all mad and wanting to go ghetto on people cutting in line.  I totally blame it on me being hangry.",

This time around I decided to order something different than the Pan Roast and Gumbo that I usually order and settled with the Bouill Roast. The Bouill Roast is a secret menu item which is a combination of Bouillabaisse and Pan Roast. It was perfection at a spicy level of 2! I can't believe I've never discovered this before! It's not as creamy as the Pan Roast but still maintains a great tomato flavor without the heavy cream. It's loaded with crab, lobster, shrimp, mussels, and clams. The wait isn't any better than any other time so expect to wait upwards of an hour before you get your food.",

A line that looks like a 2 hour wait (12 stools total at this Osyter Bar, 12 people in front of us- and honestly that number keeps changing as people filter in an out to gamble and drink while they wait).  I hate to proclaim this, but despite the wait- this Divey Palace Station meal is a Vegas must try.   My friends had been here many times and I had not, but they insisted despite my begrudged hangry attitude that I HAD TO TRY the Pan Roast, a Osyter Bar version of creamy tomato creole style etouffee with meats and seafood- topped with rice. At this point I was so hungry I would have been happy with a hot dog I found on the ground. I wasn't in the mood for that type cajun/creole of food at the time but went along. By the time we made it to the front of the line (2 hours)- I was fuel tank empty, my feet hurt from the heels and standing, and wasn't speaking to anyone. Also my eyelids felt like they were metal shutters that just wanted to see the hotel bed. I clamored up onto the stool, watched chef Ricardo made us 6 heaping bowls of Pan Roast in various flavors (each bowl takes about 15 mins to make, they do it in front of you MORE WAITING), and then.......... I took my first bite.  Well, it was good. Pretty good actually- but not mind blowing. Spicy level 4 suited me ( meduim spice lover), and it was blisteringly hot. The more I ate, the better I felt, and the more I liked it, but it was a big bowl and I was reallllly tired so I only made a small dent. I ended up taking 3/4 of the food home ($30 pan roast why not?) even though I figured it was get thrown in the trash the next morning when we went to brunch somewhere else.  This is when the funny thing happened. Had I wrote that review that night, Osyter Bar was 3.5 star experience for me. The next morning, I had a few bites of the left overs and it was a 4. Three days later, back home from vacation, I crave it. No joke! I want to fly back there to eat it again. RIGHT NOW.  So, Osyter bar, you got me- a soild 5 and bewilderment from me, but 5 you get.  So that is my story. Maybe there's crack in there, or maybe it a tough sell that grows on you over time. All I know is, you all need to try it. Next time I go, it's sneakers, folding chair, and sweatpants.",

On average the wait is at least an hour. I like to show up at 10:45am on weekdays. (Your welcome)   I love the Pan Roast Combo- it comes with lobster,crab,shrimp & white rice. I like to order it at level 4/5 spicy.  Something about the creamy broth of this soup is out of this word. I generally get a half dozen oysters as well. If you love Seafood you will love this place. I try to come here a couple times a year. Honestly I go all the time just to check the line.    They do not do Phone or To go orders. You must be seated and you also must be 21 years of age !   If you have time to patiently wait I would recommend trying it just for the experience.",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I came here around 2pm and the wait was about 45 minutes to an hour. This restaurant only consists of a bar with around 18 seats so you can see why there is quite an intense wait around here. There were 3 parties in front of us and we had an issue with a lady who cut the line right in front of us and was served. When we brought it up, the manager quickly came out, apologized and offered a round of free drinks and a generous 20% off the tab.  They provide complimentary dinner rolls with butter. I tried a sip of the shandy and consumed the shipwreck which tasted like strawberry ginger beer and lime juice. It was pretty good. My friend opted for a shrimp cocktail starter instead of a drink and it came with 5 jumbo shrimp with cocktail and horseradish sauce.  Between three girls, we shared the linguine and clam and the combo pot roast that came with rice at spicy level 3 (the spicy meter goes from 1-10). The linguine was more liquidy than I expected - more like a stew and a little too salty. The pot roast was delicious and creamy - I can definitely see why it's a crowd favorite.  All in all, the service is well attentive and it's a decent place to try at least once for the pot roast but there's only so long you can wait around for this place - try odd eating hours or their happy hours between 1-9am for a possibly shorter wait.",

It's not because there's a ton of people in line, but it's because there's only like 12 or 15 seats available at the oysters bar. But it is really worth it as soon as you take the first bite. The chef (I think he's Filipino) is awesome! Super generous and friendly.   I was starving.. my bf and I ordered two dishes: one palace station pan roast and the other clam linguine. Wow their clam linguine is seriously the best I've had. Tons and tons of clams in the dish.. he was definitely generous and was not shady with it!! And of course, the pan roast is always good!!  Can't wait to go back to Vegas.",

    "text": "I love this place. Every time I visit Vegas, I almost always have to eat here. Sometimes even twice within one Vegas trip.  There are only 18-20 seats at the bar. You cannot order to-go unless you've been seated first. I asked them when theyre least busiest, they said 6-8:30 am. I usually end up here about 3 or 4 am and the wait is still 30 minutes to an hour long to be seated; then you have to wait for them to take your order and prepare the food. It's definitely worth the wait because everything smells and tastes amazing!  What I've eaten here: Oysters: 5/5 very fresh! Half dozen oysters for $10 on moonlight special from 1 am - 9 am. Combo Pan Roast $23.99: 5/5 tomato stew w/ shrimp, crab, lobster. Pick the spiciness level; I usually get a 4. You can hardly taste the tomato base; my mom doesn't like tomato base stuff but truly enjoyed this pan roast. It's difficult for 1 person to finish one of these and I think they charge about $6 for sharing. However, if you order something $10 or more for the second person, you can avoid the charge. Bouill-roast $23.99: 4/5 seafood stew w/ clams, mussels, shrimp. I prefer the pan roast! Clam Chowder; cup $5.99; bowl $8.99: 5/5 hands down the best clam chowder I've ever had! Every bite had clams in it. Not too much potatoes.  They peel and devein the shrimp, shuck the oysters. Only one guy cooking at the bar. Sitting at the bar is great because you can see the hard work that goes into cooking these pan roasts and other dishes. Don't try to sit at the bar if the seat is empty and the bar hasn't been wiped down. The employees will yell at you.  When you're ready to take leftovers home, they'll put it in a styrofoam container for you and then Saran Wrap it. I managed to bring the pan roast home twice; successfully passed TSA without them opening it up. I wish i could have taken the clam chowder home but I worry that would've been confiscated.",

Looking back at it, it was worth it. You gotta be In good company though. We got there around 12ish and didn't sit till almost 2:30 meaning people in the back of the line probably weren't gonna eat till 5am.. that blows my mind thank God I had a lot of time to spare. It's just a counter, maybe sits 15 people from what I remember but the workers are fast. You can't realy rush to eat bc your whole mouth will burn right off but man that line never went down. I think her name was Heather? she was a doll and she was so quick to answer everything with a smile. They make the food right in front of you and everyone is so friendly.  I decided on the Pan Roast Combo level6. I was feeling it the next morning for sure. I would definitely make it a point to come back on my next trip.",

Lol   We get there and notice there's hardly a line after reading reviews of the line being long all the time. It's no wonder because the last person in line let us know they were the last ones they were taking because they were closing for their general cleaning they have once a month.  We were so bummed until an employee came out to let us know they were closed but we managed to get in because we let them know we were leaving the next day. So they gave my significant other the duty of letting others know that tried to stand in line after us they were closing for 6 hours...boy there were a lot of unhappy people! Yippee..... We were so grateful and excited to eat! Lol  The first thing I notice is they have Anchor Steam on tap...my fave San Francisco beer...I was on that! I also ordered a vodka shot...yummy! That just made everything better! He ordered the shrimp cocktail which were huge pieces and came on a bed of lettuce and cocktail sauce and horseradish. I had to have the gumbo because the last time I had home made gumbo was when my aunt Geline made some a long while back. I'm so happy I did because I ordered the HOUSE GUMBO and was in heaven after my first spoon! OMG there's no words to describe how delicious it was...you just have to try it yourself! My other half ordered the Combo Pan Roast and added lobster. He looked like he was in heaven as well after his first taste.  The customer service was outstanding! Thanks Jill for being so awesome with us. This girl deserves a raise...her work ethics and customer service is outstanding!  We were lucky enough to have soup this night and will definitely be back regardless of the line we have to wait in. It'll definitely be worth the wait! I wish I had some gumbo right now!!!",

The house pan roast was bland. Ive had pan roast from Reno (home of pan roast) and it wasnt even close. This pan roast was like a seafood tikka masala.  Buttery, sweet, thick. Not much other flavor though.  Except for that one shrimp that was half gone. Thats awesome.  The cioppino is no better than the tourist crap at Fishermans Wharf (San Francisco).  The Gumbo was waaaay to salty.  The oysters were big and meaty.  A bit earthy tasting.  Not my cup of tea.  The oyster origins are not stated, they told me they were from Louisiana.    The server (yes one guy!) was fast and friendly.  Hats off to this guying for dealing with the late night shit show that is this place .  He was literally feeding the animals.  The one cook is busy cooking 6 meals at a time. Thats right.  He can only cook 6 pots at any given time.  So be patient.    Overal I'd say that this place is NOT worth the wait.  We were seriosuly dissappointed after so many \"elites\" said this place was a must try.  Those ELITES  must try to eat better.",

It's literally a bar, and they only seat 18, so be prepared to do your due diligence and stand in line.  Or you can have an awesome friend stand in line for the group while you grab a drink, play some slots or blackjack until you're seated.  TRUST ME, it's worth the wait!!!  And that's coming from someone who NEVER waits in line for food.    You really don't come here for the oysters, you come here for the combo pan roast.  Don't get me wrong, the dozen oysters we ordered were fresh and on point (from Louisiana I think...), but there's plenty of other places to get fresh oysters.  I wasn't too crazy about the mussels but it was worth a try.  The chef cooks directly in front of where you're seated, so you get a bird's eye view of the action.  I noticed many of the guests are regulars, so they must know how amazing the food is here.  The combo pan roast...bomb diggity!  I only got it level 6 spiciness (probably could have gone with a level 8), but WOW, I was blown away!!  Creamy, spicy, tons of flavor mixed with shrimp, crab, and lobster!  The portions are huge, and I promise you will be extremely satisfied afterwards.  It's a shame they have such a small seating area and they don't take orders to go; if you are ordering to go, you have to stand in line anyways, so I guess it makes sense.  But goodness, expand this place would ya!!  Whenever I'm in Vegas again, this will definitely be on my top places to visit.  Good thing they're open 24/7!",

According to Ricardo (chef), the combo pan roast, gumbo and bouillabaisse are their top three orders. We opted for the combo pan roast and bouillabaisse on our first visit. The portions are generous and well worth the ~$25!   The combo pan roast is so tasty! Flavorful, rich, creamy lobster based stew with lots of shrimp, crab and lobster meat. I can eat a tub of rice with this sauce. I never had a bouillabaisse before so I have nothing to compare to. But I am sure theirs is definitely one of the best.   Friendly service! I highly recommend giving this place a try despite the somewhat long wait. Good food deserves a little wait!",

Yes, it really IS a bar meaning that there are only 18 seats so be courteous to other customers and once you're done pleaseeee leave! My bf grabbed his bread and ate it while we were walking around the casino because he didn't want others to wait.   They start you off with a sour dough roll and some butter. Feel free to ask for more if you want.   The portions are very big, prices range from $19-24 for a bowl but its worth the price. I ordered the Alaskan clam chowder which came with chunks of lobster, 3-4 jumbo shrimp and a bunch of crab. It was SOOO GOOD. The clam chowder wasn't watered down like other places that I've been to. It was very creamy. I only finished about 1/3 of the bowl, literally every bite I took had lobster chunks. It was great.   My bf ordered the gumbo and he enjoyed it, saying it was the best he's had. His only regret was that he got it mild and should have gotten a spice level of at least 5-6.  Service was ok. I wish they had a better system then just having customers stand in a line for hours.",

I'm very big on Texture and this was not too thick and the correct consistency! If your pan roast is as thick as my rice then no! I added extra habanero for extra spicy because i love my food spicy!   Diablo with linguine: delicious. I togo the rest and finished it.   Alaskan clam chowder: omfg so so good. Best clam chowder hands down! Not even San Francisco can make clam chowder as good!!  Gold Band Oysters- thick meat and super fresh. Boiling crab uses the same except they have fresh ones out more often.   Would I come back? Umm yes!!!!",

    "text": "This is another place that has been on my list for waaaay too long and I'm only finally getting around to it. Don't worry, I'm totally kicking myself.   Ugh, why is it so freaking good?! I HATE waiting in line. It's such a colossal waste of time. That's why I'm all about optimizing on \"slow\" times. Of course, it's unpredictable, but I've witnessed NO LINE (I couldn't believe it either) and during my last visit, our wait was just 45 minutes. It would have been 25 minutes, but a small oversight on the part of the server increased our wait. Also, it's obviously easier with smaller parties. Stick to a party of two or dining solo. There are just 18 seats and turnaround is approximately an hour. BTW, you still need to wait in line to order takeout.  Lump Crab Cocktail ($15.99): You don't often find crab cocktails like you would shrimp cocktails, so we wanted to change it up. The lump crab is delicious and is accompanied with lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, and horseradish. Everything is fantastic together.  Palace Pan Roast ($23.99): Shrimp, Crab, Chicken, and Andouille Sausage. All their Pan Roasts feature fresh seafood sauteed with Brandy, Cream, and Tomato and served with steamed rice. Yowzers!! This dish is incredibly flavorful and rightfully popular. You'll wonder where it's been all your life. You'll daydream about running through fields hand-in-hand. The Combo Pan Roast is definitely appealing with shrimp, crab, and lobster, but I love the addition of chicken and Andouille sausage. The only crustacean missing is lobster or you could always add lobster for $7.99 and have it all! The pan roast is really rich and rather heavy, but you won't regret a single bite. The portion is generous, so you'll likely have leftovers or could share (keep in mind they charge $5-6 for shared plates).  Bouillabaisse ($23.99): Classic French Stew with Onions, Celery, Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Cod, Mussels, and Clams. All your sea friends came to play in this light, fragrant broth. This is wonderful choice if you're looking for a lighter dish.  There is a choice of heat level (1-10) on all the dishes. Since the pan roasts have a lot of cream, it absorbs the heat really well. I ordered my pan roast with Level 3 and the heat barely registered. I know it's all relative, but I'm somewhat sensitive to spiciness, so this was rather mellow. I believe they use chili pepper flakes for heat, so you should be able to add more if you order conservatively.  Although very busy, service was great. Our server was anticipatory with our beverages which I appreciated very much. The chefs have been here for almost as long as the Oyster Bar has been open (they just made 20 years!), so they are masters at making these amazing seafood creations. It's such a great atmosphere with wonderful food. I'm itching to return!",

We dipped the bread in the broth afterwards   Main entrees: *Pan roast (4.5 stars): This is the MUST TRY of the menu.  It's so flavorful and creamy.  We ordered ours at a spicy level of 4.  Enough spice for a kick, but not to the point where it burns uncomfortably.     *Etouffle (3.5 stars): This dish was good, but it wasn't the favorite for our group.  Since the flavor is lighter than the pan roast, it didn't compare after trying the pan roast first.",

There are only about 12 seats so get there early cause your going to have to wait.    Service: Solid, only one waiter and one cook usually.  They are working hard.",

The staff is very friendly, the only downfall is that service is slow but that is due to them always having three people on duty.  When you are in Vegas you have to stop by for their Roast.",

    "text": "My review is not based solely from the food but the whole experience of the restaurant, starting from the wait. This restaurant, although I don't know if a place this small should even be called a restaurant, has a LONG WAIT. By long I mean a few hours maybe. Do not be deceived by the seemingly short line. Since there are only a handful seats, it takes forever for your turn to come around.  While waiting, you are going to suffer from the smoke and dirty carpets. I felt almost itchy and disgusted waiting in line since the restaurant is placed right in the middle of a casino floor. There isn't even a proper door or sectional to divide the restaurant from the casino. I started having headache from breathing in the pungent air for such a long time.  As for the food, yes they are good because there is a ton of seafood in there. But I didn't feel like it was special to the extent that you would wait hours for this in such a terrible environment. The portions are huge, so definitely share it with someone. There is no way you could even finish half of the food by yourself.  The service of the restaurant is pretty bad. There is a \"chef\" who cooks and there is a server/chef who does everything from cleaning the tables, cooking the food at times, serving the drinks and food, bringing you the check. So evidently, this person is super busy. You have to wait for him to come close to you to ask for more drink or even your check. Also, while we were eating the chef got frustrated and said things to the \"server\". This just made everything super uncomfortable for me because it is a complete open kitchen.   Vegas has so many great restaurants. DO NOT COME HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DURING YOUR TRIP.  Maybe, if you have a ton of time and want to have a lot of seafood for the cheap price and live in Vegas or something, then I guess this restaurant could be good for you.   I WOULD NEVER RETURN HERE EVER AGAIN.  DISGUSTING AIR CONDITIONS.",

The oysters get a 2 rating for me. They do not clean the oysters besides a quick rinse. Good oyster bars typically scrub their shells before serving it to patrons, but this one did not. I received very gritty and dirty half shells. They also do not tell you where heir oysters hail from. Only get oysters here if you want some large and meaty and don't care about the nuances of oyster flavors.   Definitely stick with the gumbo or pan roast. The flavors are well developed. Each dish is cooked to order. You know the chef is serious when each ingredient is timed so that nothing is overdone. Plan to share if you don't have a big appetite.",

Last night I definitely had my worst experience after coming several times b4.  I give it 3 stars cause the wait is always too long! And takes about another 20-30 mins b4 you get your order, depending on how long you take to decide what you want so could take longer. And they are in no rush to make it move faster not by even taking Togo orders of clam chowder that's always already made! Pissed me off once I seen them go in the pot full of already made clam chowder after asking for Togo and waiting another 20 mins just to get it.  I went to gamble a little to give up my seat to the next feet hurting woman that stood in line for hours as well. Came back to get my meal.. just to get home and find out I got cheated on my clam chowder. Last time I came they filled my cup up! Which I only got the $3.99 cup- This time it was half full and I paid for the $8.99 bowl! So I guess it depends on who serves you. Cause why give me a big ass cup half full. I rather eat there then get it Togo cause my hubby cup was more then what I started with for his leftovers when we 1st tried it. Either the guy was upset I decided to take it Togo he didn't even offer me water which others were seated after me got  yeah didn't get his name but I remember what he looks like an ill update this later. Other then him the other staff is great! Two thumbs up.",

That's nearly 4 hours folks.  The couple in front of me joked that we could have flown to NYC in that time and had a round of oysters in the same amount of time.  I swear when the waitress told us to sit down I felt like we had won the Olympics. -1 star.    We each had a dozen oysters, and our waitress didn't shuck them completely, so the oyster was still attached by that membrane thingie.  This made slurping impossible, so we had to use the little fork to pry 24 oysters out of its shell.  - 1 star.    Then we had to wait for the pan roast to be completed.  The chef was not exactly speedy gonzalez.  Granted he only had 6 steamers to work with, but when we realized half the people weren't eating we sank into deeper depression.  Yes the pan roast was delicious.  But it wasn't knock me over delicious.  I think we were so green by that time, nothing could be THAT delicious.    If there was less of a wait, and if this restaurant was more centrally located, I might consider going back.  But since this place is an actual out of the way destination, and that the wait time is always bad no matter what time of day, I can't say that I will be back anytime soon.",

We waited for about an hours and fourth five mins. Sheesh. But it was worth it.   Ordered a dozen oysters. They were fresh. The man cracked it open in front of us. I ordered the pan roast #8 spicy which consist of lobster, crab, shrimp with a scoop of white rice. My BF ordered the Alaskan clam chowder #8 spicy which consist of clams, lobster, and shrimp. We love spices so #8 was perfect for us. The texture and taste were on the spot.   I recommend going with only up to 4 people to try this place unless you want to wait for a very long time. Or get seated at different times. It will alway be busy so no point on leaving and coming back.",

Nice for us to watch the actual cleaning of the Oysters and Seafood and cooking in front of us. We were lucky it wasn't swamped when we went at 1:45 AM due to travel scheduling and Waitress Jill was very fast as well, not much wait to be seated. The Lobster Dish takes a bit longer than expected, as the Dozen Oysters Platter, Crab Appetizer and New England Clam Chowder are delicious but much faster.  But this food is fresh, the company and ambiance close and they answered every single question about the menu and preparation as well as possible with a full bar. Interesting locale, excellent food, and quality service. Try this place ! You might become a huge fan !! Huge Thanks for quelling our appetites on a late Tuesday night, from Tamara & Patrick",

For the duration I was there, there was always a group waiting.  I got there at 8pm and had to wait about an 45 min, but the line had down by 9pm.  The biggest problem is that there are only 17 seats, which are stools that circles around the bar.  The food is amazing and fun to watch, they are made in these stainless steel steamers that look like something from a steam punk engine and are located in the center of the bar.  I got the House Pan Roast spicy level 7 with extra lobster.  The lobster though was rubbery and tasted just like shrimp.  Next time I'd get extra crab.  At any rate, it was delicious and totally worth the wait.  The soup was thick and flavorful, like a really rich spicy gumbo that went well with rice.  I'd also like to try noodles next time too. I would totally go here if they had one in LA.",

Hats of to them and thanks for making our first visit so fun, memorable and appetizing. Cajon Shrimp, Caesar salad, Gumbo were all worth coming back for...bravo!",

    "text": "Walked inside Palace Station and did not expect to find a restaurant that merely consists of a bar situated right outside the casino floor.  Being such small establishment with seating less than 20 people at a time, I can definitely see why everyone whines about the long wait.  Fortunately, we opted for a nontraditional breakfast which turned out to be a great idea as the place was completely empty around 7am.  They do offer a daily Moonlight Special from 1am to 9am with $2.00 16oz Bud Light drafts, $5.00 wines and $8.99 1/2 dozen oysters so I wouldn't be surprise if there happened to be a line that early in the morning.  One thing I don't understand is why not expand into a bigger location considering how big their clientele is.  At least this way, they can focus on customer service and preserve such exceptional food quality.  Speaking of food, everything we had was quite tasty!!  I ended up ordering the etouffee while she had the palace pan roast.  Obviously, seafood isn't fresh off the boat that morning but at least they actually cook it in front of their guests so you know what they serve hasn't been simmering in their kitchen for days.  My dish had great Cajun flavors synonymous with a typical etouffee from NoLa.  I like how the seafood was perfectly cooked and not rubbery at all.  They also didn't skimp out on ingredients, especially lobsters, so paying $22 for a bowl of soup was totally worth it!!  Overall, Oyster Bar is a must for visitors and locals alike.  Check this place out during off peak hours (early mornings/late nights) to avoid waiting for a long time just to get seated!!  Since they're open 24/7 this would actually be a great ending to a long night of debauchery especially with the Happy Hour being so late.",

Had to get the Combo Pan Roast again- this time with a 6 on the spicy scale and for me it was the perfect kick without being uncomfortable. Just as good as the first time- amazing!  We also tried the Alaskan Claim Chowder and it is one loaded chowder! Plenty of clams, shrimp, lobster mixed in with the creamy, comforting, flavorful soup. This actually goes really well with the pan roast because it is a milky type of creaminess, while the pan roast has more of a tomatoey flavor.   Can't wait for the next time!",

    "text": "It's day 3 of EDC.  I feel defeated.  The only thing that I want is something warm and comforting and lo and behold, I stumble across this Yelp listing.  A beacon of light in my post-EDC haze.  The reviews all warn a 2-3hour wait, but boyfriend and I were optimistic (how?).  It's not going to happen to us, we're going to get there and we're going to EAT.  So we pumped ourselves up to put on actual clothes and trekked our way off the strip and back into the 1980's.  The Palace Station is definitely not the place to be seen, but it houses this magnificent gem.  You find it by looking for the massive line of hungry, salivating people.   When all of the seats are taken, it really does take the predicted two hours before you'll get served, so prepare to wait.  We did.  But it was OH. SO. WORTH. IT.  Get the pan roast.    This was one of the best things I've ever eaten.    If you're here with a friend, don't even think about trying anything else.  Just get two orders of pan roast.  You'll end up fighting over it.  And definitely get one to go too so you can take it home and eat it when you're hung over.  Imagine the creamiest tomato soup with all of your favorite seafood served over rice and that's what the pan roast is.  The ultimate comfort food, upgraded.  My mouth is watering.    And if you're reading this as you're waiting in line... DON'T GIVE UP, YOU ARE SO CLOSE!  And if you are my friend or even an acquaintance who has my phone number, please get me an order of pan roast and I will venmo you when you get back to the 'dale.",

    "text": "We had a wonderful experience at Oyster Bar today! I was so pleasantly surprised by everything, especially since this was an unplanned visit. I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile, and today wound up being that day, all because we were trying to avoid the traffic on the 15 FWY. We were cruising down Martin Luther Blvd. debating what to grab for dinner, when right there before our eyes was the glittering Palace Station lights. On a whim we remembered Oyster Bar and decided to drop by.   Apparently the wait for this place is insane, but we waited a whopping 5 minutes! I'm not really sure how that happened. Maybe Tuesday 5 PM is the trick? The only real waiting was for the food, but it was well worth it. We ordered the Bouillabaisse. If you're unapologetically American and can't speak French, join the club. It's pronounced something like \"Bull Yeah Baes.\" The guys working the counter are super nice so they won't care, but just in case you want to look like you eat French cuisine on the daily. :P So the Bouillabaisse was delicious. Lots of different seafoods (lobster, crab, clam, etc.) in a rich delicious broth with rice on the side. We also ordered the Lobster Pan Roast, another scrumdidlyumpitious creamy stew with huge chunks of lobster swimming. We subbed the rice for noodles. Oh my gosh, I loved it more. But I love pasta. Both dishes were rich and complex. I love getting foods like this - something I can't ever make to such perfection at home.   While it takes awhile for the food to arrive, we had a lot of fun watching the Chef work his magic. He had such a flair for cooking, it was like watching an artist create masterpieces before our eyes. I enjoyed watching him sprinkling dashes of this and that into the simmering hot pots, flipping the stews into fresh bowls, whisking seafood left and right. Made me even happier when I realized 2 of the pots were ours.   Overall it was a great experience. We were lucky we didn't have to wait long. I'm not even sure we would've come here if we had known beforehand that the waits here are long. But now we know, and we would still come back, because the food and service are that good!",

They are sooooooo plump and fresh and each oyster is served with its own lemon wedge (whaaaaaat?)  I have a friend from Texas who is a Vegas regular. Her husband has been coming to Vegas since he was 13 years old and every year since he turned 21, he comes to Vegas for his birthday. They always make it a point to stop by the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station for the infamous Pan Roast. The Oyster Bar has become a Vegas tradition for me as well and is truly a hidden Las Vegas gem that I hope will continue for many years to come.",

There's less of a wait around 2am since everyone's probably busy at all the night clubs. I came super early one morning and there was no wait at all since everyone is probably sleeping, gambling or hung over. I usually order pan roast and a dozen oysters. They're oysters are so meaty and they're delicious! I always crave for some. I usually get a lot of spice in their pan roast and rice on the side.

OF course you go to the \"OYSTER BAR\"!!!  There was no wait so we just walked up to the bar. Ricardo was our chef/cook and buddy for the morning. He gave us a suggestion and we ordered Seafood Pan Roast (along the line of a Bisque but thicker with Crab, Lobster and Shrimp). We also ordered a dozen Oysters, Clams and Mussels and every single bite was the bomb.   We've had Oysters before and hate it when parts of the shell gets onto the Oyster! But the ones at the Oyster Bar was just so fresh so clean! Ricardo was quick to open the shell and serve us. With a squeeze of lemon and shot of Tobasco it goes down so smooth and it'll leave you wanting more. If we didn't order other stuff we probably would have ordered another dozen.  The clams/mussels cooked in it's own juices was GR8! You can't go wrong with this order at all! Jeff wanted to just drink it's juice, that's how much he liked it.  As for the Pan Roast, it's #1 and we heard a few people say the same thing. Good thing we ordered it. You get a good amount of seafood, which you being cooked right in front of you. Not like in restaurants where they cook it in the back and all it contains is lots of soup base with very little seafood meat. We were full with just the oysters and order of clams & mussels, but couldn't put down the spoon because it was DEELLLIIICCCIIIOOOUUUSSSSS! It didn't look like we touched the bowl because we had to take home the rest of the portion.  Service is friendly and great! You'll end up chit chatting with other customers and the Chef. Food is great! Everything is great. Lets just say If you were having a bad day or lost $$ from the casino this will cheer you right up! Okay you will probably still be bummed u lost money but not while you're eating.  Oh and the Oyster Shooter is also a must try. We will definitely come back again and bring our friends.   It may be a long wait since seats are limited to maybe less than 20 (literally a strip of bar), but it'll be worth it.",

Didn't quite manned up but did try to eat some more. At the end he got his box to take togo.   Some of the customers asked the chef, \"Where does the Oysters come from?\" His reply, \"From the cooler.\"  Yeah, it's as good as it gets here!

They wiill cater the gumbo to meat only.  Sad that they ran out of oysters though.  Clam Chowder was the best I had, but wish it wasn't so thick.  Seafood Gumbo was amazing. Spicyness level 1 to 10. We got 8 and it was a very good amount of heat, but I can taste the seafood.  The seafood pasta was so delish too.   It's in a hotel off the strip that no one goes too and looks so old, but everyone comes here for Oyster Bar. AMAZING!!!",

There's no restaurant name, it's literally called \"oyster bar\" with less than 20 seats serving up tomato based broth with shellfish (shrimp, lobster, crab).  the pan roast, gumbo, and jambalaya totally steal the oyster's thunder here because it's pretty much what everyone orders.  Broth texture is creamy but not thick nor watery.  We had a 6 (1 thru 10) spicyness level and it wasn't spicy at all, so feel free to bump it up to a 9 or 10 if you want more chili pepper in there.",

The wait was about an hour during lunch time, which is not bad. They only had about 16 bar spaces so I don't recommend coming here with a large party. They only have one chef and one server for the entire bar. So the waiting time for the food might be long. We waited about 15 mins for our food.   We ordered:  1 dozen oysters (not the best that I've had but decent).  Shrimp & Lobster Fra Diablo (Sauteed shrimp and lobster in a spicy tomato sauce with linguine) = Amazingly good. There are about 8 or 9 jumbo shrimps and two large pieces of lobster. We ordered mild but I think it would be better to go for medium.  Of course we had to try the famous Pan Roast (fresh seafood sauteed with brandy, cream and tomato served with rice). We had the combo (shrimp, crab and lobster). This is a must try.. it was soooooo good. The portions are pretty big (it could be shared among 2 ppl) but they charge you $5 extra for sharing. Even though there's only 2 of us, we managed to finish all 3 items.... ;)  Can't wait to go back again the next time we visit Vegas.",

My bro and I thought we could handle a pan roast on our own but we no can handle since we chomped on a whole bunch of chowder prior.  In pan roast combo they put tons of seafood. A lump of crab, scallops, lobster tails, and more.  It creates such a rich broth that it's hard to eat it all.  Upside? We got seated right away since we ate at an off hour.    Lastly, I gotta comment. One customer didn't know what an oyster looked like. Also he was confused about what a scallop looked like in it's shell.  As well as mussels. I will just throw this out there.....understand the food that you eat.  Check out a market or a grocery store.  Food will taste much better and you'll appreciate it even more when you know where it comes from! :-) Da guy thought \"This food is exotic and only in Vegas\".....my fellow customer.....the food at the oyster bar could be found in many places in the world! I am glad the chef kindly educated him about the different seafood.  Check it out.  Go for the chowder!",

Many trips and 17 years later, I have always had a great dining experience and the food is absolutely amazing. I love the Combo Roast and Bulliabase with a side of pasta. The chefs and bar backs are warm, polite and aim to please. All of the dishes are fantastic. I highly recommend this place, obviously!  The only draw back, there is usually a line to get in. No problem, grab a drink and relax in the line.",

(that's gonna be my new saying for this year...randomly inserted \"I got this fam!\"'s haha)  So after a 10 hour drive taking us from Vegas to Hoover Dam to Grand Canyon and back, I was beat. We got to our rental and your boy took some medicine and ko'ed. This was approximately 8pm. I never sleep at 8pm. Anyway, I woke up this morning at 3am fully rested and what does any normal guy do at 3am? Crave for a Pan Roast from Oyster Bar of course!   While searching for must eats in Las Vegas, Yelp brought me to the Oyster bar, which is an 18 seat bar in an older, off the strip casino. I would have never thought that one of the best things I've ever tasted, like ever, would come from a place like this. Think of the scene in Goodfellas when Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci are joking around - smoky, dark, and old...that's Palace Station. But Oyster Bar is that diamond in the rough.  I got lucky in that from the reviews I've been reading, even at 5am the wait is like 2 hours. I got there around 3:30am and \"only\" had to wait 30 minutes.  We got seats next to a couple visiting from Germany (Danke!) and a local couple who told us how to order and what to get. The local couple told us to try the Oysters on a half shell and the shrimp etoufee, but if we were to only get one thing - get the Pan Roast. You can get it with just shrimp or just lobster or just crab or you can be a G like me and get the Combo which is all of that, AND add andoullie sausage for $5. The chef will ask you how hot you like it, being a newb I didn't want the heat to ruin it for me so I got it at a 3, which after eating it, I can tell you now is basically no heat. The proteins are put in a pot and chef adds what looks like tomato soup, cream, and spices, and adds a scoop of white rice and voila - BEST THING EVER AT 3AM. Has to be in the top 7 things I've ever eaten in my life.  Don't hesitate. It is really THAT GOOD. I'm going to rename the Pan Roast - Crack Soup. Get you some Crack Soup.   HBD to me. Yau Mo Gau Cho!",

They need to expand a bit and have more tables because they tend to have a long wait time due to the fact of the seating, or maybe a limit at the table because they were people just chilling after they were done Eating taking selfies smh. Wait time was 2 1/2 hours!!   We ordered the house gumbo cause we saw on yelp people suggested that and the pan roast combo. We also ordered a dozen of oysters. Oysters wasn't all that great it tasted gross. I've tasted better oysters at other places that are much more fresher and sweet tasting. The house gumbo came out good but I wouldn't go back and wait for that long just for that. Customer service was great I have no negative comment about our server. I'd give better ratings if there service was a lot faster by adding more chairs and tables.",

The staff at any shift -day, swing or graveyard- are consistent with each other -- all so personable and giving fast service. I love that we could watch the chef make the food right in front of you and/or socialize with the neighboring couples/groups, making the atmosphere so casual. I especially recommend the pan roast. While people I've taken with me here have preferred the Combo pan roast (shrimp, lobster and crab) or the palace pan roast (sausage, lobster, shrimp,  crab and chicken) , I feel like all the meats, etc. are too much so I settle for the crab pan roast! Make sure to come HUNGRY!",

It's like there isn't any soap here at oyster bar and not too many things get washed or cleaned. You'll probably cringe when you see the dirtiness of the kitchen and the work areas, but if you're able to ignore that, then you'll love this place.   When ever I'm here, I usually share the Palace Station pan roast and a dozen oysters.",

    "text": "If you love seafood such as clam chowder gumbo jambalaya oysters this is the place to go. I have yet to find a place that has a better New England clam chowder then the Oyster Bar at Palace station or even a better gumbo. The lines are always long if you go here on a weekend or late night or around lunch time even but if you find a time to get there before the lines get long I definitely would tell you to go there and get some good food. I love the fact that they cook the food in front of you using steam which is pretty neat and you get that smell and it just mad and makes you go crazy.  Since I'm a local I usually like to go there to order my food to go and bring it home and it still tastes just as amazing in a to go container as it does sitting there eating meat at the bar the casino itself out you know not too big of a fan of but that bar is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebomb.com&s=355187a2a784c6ee933e2e46feb84e4a2bbc84cde0736652fb6961a6a23327f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thebomb.com</a>.  They can be a little pricey if you aren't ready to spend about $15 per person but to me it's worth it every dollar and most times you have enough to take home so if you go there make sure you're either very hungry or have somewhere to store the rest of your food because you're going to be mad if you can't eat it all and don't have anywhere to put the leftovers cuz you're going to want on the next day it's just that good.",

Yes, it might be located at Palace Station, but do not judge where the location is, the food here is mouth watering! Open 24/7! Can't go wrong with that! Seating is very LIMITED! The line and wait time can be pretty crazy, but if you are really a huge fan of tasting new places this is the place to go!   What I ordered was the lobster pan roast with pasta and lobster gumbo with rice. The lobster was FRESH and thick! The pan roast was like tasting tomato soup with a kick in it! WARNING: There is cream in the pan roast for the lactose people...(I asked for a 7 for spice level, but the cook told me to go a little under so I went with 6. I am thankful that I did that! Lol! Drank like 4 glasses of water and tried to eat bread to balance it out!) The gumbo was light and delightful! You can't go wrong with these two!  The service here is wonderful! Five stars! If they had ten stars, I would definitely give it to them! The cook that we had was named Bob and the server was named Delora. The cook was very sweet and friendly! He liked to joke around and made everyone feel welcomed and at home! The server was great! I asked for more bread and she gave me like five of them instead of one and we were just joking around the whole time! I felt like we known these people for a long time, even though, it was my first time trying it!  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE! =)  P.S. The sister chain, which is located in Chino Hills, The Broiler, is by far an imitation of this place! Since The Oyster Bar is the original location!   Also, I think this place is only 21 years and older, because they cook with alcohol. =/",

I know they are famous for their pan roast - but my boyfriend and I favor more of a broth like broth vs creamy.  OMG everything was so amazing!  I was afraid of how large the oysters were because normally the ones I've had tasted off, but these were SO SWEET.  The new england clam chowder was of course very creamy and comforting.  And lastly, the Bouillabase was mouthwatering delicious!  The broth was so flavorful and there were so many chunks of seafood - fish, crab, scallop, and shrimp!

There are only 15 seats to this bar, so waiting time can range from 1-3 hours. Worth the wait though!!",

We ended up splitting to 2 and 3 seats so that we could get seated quicker. There is one chef who does all the cooking and one server as well.   honestly, the food was amazing!! Pan roast, shrimp/crab cocktail, and their secret menu dish. I got the spicy level 7 for the secret menu. It came with seafood and was more of a soup base. Pan roast is more creamy. They both come with rice. They are sooooooo good!!! For the shrimp crab cocktail, they mixed it together in a shredded way. You must try that as well :)  Oh yeah, their bloody mary is delicious too! Try the drink and you can see how they make it..:)",

    "text": "Worth every minute of wait! We were visiting Vegas and after seeing the yelp reviews, we knew we couldn't pass up not trying this place out. As some have pointed, the place only sits 15 people. It gets tricky when there are large parties in front of you (4+ or more) because when seats open up, they don't seat smaller parties and they will essentially wait until more seats open up to seat the people in front. Hence, this adds up to the wait. We waited for 1 hr and 30 minutes during early lunch time.  Now for the food!! We started with the 1/2 dozen oysters and man were they fresh! The sizes of the oysters were bigger than I anticipated but we are definitely complaining.   I got the combo pan roast and my SO got the bouill-roast. If you like richer sauce get the pan roast and for a lighter version get the bouill-roast. The combo pan roast was creamy and they do not shy away from the seafood portion. Every scoop was accompanied by shrimp, crab and lobster. No searching for what you ordered in the bowl!   If you have the time and patience to wait in line, I say go for it. Skip the line by going during early hours or late at night, they are open 24 hours! Highly recommend and we will definitely be coming back again!",

You have to brave a line that can last up to 2.5 hours during dinner time, but if you are able to be patient, then you will be rewarded with some of the most delicious pan roast filled with delicious lobster and crab. The creamy, tomato base with just the right amount of spice (you choose your own level) pairs perfectly with the fresh seafood that is cooked perfectly and is tender and absorbs all the flavors of the delicious base.  Like others have suggested, try the lobster pan roast and add crab (or double lobster) to get the most bang for your buck (unless you really love shrimp, then just get the combo), get the rice on the side, and tons of rolls to soak up the deliciousness!  Enjoy! And charge that phone before you go!",

Finished eating at 730 pm. The Bouillabaisse, spicy level 4 was mild and was not as creamy like the pan roast, but still excellent. The Seafood Jambalaya, spicy level 4 was mild  and different than New Orleans style. It had more of a tomato sauce base to it which I do not like. I like it more with a Gumbo base to it. It was still a great time watching the cook EZE entertain us with his cooking of the foods from the bar chairs. Once in a great while I would wait for this kind of food as I can go to the other station casinos and get similar foods with no wait. After 10 pm I saw the line die down to 2 people in line.",

They run things very smoothly, the reason it's such a long wait is because of the lack of seating. You are eating at a bar/kitchen counter.  I order the combo pan roast and it was delicious! 10/10 would recommend. The price is around $25, and it is worth every penny! The seafood is fresh, plump, and flavorful. The amount of seafood you get is more than enough. I almost didn't finish my Pan roast, but I didn't want to reheat seafood so I decided to reward my taste buds and finish the plate!  Only downside is the wait.",

I'm not easily impressed at all ( whoopsies) and have had way more than my share of seafood. Afterall, I pride myself on having that 80% seafood diet life long. The other 20 is noodles, coffee and meat. Totally a fair share!  The wait~ it gets longer and longer as the it get deeper into the weekend. My first visit was the shortest wait and my second was the longest! My third was the middle since we came in between meals!! Didn't tell my girlfriends how long the wait was but they forgave me once they had the food :D  Yes it's that good.   What's good?? Everything! I love their oysters! Clams on half shells is definitely my favorite. They are so big here!!   Gumbo: this is what I came for! All 3 times: it was magic!!! Oh so magic!!   And that Lava sauce.   I got my food with 10 stars spice. Wasn't hot enough so I chatted up with the friendly chef Roberto! He decided to make me this 10 habaneros and serranos concoction! All simmered down!! And oh so tasty!!!   Needless to say: my every visits after involved 10 stars spice for everything plus a few lava bowls!! Like literally had lava bowl challenge. So much so that they now gave me a nickname: Miss Lava!! Got little hearts with Lava written all over on my orderssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss! How cute is that!  People get very antsy and demanding from the wait. Even quite rude. My rule is never to be rude to people that serve me or do things for me. I mean come on!!! They are trying way too hard to give you an epic meal!! Why you gotta be so rude?!!   As I waited patiently for my dozen clams, oysters, oysters shooters in patron ( this was a ok), I chatted up with another chef! Or talk for a good 2 hours rather! Ramonnnnn: you are the best, sir!! Thanks for making my meals the best food experiences!! Your gumbo is pretty epic too!  I got to try the house clam chowder! Moscow mules! And pastaaaaaaaaaa! I really wanted that pasta while I struggle to finish 1/3 of my amazing gumbo. The chef totally hooked me up :) Never had such an entertaining or fun meal! Did I mention how crazy busy they were. Kindness totally gets me. And everyone here was beyond kind. Thanks Crystina and Ramon! And Ezeeeeeeeeee! Oh yea Christopher too! You guys rock my socks! And our tastebuds! We were focused more on getting food from here than partying throughout our vegas trip! Just magic!!! Mucha gracias, Ramon!",

One, I hate standing in line for food, and two, I was almost certain that there was no way this place could live up to all the hype.   When I arrived the line wasn't too bad and we were seated in about 30 minutes. I suppose 6pm on a Tuesday evening turned out to be a decent time to arrive. I ordered the combo pan roast, bouillabaisse and 6 oysters. I also ordered a beer for good measure.   The food arrived and I was in heaven. Each bite was perfection and I was already plotting a return visit two bites in.",

Bob, the man who has 17 years under his belt at whipping up dishes so mouth-watering that you curse every place that tries to copy it and fails miserably. I'm calling you out Oyster Bar SKC in SD! With your measly 3 shrimp and thin broth. No bueno dude. Speaking of which, our waitress told us they were affiliated with Oyster Bar in Las Vegas' Palace Station which is not True. Both Bob and Margie confirmed that they work for the hotel and that there is absolutely no affiliation whatsoever. And it shows!! I told Bob he needs to train the \"chefs\" at SKC and he laughed loudly. I love the sassy banter as always and you can tell lots of heart goes into his cooking.   We also found out that one of their former counterparts opened up shop in Los Angeles, under the name Ritter's. We are planning to visit only so we can wear our \"Oyster Bar Palace Station\" shirts and check out his restaurant, lol. There is no bad blood between them though so we promised to send our love from Bob and Margie to Mr. Ritter himself if we have the great pleasure of meeting him. :)  What we had: our usual Pan Roast Combo which is chock-full of lobster, crab and shrimp, served in a brandy cream tomato sauce that is so delicious that we took the leftovers, froze them, and re-heated them with cocktail shrimp when we got home. LOL! Not the same but we just couldn't bear to waste it.   The best time, for us at least, to go without waiting an hour plus is between 6AM and 11AM. Yes, that early...hope you like a big breakfast in your belly. Go anytime aside from these hours and can guarantee you will be waiting forever; it is that good. Parking is plentiful during that time too. Bonus!  Get your pan roast fix today! 5 glorious stars x 10.",

    "text": "I've heard so much about oyster bar, and many friends have said it has the best pan roast ever. I'm here to report that everything you may have heard is True (including the infamous wait times unfortunately, haha).  The palace pan roast is the best pan roast/gumbo/seafood stew/soup I've ever had. It beats any bouillabaisse, chowder, or other seafood soup I've ever had. Hands down, far and away, there is no comparison.  The flavor permeates your mouth. You will want to continue eating far past the point of being full. I had to walk away from my seat (literally) - that was the only way to stop eating it. It was warm, hearty, complex, delicate, and just simply perfection in a bowl. The Oyster Bar has captured lightning in a bottle. All of the ingredients come together to form a masterpiece. The brandy, cream, and tomato must go through a magical steam cooking process, because the result is accomplished, mesmerizing, and impeccable. It truly is something you must try for yourself in order to experience the phenomenon. . As I was chowing down, I must've eaten five or six shrimp. As I enjoyed each tender, succulent, meaty piece, I stopped to count how many were left. There were six more! I lost track, but there had to have been at least eleven decent sized shrimp in the pan roast. There was an abundance of sausage as well, which was very delicious and hearty. The crab was a little harder to find, but there was plenty of chicken.  I ordered spice level 3 (on a level of 1-10, with 10 being the most spicy). I'm the type of person that usually doesn't eat spicy food. I will eat spicy Korean soft tofu soup, for example, because it's much better that way. If you're a seasoned spice eater, you will want to get 6 or 7 at least, if not higher. The level 3 provided a slight kick for me, and wasn't too spicy.  Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino in Las Vegas.  Line information:  I asked the employees several questions regarding the line and here's what I can report to you. You are allowed to have one person stand in line for a larger group, as long as the entire party is present when you're called. I waited in line so my four friends could gamble (one joined me halfway through the wait). When we got close to the front, I called the rest of them to come over. We went at about 11:30pm on a Wednesday night, and got seated around 12:30am. I would say the slower times are morning and afternoon. This place is open 24 hours a day, and it seems to be busier at night time.  I will make it a point to come here every time I go to Vegas. I want to try the gumbo, etouffee, and bouillabaisse. The problem is that the pan roast was so great that I might not want to deviate from it. I would travel to Vegas solely for the intent and purpose of eating here! I'll be back as soon as I can. In the meantime, I'll have to search southern California for comparable pan roasts.",

    "text": "This updated review has been sitting in my drafts forever. If it wasn't for fellow Yelper Dave F., suggesting I give this place a try I would've never known that this place existed. So thank you Dave!   I've been back a few times since my first review. Each time I was not disappointed. The wait is long but oh well, sometimes in life wonderful things are worth waiting for.  On my recent trip to Vegas we arrived about 930pm, there were about 7 people in line. After surveying the situation, my very analytical friend stated he estimated the wait to be about 45 mins and wasn't too happy nor were my other 2 friends. I told them it was worth it and convinced them to give it a try. Little did we know the people ahead of us actually had more people in their party and our wait was about an hour.  The lone cook was the same one who made our meal previously but after we ordered he went off duty and Holloman took over. He is so passionate about his food btw. My friend was the only one who didn't order the combo and ordered the Shrimp & Lobster Fra Di Ablo instead. Holloman explained to him what he was going to put in it: basil, tomatoes and then told him he was going to make him a sexy dish. Ok, I was a little jealous.  My other friend who ordered what I ordered, set the spice level at 5 since I ordered it at 4. Telling me he was \"the man\" so I changed my order to a 6 telling him I was \"the man\", lol. Instead of going to a 7, he copied me. Neither of us were adventurous enough to try a 7.   My friend's pasta was very good so good that we decided to half and share our meal but I got so caught up in mine that I ate almost everything before either of us remembered to share. Oh well next time.   I can't say enough about Holloman. He genuinely looked like he has a passion for cooking. His enthusiasm was pleasant to watch. When he would put the shrimp or lobster in our pan roast he looked at it carefully and chucked the ones he didn't like. Despite being very busy he still was personable and engaging with the people on the counter. When he made something other than pan roast he'd go to the person who ordered it and tell them what he was going to put in it. Thought that was a nice touch.  He was making a shrimp scampi according to how a customer wanted it as indicated on the ticket. When he was done he shook his head and said he wasn't happy with it but the waiter told him that's how the customer wanted it. That customer happened to be sitting next to me. She's from Hawaii btw and now lives in Vegas, yea I talk to anyone lol. Anywho, Holloman asked her if he could make some changes and told her what he was going to do. She said sure and when he placed her dish in front of her, I wished she was my friend so I could share. She thoroughly enjoyed it and told him so.   So yes, even if you read reviews on here talking about long waits or that it's not that great, oh well, maybe they had an off day. I can tell you that each and every time I've been there, the food has always been very good and I've never left disappointed. The portions are quite generous so I suggest sharing. I couldn't finish all of mine but did eat all the seafood.   Oh and my friends who complained about the wait and threatened me that it better be worth it, did admit that it was worth it. So there you have it. Don't be put off by wait times. I suggest going when Holloman is there. He works from about 1030pm.",

People are insane to wait over an hour for overcooked pasta and crustacean. I am not impressed at all.    Additionally, they didn't have the courtesy to tell me they were out of their small clams for their linguine and clam dish. They decided to make it with what they had, even though, it isn't the way they make it.   At minimum, they should let people know they are out of an item before they order it. And, in fact, they should have a sign listing what they are out of before someone waits a few hours of their life.   I wouldn't come here again.",

Like the name says, it's a bar so seating is limited, maybe around 20 seats. The service was great here the last time I came.  You get to watch the chef cook with the steam kettles which is cool. We ordered oysters and the pan roast with level 8 spicy. The oysters always taste fresh and the house pan roast is the best from all the other places I've tried it. It's a tomato base soup like dish with shrimp, lobster, and crab with a scoop of rice. I think level 8 spiciness is perfect.   Always a trip to go here but definitely worth it!",

Found out this place is the original and the place i go is a knock off from this place with the old cook from oyster bar as well.  The wait was about 15min and I guess I got very lucky got seated ordered a few appetizers and they were just okay nothing special at all.  Then the great pan roast arrivced with my noodles and rice on the side the way I like it spice level 10 asked for some cheese and... omg literally best thing I've ever had. I don't know how I'm going to go back to my regular spot.   I will always come to this location anytime I visit Vegas. Oyster bar you are truly a masterpiece in taste. This was the highlight of my Vegas trip of course me losing a few hundred does make it help.",

Nestled in Palace Station casino, this place is really a great find, and a hidden gem but blown up through yelp. Seafood here is divine. Must be 21+ to eat here  Pan roast: this was really flavorful and the rice added just the right balance. Beware, the portions are bigger than you think they are. This was so good, but I could only eat about 3/4 before feeling completely stuffed. Also a good tip, we ordered an 8 spicy and boy was this spicy. Eyes were watering. I normally have a good tolerance but I would probably only recommend going with an 6 next time.  Clam chowder: really delicious and flavorful. Perfect balance of creamy and sweet with the clams. Plentiful amount of clams.  Alaskan chowder: literally a bigger bowl of clam chowder with the same base, but more clams. This was good, but I'll probably get a clam chowder next time.    Linguini diavola: while this was also amazing, it was outshined by the other dishes. I would say it's not at flavorful as the other dishes, so probably won't get this next time.  Overall, this was such a great experience. I will be dragging my friends and family members here for more! Regarding wait times, we arrived at around 9am, and got lucky, there was no wait on this Saturday, Christmas Eve. I feel like as long as you get there between 4am-9am, you don't have to wait too long. There are only 18 seats, so best to get there early.  Hope you enjoy! My family sure did",

Sheesh the flavor was all there, 11pm at night standing in line for a crab pan roast. Call me crazy but I did and stood there waiting alone. The service is even good considering the amount of people they probably run into throughout the day with exhaustion from waiting in line for so long. I enjoyed every bit of my pan roast including the oysters fresh and juicy.",

At first, I didn't really want to wait the line or wasn't that interested; so she call me when it was closer to the front of the line. We waited a total of 45mins, which wasn't that bad considering we were talking. The waitress explained to us the the top 3 soups. I ended choosing the combo pan that had shrimp, crab, and lobster with a tomato creamy based soup! I must say it was DELICIOUS and definitely worth the wait. The chef EZE was super nice and friendly, personally tipped him myself. I would definitely make a stop the oyster bar every time I visit Las Vegas.",

    "text": "After reading all of the glowing reviews, we finally made our way to the Oyster Bar and we were not disappointed!  For starters, we ordered a dozen fresh oysters on the half-shell.  Although the oysters were large, they did not have the briny taste that I look for.  I asked the waitress where they procure their oysters and she said Louisiana.  Maybe I'm used to oysters from the East coast.  For entrees, we ordered the Combo Pan Roast and the Lobster Gumbo.  The pan roast was creamy and filled with shrimp, crab and lobster and the Level 5 spiciness was just right.  The lobster gumbo was full of chunks of tender lobster and it was delicious!  And, contrary to popular belief, there IS an optimal time to come to the Oyster Bar.  We came at 9:30 am on a Tuesday and did not have to wait at all.  Then, at 10 am, we were the only two customers there.  I've attached a photo that shows all of the empty seats just waiting for customers!",

Upon arrival at 4am, the bar was jam packed and we were behind another party of 2. The wait was about 10 minutes and once sat, the server Steve gave us a minute to look over the menu and being first timers I was definitely trying to order anything and everything.   We ordered: 1. Combo Pan Roast 2. 2 dozen oysters  3. A seafood jambalaya 4. Alaskan Clam Chowder  Everything here gets cooked in front of you and the chef is a master at his craft! He was SO good at making the dishes and shucking oysters simultaneously - I was super amazed. Our food came out piping hot and although everything was delicious, the Alaskan clam chowder was the winner for me. The crab meat came in chunks and it was probably the best thing that I've ever eaten. Wasn't too salty - just PERFECT! The oysters were super plumpy and I thought ordering 2 dozen for a party of 3 was way too much. It was crazy to see people still waiting in like at 5am to eat at this place but it's SO worth it. Just a heads up though, the plates are huge and are definitely shareable. I felt as though I ate a whole cow and barely made a dent in the seafood jambalaya.   All in all, the Alaskan chowder is a must but be prepared to wait to eat here. I will definitely be back.",

Order the pan roast combo if you are first timer, its the best for trying shrimp, lobster and crab pieces in a curry like sauce with asian white rice.  Clam chowder was great and try the beer (ask of for the take home size glass)  Arrive very early since the wait can easily be for a few hours.  We even were early at 5pm but it still was a hour wait but still well worth it.  Also kids are not allowed so that could be a good or bad thing.",

Yeah... but they weren't the best I've had either.   If you're looking for the bar, it's gonna be in the middle of the casino to the left as you walk in from the Strip.

I shared a shrimp pan roast and it was more than enough for 2 people to finish.  The pan roast was quite tasty and fulfilled my appetite.  The food was quite balanced but the wait to get seated was long.  But if you don't want to wait in line and check this place out, it is open 24 hours a day.

They ask so they can charge you an extra five dollars but the plates were so big it actually saves you money to share rather than order another entree  The clam chowder was amazing and not salty. The oyster fresh and didn't have that fishy aftertaste. The pan roast was amazing and just the right amount of spice Definitely coming back when I am in town!!!",

Open 24 hours is a little bar that seats about 14 people inside of the Palace station Hotel.  I came here at 1AM after the life is beautiful music festival and we waited a good hour before we were seated. I pretty much just sat on the ground and chilled on my phone until our time was up. When we got there, we ordered a dozen oysters (happy hour, $20 for a dozen huge oysters) and the house pan roast with an extra scoop of rice. Unfortunately, it took 30 minutes for the food to be made because there is literally 2 people working. It was cool watching it but at 2AM, I was just starting to fall asleep.  The food was so amazing! The oysters were huge and really fresh. The chef shucks the oysters right in front of you and you can still taste the ocean in each slurp. Yum! Some of the best oysters I've had for the price. As for the pan roast, it was perfect for 2 people. A perfect blend of tomato and spices. It was seafood heaven in a bowl!  Overall, was the one hour and half worth it? Heck yes! This place is freaking amazing and some of the best food in Vegas and that is saying somehting!",

One tip hungry server took 15 seats non stop and long line average 30 people in line day and night. When people get up and dirty seat remain dirty for another 15 mins to seat another guest there. You just cannot handle it, schedule more staff please, labor isn't that expensive for an extra busser at minimum pay. No service whatsoever, you order drink, got your drink, got your bill, sign and that's it. Palace station will always on the bottom of the food chain, because they can't even manage an oyster bar, how can they manage a hotel, and a casino. Note to owner, sell it if someone willing to buy, before you in debt from this property.",

I looked up sea food on yelp, and people seemed to like it, so I decided to give it a try. The wait is longggg after 5pm, but let me tell you- it's worth it. There is a good reason people wait patiently in line for up to hour and a half. I loved the oysters, the clam-chowder, and the pot roast!  Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be back. This might be the reason I come back.  Btw, Sanda and Sergio are great! Thanks guys, I will be back.",

    "text": "I find this place really difficult to review because my food was easily a 4 but my experience was more like a 2. So we'll take the average and go with a 3, and we'll let future visits decide my final rating!  There WILL be a future visit, because the food was really good. I had a combo roast with shrimp, crab and lobster, basically all floating in a delicious, creamy sauce reminiscent of lobster bisque. It was very yummy and filling and EXACTLY what I'd hoped for.  It's a tiny place, with just a few seats around a bar where all of the food is cooked fresh, right in front of you. Let me tell you, it was oh so satisfying when, after an hours' wait, we finally got to take our seats around those bubbling cauldrons of delicious seafoody goodness!  It's slow, but the cook and the servers work really hard to get the food to you as fast as possible, and our waitress was awesomely attentive, considering how busy she was. However... the guy cooking messed up and skipped us twice, serving people who sat down over 20 and 30 minutes later than us. We were there for nearly 3 hours in all and It kinda sucked.  The staff were apologetic when we all figured out what was going on, but the whole thing just felt so disorganized. Waiting in line, when seats open up, they don't really let smaller parties fill in the gaps. There was an end seat on either side of the bar remaining empty almost all night- that bugged the crap out of me, as with a little maneuvering around, another couple could have sat down and let the line move faster, too.  BUT these inconveniences are not a deal-breaker; I'll be back for more delicious shrimp someday soon. And hey, I won $10 at a slot machine while waiting in line, so you can use the time to score a discount on dinner if you are so inclined, haha.",

    "text": "And this was the beginning of the Creole steamer cuisine addiction for me and my love.   After numerous recommendations from Vegas-holics, we decided to try this place. I was very skeptical... \"How could a seafood soup-y thingie be so wonderful? What's with all the hype?\" Little did I know, this one trip would change our culinary lives...  First of all, I wanted to leave after standing a half hour in line in the middle of Palace Station to sit around a counter... After we were sat, and got our sourdough rolls, my tune changed entirely!  We ordered the House Pan Roast, a bowl of Clam Chowder, and some Oyster Shooters. All three were absolutely amazing! The flavor of the seafood soup-y thingie AKA House Pan Roast was unlike any other dish I had tasted before. The clam chowder was thick, full of flavor, and delicious! The oysters were so fresh...   Half of the fun here is watch the servers cook with the steamers and prepare the oyster shooters. They were really friendly and fun, and made the night so enjoyable!  Although we love the Vegas Oyster Bar, we now frequent The Boiler (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiler-chino-hills#hrid:o0b5YAfN8Ndd7t8lNhtz6Q\">yelp.com/biz/the-boiler-...</a>) in our area, which is run by Chef Ritter who started the Vegas location. No more waiting awkwardly in a casino, smelling cigarette smoke - this location is much bigger, with the same amazing of food, if not more (although I do miss those amazing sourdough rolls from the Vegas location... and oyster shooters)!",

The line is super long & it is only 18 seats available.  The two waitress's were joking around and playing.  It took them 20 min to clear 2 seats for my husband and I and everyone else who were seated before us only waited a few min.  We feel as though this was intentional because I over heard a male employee telling her we were complaining about the wait for our table to be cleaned.  After seating she asked if we were ready before giving us a menu & when we answered no I heard Christina say to the male employee well what are they complaining about because they aren't even ready.  I feel it was unprofessional and not appropriate at all.  I will never eat here again because I rather go somewhere my money is appreciated & deserved.",

When you first get to the Oyster Bar, you'll probably have to suffer through an hour long wait, which will be spent trying to see how much food the lucky bastards already seated have left in their bowl and then giving them the stare of death. But trust that your patience will be rewarded!  A must order for me is the Pan Roast with lobster. Its a rich creamy tomato based dish, full of flavor from the chefs secret mix of seasonings and served as spicy as you can handle. One dish should satisfy a grown mans hunger or you can split it with a significant other with a lesser appetite. I would order a clam chowder for good measure.  I'm actually drafting this review while in line to pass the time and avoid giving out too many dirty looks. Do yourself a favor and stop by Palace Station on your next Vegas trip! Keep your party to 4 or less since seating is very limited.",

The counter doesn't serve more than 20 (at most!) at a time--but I assure you--it's worth the wait.    Regardless of what you order--their dishes are cooked to order directly in front of you--and you will have to do everything in your power to not drool all over your setting.  Each dish is loaded with tons of seafood.  Combine with with the butter, spices, and base they let cook in front of you--and your poor stomach will sit in gluttonous anticipation for the next 20 minutes.    I've been here twice--each time ordering the Etouffee. It's amazing!  It's a wonderful creole/french soup that's wonderfully spiced and loaded with seafood.  It's the less creamy version of the Oyster Bar's Pan Roast.  I happen to enjoy the soup more because it's less rich than the Pan Roast--but I've had the Pan Roast--and it's certainly nothing to scoff at.  It's amazing!  Just a tad too rich for me.  You can spice up your dishes the way you like.  I like my spice and generally order a 7.  Spicy, but still enjoyable.  I've tasted an 8...and while delicious...definitely left me gulping down a lot more water than I wanted.    I've seen orders of the shrimp scampi and the linguine a la vongole--and i can tell you that even in my bloated state, wanted to order them. They look crazy good.    Oh--and before I forget...these bowls are huge!  Please share.  If you can finish it on your own--you're a champ.",

I take every visitor from out of town here and this is a spot where we go to drink and eat their rocker fellers which they don't have anymore. The chefs and waitresses are always funny even when they are super slammed. It's entertaining and walking through the casino - even the dealers smile and say hi. I just love this place, always great energy and  always win when I gamble there haha. Enjoy all the good eats!",

    "text": "OMG Ricardo is the man!!!!!!!!!!!  After Sergio left, and numerous failed return visits hoping for a new chef, Ricardo is truly a breath of fresh air.  Yes, their food is legendary, but who's cooking has a lot to do with how much you'll enjoy your experience -- not to mention how long you'll be waiting in that line!  Ricardo is simply amazing.  He can clear out a line 20 people deep in an hour.  And once you've seated and ordered, you won't wait longer than 15 minutes.  Not like you'll be rushing to get out of there when he's cooking.  He is a joy to be around.  Hilarious, entertaining, efficient, and great at what he does.  It's also a pleasure to see someone who is enthusiastic, truly enjoys their job and cares that you have an equally enjoyable experience.  The other cooks (Bob and others not worth remembering) are terrible.  The same line of 20 people, expect to wait about 2-3 hours if you're lucky.  The food sucks, inconsistent (see my prior reviews), and watching them work is like pulling teeth.  Actually, I think pulling teeth would be better.",

    "text": "My group decided to go to Vegas a day early so we chose to stay at Palace Station because my sister wanted to introduce us to the Oyster Bar.  We arrived in Vegas around 3am and were starving by then because we skipped dinner so we would be able to eat.  We were able to snag up 4 seats right away.  At 3am, there were still people eating!  Because of the limited seating (about 15 seats) I hear the wait can be 30 min to an hour long during lunch time and peak hours.  I'm glad they are open 24 hours and we were able to avoid the crowd.  Food: Clam Chowder - Full of fresh seafood, great comfort food House Pan Roast - Amazing flavors I have never tried before.  Must have  Tip:  Portions are huge.  Share the meal but don't ask them to split it for you (there's an extra charge for splitting fee)",

There was a long line to wait to sit down so I figured it was definitely worth the wait. Luckily, I was with other people so I played Roulette while we waited to be seated. Once seated, they take your orders very calmly. They do not rush you considering there is a line of people waiting to eat. The food is cooked in steam pots instead of a gas burner.    I ordered the oyster bloody mary shooters and the Pan roast at level 7 hot..  This place is soo good I would recommend it to anyone...",

    "text": "Oyster Bar.  Wow, this one is a hard one to rate.  Let me tell you why.   Food here is pretty damn good, I must say.  I had their Combo Gumbo, and what's there not to like?  Fresh ingredients, savory, and it's cooked to order right in front of you (BTW, ours was prepared by JJ--awesome Chef).  I'd pass on the Jambalaya.  Way too tomato-based for my liking.  If you're not looking for something very acidic this is definitely not for you.  The oysters were decent.   Here's where it gets tricky:   You're going to end up waiting for a long time.  And it's not a typical wait.  No, it's the annoying, \"I get to see everyone eat, and there are open seats in between them, and why the F*CK can't I sit there???\" kind of wait.  Fine, you're patient, you say?  Well I hope you like the waitress, Delores.  Nice girl and all, but I cannot stand her dry, dry humor.  Seriously, people wait an average of over an hour, the last thing you want to do is joke and say you won't give them their food, \"sorry, we sold out,\" or saying, \"oh, he wants the check, I'm just going to ignore them\".  (Yes, she seriously says that stuff out loud and ignores you).  Stand-Up Comedian, you are not, Delores.  And some of your audience with hungry stomachs do not appreciate it.   I absolutely loves the Chefs and their food, but Delores' service alone makes me not want to come back.",

    "text": "I've eaten here many a times on my visits to Vegas. They're known for their Pan Roast, but personally, I prefer their Alaskan Chowder.  That's their best dish.  The chef is very generous with the seafood and the serving is big enough that there will be leftovers for tomorrow, unless you're a big eater like me, of course.  I also like their 3 for $10 bloody Mary oyster shooters.    The place consists of about a dozen seats and they don't take reservations or names, so you'll have to wait in line, yes, a line like the kind we have to stand in at the awful DMV. But it's worth the wait.  Now, if you want to avoid long lines, I recommend going during their off hours which is around 11 am during the weekends.  I usually go during that time and there hasn't been much of a line.    To sum up, be sure to stop by The Palace Station and make your way to the Oyster Bar for some deeelicious chowder!  Buen provecho!",

    "text": "My first impression was, \"Last meal before departing Vegas. We need something hearty that'll hit the spot.\"  There are several Oyster Bars located in various hotels throughout Las Vegas, but the boyfriend and I decided to try our luck at the Harrah's location after playing on his lucky machine for the weekend. We sat down as a friendly chef approached us with the menu and brought us some flat breads. I couldn't stop munching on the sesame ones.  We ordered the Bourbon Street Jambalaya with Shrimp. It was enough to split and very hearty. If you want one last filling meal before you leave Vegas, you need to try the jambalaya. The shrimp was seasoned well and the entire dish was the definition of rich and flavorful. The sauce was zesty and had andouille and tasso ham which made it even more flavorful.  We met a nice old lady who sat next to us and she offered to share her fried oysters. They were crispy and juicy and I'd definitely get that when I go back. It seemed like she was a regular there, but when we were about to pay for our bill the chef told us that she took the tab. So sweet of her, and it made our trip that much more memorable. The best way to end my 21st birthday memorable!  The lasting impression? \"One of the most delicious ways to serve up seafood...spiced and fried!\"",

When we finally got seated, the oysters were ABOVE AND BEYOND DELICIOUS as well as the rest of our food. The bowl was too big to finish so we had to bring it back to the hotel. Our server, Christopher and our cook, Robert were AWESOME!!!! They also made us laugh while we ate, which was great entertainment. Thanks guys!!! We will be back again.",
