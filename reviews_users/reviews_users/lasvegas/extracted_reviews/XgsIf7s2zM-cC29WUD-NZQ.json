Clean, well prepared sushi..  actually, I enjoyed a lot before.  So, We came back here again, I immideletly noticed quality of food wend down SO MUCH. Now, it's same level as \"Todai\". Mexican style sushi place. Not a real sushi place. So bad.... if u like \"Todai \" then you will enjoy this place...But this will be my last time eating hee. Yucky.......",

    "text": "We usually go to the one by the outlets after a day of shopping, but found out that they've closed that one down! Thankfully Yelp pointed us to this location.  The wait for lunch was not too bad (~20 minute wait) given the amount of people there. Unfortunately there is no waiting room inside of the location, so we were standing out in the cold for a bit. They provide a small heater near the door, but it wasn't enough to keep the crowd of people warm. We didn't mind though- we were more hungry than cold.   There's a nice variety of food to choose from with a bunch of different sushi to try! I'm not very fond of different types of sushi, so some labels would've been nice for sushi noobs like myself. But every one that I tried was delicious, so I didn't mind. I usually don't get noodles or fried rice at buffets, but they have a different, distinct taste when compared to your average Asian restaurant, and is definitely worth trying! The udon is quite tasty as well. The tempura goes quick, so definitely get it while it's fresh! The dessert selection is great and you can even get some ice cream on a cone to go!  Overall, it's a great place to eat and it's well worth the wait. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in town!",

    "text": "Maybe I'm just spoiled by all the AYCE sushi places now? This used to be THE place to go, and now I remember why I go there MAYBE once a year, lol.  I decided to go here for lunch on Saturday ($18.95). I was a little more in the mood for some regular Japanese food than sushi, but once we sat down to eat we realized we should've just gone to Umiya instead.   Nothing really stands out anymore which makes me sad :[ On the hot side I had the fried noodles, beef sukiyaki, calamari, gyoza, green mussels and shrimp/vegetable tempura. All were ALRIGHT. A couple years back the sukiyaki would melt in your mouth, but now it was just okay. If I were to say something stood out, it would definitely be the calamari. If it was there the first round I went, I would've gotten half a plate's worth! What can I say? I love squid.  They have a decent variety for lunch, including ramen, an udon station and of course the whole sushi side. One half of it is rolls and the other is nigiri. The cuts of fish were nice and large on the nigiri, but the amount of rice matched it. So much that you couldn't really taste the fish... at all. Why would you eat sushi that you couldn't really taste?  Speaking of barely tasting something, I would save my money and just order water instead of iced green tea. At first I was convincing myself that the flavor wasn't that strong because of the food I was eating, but when my boyfriend tried it he pretty much said I paid $1.75 for green water, lol.  I know it's a buffet, but it's the same price as the AYCE sushi bars for lunch, so really, if you're craving sushi opt for Sakana (for nigiri), Goyemon (for rolls) or Umiya (for a ton of appetizers). There's nothing wrong with the service here. I would say they could space the tables out a little more so it felt less like \"community seating\". Luckily when we got there it was towards the late end of the lunch service so it was starting to empty out, but I've had experiences in the past where I was practically bumping elbows with strangers while eating.   Honestly, I think I'm done with Makino for now, at least until I decide to give it my annual pilgrimage for old time's sake, haha.",

However, what they lacked for in selection, they made up for in terms of service. Generally with buffet style establishments, you never see your server other then for a bill or the original drink order. The staff here though are on top of it all. Drinks were promptly refilled and plates cleared after every time we got up.   While I usually stay away from sushi at these kinds of places, I do trust it during lunch time when it's really busy and they turn it over quite a bit and when they first open as its fresh. Many of the usual standby were still present but I did miss the tempura selection the other location used to offer. Overall though, still a solid place.",

If you are allergic to lobster and crab like me, don't worry because you will still have many mouth-watering choices.

I could probably pick food with my eyes closed and still be happy. All the other food (desserts, crab, clams, muscles...) were good too. The place was busy but the staff was quick and attentive. The price for dinner is a little too expensive for me but I will definitely be back for lunch.   To Andrew J who made the comment about the chefs I did notice that the sushi chefs were Hispanic and speaking Spanish but It wasn't loud or distracting. I feel it isn't fair to the restaurant that you gave them a lower rating for that reason. While I was there one customer asked one of the chefs for a specific roll and he was nothing but friendly and quick to complete her request. I think its a little racist to demand Asian sushi chefs to consider the food good. I also doubt you would have noticed or cared if the chefs were Vietnamese or from some asian country other than Japan. Cooking good food depends on skill and quality of ingredients not ethnicity. Anyone can cook any style of food regardless of ethnic background.",

Will totally come again whenever I'm in town.  You know, come to think of it, most Vegas buffet is totally outrageously priced now.  You can EASILY spend $40-$50 per person at other places.  Compared to that, Makino is still only about half the price, and way better quality when it comes to the Japanese/sushi/seafood category.  Especially with kids in tow, that could add up to pretty good savings.",

    "text": "I'm surprised to see the mixed reviews for this place. And I'm surprised people thought Todai was better than Makino's.. I don't know, maybe Todai in the Bay Area is just really shitty, cause Todai isn't good at all around here. Anyhow, my friends and I wanted to go to Makino since we knew it was a sushi/Japanese buffet. Also, my boyfriend and I had tried Makino's in Honolulu and it wasn't that great, but his parents mentioned that the one in Vegas was a lot better.  First of all, I thought the quality of food was actually very good considering it is a buffet. Also, the restaurant was very clean while we were here and the service was also very attentive and friendly. We never had to ask for refills or for our plates to be taken away.   Makino offers sushi, hot food (fried rice, grilled meats, tempura, fish, soup), a salad bar with like eight different types of salads, and then a dessert area. A lot of people seem to think the sushi quality isn't that great. Yeah, it's not GREAT sushi, but I think for a buffet, the quality is pretty high. And even though the rolls are kind of repetitive , they're all really big.  The salad bar has some really good salads - my favorite was the cucumber seaweed salad.  Then on to the hot food, tempura was good and they also had White Ba-Sa fish which was very tasty.  Last but not least, the dessert area has yummy desserts. they have fresh fruit, a chocolate fountain , crepes, ice cream, and different types of mini cakes/pastries.  OH, and they have AMAZING green tea ice cream. On top of that, my favorite was the creme brulee.  Bottom line.. I think people are reviewing this place kind of harshly. Come on, it is a buffet and you're only paying around $25.00. If the food here was at a restaurant and you paid a la carte for each item, then I would have given them a lower rating. But being a buffet, I think the food here is very good.",

    "text": "ahhh makino. a seafood buffet off the strip that serves sushi, crab, mini stuffed lobsters (giant shrimp), fondue, and chinese style buffet food. Sounds great considering whats on the menu, but none of the items seemed to tickle my taste buds. they were all decent, but nothing great.   the service was nice. filled our drinks without us asking. there was a sign on the sushi window saying they charged 25 cents for all the uneaten rice from the sushi. but i dont think they really charge that. just to discourage people from eating sashimi without being full on rice.   quality of the fish seemed a little old. felt like it was at room temperature which isnt a good thing. but none of us got sick.   so i give this place a 3 star rating. they can work on more variety in desserts. more variety with the rolls. serve a little better quality fish in the sushi section.",

Two contained raw fish that was dried out as well as dried rice and smelt eggs are not suppose to be flat and darkly colored and dry wilted leaves for the rolls that support them, and avocado of brown to blackish color.   This place gets one star for trying to poison it's customers and rob them of 20 dollars per person.   Some things you can make in the morning and leave out until dinner and no one will be the wiser. YOU DO NOT DO IT WITH RAW FISH  EPIC FAIL  until i get a chance and 20 dollars to throw away for a redo",

    "text": "I'm a huge sushi-buffet enthusiast because I'm cheap and I love mass quantities of food, so I was super-excited to head to Makino's $17 lunch buffet. But I was pretty disappointed by the whole experience.   First, because we'd tried to go to their dinner buffet at 9 pm the previous night, but were turned away because they were taking away the food. But I managed to get a glimpse of a gleaming heap of oysters and crab legs that was decidedly lacking at the lunch buffet.   Second, because all the rolls were tasteless and bland and seemed to be variations of the same thing. I hate deceit!   Third, because of their small selection of fresh sashimi -- I love mackerel, but I was sad to see a few paltry pieces in the corner.  The best thing about Makino was the dessert bar's chocolate fountain. Holy shit I had no idea how fabulous a thing a chocolate fountain could be. Bowls of fruit and marshmallows with long sticks and a yum yum yummy chocolate coating. But it kind of pissed me off when they turned it off at 2:30, a half hour before their stated closing time.  All in all, so-so.",

I'm not sure how to compare it to other sushi buffet restaurants since if you've been going to other ones like Todai for a while now like me and have gotten tired of the same old stuff then this place is a great place to try something different.

    "text": "I went here with my youngest daughter and a couple of other families from the basketball team our girls play on. My wife (who wasn't there because she was with my other daughter's team this evening), had raved about how great Makinos was, so I was looking forward to it.  I was impressed with the large variety of sushi, especially the maki sushi (cut rolls). I have never seen such a wide selection, and I understand the chefs will make you a handroll if you ask. However, I'm more of a fan of the basic nigiri sushi, so I piled my plate with pieces of yellowtail & salmon roe. With the exception of some of the weirder looking rolls, the quality seemed pretty decent, and maybe that was because it was a busy night (Saturday night with a lot of big groups in the house) so there was a lot of turnover on the food.  There's plenty of shellfish, from raw oysters to steamed clams to mussels. Lots of king crab legs, too (tip: if you don't want spray the people around you when you break the shells by hand, ask the waitress for some crab crackers and she'll bring a few to your table).  With so many raw foods to choose from, I skipped the hot ones (except for the steamed clams & mussels, which weren't all that great). Lots of desserts, but I was disappointed not to get any ice cream; the station wasn't manned for a long time and I finally gave up.  At $26 for dinner, price is a bit high, but it's sushi, shellfish & crab legs so it's understandable. One thing I really like, that all other buffets should emulate (listen up, Soup Plantation), is that they charge kids by height instead of age: dinner for rugrats under 4 feet is $6.99 and under 5 feet is $12.99 (and I think under age 3 or 4 is free). Quality might not be all that, but what do you expect for a buffet? I could easily spend the same amount at a regular sushi bar and not get my fill.",

I've sang the praises of this restaurant to everyone if Sushi comes up and it's been superb until now.  Now it's just okay and far from where it was.  Changed to some type of rice that was dry and had a cheap taste to it, dishes for wasabi have changed to disposable plastic.  Tuna is too red and appears to have color added.  Since when do you put pieces of carrot in sushi rolls unless you're looking for a cheap filler?  Too many rolls have cream cheese.  I like cream chees but should have a slight presence in sushi rolls.  The final straw of 'cheapness' is that they don't even have toothpicks anymore.  Okay when they stopped offering mints but toothpicks are important have little cost effect.  Looks like an end to an era.",

    "text": "For some reason or another, a trip to Makino everytime I'm in Vegas to see the folks has unknowingly become a Chang family tradition. Sure that didn't occur without some major arm twisting, since the place is not cheap, but somehow every holiday break, we find ourselves cruising along Decatur, ready for some fish.  About the food, to be completely frank I never know how to judge buffets. Let's see... Price? As stated, the place isn't cheap but lunch is pretty affordable ($15) with pretty much the same selection as dinner ($25) except with crab legs and some more seafood stuffs.  Food? If Japanese food means chicken teriyaki and sushi, then you have Japanese food coming out the woodworks. They have different combinations of sushi, from spicy tuna inside, unagi outside, unagi inside, spicy tuna outside, california roll with spicy tuna outside, etc. you get the point: limited fillings but done in different combinations for your pleasure. Selection is pretty vast so whether you're hankering for greens, fish, desserts, noodles, poultry, red meat, soup, or otherwise, you'll probably find it here, done with an East Asian flair.   Freshness? Dinner seems more and more a rip since some items seem to be left over from lunch, but their King Crab Legs are super fresh and my mom always makes sure we get our $25 a head's worth in lump crab meat. For the record, I hate dissecting crab legs, I never had the talent for such a task. But the legs here are surprisingly easy to break apart, if that's any consolation. The sushi is usually pretty fresh, but like I said, sometimes you can tell the stuff was left over from lunch and the sashimi gets a bit dried out. Not a big deal, I haven't gotten sick off this place (yet).   Service? The wait staff seats you and takes your empty plates away. They fill drinks and don't talk to you. Nothing spectacular. Trying to get ice cream from the staff behind the dessert counter seems a bit more arduous, but come on, it's ice cream, you can work for it. Prices are the same on holidays and weekends as weekdays (lunch $15, dinner $25) so don't hesitate to stop by on a weekend when the turnover is higher.   Overall, I find it a better value than buffets a mile down on the strip, so if you're hankering for uncontrolled access to calories, try driving those couple extra blocks away from Las Vegas Blvd.",

There was also a good variety of other hot items like noodles, rice, teriyaki, crab, fresh made noodle soups, etc. In addition, there's a chocolate fountain with fruits you can dip in it and ice cream which they'll scoop for you (including green tea).  Definitely beats Todai which I think has been going downhill the last 2 times I have been there. A friend told me about this place - definitely more of a place where the locals go and you won't see many tourists around (BIG plus). It's off the main Vegas strip so you will need to take a cab and call for one later.  Dinner buffet is $22. I'll definitely be back.  Bottom line: if you are looking for pretty tasty sushi in an all-u-can-eat setting without many tourists, I think this is a great place. If you are looking for Vegas' best sushi, go to one of the many high-end sushi places that you'll find in the nicer casinos.",

The variety isn't Golden Corral, but its unique in that it's a sushi buffet, as opposed to an All You Can Eat Sushi Restaurant. There are a number of different rolls and some sashimi (shrimp, eel, salmon, tuna). But the rolls aren't particularly appetizing, it's more like a one and done. I didn't feel like eating a roll twice. I didn't see any baked rolls either. For this price, I can't really complain. Tip: If you wanna eat just the tuna or salmon, get the poke. It's more flavorful.   The other food is surprisingly appetizing. The snow crab legs and pork ribs are good. They have green tea and strawberry ice cream. I'd recommend avoiding the green tea and snow cones, since they give you an entire bowl of ice for the snow cone.   It sounds like I'm hating on this place a lot, but $20 for infinite crab legs is worth it by itself. The sushi and desserts are just icing on the cake.",

Their sushi is good and for a buffet that's hard to come by. We came here for lunch, but wouldn't mind coming back for dinner since we love seafood. I liked their noodle bar where you pour what kind of soup u want in the bowl. I love udon soup and I'm glad they have this. I wouldn't mind if they get pho too. Overall the buffet is awesome.",

    "text": "Ah, Makinos. 12 years ago when their location at the north outlets still existed...it was our fave place to \"splurge\" on. All you can eat sushi including hot food, salads, soups, desserts, etc...the sushi always seemed to be the best value you'd get for the price.  We have been to the Decatur location a few times now and each time it has been such a party to get into. I find this place a little too fitted. Not as spacious and when it is busy, it's like a circuit to walk through. I started to feel the decline in their sushi, especially, at the outlet location before they closed...but after frequenting this location...I really really am feeling it. You can see the age in the sushi as it sits, rice has been a bit old, and I can't stand the cross contamination. You know when one tong has been used for different sushis. Which may not be a big deal...but when someone is using one tong for one sushi then the same one for another...people with allergies could suffer from this easily from those who aren't conscious to such things.   While I do know that the price you pay for the options you get isn't so bad...because I've seen this place years ago, and with all the ayces out there...this place wouldn't be it for us/me. I'd rather pay about the same price for a place that specializes specifically on sushi rather than one that tries to carer to everyone's preference...because quite frankly, there are those who want sushi and then another person in their party doesnt. I feel like this place works best for such situation.   On that note, despite what I feel...I'd recommend them if whatever I typed makes sense to you. They had a working high chair when I was there but please leave the stroller in the trunk because it gets crazy busy in there and space gets limited.  Enjoy!",

Our local friends treated us for a dinner which is why we came here. I was impressed how busy this place was, indicating there were many good eats to try.  I'm not really a buffet person because I get easily overwhelmed with so many selections. At this place, the food counter stretched from one end of the restaurant to the other!   With over a hundred food choices, I particularly enjoyed the crab legs and seafood entree, Japanese fried rice and teriyaki selections. I appreciated the attentiveness of the waiters by removing our used plates from our table in a timely fashion.  For $25 per person, I will definitely visit this place whenever I'm in Vegas.",

Went here during Thanksgiving and even though my party of 3 got there at 5pm (when the restaurant opened at 5), we had to wait an hour because the restaurant first opened its doors for reservations, aka parties of 6 or more.  Maybe it was because we had to wait in the cold for an hour but food was pretty standard of an Asian buffet with some redeemable qualities.    Ramen was kind of tasty. Miso soup dispenser.  I know its weird to get miso soup from a dispenser but I am a miso soup fiend and I hate asking my server the sixth time for another helping of miso soup.  So at least I can continue to keep getting more so I won't feel as bad when I get my 15th bowl of soup.  For that reason alone, I bumped up this review to a 4.",

Everything tastes very fresh, no complaints at all about the food. They have one section for sushi, one section for cooked foods (like ramen, fried rice, tempura, etc.) and then one section for dessert. Servers came by to refill our drinks very frequently, I was surprised at how on top of their game they were despite how busy it is!

Lunch time yielded a half hour wait.  The sushi, nigiri, and everything else tasted fresh.    For dinner we thought we'd arrive early to beat the crowd only to find roughly 10 parties already lined up at the side entrance waiting in the windy cold weather at 4:50pm.  To our surprise and delight they opened the doors at 5pm (normal dinner hour starts at 5:30pm) to accommodate everyone.  It's smart on their part because they can squeeze in more customers during dinner service.  Once we got in we enjoyed the salmon and tuna sashimi, as well as crab legs.     We always had our plates promptly removed and drinks refilled before we asked for them hence the 5 stars.  They were barraged with kids running around spilling things and the staff were on top of things.  We will definitely return.",

Hahah-- no. Whatever, so I ask her how much it was about 2 times, because she acted like she didn't hear me. And when she finally \"heard\" me, she says; \"Oh, for mother's day abou $30 something. Which might be too expensive for you two.\" EXCUSE YOU.  LIVID, I turn over to a different person and asked what time their last call was. Ohhhp, girl.. Their last call is at 9:15. And they take away the food, of course, at 9:30. WHEN THEY CLOSE. And that last girl tried to save herself. \"Oh I didnt realize the time, you guys will still have time.\"   No. Good bye.

    "text": "Huge selection of different makizushi rolls. Typical selection of nigirizushi, but the quality was that which you would expect of sushi purchased from within a large chain grocery store (it is a buffet, afterall).  The crab legs were my favorite item since I don't get an opportunity to feast on them often. My guess is the crab legs are prepared by boiling them.  The boil is aggresively brined and I would have eaten more crab legs but they were way too salty. I liken it to the movie theater that oversalts their popcorn so you eat less and drink more. Despite the imbalance, I would return tomorrow to have them again if I had time.   Overall, I agree with the majority of yelpers and the 4 star rating. There is something for everyone here.  I would return and I recommend this restaurant to others.",

Monday-Thursday lunch $16.95 Monday-Thursday dinner $25.95 Fri, Sat, Sun, and holidays lunch $17.95 Fri, Sat, Sun, and holidays dinner $26.95 Drinks not included  They did not allow photos of the sushi on the buffet which seemed odd.  Forks, spoons, and napkins were near the plates.  Chopsticks were already on the tables.  There were large bowls of wasabi and ginger near the sushi.  There were 2 bowls of soy sauce, but they were watery.  There were little dishes for the wasabi and ginger.  I liked the chicken wings, shrimp tempura and the Manila clams.  The sushi was okay.  They had a small chocolate fountain with fresh fruit and marshmallows. They also had ice cream.   I liked the green tea cake.  I didn't care for the flan.  I would come back for weekday lunch.",

But, Makino was good with utilizing their space.    Food wise there was a good variety packed in a small space.  They had a whole table of various cooked fresh sushi and sashimi. Their fried rice was fantastic.  Dessert section was small but interesting and they offered ice cream and SHAVED ICE - which we don't have in Houston. Limited fruits but they were sweet. The soups were hearty!  Their seafood soup was full of SNOW CRAB LEGS!   From a foodie/restauranteur perspective, it's nice to hear Japanese managers/owners giving feedback to the Japanese sushi chefs.  Yes, I was being very nosy but I LIKED hearing seeing and hearing the manager/owner run her show in a positive manner and her staff took it all to heart.  PLUS, the food was great.  I wish I could bring them to Houston.",

We arrived an hour and a half before closing, the wait wasn't long at all. We were seated right away.  Customer service was good. All the employees were really friendly and nice. The one server who said a medium size sake was a good size for my bf & I was wrong... (since we like to drink while eating). I wanted a large but she recommended a medium... anyways, on to the food....  Sushi - 2/5  I'm a fan of nigiri. They had a wide range of nigiris, rolls & even hand rolls made to order! But this is a review on the nigiri only... quality was ok. Not the freshest or best sushi I ever had, but it is a buffet. Can't expect too much... haven't tried the other sushi items so can't say much about it.  Hot food items - 4.5/5 They had lots of hot food items. From made to order ramen, to tempura, roast beef & more. The selection was big! I liked pretty much everything. The food didn't taste bland at all. The winner was of course the snow crab legs!!!   Dessert - 5/5 They also have a wide range of different cakes, also ice cream & a chocolate fountain! Way to go makino!!  I recommend this place if you have a big appetite but don't know what you're craving for and want a bit of everything. I would stay away from the sushi.... but go for everything else instead! Might be coming back to stuff my face with more crab legs!! YUMMM",

    "text": "The fact that this place is only rated 3 and a half stars baffles me. It's so so soo hard for me to find a really good sushi place where I enjoyed everything I had. This is the first sushi buffet I've been to. They have everything here. If you're craving sushi, crab legs, ramen, and just a very wide and delicious variety of seafood, come here! Their chowder is really good here, I had 3 bowls of it! Their crab legs are really good here,  probably one of my favorite items here. What I love about it is you just go get your own plate. You don't have to order a whole 6 or 8 piece roll like your typical sushi restaurant. I love that because I can only have a few of each and have enough room to sample a little of everything they have! For my husband and I, we paid $77 before tip. It's a little pricier, but you will get your money's worth here. Can't wait to come back!",

You can order handrolls 2 at a time. I did see a lot of people getting nigiri but I have trust issues so I didn't venture into that. I had a flight to catch in a few hours and didn't want to risk it.  Their beef sukiyaki soup was great. I did enjoy the shrimp tempura and steak teriyaki. Love that they had mini seafood pancakes! I wish they had spider handrolls that would have been awesome but hey can't have it all. They had green tea ice cream which I got on my way out.",

    "text": "Quick tips:  1. Located in a very busy strip mall on Decatur and Flamingo! You might have to park a bit far from this one.  2. You can request hand rolls made to order from the sushi chefs!  3. You can request your ramen spicy!  As promised, this is part of my post-Vegas binge series of reviews. It's a shame that I haven't ever reviewed this place considering that it has been an old favorite of my family for quite a few years now. Since the first time that I was wowed by this place, not a lot has really changed except for my own personal tastes.  The service here is fast, friendly, and efficient. Normally, my family comes very early so there is little to no wait time between getting in and being seated. However, I have noticed that if you are more towards the prime time of dining, you should expect to wait quite awhile to get in.  As for the rest of the staff, I haven't really had many problems either with the waiters and waitresses or the sushi chefs and other cooks. Most requests are met with certainty and the waitress comes often enough that the tables are pretty clean and never really full of dishes.  The food is divided into hot food and sushi. We were just in for dinner last month, so this is a review for the dinner sushi. For dinner, they offer nigiri as well as cuts of sashimi. We noticed that there is quite a bit of rice stuffed under the fish, but at least the raw cuts were nice and fresh. By far a favorite of mine is the salmon skin nigiri and accompanying rolls.   As you make your way around the sushi area, you'll notice that they have many various types of rolls. I tried most of them except for the deep fried ones because they seemed to be a heart attack waiting to happen. Anyways, the rolls are what are considered common: rice, vegetables, and questionable types of fish covered in some thick sauce. Overall the rolls were fine, though filled a bit with too much rice.  One of the things I always enjoy are their handrolls. They premake the handrolls and leave them out for you to grab on your own; however, if you have a special request for a different type of fish, you can always ask them to make you a custom hand roll.  For the hot food, there are the various normal types of things you would see at a Japanese buffet such as chicken teriyaki, fried rice, calamari, salt-pepper shrimp and the like. They also put out shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, and a delightful ramen station that is made to order. I suggest trying the spicy tonkatsu ramen! They also serve udon around the corner as well as Korean-style galbi short ribs.  For dessert, there is a pretty big selection of cakes, ice cream, frozen yogurt, as well as a chocolate fountain. When we went, however, the chocolate fountain looked like it wasn't as smooth as other places. In fact, after making a chocolate fountain at home, I've sworn off of using them. This is because of the massive amount of oil that goes into making the chocolate run smoothly. I wasn't really impressed with their desserts because the cakes, pastries, and cookies were all run of the mill offerings that you would expect at any Chinese/Japanese buffet.  Overall, this is still one of our favorite spots to stop at because the food is affordable and not insanely priced like most of the rest of the strip. I hope you have a chance to check out Makinos soon!",

I have had better sushi and sashimi in little hole in the wall sushi places in the Midwest. Price is not worth it at all.

Located about 10 minutes from the strip in a mediocre area of Vegas. I don't know the price per head because I didn't pay, Woot!   This isn't just any kind of buffet but a Japanese Buffet. It was just average and the sashimi didn't taste fresh at all and I'm glad I didn't try to beef because several people in our party got food poisoning! they did have a great selection of sushi rolls and most of them had a lil too much rice and less fish. I would come back to give it another try.",

Only a short distance from The Las Vegas Strip, it's off Flamingo Rd.  Food 4 Less is the main player in the strip mall it holds court in.  Not much night lights  to help with the visuals, so just cruise to the north end and you'll find it.  The joint is PACKED with Asian folk of ALL ages, so MUST be bringin' it right to keep the masses happy.  Our attendants were pretty good at keeping the drinks full and limiting the plate piles.  So with unlimited access, we sampled a few things...  I'm definitely in agreement with the yelpers that say Makino food quality is a MAJOR step up from Todai, IF you have to compare it to something.  I've had many an Asian buffet in my journey, and this is the best BUFFET sushi quality so far, with an impressive selection.  The chicken, beef, and pork options were all tasty and tender.  The fresh seafood options (oysters, crab legs, fish & shrimp) were always well stocked.  The tempura options were all crunchy yummy.  You're offered a  dessert zone that is Asian influenced and all delicious.  You can also do the chocolate fountain thang and get your hearts content of 6 ice cream options.  YUMMY!!!  Oh man, we all left STUFFED!  I was one HAPPY Chubba Bubba fur sure :) Prices are VERY reasonable, especially for the quality of food that is prepared here.  This is easily something we would come back to, and could recommend to anyone looking for a Japanese buffet in Las Vegas.  Just so you know, they take reservations for parties of 8 or more.  Enjoy!",

It is so busy, people are being herded in and out like cattle, making it very stuffy. Expect a wait, always. We waited an hour.  I will say you definitely get the bang for your buck. It is extremely reasonable for a buffet/AYCE style sushi, but there's something about eating mass produced sushi in a warm environment that makes me kind of nauseas. If you're on the same page as me, they have cooked food as well. I couldn't get past eating raw food in this environment so I opted for that.  They have beer and wine available which is a plus! (Not part of buffet pricing). There is also a guy that makes hand rolls of your choice and it is delicious. The hand roll guy and chocolate fountain were my favorite parts of this interesting dining experience.",

    "text": "It is a decent Asian type food buffet plus a pretty good sushi variety.  It gets 2 stars because the value for the price is not great.  The service was exceptional, but still not worth upgrading the stars due to the price.  Las Vegas has many AYCE sushi places.  Not many are a buffet.  Most are around $25.  Las Vegas also has many AYCE buffets specializing in Asian food.  Not many are $25, but they don't offer the variety of sushi Makino does.  Not far from here are better options for both at a much better value.    I have been on a quest to try Makino for a couple of months after hearing about it and checking out the website.  A sushi buffet sounded interesting and I had read good things.  Since I was on the west side of town near Makino, I finally had my chance today.  It was crowded so I took that as a good sign.    After paying like $30 for lunch, I expected a lot, being I've been to several of the AYCE sushi places, at least 9 in the 4 months I've lived in Las Vegas.    The desert section looked great, and then there was some standard Japanese fare, like tempura shrimp, and some chicken dishes with fried rice and noodles.  Then there was the sushi area.  It wasn't nearly as majestic as the videos on the website make it seem.  There were many varieties of sushi and fresh fish, but most were just bland instead of the flavorful varieties I've experienced at the other AYCE places.  Most didn't have any additional sauces with them to compliment the flavor. The desert section was pretty good.    As I mentioned above, service was excellent, but I will not be back.  Life's too short for bland sushi for the price that's more than many better sushi places.",

    "text": "You would know that an asian restaurant is great if mostly all of the customers are asian! =]  Makino's is the place my family from out of town goes to celebrate birthdays since it is a bit more special than the average buffet. They have a massive sushi selection including sashimi (which is unlikely for buffets to have) and a cook creating hand rolls of your choice. Next, they have a variety of salads and then seafood, including crab legs and baked shrimp. Down the line they also have steak, bbq ribs and a few more selections. One of my favorites at this restaurant is the soup. They have a friendly cook making your choice of soup and mine, the shoyu, was ready in a few minutes. There is also shomai and potstickers which were both delicious as well.  For dessert, there is a whole lot of choices such as green tea ice cream, creme brulee, coffee jello, cookies, marshmallows, puff pastries and a chocolate fondue fountain.  Overall, I give this place four stars. Great food. Great service. Plus theres a huge purple octopus hanging from the ceiling of the restaurant that my boyfriend finds quite amusing =]]",

Makino is good, not best but good.   I went for lunch and there was no sashimi, which I'm not sure whether they offer it for dinner or not offer at all. I'm not a big fan of rice, so nigiri won't do me any good. Makino has tons of rolls, I mean tons. They offer so many kinds of rolls, occupy the whole section on the right hand side. Their rolls are good but the rice portion is too much for me.  Hot food and cooked food is average. They don't offer so many hot dishes and as of I'm writing this review a week after I left Vegas, I had no impression or memory about their cooked dishes.   So overall, Makino has good price and good variety of sushi and roll. They pride for their hand roll made to order but again, too much rice and big roll for me. They are packed on lunch and I can't imagine how it will be for dinner.",

If you are looking for the $12 per piece sushi bar flavor or experience, you're not going to get that at Makino. You will get all you can eat, buffet style sushi, roles, tempura, seafood and deserts at a price that is more then fair.  The staff is always very pleasant and attentive. The beer is cold and the tea hot. Nothing sits around long enough to not be fresh. If you like sushi and you can't find $35.00 worth of something you like, you are either confusing sushi for McDonalds or you are the emperor of Japan and this is just beneath you.  My rule of thumb with ethnic food... If no one is speaking German, it's not much of a German restaurant. If there are no Chicano's there, you're at El Torito. Makino seems to have the ethnic cred.",

This last visit convinced me that this place really is going downhill and it will be a good long while before I come back.  Service is adequate, but the food is sorely lacking.  In the past, I have noticed that the nigiri sushi is not being filled regularly even though the \"sushi chef\"  is standing right behind the empty plate looking at it for what seems a good 10-min on the lunch rush.    Yesterday, my wife and I noticed that the rice on nigiri sushi seems to have gotten a bit bigger, while the fish is now paper thin.  They also had a soup called \"beef soup.\"  It was very spicy and the taste was not pleasant.  It looked like something that their Hispanic \"chefs\" put together and set out on the buffet line.  There was nothing Japanese about that soup whatsoever and after a few sips we stopped eating this altogether.  Also, putting the wasabi into squirt bottles was just a bad idea.  You could tell peoples frustrations of trying to get the wasabi to come out.  Are they on a cost cutting measure?  Who knows.  I will stick to the ayce sushi bars from now on.",

The cooked portion of the food was pretty good but the sushi? It's unnerving that sushi is just sitting out at room temperature. It would be fine if the pieces of sashimi were taken quickly but they weren't. I tried one piece of ahi and it was fine but my fiance had a piece of yellowtail which he said tasted wrong. Now he's sitting in the bathroom puking his brains out.  This place is over priced, small, and the desserts were a major disappointment. Either still frozen or flavorless.  Won't be going back since I fear getting sick.",

The fish all tasted fresh and you can even have made to order hand rolls. The downside is there isn't much creativity with the cut rolls, but they do have all the basics and then some. In regards to regular food, there's all the typical items..chicken yakitori, chow mein, fried rice, shrimp tempura, etc. i wasn't a big fan of the cooked food because it tasted like it had been sitting there a while. The dessert isn't even worth the calories or effort..it's just not good. Stick to the fruit and ice cream.   Service is good and the wait for two on a Sunday night around 7pm was about 15 minute. The two stars taken off honestly comes from the messy restaurant. It's way too crowded, there are too many service stations and it seems like no one is picking up stray silverware and napkins from the floors. Kinda off putting in a restaurant.   Will I come back? Probably not unless it's a big party..am I more likely to eat at a smaller sushi joint, definitely.",

For $5 more you can go to the Bellagio and get waaaaay better food, service, and environment. If you want to avoid the strip but still want to pay strip prices, this is the place for you. The desserts here were just alright. The sushi was *mostly* fresh. Avocado was browning and looked unappetizing and the salmon and tuna used for \"special\" rolls did not look very fresh. I don't recommend this place, but if you really need to eat a lot and want to avoid the strip be prepared to pay.",

The price you pay for a dinner here (around $30) is worth for the amount/quality of food you get. My experience here was great, and our server was very attentive. If I'm ever back in Vegas, I would definitely come back!",

When I was a kid going to Makino was always the highlight of my trip to Vegas - I would love getting all kinds of weird sushi, roe, and other things that I couldn't even describe. Now they have pretty standard rolls (and no eel - my favorite). The miso, udon, and ramen were all very good. Their tempura is light and not too greasy. I like all the salads they have and their fried chicken was surprisingly good. The desserts all look disgusting but they always have - except the green tea ice cream, gotta save room for that!!  I would go back still because it's a family tradition and because it's still a good value. But it's definitely gone downhill.",

    "text": "Another long standing family tradition in our small circle of restaurants that serve as the backdrop for reunions and milestones I've watched it slowly become less and less appealing as I grow older while the items on the menu stay more or less the same.  Dinner is pretty pricey but AYCE any day you go.  $29 on week days and $32 on week ends.  The parking lot looks big but it's shared with other big box stores and starts filling up right around the time they open with the crowds in waves until they close.    I don't care to fill up on rice when I eat at a buffet so I avoid the nigiri which is decent ( though when I don't I only eat the salmon ).  My aunt who cannot be dissuaded from visiting this restaurant every year goes for the hand rolls which I haven't tried.  They serve piles and piles of snow crab which is good if you can get the meat out.  I've watched skilled crab eaters suck it right out but I haven't figured out how they do it.  They have a couple types of baked fish which were quite rich, roast beef, chicken kabobs (meh), teriyaki chicken, tempura veggies, shui mai (so salty), miso soup and seafood soup...  I don't know why people like the baked shrimp coated in melted cheese.  They have loads of desserts, too, of course, including a chocolate fountain but I have no sweet tooth so I haven't tried anything to date.    After all this, I just reach for the tempura shrimp instead and pick the shrimp out of the seafood salad.  Since I only eat these 2 items, it's hardly worth my while to go but for groups going out for a special occasion, it makes it easy to please everyone.  If it were just Mom, my brother and me, we'd probably never be back.",

Normally, you'd put your name in and wait until your name is called; however, this place gives you numbers instead. Therefore, people were standing in line aimlessly. We waited for about an hour or so and then we were finally seated.  The food is sub-par with not that much variety. It looked like it had been sitting on the plate for a long time. Throughout my time at the restaurant, I only saw one plate being changed at the sushi buffet. The non-sushi food was also pretty bad. The crowding in the restaurant only added to the negatives.   ALSO there was a dead fly on my green tea ice cream. I REPEAT THERE WAS A FLY IN MY ICE CREAM. EW.   TL/DR: not worth the price, bugs in restaurant, too crowded, don't do.",

    "text": "Hands down, the best buffet in Las Vegas.  Makino is off the Strip, which may turn off some. But if you take an Uber or are willing to drive over, it may be worth the trip. Emphasis on \"may be.\"  I first went to Makino back in 2011, and at the time, I found almost everything to be tasty. The hot items were well done. The sushi was executed at a level I was not expecting a sushi buffet to be at. However, in my more recent visits (the past few years), there has been a decline in quality. The hot items like miso and noodles taste like they come from a box. The fried rice and other alike items taste like an afterthought to appease the not-sushi-fans. So now the sushi is forced to take center stage. This would work but the sushi has declined in quality too. It's not terrible but it's not up to par and barely passable. The sushi at the buffets on the Strip tend to be better than what Makino is offering.  I'm not abandoning hope though. Even if there has been a decrease in quality, I still find myself satisfied to come. But with its distance from the Strip, they really need to up their game if they wish to attract a steady stream of guests.",

    "text": "I have to say I really enjoyed this place but the reason why I didn't give it 5 Stars waw many reasons here they are listed below...  1 - The steamed white rice is hard to find it's tucked away behind the desserts close to the restrooms so you will get a smell of the bathrooms before you eat  2- My first time coming here was a holiday specifically Mother's Day they had Lobster I assume they always had Lobster nope only on some holidays ( they didn't have it on Easter) and it's only half a lobster and you only get one which is through a ticket system   3- I'm a big cheesecake fanatic I have noticed the recipe has changed. Their new recipe has Shortcake crust which is not as good.   4- The woman behind the ice cream counter seem to be having a rough day and was taking it out on us the customers sometimes she'll give you two flavors if you ask (they come in small plastic cups) we saw another person did not get two cups when they asked politely. So she was very picky on who gets what and how many types of ice.  Now for the good...  Their clams are excellent they're in a soup broth and unlimited amounts of the sushi selection is fantastic! Always a good amount of crab legs, the claws are pre-cut for easy opening and they provide the aluminum silver crackers too.   If you're not into seafood there is a large selection of meats such as short rib BBQ, baby back ribs, and chicken skewers  There's a miso soup machine! Fresh Udon too!  Fair selection of deserts and a chocolate fondue fountain.  Huge line outside when they open at 5:30 p.m. however the small restaurant does a great job of squeezing everybody in with enough tables for everyone and short wait time. I would also give this place five stars if they increased their hours and was open longer for their lunch/dinner times.  Family of 4 and one kid (who was under 4ft and if over 5ft pays a slightly higher rate) cost $180.00 dinner rate without tip. If you have a party of over 8 people you should make a reservation. No Reservations are needed if less than that. All in all good customer service buy all the waiters and when you need to pay everything is quick and easy.",

So in the middle of a busy lunch time and the restaurant was packed, the servers started taking all of the checks from all of the tables and later replaced them with different ones. The new ones were about $3 higher than the old ones! When asked why, they said the cashier was new and she was trained wrong. When told that it was bad business to do that, to show a customer the check and then replace it with a more expensive one, they said \"sorry\" and that was it! BAD BUSINESS! They made the mistake so they should have had the dignity to suck it up and eat the few dollars they lost! Worst part is that there was no sincerity in the apology.",

    "text": "I've been going for years and finally tapered off. Started at the Flamingo location, later to the outlet mall and then to the recently opened one in Henderson, off Eastern. Sometimes pretty good and sadly more often pretty weak.  Look closely, this roll has fish on the inside then the next one has the same fish on the outside. This roll has fish on the inside with sauce covering it all up. Here is a roll with the same fish with a avocado on the outside. What I am saying is that you basically get the same thing right next to each other, just presented in a different cover. Pretty sneaky.  Yeah, you get filled up since it's all you can eat, but I must admit that I've never really said, \"WoW! thats a tasty roll!\". Service is always top notch though and the waitresses do a good job getting your drinks and clearing your table. Sushi can be hit or miss and the hot food isn't all that much. Sometimes, I'll go down the line in the hot food section and make it to the end without choosing anything. Overall it isn't too terrible if you get there right when they open. Go late and you will be shorted for sure. A public Chocolate fountain? Gosh what could be swimming in that mixture?",

You can tell they use fresh ingredients and their stuff don't sit out too long. But beware Yelpers out there...they have a couple of location and not all are the same. I would stay away from the one at the Premium Outlet....that one was horrible. Totally the opposite from this one on Decatur Blvd. For dinner you get a crab legs and cocktail shrimps. Crab legs aren't bad depending on season. The cooked items may not be a whole lot to choose from like Todai because they mostly focused on the sushi section but overall not a bad selection for the taste. Might have to get there earlier on weekends and holiday because there will be a wait. Definitely make reservation for a larger party.",

Needless to say, I was even more apprehensive since we were in the middle of the desert.  I've been here a couple of times now, and the interior is always clean but it never gets too busy. Good place for a large group.  Buffet sushi is also usually not the freshest, and there was no exception here. The sashimi cuts in particular were kind of gross-looking. The crab legs and oysters also weren't that fresh.  On the plus side, there were many types of nigiri, and even more types of rolls (though most of them were modifications of the basic variations). There's also a whole side with plenty of hot foods, salads, and soups.   The dessert section is particularly impressive, with a chocolate fountain!  It's basically a better version of Todai but also more expensive - I don't really think it's worth the price, especially considering there are so many buffet options in Vegas. When it comes to seafood, especially, it's got to be very fresh, otherwise it's just bad - there's not really an in between.  Good variety of food, but not the freshest. Unless you're super hungry, probably better to just go to a regular sushi place.",

Desserts section also has a variety of choices for your sweet tooth- you'll be sorry to skip these palatable goodness! This place is always packed  especially over the weekend though, and there's limited parking space. Other than that, 5 stars, for good food, good service and a satisfied tummy. :)",

The atmosphere is comparable to a buffet during peak times, little bit of a wait to be seated and then the usual slow go to get to your choice of food.  Overall the food is good.  Only thing that I would suggest to management is more tongs for each plate of Sushi.",

The wait was pretty long, even on a weekday lunch the day after thanksgiving. The views inside were nice as expected in Vegas, the waitresses were pretty cute. The sushi was just ok, typical nigiri selections with fish that was better than the buffets I've had before but subpar to a normally sushi joint. The tonkatsu Ramen was pretty decent though, had a couple bowls with the wife and kid. The selection of non sushi was decent, fresher than I would expect from a buffet, probably because of the high turnover with the high volume of people. There was a dessert selection as well with many flavors of ice cream.   Overall a good bargain being a buffet and better than average quality of food. But in Vegas I expect more, having visited some of the higher end sushi joints and other restaurants I like to be blown away versus what I can get at home. Wasn't blown away by this place.",

Why not five stars, you may ask? Well, five stars is only reserved for those who maximize quality of taste and substance of experience. Although quality was incredible with almost every dish, there's always room for improvement to earn that extra star. However, this is one buffet, of hundreds, that you must come to visit when you are in Vegas.",

Japanese and sushi (yum), all you can eat buffet (!!) for only about $20 (sounds too good to be True!). We went there right after it opened on a Saturday, so about 11:40, and were seated right away.   They had quite a good range of options in terms of both sushi and other Japanese food. Various types of sushi rolls, nigiri, hand rolls made to order, salads, yakisoba, fried rice, chicken, fish, a ramen making station, udon, GOOD tempura, and various little desserts including coffee jello, ice cream, and little cakes. I wish I had enough room to try the ramen because that looked good. However, my favorites were the tempura and the nigiri (Saba, salmon, ahi especially).   My parents enjoyed the meal as well - good variety of food, decent quality, and really good price. Knowing my parents, we'll probably be back on our next visit.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on Memorial Day weekend, so of course it was super packed. It goes by fairly quickly though, the inside is pretty spacious, but they pack the tables kinda close together. We only had to wait around 30 minutes.   They have A LOT of sushi selections, so if you're really craving sushi, this is the place to go. They have the typical ones that you might order at another sushi restaurant, as well as custom rolls you can make and sashimi. The ratio of rice to fish also isn't that bad. However, the problem I have is the freshness of the fish, especially the sashimi. The texture and taste just felt...off. I mean you aren't paying 50/person for this buffet (dinner price was around $30/person) but still I was hoping for better quality.   The hot food selection isn't bad. Decent selection of both veggies and meats. You get your seafood salads and ceviche, crab legs, grilled fish and your typical fried rice and fried noodles. They also have an area where you can order either ramen (soy sauce based or pork broth), or udon. You can also make your own miso soup, filling it with whatever you want. They have a separate sections for shrimp tempura, separate from the veggie tempuras. Because everyone lovees shrimp.   Dessert was just okay. I was so looking forward to the chocolate fountain, but really all they have to dip is marshmellows. No strawberries or whatever. They do have some fruits available which were pineapple, grapes, cantaloupe, and honeydew. I mean I guess you can dip those in chocolate. They had creme brulee (just okay), small cuts of cake, and ice cream (strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, and green tea).   Overall, it did satisfy my sushi cravings, but left me really wanting more in terms of the quality. I'm not sure I'd come back, but we'll see.",

Not my most favorite buffet, but I still come when a friend wants to try it or needs a sushi and other items craving.   I do like it when they have oysters! lol. I go crazy for it!  Last nights visit wasn't my favorite though. The food seemed a little tasteless, especially the salmon. Had to spit it back out. We did sit at the very very back where all the employees go in and out from the kitchen, but it was a full house so I understand. Everything else wasn't too bad. The sushi, the desserts, the soups were all decent.  Side note, the desserts aren't too fresh. Some are still frozen when placed out to grab. This is a small buffet. A bit overpriced but that's because they have seafood.  The employees that all work there are amazing. They are all on the roll with switching out the sushi and putting out fresh ones when its running low. Even the women who were taking our plates were quick and came to always ask how we were doing. The girl at the dessert section asked if we wanted ice cream when you usually have to ask.   I feel like a total oinker when I leave though. Always have to try everything... Fuh...",

    "text": "I still can't believe I went to Makino's the first time ever back in September and I just recently went back on Black Friday.  The first time I came here, I honestly had NO idea what Makino's was. The only buffets I have ever been to are usually the ones that serve a while assortment of food, but this primarily focuses on Japanese food. So you can only imagine my excitement when I first walked in and saw the incredible display of sushi, especially my favorite: salmon nigiri. If you go at dinner, you can catch their crab legs, however, the quality of them is mediocre at best.  Besides sushi, Makino's has yakisoba, chicken teriyaki, ramen, miso soup, salad, mussels, shrimp tempura and more. Their dessert selection is okay. They do have a chocolate fondue foundation, so if chocolate is your thing then knock yourself out. Their cream puffs are okay, but I feel like they could be a TAD bit sweeter. That's a lot for me to say because I don't really like sweets that much. I do love their green tea ice cream. I feel like you can't go wrong with green tea ice cream.  All in all, I'm not that big a fan on buffets anymore. However, if I am being treated out or treating someone else out that loves buffets. This is by far the cheapest (yet better quality) option even if you go for their dinner menu because you get crab legs. If you're looking for good quality crab legs, then you might want to look somewhere else.",

However, I'm glad we have it a try.  We arrived at 12:30 on a Thursday, 1 hour after they open, and all the tables were full. We waited for about 10 minutes and got a spot. The place was packed!  The first thing I tried was the sushi. There are so many choices, and a lot of the rolls have a pretty generous portion of fish! The clear star of the sushi station is clearly the hand rolls! You can pick from a couple of types of fish and they'll make a fresh hand roll for you on the spot! All of the fish was really fresh and like I said, the portions were pretty generous! There are many different rolls, but a lot of them seemed to just be variations of each other, so maybe like 5-7 distinct types of rolls -- all very good!  Next is the hot entrees. There is a really unique ramen station where you can construct your own bowl of ramen! I didn't give it a try but it seemed pretty cool. They have a lot of options from teriyaki, fried rice, fish, and some veggie plates! All of the food was kept at a nice temperature, and pretty flavorful! I was impressed.  The dessert station was pretty disappointing, however. They have the typical Asian buffet cakes -- small little bites of cake -- but they were all pretty flavorless. I had the blueberry mousse and the flan and both were sort of rubbery and didn't taste very good. The cheesecake was pretty good though!  Overall, this place is busy for a reason! The price is pretty fair and there are a lot of options. Just eating the sushi by itself, the price is probably worth it!",

The selection was really good, with flavorful and very attractive dishes. A wide selection of sushi and sashimi. I especially liked the selection of salads, including calamari and caprice. The service was excellent, in fact maybe even a bit too pushy as I felt somewhat pressured to hurry up and eat. Overall for 29 bucks I thought it was a good value with high-quality food, clean restaurant and bathroom, and snappy service.",

I wanted to talk to the manager so badly, but I worked in the food industry for years and hated when people did that. We barely ate one plate of food for $64. All you can eat sushi places are better than this. I didn't eat the crab legs or the other \"pricey\" items. The nigiri was sad and dry looking. I had a few pieces and traded in my plate for the cooked items. The only thing worth eating was the tempura shrimp and veggies. Trust me when I say go to any other all you can eat sushi for better quality and service(any of them, seriously). If you're visiting from out of town, stick to the bigger buffets that are in the hotels. The M buffet is about $15 more for all you can eat and drink. I'm having a hard time believing that people like this place. Not to offend anyone, but if you enjoyed this place recently, and you ate the sushi, you have no idea what good sushi is. Sushi does not have lettuce inside to make up space where fish should be.  Please don't waste your money here! They're also charging $34 a person on Father's Day! The nerve to increase the price, but probably decrease the quality so they make more money.",

On our first night arriving in Vegas after 4 hours drive from LA, we headed to Makino with high recommendations from local Vegas friends.   Their all-you-can eat seafood selections include sea bass, grilled salmon, calamari steak, and baked clams. Their spicy tuna, salmon & rainbow rolls were da bomb.   And for the sweet tooth desserts, they have chocolate & strawberry mousses, fresh fruits, and lots of assorted cakes.  If you are in Vegas and like Japanese and asian fusion food, gotta try out Makino. And it's relatively cheaper priced compared to the hotel/casino buffet counting to spend around $25-26 for dinner or $16-17 for lunch.",

There is still plenty of other food here if you aren't a fan of sushi, but you won't be getting your money's worth. Not only do they have your standard sushi, but they have sushi rolls as well. They prepare the rolls and you take however many pieces you want.   The non-sushi food is pretty good as well. If you are a big fan of Japanese food, you will be satisfied, but if not, you should stay away. Their dessert selection is above average for a buffet. They had creme brule which was yummy, and they had real ice cream. None of that soft-serve stuff, but real hand-scooped ice cream in many different flavors. I tried the green tea ice cream and it was delicious!  The cost was around $25 for dinner. We went on a weekday, so it might be a few dollars more for the weekend/holidays.   Although it is off the strip, if you don't mind the drive or need a break from the \"traditional\" Vegas buffets, you should definitely give this a try!",

Some of the perks? chocolate fountain and green tea cakes for dessert! lots of tempura miso soups, endless crab.. well made seaweed salads and calamari dishes!  Dinner stops at 830pm. And they stop making food around 8pm. From then on, its all left over scraps. Also, they charge for $3 for hot tea and the servers are pretty rude.

    "text": "Honestly they probably deserve 2 stars, however the mean average is doing a serious disservice to anybody with taste.  We drove by this place, checked the Yelp reviews on a whim, and boy have Yelper's missed the mark on this place.  One thing they have correct is that it is significantly better than Todai.  However, even the hot selections and dessert buffet couldn't save this place.  The fish was all chewy and old tasting, and the place was PACKED (we stopped in on Christmas Eve).  Those don't add up; the plates were being constantly swapped out, there should have been some decent nigiri choices, but literally every piece of nigiri was a chore to chew and swallow.  Usually, I love the fish and want to leave the rice-- but here I was tempted to leave the fish and just eat the pretty decent sushi rice.  I will say the sushi is far better than any other buffet line sushi I've ever had, but the Yelper's made it seem like better quality could be expected.  In the end, it's still buffet line sushi-- Sushi lovers don't be conned!  The price point is wrong too.  Lunch may be a decent value, but there are far better hot asian buffets in town for the hot foods at a much cheaper price, and for the same price I can name at least a half a dozen absolutely primo quality AYCE cooked/prepared to order sushi places (actually; with this place clocking in at $25.99 most of the better places are even a few bucks less).  There's really no winning stategy here-- They have decent crab legs, but if it's crab you want there are much cheaper places. And the sushi is borderline gross.    Heck, if you want crab, for a few bucks more you can ditch the snowcrab and crackers and head over to the Wynn or Bellagio where the crab is King Crab, and the work is already done for you.  On the westside, headout a few more blocks until you get to Hikari, where they will beat every dish served at this buffet for roughly the same price (or less if you are a good looking lady after 11 pm).  And Hikari isn't even the best alternative.  If you like sushi, don't waste your money here and go to a real sushi bar.  One Yelper writes: \"One of the best sushi buffet around in the west coast.\"  The sad thing is they may be right.",

I came here for  lunch with friends  to find  it is an Asian buffet. The establishment has been in Vegas for years with several locations all over the valley, some of which have closed due to the economy I bet...  On the buffet menu is everything from decent sushi rolls (bit too much rice though) , to udon, fish, suki yaki beef,  tempura, teriyaki chicken, salads, and more.  There is also a dessert buffet: red bean/green tea ice cream, pies, cakes, and a chocolate fountain.   The place was clean, food was presented well. Only major complaint I had was the bathroom. They either need to air it out or get some air freshener that makes the trip more pleasant.   Other than that, I can see myself coming back in the future with the 'rents/family.",

The price is very reasonable...it is all you can eat buffet...so there is no limit on how much you get.  Its not your average local hometown buffet or buffet@asia price...but you get your moneys worth and then some.  Asides from sushi, they also have an assortment of seafood, asian foods and tempura shrimps and veggies...not to forget a great variety in the Dessert Bar, which includes a chocolate fondue and crepe station to name a few scrumptious treats.  Come Hungry! Another not so secret tip is....try not to eat the rice with the sushi so you dont get filled up so fast...you will be able to taste an array of selections...and definitely get your sushi worth and then some! :)",

    "text": "I am an avid sushi go-er and have been for the past 10 years that I have lived in Las Vegas. I have tried sushi from the high end places and places that, based on location alone, one would probably never even dare to try. So it's safe to say that I know my sushi and I know when sushi is good....and when it is not good. Today was my boyfriend's birthday and he is also a sushi lover. I was trying to surprise him with somewhere new because for a while now we have gone to the same sushi place (because we KNOW it is good) and I stumbled upon this place Makino while searching for top all-you-can-eat-sushi in Las Vegas that also didn't break my bank account. I chose Makino for its high review ratings and because they offered a wide range of desserts unlike most other all--you-can-eat sushi restaurants that only offer a few (my boyfriend loves desserts and I wanted him to have a wide selection on his birthday, but most sushi places only offer a few desserts).   Upon walking in, I must say that I was quite ecstatic; honestly from the entrance you can't see much except the dessert section and boy did those desserts look good. I was proud of myself when I looked up at my boyfriend's face and saw that he too looked very excited by the dessert table ( we both have sweet tooths); However, the gleeful period did not last long. As soon as were seated we headed to the sushi section and low and behold an array of sushi. Based on appearance, I was expecting the sushi to taste wonderful because it all looked so pretty. What initially bothered me though was that there was no way to tell what each roll consisted of. There were no labels at all above the sushi that told me what was inside of each roll so I selected based upon appearance alone. The first roll that I tasted actually tasted pretty good. It was a bit warmer than I would have preferred my sushi but it was still pleasant. I jumped into the next bit of sushi on my plate thinking it'd be just as good, but that wasn't the case. My mouth immediately became overwhelmed with fishiness (not the good subtle kind, but the kind when fish is spoiled) and I tried to swallow it down but it was so strong that I had to spit it into my napkin. On top of that being embarrassing since my boyfriend was right next to me, I was not eager at all to try anymore of the sushi; however, I did try one more piece just to see if maybe it was a one time deal, but nope. The next piece I put it in mouth had some type of fish in it that was so blatantly dry that it was tough to swallow without choking down water as well.   I was disappointed to say the least because the main reason I went there was for the sushi because we both love sushi so much, but when I looked over at my boyfriend's plate he had hardly touched his sushi (and he NEVER lets food go to waste, especially sushi). Even though the sushi was pretty bad, we moved on to the other food. Crab legs, clams, fried rice, even chow mein; we tried pretty much everything there because we were hungry and figured that maybe it was just the sushi that was bad. But no. It wasn't just the sushi. I stacked my plate with chow mein, clams, calamari, fried rice, salmon, vegetables tempura etc.; The ONLY thing that I thought tasted good was the vegetables tempura (and if that had been bad I would have been amazed because it's pretty hard to make something fried taste bad). The clams were mushy liked they'd been overcooked, the fried rice seemed to have no flavor besides the oil it was cooked in, and the same with the chow mein.   Lastly, we gave Makino one last chance; one last chance to impress us and we hoped badly that at least the yummy looking desserts would be delicious. We both tried all of the desserts and while they weren't incredible, they weren't bad either. The textures on most of them were odd, not creamy as they appeared but rather more jello like, but neither of us minded that because they tasted good. The cookies were all fairly good, and the chocolate mousse was the one that impressed me.   All in all if someone asked me if I would recommend this place I would say absolutely not. The only reason I even gave it two stars was one for the ambiance because the place was relaxed, even for a buffet, and the other star goes to the chocolate mousse. I'm usually not this critical and actually never leave reviews but I felt it was necessary this time because I do not think this place is at all worth the $60 I spent ($27.99 per person + tax). I hope if you try it you have a better experience and that maybe my boyfriend and I just went on a bad day.",

    "text": "I have been going to Makino for several years now. I used to go at least four to eight times a month during this time. Over time I realized I have been going quite a bit less but couldn't put my finger on why.   Today I went again. I got my plate and when I went to get sushi, there were three mexican sushi chefs loudly carrying on a conversation in spanish. OK, I get that times are tough and the first rate sushi places get the real Japanese chefs. But do you have to alienate your customers with something this out of place in a sushi restaurant?   I then noticed the jalapeno slices on the sushi. WHAT??? Is this some kind of odd mexican fusion restaurant now? I then noticed the talipia. OK, so this place is no longer a sushi place.   I went into full on restaurant food critic mode. The salads were not tasty and were poorly made. The hand rolls had canned tuna in them. The soups were just sad. I saw a few things that made me question their food sanitation.   Makino is on a down hill slide and I will not be going back. I gave them 2 stars because the food is still edible, but for 20+ dollars, it is not worth it.",

When I got there with my husband and child, it was pretty packed, we waited about ten minutes for a table that was lliterally 2 inchs away from the next table... That right there is the first demerit. It felt really uncomfortable to sit that close to someone that I didn't really know.  Next goes to the selection of food, I expected from them to have a sushi selection. They had rolls on one side, nigiri on another. also some other cold plate area. They had oysters as well. Their hot food didn't have a big selection either. But i am giving them and extra star for their ramen, which i didn't expect so that was cool.  Their desserts were so-so. Honestly i don't remember what i had, besides the ice cream, which when i asked for my scoop, and the lady was pretty rude. Ummm If you hate your job, don't let it show. So there goes another demerit.  And the prices for the quality that they put out is a bit overpriced.",

I really liked the food. It's smaller but just right in my opinion. I also liked the all you can drink cold green ice tea.   I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of sushi and sushi rolls they had. I love that orange pickled burdock root they use in a lot of their rolls.  They also has ramen and udon. They even had roast beef and BBQ ribs, which I thought were unnecessary and kind of out of place.   Desserts were a good size and nice variety. Overall, I would definitely go again. I wish they had it here on Oahu  : (",

The waitresses try their hardest and don't give attitude, which is a major plus because I don't do too well with attitude lugging people.   3 stars simply because the food hasn't been the best the last 2 times we came, but will definitely stay in rotation on our list of buffets to dine at.",

The price here is fairly high ($23-$25 dinner), so I wold make sure you are pretty damn hungry before coming here.  The sushi area here is GINORMOUS, but you really need to pick through some of it. Lots of it was good, but there were a few rubbery duds, too.   The ramen I recommend. It's not horrible, for being ramen from a buffet, of course. Some things are often barely kept warm, so eat them right as you sit down. Like my BBQ spare rib. It was huge, and looked very juicy. I grabbed one, along with some other things, and sat down. I saved it for last, and unfortunately, it was ice cold by that time.   The dessert section is super good. They are all pretty tiny, but the glory of a buffet is you can take more than one! One of my faves is the mini Creme Brulee.  The crab legs are served cold. Meh.  The sliced steak is marinated, which gives it a good flavor. Try it.  Plates were removed rather quickly, which was very nice.",

Desserts kinda going downhill too, there is always a grouchy person scooping the ice cream (or not since most times you have to ask someone to do it).  No strawberries or dipping items for chocolate sauce...not even sponge cake....just mini marshmallows! Overall not worth $66! They also don't have cut Teri steak anymore it's like slices of roast beef or some kind of meat.  Meh...Prob be a while till we go back again...",

The fish quality at Makino is not very good. For their sashimi, the fish cuts were of low grade and the color Of the tuna was very pale. Their rolls are all very saucy and the fish in it tends to be soggy too.  Their desserts are not bad though and the service was pretty good. That's where the 3 stars are for. They have a good selection of desserts.   A quick note, if you are celebrating a birthday at Makino, be sure to mention that when you arrive to your server as they will make a special cake for the celebrant.",

For a supposedly sushi- and sashimi- oriented place, the sushi and sashimi is about the same or worse as I can buy in a good Japanese supermarket.  As for the hot food, some of it wasn't very hot at all. I picked up some fried oysters that had just been put out and nearly gagged when I ate it, because it was at room temperature and just a soggy piece of grease.  The tempura shrimp is always good though, and the crab legs as well.  Now my biggest gripe - the green tea ice cream. Yes it's good, the problem is I've been here four times and they've run out twice. I'm also pretty sure they either intentionally don't bring out more from the back or intentionally don't order enough to satisfy demand. If they keep being so cheap and greedy I don't anticipate coming back.",

I've been to several sushi buffets and this one was definitely below par for the price charged.  They kept running out of sushi and hot food and it would take them awhile to fill up the containers.  The sushi was nothing to rave about.  All of the rolls just kind of blended together in taste; nothing note worthy.  No sashimi (without rice).  For that price, I expected more.  The hot food was rather greasy and just the run of the mill Asian buffet.",

    "text": "Two of my friends and I headed to Makino after a long day at the pool, very hungry and very excited for \"all you can eat sushi\" - willing to pay a hefty $30 each.  We ordered our plates and set out to the buffet.  The diversity of dishes was good, but the selection of rolls, Sushi, and Sashimi was limited.  We loaded up our plates and sat down to eat.    The first comment that came out of my friends mouth was that her sashimi was lukewarm - like, sat out for a while warm.  We kept eating and each bite was as unexciting as the last.  No good flavors, weird, congealed textures - it all just seemed unfresh - not something you usually expect - especially for $30 a head.  Disappointed, we stopped eating before we had finished our first plates and tried to think of how we should proceed.  None of us wanted to keep eating, but felt that we had invested far too much to not get a good meal.  Finally, I decided to call the waitress over and very politely let her know that we didn't like our food.  She went away and spoke to her manager (who i found out was the owner) and told me there was nothing she could do.  I persisted and she brought him over.  He told me that there was nothing he could do because I had started eating the food (well duh- how would I know it was bad).  He then claimed that I must not like sushi (the moment when I was glad I was sitting with two Asian girls).  Finally he told me he would remove one of our meals from the bill. So - eventually we paid $60 for three people to eat a few scraps of food.    I wouldn't recommend this place - warm, congealed sushi for $30 a person.",

    "text": "I first reviewed Makino in 2006 before AYCE sushi joints blew up in town. This used to be our go-to place for crab legs but the quality went downhill in the last few years especially during the economy crash.  A few months ago, my husband and I were craving crab legs and sushi badly. We didn't want to spend over $30 at M buffet for crab legs or go to an AYCE sushi place and not have crab legs. We were not willing to compromise on either, so on a whim, my husband suggested Makino.  We prepared ourselves for a mediocre meal, but to our surprise, Makino stepped up their game! The crab legs were amazing! They were juicy, fresh and had a hint of sweetness.  I loved their other seafood items such as their jumbo shrimp and poke. The sushi rolls are enormous. We always go right when they open so the fish has always been fresh since it hasn't been sitting out too long. The dessert is just okay to me... I love creme brulee but my favorite part is breaking the crispy sugar layer and it's never made correctly.   I'm guessing they stepped up their game with the opening of The Boiling Crab in the same shopping center. I love TBC but sometimes I just want plain steamed crab legs for AYCE and not pay by the poundage.  If you are the mood for crab legs and sushi rolls and don't want to compromise, I suggest giving Makino a shot. After all these years, it still holds up!",

This AYCE started at $16 per person and is now $17/pp for lunch buffet.  We still come here, as a matter of fact I brought my family and fiance here earlier in January of this year, and they had so much fun with the \"hot foods\" section. I think it is still a good deal. But one time my fiance got food poisoning. So, I do not know how fresh it really is. I would still come back, here, because it's so convenient near the outlets, but for $17/pp for buffet lunch, it could be a little steep. We'll see. It really is convenient though and pretty yummy. I like how there is a lot of selection, and there are  constantly people making the sushi, even though it's not authentic. (Lots of CALI rolls with toppings).",

Senior citizens discount too. Anyhow, food was really good, at their sushi bar there were about 16 different types of creative sushi, all made with fresh ingredients , fresh oysters, crab legs, salads, in their made food section, the buffet offered about 10 different made dishes ranging from fried tempura to chicken & mushrooms but I only ate there baked prawns with a seafood melody sauce,  which was on point with flavors.  Last, I never made it to dessert, tapped out after 3 rounds, but the dessert section was filled with fruit, sweet goodies and ice cream.   The servers were very good and fast at taking plates away and keeping drinks filled. This buffett is on the west side of the strip but worth the drive for a real good seafood, sushi, and japanese cooked food buffet. Our experience was fulfilling and fun. A buffet worth coming to.",

The sushi area is clean.  The sushi rolls are labeled and they are made right in front of you.  As you walk along the buffet, there is the salads, the hot bar, the noodle bar where you can order your somin, then there is the tempura section of vegetable and shrimp tempura.  Take your time, take one of each and figure what you want.  Then tell your stomach ok I am going back.  It felt as though I was back in Hawaii with all the Asian people.  Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongans, Koreans and more.  A great place to come once a month.  The price is good.  People say it is expensive.  Not really, you have so much to choose from.  Let alone the sushi and hot bar.  Oh there is dessert too.  They have 6 different ice cream and a chocolate fountain.  Yup when you can't have any more stick a marshmellow or fruit in the chocolate fountain.  Aloha",

I'm from California, so I'm pretty accustomed to the seafood buffet norm, but I very much appreciated those unique options.   Despite the other reviews, the sushi was actually fresh during my visit! None of that day old fishy taste that I tend to get at other cheap seafood buffets. The ramen was also nice for the price.  My only gripes were that the selection was somewhat limited, the rice was sometimes slightly undercooked, and their dessert could have been better. And, of course, the waitresses handed us our check right away. But that's honestly to be expected at an Asian restaurant.   Ultimately, I find this buffet to be excellent for its price, especially if you're looking for cheaper options when vacationing in Vegas.",

I didn't know I couldn't, so I didn't really appreciate that they didn't come up to me and tell me quietly rather than shout at me from behind the counter.  Besides this, Makino's is one of the best asian buffets I've ever been to.  While their sushi was subpar for me, they still had a pretty wide selection. I really loved their hot foods though because they offered items I've never had elsewhere. Battered items such as tonkatsu and tempura were very fresh, lightly battered, and well prepared. I really enjoyed their sukiyaki as well. The trays and counters were kept clean, and were constantly refilled. You can also order freshly made handrolls, udon, and ramen. The desserts also really impressed me both in flavor and presentation. Everything was good and you can definitely tell the quality is higher than the desserts you'd find at a Chinese buffet.",

    "text": "I've visited this restaurant several times over the past 10 years or so and wanted to introduce it to my fiancee.  Pros: I  can say with confidence that the quality and variety has remained very consistent over the years since my first visit.  There are so many items from which to choose that just about anyone should be pleased with the selection. This is a Japanese restaurant, so the focus is on sushi and sashimi. However, they regularly have several other raw and cooked seafood items, a few items from the grill, interesting salads, soups, etc. The variety and quality of the desserts is above par compared to other sushi restaurants or Asian buffets we've tried.  Most of all, this is a very good deal for a Las Vegas buffet. The best evidence for this is the line that begins to form outside the restaurant at least 20 minutes before they open for dinner, even on weeknights. They've raised there price for dinner only a couple of dollars over the past 10 years. With drinks, tax, and tip our tab came to about $35 per person.  Cons: Arriving at the restaurant even just 30 minutes after opening can result in a rather long wait for a table because the demand for the dinner buffet well exceeds their capacity to seat people.  The quality of the nigiri, maki, and sashimi is definitely good but not outstanding. No real surprise, though, as this is, after all, sushi for the masses.  They used to have raw oysters on the line, which was one of the principal reasons why I became a fan of this restaurant. However, they have now been replaced with fried oysters, which were still a treat.  Photo Design: by Billie Z.",

There was your usual sushi with the rice and it was quite fresh and a good turnaround so none of it looked dried up.   There was a huge plate of sashimi which I guess most people opted for the sushi with rice.  Not me!  Usually you are limited at the amount of sashimi at AYCE sushi restaurants.  There was some crab legs and pretty good size.  I was really happy now.   I always had to have cucumber salad and seaweed salad to cleanse the palette in between courses.  The cucumbers were cut huge and didn't really have any flavor on it and no seaweed salad.  It's ok.....it didn't damper my experience- there were other salads to choose from and they even had kimchee.  There was a station to choose what you want for a customized hand roll.  There were hot meals...bbq spare ribs, mussels, clams, soups, and and assorted desserts. (the desserts were ok The atmosphere was your family style chair and was clean.    This is my new favorite place for sushi.  It's different from the AYCE type of restaurants but well worth the price which is about the price for AYCE places.",

I was stuffing my face until stomach fatigue - totally abusing my entire gastronomic system. Unlimited crab legs, tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, nigiri, rolls, miso soup, desserts, everything I could ever want.   But you know what they say about too much of a good thing. All of the aromas and visuals paralyzed me into submission. After a few bites, I felt immobile. I feel that if I had ordered the rolls a la carte, they would have been consumed without any issues. The mere fact that there was an abundance traumatized my entire sense of fact vs. fiction. Hunger and desire was no longer an issue. With so much goodness available, it was as if a curse was broken. I was freed from ever wanting more. And that is a beautiful thing.",

When date nights are rare as it is, I'll not be wasting any more time or my money here.",

They had tuna sashimi and that was all right.  The tonkatsu soup was good as usual. The hot food was very salty on alot of the items.  I haven't been here in about a year probably won't be back for another year. There are better place for sushi but it's my wife place to eat sushi mainly its for the soup.",

I worry about where this place will be when I visit Vegas again as I really liked it! So I'm hoping my review will be a one-off rather than the norm.  We came in looking for the oysters we'd scarfed down in the past, but to my dismay they were replaced by fried oysters which were too much, too greasy for my taste. The crab legs were still present, thankfully, and if you're looking for your fix there -- well, Makino's still got it.  Sushi was good, but I'm a strategic guy when it comes to buffets. Don't want that rice to fill up my belly! Nevertheless there were a couple that I tried that I was happy with. My rule with this area: if it looks good... Go for it.  I pretty much stuck with the crab legs and ventured out into some other unmemorable items. Miso soup & kebabs to name a few. Biggest disappointment was with the green tea ice cream at the end, as it was super bland. Here's hoping that if we end up back here it's back to its glory days.",

    "text": "It's about a 3 1/2 stars.  I don't know why I keep coming back to Makino since there are so many other all-you-can-eat sushi places in Las Vegas.  And according to many reviews, sushi places with a lot more high quality food.  Call it nostalgia from when I was a freshman at UNLV and eating here was a damn fine treat (it was one of the first buffets I had here in Las Vegas), the fact that I don't have to fuss with picking out sushi from a list (I just load my plate), or the knowing that Mr. Makino himself looks like a cartoon character out of a Cooking Mama game.  Him wielding those knives in both hands when he had his commercial back in the day was damn hilarious!  Makino!  Yeah, yeah, all you 'foodies' will knock me for liking a place like Makino's...fact is I don't care.  A lot of you so-called food hipsters like spending your money on the latest and absolute freshest in raw fish.  But do you know in Japan, many high-end sushi joints DON'T serve sushi right from the ocean?  Many sushi chefs say the flavor of many fish from the sea heightens AFTER it has sat for a little while (in proper condtions of course).  So put that in your food knowledge book.  Plus with me?  I enjoy no frills sometimes as long as I can gauge what I'll be expecting.  Morimoto?  A meal of a lifetime maybe someday I will get to experience.  7-11?  Damn well better know you may get SICK.  Makino?  A middle-of-the-field player with skills, not cream of the crop, but more than enough to get runs in.  A solid contributor.    There are two Makino's, one on Decatur, and one in the Las Vegas Premium Outlets (which I reviewed a long time ago).  I prefer the Makino on Decatur since it's the 1st one in Las Vegas and I just think the food there is prepared a bit better.  Oh yeah, plus now they serve ramen!  Made to order.  And hey, who doesn't love that BIG @$$ octopus dangling from the ceiling asking you for some sashimi?  Nice touch.    Yes, a lot of the rolls at Makino are sauce heavy, and many of them remind you of your typical 'California' roll.  Unfortunately this is for the less initiated sushi person, give them something familiar and they will probably try it.  But of course, in the front row of sushi you have some gems:  -Ahi -Scallop -Clam -Salmon -Mackeral -Eel  And a few more choices depending on the catch Makino receives.  These are the more simple sushi, raw fish, rice, and maybe a touch of sauce or wasabi.  I eat quite a few of these.  I also like the California hand roll (much better than a regular one) as well as a spicy tuna roll.  I stress, you usually MUST ASK one of the sushi makers if you can have a hand roll.  Many times hand rolls won't be on the sushi line.  So ask the sushi maker nicely, and you should receive.  If you're getting a few hand rolls though, be nice and tip OK?    Another reason I like Makino is because of the hot foods line.  Sometimes I really want more than just sushi.  WTH do they put in that damn fried rice of theirs??  It's damn near addicting.  I also love when they have sukiyaki out on the line.  Like crack in a bowl.  I love it so much!  Thin slices of fatty meat, green onions, tofu, all simmering in a sweet broth?  Bring it on!  I admit I have more than my share of the stuff from Makino.  I will take the noodle bowl from the udon bar and overstuff it with sukiyaki.  Damn fine eats especially on a winter day.  But I'll eat it in summer as well.  But only at Makino on Decatur will you be able to enjoy a steaming bowl of shoyu ramen or pork ramen.  This lately has been my kick at Makino.  Slurping up some noodles in some decent broth is heavenly.  It is a welcome addition.  Dessert at Makino?  Eh, needs some work I say.  It can be hit or miss.  I like the ice cream station, ending the meal with some green tea or red bean ice cream is good for the palette.  Chocolate fountain is ok when the pineapple is SWEET.  But those little dessert bites they have?  Some are good, some are not so good.  I like the tiramisu and the cookies & cream bites, but most of the desserts aren't very memorable.  No biggie though since I don't have the biggest sweet tooth.    Price?  Not bad for a sushi buffet.  Around $18 per person for lunch (less for kids), and around $28 for dinner per person.  Dinner adds some extra hot entrees, plus crab legs, and oysters.  There's also some more expensive sushi items at dinner, like the popular uni (when available).  I dunno, but sea urchin still tastes like slimy salt to me.    I've always had decent service at Makino, servers are unusually usually women but they are very courteous and very efficient.  No problems for me there.  Hit up Makino when you want some decent sushi, with no snobby service, but no high price either.  Go here when you can't make up your damn mind on what you want to order from those other all-you-can-eat sushi places before your hour is up.  Pretty oishi!",

I wish they would add signs so we would know what they are.  Their cooked food section is pretty good but use to be better. Bring back your chicken wings please!  Decent selection for desserts.

My reservation was at 6:45pm, the hostess called me at 6:30 saying they were giving up my table because I was not there!  I was right down the street and had to yell saying that I'd be there in less than 5 minutes.  She was not friendly when I arrived.  The restaurant was extremely crowded!  I had the first table, right next to the buffet line.  It was so crowded people were crowding my table and leaning on the back of my chair!  They were constantly watching me eat.  The service did not provide enough plates and cutlery for everyone in the place to eat.  I had to wait 10 minutes for a plate every time I stood up.  Other than the atmosphere, the food was alright.  Not much variety, but I was satisfied by what they had.  The ramen was the best part of the buffet.  On a more positive note, I absolutely loved the dessert bar!

But for less than $30 here you get to eat EVERYTHING. And the fish is decent quality. They have nigiri (salmon, octopus, tuna, salmon roe, tamago, inari, etc), rolls (the crunchy roll with tempura is the best!), a decent assortment of fresh salads, tempura, yakisoba, and hey, even spicy ramen  (didn't try it but looked good).  For the dessert bar, they have a chocolate fondue with fruits for dipping. The fruit itself isn't great, in fact they're on the sour side, but put them through the chocolate and it'll redeem its values. They have a small selection of bite-size cakes, ice cream, and what I consider their best dessert -- coconut pudding.  Was taken over here for lunch by a friend whose family lives around the area. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this place. The lunch price (~$17 per person) is unbeatable and I just walk out with a big full belly and a happy face!",

    "text": "This is my go-to sushi place and is the best I've found in all of Las Vegas.  To say their sushi is creative is an understatement.  It's like fireworks going off in your mouth.    As much as I love them, I have to say they truly outdid themselves tonight.  The array of seafood was vast to say the least.  The colors of sushi prepared before me looked like art... red roe, green, pink then yellow creams, white and brown sauces, pink, green and black wraps, scallions, peppers, and so may other vegetables and flavorful crunchies adorned each round roll with such exquisite care it looked as if they had taken extra time to get everything just right.  I told one chef it was absolutely beautiful.  He smiled and went back to his work.  It's so nice to eat at a restaurant that takes such pride in its food.    There are about 5 sushi chefs behind the counter at all times.  I really couldn't tell you what else is on the buffet.  I haven't looked and I don't really care.  It's all about the sushi.  By the way, did you know they do takeout sushi?  30-50 cents per roll.  I hit them on my way home from work and get 2 boxes full for the price of one buffet.  It's a great alternative to cooking after a long day at work and you WON'T ever see this quality of sushi to-go elsewhere.  Believe me, I tried.  My husband, me and his dad were all munching on sushi tonight from Makino while kicking back and watching TV.  I should mention that before trying Makino my husband told me he hated sushi.  Now the only sushi he will eat is from Makino.  His dad told me the same thing tonight.  That was before he tried it.  After the first bite, he was hooked.  If you don't feel up to going out, or would feel lame eating a buffet all by yourself, or like me, know it would be impossible to eat $25 worth of sushi at a buffet.  Dear Lord that's a lot of sushi!  Take out is definitely the way to go.         Either way, if you stay or go, you'll still be pleased.  I've never had a bland sushi roll at Makino.  They've never been sub-par or fishy.  I know I'm not the only fan as I sat for lunch at work today and a coworker ordered sushi from somewhere else.  He was lamenting the fact that we didn't work closer to Makino.  He had to settle for sushi that had no special sauces, no crispy toppings, no sparkly roe and NO personality... just crab, shimp and scallions inside plain white rice.  Boring.  Unimaginative.  Those are 2 words I can never say about Makino.    So what are my favorite rolls?   Crab, cream cheese and cucumber deep fried in batter.  It's absolutely addictive and when I get take-out it usually doesn't make it home.  I've already eaten it on the way.  Eel with teriyaki sauce, scallions, and a crispy topping is a favorite.  I have to be honest... I can identify the octopus, yellowfin, etc... but sometimes I really have no clue what all they are using in those beautiful little rolls.  I've never tried one I didn't like, though.  That's reassuring when you don't always know what you're grabbing.    I've been eating at Makino regularly for about 4 years now.  I can confidently say that if you don't stop in, you're really missing out.",

    "text": "I was introduced to Las Vegas's only sushi buffet - there are myriad AYCE, aka All You Can Eat, with table service, throughout the city - last year when a business associate took me to lunch here.  Pricey, yes.  Worth it, very much so.  Freshness abounds, as do the varieties of rolls and, at dinner, a mound of gem-quality sashimi, including the best cuts of tuna and salmon, all for the eating.  There is already a line waiting at 11:30 a.m., when the doors open for lunch.  Seating is done with courtesy, alacrity and a smile.  Drink orders are taken and you are on your own.  The giant horseshoe-shaped sushi counter holds up to 30 varieties of cut rolls at any given time.  Tongs may be missing, and cooking staff are a little bit slow on the customer service aspect, but all is in harmony as diners choose what and how much they wish.  This is the big draw, sushi, fresh, sparkling, delicious.  So it baffles me why anyone would even consider sampling items from the Chinese hot bar.  I did, once, at the behest of a dining companion, and was completely dissatisfied.  For the money, and it is steep, especially at dinner, at $26.95 per person, I am indulging in the one thing that sets this place apart from all others:  Sushi.  Of course, I am not a snob, and I am open to other non-piscine ideas.  Such as desert.     Imagine my awe when, during my first visit, I turned to my left and spy a real, live... chocolate fountain, replete with all proper goodies:  marshmallows, cake chunks, fruits...  Even as I am knee deep is raw fishies, that dark, sweet, unctuous liquid is never far from my mind.    Service is competent, smiley-faced and fast-paced.  The Makino website is a classic testament to the \"I do not care what people think\" school of philosophy, as typos galore are the practice rather than the exception.  But I am not eating anything virtual, so let them misspell and insert wrong punctuation.  More sushi!!!",

    "text": "Worst sushi I have ever had.  Bar none.   Not a single roll was good.   The rice was dry.  The flavors within each roll clashed.  The asparagus was undercooked.  The cucumber was hard as though it wasn't ripe for eating.  The sauces were flavorless.  The presentation of the rolls looked as though a bunch of random ingredients were mixed together.  The fish was the only thing on each roll worth eating.   Even the sashimi was bad: octopus sliced so thick it was an unpleasant chore to eat it.    Service, fantastic; dessert, good; ambiance, fine -- but nothing can make up for the fact that this is a somewhat spendy sushi buffet and the sushi was horrible.  I wasn't even there on an off night; it was Saturday at 6pm.    Any other buffet in town that has sushi as a side-station would have been better than this place.  And I could have gotten three great, fresh rolls at any other sushi place in town for what I paid to have an awful, dry, mishmash of garbage at this place.  Total disappointment.",

I felt so spoiled because of the prices were about 20 bucks for a lunch buffet. The staff was accommodating and gave us a lot of good drinks. This place seems like a local spot to go to if you are in the Vegas area but not on the strip. I am totally going to bring my family here when we go to Vegas because the sushi is so darn good. We are from the Bay Area and eat sushi all the time and it's great to have somewhere else to eat at that's not in the bay. I would recommend the ramen and pretty much everything that's presented especially the hand rolls. There fish are sushi grade and they come in huge boxes very fresh.",

It's very crowded and people will cut in the sushi line so be prepared for this behavior. Also, you take your chances on sushi because there is no signage so you really don't know what you're eating. All in all, nice selection of sushi, tempura, desserts, and other traditional Japanese foods. Made the mistake of filling up on about a dozen sushi before trying other options. If you're looking for a nice variety of Japanese foods this is the place to try! Skip the salad and carb options, go for traditional fare first or you will feel full quickly.",

Selection is more extensive than the Outlet location. Same food but more to choose from. Sushi and entrees are delicious, from seafood to meats to soups and rice. Always warm and they're very quick to replace something.  Dessert could be better though. I mean quality over quantity but I'd love to have more choices to choose from rather than just ice cream or fruit or 2 kinds of cake.  I'm a fan though, price is comparable to some AYCE sushi joints, but with Makino you get that plus more!",

I remember the food being really good (hot and fresh) at the outlet location, everything was cold and soggy here. The fish/sushi was okay. We got in around 815 and asked if we were okay having only an hour to eat as they close at 930. We obliged and then started eating. About 915 they announced on the intercom that they were closing. 920 they interrupted our meal and asked that we start paying for the bill as they need to close down the register. It was rather annoying, but gave our CC and continued eating. Then at 925 they turned off majority of the lights and employees started leaving already?!? First of all, I have never been to a restaurant where they kick you out by close time. At most places, if you're in eating, they let you finish your meal, but just stop letting others in. And then on top of that, turn off the lights on your customers? Such trash. Won't be surprised when this location closes.",

The atmosphere wasn't quite as nice as the one at the outlet mall but the food was still very good. Las Vegas buffets can get quite pricey, but this was very affordable. My husband and I love sushi and have eaten at many different places, and we really enjoyed eating at this particular restaurant. The only slight downside is it's family style dining, so you'll be sitting quite close to strangers, especially when it is busy. But they have many other food options besides sushi, which makes it a friendly place for everyone to eat, for those who do not like raw fish. If you're looking for a casual sushi restaurant with good prices and good food, this is the place for you.",

But, I was pleasantly surprised.  The food here was actually pretty good!  Well, it was a little bit greasy at times (the noodles especially) but the food was a lot better than most of your standard by-the-side-of-the-road buffet joints.  The real surprise was actually the SUSHI.  The sushi was actually pretty good, fresh fish combo'd with fresh rice is always a sure winner.  I tried a few of the \"specialty\" rolls and it wasn't too bad but the nigiri was actually pretty fresh and the size of the cuts were big enough to cover the rice (the way a nigiri should be IMO).  Pretty good experience for a decent price ($15.95 for lunch).  Definitely coming back a little more often and although I didn't get a cone last time, I'll be sure to get my shave ice fix at the dessert bar for sure.",

    "text": "We have been here twice.  On the first trip, it was very good; however, with our second experience, the quality of food was a bit down... kinda disappointing.  In general, this restaurant is located in the Food 4 Less shopping complex on Decatur.  Parking in the area is a bit cramped.  Both times, we had to park farther away than expected.  The restaurant is laid out with buffet style - cart tables that are located on the far wall of the restaurant.  Tables are nicely spaced out.  Our waitress was very good.  She took care of us and kept an eye on us the whole time.  Now the food: a.  Salad -- it is okay.  sometimes it is fresh; however, some of the greens are a bit old. b.  Oyster -- this was our hit and miss.  I love oysters.  During our first trip, oysters were plump, juicy, and fresh.  yay!!!  On our second trip, it was not too fresh at all... small and not appealing c.  Snow crab legs -- extremely disappointing.   Did they happen to buy anorexic Snow Crabs?  These things were frail and thin... Honestly, both trips, I was a bit shocked.  Being a seafood lover, I was sadly disappointed. d.  Sushi -- this is why you are here.  They have a good assortment of sushi to choose from.  I prefer sushi with \"eel\" in it.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a selection (they have only like 2-3 eel dishes).  Overall, the sushi is fresh, it is good as well.  In summary, I took the average of both my visits and came to a 3 star.  Maybe, 3.25 is more fitting.  For 25 bucks a person, I would prefer some other places though.... I would recommend instead:  -- If you like crab legs, hands down, go to Asia Buffet off of Eastern Avenue for only like 19.99 on Fri or Sat -- these things are plump there.  Also, oysters are amazing. -- If you like sushi, this place is fine.  However, the better place is Sushi-mon (corner of Maryland and Silverado)~ 27 bucks per person.  Cheers and good dining!",

    "text": "I enjoyed a meal at Makino years ago, so I decided to return on a recent trip.   It was Father's Day (June 16th 2013) so I checked the website to get the hours and prices, and decided to go early to avoid the crowd.  According to the website the Irvine location would be slightly higher priced but they would be offering King crab legs (instead of just snow crab legs), but the Las Vegas locations would have a normal menu and pricing.  I arrived to find a paper sign noting the price was jacked by $2/pp simply because it was Fathers Day, so customers were \"bait and switched\" at the door.  And no King crab legs.  Since I'm alone I'm seated by the door and hostess/cashier, which is fine for me.  The sushi is good but the tempura sauce tastes weird/bitter, and eventually I start to feel ill.  Having eaten nothing else all day, it could only be the Makino food.  As I get out my credit card to make a quick exit, the waitress rushes over to take it from me, despite the fact that the cashier station is 6 feet in front of me.    She seems to process my transaction, but then gets into a long chat with the cashier (at least 2 minutes) while I am sitting there feeling worse by the minute.  She finally turns around, realizes that I am staring at her while she ignores her customer, and quickly brings the receipt to me to sign.  Between feeling ill and being annoyed that instead of just paying and going I had to sit through her chat, I did not realize that my credit card was not returned with the bill.  I wisely immediately drove back to my hotel so that I could be near a toilet for a lovely evening of diarrhea, rather than enjoying the sights of Las Vegas with friends as had been planned.  On the drive home to Southern California the next day, I stopped for gas and realized my credit card was gone, last seen at Makino.  After arriving home I called the restaurant and was told \"we no keep credit card\", but when I insisted that it was definitely there, another female came on the line and admitted they have my credit card.  I asked her to mail it to me, and she responded with \"OK!\" and hung up... without asking my address!!!  I immediately called back and told her I am now 300 miles away so it will have to be mailed and I can't just come pick it up.  The hostess then starts to argue with me, 'you left the card here', and I replied, \"NO, my waitress did not return it with my bill!\".  She then said that she would have to have a manager call me back and took my phone number.   I was never called back, and had to report the incident to my bank.  I am also filing a formal complaint against their Visa Merchant account, since they violated the terms of service and acted inappropriately when their error was show to them.  So.... If you enjoy bad service, management that KEEPS your credit card, gouges customers on Fathers' Day, and serves food that causes diarrhea, Makino Decator is the place for you!",

Makino's is more a \"seafood\" type of buffet with sushi, sashami and asian inspired dishes. The first time we came here the nigri was good, salmon was definitely the freshest. Yesterday's nigri was better than the time before. I'm not a big fan of the rolls as it fills you up quickly and there's just too much sauce. However, Makino's does try to compensate for that by putting two of the same rolls out one with sauce and one without. I haven't tried anything there that was not sushi besides the udon. Dessert is ok, nothing too crazy....there is a chocolate fountain and shaved ice for those with a sweet tooth. Overall, Makino's is a good place to go for those that want a good deal for quick sushi/seafood.",

I would much rather have the sauce in a squeeze bottle and let me put it on myself OR have them make the same roll with and without the sauce for those that don't want it.  Not every sushi roll needs sauce.  Their apps, salads and hot entrees are typically VERY good and a nice variety.  Service is never an issue here and they are very friendly and always re filling my drink and cleaning off my plates.    Is this place the best? No. But it's far from being the worst.  It's definitely a little bit above average in quality/food.  I go back on occasion but that's about it.",

    "text": "First time at Makino the pictures from other peoples reviews had my mouth watering to go, I first tried a plate of various Sushis all the options and toppings were great however I was a little let down that they did not have my favorite \"eel\" available that dinner it was overall good and most tasted fresh. I then tried the oyster and mussels they were both delicious as well as the crab legs with a hot pot of butter right there ready for your taking but the crab legs do come cold just a quick note if you do prefer them warm at a buffet; these ones come on ice however they have the crab openers ready on your table. I also tried some sliced steak and ribs, the ribs tasted a little left out from lunch or reheated but the sliced steak was yummy. The fried rice was good the noodles right next to them weren't my taste but others might like it. Also the assortment of different salads was great nice and full of dressing. Now the fun part I tried a couple different deserts my favorite was the Creme brulee, green tea ice cream and of course the chocolate fountain try as much as you can they have all kinds of different ice cream to. It was overall good for the price some dishes weren't as fresh as I would of liked I'm from Seattle so I'm used to really fresh seafood but for Vegas this is a good choice the decor is pretty plain and it's kind of awkward when your placed right by the food but your trying so much food I'm sure it will be hard to notice after a while and the big octopus in the corner is pretty cool sure you'll find a couple things you like hope this was helpful.",

    "text": "I'm probably biased with Makinos since that is like my favorite AYCE sushi joint there, but man I love this place...Anytime and every time I'm in Vegas, you know you can count on me visiting one of the Makino locations for sure!  For those of you who read my other Makino review (located in the heart of the LV Fashion Outlets), know that the variety of sushi at this place is just terrific!  If you were to compare Makinos to the likes of Todai, Onami, etc... I'm telling you Makino will blow it out of the water!    So this Makino branch on Decatur'Flamingo is suppose to be the original Makinos that has set foot in Vegas.  For those who don't know, Mr. Makino was (I believe) the founder of Todai... then later when the quality was not up to par or as he has intended he decided to sell the chain and create Makino in Vegas instead to keep his sushi legacy going.  So let's get back on track to the sushi part of the story...    What don't you want? What can't you get?  It's got everything here!  6 different types of California rolls, 10 types of fusion rolls, 10 types of nigiri, and a few other deep fried sushi for those of you who loves anything fried... the best part about Makinos?  The menu is not set and it changes daily... so let the imagination creation run wide my sushi chefs!  (numbers are approximations but it is quite vast for sure!)  I can't tell you which rolls are good but I'm a sucker for fusion sushi..  (I'm not all that into the good old traditional styles so you can definitely call me biased on that!)  So majority of them are all very tasty!  (I just skip those that has cream cheese in them because sushi don't taste right with cream cheese in my mind)  So try them all and let me know which is your favorite!    Then for those who are not keen on sushi there's a lot more you can work with!  They've got cold salad selections (about 5 kinds), assorted hot foods for you to choose from ranging from teriyaki chicken, sukiyaki beef, deep fried tofu, steam fish, miso soup, beef ribs, gyoza, fried rice, yakisoba, steam veggies, udon noodle soup, clams, mussels, tempura veggies, and my favorite of them all, the tempura shrimp!  (These shrimps are so amazing! and it would be worth it already if you just sit there and down about 50 of them!!!  LOL!)  Lastly, let's not forget about the desserts!  A decent selection of baked goods are available but the one of the tastier selection is the almond jello!  So rich in almond flavor.. yum!  And of course we can't forget about the ice cream parlor!!!  Red Bean ice cream is the way to go here!  Just simply delicious if you have never tried red bean ice cream!  (They also have vanilla, chocolate, green tea, and occasionally, a couple other flavors such as strawberry or cookies n' cream)  So for those of you who are sushi specialists and not really caring much about how much it would cost to have 3 tiny plates of sushi presented in front of you, this is definitely not the place for you!  However, if you are down for a good, tasty, and fresh AYCE sushi that won't break your bank, Makino's is highly recommend.  It does take a little drive out of the strip but compared to the usual buffets in Vegas, this is definitely well worth the quick sight-seeing trip!",

Now that I have something to compare Makino to, I personally think it is sort o' getting played out.    Even though, this Godzilla of a sushi buffet will never get less than five as long as I'm yelping.  The extensive selection on sushi, fried foods, crab legs and dessert is still top notch.  I was deflowered by Makino in the aspect of sushi.  Makino will always be my first!",

It's a buffet place and when you are cranking out the food in a buffet, it's usually not the best and that was my experience when I was here for dinner. They had lots of different sushi options to pick from, but sadly none of them were labeled. The few sushi pieces I did have just didn't have the quality and freshness that I'm used to. The rest of the buffet food was subpar. Lots of rude tourist also doesn't help the overall experience. We were seated in this landing area and they had two tables blocking much of the step up/down, which made it very difficult to get in and out. Just overall a bad experience and given that it was $30, definitely not worth it in my opinion.",

    "text": "My friends and I were looking for a new place to try in Vegas, so on a whim, we asked one of our cab drivers if he had any recommendations. After all, most of our best recommendations for places to eat in Vegas have come from locals. He said if we like sushi (and we love it), we should try Makino!  I'm always a little wary of sushi buffets because let's face it, raw fish that's left out for a while... not the most appetizing thing. But I was pleasantly surprised by my trip to Makino-- I think we all were!   I can see why there may be negative reviews, but for us, the sushi and sashimi were refreshed regularly (thank goodness!) and was really quite delicious. They had a good mix of sushi and non-sushi items, which was good for the members of our party who were not as big sushi fans as the rest of us were. They have an udon noodle station, and really scrumptious mussels!  And even though this place is AYCE sushi, I have to talk about the desserts. Chocolate fondue fountain? Green tea ice cream? And fresh fruit (I am a fruit monster)? Love. The green tea ice cream is super yums, though the annoying thing is you have to wait for someone to get it for you, so try and go when there's no line.  Location-wise, it's sort of off the strip, but we could see the sign for it from our room at Palms Place, so if you're staying at the Palms, definitely go check it out!  tl;dr: Surprisingly yummy AYCE sushi/sashimi! We were all really full, and really pleased. Also, no one in our party of 12 got sick.",

They offer a very nice variety of sushi, a salad bar, plenty of cooked Japanese style dishes, and delectable desserts that you can enjoy as well. I recommend going there for lunch on the weekdays  because you can get the most bang for your buck (M-Th 11:30am-2:00pm =  $15.95, Fri-Sun 11:30am-3:00pm + holiday = $16.95 ). However if you decide to go there for dinner there will be even more goodies at the buffet such as crab legs, oysters, shrimp cocktail and sashimi (M-Th = $24.95, Fri-Sun + holiday = $26.95).   Service was friendly and excellent. They came by fairly frequently and cleared off our table as we got up for seconds and thirds. Will definitely come back again to gorge myself silly on sushi.",

    "text": "I love this place. In terms of quality from what you would get from an all-you-can-eat location, it's pretty top notch. The fish cuts are always nice and thick, the fish-to-rice ratio is great (though sometimes certain kinds like scallop nigiri are heavy on the rise), and the fish itself is always fresh. If you're a salmon lover, you'll love it here, as they have nice, fatty salmon cuts that most places often don't (at least consistently).   The rolls are tasty and varied, with your common ones like California and Philadelphia, and many other more unique ones.   Their appetizers are always of great quality, and have a wide selection.  Two things that really make it for me here compared to other places:  Being a buffet, you can get more whenever you want. Many sushi places in town have very poor service, and will often either take a long time to get your orders to you, or completely forget some of items you. Definitely never a problem here. On top of that, the servers here are attentive with your drink orders so your cup will never go dry unless requested.  The other is that they have all-you-can-eat oysters, crab legs, and sashimi on their dinner menu. I'm not familiar with any other sushi place in town that offers this. Being able to stuff yourself with these for $30 is a pretty incredible value.  The only bad things about it are it gets VERY crowded during peak lunch and dinner hours, and that they close a little a little too early (9pm) compared to other restaurants. If there's a long wait for dinner (sometimes it's a half hour wait or more), depending on when you get there, you won't have much time to eat at your own pace.  Those things excluded, I definitely recommend it and consider it one of my favorite places.",

My favorite would have to be the soup noodles, udon or ramen tonkotsu or shoyu broth. Cheaper than most the buffets on the strip but a 15 min taxi from the strip to get to Makino.

Satisfied   Selection: lots of sushi, noodle soups, seafood , chicken, ribs, short ribs, dessert bar.  Service staff: was nice. Attentive , but to note we were there 20 min after dinner started.

    "text": "Oh man, this place used to be soo good with great quality seafood. It has truly gone downhill in the past 2 years.  First of all, this place is ALWAYS packed! So you're probably thinking, \"hey, this place mustn't be too bad then?\" Wrong. The tables are so close together, with some only being inches apart. This means in an already packed restaurant, you gotta worry about tiny spaces to pac-man your way through, as well as learning to cope with strangers getting into your personal space. One time, there was a man sitting at the table next to me who just stared at me dead on while I ate. And because our tables were practically connected, I could also hear him chew his food. *quivers*  As for the food, the sushi is really nothing special. The salmon sometimes taste like metal and the rice can be a little hard, almost crusty-like. Some of their other dishes are also pretty oily (i.e. the noodles). I think the only standouts are their mussels and self-serve soup. As for desserts, their cakes are quite dry and stale so I recommend just sticking to the chocolate fountain and fruit if I were you.   Besides that, the service is always on point when I come here, always refilling our drink every 10 minutes and leaving lots of napkins at our table (i love it when they do that) .",

The offer soups, several seafood salads and grilled fish. The dessert area is actually the best thing to eat to me. I'm not to sure about a sushi roll with tuna fish? Is that just being too lazy? My husband likes it here because it's all you can eat. For me I would go eat else where so every time he mentions eating here, I cringe.",

The wait for my large group of 10 people was only about 25 minutes and we managed to get seated and start eating pretty quickly. The food selection was pretty decent. Some of the sushi lacked some flavor, like the regular maguro tuna, and some of the others were a bit slimier than they should have been (squid). Nevertheless, for an all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet, the sushi was surprisingly decent (sushi/sashimi buffets generally never end well with me). The ramen bar was actually also surprisingly decent - I tried their tonkotsu ramen and udon and they were both pretty great. I would try to skip out on some of the maki rolls that aren't worth your dollar (california rolls - why?) and just go get yourself a hand roll instead.",

    "text": "Ok, there are probably much better sushi buffets or AYCE joints around town but for the price you really can't beat Makino. Now that the Premium Outlets location closed, I decided to come to this one. It's been a while since I last visited this location and was probably way back when they first opened it.   We walked in at around 12:30 PM and were immeidately seated. We noticed that the restaurant was super cramped and crowded compared to the old outlet location, mainly because the space is smaller and it looked like they crammed as many tables as they could into the small space. Our table was about 2 inches away from the table next to us and located right by the dessert area of the buffet, which meant there were constantly people squeezing by. Space aside, our meal was excellent and we left in a dazzed food coma.  The buffet area includes a salad bar, sushi area with various sushi rolls, nigiri and hand rolls, a hot food area serving various appetizers (gyoza, wings, etc) and Japanese food including udon and ramen stations. Lastly there is a dessert area with various sweets, ice cream and a chocolate fountain. We were way too full at the end of our meal to really have dessert, but I can never pass up green tea ice cream and the one here is no exception. I ended up stuffing a scoop down before leaving.  Overall for $17.95 + drinks ($16.95 on weekdays for lunch), you can't beat it anywhere in the valley. Just know that if you come earlier, it could be way more crowded and a line can form. By about 1 PM the crowds died down and we didn't feel as cramped moving around the buffet.",

    "text": "Overall this was a very \"meh\" experience with only very few highlights.  Getting an unlimited sushi and seafood buffet for around $17 should be a flag that one should temper their expectations in terms of quality.   The inside is extremely cramped and crowded.  It can be hard to move from your table to the buffet without bumping into other diners. There is a larger back dining room area as well, but they didn't seem to be using it very much.  A highlight was that the staff were very smiley and friendly and were frequently picking up used plates and refilling drinks.  They have a large selection of sushi rolls and sashimi as well as crab legs plus a variety of hot dishes, salads, and desserts.  The quality of the sushi and sashimi was fair but by no means impressive.  It definitely did not taste fresh, but it was OK for the price point.  In terms of hot dishes... the chicken teriyaki was dreadful.  I can't say if it was white meat or dark meat chicken as it was grey in color.  Yuck.  The tempura lacked the light, airiness that tempura should have and was instead heavy and oily.  The shrimp inside definitely seemed like frozen shrimp.  The fried rice was dry.  They will make udon for you; I didn't try that, though.    They have some decent desserts including ice cream and small cakes.  The blueberry cake was surprisingly good.  The creme brulee was dreadful.  The top was not fully caramelized, and the inside was lumpy.  Yuck again.  If you temper your expectations in terms of quality and instead focus on the reasonable price you may find Makino to be an acceptable dining experience.",

We use to go to the Premium Outlets-North location, but it's been closed for a while so we ended up at this one.   Luckily, we got here just after 5:30pm when they open up again for dinner. Perfect timing. I highly suggest getting there at that time for dinner. The food is fresher and hasn't been sitting there for hours.   The sushi was decent for a buffet.  What was weird was the fact that everyone in my family besides me had a sore stomach after eating here. Not sure what it was but just to keep in mind we eat at buffets a few times a month (Rio, GVR, Main Street, Sunset Station, The M, etc) and this is the first occurrence with 4 out of 5 people needing to either throw up or getting an upset stomach through the other end.   The decor was nice inside. There's a huge octopus on the corner ceiling. The restaurant was clean as well. The service was good. But I'm really not sure what the rest of my family ate that caused the upset stomachs.   Btw... we've never had this experience at the Premium Outlet location.   I wouldn't risk that happening again, so I wouldn't come back again. Sorry.  2018 Yelp Challenge Review #8",

    "text": "This place has been around for years. And with good reason too.  In the mood for Japanese cuisine, but can't decide on just having one particular dish? Then Makino is the right place to be. Make sure you bring your appetite because this restaurant rarely disappoints.  If you love sushi just as much as I do, then you'll know how important an All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant is. The quality and freshness matters. Buffets in general can get a bad rep when it comes to serving seafood, especially sushi, but Makino has no problem there.  It can get crazy busy here, especially during dinner hours and weekends, so coming here with big groups of people should be planned ahead. Maneuvering around tables and chairs can get really annoying too when it gets busy, since they are set pretty close to each other. And parking can be a pain.  Because it's a buffet style restaurant, fountain drinks, empty plates, and a few condiments are really the only things that the waiters come around for. So customer service has never really been a problem.  In conclusion.. go crazy for sushi!",

    "text": "First I like to say if you are just in a mood for sushi go to an AYCE sushi place as Makino cannot compete especially when lunch is 20 dollars and dinner is 30 dollars before the drink.  However if you like AYCE ramen with selected AYCE nigiri or sushi rolls this is the place for you.  In addition you have other odds and ends such as shrimp tempura and Asian style chicken wing.  I like how the fish on top of the nigiri is bigger portion than any other AYCE sushi places, and Makino doesn't care if you don't finish all your rice.  Plus at the end of the meal the desert selection is better than any AYCE sushi places.  Service is on par with other AYCE sushi places too",

This restaurant has many sushi offerings albeit no sashimi.  Perhaps, the salmon cubes cut into 1'' square pieces could count as sashimi ??  The buffet was very sparse in seafood.  The crab was very slow in coming and the size of the crab legs were questionable.  Perhaps, the fishermen should have thrown these small crabs back ?  A Japanese restaurant should ace tempura.  Well that didn't happen.  The rest of the buffet was filled with mundane American/Chinese dishes.  You might say, this is a Japanese restaurant, although the rest of the dishes are jaded American/Chinese take-out dishes.   Last to mention, at one point, the restaurant got so busy it became obnoxious.  Very hard to move about in the restaurant.   The Las Vegas area offers well over 2,400 restaurants.  Do yourself a favor and find another sushi place.",

    "text": "This quickly became a must visit when out visiting one set of parents that have semi-retired outside of Vegas.  My kids could not wait to go back to a memorable favorite of theirs.  The first three visits to Makino were absolutely incredible and worth racing back to.  Our most recent - meh.    I need to start by saying - I wasn't always a buffet person.  This one won me over and birthing a couple of kids also added to my general acceptance of buffets. Eat immediately? Something for everyone? A chocolate fountain bonus? Yes please!   The rolls are fine and fresh here. Some of the nigiri is better than others.  But buffet wise - solid. The rolls are all kind of the same - you'll be hard pressed to fine anything fun with avocado and cream cheese.  I freely admit to loving a damn good and crunchy, eel sauced, cream cheesy roll.  Don't judge. Ha.  There's the philly roll for some cream cheesiness - but not a favorite.   The tempura is a bit too greasy and heavy.  Still tasty, with good variety, though! The steak used to be so good here - but the last two visits it was just clearly reheated and tossed back out at the end of lunch service.  The cooked fish options are just ok, noodles, blah and mussels are unimpressive.  Squid suuuuper tough, but tasty! Cold salad options are nice.  The dessert bar is a sticky mess.  The only real highlight - and truthfully it's really only a huge highlight for kids - the chocolate fountain.  The kids adore the option of chocolate covered marshmallows and strawberries. As one can imagine- the entire fountain area is an unbelievable chocolatey mess. The area wasn't cleaned once while we were there and we were there for well over an hour.  Change the wax paper, scoop out the floating marshmallows and fruit.  Please.   This basically turned into a must hit - to a bit of a miss for us. We might go back, but I think we're now in search of a better crowd pleaser.",

My mouth is salivating just thinking about the food. They have a no picture policy but that did not stop me from clicking away on my iphone at the table. I wanted to remember this heavenly experience, and what better way than to capture it in pictures!!! I love the ready made sushi because I could taste away to my heart's content and return for more. I must have eaten 5 plates of food!!! Let's just say I ate sooooo much that I was stuffed for the rest of the day and didn't eat till later that evening.

Tons of options, some labeled, some not, which made sushi choosing that much more adventurous. at least I've gotten reasonably good at identifying the things I'm allergic to (oysters, scallops -- not that these things are that hard to identify), so I managed to eat without needing a follow up ER visit.  The tempura was fresh and the batter was light. If you're looking for sweet potatoes (my favorite deep fried and battered veggie), there's a white yam option. Or at least it tastes enough like a yam that that's what I'm calling it. The tempura dipping sauce is not the standard -- it's a little sweeter and tangier -- but I liked it well enough. I tried a bit of yakisoba and a bit of beef teriyaki. Both of those were also fine.  Red bean ice cream is among my favorite desserts, and theirs is quite fine. I stayed away from the chocolate fountain as there were too many unaccompanied children wandering around near it, and who knows what they're stuck into that fountain. The blueberry mousse was tasty, as were the sesame cookies.  All in all, a fine meal. I wouldn't pay the dinner price if the food quality/options are the same at dinner, but for lunch prices, it seemed a reasonable value.",

It was about $18 per person for lunch on a weekday which is pretty decent considering it is a sushi buffet afterall.  Why the 5 stars?  I've been to other sushi buffets such as Todai, Vegas Seafood Buffet (in Glendale, CA) & Zen Sushi, etc.  The price at Todai is outrageous in comparison!!  My BF loaded up on the sushi which they were not skimpy at all.  They had Red Snapper, Tuna, Salmon, Octopus, Mackerel and a few others.  There were also a handful of rolls.    I noticed a variety of salads including seaweed salad.    On the other side of the sushi counter, there was the cooked foods counter.  You can choose from shrimp tempura, mixed vegetables tempura, udon w/ soup, chow mein, steamed mussels, etc.  There is also a dessert station with a chocolate fountain.    What it lacks in selection, the quality of the food makes up for it!  Would definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas!!",

So I just ended up getting warm water...  The hot food ranges from bad to mediocre. The sushi - I'm afraid of eating buffet sushi... I've heard of too many horror stories about people getting sick from it - But, I hear that it's OK here... Nothing special... Maybe a little too much rice, but it's supposed to be fresh  Service is fast and efficient.  I wouldn't say that the staff is friendly... But it's not rude...  The giant octopus sculpture thing is amazing though.  +1 star for that alone.",

    "text": "This is a *All You Can Eat* buffet, and great place to bring a large crowd for a small decent price. I usually eat at night so prices are $20-$24 never paid so I'm assuming lol. Never experienced a long wait time but it is always busy weekday or weekend.   Atmosphere is pretty busy,tables are cluttered which you literally are too close to another party which I find pretty awkward. Service is not bad at all, refills are very prompt which is awesome for a busy restaurant.  Buffet line is pretty decent, a lot of random sea food choices. If you are planning to bring someone that has never ate raw fish or sushi this wouldn't be an example for a perfect sushi. Rice for the nigiri falls off which should be sticky, I had other better sushis. I do not memorize the full buffet line but you can get crab legs, oysters, clams, friend shrimp, plenty of sushi, soups, and dessert. Desserts are bomb, usually get the green tea ice cream.  Parking is decent many stalls to find since it also is near other stores and restaurants.  I rate this store a 4 due to the noise level and cluttered tables.",

This is specifically towards the sushi rolls and their sashimi that have obviously been frozen and thawed out way too many times. Their food scares me and I don't think I'm ever coming back here again.   On another note, why the hell does the creme brulee not have a light crispy top? Why is the entire dessert section either soggy and still partially frozen?",

When you see the restaurant from the outside it kind of looks like a place with a little ambiance and when you walk inside the restaurant is big, bright and open with long counters that have sushi, tempura, BBQ and desserts. The place gets crowded in a hurry and that's because it's a great bang for the buck. I'm not talking large quantities of cheap food, the sushi you get here is good quality and lots of it. You want nigiri tuna you'll get nice large slices of tuna. And everything is fresh. This is the second location we have been to. The first time was at an outlet mall.  Makino is our family's favorite restaurant to go to.  You won't be disappointed.",

This one seems as though it's headed down the same road.   I had dinner here with my boyfriend on a Saturday near closing time, which is actually 9:00 p.m., unlike what's stated on the business' Yelp page. No problem. There was still enough food to go around, and still a lot of diners...all eating within one tight space. They definitely try to cram as many people in the restaurant as possible. I also thought the number of diners would diminish as closing time approached. Nope. Ambiance was uncomfortable to say the least.   Now, down to the food. Sushi was sub par and warm. Also, there weren't any labels, so I had just take my chances. The hot foods didn't look appetizing to me, and my boyfriend confirmed it.  The chicken teriyaki skewers and short ribs were \"not good.\" The dessert area was a disgusting disaster zone. I played it safe and got a scoop of green tea ice cream -- this was the best thing I ate while there.   Service was fine. The price for dinner was about 28 bucks per person. Maybe our experience would've been better if we dined earlier in the evening, but I won't be returning for round 2.",

Sushi/Rolls/Nigiri, Shrimp tempura, baked Mussel, grilled Salmon, Calamari legs/steak, Sukiyaki/Teriyaki Beef, Udon/Ramen, etc. all here and all taste good.  Not available at lunch were Sashimi, Snow Crab legs, Scallop, Baked/Fried Oyster, and baked Clam. (believed they were included at dinner menu). Miso soup,  made from a \"soup dispenser machine\", still is tasteless. \"Ramen\" was a gimmick: it's there only because it had to be. Drink was not \"free\" (Sake was from $3~$5).

It's in the plaza where Smith's is. It's always packed and even though there is a wait, you don't wait for hours to eat.  Place is tight but enough for you to move around. Selection of the food is limited but it is within their theme --- Asian. Food is yummy and nor overwhelming. It's a more relaxed resto if you ask me.",

    "text": "Food - 3.5/5  Service - 5/5 Atmosphere - 2/5 Location - 4.5/5  Let me start off by saying, the quality of the fish here is the best I've seen on the West Coast; ESPECIALLY for a buffet. Usually when you hear the term 'raw fish buffet' it's something you want to stay away from, however, this is not the case at Makino.   The location is very close to the strip, so it is easily uber-able (was less than $10 for us to uber from Circus Circus to here). The restaurant itself is clean, welcoming, and not terrible loud, however my one complaint about it is the seating arrangements as it's kind of awkward to get around tables, chairs, and the buffet area itself -- although this isn't a deal breaker, it would be nice to have a more open layout.   The service was what really surprised me about this place. We were warmly welcomed at the front desk, weren't asked to pay up front (which honestly I don't mind, but I find even more respectful for a paying sit-down customer to pay after the meal). It is True buffet style, so you don't pay for non-alcoholic drinks or left-over food. The waitresses that assisted us were kind, respectful, friendly, and attentive. Very rare in Vegas to find waitresses that are friendly and not condescending or distant.   At $30 per person, you really can't beat the price for what you get.  Overall, I will be returning, and even though this isn't one of the most fancy restaurants that you can go to sushi wise, the service alone was enough to make me recommend this place to anyone.",

This isn't the first time I've been here... It was just the first time I checked in on Yelp at this location.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the price per person for dinner is $30... With the variety available, it's definitely worth it. The hot food selection is great and the sushi select It's too bad the location at Downtown outlets closed down because that location was so convenient for our families visiting that love to stay at downtown. I'll definitely be going back and pray I'll somehow have enough room in my belly to try everything at least once!",

This place would have to be one of those for me. It's not the BESTEST sushi/seafood EVER but it's great! The selection is amazing! You get sushi, rolls, hand rolls, ramen, udon, seafoods, tempura, beef, chicken and desserts. WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED???? it's great tasting for the price I pay for! I don't know why you wouldn't go back? I mean yes the place is a bit small... not as big as the one in Irvine but it's still great! I mean why else would there be a wait, right? I love their ramen! The broth is flavorful and ramen usually cost $13! This ramen is included with the price already! If you are hungry and love Japanese food or seafood, come here! You get your money's worth for some good food. You don't need to pick and choose which roll to get because they have a great variety here. If you don't like raw they also have fried rolls. They also have salmon skin hand rolls (cooked). They have so much choices that you want to come back again and try the other ones. I just think this place is great for the amount you pay for.   Customer service is ok. It's a buffet. Don't expect much. You get your water when you ask... sometimes it takes longer but like I said, it's always crowded when I go. They try their best.",

I know this restaurant's sushi is not the best but I am going for little sushi and other stuff.  This one is sushi place for sure, but seems like they keep raising the price and sushi choices got less and non-sushi food getting more and more!  And I hope them to clean the restaurant well.

Packed with people, and packed w/ tables. They don't have the best layout inside, so it feels super crammed in there (especially the dessert line). However, we showed up around 11:30 AM and were able to find a table right away.  We were all pretty surprised by the selection that was offered, as well as the quality and taste! It's pretty hit or miss at sushi buffets but the quality of fish here was pretty decent & comparable to what I've seen in the Seattle area. On top of that, most things I tried (sushi and non-sushi items) were delicious!  All in all, you're definitely getting your money's worth for ~$20 per person for lunch. If you're unsure about shelling out $30+ per person at a buffet on the strip that may let you down, I'd definitely recommend coming here instead.",

The food was good, and we were happy overall; it just doesn't scream fantastic. There are other choices out here, and I would check them out before coming back.

They do make handrolled sushi, but I concentrated on the albacore, unagi, hamachi, clams, surf clams, tako and some of the cooked foods like bbq ribs and the fried rice and the yakisoba is worth a mention.  They also make soba and udon noodles and a variety if salads. The soups were miso and the clam chowder, the clam chowder is not campbell's, it was a real big hit for me. They also have a vast array of dessert,  cakes and other sweets but they had Maeda ICE CREAM, tonight they had GREEN TEA(Yum big time) and peach, strawberry and vanilla. The tea was bagged but it was Maeda brand , now that's good stuff! If you like good quality sushi, this trip was not disappointing!",

The service was prompt and friendly, the food (see pics) was abundant, well prepared, fresh and OMG...YUMMY! The Green Mussels were absolutely FABULOUS! This establishment is ALWAYS busy (despite some simply  awful reviews...they MUST be doing SOMETHING right)!!! In conclusion, come HUNGRY and prepared to EAT!

My parents waited in the car while we stood in line.  We didn't know it, but they opened early, at 5.  Not that many people waiting so we were able to get in.  The funny thing is that they were going to seat us at the table we sat at on the crazy Christmas Day five years ago!  I would have to say the Asian people that come here are much more polite when getting food.  They say excuse me and smile and say thank you.  Some of the other customers are just weird...LOL!  Food tasted great although they did run out of eel but the spicy scallops handroll was delicious!  Waiting for dessert was also a challenge but we managed.

    "text": "Haven't been here in a long time... so came here with my mom and her friend for lunch.  Their price for lunch is now $19.95, dang! I remember when it was like $15.  This place is better for its hot foods than it's sushi.  What I really wanted was the udon and beef sukiyaki with veggies.  Which was delicious.  Then I had some fried calamari, some veggies... no clam soup today, it was a \"beef sour\" soup, no thanks.  My moms friend likes to eat, just like me and he loves the ramen and udon noodle soup along with the beef sukiyaki.   They have a hand roll station and I was looking forward to having some eel hand rolls but was told that it's only for dinner and there's a limit of 2.  Disappointing.  They did have salmon skin... it was ok.    Their fish quality isn't the best but not too too bad for a buffet.  They have a lot of different rolls to try but I'm not too adventurous in that aspect so I stuck to my salmon and tuna.  I do have to admit, they make a good tuna maki. Don't know what it is but they can't go wrong there.  No sashimi for lunch.   They have their chocolate fountain going along with ice cream for dessert.  They also had papaya today so that was cool.  It probably won't be another month or so before they bust out with the shaved ice machine.   We come here for their hot foods and not so much their sushi.  If we want sushi sushi, then we go to Yama sushi.  We should probably try to come for dinner since it seems like they have more seafood during dinner.",

Buffets on the strip are great and all, but once you're a Vegas local, being around the tourist crowds becomes a chore. Finding a solid buffet that's not known to the visiting swarms is always a plus here.  Makino is known for its variety of sushi, but for me, it shines in its variety of fresh veggie salads and decadent desserts. The sushi there is good, and there is lots of it, but I enjoyed the Caprese salad more than I have any salad that contains small, sweet tomatoes before. I also found a new red bean dessert soup that I like a lot. And their creme brulee is out of this world!  I look forward to future trips when family visits.",

Lunch was around $19 on a Wednesday. FYI: from Fri-Sun, they increase the price $1 more. The place was about 1/2 full already having opened an hour before. The spread was great: different types of sushi, fried rice, salads, korean chicken, ramen, desserts, etc.. The buffet was not as huge like the ones on the Strip but it was good enough variety. I particularly liked the seaweed and salad dishes bc they cleanse your palate after eating those fried and heavy foods. The only negative I could say about this place is that the sushi are not labeled so you don't really know what kinds of sushi you are eating. Ironically, all the other food/dishes in the resto are labeled. But overall, I think this is a good place to eat for a special occasion with a group. Good asian food at a good price...",

There's also hot food items available such as teriyaki chicken, baked fish, clams, mussels, calamari, udon, ramen, and miso soup.

In terms of quality, they definitely have the upper hand.  I was surprised by the freshness of the nigiri, and they don't skimp on the portions of fish at all.  They are actually quite thick and tasty.  I don't like that the rolls are very california and spicy tuna oriented.  Most look about the same; they just pile on the sauces and dressings over your standard california or spicy tuna roll.  I hardly eat rolls anyways, so this is a non-issue for me.  Their service is quick and friendly, and it hardly ever gets too crowded.  Parking is on site which is good, and I like that this place is really clean.",

    "text": "Makino's claim to fame is its AYCE sushi lunch and dinner buffets.  Prices for lunch and dinner vary depending on the day of the week (Mon-Thurs:  $15.95 lunch/$24.95 dinner; Fri, Sat, Sun, Holidays:  $16.95 lunch/$25.95 dinner).  The buffet line offers a wide variety of nigiri and rolls; however, it also has a tempting array of salads, hot dishes like tempura shrimp and vegetables, miso soup and udon, and desserts.  Makino does have its flaws.  The sushi rice is not nearly prepared to the exacting standards of better/higher end sushi restaurants.  Construction of its nigiri and rolls is impacted by a seeming lack of the appropriate amount of moisture and stickiness of the rice, which has a tendency to be a bit crumbly.  Also, hot foods, depending on turnover, get overcooked, tough, or soggy, in the case of the tempura-fried vegetables, due to spending too much time in steam trays on the hot line.  However, these shortcomings are more than offset by the Makino's sushi variety and its generous cuts of better than average quality fresh fish and other seafood.  Really, who eats sushi for the rice?     I love sushi.  While I wouldn't want to eat it every day, I definitely enjoy getting my feed on for the stuff...almost to the point of discomfort.  That said, I don't just eat any sushi.  I do have some standards for quality and selection.  Therefore, Makino on Decatur has been my go-to stop for decent quality sushi at a very fair price.  For your best bang for your buck, I recommend doing them for lunch.",

Mainly because I don't enjoy Asian cuisine as much as I enjoy other food.   But I came here with my family because it's a buffet and my fam loves sushi. Also note that I don't know nothing about what's what. Whatever looked good, I got. And I enjoyed it! I may be an amateur but whatever looks good is good. They also served other Asian dishes with various sorts of BBQ including Korean BBQ even though it wasn't that tasty. But the convenience of a buffet doesn't deserve too much negativity. For spending $15-20 for all you can eat, don't resist. Just eat. My review may not be that helpful. Mainly because I have very minimal knowledge of sushi and Asian cuisine. But for a guy who doesn't know much and hasn't tried much, to those who are in the same position as I was before trying sushi, give it a shot! Won't hurt.",

The food was great as per usual. They were able to split bills per table. They did add the gratuity to our bill which i believe was 20%.   The food is awesome. Great selection of sushi and fresh! And for those that don't eat sushi, there is Chinese food there as well!   Dessert is also good. They also brought me out a little birthday cake which was really lovely!   I love it here and i would recommend this place to anyone!",

The miso and ramen selection as well as the CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN!!!! Overall a good experience and will be back here again.",

    "text": "We dined at this AYCE restaurant on 4/11/17 when we were in Las Vegas visiting.  Since Todai closed over a year ago, we have been trying to find another Japanese Sushi and Seafood AYCE buffet in Vegas.  The restaurant is located about 10-15 minute drive from Elara in a strip mall.  Yes, like other reviews, the setting is not the newest and expect somewhat crowded tables sitting just a few feet from the patrons eating at the next table.  However, the food at this place exceeded my expectations and is much better than at the Todai that closed in Miracle Mile mall.  The selection of sushi, nigiri, sashimi, and hand rolls were vast and tasted fresh and delicious.  The other hot food offerings were OK and adequate though the quality of the Ramen and Udon were close to that of Ramen noodle restaurant and much better than one expected from AYCE.  The dessert choices were fine with the red bean ice cream surprisingly outstanding.  Best value is definitely going during lunch.  The weekend price is only a dollar more than week day prices.  Overall a great ACYE restaurant with high quality sushi and nigiri.  Definitely highlight of our visit this time to Las Vegas finding this gem.  Apparently according to the waitress, the owner Makino started Todai and sold the restaurants to some corporations years ago.  I guess that makes this one the original restaurant of the subsequent Japanese Seafood AYCE restaurants.  Plan to revisit when we return to Las Vegas next time.",

The price was 25.99 plus 1.95 drink, so in my opinion it was very pricy for what it was...SUSHI BUFFET... I don't think I will be coming back here the food just was not as fresh as your standard sushi restaurant, especially for the price.

A plus when it comes to buffet places.  They constantly make the sushi so it seems very fresh.  The hot stuff is pretty mediocre as well as the desserts. They have a chocolate fountain, however they rarely refill the sticks. Also they have great ice-cream, but I had to chase someone down to get it (you can't get it yourself).  Also they have shaved ice-but nothing like asain/Hawaiian shaved ice.  Blocky chips of ice with yr choice of high-fructose corn syrup color! :) You'll also have to flag someone down for that as well.    Other than that, they staff is friendly & quick. They don't pressure you or stare you down if you eat massive amts of sushi, sashimi & crab (which I go to these buffets for...the good expensive stuff...lol).  Loved it! Only Loved the green tea ice-cream & brulee in the dessert section, they nd to work on the dessert menu a bit more. Didn't like any of the hot dishes, pretty average.",

I also liked their coconut pudding cups and different types of small pastries.  I didn't care for their hot food section. I ate some baked fish, which was just mediocre. I think they should include more cooked vegetables in this section.  I wish that instead of udon, they could make ramen soup.

Makino isn't trying to wow you.  It's a sushi buffet and is clearly aimed at the tourist clientele who frequent the Las Vegas Premium Outlets.

    "text": "If you asked me to name 3 good things and 3 bad things, here's my experience:  The goods, (1) Sushi was fantastic. The detailed presentation, precise cuts, use of colors and tight hand rolls adds sophistication. The sauces complement the sushi rolls and the garnishes adds \"brightness\" (a cheffy term) to the overall sushi. I've never seen so much variety and creativity in a presentation. (2) The fresh soups are prepared for you \"live\", just say what type of soup and they'll mix & match garnishes and veggies. The broth was nice and hot, full of flavor and quite savory. The garnishes adds freshness and crunch to the soup. (3) The variety of baked fish adds a nice warm component to the menu, all well-seasoned.  The bads, (1) the sashimi was okay. Seemed a bit dry and lacking of taste (my cousin went as far as saying it tasted processed/manufactured). I do believe they're fresh but not as juicy as other sashimi places. (2) some of the meat dishes were dry and overly looked, especially the medallion with bacon wrapped. My dad's medallion was super dry, he said. (3) I wish they had more fruit variety in the desserts section. Some of the strawberries and grapes were over-ripped.   Service was also great, wait staff very attentive and cleared our plates quick. My mom asked them 4 separate times to take pictures of our party (I felt embarrassed about that, but my mom insisted). Refilled water and hot tea/coffee non stop. Prices $$ are just right for this quality. By the way, it was raining and the roof was leaking! They put 5 buckets to catch the water.   Overall it was a nice experience, delicious sushi and courteous staff. I would recommend this restaurant to my guests.",

They don't overdo the rice and put a decently generous amount of raw fish. They also have a great variety of hot foods and salads and desserts.  We've been here a few times and have enjoyed it every time. The service was quick and efficient even though it was ayce. Our water glasses were never empty and it seemed the second we finished our plate, the waitress had cleared it for us in preparation for a new plate.",

Very authentic Japanese food, such as fried rice and yakisoba were like I used to eat in Japan.  They also serve ramen.  I tried the Tonkotsu ramen, I would give it a 7 out of 10.  Not as good as Sora and other ramen specialty places, but not bad.  Udon was good, and I added tempura shrimp to it.   The kalubi beef was very tasty.   For dessert the creme brule was one of the best I've eaten.  On the negative side:1)  Shoe cream (Cream Puffs) only had whipped cream inside, not the normal and better tasting whipped cream + vanilla jello.  2) Miso soup machine only put out hot water.   $28 for dinner not bad.  I would come back again.",

On the way out, I grabbed my second ice cream cone.  The first one was green tea.  My second one was red bean.  All that milk had me out like a lamp on the way home!

It was for dinner, and when I first stepped into the restaurant, I felt like a kid in a candy store. I had all the shrimp tempura to myself and unlimited bowls of udon. The sushi was very fresh, and the crab legs were satisfying (not too salty). For dessert, I had tiramisu and strawberry mousse cake. They were cut into little pieces, and every little piece would melt in my mouth (That's what she said). But best of all, there weren't many people, and we had to come back!   Makino WAS a hidden gem buried deep in the ocean.  But of course, word gets out and eventually, there are other Makino locations across the valley.   Up until today, I thought the food quality had retrogressed. But my family decided to dine here tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. The restaurant was very crowded, but the service was excellent. Our plates were always cleared, and our water glasses were never empty. But back to the food. The crab legs were a little bland, but they did the trick. Makino had huge oysters tonight, and I ate them with ponzu sauce. So delicious! They had a small selection of nigiri sushi but a lot of rolls instead. The spicy tuna rolls were excellent. For dessert, in addition to fruit and cakes, they also served crepes and ice cream.   Makino, you did your job tonight! I might come back when I'm in town again.",

Normally I don't like the all you can eat oriental buffet because the food is not fresh, people are messy and the food gets all mixed together and the variety is limited.  That said, this may be the best All you can eat oriental buffet I have been to.  It has a great layout, plenty of creative sushi dishes, and they really take pride in their freshness and cleanliness.  The tuna was perfectly fresh and the calamari was excellent.  Their hot dishes were good too.  They even had a chocolate fountain for the sweet tooth.  The good thing about these places is you can try many different kinds of sushi instead of being limited to 4-8 pieces of each.  The trade-off is you don't get as many special roll choices and you can't ask them to make one just for you.  Still, it was a pleasant surprise and my wife is awesome for finding it!  Update. I downgraded this to 3 stars.  The last time we went was not so good. The sushi was messy, and the hot food was not refreshed quickly.

The $29.99 per person is good for the selection of food and all you can eat. I wasn't real hungry when I got there so I was looking for really tasty food. I found enough tasty food to say I got a good dinner. The grilled chicken and baked fish I won't say was good. The BBQ rib may have killed my tastebuds. I think BBQ ribs and Chinese/Japanese food didn't work well for me.  Cheiko (waitress)was great at refilling our drinks, bringing napkins, and taking our empty plates-- she gets 5 stars.  They charge extra for drinks which was unusual for a buffet/all you can eat place. I will return but will skip the BBQ ribs and stick to seafood.",

The service here was great. we had a party of ten and they were very attentive to our party.  The food was awesome. I thought this place was going to be similar to the Todai sushi buffet, but Makino was better hands down. The sushi tasted fresh. Comparable as if you were sitting at an actual sushi bar. The had a variety of rolls, although I was kind of bummed that they didn't have a crunchy roll, which is one of my favorites. Never the less, they did have a jalapeno, stuffed with cream cheese, tuna and melted cheese. It was so good. I woofed down about 5 of those. :) They snow crab legs. They were ok, not as gargantuan as the ones at the hotels, but enough to kill the craving. They also had fresh oysters. I'm not a fan but my wife says they were delicious. They also had yakitori sticks, teriyaki steaks, and a good variety of Japanese food. Fried rice was BOMB!  And for dessert, they had a chocolate fountain! Complete with strawberries, marshmellows, pineapple, and other fruits to dip it in. They had a variety fruits to dip. Ice cream was available for your sweet tooth as well as a variety of pastries. Another thing they have that I  thought was unique to a buffet was shaved ice. YUM!  Overall. Great experience, friendly staff and good food.",

I ate a few  role pieces and it was ok. It wasn't bad. Then the food made me feel uncomfortable. The hot food was below average, like the chicken and beef teriyaki. Then the ramen and udon was average. I couldnt tell the diff between that and the stuff u buy at grocery store. After some eating, I felt really uncomfortable and then I remember all the warnings I heard about Asian buffets and where they possibly could buy their food from- China. No offense, but there's a lot of rumors and reports of adulterated on the internet  on food from China. If I had to do this over again, I would avoid eating Asian buffets all together. I would prolly not come back here again. Sorry if I offend the people who own this place. Just honest opinion.",

It gets crowded on the weekends so try to get there at a reasonable time.  The food is pretty good. They have a huge selection of sushi and nigiri and sashimi. The quality seems to be good. They have a station where someone makes handmade rolls in front of you where you can pick what goes in it. After awhile though, the sushi starts tasting the same so try not to overload.  They have a ramen station where you can pick what kind of broth you want. It's really good. The broth was so good. I would recommend that.   Their salad and entree sections are pretty good. Though it wasn't my favorite, it's still good.   Their desserts is okay. Just your typical Asian buffet dessert.",

    "text": "WOW! My visit was as pleasurable as possible! This was my second visit within 3 months and it was soooooooooo busy! But the wait was worth of it.  PRICE: From my perspective it was a good price (28). I can easily estimate that all the varieties I have ate, in other places other than buffet it would be at least (50).  WAIT: My judgement is; they are doing very well, thats why everyone like their place. The place is not small, the occupancy capacity are 280ish, and thats a lot.  FOOD: The variety are huge, delicious, good quality, good size and fresh. For now one of the best sushi buffets I have visited in the last few years.  SERVICE: To see staff working so hard and fast to accommodate everyone, it was crazy! Sometimes when we wait a few minutes we tend to judge they are not doing their best for us, but trust me, yesterday I saw how hard and fast they were cleaning up the huge mess people leave on table to have everything ready for next hungry customer. I can only image the dishwasher crew. A++  PEOPLE: It is a buffet all you can eat, the food will not disappear,  they will always replace with fresh ones. It breaks my heart to see people behind their mountain food plate and wasting so much food. Tips: get one and if you like return to get more as many as you like and your belly can hold. (Not your eyes)  I Like it all!!! Traveler from Massachusetts.  --- Small update as of Sep/01/2017: they continue to be exceptional.  Employee #1 vote: Aya San \"always very professional\" ---",

I was craving my philly roll so I was all for sushi, especially if it's AYCE!   Came here, got seated right away and the waitress took our drinks order right away. I went to the sushi side first, I was looking for my philly roll but they didn't have it. I was so bummed... I tried a few of the other sushi that they had, they were average - nothing special. The other side they had a variety of Japanese food from Udon soup, to shrimp tempura, to fried rice, and of course desserts.  My favorite were the shrimp tempura and the dumplings. The sauce for the dumplings was so good, the spiciness was just perfect! I loved their miso soup dispenser, haha!   This is a good AYCE sushi spot for around $20 and you get more than just sushi. I can't say anything about their desserts, I end up not being able to save room for desserts, I care more about the real food. haha! I had 3 full plates and I left the restaurant happy not feeling too full.  :)  *Service - They refilled our water a little too often, but better than not at all",

Everything is good and the selection of Sushi rolls, Nigri & Sashimi provides a great amount of variety. They can make hand rolls and Soyu and Tonkatsu Ramen upon request at one of their order stations. It's a great place to exposed someone who is not familiar with Sushi or Japanese food. One of my favorite section is their dessert since they are cut into small pieces allowing you to sample each pastry. Request Heidi to be your server and you will not be disappointed.   I would like to give them 5 stars but they are over do for a remodel and expansion because this place can get really pack especially on the weekends and holidays.

I'm no Vegas buffet expert but I'd say below average value. Paid almost $50 at the Aria and felt OK about it. (Aria had better seafood but, as you might guess, not sushi selection).",

The server  was nice, she kept refilling my hot tea and soda. We paid 19.99 per person.  Worth it.",

They did have a huge selection of sushi and rolls, so we decided to eat there anyways.  From reading reviews from yelp and from elsewhere, we had high hopes for this place.. but well we were disappointed again.  The sushi was not all that fresh, and the rolls didn't stand out either.  They have quantity, but quality was missing throughout..  I don't remember anything on the item tasting all that good.  They were mediocre.  For lunch, the place was about 15% full during a weekday.  We ate a few days before at the Todai in Miracle Mile and we thought the food was actually better there.  Maybe their location near the outlet mall is better..?  But the other location is a bit further away from the strip.  We won't eat there again.. we've had better sushi and rolls at too many other places.",

First off, it smelt soo bad outside of the place so I already didn't have a good feeling. We go inside and its not to bad. People were nice and sat us quickly. It was very busy for a Sunday night. We go up to get our food and I almost immediately think this was a bad idea. None of the sushi was cold. It was room temperature. Sushi, hand rolls, crab legs NOTHING WAS  COLD. I went to take a bite of the yellow tail and I'm not to sure what made me smell it but I did and NO THANK YOU. I was done at that point. My husband (having a tummy to steel) continued on. Almost immediately after leaving he starts saying \"my stomach doesn't feel so good\" \"I think the sushi was bad\". So needless to say myself, my husband and my child were sick the entire night. This place sucks. Worst sushi place I have ever tried.",

The rice was very stale and they rolls were covered in avocados to disguise the poor quality of the fish. There was not a single roll I enjoyed. Finally, the customer service was appalling. The hostesses took food out of to-go containers and threw them away right in front of us. They did not explain why they charged as much as they did. All of this combined with the very poor quality of the food made for an experience that makes me never want to come back.",

Bottom line is that my family has been going there since 2000 and lately their quality and selection has gone down hill with the prices going up ($26.95 for weekend dinner). No Salmon in hot food but they had Tilapia which is the cheapest fish to buy. Sushi selection also disapointing. No Salmon Skin, broiled Eel and overall selection disapointing. The crab legs were very small and only had cold even though they had warm butter. After being a customer for 14 years, we won't be back. There are too many other choices in Lss Vegas.",

The hot items were almost warm, and by almost warm I do not mean they were kinda hot, more like kind of room temperature. I love sushi, been to many AYCE sushi places, definitely would not go here for sushi. Unless that is if you think it is ok if you cannot tell the difference between there salmon and there tuna when you close your eyes because all of there fish is either tasteless or fishy, oh and that too is room temperature.       Pretty sure raw fish sitting out and being served at room temperature is in fact a food safety violation, I am really hoping I do not get sick for being dumb enough to eat the pieces I had on my plate. There rolls were ok they actually had flavor,  mostly due to the sauce however. All those that say this place has good sushi probably are also the same people that call a california roll or some roll with mayonnaise and or cream cheese sushi, they are not.       The place was empty at lunch time on a friday, I can taste why that is. The staff I will admit was friendly and service was what you would expect at a buffet, the food however was nothing special. Money not so well spent. Quality lacking, I am really disappointed in yelper on this one, I followed the advice of some people that obviously do not really care what they put in there mouth when I read the reviews on this place. One last comment, in case you did not notice that I really did not care for their \"sushi\" I should just say that if I was rating only on there sushi I would have given them only 1 star, the second star came in because they have some good appetizer type selections such as the calamari, pickled cucumbers, seaweed salad, udon, kim chee along with some others such as edemame. Sorry to others that have a discriminating pallet as I do and ate here. This is my first review and I am only writing it because I was amazed at how far off the reviews on this place really are.",

    "text": "When I first discovered sushi 5 years ago I thought this place was amazing. After broadening my horizons and trying places like Yama Sushi, my perception of this place became a little more grounded in reality. The sushi wasn't great but what could you expect from a 15 dollar buffet style sushi place? At least it had its place.  Last night I went back with a friend for old times sake and realized how far downhill this place had gone. It was the first time I've ever been flat out disgusted by the poor quality of the sushi. Every piece I got was rubbery with a sickening smell of fish hanging around it. After the miserable failure I endured with the sushi on the first plate, I decided to stick to the cooked items. They had gone downhill too: just the same lukewarm mediocre tripe you can get from any 10 dollar chinese buffet. Even the desert plate managed to be a disappointment with the ice cream heavily freezer burned.  Near the end of my meal I thought at least the blow wouldn't be as hard as if I went to a bad sushi place: there was that 15 dollar price tag, much cheaper then a sushi bar. And that's when the final insult of the night came: the price for this garbage had increased to 25 dollars a diner so I could have just as easily gone to a great sushi bar, loved my food and gone home satisfied. Instead, I left feeling sick and vaguely like I had been robbed.  Don't go to this place people, there are better options. If you want sushi, go to Yama Sushi, Sushi Bomb, Sushi Twister, Sushi Kai or Sushi Mon. All are good and except for Twister and Bomb they're cheaper then Makino too. If you're less of a sushi fan but still want an asian buffet, do Buffet@Asia on Sahara and Rainbow. It has a small sushi section, the cooked food is better and its under 20 bucks for dinner. If not that then go for any other asian buffet and get the same quality of food for half the price.",

The sashimi was quite good if not amazing, while the hand rolls were delicately prepared.   You can avoid eating the rice here, but people hid rice under Oyster shells anyway...did I mention the raw oysters were good?   They also had crab legs and a good deal of hot food that was good, Asian stuff with a highlight on the kebabs. Udon and miso soup were pleasant as well.  Well worth the price!",

    "text": "I went here for lunch with some co-workers and had mixed feelings.  Let's get this out of the way: I actually like the novelty of all-you-can-eat sushi buffets. I like seeing all the food and just picking out what I want. I appreciate being able to get in and out of these buffets way faster than the \"made-to-order\" places (and a positive side effect is that others will be faster too, so it's less likely you'll show up spontaneously one night and have to figure out Plan B because there's a 45-minute line out the door).  A big positive for Makino is the variety. There is a huge selection of hot food (including made-to-order ramen), 10 or so types of nigiri, assorted temaki, and 14+ different rolls - and that's at lunch. I like their desserts as well, which tend to be small bites with pleasant, subtle flavors.  Unfortunately, where Makino really suffers is the fish quality. The fish there is just mediocre. I would actually avoid the nigiri here except to fulfill a particular craving. The fish-to-rice ratio is not good anyway (not much rice, but very thin fish). Stick to the hot food and the maki. If your desire is to stuff your face with nigiri, I'd definitely go somewhere else.  Service was very good. Waitress managed to keep all our drinks topped up and was very friendly. Don't think my water ever got below half full, which is often a challenge at these types of busy restaurants.  Ultimately, I think Makino is one of those places where if you're into the positives they have to offer, you'll really like it. If you aren't, it's going to wind up a suspect value proposition.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here to celebrate his aunt's Bday while visiting them in Vegas. It is an all-you-can eat seafood buffet a few minutes away from the strip. We thought this place was okay. They had a lot of seafood options (including crab legs, shrimp tempura, fried oysters), but not overwhelming (which sometimes can be a good thing). Their crab legs are served with warm melted butter, but the crab legs are cold, not steamed. They did, however, have a pretty good selection of sushi assortments. Lots and lots of different kinds of rolls.   Not too many sashimi choices though. We are big salmon sashimi lovers, and they did not have any :(  They had some salmon sushi, however the salmon slices were a little on the thin side.  Good selection of desserts including ice cream (green tea, chocolate, vanilla etc; which you can get in a cone and take to go), creme brulee, chocolate fountain (but no strawberries to dip), creme puffs, and other little cakes. This place was okay, but we have definitely been to better buffet places. If you are looking for a decent buffet that is not as expensive as those on the strip (and if you don't mind driving a few minutes away from the strip), this place may be worth trying. I wouldn't go out of my way though.",

Everything was made with care and very neatly crafted 2) workers there works! They are walking between tables like bullet trains. I really appreciated how clean the installation were. And it had good vibrant atmosphere. 3) Varieties of veggies. Jicama salad was very refreshing. Hijiki reminded me of home. Silver noodle salad was bit too greasy for me, but it still was good. 4) Dessert!!! I mean, those bite size cakes, cream puffs, apple pie. And matcha ice cream!!! Yes!!!  I am definitely going back and recommending this place to anyone who is craving good Japanese food ( hear it from a Japanese woman ;) )",

The deserts were pretty good but some items were still frozen. I will give Makino another try sometime in the future, but for the price I don't plan on going regularly",

And the price is definitely right.  And consistent, as I would have given this place 4 stars on every visit.  1.  Nigiri section isn't the largest, but there's about 8 selections.  2.  Plenty of rolls for those that want it.  3.  Hot food is good too.  4.  They have a ramen bar.  5.  The place is packed, and you do sit close together.  But I ask anyone, you come to an AYCE buffet for the atmosphere?  6.  It's all about the food, stupid.  7.  Yes, there's a lot of Mexicans making your food.  I will admit that this bothers me a little as it takes away from \"authenticity\", but Makino's has been around quite a long time now, and it's a successful business.  (Let's face it, if Japanese were preparing your food the buffet would be twice as expensive).  Reminds me of the dolts that preach Buy American! but spends their money at Wal-Mart because it costs less (can't have your cake and eat it too, folks).  8.  Therefore, for the value that you get here - 4 star food at a great price, Makino's is a top choice.",

I really like the variety in their buffet menu. Their salads and cold dishes is actually my favorite. I like getting a big pile of edamame to nibble on as my appetizer. I usually ignore half of the hot dishes since I can eat most of them at home (like fried rice and yakisoba) but I have tasted them and they are pretty good. I love that they added ramen as well. Their desserts are a hit or miss sometimes. My favorites throughout the years are the thin almond cookies and their creme brulee. There were times that they didn't have both which is why I deducted a star (lol) because some of their dessert items are a little mediocre, sorry.   But of course they're known for their seafood and 90% of the time it's fresh and delicious. However, the 10% of the time, the crab legs were flavorless and thin and the oysters didn't taste fresh. Sushi and sashimi, in my opinion, have always tasted pretty good. The only thing that saddens me is that they stopped serving salmon sashimi slices :(   Service has always been A+. Drinks were always refilled and waitresses are easy to call on.",

    "text": "I am very confused honestly how this place has such good reviews, and maybe I came on an off day and they secretly hired all new chefs that had no idea how to make anything properly.  I was so excited to come here, I have yet to find a buffet I really like, but the reviews seemed great! The pictures lured me to this establishment, I was ready to experience gluteny at its finest.    So we park and the parking lot is packed which is not surprising on a Sunday at lunch time.  When we walk in it's a pretty cramped bustling atmosphere, and our table they walk us to is connected to another parties table. Slightly awkward, but I'm not hear for ambiance I'm here to eat!   My first plate I made for myself was ok, not amazing but not awful, the items on my plate were from the sushi bar directly next to hand rolls.  I also had some fried squid which was decent.  It all went downhill from there.  The nigiri was a hot mess! The rice was way to wet, and the fish on most rolls was not proportionality cut, and was done so very sloppy.  The long row of rolls all looked better than they tasted.  I spit out a lot of food.  Also I noticed the potential for so much cross contamination since there was not enough tongs per item.  Also for hand rolls only at dinner do the offer the irkura hand roll.  In the hot section other than the calamari I tried the beef with mushrooms and onions. Most of the beef was overcooked from sitting under the heat lamp, making it so tough.  The shrimp tempura was soggy, and the rest of the tempura was just a trough of sadness.  I tried the ramen, the guy putting together did it a bit sloppy, and was trying to hit on the woman behind me at the same time.  He was a multi tasker...The noodle was very thin I prefer it curly and thick, the meat was tender, the broth was better than the box kind, but still missing a soul.  The sukiyaki meat was actually very nice, the noodle overcooked.  No crab legs anywhere at lunch, which I can understand Its cheaper.  The dessert area was a joke, it tasted like a bunch of dollar store mixes thrown together rather than anything of quality or from scratch.  Lots of artificial flavors, and calories that were not worth it.  The flan was the only decent thing there.  I saw no creme brule, that must also be a dinner item.  All in all, I just don't get the appeal of this place, it cured me of ever hoping to find a buffet that is worth my money.  Food that sits out, starts to change in texture, and quality.  I'll just stick to all you can eat like Gens if I have a deep urge to eat that much asian food in a sitting. At least then I know it is made to order, thus fresh.",

    "text": "My family and I used to frequent the Makino in the Premium Outlet Mall on Charleston a looong time ago. We stopped going mainly because it was just too expensive. Recently, my dad decided to give this place a try and we fell in love with it all over again.  Don't come in here with great expectations because I guarantee you that it will lead to just disappointment. Come to Makino without any expectations at all just like I did, haha!  The overall restaurant is kind of cramped. It's smaller compared to the one that they had at Premium. So that was a big thumbs down for me.  Service: They're okay. Some of the servers have a resting b!tch face. They just come to refill your drinks and take your food away. I'm probably really picky, but I like having servers who'll actually say \"excuse me\" while taking your food or I don't know.. People who'll actually smile?    Food: There's a lot to choose from here. They have a lot of different kind of rolls and nigiri. If you come for dinner, they serve oysters, crab legs, amaebi (sweet shrimp) nigiri, and sashimi! They also have shrimp tempura, udon, seaweed salad, etc. I personally love the food selections here because they don't have a limit to amaebi nigiri. You can have as much as you want. And you can't find unlimited sashimi at an AYCE sushi restaurant.   Price: Their dinner price here is comparable to AYCE sushi places in town (around $27).   Personally, I find it worth every penny. You don't have to wait for the server to take your order, and you don't have to wait for your sushi rolls to come to your table. You can just get up and take ONE piece of roll that looks appetizing before getting more pieces. No more ordering half rolls or full rolls. And btw, they don't charge extra for leftovers ;)",

That's probably why I haven't came in a long time. Never coming back....",

    "text": "700th review. And it's all about my buffet-obsessed husband. \"for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part\"    He claims that there's a Buffet Clause somewhere in there.   I am his Reluctant Buffet Queen.  Makino has been his WallyWorld for years, thanks to his work buddies. We made it a point to get over there on this trip to Vegas.  Showed up 20 minutes early and since it was real chilly outside, decided to wait in the car. But then he noticed that there were already people lined up at the door. And then, people were walking past our car to get in line. \"Get out of the car!  Get out of the car!  Hurry!\"   Okay. By the time the door opened, there was quite a crowd behind us.  He got all excited.  \"Must be good, yeah!\"  Gotta say, these diners don't mess around. It was like the quick or the dead. I was doing my usual walk by all the counters to see what was offered. I normally shy away from buffet sushi, but the nigiri looked really good.  So I doubled back.  In less than a minute and there was only 1 piece of salmon nigiri left on the tray!  Daaaang! Was able to get some tako, ika, ahi, scallop, saba & 1 salmon handroll too.  Only one polite piece of each because there were so many other things I wanted to try. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=VyMA0WwBNEZGOMJNFpdwxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/maki...</a> The hubby's an organized buffet strategist.  By the time I got back to the table with my one plate of sushi and bowl of udon, he had several plates filled with items from different counters.   He looked so adorably happy.  A few mentions: Nigiri-  The sashimi was good quality.  So good that I didn't bother with the wasabi & shoyu.  Just savored the freshness as is.  The tako (octopus) was especially good; sliced thin & just a bit chewy.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=wH8jGzPHkcumsawKM8MNWA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/maki...</a> The Udon bar-  LOVED this!  There's veggie & shrimp tempura right next and I made a tempura bowl.  There's eggplant, asparagus & sweet potato in with the veggies.  Fresh grated ginger to add in.  The hubby saw how much I was enjoying it and made himself 2 bowls. Yakisoba & calamari salad-  Hubby's 2 favorites of the day.  Went back for more. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=ZHwl9sFfUcB8DOfl51yijg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/maki...</a> Seafood ceviche-  Beautiful & tasty!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=V2SXkPvdLTE0SILfY6DibQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/maki...</a> Dessert bar-  Couldn't resist and got a coffee jello & matcha cake.  Was about to walk away, but that lady asked if I wanted some ice cream.  Might as well, I already knew my glucose reading was going to be high from the starches & fried food.  \"Sure!  Green tea, please!\"   (2 hours later- 215) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=lwXIaQIL9F0bRAPDAVpoZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/maki...</a>  Service-  They're on top of their game here. The servers were adeptly going in and out amongst the tables, clearing the dishes & refilling the drinks. The guys in the sushi station were quickly replenishing the trays.  The hubby's expectations were more than fulfilled.   He was amazed that I ate more than usual.  Well, yeah!  The food offerings were so good that I wanted to eat instead of doing my usual nibbling. This buffet kicked our butts.  Instead of going to our planned afternoon destination, we went back to our hotel for food coma naps.  Yes.  Return visits & will recommend Makino to friends & family.  Note:  This place is so popular that it was at capacity within 10 minutes! When we left, there was a crowd out there shivering in the cold, waiting to get in. Like I said earlier, quick or the dead.",

    "text": "For the people saying that this is the worst sushi restaurant, you do not know of horrible food and service until you've eaten at Todai in San Diego. I just had to get that off of my chest since that experience has made me appreciate ALL other sushi buffets.   The best time to come here is when it opens or else you'll be waiting for a while. There is a wide variety of sushi rolls and hot foods here. I was surprised to see that they also served spicy ramen! But you have to ask for it. I'm always on the look out for the salmon nigiris since those are usually the first to go then the tuna ones. You gotta be aggressive and grab the tongs first cuz once the chef refills that salmon and tuna, everyone be going apeshit. I remember this man just standing in front of all the nigiris until the chef put out more salmon (he was there for about 5 mins not budging).   My favorite section is the dessert. But I was disappointed that they didn't serve the coconut pudding cups the other day. I was looking forward to that. I did get a chance to try the green tea cake ugh so good. Anything green tea is just yesss.   I barely touch the hot food unless there's shrimp or tempura or calamari. One does not simply go to a sushi buffet spending plenty of money to eat hot food! I wanna get my money's worth of raw fish :)  I will always come back here. I'm not all crazy about quality. As long as it taste good and doesn't give me food poisoning then I don't have a problem.   & remember you don't know terrible until you've tried Todai in San Diego. The Todai here is fucking bomb!",

Don't get me wrong, I'd rather sit down and ask a chef for a fresh roll any day of the week,  but as far as sushi buffets go, I really liked it here.   The sushi rolls are and meant to be taken one or a few pieces each so you can try a bunch of different ones and come back for more. The cooked food isn't 2nd banana either. My favorite was the squid, which was cut up into rings and surprisingly tender. Also, the crab was really good, I don't think they freeze it because the meat stayed together so well and it was freaking tasty. There's other items like noodles, rice, meats, and desserts, but the winner for me was the sushi and seafood.   There's a lot of choices on the strip but this place has better sushi and seafood compared to other more elegant restaurants on the strip. Take the short drive because it really is worth it!",

It's not even a subjective or bias thing, it's literally not fresh. Let me start with the negatives and then I'll let you know why I'm even granting at least 2 stars.  The sushi taste as bad as they look. The salmon nigiri was stiff, as if it was still frozen but not cold. The tuna nigiri was so pungently fishy, I couldn't even swallow. Between the two that I've tried, I couldn't get myself to try the rest I had on my plate. We were here for my Dad's birthday, and for the price we paid, I am so regretful. We could have gone to a nice AYCE sushi spot for the same price.  Two stars granted only for their endless shrimp tempura and Dungeness crab legs. That's it!

This buffet is my parents favorite spot for sushi and they would never try anything else. The lunch price for the buffets is about $19.95 per person. They have a sushi bar where you can make your own wraps of sushi and ramen bar. Not to mention the dessert section you can get your own shave ice.   The food they serve isn't your typical asian buffet but they have really good authentic asian food to serve. My favorite is the shrimp tempura. The sushi is pretty fresh and the sushi rolls pretty much all taste the same but I'm not complaining. Really get your money's worth but this place is mostly for a family gathering rather than a date scenery. Been going here since it open, because it's my parents favorite.",

I'm my opinion I think that Makinos is overpriced opposed to the quality of their food, my daughter is 2 and never touched her food but unfortunately because of her height (she's a tall girl, her father is a tall man) I had to pay for her.  I've been to this location 3 different times and unfortunately all experiences were unsatisfactory.  However, the the Las Vegas Outlet location was pretty tasty. I think it's a hit or miss.",

There was some very delicious varieties to choose from and I actually helped myself to the grilled shrimp in a split shell a couple of times... so delicious! The only thing that I didn't like was that we were placed in the back of the restaurant behind a large group of people who took up 3 large tables. It became very annoying to maneuver around these tables. Considering they had plenty of open tables up in the front of the main dining room area.",

I definitely filled up on the sushi and rolls and although it wasn't pricey sushi bar, pristine quality, if you can look past the presentation, the taste ain't bad. It is what it is and you should know that going into it.  If you're not into fish, the other side of the buffet is properly satisfying. My husband isn't a fish guy, but he found the ribs, noodles, fried rice, Korean BBQ and chicken to be tasty and filling.  I wasn't a fan of the ramen, but I enjoyed watching the guy make my bowl. The fruit was very disappointing because last I checked, fruit should be sweet and juicy. This fruit was neither, though I watched one of the cooks diligently chopping it all up fresh. The chocolate fountain was fun as usual with the big marshmallows for dipping and the desserts were quintessentially Asian: a little different, light and not very sweet.  Bottom line: Going in with proper expectations you should be properly satisfied!",

    "text": "In a city like Vegas where buffets are abundant and at almost every corner, it's hard to stick out. Asian buffets all tend to be the same as well- typical orange chicken and mediocre egg rolls can usually be seen. I'll be the first to admit I did not expect much when I got invited to Makino LV for a birthday party. I thought to myself how this would just be another Asian buffet. It was thus with a pleasant surprise to find Makino LV did stick out and was different good way!  There was no orange chicken or mediocre egg rolls but instead an array of various sushi of all kinds. There was shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, crispy teriyaki chicken, beef short ribs, chicken and vegetable skewers. They also had ramen made to order. Choice of ramen were tonkotsu and Shoyu. Diners could also make their own udon soup.   From the savory items, I found the beef short ribs to be of good flavor and the crispy teriyaki chicken was tasty! I found the ramen to be a very nice. I got the tonkotsu ramen and the broth was rich and robust in flavor.   For dessert, sweet lovers could feast on sweet treats like white chocolate raspberry, creme brulee and Oreo cheesecake! There were fresh ice cream scoops that seemed to be a crowd favorite. Ice cream flavors included red bean, green tea and cookies and cream. My sweet tooth was pleased with my own dessert creation of cookies and cream ice cream topped with a white chocolate raspberry and a cookie brittle.   Makino LV surprised me in a good way. It was different from other Asian buffets and it made a mark for this foodie. It's always nice to have good surprises :). In a city of buffets, it's nice to see Makino LV be a little different.",

A few months ago, we said we were done with the place because the raw fish was beyond iffy...  Last night went again cuz SO went without me & said it was good again... Not really...  I passed on most of the sushi because it didn't look right...  albacore looked dried out, as if sitting a long time, spit out a piece of poke I tried (warm & just not right), cooked shrimp was dry, crab legs were cold & wet...  the fresh made spicy , tuna roll was fine, shrimp tempura was very good & desserts were good (I think they buy frozen cuz the tiramasu was still a little frozen, so how could they screw that up, lol).  Anyway, for $30 a pop, there are way better options.  I'm out.",

They over cooked their crabs. Most of them looked so dirty and you can barely break them, they were too soft.   The fried rice and all that stuff were just mediocre. Dessert was bleh.

No it's not on par with Nobu or other  $75+ sushi establishments on the strip but it's not trying to be. Are the people leaving bad reviews seriously expecting the same quality? I filled myself on two plates of rolls. The tuna and salmon are fresh and delicious. They have a hand roll station that does made to order hand rolls. The spicy tuna was my favorite. I also had made to order tonkotsu ramen and it honestly was a lot better than my expectations. No Monta but for a Buffett establishment, I happily gobbled down the ramen. Tried some of the other things like gyoza, shrimp tempura and some classic Asian Buffett fare such as green muscles with cheese. Other than the shrimp tempura which is bomb, the none sushi foods were lackluster. Didn't care much for the desserts, but I was here for a sushi fill and it hit the spot!",

There's a ramen bar which I didn't try...so I can't really comment. There were also ribs which weren't bad and snow crab. There were several desserts.  Cons: some of the fish sits out a little too long. The yellowtail was getting a little old. The snow crab appeared to be brined which I didn't like. The tempura roll was subpar, because it was unattractive, lacking sauces, and the salmon got cooked. The desserts were boring and unmemorable.",

I explained to the waitress there was a mistake and she asked my little sister how old she was and she said 11. The waitress walked away, brought another woman out about 15 min later ( I'm assuming the manager) while the rest of the staff begin to give us odd stares. She comes out and asks how old my sister is and I say 11 then she asks her what year she was born, then drags her over to the front of the restaraunt to have her MEASURED embarrassing her in front of everyone. Needless to say we got the half off discount for her but this was so unnecessary. Also the food was mediocre. 4 people came out to $136.00 for seafood that's been sitting out all day. Never again! Creme brulee was bland, sushi tasted fishy, crab legs had no meat in them, gave us ice tea with an orange? Music sucked and staff was rude",

    "text": "Service is pretty good here and there is a good selection of sushi. I also saw fried oysters, mussels and crab legs. I think they also have a ramen/noodle station and a hand roll station (limit 2 per person per order). While the sushi selection was good, and they also had nigiri, the fish wasn't very fresh, especially the tuna. The rolls tasted like ones that you can buy at Costco or smiths which is unfortunate. They also tended to put a lot of cream cheese in their some of their rolls. I did enjoy the salmon nigiri and eel nigiri. My bf ate about 4 plates of their crab legs. I was surprised that they had glass noodles and Kim chi, but both weren't very good.   They also have a very small selection of desserts and I thought drinks would be included but soft drinks are $1.75 extra. The servers are really good at refilling your drinks.   The place does get packed.... we arrive at 6 and by 7, it was completely full. Dinner pricing was $28.95 which is on the expensive side considering AYCE sushi spots offer a better selection and better quality. Also, with so many buffet options on the strip (and off strip), I probably won't be back.",

Rice to fish ratio on sushi is great, not a big ball of rice. Rolls selection was good too. And they keep refilling very fast. They also serve salads and hot food like tempuras and fried rice.   I really like the make to order hand rolls and noodle station. They also have ice cream, desert and fruits. Soda is included in price but not hot tea or juice.   Considering the price, it is a great place to eat. I don't expect to get top quality when they only charge like 20 bucks a head and give you a load of good quality food to choose from. The service is also good as well. Dirty plates get pick up very fast and I never needed to ask for a drink refill.",

For $28.95/adult on a Thursday night, I think that's a good deal given that it is mainly seafood and it's all-you-can-eat. There are only very few items that I disliked. I would come again and I recommend it.  PROS: + Sushi (\"above average\" to \"good\") + Other Seafood, like Shrimp Tempura and Prawns + Dessert is bomb, especially the green tea ice cream + Free parking in the plaza + Friendly service & Attentive   CONS:  May have a higher risk of cross-contamination because they leave out the tongs for 1-3 different food items   Seating is kinda terrible, but it is a buffet. The tables are cramped together, so people sitting with their chairs out doesn't help. You're bound to run into a couple of people.",

I left in probably the most painful food coma of my life. Why? Ceviche! It was absolutely delicious! I had to have multiple servings it was so tasty.  Personally, I much prefer this buffet style to regular AYCE places because I like to try a single piece of a lot of stuff, rather than a whole roll. I tried a piece that was just a tentacle of something on a square of rice. No idea what animal  the tentacle orignated from, but it was okay. No real flavor, and luckily not the texture I had imagined.  I tried a hand roll for the first time, it was heavy on the rice and the raw enoki mushrooms were strangely overpowering. Luckily, unlike AYCE places, as long as you're not visibly wasting vast quantities of food, peeling off some rice or leaving some things you don't like on your plate won't result in an extra charge on your bill.  I enjoyed pretty much everything I tried - which was like three plates worth of food. Desserts were really good and I especially like the coffee jello and what tasted like huapia.",

The reason is they don't have prices for rolls to go.  Yet they sell these rolls in their restaurant.  Bizarre.  They don't want people to order more food and spend more money.",

    "text": "Normally, I really don't like Asian buffets like this at all. So, I have a really hard time deciding..do I like it? Granted, I still -don't- like Asian buffets overall. But, I would have to say that Makino is probably the prized gem of all Oriental Buffets in Las Vegas--at the same time, the experience and food that I encountered was average.  Ambiance: 3 - For an oriental buffet, most of which are small..Makino presents a pretty large and spacious serving area and seating space. Though, the seats can get a bit overcrowded and it can be hard walking through aisles when the place is full!   Inside, it's pretty casual--I mean, it is a buffet after all!   Service: 4 - The service received was quick and responsive. Our server was attentive and patient with my (rather rowdy) family hah! She was always there to take away our plates and bring us more water. Our table was always pretty clean! She deserves a gold star!!   Food: 3 - The only food thats worth eating at Makino is clearly the seafood. Though, it might not be the best, if you're there it's still pretty good! For the sushi, obviously, there are way better, fresher places for the fish. I personally do not recommend it, but a few rolls are worth a try if you happen to find yourself at Makino!   What I do recommend eating is crab legs and oysters (raw). Naturally, this is what everyone is here for!! And they don't disappoint--especially with their (what I consider) \"king-sized\" cups of butter for crab dipping! I was just there for crab legs and oysters. Hell, I was good for the night because that's all I needed!   //Note: the crab legs were served warm when I was there!   Another thing that was pretty nice was their desserts! I'm in love with desserts and found it cute and party-like that they had a chocolate fountain and fresh strawberries, along with their selections of cake and ice cream. Yeah, I found the diversity of dessert nice, but it still tasted average :/ maybe next time it'll be better!   If all you like at oriental buffets are crabs and oysters, your life will be complete! Fill your butter cup and chow down!",

And we hadn't been there since, until a few sundays ago, to celebrate my sister's birthday (cinco de mayo- we work so we couldn't go out on monday).  I made a reservation for our large party- 14 of us (my mom, my siblings & their children, only one missing was my brother-in-law). Good thing, too, because when we went to the door, before it even opened (11:30 am), there were about 30 people standing to get inside. Busy lunch time crowd. The staff managed well. We were seated in the back part. We had a high chair, but our little one was sleeping. (We woke him after he had a nap so he could enjoy some fried rice and teriyaki chicken.)  Food was fresh (all the cooks were busy), there was a sushi station, salad section, hot foods section, (personalized section- you select the veggies) & a dessert section (ice cream is handled by the attendant). I liked the many different selections but I was trying to keep myself comfortable, so I was being picky, but I was satisfied. I wanted some Kale Salad, and then upon closer inspection, noticed that I got a lot of the thick stems (next time, I'm gonna be that annoying person that picks at it, avoiding the stems. For the most part, I ate what I selected, and I enjoyed my food. I also saved room for dessert. I got the green tea ice cream but it was a little off (then again, it almost always is, at these places, unless you go to a specialty ice cream place).   My husband just thought it was OK, but thought it was a little high-priced, and actually likes Todai better (no doubt, the crab legs are quite tasty there). I remember my sister saying that our mom saying likes Krazy Buffet better (it's not quite the same buffet, but ok). Even so, she always has her plate piled way high.   Service was very good- it's a team, here. Greetings once inside and upon exiting as well. Everything was clean and in order. Clean plates were replenished for the busy lunch time crowd. Dirty plates were promptly picked up, too. There is a \"wasted food\"  charge, too; well, signs are posted, anyway. FYI, gift cards are sold here.    I would go here again. Next time, I will focus one plate entirely on the sushi station.",

    "text": "Whenever we drop by Sin City. We always eat here. Best price in town for buffet. Decent seafood. They had two locations. We actually started to going the one at the outlets, but that closed down because their 10 year lease was up. So thats when we started going to this location on Decatur.  Same food. Same friendly staff. Truth be told there are a lot of choices in Vegas when it comes to buffet.  However almost all of them are in the range of $$$. Honestly I don't need to be spending $40 - $60 a person for a buffet. It's just not justified to pay that much. For first tourists wanting to be \"wowed\" they'll pay that ridiculous prices. As for myself. Who goes here about 10 times a year, I'm practically a local, no way! Anyhow here's the low down on Makino LV:  Location is superb. (Especially if you're staying in The Orleans, Gold Coast, Rio, & Palms Casino, literally a 2min drive with no traffic!)  Regular Lunch $17 Holiday Lunch $20 (Includes all major Holidays) Regular Dinner $20 Holiday Dinner $24 (Inlcudes all major Holidays)  Their sushi & sashimi are excellent. Of course its not a trafitional Japanese sushi joint per se, but for the price, you get a decent amount of sushi & sashimi heaven. I personally always get their Tuna, & Salmon sashimi, as well from their wide selection of rolls.  Cold section they have (not a complete list) -Various selection of cold sashimi concoctions example: Regular salad, Sashimi salad etc  Hot section they almost always have the following: -FRIED RICE (with eggs) not bad. not too oily. very sou saucy. -FRIED NOODLES (it's not Chow Mein) Before it used to be bery salty. But as of our last few visits, it's been improved. Not too salty and prettt darn good. -KOREAN BBQ I'm not a fan of it. I know my KBBQ, it doesn't taste quite like it. Plus the beef I find to be dry at times because of the heat lamps. Again not a fan. -FRIED CALAMARI Again not a fan. It's ok. Comes with its own sauce.  -BAKED SALMON It's actually pretty darn good. It's just that it's overshadowed by the Salmon sashimi, otherwise I'd be all over this. -BAKED MUSSELS This is one of my favorite. Really good & tasty. -SHRIMP & VEGETABLE TEMPURA It's really nice that they have the shrimp & the vegetable tempuras separated. Because we all know everyone always goes for the shrimp because it's delicious with the tempura sauce especially. Just be careful because the batter on the tempura coating will fill you up rather quickly! -BEEF SUKIYAKI Oh my oh my.......My absolute favorite here! It's heaven on a bowl. Honestly, it's good! Beef is absolutely tender. Same for the tofu. Melt in your mouth goodness! The sauce also is really good. It's a meal by itself. Highly recommened it!  SOUP SECTION: MISO SOUP (never tried this) but they have them premade with the chunks already in bowls.  All you have to do is choose a bowl you want & then place it on their MISO Soup machine that spits out the soup unto your bowl, with the chunks already in it.  RAMEN SECTION: The reason why I never tried their Miso Soup. You have a choice of either Shoyu or Tonkotsu Soup base. Hot, Mild, or Non-Spicy. You can choose to have more or less of everything off the ramen contents. I personally always get Tonkotsu, Non Spicy, extra noodles, extra fried onions.....oh and the sauce is fantastic, esecially if you had been drinking the previous night and wanted to re- hydrate your system. It's oh so nourishing!  DESSERT SECTION: They have multitudes of different cakes & cookies. Fruits also. They also have a Chocolate Fondue Fountain. Honestly what kicks ass is their ICE CREAM! They a various flavors but the only thing that really matters to me is their GREEN TEA, CHOCOLATE, and oh boy it's a perfect ending!  The staff here are all Japanese women (mostly) Their all cute, very slim especially with their all black uniforms they wear. Their also full of energy & perk. Make sure to leave a good tip, they work very hard. Always a great time here.  So in conclusion, if you find yourself in Sin City, & wanted to have a decent buffet for a decent price.  Go no further than Makino on decatur.",

Upon walking in the place was unexpectedly crowded, the decore was much like an older Vegas buffet but the tables are so close together you will bump elbows with your neighbor. Once we sat down they asked us if we would like something to drink. Unfortunately the drinks (soda beverages) are not included with the price. The real bummer here was that you can't change drink types i.e. You can't switch from Sprite to Coca-Cola without being charged and the server brings you the drink. Aside from those comments, the reason for removing another star is due to the fried rice having egg shells in it, and not just a few pieces. I did however enjoy the large selection of sushi, warm entries and dessert. For $30 a person and the quality you get out of it I'm not sure I would race back any time soon.",

Makino is located on a typical town center you see anywhere, doesn't look too standout-ish, so you would've never guessed how good this place was.   Once I walked in Makino, the staff made me feel at ease and were very welcoming. Walking up to the buffet was like heaven. And you wonder, 'Wow, all this sushi for only $25?!'; they had EVERYTHING: spicy tuna, eel rolls, california, etc. So many a la carte ones as well! My only problem with the sushi is that the rice isn't kept tight. If I poked lightly at a roll, the rice will fall apart easily.  They even have a chocolate fountain (thank God, someone has finally answered my prayers!) and a miso soup machine. Pretty awesome! Except the guy behind the dessert counter who refused to answer my question if there were any strawberries.",

The price is a bit higher for dinner at $26.95 a person but it's a good price for what you get.  Also, they have crab legs too but cold. If you want they can heat them for you, just ask someone behind the counter.  Thanks.",

Service was very good and most of the selection was also very good.  However, there were certain sushi dishes that were bland and the rice on others were not as moist as preferred.  Others such as octopus, shrimp, crab, and salad dishes were very good.   Suggest you call for start time and their senior rate to confirm.",

Many of the cooked foods are good too, but I normally eat rolls and sushi. The dessert is also good. They serve ice cream, crepes, etc. They have a chocolate fountain too which I thought was pretty cool. Can't comment too much on the service since it is a buffet, but overall it's a good place to come if you're nearby. Not one of the best seafood buffets you'll probably find though.",

Don't expect to see sashimi. They want you to eat the sushi and fill up on the rice! There's a bevy of choices though and you'll also have a chance to fill up on tempura, 3 kinds of salad and some hot dishes too.  The only thing lacking I felt was the desserts. There's a chocolate fountain which is kinda cool but the presentation of the fruits and marshmellows was mediocre. I know they're keeping costs down by just offering bananas to dip, but. there should be more variety of things to dip into the chocolate.",

Theyre miso is interesting and fresh because they put cabbage in it as well as the seaweed and tofu.

But, then again, if this is among the best that Las Vegas has to offer - then it's best not to eat sushi and instead go to a seafood buffet elsewhere.    Maybe it's the recession but the cost was comparable to other buffets just on the Strip but the quality was much worse so the drive and the cost is soooooo not worth it.",

The selections are many, even for desserts like chocolate fondue, ice creams, shave ice, ect.  They are plenty of rolls and sushi to choose.  There are also pretty good selections of cooked stuffs if you're don't want to eat too much of the 'raw' stuffs.  The only thing not available during lunch that my son love is the salmon roe(eggs).   Todai doesn't have that for lunch either.   I can't really comment much on the cooked stuffs since I normally ignored most of them.  I do love the tempura shrimps though.",

The place was crowded with seating close together, so at times it was difficult to walk between tables, which you have to do to access the buffet. Service was good (drinks were refilled often, dirty dishes cleared frequently, etc...). The food was nothing to write home about.  The hot food was not hot enough, the tempura was soggy, and the sushi rolls did not taste fresh. The pieces of sushi seemed fresh because that seemed to be what was being consumed and therefore turned over quickly. When I got the bill, I noticed the drink was an extra charge, which surprised me because buffets in town include a beverage in the price of the meal. I did not try the desserts, but the green tea ice cream looked good.",

After a long drive out to Grand Canyon and back.  We made it to Makino's quite late.  We got there by 8:50pm.  We did call ahead of time and they indicated they closed at 9:30pm.  So we figured,  Ok we can eat till 9:30, which gives us about 40 minutes.  WRONG.    We got out table started eating.  at 9:10pm, they started removing everything.. and i mean everything.  I was thinking, WTF???? They're business hour sign says close at 9:30pm.. which means, customer's can actually come in up to 9:30pm, right?    After our second plate, that was it.. other than a few left over plates they were wanting the remaining customer's to clean out.  They litterally started cleaning everything out, while there were still a lot of customer's still eating.  I would say about 10~12 table of customers still eating.  By 9:20pm, almost all the food was gone (as in the worker's cleaned it out), and even the desserts were all stacked up on a cart.. My buddy and i almost felt as we were burdening them to ask for a scoop of ice cream for dessert.    This is ridiculous... I dont know if the owner's are aware of this practice? But i think if you're charging your customers the full dinner prices of $26.00 or so.. despite the fact the workers may want to hurry up and go home.. or maybe try and catch the late poker tournament... but if you're business hours says close at 9:30pm..  and you have customer's eating, getting rid of all the food and pretty much pressuring your customers to hurry up and eat and leave by 9:30pm.. is very poor business practice.  They should've at least advice us at 8:50pm, that all the foods will be removed for closing by 9:10pm.. Rather than just charging us the full price, and then pretty much rushing us out of there.  In a city where there's full of buffets, good restuarants.. I have to admit, the food was not bad.  Todai quality... or maybe a tad bit better.. but very bad business practice.  So if you're planning to hit Makino's somewhat late.. dont forget to immediately get about 3 plates full of stuff you want...",

The sushi is fresh and the selections was huge. The prime rib was perfect with the horseradish and the sauce. The variety was just awesome and anyone would be sure to be satisfied.

Everything looked REAL FRESH, salads were good - MISO was excellent!!! Most of these buffet style places have cheapo desserts - NOT HERE - Real Creme Brulet, the green tea ice cream was excellent! They had other stuff I didn't try (too full). You WILL find a couple desserts you will like. Veggie rolls were very good and the wasabi was HOTT!!! Wife thought her meal would cost about $100 at a good sushi place - VERY PLEASED!!! Can't give it a five star because I'm not a sushi, pork, shellfish eater. Hot green tea was also excellent (and I know green tea - this was close to my personal favorite \"Novus Dragon Well Green\") This place is saved in our GPS for the next trip to Vegas!!!",
