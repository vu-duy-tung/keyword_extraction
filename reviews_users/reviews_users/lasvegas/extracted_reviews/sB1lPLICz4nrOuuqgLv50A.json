There was a problem with our crab cakes and the manager said he would take them off but she still charged us for them.",

That is a super great value if you think about the fact that a regular filet costs around $48 a la carte.  If you are going to order dessert, you cannot leave without getting the lava cake and the creme brulee! I actually eat only have of my filet to make sure I have room for dessert. It is simply the best! If I didn't care about my figure, I would eat it all the time.",

I found Morton's here to be a tad better. Service was prompt and everything. They made special menus for my friend's bachelorette dinner with her name on it but had the date completely wrong. It was July but the menu said April (haha) They quickly reprinted new ones with the right month.  I admit, I had low expectations walking in. There are a plethora of exceptional steakhouses in Vegas, the strip is just chock full of them. However, Morton's was do-able.  I always order medium rare. Like I said, anything done over that is just carnivorous sin. I think Morton's and I need a  steak cooking 101 because some sort of lost in translation thing is going on.   My definition of medium rare is a warm red center. What happens at Morton's?   It comes pink.   This happens at the San Francisco location as well.  *sigh*  I would have sent it back if I weren't starving from being on a liquid diet.   Don't get me wrong!! I don't mean I was actually ON a liquid diet. I meant the Vegas diet. You know, booze.  Anyway.",

Trust me, we know what a good steak is and all of the competition has nothing on Morton's.    We started dinner with a small batch cucumber gin on the rocks and a very dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. We both had the Lobster Bisque. As always, it was absolutely delicious. My wife had the Morton's Ribeye (Medium) and I had the Cajun Ribeye (Rare). I tell them to grill mine as it runs past. That's how I like my steak. Anyhow, both super tender, juicy and delicious as usual. We also had the delicious heirloom carrots as a side.    The reason why I love Morton's versus other steakhouses is the consistency. They are spot on every time, unlike all of the hit and miss competition.    I honesty do not give 5 starts to anyone, but Morton's truly deserves it.    I'd also like to say Thank you to our waiter Charles. Not only did he recommend my fantastic drink, his service was impeccable.",

    "text": "2012 Fall Restaurant Week Dinner #1  It's on the corner of E Flamingo & Paradise. I've never dined at a Morton's. I took Restaurant Week as the perfect opportunity to try these \"never been\" places. Not that I need a good reason to eat out... ;)  $50.12/person. Three courses.  What did we order?  1st Course Baked Onion Soup Chopped House Salad  2nd Course 6oz Double Cut Prime Pork Chop 8oz Filet Mignon ($5 upcharge)  Accompaniments Horse Radish Mashed Potatoes Grilled Jumbo Asparagus  3rd Course Creme Brulee Chocolate Mousse  My boyfriend didn't care for the soup, but I thought it was quite tasty. The chopped salad wasn't made well, the bleu cheese was in big chunks, so some bites you got none, other bites you got a big glob. Don't get me wrong, I love bleu cheese. It should be sprinkled on salad, right?!  It was the first time I had horseradish mashed potatoes. It was good, but I think my tongue was waiting for garlic, which I used to. My boyfriend brought home the leftover, so there you go. Worth eating again. Lol..  I'm happy to say the stars of the meal were the meats, as it should be at a place like Morton's. Both medium-rare, they were cooked to perfection and oh so tender. Slightly seasoned to give that great crust on the outside. Yum! They offered a Bearnaise sauce with the filet mignon, but as a steak should be, it was delicious just as is. I enjoy ordering pork chops, I learned that only great steakhouses make it right, since pork is so prone to becoming dry if not cooked correctly. Morton's pork chop was very good.  We both enjoyed the desserts. The creme brulee had the perfect caramelized crunchy sweet top you love to crack open. The chocolate mousse was unusually thicker than most mousses, but my boyfriend devoured it still.   It was a good dinner. Attentive service. It's been a while since I ate at a steakhouse where a maitre d lead you to your table. Want to give 4 stars but something is stopping me. Maybe I've been a bit spoiled dining at such great steakhouses here in Vegas, Prime, SW, etc.  I'll try to be a Morton's fan next time around...",

The Hostess, Management treated us very special.    When the server approached us, he didn't give us his name. He asked us for our drinks then disappeared. When he took our order I felt like we were at in a sit down deli vs. a high class restaurant. He served us our salads but did not ask us if we wanted fresh ground pepper & when he cleared our plates away he got a little irritated the moment I moved my glass. He sometimes gave us funny looks whenever we made a minimal request. Seriously?   Being a former fine dining server myself I know what I could & could not do.   The ambiance, food & wine were exceptional but I will be very choosy on who will be serving us next time.",

I like the fact this particular restaurant is just off the strip. We have never had trouble getting in, even without reservations.  As a Vegas local, I have probably been there 4-5x in the past year mostly special occasions like birthdays, family celebrations, valentines day, etc. A few times we went to other restaurants but had issues that caused us to change our minds upon arrival such as table issues, customer service, etc. When in doubt or in a jam we always go back to Mortons.   The staff is very friendly and shows real quality customer service. It is a very classy romantic feel in the restaurant. Everytime I have been there I have felt important and welcome. I love the fact they even take a picture at your table for you, and give it to you to preserve the memory.  Its a nice personalized touch.   It is hard to find something bad on the menu. The oysters are great, the seafood ocean sampler platter is off the hook a mix of scallops wrapped in bacon, oysters rockefeller, stuffed shrimp and crab cakes.  The Bone in Rib Eye cooked medium is still one of the best steaks I have ever had. Any dish with the shrimp/pasta is great also.    No doubt I will be back in the future.",

The steaks are fantastic, the service is excellent, the atmosphere is darker than what I'm used to. This place is a little off the beaten path (one or two blocks removed from the strip), so I imagine that most of their business is from regulars or people that know the name (or for people who inquire about an upscale steakhouse.) I think that a group of fraternity members, visiting from out of town, are more likely to go to Cabo Wabo than to stumble upon this place and go inside. In any event, I would consider this place as a fine-dining restaurant. One menu Item that I would highly recommend is their \"molten chocolate cake\". You have to order them in advance, so don't forget.",

Upon entering in a wheel chair only one door was held open by the valet attendant, leaving the second door non accessible until another guest opened it! Both walking in and out only one door was opened, making it impossible to get in or out if disabled. The service was mediocre at best! Our orders were all messed up and we got our coffee at least 10 minutes after dessert was served. We all commented it must've been our server's first day as she was extremely disorganized and frantic. Not what you expect at s Morton's. Then to top it off, when we left the hostess and a manager stood at the desk, watching my father (in a wheel chair) wait at the door for someone to open it. They were too busy laughing at him to open it! I stood there, as my heart raced, listening to these arrogant SOB's. The next day I called the manager and instead of listening to me, he defended his employees saying I was lying.  There's a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, Please DO NOT patronize one where discrimination is defended!!!",

Parmesan truffle fries !! Omg !! Little crispy shoestring potato delights !! Homemade potato chips ,with as my friend said , the really good bleu cheese dipping sauce !! Yum!! Everything prepared fresh and using quality ingredients ,this is a great place to start off your mid week shenanigans , as the late power hour is from 9 to close !  Rich and Mike( mark?) the bartenders are some of the friendliest in town and both make what is probably one of the best mojitos in town !! They have a great selection of power hour drinks to satisfy almost anyone's palette , as well as some great wines by the glass and of course the aforementioned mojito , definitely try them out , and if not heading out for more drinks somewhere else , try some dessert more pricey than their power hour specials , but delicious in their own right !!    As for the vibe it's a little old school Vegas , dim and dark , with candle lit tables , an upscale vibe but Definitely not stuffy !! ( although to dine in the restaurant , no tank tops , actually saw this happen where the host offered a guest a jacket to use while dining !!)",

One of our steaks was supposed to be butterflied but when it came out it wasn't. The steaks had a lot of liquid surrounding it and wasn't seared well.

    "text": "Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!.   I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.  Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large \"Onion Loaf\" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the \"Chopped Salad\" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past.   You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the \"Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes\" and \"Lyonnaise Potatoes\" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.  So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the \"Key Lime Pie\" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing \"lime\" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me.   I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)",

    "text": "Morton's Steakhouse never disappoints. My husband and I frequent Morton's for various special occasion and when we just crave a melt-in-your-mouth steak. My husband likes his steaks well done so, as you can imagine, at other steakhouses they flat-iron it, butter-fly it or just cook it until it's a tough briquette. Morton's, on the other hand, always prepares his perfectly- tender but well done. The staff is always welcoming, knowledgeable and very attentive. The atmosphere is dressy casual with an old school elegance and charm. And don't be fooled~ although it's a steakhouse they have a wide variety of menu options including plenty of seafood, extensive wine & drink list as well as some very decadent desserts.",

    "text": "We went here for the first night of Restaurant Week.  The $50 prix fixe menu helped take the sting out of Morton's high prices.  I had some of my favorite dishes off that menu - lobster bisque, filet, au gratin potatoes, and key lime pie.  Those items would have cost about $100 off the regular menu, so the Restaurant Week menu was a very good deal.  But somehow these dishes just didn't \"pop.\"  There was nothing particularly wrong with them, but there was nothing spectacular either.  I will say that I have rarely seen a restaurant that tries so hard to satisfy its customers.  The wait staff and the manager were very attentive.  The service was good (at least until the end of the meal when the big crowds arrived and slowed things down).  But it still comes down to this - there are lots of high end steak houses in Las Vegas with better food and lower prices.  We have a list of our favorites, and Morton's is not going on that list.",

    "text": "Another restaurant where the \"Bean counters\" have taken over and reduced everything to the smallest (higher profit) that they could do. After have a 16 inch square stainless steel plater of multiple cold ocean products at \"The Tavern on the Green\" in NYC at $55 dollars I expected something like that at Mortons. What I got was a plate with 1 bib of lettuce and shaved ice with 1 (one) oyster, a 2 inch piece of lobster, 2 @ 1 inch pieces of some white fish and a small piece of crab meat. It took me all of 30 seconds to eat them. What a rip off. We are used to getting Escargot on a special plate with openings for 8 - 10 escargot. What my wife go was a plate with 4 count em (four) escargot. Another rip off. My 24oz Porterhouse was cooked a little beyond medium rare and did have too much in ligaments and muscle. The potato came with whipped  ?butter? or it may have been margarine. My $12 baked potato was not cooked on one side and was hard to the bite. My wife ordered a Caesar Salad and had to ask for anchovies, she got 2 count em (two) anchovies. At exactly $300 with the tip I could have had a better dinner at the \"Top of the World\" or as my wife did a few weeks ago at Ruth Chris's in Harrows Casino with a Prix Fix menu of $49. If you haven't eaten at restaurants like the \"21 Club\" in NYC you don't have the experience to know how bad this dinner was.",

    "text": "I thought Morton's would be similar to a Fleming's, come to find out, they are what Mc Donald's is to In-N -Out. Came in for an early dinner before a show and we were hungry because we had been on the road all day. With limited time, we decided to get the 3-course steak dinner for $63. The steak was not properly seared or seasoned and the juices ran out all over the cold plate. The filet itself was bland city. Out of the sides we chose the 1)creamed spinach (usually a favorite) which was watery, bland and cold and 2) the au gratin potatoes which were tasty and hot, but not gourmet tasting. The Morton's salad was visually bland but fine. Could they spare a tomato to brighten up the plate? The creme brulee was runny, like it had not set and could have benefitted from a little topping of whipped cream. Key lime pie was good but not as good as say Tommy Bahama. The service was mediocre at best, for example, when I ordered the lesser expensive sparkling wine, the server called my selection the \"cheaper version\" so that probably is telling about the quality of service we received. Anyways, I wasn't trying to be cheap, I just wanted to try something I hadn't had before. I did order the $27 dollar Moet split as my second drink which was far superior. Of course, we always tip 20% regardless of food or service because it's hard to make a living as a server without tips. Nevertheless, I won't be back and regret not going to Stack where we had a similarly priced, excellent dinner last year. For two, we spent a total of $240 with tip so the only thing cheap was the food quality. There are vast better choices.",

Sides would of been great to have with our meal but nothing was necessary considering how full we all were. my friend and her husband ahared a salad and a bake potato i did like how they separated the potato for the both to share and also the salad was served individual to share together on there own plates. i enjoyed that.

Our waiter, Martin, was superb in explaining the menu! Everything sounded so yummy and it was hard to make a decision. So we went with every recommendation that Martin gave us!   To start John ended up ordering the Sliced beefsteak tomato salad with blue cheese dressing. He shared one bit of that with me, which made my Caesar Salad seem less tasty and refreshing! It was the perfect combination of salad/dressing/awesomeness!!   For dinner John got a Cajun marinated rib eye steak - if your mouth isn't watering now, it should be! It was the perfect blend of spices! Yup, he shared that with me too!   I ordered the petite filet which was oh-so-tender! The knife went through each of our cuts like warm butter! To end our meal, the staff took a picture of us and comp'd our Legendary Morton's Hot Chocolate Cake! Order this ahead of time because it takes about 15 minutes to prepare! Well worth it though!!! It was topped with Powdered Sugar, Raspberries, and served with a side of Breyer's Vanilla Ice Cream.   This was the absolute best meal I have ever had in my life!

    "text": "First off, I need to express that this place had some of the best service ever and this 1 star is for the food alone (as well as the prices [even if it was gifted, if I had to pay I would cry] - yikes). I believe that a restaurant has to have good food and good service for me to be a repeat customer and this place is a big DO NOT WANT for me as far as the food goes.   Went here last night with a big party for my boyfriend's cousin's graduation. I noticed quickly that only the sides were vegetarian (obviously, this is a steak house) but after talking to the waiter he said that they could make a vegetable plate for me. I had high hopes since the last time this happened at Todd's who also lacked vegetarian entrees, and the food was spectacular. I also thought that since this place was as pricey as it was, anything I put in my mouth would be orgasmic. Unfortunately every single thing was bland as all get-out.   First off, I tried the bread which looked great but they do not provide proper bread knives so the big fluffy bread ended up being smushed. It was also ridiculously flaky making a big mess and just didn't taste that great.   My vegetable plate came and that's exactly what it was. It was literally giant vegetables just steamed - no herbs, no flavor, no spices - nothing. Totally disappointing. There was broccoli, a halved tomato, asparagus, cooked spinach, and portobello mushrooms which was the best part as those kind of mushrooms pack a lot of flavor by themselves. It was a huge plate but there was no punch.   I tried some of the sides, the panko-encrusted onion rings and the mashed potatoes. Both were also almost flavorless but still kind of decent, but no way were they worth $10 each. Absolutely ridiculous pricing for something so very plain.   The boyfriend and I shared a chocolate souffle for dessert which looked great but was kind of disgusting. It was a hot chocolate sludgy mess. The best part was the cream on the side. Not something I would order again.   I was very disappointed with this restaurant. The absolutely impeccable service however could not make up for the awful food. The meat eaters at the table seemed happy with what they received but I was just in awe at how bland everything was.   Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Pricing: 1/5 (just... yikes.. when my boyfriend said it was $43 for his itty bitty filet mignon I almost choked) Food: 0/5   I really, really wanted to give this place a chance but if you're a vegetarian who has taste buds, stay far, far away.",

My wife and I made reservations for date night (we are locals) and we set the reservation for an earlier time (6:30) to beat the rush. when we arrived we looked for a parking space and all of them were blocked off for valet parking. We then proceeded to the back parking and again blocked off except for 40 or so spaces which were filled by what i would say was the staff. We had to park next door in the strip mall because I do not trust the valet to drive my truck, we then had to scale a 3 foot wall to get to the front door. We  went inside and were seated promptly as there was only a few customers inside. Once I saw the amount of staff standing around watching us be seated I understood the parking situation, I counted at least 17 waiters not to mention the support staff and kitchen help. Now for the service, the waiter was prompt but understanding his accent was difficult. We ordered our meal and asked for water to drink. The waiter then placed our order and came back to us and asked if we were Mormon I explained to him we don't drink and drive and we were not Mormon just responsible. Our meal came and it was mediocre the steaks were good but not $50 plus good per steak. When all said and done the meal was almost $200.00 and the best part of the meal was the asparagus and the chocolate cake. Sorry Morton's  a steak should have a little flavor.",

    "text": "For an amuse-bouche of fine dining, and an excellent prime, dry aged steak, Mortons is a great place to go. I like the \"Frank Sinatra\" atmosphere, with the double entrance that whisks you from a mall into a private, masculine setting with dark woods, quiet music, attentive service, and views into the kitchen.  I've had most of their steaks, the best being the double porterhouse carved tableside, ordered by my wife for my birthday. Yum! I have also had on occasion the filet, new york strip, and ribeye both regular and 'blackened' (regular is better, the steak has plenty of flavor on its own). I'm least impressed by the weekend-only Prime Rib (which was huge, 22+ ounces and requires reservation).  The sides always fresh and huge (read: sharable), and you don't need appetizers given entree portion sizes,but we have had shrimp Alexander which my wife is in love with, and the wedge salad is about half of a head of iceberg.  Do save room for the renowned molten chocolate cake a la mode, even if it means packing up some of your steak - just make sure you reheat your leftovers properly, in a broiler not the microwave!!  We have enjoyed Morton's in Arizona and Pennsylvania, and always experience the same level of service and quality ingredients. I will say that the competition is fiercer in Las Vegas, though.",

If you have ever had a souffle at any time in your life, DO NOT EAT ONE AT MORTON'S!!!  Seriously, what they served up was more like...oh, I don't know...crap.  It wasn't at all the decadent, rich and orgasmic experience you can get at Cut, Fleur de Lys or a ton of other eateries in Vegas.  It was more like a meringue with some sugar dusted on.  FAIL!  Other than that, our meal was decent.  I had the bone-in rib eye, which was juicy, but looked as if it was cooked at too low a temperature.  It had no char and was over-cooked (I ordered medium rare, but it came out about medium).  Where's the blood?!?  Seriously, if I want an overcooked $50 piece of meat, I'll do it myself.  The service did redeem the place, however.  We were not left for want by the waitstaff, and everything was nicely paced.  Even after sitting at our table for 4 hours, they were still very attentive and polite.",

The servers weren't into it, and their presentation was blase. They were also uninterested in refilling my Diet Cokes.  The Vegas economy is down, and even though it was a Saturday night, the place was almost empty. Thus, it's easy to understand why the servers were low energy. It must suck showing up for work knowing that you'll only have a few tables to get tips on.  Then again, I waited tables for two years. On slow nights, I hustled to squeeze an extra few percent out of my table. I left 15% on Saturday, although usually I leave 20-25%.  When the economy is down, you need more hustle - not less.

    "text": "Morton's Steakhouse featured a $99 \"Steak and Seafood\" special, so the Big F and I took advantage of this offer for what we hoped would be a fine dining experience.  The restaurant wasn't particularly overly busy this past Friday as we were seated at our table.  The waiter inquired about our beverage choices before telling us about the menu.  He soon returned with a cart that held examples of the cuts of beef available, the vegetables that accompanied it, and other various dining choices.  It can be a bit overwhelming as he goes over what the restaurant offers, but not to worry since it's all on the menu anyway.  They start you off with a large loaf of bread, and it doesn't matter if you're dining by yourself or with a group, you still get this loaf of onion bread.  (I did ask what they did with the leftover loaf, hoping that they might donate it or something.  No luck.  Into the trash it goes!)  For salads, we both chose the \"Morton's Salad with Morton's Blue Cheese Dressing, Chopped Egg, and Anchovies.\"  It's a combination of romaine and iceberg lettuce leaves.  It would help if they cut the leaves down a bit because it was a mess to eat.  The dressing was alright, nothing special about it being their own blue cheese dressing.  The anchovies added the perfect saltiness, but I'm sure the anchovies were not their own.  With our special dinner of a single cut of filet mignon comes a choice of an appetizer.  I went for the \"Broiled Sea Scallops Wrapped in Bacon with Apricot Chutney.\"  The Big F had the \"Jumbo Lump Crab Cake with Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce.\"  My scallops were good, and what isn't good with bacon?  The sweetness of the chutney added a nice contrast as well.  The crab cake was pretty good too, made with lots of crab and less filler.  They could do a lot better though with the presentation of our meal.  The Big F's plate looked like something was missing!    However, the real problem we both had was with the beef.  Although it was perfectly cooked to how we ordered it (rare), it was ultimately tasteless.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I had my share of filet mignons and I'm used to a smooth taste where the meat melts in your mouth and has you feeling like heaven landed in your mouth.  This wasn't the case here.  It wasn't just my opinion about this tasteless beef, the Big F was on the same page as well.  We ultimately had to ask for Worchestire sauce to douse it so it had some flavor.  (It does come with a side of Bearnaise Sauce, but I've had much better.)  Perhaps we should have said something to the staff about our entrees, and yes, that was our mistake.  It was my first time dining at Morton's and I figure this is how they do their filets. (The Big F usually gets their Cajun Ribeye Steak when he's there, so he had no previous experience with their filet mignons either.)  Our choice side dishes were the \"Macaroni & Cheese with a Hint of Spice\" and \"Lyonnaise Potatoes.\"  The mac & cheese was alright.  I prefer it to have a smoother and creamier texture, but this had that graininess in it.  The Big F did like their choice of pasta for it though.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, cooked with lots of onions.  For dessert, the choices were either Chocolate Cake or Key Lime Pie.  Well, I wish I knew it was actually called \"Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake\" because it was really good.  It had a molten center that was oozed out so nicely when I cut into it.  It was probably the saving grace of the meal.  But because I had finished my tasteless piece of meat, I was too stuffed to finish my dessert and ice cream.  (In retrospect, I would have brought the meat home and recooked it instead.)  The Big F's Key Lime Pie was good too, not as good as the Chocolate Molten Cake though.  We probably would have finished that as well if we had put the meat to the side.  Service was good at some points.  Our beverage glasses were never empty due to the water boys constantly refilling our glasses.  Our waiter checked on us once during our meal, and that's when we asked for the Worchestire sauce.  But I don't recall him coming around much after that.  Overall, my meal at Morton's Steakhouse was disappointing.  Perhaps my taste preferences just don't align with how Morton's does their filet mignons here.  They have raving reviews, so maybe it's just my bad luck that I got a tasteless piece of beef.  Anyway, I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon though.  They do have a happy hour and reverse happy hour.  It was advertised in the restrooms!  (Pics of our dinner are posted!)",

The hostess who picked up when we called gave us horrible directions coming from The Mirage, which took us over an hour (in Las Vegas traffic) to get there, and we were rushed for dinner because we had a show to catch very soon after. Upon arrival, the employee (quite possibly a manager) who was at the front greeted us and asked how we were doing, to which my sister's boyfriend responded \"not good at all\" given that we were lost for an hour (even worse for my sister, who was the one driving!)  He apologized, and we thought that was the end of that. But they ended up giving us free drinks for the whole table (about a $50 value). Not only that, the food was amazing (we had the steak and seafood special), and came out quickly which helped us catch our show. Our waiter was great, and my menu was personalized (because it was my birthday) and framed a picture they took of us and it said Happy Birthday so that really made my night.  Overall, it was a good experience, and I'm definitely down to go back to any other Morton's.",

    "text": "I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one. I'm just going to straight up say it...NEVER come to this Mortons!   Honestly, I've been to other Mortons (mostly the Orange County one) but I have never been satisfied. The only reason why my family and I went to Mortons again is because we had a gift card we wanted to use up. I am extremely disappointed with my visit here!   We started off with a few salads. The chop salad and the Caesar salad. Not too bad. It was a little soggy, but not horrible. The nightmare came when they brought out the meat. I ordered the bone in rib-eye cooked medium. It tasted burnt and dry. I mean I'm paying 50 bucks for a rib-eye and it should be cooked better than it was. I felt I needed some sort of sauce and I feel a truly good piece of meat does not need this! Not only was just my meat burnt, but the other 5 people I was with also felt the meat was overcooked and burnt. We were looking at the main chef (they have a huge opening in the kitchen) and I could see the other pieces of meat were just like this. Some he was throwing away because it could not be served. Maybe because it was super busy (there was a wedding reception) that the meat was like this, but its still no excuse!   As for the side dishes, we ordered the sauteed mushrooms, macaroni and cheese, and hash browns. None of these side dishes stood out for me. The mac and cheese was overly cooked and too strong of a flavor. It was pretty bad. The sauteed mushrooms were alright, nothing special and the hash browns were Denny's status. I would go with some other sides besides the ones mentioned above if you must absolutely come here.   Dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and apple pie. You must tell them you want these items when you order because it takes 30 minutes to prepare. The chocolate cake is definitely worthwhile. The warm chocolate inside the cake melts in your mouth and is paired perfectly with vanilla ice cream. The apple pie was pretty great as well, but not as good as the chocolate cake. Fresh and warm! Just how I like it.   I would highly recommend going to another steakhouse such as Ruth Chris, Flemings, or Mastros if you are interested in a steakhouse.",

Definitely a classy looking joint for a good steak. Unfortunetly, we didnt get any steaks, just the seafood platter and many many oysters! The platter for two and just enough crab, the lobster was very juicy, shrimp was meaty, and the oysters were so big and delicious we ordered a dozen more on the side. Couldnt resist!!! It also came with 2 large seared scallops but were chilled. The cajun spice coating was great, but being used to eating hot seared scallops it threw me off a bit. Got the brussel sprouts as a side, served with bacon bits and shallots. What doesnt taste good with bacon and shallots, seriously! Delicious! Potato bread was nice and warm, fluffy, perfect. Best part....dessert!!! They brought a live dessert menu over with all the choices on the platter!! Soooo cool. We chose the creme brulee and cheesecake. The brulee had perfectly flamed sugar crust almost like a layer of candy! The creme was sweetened nicely, and the cheesecake was served plain with strawberrys. I just wish they would have served it with some sort of sauce. With all this, cappucinos, and a round of drinks, the bill came to 140, I was impressed.  All in all great service, sound ambience, and excellent job with the food. I WILL be back, especially for those oysters! Good job Mortons on my first visit",

    "text": "We were among the first of a few tables to arrive on a Friday night. As our meal continued on, the dining room began to fill. Nice old-school atmosphere with Sinatra playing in the background. We were on limited time so we got perturbed waiting for menus. We didn't realize the menus don't come until the end of the presentation. Which adds some kitsch, we know what meat and veggies look like so we would've rather got straight to the point, but I digress.  We ordered a Caesar salad and jumbo shrimp cocktail to start. The Caesar was ordinary; heavy on dressing and the lettuce was limp. The shrimp cocktail was excellent. Additionally, the bread served is warm, flaky, buttery, with a hint of onion and poppy seed - delicious.   Next, for the main course we selected the Chicago-style bone-in ribeye, And the double-cut filet mignon and we opted to share the baked potato and garlic green beans. The seasoning used on the steaks was saltier than we like. We were unimpressed by the bone-in steak, it was among the worst we've had. There was a considerable amount fat to work around and it wasn't nearly as tender or juicy as similar steaks had at Delmonico, STACK, SW. etc. The filet was tender and full flavored. The baked potato was just that and the garlic green beans were a standout.  Overall, the menu offers traditional steakhouse fare, service was excellent throughout the meal, and our total for dinner was $150 before tip. Felt that the meal was overpriced. In the future, I'd rather visit comparatively priced steakhouses in town that offer better quality steaks and/or more creative menus.",

The 5-onion soup was good but not great. It is a french onion style soup but I don't much care for the two burnt croutons they put on top and the cheese was not melted correctly. The grilled asparagus and mashed potato sides were also a perfect choice. The potatoes were buttery and smooth. The balsamic glaze on the asparagus really added a nice flavor overall.  They have a steak and seafood special. Ask about it. You get a petite filet [which you can change for an additional charge] a side, soup or salad, an appetizer and a dessert. It is the same deal offered at \"tix for tonight\"  The key lime pie was really great, too. Not as tart as a key lime pie should be, but still a delicious piece of pie.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Morton's on our recent trip to Vegas.  Being that we were on vacation, we were looking foward to going to a nice, upscale restaurant for a really good meal.  The restaurant was close to where we were staying at the Hard Rock, and the neighborhood seemed safe, so we walked.    The staff was friendly.  The place was not busy, but we sat for awhile after being seated before the waiter brought a menu, and then, it was only a beer and wine menu.  We ordered cocktails.  We don't mind paying for good food and good service, so I expected it to be a bit pricey, but $8.00 for a lite beer was a bit much.  When the waiter poured the beer from the bottle into the glass, it didn't all fit, so he was going to take the last bit away with the bottle.  At that price, we made sure we got it all!   After the drinks came, we had to sit and wait awhile longer before we got food menus.  Next, we ordered salads.  Neither of us eat onions, so our choice was limited, since we were told the salads were premaid with onions.  We ordered the bacon spinach salads because the menu description looked like something we would like, but to our distaste, they came with mushrooms throughout, which we also do not eat, and the bacon we almost undetectable.  We sent them back and did without.  Eventually, the waiter brought us a small loaf of \"onion bread\" that we nibbled on, since we were starving by this time, and the restaurant didn't have another kind of bread to substitute.    Next we ordered our entree's.  My wife ordered the fillet and I got the ribeye.  The $45 fillet was fatty and tough, and the ribeye was worse.  The portion size also seemed smaller than listed on the menu.  There wasn't much choice for side dishes, so we got mashed potatoes \"to share\".  We would've also ordered a vegetable side, but we expected to have the $15 spinach salads that we ended up sending back.  The \"share\" portion of potatoes turned out to be enough for just one person.  With the way the evening was going, we decided to forego dessert.  $200 and 3 hours later, we left Mortorn's dissappointed and still hungry.  I would've been more satisfied with a footlong sub from Subway!  I wouldn't gamble on Morton's in Vegas again.",

The over aggressive waiter told me that what I was ordering was no good and tried to up sell us multiple times, followed up by worst service I've even seen at a fine steakhouse. We left the waiter a 10% tip as a result. As we were pull out of the parking lot he ran out and gave us the sarcastic salute. We went back in and demanded the rest of the tip back, which was returned to us by the manager.",

I've been to los angeles and the beverly hills one but this one is definetely one of the worst in the country.  We have a server who never introduced his name after we were waiting for more than 10 minutes. He then come by and say there was a mix up on whose table he supposed to serve on? What kind of management is that?? Considering that we even have reservation.  It tooks 45 minutes to get some appetisers and then another hour for steak to arrive. Are you really that busy?? Do you know we are paying more than $600 to get that kind of treatment?  Absolutely never come here. He even put the steak at the wrong place!! I ordered medium and get medium rare while my girl ordered a medium rare and get a medium.   How f up can u be if you dont even know how to serve one table?  From my experience, I would never come to this steakhouse anymore, if you are in Las Vegas and u want to pay a satisfying steakhouse, go to Vick and Anthonys in Golden Nugget. Now thats' a steakhouse!!!!",

I have always had the best service at Morton's and often bring guests, family visitors or business associates here. True, the cart with the meat and veggie presentation is \"no more\".   This is a True \"Chicago\" style steak house with fair portion sizes. The sides are served family style. Cant say I am a big fan of the Macaroni and Cheese but it is back on the menu. The bacon topped Brussels sprouts are to die for !!   Some locations have the steaks on display, be warned if you don't like to see meat !  This location displays the wines around the room and in a cooler in the back of the place as well. Our family enjoys sitting near the kitchen area to watch the prep but not near the kitchen doors. My reservation requests for times and booths have always been honored.   Steak is always tasty but I have had a couple of times where it was under-cooked and sent back for more fire. The maitre d'  will arrange Morton's out of town dining if you are travelling. This was done for us for our Las Vegas trip last year 2011 and again this year 2012.   Deserts range from rich chocolate cake, apple pies, ice creams to various berry dishes with heavy Italian desert cream and if you ask at the start of the meal , a hot lava chocolate cake can be prepared.",

Service: good, i felt kind of weird when our waiter comes by every time and when he takes our order or check on us, he blinks continuously.  But overall, service was great.  Food: we order the seafood platter(chilled), ribeye steak, and filet migon.   seafood: everything was super cold, all the seafood portion(lobster, oyster, shrimp, crab meat, scallop)  was a little small for me if Im paying $50. But everything was good except for the oyster. Dont get me wrong the quality was excellent, but i ate one, there was tons of small fragments of their shell on it. I had to spit it out, what a waste of good oyster.  ribeye: EXCELLENT!!!! High end quality and taste was perfect, super big, worth the money.   filet: the gf asked for medium well, we got medium well, i told her to tell the waiter,but she sticked with it. Blood was ozooing out and the meat was super red.   Overall like it. if your looking for a great place to go with ur gf or bf (for you ladies and guys), then this is the place.",

This is my dad's favorite restaurant and they didn't disappoint us even though I wanted to try other to trendy places like Cut or Craft.  Yes, I can be a sucker marketing and ambiance.    Regardless of my bias, our waiter was cool, the food was just as delicious as a Cut, Craft or Boa.  Plus, we had fun and enjoyed leaving with a picture from the night.  The prices are a little high if you have alcohol with dinner, but we had a coupon for free desserts with each entree.  I noticed that they have a great happy hour to offset the dinner prices.  My favorite desserts in order from best to least favorite - key lime pie, hot chocolate cake and carrot cake.  Although the carrot cake was my least favorite, they were all great endings.  Now about the main course - the porterhouse was phenomenal, especially with the sauteed spinach, mushrooms and onions.  It's too bad they no longer have the mac' n cheese.  The sea bass that my dad had was flavorful, but I'm a bigger fan of red meat.  Enjoy.",

The meats are huge, the Salad's are huge, the potato was the size of my two fists side by side! and the dessert was very sharable.  Your bill will be more reasonable if you split the entree.  :)  The bonus on our visit was that waitress was the sweetest, most helpful, kind, and patient wait staff I've EVER dealt with.   Even with all our quirky \"split this\", \"does that have egg in it?\" and \"can we get that on the side?\" questions and requests.  She had a great attitude and a lovely smile on her face throughout our visit.  By the way, the happy hour menu looks pretty fantastic but we weren't in Vegas long enough to go back and try it.  I will definately do that if I go back.",

Everything is about $3-4 more than it should be, and other than dessert, nothing impressed.  The Filet Mignon sandwiches from the appetizer menu (regularly 4/$16) have good quality meat but very little of the mustard-mayo and thus little moisture. Ask for Dijon on the side. The Crabcake BLT sliders ($17?) were a hit though, would get them again if we came back.   The Caesar Salad ($13) is huge, but oddly doesn't come with anchovies unless you specifically ask for them, which we found bizarre. The $15 Baked Five Onion soup was packed with onions, but the broth lacked depth and frankly the portion was worth half the price. Literally every other French onion soup I've had in Vegas (including on the Strip) has been cheaper and better than this one, and usually larger.   But Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake ($15)? It's legit legendary, probably the best lava style cake I've ever had- liquid milk chocolate center, lightly floured exterior with raspberries for presentation, served with a scoop of ice cream. Plating this on a long, flat rectangular platter was an odd choice that made it difficult to eat the ice cream.   The service was okay, but the high prices weren't justified and frankly, blocking off a third of the parking lot for valet when your dining room is mostly empty is a turn off. Maybe they have great steaks, but I don't really care to find out.",

Though the restaurant was busy, we were seated almost immediately! Our waiter, Isaac, was very attentive to our needs, walking us through the menu choices! I chose the mixed grill, very reasonably priced at $59. My nephew chose the ribeye and my brother and sister chose the filet mignon with a shared baked potato! All agreed the food was top quality and the service was impeccable! I give this Morton's my highest marks!",

It should if you are going to be paying $100 per person for dinner.  When it was a classy place you were greeted by  maitre b in a tux and a hostess in a dress. Now you are greeted by a hostess in a pantsuit.  You used to get two waiters to take care of you and they were very friendly. Now you get an ill dressed waiter that is very disinterested. You used to order your food as the course came and you would select your meat from a display cart. Now you have to order all your food all at once from the menu. They used to change the table cloth when you came to the main course and give you a new place setting. Now they don't.  The GM was very kind and took note that we were not enjoying our experience even though we did not make any complaints. The food is still good and if you are not used to dinning in a really up scale place than you would probably think this place is really nice, but if you are looking for a classy place where you feel appreciated for choosing to dine there, I would recommend going somewhere else.",

It was their first time celebrating an anniversary (shakes heads) and we all wanted to really enjoy ourselves.  Reservations aren't really needed, plenty of seating. There is also a private room, too. Anyway, my boyfriend decides to order for everyone. Ahi tuna tower, a dozen oysters, porterhouse steak for 2, sea bass, mashed cauliflower, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. Oh, and two bottles of wine. In addition to cocktails. Booze-filled dinner. Perfect for a 10-odd or so year anniversary dinner.   I was not expecting such delicious oysters from Morton's. Morton's is in Las Vegas, in the middle of the desert for goodness sake but these oysters... Wow. They were very, very clean and we all agreed that was some of the best darn tasting oysters we've ever slurped. Ahi tuna, I've had better. Sea bass, the guys demolished that poor fish in minutes. Porterhouse was perfect for the 4 of us. Cooked medium rare, this chunk of perfectly cooked, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth, piece of ambrosia was worth the $128 tag. The sides were tasty and what made me sad was there were no leftovers to bring back to the hotel. We demolished everything on that table. Except for that second bottle of wine. We had to to-go it.   Our server was phenomenal. An Asian guy with bleached hair. He was so kind and patient with our table, I regret not getting his name to properly address him but thank you for making our night so enjoyable!   The bill was over $500/$600 but it's Morton's. Oh well. Just win it back at the roulette table. Thank you, Morton's!",

The manager said it's the stripe mall behind them that's to blame. Even if that's the case they ought to figure out a way to keep it out of their restaurant.   The one manger that served our wine just doesn't understand customer service.  My wine glass had cork pieces in it and another two had debris in them.  Instead of apologizing and replacing all three glasses he said he'd use a filter.  Well...that didn't work either.  He then handed me the wine list and said choose something else.  No offer to open a new bottles, comp a glass of wine, etc....I wasn't looking for free wine but after several issues the right thing to do would have been to comp a glass a wine or something.   I ended up not even ordering wine with my horrible steak.  Probably one of the worst steaks I've had in a long time.  I couldn't even eat it.  The waitress knew it wasn't good but didn't do anything.  It was clear she was new.  As the check was coming the manager came to our table with two bottles of wine and asked if I'd like to try one.  It was way to late for late. He should have done that as the problems were unfolding.  He should have also notice the 6 oz filet that was left on my plate (ordered 8 oz filet).  Anyway, I could go on and on about how bad my experience was at this location but it's not worth it.  So many better steakhouses in Vegas that will get my business going forward.",

    "text": "I visited Morton's on my anniversary. I had only been there once before several years ago. The atmosphere was terrific even though it was very busy. I was surprised to read some recent unfavorable reviews but I come to my own conclusions. The only odd thing was what the hostess said to me when I came in. I had a reservation for one, told her my name and she asked me if I wanted a table?? Odd, because I don't believe I would make a reservation if I didn't want a table. She said, \"single people usually sit at the bar.\" The girl was probably about 18 yrs. old. Move on. I was seated quickly and my server came by to get my drink order. I had the Morton's Cosmo which was yummy. I ordered the Bibb Lettuce salad which was very good, I ordered the bone-in ribeye and sauteed spinach and mushrooms. My steak was prepared perfectly and the spinach and mushrooms were amazing. I didn't need dessert and there was no way I could have eaten another bite, so I ordered the carrot cake to go. I read a recent review that said the carrot cake was small but I can tell you, that is definitely wrong. My piece has to weigh well over a pound. My experience was marvelous as I expected. I do not understand or agree with the slightly negative reviews. I hope other potential diners do not pay attention to those reviews. Visit Morton's and see for yourself. You will not be disappointed with the food or service. However, your meal will not be cheap but for a special occasion it is oh so worth it! My server, Taylor was very friendly and attentive and when I return at some time in the future, I am certain I will have another fabulous food festival.",

    "text": "AMBIANCE:  Of the four Morton's I have visited, this was probably the best, though Gaslamp Quarter is nice and cozy.  Very modern and very dimly lit.  Probably the nicest bar of the four as well, and if it wasn't for the whole booth-moving crumb-scraping experience I'd consider eating in the bar if I didn't have a reservation.    FOOD: The creme brulee is a safe choice for dessert- the other items are embarrassingly huge. The truffle cauliflower was great, but not at all what we expected: very heavy on the what we think was crusted parmesean cheese, a bit salty, and very pureed. The brussel sprouts side is excellent.  The wife got her steak well-done, and even though that's a culinary no-no, I must say it was still bomb.  At least she didn't ask for ketchup. Though my filet on my first visit was just Ok, my second cut was the usyal perfect, and the must-order mixed grill option adds three fat buttery shrimp and 2 bacon-wrapped scallops for only $5 more.  Do it.  SERVICE: On a late Easter night, we had the place to ourselves, and had the lovely Audrey serve us. Our first visit was on a Christmas, and my wife's medium well steak was reddish pink and a bit cold, so we returned it.  Our awesome server Erica and the manager were so concerned with our great experience that they gave her a new lobster tail (she had eaten half hers), gave us an additional side of truffle cauliflower, and gave us a free dessert.  And even though we never complained (or maybe because we didn't), they comped her meal.  That's above and beyond. That's six stars.  I can't guarantee you'll get comped the way we did, but it's safe to say they clearly cared more about our experience than our money tonight.  Side note: Weird that we ate there on the celebration of Jesus Christ's birth and then his Ressurection. Our next visit will be on his Bar Mitzvah.",

I had the wedge with blue cheese and the petite fillet with Alaskan king crab legs. The steak was prepared as ordered (medium) and was a 5 on a scale of 1-10. The crab was the same. For dessert I chose the crem brulee pie and fresh rasberries. Both of these were fresh and enjoyable.

    "text": "When we arrived at Morton's we were exhausted and we'd had a cruddy week working a convention. To be blunt, we didn't want to be there. Our friends insisted and treated us to dinner. They also ordered things we normally would avoid and force-fed us. Let me tell you, this was a GREAT thing. First off, you MUST have the Tuna Tartare. Yeah yeah - its raw and not your thing? Trust me, it's unbelievable. We tasted a bit just to be polite, then had to order one for ourselves because it's just that good. No fishiness at all, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I think this dish is reason enough to go there. After that we got some steaks and mushrooms, and I think we got every side available to share with the group. After one bite of that dinner, we forgot about our sucky day and had a great time. The server was attentive, classy and amusing. The food was outstanding. No wonder this place has the reputation they do. Don't expect to leave without emptying your wallet, but it's worth it.",

    "text": "On our return to Las Vegas, this time for my wife's participation in the \"Rock & Roll Marathon\", I decided I wanted steak.  I was going to suggest Lawry's across the street from where we were staying, but I discovered my mother in law doesn't eat beef and my wife didn't want to go to McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant (that is where we went to the last time we where in town).  I had heard about Morton's and called them to see if they served anything other than steaks - they do (yay)!  They have valet parking, but we parked ourselves in the back where the parking is shared with other establishments (Bucca di Beppo).  Inside the lighting was a bit low and they had candles at each table.  The girl at the front that greeted us  seemed indecisive, but asked us to wait where another host greeted us warmly and took us to our seats.  At this point didn't have menus, which I thought was a bit odd, but our server showed up with a big tray giving us an idea of the cuts of meat available mentioned on the menu - VERY nice.  It took a lot of guess work out of ordering.   I ordered the Chicago cut which has the bone in the meat and had it cooked medium rare.  I also ordered mash potatoes and the Morton's Salad (both of these with my wife).    My wife had a smaller cut without the bone (8 oz) with asparagus, and crab cakes, cooked medium.    My mother in law ordered the sea bass and had some of my wife's salad (which was half of mine) and some mash potatoes.    After we ordered our server gave us some fresh baked onion bread and some butter.    When our food arrived it was cooked to perfection.    My wife and mother in law enjoyed theirs as well, although my wife seemed to enjoy mine better than hers.  Personally I believe the fact that I choose to have mine cooked medium rare is the reason why, she prefers her's well done.    In summary, Morton's is fantastic.  VERY expensive and I plan to return only if I have a very good reason (i.e. Anniversary).",

    "text": "My fiance and I wanted a nice restaurant venue -- that WASN'T in a casino--for our intimate 50 guest wedding so that we wouldn't have to bother with too many vendors and details and decorating. After looking at plenty of options (and believe me, Vegas has just too many), we wandered into Morton's and wandered out completely sure that Morton's was it. Their event coordinator was on the ball with every question we asked them, from children's menus, to available technological facilities (wireless or wired mic, ipod connection, and projection screen in 2 of their banquet rooms), to how much freedom we have to decorate, what's the party minimum (i believe 20-25 people), menus with price per person, what's included, everything. They even gave us dates that we could visit the facility before other wedding events so that we could see how it is set up. A week later the coordinator called us for some follow up, and we signed a contract with them soon thereafter.  We never regretted it. The entire time they kept good communication with us, sometimes asking us about details that we hadn't thought about. The event coordinators were professional, on the ball, warm, friendly, and personal. They were responsive to even the smallest details that we asked them about, including getting the names and numbers of all our other vendors (cake and florist) just in case things didn't arrive while we were at the ceremony. They also set up our decorations the morning of, just as we asked them to. We couldn't have asked for more.   In keeping with Morton's tradition, the food WAS DELICIOUS, the atmosphere was classy, and the waitstaff very skilled and professional, and they were honest: we paid more than we actually used (the guests didn't drink as much alcohol as we thought they would) and they gave us a check for amount we overpaid the same day. This is a refreshing breath after so many of the wedding horror stories I hear where venues take newlyweds for as much as they can.  Our wedding reception was absolutely lovely. I highly recommend Morton's to anyone looking for a great intimate wedding venue-- or even a nice date night.",

We were staying on the strip and were going to glitter gulch to play some craps. We didi not want a long drwn out dinner or to get too filled up. We ate at the Bar and it was exceptionally good service, the bartender John and Rich were excellent, they were just the best bartenders I have met in a long time, they listened to our long winded stories and were just plain nice.  They shook every patrons hand welcoming them it was no wonder there were so many regulars stopping in before they went to the dining room. and we   We shared a NY strip steak and it was perfectly cooked and perfectly delicious.  The Wedge salad is excellent too, something I would never have had and likely won't ever have anywhere else.  Side were great and we really had a good time.  It is off the strip and a little tricky to get to but not really too bad. Our whole dinner was $124.00 and we had 2 bourbons  one steak, two sides and 2 salads.  We did not have wine with dinner.  Go, enjoy they are consistently good.     I thought as i left, I'll be back if only to catch up with the bartenders John and Rich.",

    "text": "My friend and I had tickets to see Carlos Santana at the Joint and on a whim we decided to have dinner at Morton's.  It was early (7:00pm) so we didn't have a problem getting a table. I am not much for the stuffiness of traditional steakhouses and I made numerous attempts with the server to take the formalities down a notch.  By dessert the server was cutting up with us finally.  But the service was great. My friend and I started off by sharing a Jumbo lump crab cake.  The portion was small, but was perfect for us because we were really saving room for dessert. For salad my friend ordered the Sliced Beefsteak Tomato and the server split it for us which was a nice touch. At this point we had to decide if were were going to have dessert because the hot desserts are baked fresh.  Both of us at this point had chocolate lava cake on the mind, so in the oven it went. For an entree we both ordered the sesame encrusted yellow-fin tuna.  We requested rare and it was served perfectly seared with a soy ginger sauce and wasabi on the side. With the entree we had ordered the Creamed Spinach and Potato Skins, which were hardly touched by either of us because the yellow-fin was such a huge portion.  My guess would be 6 ounces, which is comparable to Morton's steak portions.  I am not a big eater but I finished the yellow-fin because I couldn't bear to leave any of it, it was so good. And there it is. Nice and warm, served fresh from the oven with vanilla Haggen daz on the side, the perfect Lava cake.  We got so lost in the cake that when I gained consciousness and noticed the time it was 2 min before the concert was to start.  Luckily, Mr. Santana never starts on time. I am not a big meat eater and my friend is a pseudo vegetarian (seafood only), so it was ironic to find both of us in a famous steakhouse like Morton, but I have to say I was very please with dinner.",

My fiance took me here for our anniversary and we were treated like royalty. The manager even printed us our own personalized menu for the day. In addition, they have someone who comes around to take your picture, and they put it in a cardholder with a special message. We really felt special.  We took advantage of the steak and lobster special, which was just the right amount of food. You might think 6oz is not big enough for a steak, but honestly with the sides and bread, I was so stuffed I couldn't even finish my food. I was in a serious food coma by the time we left.  The only negative thing are the sauces that they charge you and extra $5 for. It's quite a rip off.  And they come in this giant sauce dish, so you could easily share with 2 people, which our server neglected to tell us and we both ordered the blue cheese butter and could definitely have saved $5.    Other than that, the food was amazing, the service was amazing, and we left feeling very full, satisfied and happy.",

I call the GM number as requested and make reservations. The past two years they have had to scramble last minute to make a custom menu and fancy up the table. Don't know if Daniel passes on this is an anniversary celebration. Anyway, the food is always spectacular and service is better than any other steakhouse. We enjoyed the tomatoes and blue cheese salad to start followed by cajun ribeye for me and small fillet for my wife. We share the matchstick fries. We finished the meal with carrot cake. Execution of the meal was spot on. The only reason I did not give them a 5+ star was I figured out after we left I was charged too much for my dinner and they did not seem to know it was a special occasion dinner. The mistake on the bill was only around 12.00 and something that will not keep us from coming back. In fact, when you take in consideration the comps they gave us, we were ahead. Big props to Assistant GM Mark and to our server Gabriel for outstanding service and their kindness.",

Glad to see they kept it \"old school\".  We ordered the beefsteak tomatoes with blue cheese to start. Very good!  I ordered my usual entree, the petite fillet.  Not as good, as it was seasoned weird and no sear.  Hubby said I should have sent it back, after all it was a $45 piece of meat!  The truffle matchstick fries were awesome!  The carrot cake for dessert was .  Morton's still is one of our favorites!",

    "text": "Well I have read a lot about this place, so to be fair, I more a full flavor kind of guy. That being said, I will give my review.  To begin, the facility was very well maintained and the greeter was great and knowledgable of the situation. It was my anniversary and as we came in they wished us a happy anniversary etc. This was a nice touch for my wife who was happy about the recognition. We were seated promptly and again presented with a menu that stated \"Happy 4th Anniversary\" at the top. Again, my wife was excited by the touch. Our waiter, recommended a few things, but we had studied the menu prior, and we already knew what we wanted. A small annoyance was the waiter telling us everything we ordered was \"the best\" and twenty minutes later, a table next to us was seated. He then used words like \"honestly that is the best\" about other items. I understand he is working hard for tips, but if he focus more of his attention to our needs throughout the meal as opposed to buttering us up, he would get a better tip in my opinion but I digress.  Our first appetizer was the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella which has heirloom tomato in the middle and was covered in a balsamic sauce and sat upon red onion and arugula. This was hands down the best dish of the night.  This is a must have. My wife hates cheese, and she even loved it.   Next was the main course. I ordered the 5 peppercorn strip steak and I must say it was ok. On scale of 1-10, 10 being the best I ever had, I'd give it a 6.5. It was just not salted well and it also sat on a pepper corn sauce. That ironically saved the steak. In my opinion a great steak needs no sauce.  To be continued.....",

    "text": "Probably the most underwhelming of the private group steakhouse dinners that I've been to.  I was invited to attend a dinner at Morton's The Steakhouse with a modified version of the Silver Menu, the lowest cost tier of their private dinner menu (as published on their web site: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mortons.com%2Fprivate_dining%2Fmenus%2FPDR_for_Web_12_16.pdf&s=dadf13097b2a9aa2ce5ea290fa9f6f5235b5571c5fbc8072a63f123c9ed8ad25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mortons.com/private_dini...</a>). The differences included lack of hors d'oeuvres and only one dessert selection. As with my other recent experiences, I did not have any personal expenses for this occasion.  Service was good, as I've come to expect. Plates and utensils were delivered and removed efficiently and unobtrusively. I would've been glad to be informed that only one drink portion would be available, but at least I was able to get out quickly and safely after consuming my delicious Cabernet early on. Pleasant, non-Stumptown-y coffee (their beans are always too acrid for me) at the end also helped, and the server obliged when I changed my mind after they made their rounds.  Atmosphere was better. Music was low. More importantly, the private room was rather well-lit and, for whatever reason, remained that way. That's always a plus whether you're taking photos for Yelp or just trying to see the color of the interior of your steak. Oh, and the restroom was clean and also quiet.  The complimentary bread and butter was actually really nice. The bread was crunchy and fluffy, with onion bits on top, and the butter was light and tastier than usual.  First dish to arrive was the Caesar Salad. It was very simple, with one medium-sized crunchy slice of bread as a crouton and no meat or anything. All the lettuce was fresh and crispy, and the dressing was even and not too heavy, but it was ordinary compared to what I've had at other chain steakhouses.  The main course came next. Of course I ignored the salmon and chicken dishes, choosing the 8 oz. Filet Mignon as any reasonable person (sans dietary concerns) would do in a steakhouse. I had mine cooked medium-rare and decided to say yes when the server asked if I wanted it red in the middle, and the steak came out cooked exactly that way, to my surprise. Unfortunately, the flavor was a little lacking as I've come to expect from most filets, and the beef wasn't even that tender. Definitely the least impressive of my recent steakhouse entrees.  We had two sides. Sauteed Garlic Green Beans, presented on the same plate as the entree, were crunchy but bland. \"Twice Baked\" Au Gratin Potatoes were served family-style and were delicious as cheesy potatoes usually are. I would've definitely cleaned the plate if there weren't so many people at the table.  Dessert was Cheesecake. It was really delicious, and it almost convinced me to up my rating. The cake was sweet but not overly so, and the crust had a surprising crispiness at the bottom. The half-strawberry garnish was a little pale, but made up for lack of redness with ideal sweetness and bursting-ness.  Dinner at Morton's in a private dining format was not bad overall, but I can't be a fan when the steak is mildly disappointing, the star is a sometimes-skippable course, and the other standouts are just supporting cast. I doubt that I'll return except for special deals, such as the $1 filet mignon sliders that I faintly recall trying and not especially loving on \"National Filet Mignon Day\" last year.",

The parking lot is mainly valet, which is complimentary.  If you would rather park yourself, there is plenty of spots on the opposite side of valet.  We had reservations and were kindly seated quickly.     To begin an onion bread loaf is brought for the table.  If you're on a date, I wouldn't eat too much so you don't have onion breath all night.  Married couples - dig in!   I started off with the Caesar Salad.  It's a nice starter size with fresh shaved parmesan.  For my main attraction I chose the Shrimp Alexander.  The plate had 6 good sized pieces which had a light panko coating with a bread stuffing center.  The dish had great seasoning so I had to share!  It was plenty for a filling meal.    With the restaurant week menu, a choice of dessert comes with it.  I opted for the cheesecake.  Now I was expecting a regular NY Cheesecake slice.  I was pleasantly surprised with the caramelized sugar coat on top.  It was almost like they crossed Creme Brulee and Cheesecake.  It's a match made in heaven.    What was off was the service. I think our waiter was having a bad day.  I had to ask him twice for the Restaurant Week menu.  For some reason he didn't seem happy about giving it to me.  The rest of the evening he was short in responses with almost an indifferent attitude.    Aside from the strange service, I enjoyed the meal very much.  I hope to return to a more welcoming environment.",

Seeing the pictures on yelp, we opted to go for the bar bites versus full on dining. The bartender was very nice and very attentive to us, so that was a plus (I forgot his name.. maybe Gabriel?) We ordered the filet mignon trio, parmesan truffle matchstick fries, and the prime cheeseburgers. ALL DELICIOUS! The fries were literally perfect. Most matchstick fries that I've tried from other places are usually all very crunchy... kind of like the crumbs at the bottom of a potato chip bag. However, these were thin, yet still had the right amount of bite that you taste the potato and not just crunchy fried crumbs. Can you tell it was my favorite? The filets were all cooked to a perfect medium rare. My favorite was the filet with the blue cheese sauce, which i've never had until tonight. The manager, Thomas, also gave us a complimentary enormous slice of carrot cake!! Carrot cake is usually a hit or miss for me because it's either too sweet or too bland. Morton's carrot cake is SO GOOD. The frosting had the flavor and texture of a very light cheese cake and it was just the best way to end the dinner. ON TOP OF THAT, Thomas also handed us complimentary bar bites vouchers for our next visit. I can't wait to come back and try the regular dine in menu!!",

We were warned by the concierge where we were staying that Mortons wasn't that good in Las Vegas. Made the dinner reservations any way. As we were walking into the restaraunt a patron was walking out and also warned us of the terrible food. Went in anyway. Stupid, stupid, STUPID! I had the cajun rib steak, lobster mac and cheese, and spinach with mushroom. My wife had the fillet with asparagus. We started the dinner with escargot. My wife said her dinner was very good. The escargot was good as well. Service was good but not great. My dinner? It SUCKED! The rib steak was tough, over cooked with a nasty piece of grissel running through the middle of it. Thank God for the cajun seasonings or it would have been tasteless. The lobster mac and cheese had a cheese sauce that was grainy. The spinach with mushrooms were very good. The highlight of the dinner was that I was sitting across the table with my lovely wife. Next time I'll try Ruth Chris. But dont waste your hard earned money on Mortons Steakhouse in Las Vegas!

I will definitely return...I ordered  crab cakes,bacon wrapped scallops, Brussel sprouts, and horseradish mash potatoes.  Everything was absolutely cooked and seasoned perfectly. I hear the trout is good, which I'll be having when I return. Service was top notch. Atmosphere is great for a date or anniversary spot. It was a treat myself because I'm awesome meal  -wish I had pictures to post, but I was too busy enjoying my meal",

We were running a bit late so did Valet. The place is pretty gloomy and they pull the table out to have you get seated. Our server was amazing and very patient with us since we had no idea what to get. He was very knowledgeable with the menu items. While we looked through the items, the hostess comes around and took a picture of us. We started out with a couple of drinks and the scallops. Then my husband went with the onion soup and I had the lobster Bisque. Mine however tasted a little bit too bitter for me. For Dinner, we went with the chefs seasonal selection. My husband had the dry aged New York and I have the Filet Minion and bone marrow. Because we ordered so much, and wanted to save space for dessert, we took most of our food home. We had a complimentary souffle for 2 and because it was made to order, it's easier to order it while eating dinner. It was an amazing dinner and Morton's made it a memorable one.",

The hashbrowns tasted burnt and were lukewarm, the chicken Christopher was tasty and piping hot but they didnt flatten or tendorize the chicken. The filet was just average we didnt expect too much. Our party ended with a selection of desserts and while the red velvet cake and cheesecake with ice cream sounded great on the menu it wasnt a hit for us. They served the cake with a rock hard baseball sized scoop of ice cream.  It was a laughable way to end to the meal. Would I go back? Not by a long shot.",

    "text": "Waitress: Pam  Arrived for 7:30 reservation and was seated immediately (I requested a booth and the gentleman seating me pulled out the table for me sit.  Very nice touch!).  Ordered a glass of Markham Sauvignon Blanc.  Very nice, light flavorful taste.  Ordered Prime Pork Chop, Lyonnaise Potatoes (no pepper) & Asparagus.     Bread arrived very quickly, and very hot, like it just came out of the oven.  Needed a knife & folk to cut. Butter melted quickly. Light toasted garlic taste.  Meal arrived 15 mins later. Pork Chop was steaming hot off the grill, cooked all the way through (with butterfly cut).  You can taste the charbroil/grill flavor.  Very good!! The jumbo asparagus was great, not over cooked.  Added some salt.  And the Lyonnaise potatoes were a little bland (most likely from asking for no pepper, but I added salt) and served with cooked onions.  Would have liked some parsley or some herbs added to the potatoes maybe?  But overall very pleased.  And the waitress checked on me 5 mins after meal arrived.  Very attentive.    Lastly, I ordered the creme brulee (with strawberry instead of raspberry).  Arrived within 3 mins.  Had a nice hard texture on top, but the actual cream inside could have set a little thicker (it was borderline runny).    Side note: My waitress was very \"orderly\", she made sure my fork/spoon was readily available once my food arrived, and she swept the crumbs off the table.  Showed she is polished and cares, and she was friendly.  Very pleasant.    Pro Tip: prior to my reservation, I joined the Landry's Club ($25 one time fee, no annual subscription cost), and upon signing up, they give you a $25 credit.  The points were applied to my bill during my visit at Morton's.  So it paid for itself.  Highly recommended.    #PartyOfOne #Fancy #ChristmasDinner",

We hosted our company's Kick Off Party here, through their catering department. Diana T., helped make this event a no brainer, she was very patient with all my questions being answered straight away and explained everything. At the actual function we were attended to by Erica, Jose, and Juan. They were so attentive and pre determined our needs before asking esp. with refills and drink orders. Perfect experience and afterwards many of my co-workers stated that this event was by far the best KickOff yet. I couldn't take any compliments because Morten's staff were just that great. Thank you Diana for everything. Cheers!!!",

    "text": "We came here for our anniversary dinner. It was very good, we left happy, only gave it 4 stars though because its really nothing special for the price. The ambiance was nice. Very classy, not too noisy, open kitchen, yet not too snooty. We started with the french onion and lobster bisque. Both were tasty but for 17$ and 13$ it was just soup. The bread was good, nice and crusty but soft in the center. My boyfriend got the porterhouse(65$) and i got the seafood combo with grilled shrimp, breaded shrimp, and a crab topped salmon (55$). We opted out of sides to save room for dessert. We both enjoyed our entrees (pretty much ate it all), he said the steak was good but just as good as a steak from Maggianos or even The Steakhouse at Circus Circus where its about 10-15$ less and comes with sides and a salad.  I don't eat red meat so everytime we go to a steakhouse i get a seafood dish. This one was one of the best I've had. I got a huge portion and it was extremely tasty. It had a nice lemon sauce and the salmon was cooked perfect. My food was actually incorrect when it came out, it had bacon wrapped scallops instead of the grilled shrimp that it was supposed to come with. I just told our waiter and it was fixed immediately. Not a big deal at all. For dessert, we chose the lava chocolate cake. For 15 dollars it was a dissappointment. It didn't taste bad but it wasn't special. The waiter told us all desserts were made in house but it seemed like any chocolate lava cake you could get at any casual dining restaurant. Nothing was wrong, service was good, food was good, we had a nice evening, but living in Vegas we could probably find a better place for a 250$ (with drinks) dinner. Not to mention a 20% tip. For 300$ we have had better experiences at places like Oscars in the Plaza or Twin Creeks at Silverton.",

The drink was good as was the service form the bartender, a pleasant woman that said she had been there for years.   When the order finally arrived it was past well done. I pointed it out to the bartender who offered to redo the order, but as it took so long to arrive the first time, I declined her offer. I slept on it and decided to e-mail the general manager who expressed concern and offered a $25.00 \"gift\" card to redeem their reputation.   On Monday, 02/10/14, I decided to check them out again by ordering exactly the same thing. The bartender was the same and she was once again pleasant. When the food finally arrived I wondered if it was the same food I'd ordered a year and a half ago. I cut one of the burgers, which more closely resembled a small meat ball,  in half. It was beyond well done. I asked for and spoke with the manager who offered once again to redo the order. I declined his offer as the time invested coupled with the repeat (lack of) performance soured me on the restaurant.   I have had good and even great experiences at the San Diego location.

Unfortunately our last visit was a serious disappointment. The food was good, but the service was poor. Our table was too small for seven people and was right outside of the kitchen, but the real bad-apple was the server. She was inattentive, slow and error-prone. She didn't even bring out the dessert cart, and it was my Mom's 93rd birthday. I filled out the survey and scored it appropriately. The manager later called and seemed a little lackadaisical. I told him the story; he promised to send a gift card.  I just received a gift card for $25. That's right... $25, after spending $2500!  The gift card came from Sr. Vice President of Operations, Tim Whitlock. I really can't think of a better slap-in-the-face than a $25 gift card, after spending $2500.",

I took a wine tasting glass and asked alot of stupid questions, more so then i normally do and who knew?! Lil'bastard studied up on the list. The service was top notch. No glass ever went dry. They would have given me a backrub if I asked, and I thought about it but it would be wierd because I was with a bunch of dudes and I make noises when my back gets rubbed, ya know?. Its pricey, but very much worth it. A friend reported the \"meat sh**s\" the next moring (as its technically called). He was of course, eating 24 oz.'s  Of rare cooked porterhouse steak and finished it all, anyone would in that case... And that goes for anywhere. The sides were stupid good. And the dessert cheesecake was epic. The coffee even tasted high quality. My wallet was very light after.",

She could not have been more wonderful, thoughtful, and efficient if she had tried. Every dealing with her leading up to the event was comfortable and instilled great confidence in us that the event would be a major success. On the date of the event, our waiters--Jessie, Gabriel, and Ron were the most awesome and attentive waitstaff that I have encountered in quite some time. KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU AT MORTON'S LAS VEGAS--you have done what very few restaurants can do these days--DELIVER A TOP-NOTCH, QUALITY EXPERIENCE THAT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY. Thank you for making our special day so very special. We will be back!",

We went recently for our anniversary and Morton's presented us with a custom menu for the occasion.  They also took our picture and presented it to us in a Morton's picture holder.  The service here is simply amazing and we always feel welcome.  But the real reason to come here is the food.  Morton's typically has some fixed-price menu options that they don't advertise, but the servers will tell you about them if you ask.  My wife and I had the $60 Steak and Seafood special, which is a great deal.  We started with the chopped spinach salad with warm bacon dressing, which tastes amazing.  The main course was a filet with your choice of seafood item, I chose the lump crab cake and my wife had the Shrimp Alexander, both excellent.  We got the lyonnaise potatoes and green beans as sides and both were great.  You get a choice of dessert with this deal, so I went with the chocolate lava cake, my personal favorite.  Lots of places do the chocolate lava cake now, but none are as good as Morton's.  I didn't get it this visit, but I would also highly recommend the Cajun Ribeye.  It is simply one of the most flavorful steaks you will ever have.",

The reception had a pre-set entree/menu and everything was OK.  I didn't have steak..I preferred the salmon and it was good.  Their shrimp and crab cakes were very good also (according to my husband, I cannot eat shellfish).  Their house merlot was excellent according to everyone at our table..very smooth.  The wedding cake was an amaretto cake and it was AMAZING!  Their staff was quick and attentive.  One of the big reasons why I am giving this place 4 stars is because of their staff.  Our rental car battery went dead outside the restaurant and at 9:30pm one of the valets went inside and out came an employee who said he would give us a jump!  Wow...never ever expected that...above and beyond..our group was very appreciative and grateful!",

But the steak - which is supposed to be the best part - just didn't live up to my expectations. Nothing to write home about; pretty bland. Definitely not worth what you're paying for. I think I'm more of a Ruth's Chris fan.  The best part was the presentation: When the server showed the plastic-looking lobster - AND IT MOVED - that part was fun!",

I brought the for what was supposed to be a great, once in a lifetime, The ambience and service were great but not the reason to go to Mortons. this was supposed to be an unforgettable bucket list meal. I feel sooooooo screwed!!!.....I've eaten at some fine restaurants like Peter Lugars', Uncle Jacks and others and this ain't them. I've had aged steaks and they say these are aged and the only thing that matches an aged steak is the price.  These are good not great steaks and don't even resemble aged beef. But a lot of people won't even catch it. Sides are overpriced as is everything, steaks are average, 5 jumbo shrimp isn't worth 23 bucks but you pay for the dry ice cloud it sits in I guess, and the big screwing that really pissed me off was the worst effin ever 16 ounce lobster tail at 100$ apeice Lobster meat texture was mushy, black sections from bad processing and blood clots, meat was bland and no ocean taste but also watery from sitting in thaw water or holding pan in the fridge, BIGGEST effin restaurant mistake of my life!!!! I'm no yuppie food channel chef with restaurant in Vegas but I have been a chef in the officers dining areas of the USMC, Marriott and Hilton kitchens and raised on beef farms in the Midwest. Tried to show these people the best of the US to remember forever in their home country but after a bill over 900$ for 4, I feel bent over in Pelican Bay way with no astroglide. Never going here again!!!! I can't believe with all the steak places in Vegas that are a better value for product, I go into this place!!!! Man!!! am I a ripped off dumbass!!!  I'd have done better in a hole in the wall Thai restaurant.  Feel free to call me a dumbass and I'll agree with you. I effed up 900$ bigtime but hope if you go you have a better experience and not feel culinarily raped. should of hauled them to Sapphires, machine gun experience of helicopter tour....

Instead, I sat at the bar and ordered a couple of manhattans and their burger and fries.  First manhattan was good; nothing amazing, but it was great for a well drink. Second was their current drink special, a barrel-aged concoction with corn whiskey, antica vermouth, and peach bitters. It's 15 dollars but very, very much worth it: the drink is phenomenal, subtle and smooth, and it's served with a raquetball-sized sphere of ice so it stays cool without getting watery.  The burger here might have been my favorite of all time; 20 dollars but worth every penny. Big, beefy, and the juiciest I've ever eaten -- definitely the best I've had in LV and a great splurge for payday.  Will probably be back next time my paycheck looks too fat.",

The location is off Strip and has plenty of parking in the back of the building. Morton's also offers valet, but being off Strip it doesn't really seem necessary to valet.   The inside of the restaurant was a bit old school. The restaurant is on the dark side and not overly large. There are rooms for large groups off of the main dining area, but the main dining area is essentially one large room. They offer a combination of tables and booths.  The onion bread to start was tasty. The Morton's salad was okay and did the trick for a serving of vegetables. It was not the most exciting salad though. My filet was delicious, tender and buttery. It was prepared as I requested. I loved my sides, mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Dessert was a chocolate mousse, it was creamy and full of chocolate flavor.",

My NY strip was the thinnest I've ever seen - about 3 inches wide. It was super fatty, not marbled as it should have been, and the steak seemed to be flavored with uncleaned grill. Our truffle fries arrived room temp, like they'd been sitting in a window for a while before they made it to the table. I could have saved $250 and had a better experience. Will not give them another shot next time I'm in Vegas.",

Started with the shrimp cocktail which comes out on dry ice, making a really cool presentation and escargot which had an incredible rich butter garlic sauce. The salads were nice and fresh.  We had the wedge, done traditionally with blue cheese and tomatoes.  The steaks were prepared as ordered and the sides were good.  Try the Brussel sprouts.  They are delicious.   To end the meal we had a dessert of key lime pie and the chocolate mousse.  Both excellent and just enough sweet to be content.   Lastly the bartender was great and made my drink to order as it was not on the menu.  Cucumber martini. You must try it.",

It's an ideal place to go if you don't like your meat with a bit of flavor.   I was also underwhelmed with their lobster mac. The food could've been better, maybe because it was the Vegas location. Idk.   We had a great view of the Vegas strip from our table.   The sever kept trying to pressure us to add drinks to our order even though we told her we weren't drinking that night. It almost ruined my experience but she eventually left us alone.  We spent about $200 for a table of two, including left overs. Not bad!",

We eat at this location several times a year and it is always a great experience - we would eat there more often, but live on the far west side of town and it's not always convenient to fight traffic.  Mark, one of the managers and sommelier, always greets us and visits several times during dinner to ensure we are pleased with the food and service.  In addition, we always look forward to seeing Congi (sp?) the bartender - she wasn't there this visit, but David and Alex did a great job on our martinis!  While the steaks are always great, I ordered and had the best veal chop I think I have ever enjoyed - we took advantage of a special, the Summer Steak and Seafood menu, which included salad or appetizer, filet and a choice of seafood (I had the crab cake), side and dessert.  Between a reasonable upcharge to the veal chop and sharing sides with 3 others, we had a great meal at a reasonable price.  We have a Fleming's Restaurant very close to our house, but would much rather drive a longer distance for a much better steak and dinner.",

They gave us a special birthday menu that we got to take home with us. They also took a photo & gave it to us to keep in a little paper photo holder from Morton's.

Last night too many patrons (more than two tables) in collarless shirts and shorts, and one table with three guys in jeans, tee shirts and baseball caps. And yes, they wore the caps throughout their meal.  I guess the restaurant business in LV has gotten so competitive that Morton's and maybe others, have lowered their standards rather than risk having to send away a paying customer.  If you just want a decent expensive steak, Morton's is still your place. But if you want it to be a \"special\" dinner or business meeting, there are way more options in town.",

The location is easily accessible from the strip so it's not so long to get to.  I've been to many steakhouse and restaurants in Vegas and going to Morton's was a nice change of pace. There wasn't much that completely made the experience unique from the others, but overall, we had a great time.  House cabernet was excellent, salad and sides were very well portioned (we had so many including different mashed potatoes, lobster Mac, and veggie plates) and all were delicious.  Shrimp cocktail had great presentation but wasn't the best I've had. Most of us ordered a filet mignon or the ribeye. Well cooked!! That's definitely important. You may choose to add a topping like butter if that's your thing.  We were so full so shared the cheesecake and the birthday boy got his own cake and candle. We were all able to get a group photo of us and the service throughout the evening was outstanding.  The only thing that was slightly off was seeing a charging cable attached to the wall of the entrance as we walked into the restaurant. Not so classy but an easy fix. ;)",

I think someone forgot to put in the lobster flavoring. Lastly, the steaks were both undercooked. One was ordered rare the other medium neither was cooked correctly. The only positive thing was the service that's why I'm giving this review 3 stars. Save your money and go someplace else. I know I will.",

The atmosphere is classy and upscale but when you look around at the other patrons a lot of them were in jeans and shirt while our office was dressed pretty fancy. I mean there were other patrons in nice fancy clothes also, but I guess seeing jeans and a t-shirt in this restaurant threw me off a little. Next time I come here I won't have to be all dolled up, haha, I'd rather be comfy! Anyway, we have a certain menu for our group so we all had a salad and had the option to choose from an 8oz filet mignon, salmon, or chicken. I chose the salmon and I'm so glad I did!!! Just thinking about it makes me crave it even more. It was nice and crispy on the outside but inside was nice & tender. The flavor was amazing!! We received 2 sides which were the au gratin potatoes & green beans, the potatoes were delish and the green beans were good but not as amazing at the potatoes. For dessert I had the key lime pie which was also very yummy!! I also had a cocktail drink, I totally forgot the name but it had Hennessy & Grand Marnier liquor in it with pineapple juice and some other juices. It was a little strong for me. My coworker had the Holiday Bliss drink & that was actually really good. I would definitely come back and try other items on the menu. Oh and the service was wonderful. Everyone was great!",

I was seated promptly--it was right at opening and the place was very quiet. a big seller.  I was left a menu and brought the iced tea I wanted.  After looking at the menu, I opted for lobster bisque as a starter, the 16 ounce NY strip for a main, a baked potato for the side, and I finished dinner with their Grand Marnier souffle which my server, Linsey, said was her favorite and ordered often.  The lobster bisque was the standout of the evening.  It ranks with the best I've had.  The bisque was very rich.  There was one larger piece of lobster and two smaller ones--about normal for lobster bisque.  I asked for the steak to be blue and it was done a bit more than that.  Their steaks are broiled and I watched the chef doing several during my stay there.  The steak was flavorful but it was nothing I can't get at a cheaper price in some of the Strip hotel steakhouses.  The baked potato was large.  Linsey put butter and sour cream and I could have had bacon, too, but I passed on that.  The souffle was ordered at the beginning so there was plenty of time to make it.  This was the first time being served a souffle that the server didn't ask if I wanted them to pierce the top and pour the liquid into the souffle.  Rather, the dish was placed on my table and a small gravy boat holding the Grand Marnier sauce was placed on the side and I was told to enjoy.  Service was good.  Linsey was personable and helpful with questions.  The pace of the meal was a bit too fast.  There was only a short break between courses.  Had I been with a group of people, I would have wanted to have some down time to talk with friends.  I was out in about an hour to give an idea of how things moved along.  A couple of peeves I have.  One is a bit silly, perhaps, but I dine solo and am often seated at a table meant for four.  After the three other place settings have been removed, invariably the salt and pepper are moved to the farthest end of the table which causes me to have to stand up and do a long reach across the table to get the salt and pepper.  I'm solo.  You don't need to make extra room in the middle of the table.  The other peeve is the valet parking.  This is not a large casino where I have a long walk to get to a restaurant.  Tuesday night, every spot but the handicapped spots, had a cone placed in front of them.  You had to park either in the back and walk or on the side and walk around the wall to get to the entrance.  I guess this is a money maker but I find it terribly inconvenient and unnecessary.  I think with the prices charged here, I'm paying a lot for parking.  This is not a place to which I'd return.",

The lyonnaise potatoes were one of the best things I've ever eaten. So good I would have Liked to have another order. Broccoli was good as well.

Our waiter was no where to be seen, so I got up and was talking the raw veal back to the kitchen,  the waiter popped up and agreed...the meat was raw. He takes it to the kitchen...the \"cook\" chars the meat and ruined the veal completely...our dinner there was so bad, the manager didn't charge us for anything.  My advice...don't go there! Go to Smith & Wollensky or Joes at Caesars. Mortons has gone down hill big time.",

    "text": "I'm looking at other reviews, so I must have had amazing experiences the other times I've been here, and most recently, for my birthday dinner. I love it  when you give Morton's a heads up that you're there for a special occasion, they will provide a customized menu with the mention of it :). Heck, they even ask if you want a picture of the night and present it to you in a lovely personalized card. How sweet. It's the little touches that I love!   Utilized that complimentary valet and walked right in to our booth with hot bread already awaiting us! Brandon was our waiter for the night and that guy was absolutely awesome on service from beginning to the very end. Professional and personable, he made the experience of dining here is worth it over the other steeakhouses throughout Vegas.  You can't go wrong with the Cajun Ribeye steak. It's a lotta meath!!! (that's what she said!)  I tried the 6 oz. filet mignon with 3 grilled shrimp and 2 bacon wrapped scallops. OMG...this was so damn good! You get variety of meat, but boy on boy, they cook the scallops here so perfect, they melt in your mouth! Delish!!!!  This location didn't quite get the sauteed brussels sprouts down--that needs improvement.  Bacon and onion mac and cheese here is decadent. DECADENT.  Get a split of a chopped spinach salad to pretend that you got something remotely \"healthy\" at a steakhouse ;). It's good nonetheless from that reason.  With all that food, definitely save room for their desserts. I opted for their chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream to round out our gluttony. I won't lie, I think I popped one of my pant's buttons.  All in all, this Morton's location has never failed me!",

Not far from the strip its a short and cheap cab ride. Simple one page menu and not as noisy as most other steakhouse so the strip. Everything is good. If you like a veal chop look no further. Totally awesome in their own truffle butter sauce. The filet mignon is awesome. Plenty of side fixings to order from. Very attentive wait staff. Definitely will eat here again",

    "text": "My wife and I had reservations at another restaurant on the strip for our anniversary, but it was a holiday weekend and I didn't want to risk having a bad experience due to crowds. Good friend told me to call Morton's and let them know it was our anniversary and I am glad I did. Took a short cab ride from the Venetian and were there in 10 mins. We were greeted at the front, wished a happy anniversary, and walked right to our table. Server was very personable and got us started with a couple drinks and an appetizer. The server had excellent timing. He knew when to ask us when we were ready to order and didn't make us feel rushed at all. The bacon wrapped mozzarella was excellent. Waiter recommended the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella and it did not disappoint. We skipped the salads so we wouldn't get too full before the main course. My wife ordered the 6oz filet \"Oscar Style\". It was cooked to her liking and she really enjoyed it. I got the special, which was a bone-in filet. It was absolutely delicious. So tender and cooked just right. The sides (mushrooms and were Lyonnaise potatoes) were both very tasty with no complaints from the wife. As an added bonus the waiter informed us that dessert was on them and gave us a few options to choose from. Although we were extremely full, we went with the chocolate lava cake with ice cream. It came on a plate with a single lit candle. Nice touch. This was our first experience with Morton's and we were not disappointed. Next time we are in Vegas and want a nice steak, we will make a reservation at Morton's.",

But what made our first New Year's Eve together joyfully memorable was the service.  Everyone at Morton's went out of their way to take great care of us and celebrate the night.  Kevin was our Host, at least it felt that way, and he was perfect from start to finish!  Even though he had to work in NYE, he mad it seem like he didn't want to be anywhere else.  I actually cannot wait to go back and will definitely ask for Kevin.  Thank you Morton's!!  Happy New Year Everyone!",

I dropped in recently for dinner with a buddy. I love the feel of the more 'classic style' rooms. I know that Morton's is by no means an icon on the food scene in Las Vegas, but it is definitely a nice change of pace to dining on the Strip or at one of the pricier steakhouses (which I also love, too much;)   Morton's was recently acquired by Landry's, and thus a few things changed.. nothing really in terms of quality, just a few more promotions and a few additions to the food menu.   I drop in for Happy Hour now and then, and sometimes for a full dinner. The room is comfortable, the drinks are stiff, and some of my favorite servers have been there for years. Every time, the staff is warm and smiling and the food is consistently good. What else can you ask for?  If you have't had a chance to go or haven't been in awhile.. stop by. I think you will find a sense of quality at Morton's that has been missing on the dining scene lately.  Happy Eating!",

Also came with a large portion of horseradish mashed potatoes. Super horse-radishy but I love horseradish so I thought they were delectable. Boyfriend got the Chicago Ribeye I think and that was pretty good. It was really tender and cooked perfectly.  To end the dinner, they brought out a souffle with whipped cream in a gravy boat and stuck a candle in it! It was really good, super fluffy and a hint of lemon. Didn't look at the check very hard before sticking my credit card in there but I'm pretty sure it was free since it was his birthday so that was fantastic :)",

    "text": "***UPDATE 9/20/2019*** I received a phone call from the restaurant General Manager to discuss my experience.   Morton's is the classic steakhouse - fantastic steaks, an amazing wine and cocktail list, the freshest and most perfectly cooked seafood, and impeccable service.  Last night was mostly the same, except it wasn't what I would call the \"usual Morton's experience.\"  I feel like I'm in a bad AT&T commercial when I say \"just ok is not ok,\" but last nights meal was just that - ok.  Just my opinion though but for $175 per person you might expect a little more than \"ok.\"  I'll admit that this review could also be a little biased - after all, I have previously had the most fantastic experiences at Morton's so there is a high bar for comparison.   A little history...  My birthday is in August, my boyfriends birthday is end of July. With work, travel, birthday parties for us and for friends, and just daily life we haven't been able to find that one night when we could get out for a special \"just us\" dinner.  Time is flying so yesterday I made reservations. They ask if there is a special occasion so I said it was a birthday meal.  Last year we also went to Morton's for birthday dinner and it was special - part of the reason I chose the same place again. Last year we were greeted with Happy Birthday from the hostess and then server and then even the manager that stopped by the table to make sure everything was perfect; they took our picture and gave us a printed copy in a Morton's folder to remember the evening. It was Morton's and it felt special. Last night though - nothing. Why even ask if it's a special occasion if you're not going to do anything with it?  So, it's a restaurant review, let's talk food. I ordered 2 appetizers (crab cake and bacon steak) a salad and soup (tomato & blue cheese and lobster bisque) 2 entrees (prime ribeye and filet mignon mixed grill), 2 sides (mashed potatoes and creamed spinach), a cocktail - the classic State Street Manhattan, and a glass of wine for with my steak. Oh, and Key Lime Pie for dessert.  The crab cake was pure perfection - everything that crab hoped to be after being caught. The meat was sweet and soft, with a textbook cook that was slight crispy outside. It did fall apart a little - which happens when a crab cake is made with so much crab and so little filler.  I could literally eat like 3 or 4 of these and nothing else.  The bacon steak was tasty, though unevenly cooked leaving one side crispy and one side chewy.   The beefsteak tomato and blue cheese salad was as you'd expect. The one surprise here was the inconsistency of the cuts.  I had one beautiful thick cut of tomato and another that was so thin it resembled prosciutto.  My Chef Instructor would have had some words for me if I brought him knife cuts like that.     The lobster bisque was meh. Tony loves lobster bisque and last nights was extremely watery and lacked flavor.  From now on lobster bisque only at Chart House.  The steaks were cooked perfectly as ordered - with that Morton's char and seat on the outside and a juicy interior. No sauces needed here (though if you want to they'll add one of their signature sauces for a small upcharge).  Tony's mixed grill came with two bacon wrapped scallops and two grilled shrimp. The seafood was also perfectly cooked - scallops were tender and sweet, not chewy at all.  The menu said \"sour cream mashed potatoes\" but all I tasted was potato - no sour cream, butter, salt or pepper.  Honestly - the mashed potatoes at Cracker Barrel taste better.  Next time it's the baker.  The creamed spinach was the classic steakhouse side and done perfectly with a rich, creamy, cheesy flavor.   Key lime pie. Say no more. I've never seen a key like pie I didn't like (except those fake ones that are neon green and aren't really key limes).  The service was adequate but not special. We were greeted promptly, he offered suggestions, highlighted the specials.  He timed the meal nicely, each course arriving only once the prior course had been cleared. He didn't pay particular attention to details - my cocktail was empty and another server finally came by and offered a refill.  I asked about two wines which I was considering for with my steak, he didn't ask questions about the kind of flavors I like just straight to what he likes.  After the bill was paid though I felt almost pushed out the door.  We were slowly nibbling on the pie and I had 3/4 of a cocktail to finish, when he asked for my valet ticket to get my car pulled up. I was a good 10 minutes from leaving and the valet are is only one car wide, so if it was up front then it was time to go.  This is Las Vegas - there are plenty (PLENTY!) of great steakhouses both up and down the strip and in our local neighborhoods.  You can't go wrong with a meal at Morton's - the food will be great.  But if there's nothing special about the experience then there are other steakhouses that might be a better choice for a special occasion.",

We got two of the cocktails and they were meh.   I ordered the Cajun steak and my husband got filet mignon and two lobster tails and a loaded potato. I wasn't impressed with my steak. The flavor was good but it wasn't super tender and melt in your mouth like I was hoping for with the price. Made me wish we had gone to Ruth Chris. And it was undercooked but I just went with it. I also had the au gratin potatoes and those were pretty good!   My husbands filet was so much better! And he said he loved his lobster. Better than Ruth Chris lobster. The potato was kind of whatever.  Glad we tried may or may not be back.",

Steaks are cooked perfectly - for me it's a ribeye or NY strip - medium with extra char and I usually skip the sides because I NEED a chocolate souffle for dessert every time.  The souffles take approximately 25 minutes to prepare so order ahead or  just chill and wait for it. Don't like chocolate? They have lemon and raspberry souffles too.   Service is consistently great - attentive and friendly. The Vegas location has a more casual feel than the San Francisco one but that's not necessarily a bad thing.   Definitely one of my all-time favorites.",

    "text": "My bf took me here for my birthday recently. A good location off the strip with complimentary valet parking. When we walked in, we were greeted immediately. Since we had reservations, we were seated immediately. The dining area seemed a bit small and all the tables were located near each other so it was a bit loud.   We were greeted by our waiter and he did go over the menu with us but it was a bit difficult to understand him with a heavy accent and fast paced talking. We ordered our drinks and it was great! I ended up with the 10oz filet mignon with a bone marrow ($69) and the bf got the prime cajun ribeye ($57). We also ordered a side of sour cream mashed potatoes ($13) and the lobster mac n cheese ($25). We were served fresh bread and butter which was really good because the bread was coated with fried garlic.   The filet mignon was super tender and juicy; cooked to medium with a light pink center. The bone marrow was just the icing on top. Lots of marrow on a good sized bone. I topped it on the filet and some bread and it was to die for. Everything just melted in my mouth and was super juicy. The ribeye on the other hand was dry and burnt in some places. Didn't really taste much Cajun on there and wasn't very flavorful. It had some really tough edges because it was way overcooked. We didn't enjoy this dish as much.   The mashed potatoes were great! They just tasted like regular mashed potatoes. And the lobster mac and cheese was alright. It had a bit of a tangy taste to it probably from some type of cheese. We also didn't enjoy it as much since it wasn't cheddar-y enough...it was more white tangy cheese than the savory yellow cheddar.   Since it was my birthday, they did offer me a complimentary souffle so I got the chocolate one. It was alright....not too great. I have had better souffle elsewhere and it just doesn't compare. Overall, I enjoyed most of the dishes we had. The service could have been better, we had to wave down the waiter a couple times and sometimes we couldn't find him. I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars but their filet mignon was really good. I had leftovers and the filet was still juicy when reheated.",

The \"power hour\"  is from open to 6:30, and from 9:30 to close, every day. This is the best time to come for appetizers, and the bar opens at 4 on Friday & Saturday, and at 5 all other days. \"Bar Bites\" Appetizers, available at the bar only, are $7, $8 and $9.  I recommend the Filet Trio, which comes with amazing sauces to complement the yummy filet, a good price at $9. I also had the BLT crab cakes, also $9, these were fine but dry.  I asked for mayo and lemon, and that did the trick! Another favorite is the parmesan truffle matchstick fries.  A few of us shared this appetizer, and everyone agreed they could eat an entire portion. Noted!   \"Power Hour\" martinis and cocktails are $9, and include a vodka or gin martini, Manhattan and cosmopolitan, among others. Wine is $8, choice of 10, including a sangria and a malbec. Draft beer is $5.50, which is a pretty good price. Some choices are Heineken and Sam Adams seasonal.  I had a Manhattan, which was very good. I've also had the palm beacher, a tropical martini. Both are recommended.",

A few minutes off the strip, and away from the mundane chaos of Vegas is this destination of epic dining experiences. Ask for Teri, she is truly the best. Our first visit we were sat in her area and she was so attentive it was astounding. I love how they offer sparkling water (tap water in Vegas is gross!) and how quickly they arrive with the first round of drinks.  I personally loved the add on option of Foie Gras. I had it the first night and how tenderly seared it was... I had to have it a second night on top of my steak choice.   On our second night here, we learned that Teri was a trainer! We were so thankful we learned how truly invested she was with Morton's because her skills in providing the BEST experience possible, clearly is represented by us asking to be sat in her section again. Once again, I enjoyed the same dish as before.   I love how the little crumble scoop comes out between platings and how perfectly polite each one of the team at this location is.  If you're looking to escape the strip but have a wonderful dining experience, look no further than this location!!!",

    "text": "What can I say but extremely disappointed.  This is not our first visit to Morton's but will definitely be our last.  From walking in the front door and not being immediately greeted like usual should have let me know something was off.  I will mention now there were only 4 tables seated when we arrived and no more than 10 at any given time, so being busy is not an excuse.  Once we were seated it took almost 5 minutes to be acknowledged by our waiter.  It was at this time I informed him the table was off balance and asked for a shim to level it out.  He said he would get right on it and walked away.  We placed our order and my wife, prior to the waiter leaving the table, changed her order to lobster tail.  The waiter even tried to up sell her on two 11 oz tails instead of the single, indicating he understood the change of order.  In the meantime 15 minutes after my original request to level the table, we still could not touch the table or our water would spill from the glass.  I finally just asked to move tables.  We were seated in a booth, and watched as they reset the table we were at without fixing the problem.  Our food was finally brought to our table, however, the waiter brought my wife the wrong order.  I asked him about this and he replied he made a mistake and would go and get the correct order.  He walked away and left my food on the table.  Being out at a nice restaurant, I am not going to eat while my wife watches me so I pushed my plate to the end of the table.  This is when a manager approaches and inquires to the problem.  After explaining, I told him to cancel my order because my food would be cold by the time my wife's was served.  He took my plate and ensured me it too would also be remade so we could eat together and have warm meals.  It was by this time, we were both  frustrated with the extremely poor service and our appetites were gone.  My wife's lobster, once delivered was good and my filet and shrimp were decent, the side of Brussels were very over cooked and bland.    I am not one to complain and expect a comp meal, but after this experience I would have expected not to have said a word, instead just to have been told they were taking care of it.  In fact, this is the first time I have given a review, which should lend some evidence to the horrible evening.  I hope this is an isolated incident, but based on the lack of patrons in an usually busy restaurant I think it probably is not.  Very sad because the Morton's of old would have never allowed any of this to happen.",

    "text": "Finally I dined at a Morton's Steakhouse after planning to do so for years.  And I was well repaid by a fine dining experience on the tail end of Restaurant Week after a 4-hour drive to get back to Vegas before the 2018 version of RW came to a close.  Diane and I agreed that this year Morton's had the best selection of RW menu items to satisfy our tastes, which we still augmented a bit to try out additional dishes, taking into account that a three-course meal plus one side was being offered at a price ($50) that was less than one steak alone on the regular menu.  So, we began with two appetizers: a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and Bacon Wrapped Sea Scallops.  Five good-sized shrimp were presented with an excellent Cocktail Sauce, and the shrimp were meaty but not really sweet.  Three delicately cooked luminescent Sea Scallops each seated on a green leaf were encircled by a long strip of pliable cooked bacon.  They were quite tasty but quickly dispatched.  While Diane then opted for a cup of velvety Lobster Bisque, next for me was a cup of Five Cheese Baked Onion Soup, which was an excellent rendition of French Onion Soup, with well caramelized onions and a nicely melted cheesy top.  Next time I will order a bowl!  I should mention that the soup went very well with buttered chunks of bread from a clearly house-baked onion-studded loaf.  I then enjoyed a large classic Caesar Salad topped by an elongated breakable crouton and two requested anchovies.  The Romaine Lettuce was fresh, and the Caesar Dressing creamy and delicious.  Perfectly medium-rare 8 oz. Choice Grade Center Cut Filet Mignon steaks were next up for both of us, presented with requested complimentary Bearnaise Sauce and unasked for au jus.  The Bearnaise Sauce was good but appeared to have broken before it reached our table, whereas the au jus was particularly tasty ladled over the very juicy, buttery, and well-seasoned meat that tasted more like Prime Grade beef.  \"Twice Baked\" Au Gratin Potatoes were a superb included side, while Diane, who disdains horseradish on anything, was presented with specially prepared plain Mashed Potatoes topped by Gruyere, two Sharp Cheddar Cheeses, and pieces of bacon at no additional charge.  She liked this dish well enough to have its remnants packed up for lunch the next day.  By this time we were both really full, but still eagerly awaited the included desserts.  While Diane delighted in a Hot Chocolate Cake that had a molten center and was enhanced by a large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, I liked my generous slice of Key Lime Pie sporting a very tasty crumbling Graham Cracker Crust bottom.  The pie filling was not very tart and tasted more like lemon than lime, which I prefer.  This pastry was topped by a delectable cloud of Whipped Cream, which I washed down with a cup of Coffee made from French coffee beans.  For unknown reasons only half a cup of coffee was initially poured for me, but I quickly received a generous additional cupful upon request.  Service by our server Davis was excellent and accommodating, and our seating luxurious in a large white-linen-tablecloth-topped booth that was clad in faux alligator skin.   I just thought it was odd that a steak knife had to be used for everything, including the buttering of bread, although we were provided with changes of steak knives as various courses arrived.  XXXX-1/2 stars overall, so I will definitely not wait for the next Restaurant Week to come around to make a return visit.",

    "text": "Generally, a solid choice for upscale steak, but there are definitely better steakhouse options in Las Vegas.  As expected, the decor is dark wood and white tablecloths. Valet is complementary (and mandatory, no option to park your own car in their lot). We were greeted promptly and seated right away for our 8p reservation. We had a lovely booth and the host moved the table so I could enter.  Service was good throughout and our water glasses kept full. Complementary onion bread was warm, although I found it slightly odd that they didn't have a butter knife for spreading the butter- we just used our steak knives, which were replaced when our main course arrived.   There is a 3 course surf and turf dinner that is not listed on the menu, but available upon request. With it, you get a choice of a Caesar or chopped salad, a 6oz filet mignon with a choice of either a crab cake, shrimp, or bacon wrapped scallops and a dessert. I opted for this, with the chopped salad, crab cake, and bacon and onion Mac and cheese. It is $63, which is very fair for all you received.   My boyfriend got the bone in ribeye ($59), loaded baked potato, and spinach and mushrooms. I believe sides are $15 each. He said the ribeye was good, although he expected a thicker cut.   My filet was just ok. It was cooked properly (medium), but was on the tough side. My crab cake was good, but could have used a bit more seasoning. All of the sides were great! The Mac and cheese was the standout. The loaded potato came with a table side presentation of butter, sour cream, and bacon. We did find it odd that cheese was not an option as well, but it was still tasty.  My creme brulee was lovely, light and the perfect end to the meal. The total was $165 before tip (we didn't order drinks), and I felt the price was fair for the food and experience overall.   In summary, I wouldn't rush to return, but I wouldn't be upset if someone took me back!",

From the moment we walked in the door we had a perfect evening.   They made a personalized menu for us that said \"Happy 54th Anniversary \".   My father had the double lobster tail, my spouse and I had steaks prepared to perfection and my mom had scallops. We chose creamed corn au gratin potato's as side dishes along with soups and salads.   My parents also had their first ever souffle which was prepared perfectly (I've had Eiffel before).   I cannot express enough how grateful I am for the wonderful service and food. When people treat my parents well, I never forget that kindness.   I look forward to a return visit.",

We were greeted warmly by the hostess who had us promptly seated. While we were browsing thru the menu, comes the amazing bread with butter!!   We started with their chopped salad served perfectly chilled, with cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, feta cheese and finely chopped eggs. Sooo good!   My kids shared filet mignon which was great. Hubby loved the miso sea bass.  For sides I highly recommend creamed corn which has the most tender sweet corn and their Parmesan and truffle matchstick fries. They are not shy adding truffle to those fries!! Loved it!  I am happy that we were not charged extra for splitting our salad and filet.   Wine selection was great and their somm is one of the friendliest in town.   For dessert we had Morton's legendary hot chocolate cake, probably the best lava cake in Vegas! You need to order this 20 mins ahead of time. Our waitress was wonderful about letting us know that.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been here several times, the one constant is the service is always top notch, the team does a great job, however we recently have seen the food quality start to decline.  So you may ask, then why the 5 stars? On this visit, I felt like I was back at the Mortons we had known from a few years ago and along with the continued great service, just a awesome dining experience.  Today's visit was to celebrate my wife's birthday, as Laundry members, for birthday's, the company gives a $25 credit, pair that with a Lobster special and being restaurant week and we couldn't resist.   Food quality - My wife ordered from the restaurant week prefix and I reserved a lobster. As always we started with a appetizer of the short rib tacos. The taco's were amazing, meat cooked perfect, the sauce was on point. My wife ordered the 8 out filet, again was cooked as ordered. I had the lobster. Now I know it was good but what sealed it was my wife, who doesn't usually like shell fish, kept picking at my lobster which was a key indication that the meal was made perfect.   Service - No matter what, the team is always taking care of the guests and I have never had a bad experience at any Mortons I have visited. Luke and the team continued that tradition with great service. The team worked very well together, not once was our drink glasses empty, or did we want for anything, and the restaurant was busy so no one was standing around.   In conclusion, I was very happy that we dined here today and do defiantly think the quality of food is where you would expect from a steakhouse in Vegas in where every casino seems to have a advertised high end steakhouse, so there is more competition than in other cities. This location did a great job and look forward to our next return.",

    "text": "Came to Morton's for restaurant week. The price was $50.13 per person and they had a special menu where you could pick between a couple different things. We started out with a large loaf of onion bread. The bread wasn't bad but I could only eat so much. Next came the French onion soup. I could have picked up and drank it in 3 gulps it was so small. The soup had a very bland flavor. Then my steak and sides came. The filet was cooked the way I asked and didn't taste bad but certainly isn't worth what they are charging. I have had better steak at high end steakhouses on the strip. The sides I shared with my wife, we had the sour cream mashed potatoes and lyonnaise potatoes. The mashed was not bad but the lyonnaise potaotes were just gross. The onions were very overcooked and chewy. The potatoes weren't at all what my wife showed me in other pictures on yelp. Then came dessert. I chose the strawberry cheesecake and it couldn't have been anymore flavorless. The portions for restaurant week were way smaller then if you just came in and ordered from their regular menu which is a scam to me. The food just wasn't good and a waste of money.  Our server was very good. He checked on us often. One of the servers mentioned that Morton's was undergoing a remodel and said we were lucky to be seated in a booth in the corner because then we wouldn't be bothered by dust like some other customers. You should never ever talk about that with people about to eat in your restaurant.    The parking sucks. The front of the restaurant is reserved for valet only. All other patrons must park behind the restaurant and walk around. Not very classy.",

It was around six on a Monday evening and it was almost completely empty other than two or three tables, and it still took a very long time for someone to come to us. We opted for bar seating, and happy hour but asked for a regular menu as well. We alternated between two servers, who were not extremely busy yet took a long time to take our order, bring the food, and check up on us.   The Filet Trio was seriously underwhelming, none of the sauces were good, and the filet was definitely not the tender cut of beef I'm accustomed to, it was hard and difficult to cut in to even though we ordered it medium rare. The caeser salad is good, very fresh and crisp lettuce, however completely drenched in dressing. The french onion soup, had a strange consistency, not even like soup but tasted fine. My girl friend ordered a few other small plates that I wasn't interested in trying but she said they were okay.   For a restaurant of this caliber, I dont know, I just expected....more.",

It was rich, juicy and perfectly seasoned. They must cure it in house because it is nothing like store bought bacon. For dinner I had their house red wine, a Chicago bone in ribeye a lb of king crab legs and the button mushrooms with spinach. My steak was perfectly marbles and cooked amazing. It still blows my mind that Morton's can get a beautiful crispy outside in a steak while keeping the inside properly cooked rare. The king crab was fresh and served hot despite that the legs were split down the middle. I find most restaurants end up serving it cold because it takes a while to split them, not Morton's; they nailed the timing. Morton's is the most expensive dinner I have ever had, and I may have gone a little bit overboard getting an entire lb of crab to myself, but I would have happily paid even more for perfection.",

Well, after saying for so many years that other places were not as good as Mortons (and some recent bad experiences at other steak restaurants in Vegas -- see my other Yelp reviews), I decided to go back to see if Mortons was still as good as I remembered.   Long story short - Mortons did not disappoint.  I will not wait another decade before going back  Mortons definitely sets a standard by which all other restaurants should strive to reach in terms of both customer service and food quality.  It was a birthday celebration.  Mortons knew in advance and provided personalized menus with name and date at the top.  Nice touch.  Lady came by during the dinner and offered to take a picture at no charge.  Later provided it in a personalized Morton's paper frame (we tipped $5).  Another nice touch -- and better deal than what I remember a long time ago with the Cashman photogs patronizing these places.  Spouse enjoyed the escargot appetizer (the best she has encountered -- good presentation, bread underneath was a great touch).  She ordered the seafood mix grill -- crab cakes, grilled shrimp, shrimp Alexander.  She thought the shrimp Alexander was overcooked and too salty, but I tried it and liked it.  The service and overall experience made up for any minor flaws in that dish.      I passed on the appetizer even though I remember the shrimp cocktail being very good (I can't eat as much as I could a decade ago).  I'm at a steak house, so I'm here to eat steak.  I ordered NY strip, medium well.   Order of the truffle fries for the table.  I don't know what Morton's secret is, but they know how to cook a steak perfectly so that it is exactly how I want it (medium well, just a little pink) and yet the steak is so warm and juicy that you don't even need to use any steak sauce to eat it (which is one way I judge a steak -- if I can enjoy it without any steak sauce).  The steak was simply amazing -- just as good as Mortons.    Finally, for dessert, ordered the chocolate lava cake.  Came out on decorated plate as you would expect when you have a special occasion dinner at such a fine dining establishment.  And the dessert was complimentary (they didn't bring out some cheap dessert they give for free -- we ordered the dessert we wanted and they gave it to us complimentary).   Sadly, even though this is the way all high end steak houses should be, more and more you are seeing these places not go to such extra lengths.  Not at Mortons.  They still know what it means to be a high end steakhouse and how to provide their customers with a fine dining experiences.    If you've ever been afraid of going to Mortons because it's a chain, let me assuage those concerns.  I've been to numerous other steak restaurants that are supposedly the best -- and none of them match Mortons.  Many of them come close, but Mortons remains the best in my book.  I will not wait another decade before going back.",

My favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. It has this old school vibe, like the movie casino. The setting and dim lighting is very romantic. I made a reservation online for my boyfriends birthday, upon receiving our menu it had a special announcement on the menu saying Happy Birthday with his name on it. The service was exceptionally great, our waiter was very knowledgeable and kind. We ordered scallops as an appetizer, they were to die for. Between the Chilean sea bass and the steak you can't go wrong. Every taste is so rich in flavor, the steak is very juicy and prepared like I asked. Will definitely be back.",

I sat at the bar and ordered a Caesar salad, and a 8oz filet. Both items were delicious and the steak was cooked as ordered.  The service was great as well. I was the only person at the bar though.   The location is a bit strange, in what seems like a dumpy part of town, at least in the eyes of an out-of-towner, but the inside was very nice. They do offer valet parking for all of the up-front parking spaces, and self park is in the back.   I'll probably go back tonight.",

Whenever we have gone we've had the Steak and Seafood dinner for Two.  Each person gets a salad, entree, two veggie sides, a choice of seafood, and a dessert for a grand total of $109.  How can that be beat?  My steak has always been perfectly medium rare, the scallops are sizable, and the Lyonaise potatoes are delicious!

    "text": "What sets this steakhouse apart from other steakhouses?  Nothing!  It's nice, classy, white tablecloths, obsequious waiters, good food, big cuts of meat, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, blah blah blah.  There are a million other places JUST LIKE THIS in Vegas... in fact, there's one at every hotel!  But I guess if you crave the familiarity of a chain, you might take solace in the fact that this Morton's is like all the other Morton'ses -- i.e, they show you shrink-wrapped cuts of meat and ask that you order your desert souffle before you even start the main course (mood killer!).  Nice, solid, boring.  Perfect for a business dinner... but not much fun for anything else. What I ate and drank here: started with a cucumber Mortini and a Sazerac (can't really mess those up too badly).  Followed with chopped salad (meh...chopped salad doused in vinegar dressing; nothing more, nothing less) and onion soup (pretty good, but nothing really stood out over other onion soups). App was shrimp Alexander (good... nice big shrimp coated in delicious buttery garlic crustiness).  Entree was Cajun ribeye and crab legs (nice big juicy crab legs; steak was very tender and fatty and well-seasoned) accompanied by creamed spinch (nothing noteworthy there) and mac and cheese (good, if you're a mac fan -- crusty and white-cheesy with nice, big noodles).  Dessert was Grand Marnier souffle (meh.  WTF is the big deal with the souffles here?! It was okay, but nothing special) followed by Frangelico. Service was attentive but kind of annoyingly peppy and boisterous.  Some like it that way, I suppose...but to me, it was like being served steak by the Southwest Airlines flight crew.  Whee! All in all, being as there are SOOOO many other steakhouse options in Vegas, I would say that if you're looking to have a good steak dinner, it's the ambience that makes the difference.  And I can name several places in town at comparable prices with a more interesting ambience!",

    "text": "(I apologize in advance for such a long review, but I had to tell my story) I am almost embarrassed to write this review. However, because I was treated so nicely, I felt compelled to do so. Let me start off by telling the backstory. At his previous job, my roommate used to go to work dinners with vendors, quite often. 3 out of the 4 main places were local steakhouses, and 2 out of the 3 had phenomenal carrot cake. Well, every time he went to one of these establishments, he made sure to bring a piece home to me. Now, all I could remember about the carrot cakes were that they were huge in size and divine tasting. The last time he went, he brought home two slices and they were 3 or 4 layers (I really cannot remember) and it took up the whole container. Well, jump forward to this past Thursday.        My doctor/employer went to a seminar that was held at Morton's Thursday evening. When she told me she was going, I expressed to her how good the carrot cake is. She, in turn, asked if I wanted her to buy me a piece. Of course, I said yes. Friday morning, I went to the office to pick up my piece of carrot cake. It was still in the Morton's bag. I got home, took it out of the bag and noticed this piece was only 1 1/2, almost 2 layers. This was nothing like the pieces I had enjoyed just a few months back. So, I assumed she took half, in order to try it for herself. I did not mind because she bought it. However, today, I asked her about it at the office and she advised me she had not touched the cake and it was just the way it was handed to her. Well, I was outraged, borderline incensed, over this perceived slight on the part of Morton's. It just so happens that I had to run an errand that would take me right past Morton's. So, I told the doctor I was going to stop by there and address this issue with the manager.        Now, on my drive over, I played the scenario in my head stating I would go up to the hostess and ask her how many layers their carrot cake has. If she told me two, I would not bother going any further with this. To my surprise, when I walked through the door, the manager was there at the hostess' stand. So, I proceeded to address my issue with them. The hostess agreed with me that she thought it was 3 layers. She, also, agreed that the piece used to fill the entire container it was placed in. The manager proceeds to go to the kitchen to verify this, at my request. He returns with a fresh piece that looks identical to the piece my doctor had purchased for me. Imagine my horror and embarrassment at realizing this is the size they are now giving out. I wanted to just curl up and die. I was so apologetic to them for the misunderstanding and wasting of their time. I told him the piece was identical to mine and I am not sure of what I was thinking. He offered for me to take the piece but, I declined admonishing him to sell it to another customer. However, he insisted I take it. I graciously did so, apologized once more and exited stage left with my tail between my legs and head held down in complete shame. The manager and hostess were great. She kept reiterating how they believe my story, which made me feel really good because in no way, shape or form was I trying to get over on them. This is why I am sharing my story and giving them 5 STARS (If I could do 6, I would). They deserve it. The food is stellar and, now, I know the customer service is too.",

From seating (they pulled the table out of the booth for us), to wine recommendation, then appetizers - wow.  The server was on TOP of it, gracious and we were very well attended. The manager was extremely friendly and genuinely cared how our event went, and it showed.  I enjoyed every bit of the food, and it was less expensive than I anticipated.  Side note:  I bought a gift card for one of my staff when she got married and she had a good experience here as well - and all this came from a local friend of mines recommendation - will come here every time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Delicious. Absolutely delicious. Morton's is now just barely a few points behind my favorite high-end steak chain, Ruth's Chris.  We came by for my buddy's big 4-OH NO!!! excellent choice for such a grand occassion. located Off Strip, but not too far, this spot is easily accessible. we were actually pretty glad to find out it was a stand alone spot so we didn't have to mess around with all the rigamarole of walking through casinos.   Very classy looking steakhouse. clean and modern but still sensible to all that a steakhouse is. after starting off with an old fashioned and a beer at the bar, we headed off to our table. table side bread and butter started us off by our friendly server. then a dozen oysters for our group of 7. i hate to be cliche and all, but, those oysters tasted sooooo \"fresh\". surprising since we're out in the middle of the desert.   the menu was classic high-end steak house. the steaks ranged from high $30s to triple digit $$$. poultry and seafood were also offered. side items were obviously charged separate. the potates and veggies ranged from $8 to $20. they also offered surf and turf combo specials for $50. not bad for this place. oh, and we got a couple bottles of J Lohr Cab for the table. don't ask how much these $18 bottles cost at this spot.   I ordered the 22oz Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye for $57, medium. Mama ended up having the Salmon and Shrimp. mama did give me some of her seafood, but, i couldn't honestly tell you how it was since all i CAN remember was my beautiful steak. oh, my beautiful steak.... (pause to reflect)   juicy. tender. flavorful. buttery. rich. heavenly. scrumptious. foodgasmic. nom nom.  i'm out of words to describe it. i'm not going to try. you have to get your own and then break out the thesaurus.   we closed off with the obligatory and apparently famous, Mortons' Molton Lava Cake and Ice Cream. man. can i re-use those adjectives for that? not a good thing to have to split two servings of that between a chocolate whore (me) and everyone else. excellent way to finish dinner.   the meal was just amazing. the company even more so. if we have a chance and/or resources to drop a couple (or three) benjamins for a dinner in Vegas again, we may just return.",

The manager even offered a free dessert for the occasion.  I have been to mortons before on the east coast but this place is top notch . For Appetizer we went with the shrimp cocktail. The presentation was so cool and the shrimps were great served with their own special cocktail sauce . We shared our entrees . Cajun ribeye was full of flavor and spice but was not hot at all , definitely one of the best steaks I ever had . We also had the mix grill that they offer with 3 different combinations. We chose the bacon wrapped scallops , crab cake & grilled shrimp. A great dish and we had sour cream mashed potatoes on the side . For dessert we finished our night off with the molten chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking to go out for a top notch steak house while in vegas. I know my next trip to vegas will include a night at mortons.",

    "text": "This is an excellent place to go on special occasions or birthdays!  I made a reservation and the waitress asked if it was for a special occasion so they can customize their menu.  I thought that was very nice of them to do.    Came in, the place was very dim, but that's how most intimate places are anyways.  There were many places to sit, so there was no wait, and we were seating right away.  We started with a glass of Merlot, escargots, and dinner came with onion bread and butter on the table.  The onion bread with onion flakes were not my favorite, but still good.  Escargots were swimming in butter sauce.  Small piece of puff pastry sits on top of each escargot.    We ordered the 16oz cajun (blackened) ribeye and decided to split it since we figured 8oz would be enough.   Pairing ribeye with the Merlot was a great idea!  The Merlot tastes sweeter after tasting the ribeye.  I thought the steak was a bit on the salty side, but still good.  I ordered medium rare, and juicy medium rare was what I got!    For dessert we ordered some port.  Our server came out with some complimentary bread pudding, ice cream, and a candle for the birthday celebrant.  The bread pudding was amazing.    The hostess asked if we wanted a photo, so she took a photo of us, printed the photo, but it in a paper frame with (Happy Birthday), and handed it to us.  At most places this costs money, but not here!  When I got the bill, I noticed that they took 25% \"special occasion\" discount. WOW!  How many places do that?  All the reasons why you should celebrate your special occasion with your significant other here!",

The room was elegant and spacious and featured one long dining table. At the end of the room was a display table which was perfect for the two-tiered birthday cake.  The menu was pre-arranged with specific main course items to choose and side dishes for the group to share. I chose the Double Cut Filet Mignon, medium rare. The steak was huge! A tad overdone, but it was easy to overlook based on the flavor and tenderness. The sides: Steamed Jumbo Asparagus, Lyonnaise Potatoes, Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes, Bacon and Onion Macaroni & Cheese, and Bernaise Sauce. All done really well and importantly, delicious! Everything about the meal was decadent. It was difficult to finish the steak (the double cut isn't messing around), let alone eat more than just a spoonful of each of the sides.  Service was phenomenal and the dinner ran smoothly. I can imagine that if they can organize and successfully execute a 20-person party, a regular dinner for two would be a breeze. It's been a while since my visit, but this is definitely one of the better steakhouses in the city.",

I had the 8oz Lobster Tail, and my husband had the Porterhouse. We got our picture taken. We had a wonderful dessert, it was a chocolate souffle. Our first time trying it :D very good. Thank you for making our anniversary so perfect...",

We told him it was our first time at Morton's and he explained the menu to us very patient. The food was absolutely wonderful very tasty. Our stakes were cooked just how we asked which was very good. I can't rave any more about how amazing Justin was I'm sure he is one of the best there.",

The next day or so I was contacted by Diana and asked if we would like to use the a private dining room.  Diana made all the arrangements and customized the menu.  Upon our arrival, we were taken to a very nice private dining room in the back of the restaurant.  It was set up perfectly.  Our server, Trevor, was right there to take our drink order while we waited for a few more to arrive.  Trevor was excellent in explaining the menu and specials to us.  For some of our party, it was their first time at Morton's and they had a few questions.    We ordered more food than I care to write about.  Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted great.  None of us were disappointed with anything we ordered.  After this dining experience, Morton's will be one of our must do stops for our trips to Las Vegas.",

You're a steakhouse and wondering why you cannot compete with strip steakhouses. What tourist is going to go drive here for a $66 bone in ribeye that is well over cooked and bad quality. Sent it back to have a new one prepared and they did the same thing again. The horseradish mashed potatoes had no flavoring to them. The shrimp cocktail was great though. 6 people at for $660 and we're very disappointed. I will be happy to see this place close just like Roy's up the street that is now Lotus of Siam and a far better option.",

Service from being greeted at the door to the wait staff and host/ess stand all friendly, efficient and excellent. My mixed grill of the filet, shrimp and bacon enclosed scallops was brought out promptly after finishing the delicious escargot with puffed patty bread coverings. While the filet and scallops were succulent, regretfully the shrimp was overdone and as a result a bit rubbery as a result. Finishing the meal of with a Taylor port made up for it though. Consistent with other Morton's it's a place I'd return.",

The crab cakes, salad, and even the bread comes with the meal are all great, but the pricy main course is a big, big disappointment ( they cost $59 each). We all ask the steak to be medium, but 3 out of 4 steaks are all over cooked. They were cooked as medium well, it's very dry and just not tasty. I politely told the waiter about this, and he said he will inform the manager. But until we leave, they did not come back to the table to try to understand the problem. In fact, they did not do anything, as if everything is just fine and we don't even exist. We paid a $333 check plus 15% tips and felt cheated and not worth it at all. Overall this is a very bad experience. I know this is just an unusual incident, but the way they treated the customers is just not professional and not acceptable.",

    "text": "We decided to have our dinner here since this is the nearest place from our hotel. My first time at Morton's gives me a good impression upon entering the Restaurant. Very nice ambience, the reception will get you seated right away and no long wait for your server to come take your order. Everything we've order is so tasty and delicious. Very satisfying dinner. Oh my God, I even forgot ny mame for a moment :-)!!!!!!! The only reason I'm giving it three star is because we were offered a membership card for $25 but you get the $25 dollar points back to your card plus another 25 from dinning that night so it's a total of $50 points and you can redeem to over 500 location in 37 state. Although the server explained it to us that it is non expirable points but he did not explain that we need to register within 24 hours. I only found out when I am on my 4th day in Vegas and tried to register and download their apps and the points in no longer there!!!!!! I sent an email twice but no hope. The next day I found the brochure that comes with the membership card and it says  \"register is within 24 hours\" My recommendation to all the tourist to do not buy a membership card especially when you are a  tourist. Obviously you have no time to read the terms and condition for any offers because of your busy schedule going all over the tourist spot. You will just definitely rely what ever the server explains to you and if there's a missing information then it's a lost in your part! I am still coming back at Morton's if I'm in town mainly only for their food! A bit disappointed!",

My son and I ordered the 12 oz filet and twin lobster tails to split, last visit the lobster was on point and delicious. This time it was a little odd tasting and mealy, and was difficult to cut. Certainly not up to par for such an exclusive restaurant. Otherwise our guests had the 42 oz porterhouse which they said was delicious and our 12 oz filet was excellent as always. My wife had one of the two chicken dishes on the menu she said it was tough we should have sent it back but we didn't. I ordered a couple of the side dishes including baked potato and they were all excellent. I suggest if you come here have a steak because that's what they excel at.",

Not being one to load on protein, the filet trio from the bar menu, a side of grilled asparagus and glass of red is just perfect portions.  Our order is perfectly cooked to temperature requested.  The balsamic glaze on the asparagus is just enough to play with and not against the food.  We've tried other items on the bar menu including the garlic fries and crab, artichoke, spinach dip.  I give both items 5 stars, my benchmark being east coast boardwalk fries and crab dip.  Authenticity gets upgraded by the chef at Morton's.    The atmosphere is True steakhouse, dark and loungy.  A nice respite from the super hot summer outside.  See you there!",

The meat was dry and stringy, very low quality. The bacon onion sprouts side was pretty good. When it came to dessert time, we got the malten chocolate cake, which was one of the worst I had in my life. The cake tasted powdery and overly dry, the fudge in the center was overly sweet and tasted worse then the hersey fudge from the grocery store.   The service was attentive, which is the only thing preventing me for giving a 1 star review. The meal came out to $168 before tips, which is a rip off considering what we got.

I've been to plenty of Morton's Anaheim, Beverly Hills, Santa Ana, downtown LA I've even tried the New York location but this is by far the BEST location I've been to.   Service: where do I start, when paying a nice amount of money you expect a great level of service. From the host to the bartenders while waiting to get seating to our waiter and the manager there is great management here and you can tell by the way the employees work. EVERYONE including the manager were on top of all their guest. There was someone constantly refilling our drinks without asking which made this experience even better. Something so simple yet not a lot of restaurants master it. Our waiter was pleasant and polite. The manager was very professional and the whole staff was managed very well.  Food: this last Thursday we went to Mastros it wast first time and coming here tonight made me realize why I'm so loyal to Morton's! We ordered a filet mignon with the Alexander jumbo shrimp, for the sides we ordered the masked potatoes and the macaroni and cheese. We started our meal with some amazing bread and moved on to the chopped spinach salad and last but not least... The chocolate lava cake.... To DIE for!  Kudos to this amazing restaurant! Amazing chefs and employees!",

    "text": "The best part about our visit to this Morton's was our waitress, Karen.  She was great, had super suggestions and even let us in on a few secrets on how/what to order.  Normally, we LOVE Morton's!  This one was a bit disappointing.  The lettuce was a bit wilted, the hash browns too crisp and my fillet that I ordered medium rare came out medium and a bit burnt.  The veggies were great and we were too full for dessert, so we took it home.  I would suggest ordering your steak a bit under what you normally eat.  My wife ordered hers medium rare too and it was closer, but still not the normal Morton's excellence.  The place was only about half-full on a Friday night, so a \"too-busy\" cook or kitchen cannot be blamed.  Probably many other better steaks to be had in Vegas.",

    "text": "Girls pampering trip to Vegas started with Morton's this past weekend.   For $90.00 per person I was very disappointed!  The steak was very good but everything else was nothing to write home about.  The service wasn't great and I was actually surprised at how the staff wasn't more engaging.  Our reservations were for 6:30pm so they weren't busy yet.  The waiter seemed a little put out that we didn't order drinks. But even the water server was looking behind us when pouring our water. We did have the manager ask how our steaks were and he was the only one that seemed truly engaging.  The waiter became friendlier towards the end which I'm sure was for his tip.  We went for our car and I asked the Valet for change of a $20.  He went in to the bar and came out with 4 $5 dollar bills and said they didn't have change smaller than a $5.  I felt that most of the staff was nice only when they had to be.  I found them to be quite arrogant and entitled.  Needless to say I ended up sick before we even got back to the hotel and spent the next 2 hours ill.  After reflecting on it all weekend I realized that what bothered me so much was I had never felt so invisible.  And how crazy it was that it came from people who's primary job it was to serve us. So sorry I tipped 25%.",

    "text": "We ordered a filet mignon and it had no flavor at all. I mean zero, no salt , pepper, nothing. When I go to an expensive steakhouse with a 1000 degree steak oven/grill, I expect a crunchy seared outside with a soft tender inside - which is something I can not get at home with my GE oven. Well my home cooked steak was a thousand times better and more flavorful. Also, ordered the halibut and it was dry, no flavor and not worth the price. It must have been frozen. When asked how I liked the meal, I was honest and told them it was not good. The server was very good and they offered us free desert,  etc. but that's not what  we were looking for.  We just wanted a great meal and never got it. Also, ordered truffle fries and they brought regular fries and charged $13.00. Vegas has so many better steak places and I will never go here again.",

Lobster bisque was an amazing starter and had by all, but main courses were a major disappointment.   Steaks were ordered med well and came out med rare.  Tender and tasty, but not prepared to our liking. Bacon wrapped scallops undercooked, tasted very fishy and registered complaint.  The waiter apologized three times and made a point to say this was only the second complaint re: scallops in over two years. Don't they teach you to just let it go after one apology? Bacon mac and cheese was poor and tasted grainy like it was rolled in desert sand. Twice baked aug potatoes were excellent.  Credit was applied for scallops on bill but noted \"did not like\" for the reason credit given on the check. Dessert was skipped for obvious reasons, but should have been offered as a make good in my book. Going to save the money and go to Applebees next time...",

We had it all, Wine, drinks, steak, seafood, and even a vegatarian.  And nobody had any problems, issues or complaints.    Service was good and attentive.  My bone in ribeye was cooked perfectly (proper med-rare)  The oyster rockafellers was made well and the asparagus spears were huge but still tender and not over cooked.  I was even a bit impressed with the vegetarian plate.   Now we are in a steak house but they have this monster vegetarian plate that I would almost order it if they didn't have steak!  a couple people got dessert and they all looked really good.  The souffles were light, airy and nobody could say bad about them.  why 4 stars?  cause while everything was really well made there just wasn't that thing that made you go.. OH YEAH..  The steak was GREAT and cooked perfect... but wasn't the best I've had.  Hard pressed to pick the things... but these are 4 solid stars.  Ill be back here and hopefully can figure out why I just cant bring the the 5 star yet!",

    "text": "My wife and I tried Morton's for our anniversary. They impressed us with the small touches, like printing \"happy 5th anniversary\" on our menus, taking our picture, printing and (cardboard) framing it with the date on it and giving it to us for free, and the friendliness and service was excellent. And of course the food was top notch. Best Caesar salad I've ever had, and though it may not have been my favorite filet mingon, it was perfectly cooked and was still great. The shrimp were monstrous and the stuffing made them even better. We tend to go to pricey, upscale spots on the strip when we celebrate occasions, and the food at Morton's not only compared to our favorite places, but our bill was about 75% of what we would have expected it to be for the quality we received. They were out of the dessert wine we chose, and the alternative wine was given to us for free. I highly recommend Morton's for people who would like an equivalent 5 star Vegas strip experience but spend less money.",

All thought everything is Ala Carte they have a great steak and seafood special we always get that is $55 and you get a seafood app, fillet, side, and desert and they will basically substitute anything and for $10 more you can get a bigger and/or different cut.  Make sure to try the chocolate souffle it is the best i've had anywhere hands down!  We will even have dinner at another restaurant and after dinner go to Morton's just for the souffle and a nightcap.",

    "text": "I have to say that my experience at this restaurant was absolutely amazing!  My husband and I went there to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. When I called to make our dinner reservations, the lady on the phone asked if this was a special occasion. I told her it was our wedding anniversary. When we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess was very welcoming and friendly. When he escorted us to the table, he actually pulled out the table so we didn't have to slide into the booth. This had never been done for us at a restaurant before.  When he handed us the paper menus, I noticed right away that typed at the top of the menu was a \"Happy 1st Anniversary Mr. and Mrs. Lara\"  When I saw this, I thought this was so cute and thoughtful for them to acknowledge our anniversary.  The hostess also came by and took our picture and then put it in a nice Morton's paper frame.  Our waiter, Kenneth, was also very very nice. He was so attentive to our needs and very friendly and personable. He explained the menu very well and was able to answer all the questions we had.  Our water and drinks were always refilled. We didn't have to ask for anything. Our waiter always checked on us to see if we needed anything. I got the Cajun Ribeye steak and it was the best steak I have ever had. I definitely recommend it to everyone! It was so juicy and tender and melted in your mouth. We also got the spinach and mushrooms and the sour cream mashed potatoes as sides which were also to die for. After the meal, we got to choose the flavor of our souflee dessert. It was very light and so delicious. This dinner was a little pricey, but worth it every penny for special occasions. I loved this restaurant !!!",

    "text": "So we took our buddy here as a \"going away dinner\". He got married. So it was bittersweet... for him. Good dinner, but you're getting married dude. Sorry. As for us single guys... We paid and enjoyed a fine meal to send our buddy off.  I started off with the Morton's salad, which was a salad at best. Nothing spectacular or outta the ordinary. The anchovy in the salad did make it just a lil'  better, just a lil'.   As for the main course: IT WAS BONER INDUCING. I'm talkin' \"Hugh Hef needin' mad Viaga Status\".  Crab cakes were on the menu so I said, \"garcon, crab cakes por favor\"... These \"cakes\" were nothing but crab. No cake what so ever! Usually it's the other way around where it's nothing but \"CAKE\", herbs and spices. But damn, these \"cakes\" were crab overload! They were served with an aioli on the side but that did not enhance the crab. Just a squeeze o' lemon and it was sexy time!  Again my eyes saw Double Cut Filet Mignon. So I said, \"garcon, double cut phil-ette mig-non\".   I'm not a big fan of filet but I was compelled to order it. I like my steak on the rare side of medium rare. It was cooked just the way I Iikes it . I was in steak nirvana. I cut thin slices and I was thinking, \"should I put some in my shirt pocket for later?\"  No later. I ravaged that cut.   Dessert is not my thing... However, my friend was going to get married and it would have been an odd thing not to order when everyone else was doing it too. Damn peer pressure. LEGENDARY CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!!! I was freakin' speechless! They should make a movie outta this cake with merchandise and all.  We painted the town red that week and did some mad damage.

I had to reorder two drinks as they didn't taste right.  Once seated, we had a great time sharing the plates of the various appetizers.  I ordered the 16 Oz. Australian lobster tail and it was amazing.  It was literally the best that I've eaten in my life.  I highly recommend trying it.  We had great service and the food was prepared perfectly.  The only downside I would say was the alcohol.  I ordered a long island and I never had a buzz.  It had been clearly watered down.  Overall it was a great meal and service.",
