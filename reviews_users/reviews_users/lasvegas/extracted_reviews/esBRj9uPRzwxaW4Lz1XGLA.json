    "text": "Our favey oyster bar for oysters. (Not pan roast but def oysters) our first visit we ended up getting 30 oysters (we usually get a dozen and that's it) but the oysters Royale with the creme freche and wasabi caviar were awesome! So we kept ordering more and more. Bartender is great and service from staff is great. Clam chowder also awesome. Pan roast was good but a little on the sweet side and not creamy like we are used to. We will call it a healthy version. But a tomato butter cream sauce isn't meant to be healthy haha. Great place!",

Once seated at the bar, it took some time before anyone walking around stopped to give us any attention. We ordered a dozen oysters and the pan roast. The oysters appeared fresh and were nice and cold. The pan roast was ok, not as tasty as the pan roast served at the Oyster Bar at Palace Station. Not sure if service was lagging because we got there about 40 minutes before closing, but the server just didn't seem interested in their job and we ended up giving up on ordering another drink during the meal.  If you're looking for an Oyster Bar, try the one at Palace Station. This one doesn't seem quite up to par.",

The horseradish has to be the hottest I have ever tried, but good! Recommend the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and the jambalaya finished it off!  Can't forget the bloody Mary oyster shooters....heaven!  I like the fact that if you are at the bar, your waiter is also your assigned chef.   I highly recommend this place if you are ever in Vegas!!!",

    "text": "We entrusted the help of our fellow yelpers for a good place to eat before going to our show. We turned our sights on the Oyster Bar and unfortunately, it did not live up to the expectation we had set for it.  Luckily for us, we were looking for something light, but we didn't expect having something light would compromise for taste. We ordered two dozen oysters, one served on the half shell ($20) and the Royale ($29) which had caviar and some creme on it. They both came out considerably small (take note of the photos) and the sad part was if you closed your eyes, you would not be able to tell the difference between the two. Til this day, I still don't know what the fuss is over caviar. Anyhow, the oysters were not only small, but lacked in flavor. I was clearly disappointed because I knew I could get about twice as many oysters at my local crawfish house. Sadness.   At least the crab cakes did not disappoint. They were light, crisp, and slightly oily but not bad at all. The sauce accompanied with it was great, but even with that being said, I can't overlook the fact that this oyster bar didn't have good oysters!  It isn't the best place to hang out at either. Your view is basically the casino floor and a small bar area with a display of ice and oysters on them.   Too bad we looked forward to something all weekend that ended up being a huge let down =(",

I had a feeling it wouldn't be up to par with the original.  It had a lot of seafood, but the consistency was very watery and a bit too sweet.  I got the calamari, which had way too much breading on it and was on the salty side.  My other friend got the linguini w/ clams, which was not a very large portion considering the near $20 price (more or less).  There's no wait but skip the Pan Roast here!",

When the sea bass is available, he loves that too. You need a pretty big appetite to finish the pan roast.  I will order the oysters (well done), and the blackened sea scallops on linguine.

The menu selection was much smaller than the other Oyster Bar, but they had a few similar items so we figured it would still work. At first, the server was very friendly and attentive. He got our drink orders right away and suggested a few items on the menu to help us decide what to order. My dad ordered the cioppino, my sister & sales guy got the recommended shrimp scampi, brother in law the fish and chips, and I had the Cajun scallops over pasta. The cioppino was cold, which is odd since all the seafood in it was overcooked. The shrimp scampi was super bland so the two people who ordered it were dumping salt and Tabasco on it just to make sure their taste buds were still working. My scallops were seasoned well, but all caked and burnt on one side. The pasta part of my dish was super bland too so I had to scrape the seasoning off of my scallops to mix in to get some type of flavor. I think the fish and chips were ok, so that makes it the best dish of the night. When the server came by, I told him that all the food was super bland and he just said \"bland? ok\" then cleaned it up and gave us the bill. In terms of price, it was pretty expensive too. Mid $20 - mid $30 range but you save $1 with the Total Rewards card. LOL. What a joke.",

Our waiter Dominick said that we had to come back the next day to get their bloody marys and oyster shooters...we said \"why the hell not\" and ordered their oyster shooters with Patron. Holy crap. I was expecting an ounce of Patron with an oyster...no. We got 3 OUNCES of Patron with an oyster. He also made a Caesar and gave me a little bit of the leftover.

    "text": "My friends and I had stayed at Harrah's for Memorial Day weekend and kept seeing posters of this oyster bar.  One of the girls and I are crazy about oysters so we decided to check this place out.  The host/waiter (I didn't get his name) was extremely nice.  He was very friendly, helpful, and provided great service.  My friend and I ordered a half dozen of the Oysters Royale (raw) and half dozen of the Oyster Rockefeller (baked).  Both dishes were really good although I liked the Oysters Royale more because of both the caviar and oysters freshness.  Although it is a bit pricey ($30 for both dishes), it was well worth it.",

I prefer the regular oyster on the half shelf instead of the Royale which is topped with caviar and creme fraiche (too heavy and completely covered the fresh flavor of oyster.) I thought the shooters were fun but taste was mediocre.  Bouillabaisse is delish, lobster, scallop, clam, mussel, prawn, and grilled fish all in a saffron broth.. how can you go wrong with that!! Fried calamari is sooo good too! with a lemon/garlic aioli sauce.  All the pasta dishes are all cooked to perfection. Clam chowder is also so freaking good.. Okay you know what, everything on the menu is good!!! Oh and the portion size here is huge!   Freshest seafood plus a glass of pinot grigio.. ahh. i'm in heaven..",

We ordered a dozen oysters and got another dozen of our favorite of the two they had (Fannie Bay, I think - nice and briny).  The waiter paired the oysters with some excellent wine.  Finally we got another 1/2 dozen of the other (more mild) and finished everything off with the wonderful bread pudding.  All of this for $80!  It was awesome to sit right next to where the chef was shucking the oysters.  Also the horseradish that they served with the oysters is super freshly grated!  It was awesome!  Just watch out how much you put on because it can get really spicy.  This was one of my most favorite meals while I was in Vegas.  And I will be going back to this place again!",

The fried ones were more batter and flour than oyster, so I would stay away from those if given a choice between the three.   There's not much to be said of the ambiance. It's too bad, because the oysters are SO GOOD. This place would probably be busier if it weren't a Monday night at 4:30pm. And if it weren't at Harrah's.",

I must say, this place had the freshest oysters I've had.  It was sooooo good.  We also had the crab and shrimp and seafood cocktail for our appetizers along with cups of their New England clam chowder.  We were in seafood heaven!    The entire party enjoyed all their entrees which consisted of grilled halibut, seafood jambalaya, blackened scallop fettucine, langostine salad w/ house dressing to name a few.    Our server was absolutely fabulous and had a great sense of humor.  Great turn-out for my parents' 30th anniversary dinner.  I would definitely come back here on our next trip.",

The waiter said they had two types of oysters and for some reason \"Asian people\" like the \"Fanny Bay Oysters\" compared to the \"Blue Point Oysters.\"  I then proceed to ask him why he said \"Fanny Bay has a fishier taste to it.\"  I ordered the \"Fanny Bay Oysters\" and I'm glad I did.    Things you should expect:  Don't expect a 5 star oyster bar.  It's a laid back oyster bar and the only thing we recommend are the following:  -Clam Chowder : Rich and creamy filled with clams. -Steamed Little Neck Clams: The broth is buttery and has herbs -Oysters:  You're not going to get full off of them so order a dozen per person. -Calamari:  Make sure to ask them to do it WELL DONE or EXTRA Crispy.  They are the best when they are extra done.  If you don't tell them that they'll come out a little soft.  If you want a quick fix JUST for oyster and a snack come here to eat or grab a bite.  Don't come here looking for a 5 star feast.",

    "text": "I was a bit disappointed by this place. My friend loved the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station and highly raved about the pan roast. He said they waited almost an hour to get a seat there at 1AM! So I decided to check this place out with him, and although this location is a lot bigger, there was hardly anyone at prime lunch time. We sat ourselves at the bar. There was an empty glass with used up lime just lying around, but we assumed someone will take care of it once we sat down.  Nope. Not the case at all. There was only one guy taking orders AND cooking. He saw us but didn't acknowledge us for the longest time. We had to flag down another waitress, who gave us water but had to call that guy over to take our order. We decided to share a bowl of clam chowder and the much-talked-about pan roast. And so he rings it up and gives us plates and utensils. My knife was super dirty. It still had dried up food remains on it.... gross.   We watched this guy cook while chatting with other customers, as well as bussing. Overall, it just seemed very unsanitary, the way he was throwing plates in the sink and not washing his hands before going back to cook.   We got the bread basket. Butter was super bland (I don't know how that's possible), so I dipped it into the clam chowder. The soup was very rich and creamy, which I did like. It was actually one of the better clam chowders I've had in a while.   The pan roast was... not the same pan roast as my friend got at the other location. Apparently, this was the \"everything\" pan roast, with all kinds of seafood stacked to one side, a scoop of rice to the other side, all soaked in a tomato-y sauce. The presentation was pretty sloppy. Yelp the other Oyster Bar and you'll see the photos look totally different. Although I did like a lot of the seafood in this pan roast, my friend said the other one was more flavorful. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. It just wasn't amazing. Boo to my friend who overhyped it haha.",

The seafood bar was wide open and had perfect seating   in front of a flat screen.   The male waiter who was taking care of some tables also gave me a menu. Don't expect any happy hour or drink specials here and expect to pay $7.00 for a bottle of beer since you're on the strip. I ordered the cold seafood platter which had half a lobster tail, 4 mussels, 4 oysters and four prawns. As for the taste and quality I'll just say I've experienced better especially for what they charge. Most of the seafood with the exception of the prawns were bland, dry amd juiceless.  The service by the waiter was non existent and getting bread,  water and the bill was like pulling teeth. I'm not sure if because it was July 5th and the guy was burnt out or what but next  time do the customers a favor and call in sick. I must give credit to the waiter behind the seafood bar- he was spot on and on his game, unfortunately we got stuck with bozzo the clown. I tipped accordingly!  I can say that based on this experience I wouldn't give this place another opportunity, especially since there are so many legitimate establishments in Las Vegas that appreciate and want to earn your business.",

The service is good. Our waiter 'Moon' was very nice and attentive.   My review of the food...in one word, just okay. I ordered the shrimp Caesar salad, my husband had the lobster bisque and we had a dozen GRILLED oysters. My shrimp were a little over cooked and there was way too much dressing on my salad. My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque, but as for the grilled oysters...they weren't actually grilled at all. It looked as if someone shucked them, sat them on the grill for about 3 minutes and then brought them to us. The cheese wasn't all the way melted, the oysters was still very raw (which my husband did not like) and it just wasn't what a grilled oyster looks like at all!   Side Note: At one point the drink waiter got tired of our waiter 'Moon' asking him to refill our drinks (we only had one refill) so he filled a tea kettle with Sprite and left it on our table!!!!!!!!!! He said, \"So we could refill it ourselves.\"   Would I go back? Yeah, I would give it another try but I would order just the raw oysters and other items completely different than what we had!",

However, it's not the most attentive or qualitative: takes a bit to be seated, drinks are smacked down in front. The person serving us was kinda like \"what do you want?\" and did the same to the older gentleman next to us.  The food was average. Free bread and butter with your meal: the bread was a little overdone but good still, the butter was plain, NOT the more flavourful honey butter.   We all ordered the clam chowder with the bread bowl: chowder was good, veggies and clam were noticeably tasty, bread was toasted well. However it was 25% chowder and 75%. The bread bowl wasn't dug out completely. So you're pretty much paying $13 bucks for bread.   Overall, average service, average meal, but 2 stars for the scamming my chowder and the tobacco-filled atmosphere",

Poor us. Perhaps it was \"The B Team\" Friday night before Super Bowl, and all the expert crew that allegedly occupy the space behind the bar opening oysters were away for the night? Perhaps not. You are self-described \"Oyster Bar.\" You feature \"Oyster\" in your restaurant name. We came for your featured product. You barbarians are vulgarians who demonstrate absolutely no knowledge of the bivalve. We ordered a couple dozen on the half-shell, raw. Now then, since you guys are clearly unfamiliar with presentation, let me help.  First, you open them. Bravo: you did this part!! Next, you detach the contents from the bottom part of the shell, so that your patron can \"slurp\" the oyster. You failed at that part: you left us all to use our own forks to scrape & detach each mollusk from its lower home.  That is amateurish, and because of it, you suck at what you do. If only it had all ended there. It is clear that after opening, some dumb handler ran each freshly opened oyster under flowing water, presumably to remove residual shell, no doubt the result from amateur opening.  Here's the deal, Amateur: you thereby remove all the \"liquor\" from the oyster, and sap the mollusk of its oceanic flavor. A True purveyor of oysters (e.g., Hog Island) uses the opening knife to fleck off residual shell, and is deliberate in preserving the liquor. What arrived to our table as a result was a piece of effectively cold, flavorless protein with a familiar chew.  And \"only\" at a cost of $33/dozen!! As a routine visitor for 20 years, the Vegas Strip has devolved into an overpriced venue for screwing one-time, out-of-town visitors who may be as impressed with bright lights as the basic handling of culinary product.  Sad.  Dupes will continue to stream here, as we did, on the basis of Yelp reviews by the legion of young people with far more dollars than sense to whom Vegas now exclusively caters. If you know & love oysters, stay the absolute hell away from this miserable place that does dishonor to the King of Shellfish. Just. Stay. Away.",

My intention was to get something light to hold me over till dinner, but I saw the menu and just ordered the first thing that sounded good to me. I told myself I wouldn't eat it all so I wouldn't be too full for dinner. I had a pasta that was pretty good with grilled chicken, andouille sausage, and ham. The Pasta was ok and the portion was really large. I tried hard not to eat too much but didn't do a good job at that. If I come back I'll try the oysters.",

The drink consist of skyy ginger vodka mixed with muddled mint and blueberries on the rocks. It was pretty tasty and also reminded me of one my favorite drinks.   The waitress brought over a bowl of hot rolls and crispy sesame toast. Both were pretty good. The sesame toast was crisp like a chip with a slight buttery garlic flavor.   I ordered the crab cakes from the appetizer menu. It was seasoned lump crab meat garnished with field greens and red pepper aioli. It was the perfect portion for me to subside the hunger I was feeling and still have room for dinner later.   I enjoyed my meal and my waitress was great!",

While up in my room, I decided to go downstairs and see what Harrah's had to offer, and hoped they would not be as ridiculously overpriced as most hotel restaurants are (because they know I have no choice).   So the first place I see is the oyster bar and I am sold. You don't have to say oysters twice in order for this fish to bite. I love raw oysters. So I sat down at the bar and opened a menu. The bar seats a handful and there are a few high tables scattered around. No wait or line. I ordered a dozen oysters to myself because I'm crazy like that. I also ordered the jambalaya which was a pretty hearty portion. My co-worker ordered the salad with the shrimp on it and it looked delicious. Everything was cooked well and flavorful. The oysters were kept on a large mound of ice in the middle and was shucked to order. They have several types of oysters and price varies depending on which one you choose. It tasted fresh. The jambalaya was even good the day after as leftovers. The only complaint would be the price but that's average at a hotel/casino where dining is usually overpriced anyways. I would return.",

Oysters that are arranged immaculately in their half shell by the dozen on a clean plate displaying their luscious-naked-selves in preparation for your partaking. Since my caveman days in Vegas, I have frequented this spot to get a little extra oyster fix due to the freshness and quality as well as varieties offered here. Not to mention, it was CHEAP enough to overindulge.  But time always seems to dull the glimmer of any establishment in Vegas. At the very least, you will always eventually begin to notice some form of gradual decline like the dents and scratches that appear on a once-new car. This oyster bar is no different. If I was to review a few years ago, Harrah's Oyster Bar would have received a raving 5-star review. Now, it sits merely on a 3.5-star bar stool (instead of a throne) and has lost its luster like I would say of spots at ol'Vegas. (Packed but having an absence of a LONG queue).  The oysters are still okay but for some bloody unknown reason, the shucking has become a lot clumsier in the last year as I find more bits of shell in the oysters as I down each half shell. This just ruins the overall oyster consuming experience for me. Perhaps, they're having a bad day OR the oysters decided to go on strike together with the oyster union and extending their crap to the \"taxpayers\".  The Cioppino and the Bouillabaisse, which act as my main course after downing all those oysters, have also lost its mind-blowing flavor. I can only pout now and visit this establishment more as a continued habit than as a personal food preference.  Service still remains close to stellar and I have always been treated like royalty.

Relatively inexpensive compared to most seafood joints on the Strip, Oyster Bar at the Harrah's offers decent food in a bar like atmosphere. It's literally a circular shaped establishment. A bar with seats around it and a few belly tables surrounds the outer corners. There isn't much walking space at all.  Forget about the salads and the entrees! I think the calamari is the best darn thing on the menu. The batter is super flavorful so you don't really need to use the dipping sauce. All you need is a squirt of citrus-yum, my mouth is salivating at the thought of it! Since it's an Oyster Bar, def try something in their Oyster section. For those who don't like raw seafood,  I highly recommend the Bouillabaisse and Cioppino. My mom likes those two dishes a lot.",

The prices are pretty steep. a dozen oysters after tax/tip is about $30. Might as well go to a buffet and enjoy all the other seafood choices and pay a bit more.   Service was a bit slow as previous people have written. Nothing too horrible - but just noticed a  lack of attention as the meal went on and very slow to finish out the payment process.  For 2 people, ordered 2 drinks, a dozen oysters and the seafood boil pot. Came out close to $100 with tip. Totally not worth it... I know everything in vegas is expensive but to enjoy oysters, go else where.",

    "text": "I love oyster bars. My usual joint is the oyster bar at Sunset Station in Henderson, but I heard about the bar in Harrah's and wanted to give it a try.  Like most places on the strip, it's spendy. For instance, the $15 Crabby Mary was a slightly sweetened and disappointing take on a bloody mary, garnished with just a lime wedge and two olives, served in a pint glass.  We ordered the steamed muscles in garlic butter broth. This dish was really good and better matched to the price, however the bread served with our food was pretty meh. The bread basket included four bread rolls that looked like the basic grocery store twelve roll pull apart variety, and some crispy flat bread that felt stale. The upside to the steamed muscle dish is all that delicious broth to soak up with your bread, and soak we did. When we asked for a second round of bread, we just got 2 of the generic rolls which meant some broth went un-sopped... so sad. All in all, the oyster bar at the Sunset Station is still my favorite in the LV/Henderson area for better prices, no skimping, and better bread.",

He made our pan roast for us fresh and boy did he do a great job!! Two thumbs up!!   We also had the oysters and thought they were alright. The oysters were fresh but very large and plump...we prefer our oysters smaller and brinier. I guess the con won't deter us from enjoying the other wonderful dishes at this place.   Definitely will be back for that pan roast...hopefully we get Ly again!!",

This place is actually a dine-in restaurant, unlike the literal oyster bar at Palace Station.  Luckily for us, they served raw oysters and had them available on a Sunday night.  There was no wait; most of the dining area was empty, but the bar was full.  Although signs said they closed at 10 pm, all the servers and chefs were wrapping up as soon it was 9 pm.  I saw them flip the open sign to closed.  Just a note: I think Harrah's has a different crowd than some of the other hotels on the strip.  The hostess was friendly; servers were attentive with our drinks.  They gave us a complimentary bread basket with butter.  The dinner rolls were ok; the fried bread thing was alright.  I ordered a dozen oysters for $30.  They were really good (or maybe I was just hungry).  I have to say I didn't get food poisoning, which I was afraid of.  They have several sauces on the table, but I only used Tabasco.  I don't think they had options for which kind of oyster to get because the waiter just brought out a platter.    I'm giving them four stars because they were very satisfying.  It's a good place to go if you need raw oysters.",

Why do they ask how many when clearly there are only 2 people standing in front of them? Lol ugh anyway...   We get seated. A few minutes later we get bread. A few minutes later our server Moon comes and gets our drink order. A few minutes later our drinks come and we order raw oysters as an appetizer. They come out a few minutes after that. We eat them. They're good. Then I ordered some potato wedges to hopefully help settle my stomach (helicopter ride right before this).   Basically everything had long delays in between. There was only one other server besides poor Moon. He's a great server though. You'll be lucky to have him.   My guy ordered the Cajun scallops and I ordered the new England steamer I think it was called. His pasta looked a little dry and stuck together. The scallops were a tad overcooked but had good flavor. My dish was very salty but had the best shrimp and mussels I've ever had! The sausage were really lame and the corn on the cob was kinda gross. :/  The best part of our meal was definitely the oysters. I was very hesitant about raw seafood in the desert, but they did not disappoint! The naked cowboy hot sauce was great!   But I'll stick to seafood in Seattle. :D",

Less than $3 a piece so it's not priced too badly. I wish the oysters were more plump though. I felt like the oysters I was given were the runts of the bunch. They were delicious but I do wish they were bigger.  My boyfriend got the seared scallop pasta. SO GOOD. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the pasta was in a really delicious sauce as well. The sauce itself also had little bay scallops in it. If you love scallops, this one is a must try!",

I'm writing this review at a fancy steakhouse in downtown Vegas where a dozen oysters are $29, even cheaper than this casino bar's oysters. The best part about this dish was the extremely spicy horse radish.",

All were really good.   For entrees we ordered fried oysters w/potato wedges and bouillabaisse. Oysters were big, delicious and perfectly cooked. Bouillabaisse was very good. Nice saffron base and tons of seafood. You can add pasta for an addl charge.   We looked around at other orders and portions were massive compared to other places we dined.   Overall - really good food but sitting at the bar was what made it!  If you eat here ONLY sit at the bar. Ly and Trent were fun and made us feel welcome.",

The staff are always very nice so that also makes you want to come back.  Good service is so hard to find anymore.  One of my favorite dishes is the scallops in pasta.  You can ask them to custom your order if you want. They can usual add or subtract anything you want.  Great bar and drink menu too.",

Watch them shuck them right before your eyes (if you're sitting at the bar that is). Tasted so fresh!! Their horseradish was really REALLY good. It's an oyster bar, MUST HAVE. Bowl of Clam Chowder - This clam chowder was AMAZING. I loved how they put a generous amount of clam... they were huge too!! Perfectly chewy and not overpowering at all. I love how I didn't feel bits of sand like other places...! Bloody Mary - HANDS DOWN THE BEST BLOODY MARY I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!! And I've had a CRAPTON! Please try!

I ordered the clam chowder and the calamari to take back to my room which they charged an additional $2 for it being \"to go\". I dont know why i left a tip, i guess i shouldnt have after that unnecessary charge.  The clam chowder was really good though. It had nice big chunks of clams, although it could have used some more potatoes since it was mostly creamy soup.  The deep fried calamari lacked flavor. I wished places would seaon their batter or even the squid. There's no reason it should taste like nothing. The 2 sauces and the lemon helped though, but still, I probably wouldn't order the calamari again.  If im back in vegas, ill stop in for some clam chowder if i get a craving but thats about it.",

It's closer to the strip, too. You can just sit at the bar and watch the open kitchen. The chef himself took our order.   We almost killed ourselves. We split a bowl of the clam chowder, which was incredible. Then came the jumbo shrimp cocktail, which was delicious, and with shrimp as jumbo as they come. Then came O.B.'s Pan Roast, every last drop of which we sopped up with bread, followed by the cioppino (be sure to order it spicy) -- phenomenal. At this point, we were hoping they'd forgotten about them, but no, they had not -- and out came a dozen Oysters Rockefeller as good as you've ever had. You cannot go wrong with this menu.",

Clam chowder was creamy and good but nothing to write about.  Grilled oysters with Parmesan butter was good but the main star was the oysters Rockefeller. They were insanely good. For half dozen it's $29 and the dozen is $40. We got two half dozen at the dozen price. The server was really cool about it.  The jambalaya with chicken was good, but it wasn't their best dish.

There were many things that caught my eye including the large display of oysters on ice, the flat screens showing an NBA game which I had some action on, and a fully stocked bar. But what captured me was the saute station which you don't see at the Stations' Oyster Bars.  The station was in a frenzy and the gentleman manning the station was running at least 7-10 tickets deep. I would typically order something from the steamer section, but I wanted something from saute, so I ordered the pan-seared Scottish salmon ($23). With a great vantage point, I watched my order from the time he pulled the ticket until it the ticket was sold. My man came through. Crispy salty skin, moist flaky, fall apart meat, and firm, seasoned asparagus on the side.  I'll assume the rest of the dishes from the station were executed just as well.  Also ordered were a dozen blue point oysters ($23, they have other varieties if you should choose) and clams with red sauce ($17, pasta is extra). Both were delicious. Service was excellent at the bar. I'll be back to try some of the steamer dishes to compare to our standard. Even though it's a longer haul to the Strip, this place has the potential to take over as our new go to oyster bar.",

And I was happy it did.   My waiter was awesome. He walked me through all of the oysters available.   What I especially liked about him was I asked which was better: the fried calimari or the Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was about 7 bucks cheaper. He said \"get the chowder. You'll love it.\"  I did...and he was correct. It was amazing. Spicy, full of clam meat and veggies and over the top in flavor.   Then I went with the Crab Louis salad and that - as my picture states - is a work of art. An amazing amalgam of flavors and textures loaded with crab meat and avocado and greens.   Great service and outstanding food.",

The dozen oysters of blue point oysters were extremely huge and tasted wholesale.  Oysters = bottom of the barrel, bad shucking. Pico de gallo = tomatoes were not fresh. Asian oyster shooter = tastes funky.  On top of that, the service was horrible! I can see that there was only 1 server working the whole area. The forgotten waters and messed up orders can be forgiven, but an overcharged card can't, especially if the mistake was known.  The split check, half card, half cash, was mishandled. The server, Moon, charged the entire bill on the card and kept all the cash as tip. This wasn't noticed at the time because he reprinted the slip as a different amount that actually showed up on the credit statement. This problem still needs to be fixed!",

I craved the the Original Oyster Bar's Pan Roast, but was given hard to crack crab in what tasted like a mildy spicy PORK N BEANS broth. Such a disappointment. Oysters were good, but only served with cocktail sauce. Clam chowder was too watery for my taste.

He was the only waiter taking care of the entire dining room - serving food, taking orders, billing tables, clearing plates - he's a one-man show!   We were really disappointed with the food.  My boyfriend had been craving pan roast for the longest time. I told him about Palace Station, but he was afraid of the long lines and wait, so we settled on this place.    We ordered O.B.'s Pan Roast and the fish & chips.  The pan roast base was thin and soupy.  Not creamy, not rich, and definitely not decadent.  Although there was plenty of seafood in the meal, everything still had shells on them~  You have to peel your own shrimp, fork out the lobster out the tail, and crack extremely thick crab legs.  The mussels and clams were easy to scoop out.  I felt like I was at Boiling Crab, and needed a plastic bib.  At $38 for one pan roast here, I would rather buy 2 seafood pan roasts at Palace Station for the same price.    The fish and chips were meh.  The chips were nicely seasoned and crispy, but the fish was soggy.  The fish filet was considerably thick, making it difficult eat with your hands because it kept breaking in the tarter sauce when combined with the sogginess of the batter, which didn't hold the fish together.    I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.",

I'm sure they fly it in daily. I always start out with the oysters on the half shell. There are different selections and they let you know what type they are and where they're from. I then always move onto a bowl of their New England Clam Chowder. I must say that it ranks with the best I've ever had.  A lot of their dishes are prepared in steam pots. One of those selections is typically what I go for as my main course. The seafood comes out cooked well and the flavors are great in any of the dishes I've tried. Their meals also come accompanied by a great selection of breads.  When I'm in the mood for a treat and willing to spend the cash, I'll get the chilled seafood sampler. An assortment of yummy goodness sums it up. The price doesn't bother me that much because comparatively to other restaurants on the strip, the prices at the Oyster Bar aren't that bad.  If you're into seafood, this is one of the best options on the strip.",

We sat at the bar table and almost instantly the waitress came and greeted us with iced water with a lemon wedge and buns, which were delicious by the way, we never saw her after that though. A couple of minutes later a cook came by to take our order. The clam chowder came out I a matter of minutes. The clam chowder was truly phenomenal. The texture was amazing and it was rich and full of flavor. We never got tired, or overwhelmed by the taste. The half shell oysters came out six minutes later and we were excited to try them, as the clam chowder was so amazing. Unfortunately the oysters left us disappointed. The were bland of taste and the texture was extremely mucous like. There were lots of small bits of the shell mixed with the oyster itself making the experience very unpleasant. Half the time we were picking out small bits of shell out from between our teeth. Extremely disappointed with this place. One would think that because it is an OYSTER BAR the oysters would be the damn near perfect, but that is unfortunately not the case. The clam chowder on the other hand, 10/10",

Harrods is an oldie but goodie Vegas hotel, don't get swayed that its not the new grand other big named hotels. Get over to Harrods' Oyster Bar. Fantastic!!! I have been coming for years when it wasn't many people, it was just a small bar. This year, surprised to see more tables, and a wait to get seated. Oh My! But well worth it. You have to get a plate of oysters on the half shell, and then....go for it. My parents love the clams in white wine with pasta. I love the choppino. Everything so good. Sit at the bar if you can, and watch these guys work like magic, making the dishes right in front of you",

We sat at the bar and waited close to 20 minutes to place our orders. We got bread and water and just sat there. This was 7:30 on a Sunday night and not very busy but we're told the kitchen needed time to catch up. When the waiter finally came, he kept trying to leave after one of us placed their order and there were 4 of us. We had to keep flagging him down to order oysters and drinks as well as entrees. Once we finally ordered, first they brought us the wrong oysters, then my friend's drink never came. He ordered a dirty martini and when he mentioned it to the waiter halfway through our meal, he got a regular martini. Then our pan roast came. It was watery and way too sweet. Most of the mussels were shriveled and inedible. The crab claws were super hard to crack even with a cracker and the meat inside was dry. We got a pan roast for 2 people and the size was about the same as a pan roast from Palace Station's Oyster Bar but nearly double the price. Now I know why people wait 90+ minutes over there even though it's off the strip. Don't make the same mistake I did.",

This place is not the same oyster bar at palace station, completely different with some of the same and different menu items.  First difference I noticed that there was not long line like the one in the palace station. More tables & more seats at the bar so we were able to seat ourselves. The restaurant is run by one waiter & one bus boy, it works out pretty well considering the size of the place.  Oyster bar means oysters, raw & cooked. I'm not a fan of raw oysters so we got the oysters Rockefeller & fried oysters. The Rockefeller was sooo tasty, the cheese was melted just right on top the oyster, and of course the fried oyster was well... everything tastes better fried.   For entree I got the shrimp jambalaya. It was a generous portion of rice, ham & sausage topped with shrimp. I also got to taste the ciopinno. It was very soupy, no rice included, but a larger portion or seafood.   Overall, I would recommend this place if you're staying on the strip, not as busy as other oyster bars off the strip.   You might have to flag down the waiter a couple times as he scrambles to tend to the entire restaurant, but he doesn't seem to mind!",

The legend of Oyster Bar's pan roast had been locked into my memory for months and seeing that the restaurant was located right outside of my elevator doors, my dining decision was quite simple.   \"I'll order the pan roast for two please.\"  Splitting this with a friend was the most cost efficient move but I think it's safe to say that we were both a little underwhelmed by what we received. Some bite had me liking the sweet broth and others had me hating it, but definitely never loving it. There was a healthy dose of seafood, which included lobster, shrimp, and clams but I also found it more than disappointing that some of the shellfish hadn't opened during the cooking process. No bueno.   Another factor of my meal that has me hovering on the three star rating is that my specialty martini, (that's how it was listed on the menu) was described as having blue cheese stuffed olives. Those who know me know that I'm an absolute sucker for blue cheese stuffed olives so when this drink showed up with your run-of-the-mill pimento stuffed olives I was very let down. Even when asking for the \"problem\" to be fixed I was met with an instant (and prepared/defensive) response of \"we don't have them.\"  Take your money elsewhere... maybe McDonald's?",

After we our flight from San Antonio, we dropped our luggage off and walked over here. I had no idea what to order except oysters on half shell. The Dangs had suggested what to get and I trust them because they have never failed me on food. They're knowledge of food is just on top. Although, there were other locations we came here because this one was closet to walking distance.   On the table there was a rack of 6 different hot sauces... well 4-5 since 2 were duplicates. I had to try one of them and me had to pick the one that said harberno which wasn't as spicy as a I thought. It wasn't bad on my raw oyster.   I ordered a glass of white wine, while they had flat tire beers (I've had this at my favorite bar \"Village Bottle\" back in Hawaii. But I'm not a big fan of beers) We shared one dozen oysters on half shell, basket of fried calamari, and the O.B.'s Pan Roast. My gosh, that thing was delicious!!!!!!! I'm glad I listened to them and just shared. That pan roast was BOMB!!! The cream sauce and the seafood (mussels, lobster, clams, shrimp and crab claws) with rice was like heaven. Orgasm in my mouth. I will definitely go back for this dish! It is worth every penny! Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Dang for bringing me here.",

It was also a generous portion of seafood. We couldn't stop thinking about this meal so on our last night in Vegas we went back. The seafood risotto and my husband had the scallops. Both were very good . The sauce on the risotto was different from the sauce in the pan roast but still very yummy. I did not get pictures of our first meal but here are the pictures from our second meal. Definitely recommend this restaurant when you're in Vegas.",

For oysters, we arrived during HH, which we were unaware of until one of the chefs mentioned it. I think her name was Cory (spelling may be off). They had a couple specialty oysters on ice and she let us try/sample some after we had ordered a dozen of their blue pointe shell friends. I can't remember the names but two were from Washington (one was on promo for Breast Cancer Awareness month) and the other from Canada. The blue pointe's were my favorite. They were solid. Flavor profile and size were on point. After sampling some, we decided to order half a dozen of the ones from WA for BCA. They were a lot saltier and had more of a sea taste to it, more than I liked, but it was tamed down with some lemon juice, tabasco, cocktail sauce and horseradish. The guy who was chucking the oysters was friendly too.  It's located towards the north end of Harrah's casino. The service was great and we enjoyed our pit stop. Definitely recommend!",

    "text": "\"The World is your oyster....\".   Following a fun week in San Antonio, TX, we moved onto Las Vegas.  I had mentioned to our traveling companion our casual dining plans which included a trip to the Oyster Bar (we usually go to the one at Palace Station) on The Strip.  We're fans of these salt water bi-valve molluscs both raw or cooked as well as the Oyster Bar's famed jacketed steam kettles in which the chefs cook your shellfish pan roast in front of your eyes.  The Oyster Bar has 3 very popular locations in Las Vegas (Palace Station, Sunset Station and Harrah's Casino on The Strip).  Because we didn't rent a car and was too lazy to call a ride share, we chose this location.    Fortunately, when we arrived, the Oyster Bar wasn't crowded at all and has a larger seating area than the other 2 locations.  There wasn't even a line as we just walked in and seated ourselves.  Our server quickly came by with beverage and dinner menus.  He gave us a few minutes to browse both menus as he made his way back with tall glasses of iced water.  During our decision making, I noticed their condiment rack of 6 different hot chile sauces which we could use to spice up our food to our liking.   We ordered Fat Tire beers and a red wine (for our companion) then placed our order for a dozen oysters on the half shell ($30), a basket of flash fried calamari ($14) and the famous O.B.'s Pan Roast ($34).  The menu only offered one type of shellfish pan roast whereas at Palace Station or Sunset Station, you're given more selections.  The cost of food at this site is higher than at PS or SS but for convenience sake, it was worth it.  What can I say about the food flavors and portions?  It was as delicious as we remembered at their sister sites.  Our appetizers that we shared were oysters which were plump, lightly briny and fresh tasting and the \"flash fried\" calamari was lightly breaded and had a crisp exterior over tender calamari rings and tentacles.  We must've been hungry because by the time our main meal (O.B.'s Pan Roast) arrived, which wasn't that long of a wait, we \"wiped\" the two appetizer plates clean!   The O.B.'s Pan roast was filled with mussels, lobster, clams, shrimp and crab claws in a luscious smoked tomato cream sauce with a hint of brandy.  A scoop of jasmine rice was plopped atop all of the shellfish goodness.     By the end of the meal, we were raring to go out and make our \"obligatory deposits\" into those slot machines with hopes of hitting the MegaBucks.",

Food, well considering I was trying to have a light lunch. I just kept ordering and ordering.  I think I can honestly say everything is good here.  Oyster connoisseurs can dive into their many different variety of prepared oysters.  If you are feeling naughty go RAW.  They have an oyster happy hour between 2-4pm.  Don't ask the price. Idk, I was just eating away!  I opted for the garlic Parmesan, (not happy hour price) The oysters were from New York and Washington.  They typically have that flavor of really cold and a distinct taste.  OB's Pan Roast, the flavor was so on point.  The tomato base,  well groomed and creamy touch drowning the seafood was the drunken love I'm talking about! Forget Beyonce, I'm stupid drunk over here off of some seafood! I hope I leave my waistline in Vegas..Man shoot! Too good!",

I couldn't necessarily discern the freshness or flavor from any other good oyster. I'm guessing it was average/good to everyone else, but not standout for an \"oyster bar.\" The New England clam chowder (the red version) was actually really good, had a ton of seafood and clams in it (though I tasted some small shell bits which wasn't nice), but it was really tasty, I recommend it. I got the fish of the day which was mahi-mahi, one of my top 4 fish behind sea bass, salmon, and swordfish, it was solid - grilled with lime and lemon pepper (nothing I couldn't have made on my own). I'd say as averagely tasty as it gets. I wouldn't really recommend this place for Vegas. It's not bad at all, also the service is very average to poor. For the price and location and ambiance you can go to a million better seafood spots.",

The chowder was the best!so peppery and good......the fra diavlo wasnt bad, but it did not deliver in the heat department for me, and im picky with mussels( Long island kid)....these were the extra large ones which tend to be tougher and harder to cook properly, i much prefer the smaller ones for tenderness and sweetness.  The biggest let down was the crabcake, way too much mayo/whatever mix...although there was a ton of meat too, they just need to take it easy on the binder? and it came to me too on cold plate which didnt help matters for the second one.

It was pretty busy when I arrived at 7:30pm on Tuesday on my own but it was still easy to find a seat at the bar. Definitely a casual restaurant!    There was a small display of fresh oysters on ice at the top of the bar and although they looked pretty inviting I was seriously in the mood for mussels so ordered a plate of steamed mussels fra diavolo and a glass of white wine.   The food was out within ten minutes and tasted great, a nice balance of tomato and spice but unfortunately they should have taken some more time to actually clean the mussels before cooking or serving as many of them still contained seaweed and other nasty looking contaminants.... Tasty but uncleaned mussels are a big no no!",

    "text": "This place is frustrating.  For years this was the first place I went to for lunch after arriving in town.  Oysters are one of my very favorite foods.  I loved eating at the oyster bar and slurping down a half dozen Blue Points.  I would then have either their superb Caesar salad with grilled shrimp or excellent crab Louis.  But the service is horrendous.  They are understaffed and, while some of the servers are nice, here is the main problem: the servers, cooks, and oyster shuckers all share the same tasks.  It takes forever to get your food.  There is no management here whatsoever.  Worst of all, I had been coming here a lot and it got to the point where I would be sitting there for a good ten or fifteen minutes before anyone even acknowledged me.  One of the guys even seemed pissed at me for no apparent reason.  And the last - and final - time I went here, there were bits of shell in my raw oysters.  Despite some really exceptional seafood, this place does not know how to treat customers.  There are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money at in Vegas.",

They have a nice selection of BIG oysters for your palate.  I tried a half dozen Fat Bastar* (yes, that's what they call them) and they were delicious.  We also split the catch of the day, which was Sea Bass.  Very good.  Cooked with large shrimp and scallops.  Couldn't get enough, it was that great.  Reasonably priced for what you get.  Raymundo is the chef.  He is great and has been working there over 10 years.  Call on him to make you something special.  No two orders are the same!!  DEE LISH!",

I'm so glad I was able to dine here with my family before watching Legends in Concert (show in Harrah's, see review).  It's a rather small spot, super open to the casino so when we walked in, the staff behind the oyster bar told us to sit wherever we wanted. We sat at the bar, not inside the restaurant but on the oyster side of the bar. There were five of us so we managed to pull together three SMALL round tables to fit our drinks and bread and butter our waitress brought out. Cool! It was a tight squeeze though!  Bread and butter, yum! Nice, crusty and wheat bread with room temp butter, yes I was drooling. My mom ordered the clam chowder and a CRABBY mary. The crabby mary has a nice sea taste that I loved. It was pretty strong, I had to help mom finish it, lol. Clam chowder tasted like the sea! The chowder was super chunky and the bowl was pretty big. We ordered two, two-dozen oysters and six oyster shooters. The oysters were really good! Kept fresh with good horseradish and cocktail sauce was the perfect topping. The horseradish sauce was super strong which is hard to find at some oyster/seafood place. The oyster shooters were six oysters topped with vodka and an extra-large shot of vodka chilled in the middle. My sister, her fiance and my dad and I were all buzzin!   The bill was pricey but it was well worth it. Good food with family making more crazy memories in Vegas = priceless.",

I've seen a few reviews that said this location wasn't the exact same as the one at Palace Station, but this will have to do for now.  We arrived around noon on Friday and seated ourselves at the bar (always sit at the bar if available, definitely more enjoyable). We weren't too hungry, so we ordered the O.B. Pan Roast ($34) to share for 2 people. Food came out very quickly, and our pan roast came with a good amt of seafood (clams, shrimp, crab, etc.) and the sauce was delicious (sweet and savory) with the rice. They don't cook in front of you at the bar (like at other locations I believe), so minus 1 star for the experience.   Probably wouldn't have finished one plate on my own, but also wouldn't be enough for 2 hungry people to share. Definitely won't mind coming back to eat this again.",

Came during lunch, it was pretty quiet and you just sent yourself. Sat at the bar, so I could watch the food being made, and read reviews on service and didn't want to be forgotten.   Ordered a dozen of blue point.  They didn't have other premium oysters to pick from, and ordered a flash fried calamari.   It came with a bread basket.  We didn't get anything with broth, so couldn't really dip the bread in anything (next time!!).    The calamari is really good, not too much batter, cute presentation and lots of calamari with 2 different sauces.  A warm spicy marinara sauce and Aioli. The warm marinara sauce went very well with the calamari.   The dozen of oysters were really fresh.  The horseradish had a strong kick with every shot.  Was definitely very good and service was great.  Had a lot of attention since we sat at the bar.  Will definitely come back and try some of their other menu items, but oysters are a must!",

A meal here is not cheap, but it is not outrageous either, you get what you pay for and the service is top shelf, many of the staff has been here for years and they have perfected their craft.

My mom says the oysters were delicious. The calamari, on the other hand, was not even edible. The first time it came out it was undercooked and bland. It tasted like chewy batter. Not so surprisingly, cooking them more was not enough to salvage them. My boyfriend said it wasn't edible. My stepdad said it was \"pretty great for cardboard.\" Go to The Perch for calamari, instead. It is almost half the price and MUCH tastier. It wasn't a total loss, though. The bread and chips they bring out before you order were fresh and delicious.",

Size, taste & texture are just the start..  Blue point oysters from NY are sweet, not briny and plump AF.  These were that and more. Maybe it was the naked cowboy hot sauce that came in the tower of treats or maybe it was the two dirty captain martinis or maybe it was the hot bartender?   Ordered a dozen and each one was better than the last. The horseradish was the kind that kicked any cold you have (or could have 10 years from now) to the curb REAL quick. Amazing.

    "text": "Ok, here's the deal.  I feel like an ass because I haven't written a review since my last trip anywhere (which was SF).  I realized, quite sadly, that I haven't visited anywhere new in a while that made me think of reviewing.  It seems to be a trip thing now--which clearly blows, since I live to review!!  Anywho, I went on another family escapade to Sin City during Spring Break.  We stayed at Harrah's again cause it was free.  Last time we ate there, I was somewhat disappointed.  This time, the experience was notably better.  We had dinner at their Italian restaurant that I didn't know existed until my mom suggested we have dinner there.   Here's the thing: we had arrived earlier that day, and my sister and I spent some time walking around the Strip until dinnertime.  We get to the restaurant and all I can say is that I was underdressed from here to yesteryear.  Woops!!!  Someone say something man!!  A change of clothes was only an elevator ride away.  But, as my cousin was quick to point out, not too big a deal--it's Vegas; you get brides and bums dining in the same restaurant at the same time.  (I was the bum!!)  I had a great Caesar salad to start.  Yes I sample Caesar salads a lot, cause it's one of those things--like the onion soup, or the fish tacos.  The bread basket was damn good, too.  A nice olive oil/vinegar brought to the table; shaken, not stirred.  The Pinot Grigio was darn good--really bold and flavorful.  I had scallops for dinner.  Oh were they good?!!!?!!  Umm, yes.  The potatoes were tasty, too.   I sampled my sister's pasta with vodka sauce and prosciutto and shrimp.  I really liked it.  You're supposed to taste the pasta in these dished people.  The pasta isn't supposed to be drowning in some thick sauce.  Dessert was ridiculous!!  We were stuffed full, but decided to order the dessert on the menu meant for two people.  So here comes this GIANT mound of cream.  (Apparently the dessert's name was \"white mountain\" in Italian---I have no cultural tact, clearly.)  Then, the waiter brings up this cart with a grill, lights the sucker and pours some lovely Amaretto into a pan.  Next thing you know, that liquid's on fire and is being poured (still with flames about) onto the white mound.  AHHHHH, white mountain on freakin' liquor fire!!!!  Yes, we attracted attention with our choice of dessert.  The bachelorette party at the next table took pictures...He cut into it, and it was dark chocolate and white chocolate gelato inside.  It was REALLY good!!!  BTW, it said for two...two what?  Hippos?!!?  The thing was HYUGE!!  No really, I'm a fatass, but really...  A final note on the ambience---a tad cheese, but who cares!?  It's Vegas.  Open kitchen with lots of flames and sounds and smells.  A traveling guitarist playing all the kitschy Italian hits---sing it if you know it!!!  (And my dad did know quite a few of them.  My lushed-up mother kept telling him that he sings much better than the guitarist and that he should take over...'nuff about that.)  The owner travelled from table to table chatting up the clientele.  All around a darn good time.",

They came with red cocktail sauce, lemon, grated horseradish (the strong, sinus-clearing stuff) plus a standard appetizer of some cracker bread with a roll  that they serve before every order.   Apparently they were grilled with some butter or some sort of oil.  The cracker bread was actually perfect with the oysters, their juices and the oil. I added some Tabasco sauce which they have available, to achieve my own personal taste perfection.   I only ordered a half-dozen, and wished I had ordered the full dozen!  Minus one star for somewhat shoddy service. I originally ordered crab cakes, but after several minutes they came back and said that they had not been able to start them yet and suggested other menu choices - normally I would dock 2-3 stars for this, but my second-choice of the grilled oysters was delicious enough to make me an instant fan of this place.",

    "text": "Oysters are often mistaken as a food, when in reality they are a quest. If you are an oyster junkie, you seek out your oyster options well in advance. Being somewhat seasonal, oysters are not always on menu. I have in past refused to dine at restaurants which had no oysters. Often I have called well in advance to try and get a restaurant to hold some for me if I felt supplies would be running short. I have even attempted to get chefs to order oysters for me rather than face the risk of there being none. As I said, it is a quest. This is why when we were rushing through Harrah's in Las Vegas last week to catch some show, and I noticed The Oyster Bar, I felt fortunate. I stumbled on this place. Normally I have to search out menus to find oysters, which are often hidden, or which appear only as an infrequent special. But, here was an oyster bar. Of course we got back ASAP after the show, found two open seats at the bar, and took in the scene. First there was a small mountain of oysters well iced down a few feet from our seats at the bar. Second, I noticed the cooking station for shellfish, a device which appeared to operate on steam, and designed for rapidly cooking small batches of shellfish. A really nice, open kitchen feature. A server chef appeared in moments to take a drink and appetizer order. I got the Sierra Nevada Ale, a beer so good they named some mountains after it. My wife ordered a chardonnay. My oysters were shucked in front of us, so I knew there was no phony baloney trickery being practiced here. As an aside, many chefs buy jars or buckets of pre shucked oysters and when an order comes in they open the small bucket, remove 6 or 12 oysters from the bucket and place them on sterilized shells which have usually gone thru the high powered dishwasher endlessly until the shell is pure white, thin, and looks like no oyster ever inhabited it. Nevertheless, as much as I frown upon this corrupt practice, I have discovered that eating oysters in this troubling way surpasses no oysters at all. But, I digress. We also ordered fish and chips, excellent, and key lime mousse, also a nice house version or play on the now ubiquitous key lime pie. The oysters were from 3 distinct beds, and all tasted supremely fresh, and unique. I liked the lemon wrapped in a lemon colored wrap with a green ribbon; 50's yes, but so nice. Service superb, food outstanding, price right. I'm ready to go back. Indeed, if I lived in Vegas, I'd own a seat at this great oyster bar.",

The calamari was tender and lightly breaded quite a large portion too (3 to 4 people).  We had a fish and pasta dish both was excellent.  The frutti de mare was a little bit spicy but good with a large amount of seafood.  The fish was scallops dusted with pistachios and sitting on top of creamed leeks.  We didn't have dessert but they looked good as they past the table.  The servers were very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. The wine by the glass was very limited. But all and all a great place to eat.",

It is in the most awkward area for a restaurant.  Ordered the lobster bisque - yummy and creamy! And I also had the salmon which was DELICIOUS! The portion was surprisingly generous. The salmon was nicely seasoned and the glaze was really tasty. It's served with white rice which was kind of awkward.  The bf ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail and half dozen half shells.  I assume he enjoyed it because he didn't leave any crumbs behind.  I wasn't that impressed with the service or the place.  \"meh\"",

Having read reviews of this place here on Yelp, I decided that some oysters would hit the spot, and my boyfriend agreed.  People, you were right! We split a dozen oysters (okay, I ate most of them) and got a couple of glasses of wine. The oysters were big, fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. And yay for horseradish! The wine was priced a bit higher than in Utah. However, our glasses would have been at least 1.5 glasses in Utah, so it worked out.   The service was quite good, and I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the place. It was great to sit at the bar, relax, and occasionally glance over at the college basketball on the TV.   We seriously considered coming back here a few times during our trip, but we decided that we needed to have some variety. However, I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas.",

We were staying on the strip and I noticed Harrah's had a restaurant of the same name so we decided to try it.  Yes it is more expensive than the one at Palace Station but it's packed with seafood.  My husband liked it so much he wanted to go back the next day.  We went there late so there was no line, they have regular tables too for those who don't like to sit at the bar type tables/chairs.  There was an additional discount if you went back within 24 hours.  In any event, the menu has a lot more items than the one at Palace Station.  Since starting this review, I've been back to the restaurant once more, still very good.  I also tried to go back to Palace Station- waited an hour and got out of line because I couldn't take it anymore so ...maybe we're going to just stick with Harrah's from now on.",

The menu is pretty extensive that it will take you a while to decide what to order.  You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes.  The Diablo shrimp pasta is really good.   I ordered the Oysters Royale with the creme fraiche and caviar, If you aren't familiar with oysters, not all of them are meant to be huge, in fact the smaller the size, the bigger the taste.  If you understand that fact, then you'll appreciate the Oyster Royale. I've never tasted oysters in that style before, im used to the more typical vinagrette or cocktail sauce, it was a different and delicious taste. Make sure to add a dash of fresh horseradish to every oyster in the Royale, it makes a huge difference!    The appetizers are very generous, the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked.  I will definately make it a point to visit the Oyster Bar again next time I'm in Vegas!",

We started off with the Lobster Bisque (so rich, and HUGE chunks of lobster), steamed clams in white wine broth (AMAZING) and some fresh oysters (SO FRESH!).  We also tried the crab legs, seafood risotto (swimming with seafood) and the scallops.  We loved everything, and felt that we really found a hidden gem in Vegas because you don't normally think of Harrah's as a dining mecca!  The prices were very reasonable compared to some of the high end dining options in Vegas...so I will be back next time I am in town!",

He didn't bring plates with the food and was annoyed when we asked for plates. He first brought very small bread plates. We then asked for larger plates because we wanted to share what we ordered. When the wait staff brought us full size plates, there was a pubic hair on the plates. We let the manager know and left without eating.

The Oyster Bar was far from meh though even if only rating the quality of the oysters.  They were ice cold, perfectly briny and served with some kick butt hot horseradish to add to your cocktail sauce.  Ate 4 dozen between the two lunches.  Also tried the seared tuna one of the days.  It was good, not great like the oysters though.  The only True downer was the clam chowder which was average at best.

Upon arrival, there was a sign saying to seat ourselves (not sure if this is the usual for them), which was no trouble for us as there was plenty of prepped tables available. We didn't have to flag down a server - we were addressed pretty quickly. The ambiance was dark and casual. My friend and I ordered a dozen oysters each, calamari, and the seafood risotto to share. All of our food came out relatively fast. Calamari was freshly fried, but other than that, nothing special there. The breading would have benefited from some salt and pepper. The oysters were fresh and the perfect size for me! The seafood risotto was delicious and they definitely didn't skimp on the seafood. The risotto was just a teeny bit undercooked, but really no complaints, still. At the end of the meal, we were able to get the check quickly. I was really satisfied with my meal and the service!",

FYI to management, people don't enjoy lurking around restaurants and people eating don't enjoy lurkers.",

    "text": "Two words: Oysters Royale. Raw, spicy (wasabi caviar AND amazingly fresh horseradish?!) and perfect. A great chive creme added a layer of smoothness and richness without taking away from the crisp, cold, amazing oysters or the flavor profile intended by the wasabi and horseradish. #foodgasm (I would have liked larger oysters, I can admit it. They seemed just a tad on the small side. -0.5)  The Caesar was really tasty and, it was huge! I don't care for tomatoes in a Caesar salad, but the overall dish was fantastic and tangy and bright. No way could I finish it (I was saving my limited space for those fantastic oysters!) but I gave it the old college try. Really great.  The pan roast my date had was rich and flavorful and packed with proteins. He said his favorite was from a place up in Reno, but this was a close second. I loved the sauce and found the herbs really fresh and the whole thing fairly well balanced. It needed a bit more salt to really make it pop. Just that little something was missing (-0.5). The lobster bite I tried was tender and juicy and I was told the rest of the fish was fantastic.  Service was on point; water and tea always full, checked on us often without hovering, and always with a smile. And - WOW! - so fast! Watching them put dishes together was an added bonus of sitting at the bar.  Really a great meal, great food and generous portions, served by a great staff. Yup, I am a fan!  Caveat: we sat at the bar. I don't know if table service is the same, but I want to point that out just in case.",

I sat by the bar where we got to see the staff opening the oysters up. It was pretty pricy but wasn't a surprised since we were in the middle of the dessert so it is probably hard to get seafood out there. Anyways I was extremely surprised by how fresh the oysters tasted and no sand!! I'm not exactly sure what the different oysters were because we got a mixed but I enjoyed them all.   My friend ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and did not enjoy it very much. It was red/orange and looked like a tomato soup. She actually said it tasted more tomato than clam chowder.   The restaurant is pretty small, the kitchen is right in front of you. If you sit by the bar you watch then make everyone else's dish. I guess this is why some of the other food isn't as amazing like some people were expecting because I don't think they had a specialize chef for some of the food. I saw like some guy who looked like the manager and other stuff help cook the food.",

My husband had a giant plate of fried oysters that both of us thought were terrific.  My sister and brother in law had a crab Louis that was lovely and generous with the crab meat, although could have used more actual lettuce.  Also shared a good sized portion of fried calamari.     It was exactly what I wanted.  I used to love raw oysters but was poisoned in Texas from raw gulf oysters and can no longer indulge.  I was so envious of those were partaking around us.

I suggest going REALLY light on the horseradish, it's super strong and spicy, but adds a nice kick if you're into that.

My friends were about to take things to the next level and I had very little in my stomach, so this pit stop was very necessary.  The shrimp were big and flavorful as was the accompanying sauce.  The complimentary rolls and butter were taken advantage of given the fact that this is an in-casino restaurant which - much like everywhere else in Las Vegas - was kinda overpriced.  If you have a Total Rewards card from the Harrah's group, use it to get a slight discount here.  I did not experience much of the menu, but what I did experience I liked very much.

They had the standard Bluepoints as part of their regular menu and three \"premier\" oyster options.  I ordered a dozen of their premier oysters on the half shell, Shigokus.  They were pretty darn good, and at $30, they should be.  Also had the bacon-wrapped scallops which were tender and juicy.  The Maryland crab cakes were also very good.  Their crab cakes were more the finely shredded type and no large chunks of crab, which I personally like to have.    For entrees I tried their special (New Your strip and fried soft shell crab) as well as their Jambalaya steamer.  The steak was good but the soft shell crab was a bit soggy.  The steamer had a good assortment of shellfish but a few clams were quite gritty from the sand.  The dessert menu was an afterthought and I ordered the Oreo cookie ice cream cake.      The service was a bit slow and the server didn't seem too knowledgeable about the handful of oysters being served.  I'd expect the waiters to be able to tell where an oyster came from and when it came in.  Is it firm or soft?  Salty or sweet?  Metallic, buttery, creamy, briny??        As an oyster bar, I wasn't terribly impressed.  Also the server added his own gratuity to the bill for me and two guests.  Really?  Altogether, with the $22 tip, the check was about $160 for three people.    Would I go here again?  Not likely.  I've had better $160 meals and I'd rather try a real oyster bar.",

Following Yelpers' advice, we tried the clam chowder to start, and as reviewed, it was outstanding, reminiscent of the best I'd had in Boston.   We also received some good bread to start our meal, which was nice.   We then followed with an oyster dish, forget the name, but it was oysters with spinach and parmesan and a horseradish sauce on the side. AWESOME. We ordered six, but I would've liked about twenty more.   We then had the shrimp jambalaya, which although not entirely NO authentic, was still very good. The shrimp were especially good. It seemed they'd been grilled first and then thrown in the jambalaya, creating a really complex flavor.   I really liked this spot. I also liked that by strategically ordering the chowder and the oysters, we were able to save some money, as the place is on the expensive side if you get chowder, an appetizer and two entrees.",

    "text": "If only I could give 6 or more stars... Without question, this was the best overall restaurant I went to while we were in vegas last week... In fact We went twice... First... Best oysters Ive had...bar none. Period. Freshest, overnighted daily.  Chef knows everything about his oysters and can supply you with more facts about them than you know existed.The naked cowboy and naked cowgirl oysters (yes, these are the actual names) are a branded oyster that will soon be instantly recognized by millions of oyster fans coast to coast. And the chef prepares them perfectly..  While there I also tried their new england clam chowder.. Barely any potatoes... Its all clam and again.. The best Ive had.  Chef Raymondo also served us up \"oyster shots\", some with bloody mary mix, some with a combination fat tire beer, cocktail sauce, and an oyster.  That was my first time on a shot like that... And wow! Incredible!  Chey Raymondo also prepared a grilled shrimp and pepper dish that was amazing.        I also must specifically call out Chef Raymondo as literally the best, friendliest, most charismatic chef slash server ever (when you sit at the oyster bar the Chef also serves).  When i went back the next day for lunch, Chef remembered I like Fat Tire and came right over with a 6 pack chilled on ince in a bucket.  Every time I am in vegas now I will stop at harrahs oyster bar... Multiple times!  Harrahs: great job on having the bar and whatever you do: keep Raymondo on your staff and happy.",

    "text": "I had to give this place 5 stars because it's such a great value for Vegas.  After a brief search on Yelp for an inexpensive seafood spot, Penazzi's was the overwhelming winner.  So once we got to Vegas and checked into our hotel, we headed down to Harrah's and plopped ourselves at the bar here.  The only time I've had raw oysters before was a couple shooters at the Acme Oyster House in New Orleans a long time ago, and even that had tabasco sauce and alcohol or something in it...so basically I had never had raw oysters because they skeeved me out a little bit.  I like mussels ok but I've always found clams to be too sea-water-tasting, and that's what I expected oysters to taste like too.  Well not these!! We ordered a half dozen raw and a half dozen fried oysters and they were as fresh as could be, and not ocean-y at all!!  In fact, I liked the raw oysters BETTER than the fried ones, because they were just so darn refreshing.  The fried oysters were serious though, because they were WHOLE--not the pieces you sometimes get at seafood restaurants.  When you bite into them, oyster juices go everywhere.    We were pretty hungry so we also ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and the linguini fra diavolo with mussels.  The bisque was pretty gross in my opinion, but they sure weren't skimpy with the mussels!!!  It was good, but pretty spicy.  The raw oysters were the clear winner of the evening.  This place isn't cheap by any other city's standards but it really is a pretty good deal in Vegas--I highly recommend you check it out!!",

After finally getting a hold of him and preventing him from running away he was nicer the rest of the meal.  The oysters were puny! But at least they were fairly fresh. For two people we ordered  half dozen oyster rocker feller ( good and rich) half dozen oyster royale ( this was gross, i had to force myself to finish it) dozen raw oysters crab louie salad ( generous crab portions, avocado was black however) parmesan crusted halibut ( i think was decent)  The lady shucking the oyster was moving at a snail's pace. We waited forever while we watched her shuck them in slow motion. It was similar to waiting for water to boil. She really should stop talking to the cook and needs to concentrate on working more.  We didn't complain but our server actually came over several times to point out he knew it was taking a while. He even looked over at her and said \"she is very slow\". The table to the right of us complained about how long their order was taking, as did the table to our left; both tables arrived way after we did.  Bill was about 115.",

Infinitely disappointed that we decided to come here instead just because it was walking distance. The service was terrible. Server didn't seem to know whether or not any of our food had come- forgot to ring in desserts, and was absent for a very long time when we were ready to order. The food was alright. The seafood risotto and the shrimp scampi were so, so bland that we all had to use tons of lemon and salt to even make it worth eating. Two people in our party had some sort of seafood combo in broth that they quite liked, and the raw oysters on the half shell were good. The drinks were all sub par at best. My $10 glass of wine tasted no better than the Sutter Home Cabernet that I had gotten from a corner store the night before. Server forgot to bring out desserts and forgot to put them on our bill (luckily he realised his mistake and stuck with not including them). Really disappointing overall.",

The positive about this place is there is a lot more seating and workers, just a bigger restaurant in general.   Other positive is the good friendly service.  Got the OBs pan roast which is crab, lobsters, muscles and clams with rice and tomato sauce. It was ok. It wasn't as creamy as other restaurants, it was actually really watery so that threw us off. We got the portion for 1 and it might be enough for 2, this portion runs about $35.  We also got the half dozen oysters grilled. I thought this was pretty good, runs you about $20?   Another negative, $4.5 for ginger ale. Come on now lol. Just a so so place, wouldn't come back w all the other options.",

The last time I was here I had their jambalaya which was pretty good.  This time I was curious to try their pan roast since I loved the one over at Palace Station, so we ordered the Pan Roast for two.  O.B. Pan Roast (for two) -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lfVazi&s=44afd9016eaa3f07015c187c194cd2dd87d67cf1744fb8c819381f2c1f642425\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lfVazi</a> Lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams and mussels, smoked tomato cream sauce and jasmine rice.  It's just a ton of seafood awesomeness.  Though it was lacking in the rice department.  We had to pay $5 for an extra bowl of rice.  I have to say though, in comparison to the \"Bouill-Roast\" at Palace Station, it's good, but not as great as the pan roast at Palace Station.  However, you can't complain with the huge amount of seafood that they put in.  My mom and I barely finished it, with me finishing off most of it.  Overall, the Oyster Bar at Harrah's is still a decent spot.  My mom and I were pretty satisfied with their pan roast for two.  I guess if you can't make it out to Palace Station's Oyster Bar, this is actually the next best thing.",

I had so many people rave to me about this restaurant and the first time trying it I wasn't a fan at all .. I thought it was just a hype and maybe I waited for over two hours it just ruined my experience as a first timer . I decided to give this spot another try while being in harrahs and the pros about the restaurant is the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. The dining space was pretty big and the best part is if you're staying in harrahs it's no more than a 3 minute walk from your hotel to the restaurant.   While being in Vegas on our last night, my family and I decided to grab dinner here before heading out and doing our activities before going home. The host was very nice and greeted us right away and made sure we had a table cleaned up and ready for us. While sitting down our sever brought over some complementary breads and butter to start us off. I'm a huge fan of calamari so that had to be order along with  their New England chowder, pan roast , salmon and rice dish, oysters & the rossito.   I should've gotten the servers name but let's just say it was a horrible experience once again. He was very lazy with an attitude the whole time . We mention to him how horrible the calamari tasted. Some pieces tasted like it's been out for a long time and just thrown back in there, some others tasted really battered up, and lastly it was super salty. I love salty food but this was a no go for me in my books. The chowder was decent nothing to hype about. The salmon and rice seemed good because my son finished all of it. Oysters were good thank goodness everything else was just ok.   Overall, if anyone was to ask me if I would dine here again my answer will be a no.",

The pan roast is good with a healthy portion of seafood, including lobster, crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops.  The seafood risotto, cioppino, and other entrees are all quite good.  It really hits the spot when I'm craving a pan roast since there are limited options.  The main knock on this place is that it is consistently woefully understaffed and/or poorly managed.  Each time I have been there, I have had to stand at the hostess stand for minutes just to be acknowledged.  Even then, although there are available tables, they still have to set a table for us, which takes another several minutes of amateur coordination.  This place is rarely full, and accordingly only have 1 or 2 waiters working.  Tables are left un-bussed for an indefinite amount of time after customers leave, and even flagging someone down for your check takes a few minutes.    Come here to enjoy the seafood at a leisurely pace and you'll be fine.",

We ordered the Alaskan King Crab, 2 Surf n Turf, and fish n chips, calamari, and oysters Rockefeller. The calamari was rubbery. The oysters Rockefeller was microwaved. The Alaskan king crab had to be sent back!! It was so incredibly dry it was unedible!!! Our server had the manager come over and she went and talked to the chef who said that if he made another order that they'd come out the same which means that they were old and supposed to have been already thrown away. Our Surf n Turfs came out just fine but steaks were super bland. No seasoning what so ever. The roasted potatoes were wicked salty. The lobster tails were almost as dry as the crab legs with no flavor. Bland AF. The fish n chips was honestly the most edible thing that came out of that kitchen. The bill was $300.00. If it hadn't been comped, I would've had a fit at the prices and quality. I would never suggest to eat here. The guy at the table next to us ordered a beer and sent it back because there was something grey and floating in it. Then his entire party got up and left!! I don't blame them at all!! How this place has an A rating from the HD is beyond me. One positive note is the service was spot on. Poor guy. We tipped 20%.",

WE both agreed something cold and yummy needed to satisfy our little hunger. Nice cold oysters at an Oyster bar. Let me tell you it was a nice little bar located inside Harrah's hotel my boyfriend and I sat and they brought us this basket of chips, butter and bread it looked really good. We got oysters, oyster shots fill with tequila and shrimp linguine ( my man got that and it was good lol ) we could have given this place a four star but it did take a while for them to attend to us and give us our bill.. we will come back next year.. or maybe sooner.",

The fish & chips weren't that great because the fish fell apart, smelled like it wasn't fresh, and it tasted like mush with tartar sauce. The \"chips\" were actually quite nice, it was seasoned well and had chili powder lightly dusted on them for a small kick. My friends ordered the dozen oysters. I was not a fan of oysters so I didn't eat them but my friends said they were ok. The oysters were fresh but with the cream it felt too mushy and creamy. I would come here again but probably not order the fish & chips again but definitely try something else.",

Super clean flavor but my only complaint is that they did not cut the foot and I had to do it myself. The horseradish was strong and the cocktail sauce was good.  And at least 6 choices for hot sauce on your table.   Clam chowder:   Very very tasty.  I actually just asked the cook how it is and he gave me a half ladle. I will be back to order this in a bread bowl later this week.    Salmon:  cooked perfectly!  Medium and flaky. I was a bit of a bother asking for a slightly different preparation than on the menu and the cook said \"easy no problem\". I asked for with pasta and they were quick and efficient.   Only ding was the pasta was slightly over cooked.   All in all I would return.  Ly and Dennis were great help at the counter  4 stars is due to ambiance and Chinaware. Not food or service.",

The New England Clam Chowder has always been good especially with their complimentary flat bread.  My favorite meal is the Surf and Turf.  They do have a full bar so pairing a nice cocktail or even a simple Coors Light with your meal is possible.  I would recommend sitting at the long bar just inside so you are no separated from the cooks by a sneeze glass as you are at the outside curve bar.  Also while seated at the inside bar you are able to watch the TV on the back wall of the kitchen.    Dennis has always been our favorite.  We were bummed earlier this year when Dennis was out do to a motorcycle accident.  He is now back and his hi-energy will make your visit enjoyable.",

Keep in mind I happened to be with some affiliate companies and they are a goofy bunch.   When we arrived I saw that it was busy but the front of the house seemed overwhelmed. We needed a drink after a long day so we creeped into the bar space. I was confused as if I could order a beer or if it would be invading the space of everyone at the counter and bam, greeted by a happy face that brought us to a comfortable area. Beer and bloody in hand the table was now ready.   Server was friendly but didn't exactly match the personality of some of the guys at the table. I would have like to see the same welcome as we got from our friendly flexible bartender.   First order came and our platter of cold seafood got the undivided attention it deserved. Lobster,shrimp, clams, and crab overflowing on an 18\" platter will calm any growling stomach. I finished with a Halibut dinner and went back to our hotel room thinking about the food.

Cody behind the bar is gracious with drinks and plenty of horseradish for the oysters.  Lopez shucks oysters without any flakes of shell or grit. These are fresh and nice quality oysters. My husband preferred the mild Blue Points while I was sold on the South Pacific oysters that were as big as my hand. The British Columbia oysters were a bit briney like a dirty martini with 75% olive juice but I'm not complaining.   My only negative would be a lack of a bathroom. I was halfway to Henderson by the time I found it past the Elara. Bring your walking shoes, an appetite and a Kobayashi desire to down 60 oysters in 60 minutes.",

He returned and said that the manager had advised him that they were definitely closed for the evening yet there were still people ordering food who had recently been seated.    As a total rewards diamond member, I was surprised to see this at a restaurant that we frequent quite often.  We spent $60 on cab rides between getting to Harrah's and eventually going  to Javier's as our secondary option.    The general manager of Oyster Bar should definitely be aware of this if he or she isn't already.

We ordered half a dozen of oysters to share, and I ordered a seafood bouillabaisse, my hubby ordered a jambalaya, since they don't have kids menu, I asked our waiter if I could have some plain white rice and a piece of chicken for my toddler (just a plain white rice and a dry chicken breast, they charged me 11 dollars!!!). The oysters were fresh but quite small since they were blue points. My dish was full of seafood, but lack of any favorite, the booth tasted just like the water from steaming the seafood with salt:(and my hubby only had a few bites of his jambalaya; he said it didn't taste right. I tried and I was like he was right, the jambalaya tasted like a rice mixed with a big can of tomato with sugar.   Our waiter was not too attentive; and when he brought us the bill, we got charge an extra order of a jambalaya (20 bucks more) and alSo noticed that he charged us 11 dollars for the kid meal (again just plain white rice with a small piece of dry chicken breast) Good that I checked...I pointed out an extra dish that we didn't order to him and he fixed the bills.  We didn't order any drink, but the bills came out about 90 dollars; for a meal like this with the kind of service at this kind of restaurant was totally overpriced!   Will not recommend and will not be back again!!! The meal was not good and price was not right. Take your money and go else where.",

The kitchen is open and you can see all the food being cooked right in front of you.  Sitting at the bar you also had access to the latest sports game on the screen.  The bartender/waiter was great too.  He was prompt, attentive and kind even though he was soooo busy!    Food was good - bread was great, crunchy!  And I had a wonderful salad with shrimp that I made on special request that they had no problem making for me.    I would go back!  It's in the middle of Harrahs but once you are inside you would not remember you were in the casino.",

    "text": "My first impression was, \"Raw oysters and cajun food, I'm so there.\"  Located in the midst of all your slot machines at Harrah's, you really don't need to go anywhere else in the middle of your fun testing your luck. You won't have to take a chance with this place because the food is actually very good, and good quality, despite the fact that its not actually a restaurant but more a booth in the middle of all the slot machines. We had fried oysters and the cajun jambalaya. The seasoning for the jambalaya was so flavorful and rich, but not overpowering. They don't skimp on the shrimp and sausages (yummy) and the portions are great to share with an appetizer and drinks. It's seriously amazing how all this great food comes out of a station kitchen. The service is great, and the setup really adds to the Vegas atmosphere. Fine dining options are vast on the Strip, but sometimes you're in need of a little convenience to your fun without sacrificing great taste. The Oyster Bar is your answer!  The lasting impression? \"Quick bite pit stop, or a place to wind down, it's the perfect place for oysters and more.\"",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars.  I've been here 3 times already.  The 1st time was the best and that was a few years ago.  They had 3 different types of oysters and had some Alaskan beer that went well with it.  Today, only 2 types (blue points and fanny bay) and no more Alaskan beer.    I can eat raw oysters all day.  Seriously.  I've had 4 dozen in one sitting before and could eat more.  I mean, oysters don't even fill you up.  But the problem is, oysters tend to be kinda pricey.  That's honestly what stops me from sitting around all day and eating them.  I just run out of money.  I took my friends here-especially Luis because every time I'm at an oyster bar I text him.  I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years and I think this place started this traditional.  Well, we finally met up in Vegas so of course I have to take him.  I get some raw oysters and a dozen of their baked oysters.  Art discovers he's not too keen on raw oysters.  Well, it is an acquired taste.  James is allergic to shellfish and John and Luis don't mind them.  In fact, Luis orders the tequila shot oysters.  I can't honestly remember the last time I had a oyster shooter.  So we split all this.  The oysters are good.  The baked ones are really good.  It's rare that I enjoy cooked oysters whether baked or fried but these are really good.  I definitely recommend them.  The shooters are pretty good too.  I mean, tequila and raw oysters just mix well.    I can't say this is the best oyster bar in Vegas.  In fact with only 2 types of oysters I suspect it's not.  But for the strip it's gtg.",

The pasta dish had too much sauce, waaay to much and I almost sent it back but I ended up putting napkins to suck up some of it (TMI??).  But the flavor was great.

I cant say that I would choose to eat oysters all the time but i did enjoy the experience and we got to try differnt breeds (i had no idea there was different kinds, i also did not realize that they are still alive when you eat em... weird) with different toppings.  I had the surf and turf and can highly recomend it. The fillet mignon was as good as any but it was the lobster tail that had me drooling. Im not a huge fan of Lobster tail as it usually has the texture of prawns. This tail was the most tender piece of meat! The flavor was off the chain and it was as tender as a piece of white fish.

    "text": "Everything you expect at a great restaurant found in such a small place; inside a hotel too!  The food: We had the oysters, the clam chowder, and the rib eye the four times we came here.  First of all, the clam chowder is the best I have ever eaten!  I absolutely LOVE clam chowder and eating it here delighted my taste buds so much that my mouth almost leaped for joy that first taste.  In my humble opinion, the rib eye steak here has got to be the best steak in Vegas.  Eating at other places, we thought it was really salty.  Personally, I think they go a bit overboard with their spices, but here, it was simply amazing to see that this place advertises oysters and yet, their steak is the best in Vegas!  Very funny in a sense.  Now, the oysters!  The oysters taste great, very fresh, and worth the price.  One time, they had special oysters flown in from Japan.  Six dollars more for a dozen, but my goodness, worth the price!  Once you put them in your mouth, they just melted; leaving your mouth in such ecstasy; that you wonder how you have ever lived without tasting such great food.  The one thing I do not suggest are their Bloody Marys.  I thought it was way too salty and they should balance how much vodka they use.  It overpowered the tomato juice and accentuated on the saltiness rather than a little bit of both spiciness from the Tabasco and the complimentary taste of the tomatoes.  The service: Every time we came here, the service was excellent.  We never waited too long with the food, and every few minutes the waiter would tell us about how the food was coming along.  Plus the kitchen is not too far from view so you could see if they were lying or not.  They appeased our cravings by giving us what we needed with our food.  Everyone was always smiling which made this place so inviting.    This place should be bigger and more advertised, and has become one of our go to places when we come to Vegas.  With superb service and food, this restaurant is one of our Vegas trip highlights when thinking about food.  Happy yelping.",

    "text": "BEFORE YOU HATE ON MY RATING, I just have to say that my review is NOT for the oysters.  I don't eat oysters, not because I don't like them, but because I'm afraid to like them..too much.  Haha.  So I'm sure this is the place to go if you want oysters but my review is solely for their crab cake, sauteed clams in white sauce, and their customer service.  First the crab cakes: very good price.  I read the menu and knew right away that that was what I was going to order.  $16 for crab cakes is about right..but wait until see the size of those babies!  They give you two huge gallops of crab cake, with real crab meat and a slight crunch on the outer layer.  The salad it sat on was amazing and the sauce it came with was even better.  I'd come back for their crab cakes anytime!  Now their pasta:  I was preferring the Shrimp Scampi but since my friends were already ordering the sauteed clams in white sauce, I thought..wth, I'll give that a try.  If it weren't for this dish, I may have given Oyster Bar 4 stars.  But because of this dish, I've decided to subtract a star.  ALMOST TWO!  This dish was...unacceptable for a restaurant of their status.  Yea, they give you a lot of clams...more like a lot of shells with no clams inside!  I thought, maybe they all fell out.  No.  I know the difference between clams and pasta.  It was really bland, too.  I couldn't even finish my portion.  The three of us left a pretty large amount of pasta behind.  No doggy bag, thanks.  Finally, their service.  Although friendly, it was slow.  We had a party of 9 but was waiting for 2 more.  Our waiter told us to \"holler\" when we were ready but how do we HOLLER if he's nowhere to be seen?  Also, two elderly ladies walked in and were seated next to us about 15 minutes after we sat down.  How come they were served bread before us?  Doesn't make sense.  So all in all, 4 stars for crab cake, 1 for clam pasta, 2 for service.",

    "text": "Another great meal at the Oyster Bar this week.  The first time I came here was over ten years ago, when my sister was in LV for her boards review course, and I was the newly-legal baby sis tagging along.  During those days, we were still pinching our pennies, so decided to stay at Harrah's...I have such fond memories of our stay there.  And still, it's Harrah's that I keep returning to--no matter what hotel I sleep at--to play at their tables, and the dealers have always been kind to me there.    But yea, after a weekend of meals over 1, 2, 3, and yes $400 (L'Atelier) for two people at chi-chi snooty restaurants, this was such a nice break.  It still wasn't cheap, but man, were those oysters delicious, the service excellent, and the ambiance just the right amount of cheese-y proletariat fun.  I loved that our server was well-versed on the types of oysters they had, and where they came from...Malpeques from PEI, Blue Points from Long Island, Kumamotos from Willapa Bay, Washington, and Kusshi's from Vancouver.  So. good.  And yes, I'm all about supporting the Gulf economy and their shellfish industry, but maaan, do the oysters from the Northwest and Northeast just kick the silt outta those swampy funky Southern bivalves.   They make a mean bloody mary too.  Awesome!!",

The flat sesame cracker/bread was sooo good. Wine list was decent. One of my friends had Halibut and said was good. Other had Oysters Rockefeller and said was tasty. My bf said calamari was fabulous. Price for fresh seafood was decent. I liked it!",

I sat there for 10 minutes watching her dig her long fingernails into all sorts of food, grabbed dirty cash with her hands, and went back to digging into food again.  So disgusting.  Then saw another man put back the leftover sauce into a container that they would later scoop out for the next customers.  I told the manager what I just witnessed and all she could say was: \"I'm sorry, I'll tell the chef about it\"  THAT'S IT !!!  While the manager was talking to me, the lady was still digging her naked hands into the food.  What the Fuck !!!  Nastiest place ever.  This restaurant should be shut down immediately.",

    "text": "Can we say YUM? The last time I was in Vegas, (last year), a bunch of my friends went to the Oyster Bar inside Harrah's, while myself and others went to the pool. They were talking about the oyster bar for days after. So this time, I had to go.  I went with my BF and another couple in the middle of the day on a Saturday. Not busy at all. We sat ourselves, and look @ the menu/place mat. We ordered 2 dozen raw oysters, (20/dozen), 2 bowls of clam chowder (6/bowl?), and an order of Manila Clam Steamers in the White Broth (18/order), and I ordered a Mai Tai, which wasn't very strong at all and was $10. (I have no tolerance, so if I say a drink isn't strong.. it's NOT)  The oysters were good, a little larger than I'm used to, but good. They were served with lemon juice, cocktail sauce, and horseradish. We asked for additional tabasco sauce. The clam chowder was delicious. A little thicker than I'd prefer, but good. The clams were my favorite. The clams were small-ish, but the broth was so, so, sooo good. We soaked up our bread and devoured it. I was sad when our waitress took it away. Which by the way, our waitress, Angie, was super nice and super friendly. Loved her.  So going back next time.",

    "text": "I guess the only reason I am not giving them a 5 star is simply because I usually set the bar really high, so a 4 star from me means definitely worth a try!  We ordered a dozen oyster(half fresh and half fried), they tasted so good and fresh(my stomach didn't complain what's so ever). They gave us three types of sauces for fresh oyster-- cocktail, horseradish, and ranch.( they also provide tobasco)  I ordered sauteed clam pasta with white sauce. Not only it tasted good, they gave me lots of clams--Seriously-- I think I probably got 25+ or so  clams, and they gave me another big bowl for shells.  My friend ordered seafood risotto which was filled with clams, mussel jumbo shrimp and even real lobster! They don't use strong wines like many Italian places in Cali do, instead it has stronger flavor of tomato sauce.  As of price, I think it is very subjective. Some might feel it dirty cheap, some might feel the opposite. My opinion is, given the quality and the service( the guy who gave us service that night was extremely friendly and helpful), it is definitely not pricy. Most of their dishes are priced like many mid-level Italian restaurants in Cali, but they have a better quality!",

Hell, I love them so much that I made my bf walk 1 mile down the strip in 103 degree weather JUST so I could eat them. Did I mention that this was right after we finished having lunch too? Yeah, he definitely hated me that day.   At $20 for a dozen or $12 for half dozen, I think this place is a great deal. The oysters are fresh, the servers give you all the condiments to go with it (lemon, horse radish, cocktail sauce, etc) and my entire time there turned into a oyster binge-eating contest all by myself (boyfriend was too full from lunch to join me) Hell, it was so good that the server convinced me to buy another dozen. I still can't believe I spent $40 just eating oysters but oh well.  I wanna say this is this is the best because frankly, I don't know where else they would sell oysters for such a good deal. The half-dozen price is pretty common but the $20 dozen price is what made me love this place.   I'm not a fan of Harrah's but this oyster bar makes me love Harrah's just a little bit more.",

    "text": "We found the Oyster Bar through Yelp and it certainly lived up to the positive reviews.  We liked it so much, in fact, that we had dinner here twice over our Vegas weekend trip.  Where do I start?  The oysters on the rocks are incredibly fresh and at only $20 a dozen, it doesn't get much better than that.  The crab cakes are absolutely delicious and the calamari was crisp on the outside and tender to the bite.  The bouillabaisse is loaded with fresh lobster, scallops, jumbo prawns, mussels, and clams and is simmered in a rich, saffron-infused broth.  The jambalaya pasta had a creamy, smoky, flavorful sauce and was generously tossed with chicken, sausage, and jumbo prawns.  The grilled king crab legs were phenomenal.  They were served hot and coated in a buttery glaze of seasonings and spices and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.  The wait staff is great too.  Our waitresses on both occasions were friendly, accommodating, and attentive.  I've been visiting Las Vegas twice a year for the past 8 years already and I've paid anywhere from 2 figures to 4 figures for meals depending on where I wish to dine.  I'd have to say that the Oyster Bar has been one of the better dining experiences I've had without costing me an arm and a leg.  It makes me wonder if some of those haute cuisine venues are simply full of overpriced pretension.  *note* Although the Oyster Bar is adjacent to Penazzi, they're actually 2 different restaurants.  The Oyster Bar does not take reservations, it's first come first serve and you seat yourself.  (which isn't as bad as it sounds, it was never overcrowded and we never had to wrestle for seating)  The Oyster Bar and Penazzi also have independent menus, so don't make the mistake of making a reservation at Penazzi thinking you can order items from the Oyster Bar.  Some of the other reviews are confusing in that aspect and I wanted to clarify because my family and I nearly commited that blunder.",

    "text": "1. The Oyster Bar is actually more of a lunch counter with a few chairs and tables, and definitely a generic bar theme. It was small but not intimate.  2. It was not busy this Monday late afternoon, early evening. It read \"Seat yourself\" and we did but the staff seemingly ignored us.   3. The service was minimal. An order was taken, food was delivered - there was no intermediate service for refills or asking how our food was or checking in on us, and then the bill. The waiter disappeared on us twice for extended periods in this small place. Once, he was chatting up another waiter with his backed turned to us for several minutes. Another time, the male waiter walked quickly, hands free, right by us - with our two glasses empty, one Pepsi and another water - and didn't bother to look or notice. A second female waiter eventually came by but by then it had been about 10 minutes.   4. Furthermore, when the small complimentary bread was gone, I wanted a little more but then again the waiter did not come by.   5. The price for my Salmon at $22, a dozen oysters at $22, clam chowder at $7, a Cosmopolitan drink at $14, and Pepsi at $3.50 plus tax and tip seemed excessive to us for the quality, portion size and (lack of) service.   6. My Salmon was a little dry but okay. The Asparagus consisted of four stalks and four carrots with some okay rice.   7. I think many of the reviews are valid but some appear to be paid reviews to counter actual negative reviews.  8. On the good side, the oysters were good.",

We sat down at the bar around midnight and we were ready to spend some money. Wow... Where do I even begin with thr service.. Trent was the worst server I have ever had in my life. I asked him for our bread after waiting for about 10 minutes. He completely ignored me and then later came wuth the bread without saying a word. I then asked him if they had pan roast available. He said \"uhhhh pan roast.....alright....\" and then went off again. I assumed that he put our order in. 15 mins later I asked him nicely if our pan roast was coming out and then he replies \"uhhh... The pan roast.... Uhhhh\" and then he just dissapears again!! Unbelievable... At this point, my boyfriend and I are so annoyed that we immediately ask for our check for the oysters we ordered from a different server.. And guess what?? He ignores us again. -_- Finally we yell at him for the check and when he came out with the check I gave him my players card and asked him for my discount. He then starts complaining about how he needs to go back and redo the whole check. SO FKN WHAT?!! wow we were so fed up at this point, we let him have it. We pretty much told him he was the worst server ever and how we would never come back. The worst dining experience ever... Go to the oyster bar at Palace Station. The drive is well worth it, the food and service is a million times better than this.  This place should get 0 stars for its crappy service but I'm being nice by taking the food into consideration so they get a regretful 2 stars in my book.",

    "text": "After reading this is the best oyster place on the strip expectations were high. We went there with a party of 8 on a Thursday afternoon around 4pm. We were sat down and given menus. After 15minutes Carlos, our waiter, came over and took drink orders and asked if he wanted separate checks we said yes if possible but no big deal if it's on 1 check. Carlos looked flustered and walked away, I noticed he walked to the back area which wasn't hidden, and was talking to another server moving his hands and pointing at our table frantically. So Carlos comes back now asked if we were ready. My order was 1/2 dozen of oysters and a salad with shrimp but I asked for no onions or peppers. As I was asking for that my friends Carlos was shaking his head! The next order my friend asked if a oyster list was available and he started shaking his head at her and said no and start rambling off oysters which it was so fast it was incoherent. Now everyone in our group realized he was not excited to be waiting on us. So after we ordered we asked for the manager. One of out friends went to the casino floor and noticed Carlos waiting on another table and he said Carlos seemed like a different person smiling and all. Our food comes out oysters we good they were blue points. My salad was disappointing, the shrimp was over cooked and not enough tomatoes. So as we are eating the manager comes over. Now I should add 7 out of 8 of us work in the food service industry 3 out of that 7 are general managers so we know service is important. So we tell the manager how we felt about Carlos' service and it's unacceptable. We also told her about out background in food service and she agreed and wanted to rectify the situation offered discounts which we declined because we aren't free loaders we just wanted to give feedback like we would at our restaurants. So the manager offered grilled oysters which were pretty decent and she said Carlos won't be serving us the rest of our meal. Well 2 minutes later here comes Carlos in a over exaggerated tone asked how is everything? We just stared at him like really dude. But after that we had another server. The prices were high which is probably expected in a casino, for the price I expected better food, and the service was sub par. With this past experience I won't go back.",

Staying at Harrah's this trip, gave the oyster bar in the casino a chance.  Service was real damn slow.  Really slow.  On a Wednesday.  During lunch.  Oysters were okay, ordered with the pico, wished I hadn't, it's nondescript and not very spicy, did not improve the oysters, which were pretty small.  Waited5 minutes before I found anyone to bring me crackers.  That should never be the case in an oyster joint.  Anyway, reviews recommended the pan roast.  The tomato broth was described as creamy.  Sweet is a better descriptor.  Another 5 minutes to find someone to bring me a lemon to cut the sweetness. It was like Campbell's tomato soup sweet, but sweeter.  Seafood was pretty good, cooked just right, but the broth ruins it.  If you're in Hatrahs and feel like you have to eat there,  save your money and go to the noodle bar, pad Thai is excellent, and service is prompt and courteous.  Or go to the South Point and order the Seafood Diavolo at the oyster bar there.  It's well worth the money.",

And the flash fried calamari is awesome (abnormally large pieces) especially since it's only an appetizer. Plus the service is great and the environment is casual so it's much easier to be in and out and back to partying it up on the strip!",

    "text": "After all the great reviews I had read and all the hype about how wonderful the food is, which I'm sure it probably is. I am quite upset that we were never tended to. Our party of five literally sat and waited for 45 minutes after our waters and bread bowl were brought to us, without anyone acknowledging us to take our order. Finally one of us decided to bring this to the attention of the server and someone who appeared to be a supervisor, short older gentleman on this day wearing a yellow woven shirt, just said yeah sure we will have one sent over. We waited yet again. I can see they were getting a bit uneasy, because truth be told we kept eyeing for someone to at least acknowledge and come take our order or to let us know they would be by in a bit. Out of the 3 gentleman, standing, staring at each other I don't believe there was not enough time to stop by and take an order that would have taken less than 2minutes. Also if you have the time to put on some ChapStick then YES! You definitely have time to take a quick order. Needless to say 5 hungry and dissapointed guests that are local and who were really looking forward to trying out the oysters left without ever getting served. 1 person I will mention was Gaby she was really sweet as we sat down. Working in the service and hospitality business this is quite sad to see.",

We ordered a half dozen grilled oysters and a a half dozen fried oysters, and we were VERY happy with both.   We've had some really fine fried oysters lately here in San Diego ... the trick is just that perfect balance between a bit of crunch and the perfect essence-of-the-sea wet burst of the oyster.  Too breaded and heavy can be overpowering or gooey and bad.  Too light and the water can make it soggy.  These were, as Goldilocks might say, just right.  We normally would have gone for our favorite classic Oysters on the half shell, but read some reviews recommending the grilled ones.  I'm SOOoo happy we ordered these ... they were silky and oystery and warm and liquidy and hot parmesan-cheesy.  Amazing, and if you're new to oysters, let these win you over!  Between my hubby and I, four thumbs up!",

Since it has 4 starts, i figured it couldnt be bad... oh boy... was i wrong. Food:   Oysters were already pre-opened.  who knows how long they've been sitting there uncovered.  It's raw food!  Dont you think it should be handled better? Crab salad:  The crab leg was still FROZEN when i tried to eat it?!  wtf... the green leaves were black and beat up.  dude, a $20 salad cant even have crispy leaves?!  the crab salad itself?  it tasted like you brought the tuna salad to your pinic and let it sit under the sun.  **YUCK**  After the nasty taste, the plate was still full.  I didnt even touch my dinner because of what we had to see. I didnt ask how my friend liked his orders but he didnt really eat his dinner. Service: OHMYGOD!!!!  it's disgusting!!!  Just thinking about it now gives me goosebumps.  The lady named Rosi...she's the worst person to ever be in the food industry left alone at Harrah's.  Since our waiter was too busy talking to the other customer even though we tried to get his attention for too long; we looked at her to see if she can help us get our waiter.  Her response was \" your waiter is over there.\"  No sh*t, i know that, so i asked if she can help me get him.  Her response was \"he will come when he comes\".  WTF?!  She was just standing there!  Then she started to clean up.... oh man, this is the worst part, Rosi.  She started to dig to the dirty containers to consolidate things BARE handed while a box of gloves was right in front of her.  We sat at the bar, so we saw everything.  She then wiped her hands to her uniform shirt, no not an apron, where she had been leaning against everything!  Then she moved on to dig into the raw shrimps, lobster tails, ..., pushing them down to cover them with those bared dirty hands w/ long red finger nails.  Not to mention, she wore a dangling bracelet that touched everything!  **YUCK**  Again, it's raw food!!!  oh then, her co-worker came and gave her share of tips, she touched the money, too, then went back to touching the food.  really?  I wanted to throw up bc I didnt know if she touched my food.  So we stopped eating. Another guy came over, brought the finished plate from previous eaters, grabbed the leftover cocktail sauce from that plate and put it back in the big container where they scooped out the sauce for the next customers.  Really?  you can charge people $23 for a dozen, yet you re-used the sauce from a raw dish.    So, we paid $100 for a dinner that we didnt touch.  We paid $100 to watch how disgusting this place was!  My friend didnt even want to pay cz we didnt even eat!  we would rather spend $100 on in-n-out!  All the manager said was, she would bring it to the chef's attention and ran for her life.    I wouldnt be surprise if people get food poisoning from this place.  I went and took my digestive enzymes right way, and drank more alcohol at a different place to kill the germ, well at least mentally, it would, after seeing that disgusting Rosi.",

I love my oysters with vinegar, which isnt primarily available until I asked the waiter for some. And I asked for Old Bay. The water alone is HORRIBLE in Vegas. Seriously tastes like pool water. You can taste it in the oysters.   I ordered the Alaskan King Crab legs - They were overcooked I think. Came with potatoes, asparagus and carrots. I didnt eat them.  I wouldve given this place 1 star. The extra star went to my waiter, Joel - who was absolutely attentive to my requests. The server though, didnt know where my crab legs were going - and walked right passed me. That just peeved me because I was waiting for the longest time.",

They also started having fish tacos, and the fish is nicely grilled and it comes with a side of guacamole.  Don't get the lobster because it's usually overcooked.  Service is great, the place is laid back, and it's a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the casino.",

BUT we wanted to try a variety of oysters so we ordered half dozen Oyster Grill which was grilled with parmesan butter ($14) and half dozen Oyster Royale which was raw oysters topped with chive creme fraiche and wasabi caviar ($14). When the oysters came out...Oh-my-God...both were really good. By far the best oysters I have ever eaten. You will know once you come here and try the oysters! I left speechless...it really was a party in my mouth!  Service is excellent! Really nice & friendly staff! Love them!  I will definitely be hitting up the oyster bar again whenever I am in Vegas!! I almost past this up because i had eaten so much right before coming here. I am so glad I came!

One time we went to the Oyster bar at Palace Station, only to find that kids are not allowed as it's a bar type of place, so we can't compare these 2 places.  This place allows kids, but being in the middle of a casino, the air quality is not very good (ie, cigarette smell).",

The same folks have been there for years and the recognize us when we come back, even after a year. Treat them right and they will be exceptionally nice. Last year we got a free risotto sample and this year it was shrimp ceviche and some soup.  Prices are reasonable for Vegas and service is prompt and friendly.

If you ate it with the small salad provided it was better (still nothing special). The Spicey grasshopper oyster was pretty good different if you want that. The fried potato encrusted shrimp were probably the best thing but could have benefited from some salt. Crab cakes were salty and mushy. We are used to our crab cake with lumps of crab. Don't expect that here. The crab cake did have a good sear but that did not make up for the mushy. The New England clam chowder had good taste to it but there was some weird snotty looking things in it. We inquired of the waiter what it was. He got real bad attitude. He never really answered he just blurted out I'll take it off.  Okay when you come to Vegas on vacation the last thing you want is a waiter with attitude. If you eat on the strip it's expensive. You should get an experience when you pay these prices to eat. In short I've eaten in a lot of places but I won't be going back. The food is just so so and I don't like the attitude.",

I looked over and the lady next to use had A huge dish of seafood with a cream sauce at the bottom and convinced us to try it. It's called Pan Roast OMG so good. I'm from Florida and I know seafood this is good seafood!!! But I think what mAde it so fun and a all around good expierence was our server Trent. Ask for his section. He's was at the oyster bar area when we were there.",

Watch the staff clean, ice the plate, add the horseradish, lemon half and cocktail sauce, shuck and place the oyster, then voila! They have an assortment of oysters and they probably give you mixture. Or if you prefer just one type, let them know. Had a couple sit by me and I guess they're regulars...with their order, it was a modified dish of oysters in a half shell and a oyster shot. Oysters were laid out as so perfectly prepared in a iced circular formation and the staff seasoned each half shell with a VERY GENEROUS amount of grey goose vodka! I can only imagine had good that was and how drunk I could have gotten.  Ordered the jambalaya with chicken and it was great! So filling. Chicken grilled and amazingly juicy and tender. The rice and sauce was just enough spice to tempt you for your next bite. Zesty without being overpowering. Loved the sausage...they were not overly salty or spicy, it was just right.  I almost wished I didn't have to go to the nightclub and just go home so I could have taken doggy bagged my jambalaya!",

The one off strip is insanely popular, so this was welcome to be close to the strip. It's at Harrahs which is across from Caesars and although the hotel isn't super popular anymore, this restaurant absolutely is. We didn't have a reservation and grabbed a seat at the bar within 5 minutes at 7pm on a Sunday. We love Oysters, and these do not disappoint. Get them fresh though as they are much better than their grilled counterpart. The Rockefeller Oysters did look amazing though and the person who got them was a big fan. We got the Clam Chowder which I think is a requirement because it's honestly the best I've had out of Boston. One of the regulars at this location hinted that we should ask for the \"Big Lobster\" which is 20oz, and comes with an optional steak. We went for lobster alone and WOW it's huge and delicious. Comes with a salad and some grilled veggies, but Joel offered us a side of creamy marinara pasta where he threw in some shrimp and it was the perfect complement. Loved it so much here and so easy to get a seat that we came twice on our 3 day trip.",

After asking the bartender, we seated ourselves in one of the vacant tables.  Waiter promptly asked for our drinks and orders without being called.  Our orders came less than 10mins after.  I'm impressed.  Clam chowder came first, then the calamari, then OB's pan roast and the Oyster Rockefeller as last.  Oh, they also have complimentary bread which I never tried.  Oyster Rockefeller  - Fresh oysters on the half shell with spinach, hollandaise sauce, parmesan, baked to order (apparently these oysters are flown in fresh daily).  This was a very, very good tasting dish.  The soup that came with tasted heavenly on my palate. Calamari  - lightly breaded, came with 2 sauces and sliced half lemon.  Tasted fresh New England Clam Chowder - tasted good OB's pan roast  - lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams and mussels, with smoke tomato cream sauce and jasmine rice ( loved this, very fresh tasting seafood) Also ordered 1 cocktail drink which I don't remember the name.  Price was reasonable considering Las Vegas' expensive bars and restaurants near the strip.  Paid total of $137 for all of these.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star was the noise level.   Kinda noisy (especially because of the noisy group right beside our table). I have to raise my voice (almost yelling) to be heard everytime I talk.",

I think he is also the cook for the panroast too. Anyways, it took him forever to get our water. The clam chowder also looked strange.... more pink than white. We ordered a dozen oysters as well and those were delicious.  SECOND experience- our waiter was Asian this time. Very prompt on our order and water. I tried the Caesar Salad this time and it was yummy. The clam chowder tasted A LOT better this time around- white, creamy, full of clams. The waiter also talked to us and recommended the Kusshi oyster and actually let us sample two different kinds of oysters. Needless to say, we ordered an extra dozen Kusshi oysters. Friendly service and samples= happy customers who order more food.",

It's not a well known spot, or at least, not in comparison to any other places that serve oysters. They have a pretty large menu and different selection of oysters at various prices. Every time I've been here, I've been more than satisfied. Oysters taste great, pretty fresh and they are a good size. It's Vegas priced so you can easily spend up and over $100 here between two people if you are really hungry or a huge seafood person.",

Ordered half dozen of the Rockefeller and the grilled oyster with garlic Parmesan butter, and a dozen of the Oyster Royale which was my favorite.  I prefer the colder preparation vs the baked/hot preparation.  On the Royale, they put creme fraiche and wasabi caviar.  Complimentary dinner roll and crispy bread are nothing to rave about.  Oysters are a good size.  I did get hooked up with an extra large one which was a little challenging to swallow.  A man sitting next to us looked on as I ungracefully chugged the thing down ... Perv!   I  want to give them four stars but the lack of cleanliness is really keeping me from doing so.   Came around 8pm on a Sunday and as we waited for a couple of spots to be \"cleaned\" at the bar, we watched the only bus boy's half ass attempt to knock off pieces of food particles and wipe menus down.  They're just too busy.  There's one waiter who is literally going around in circles doing his best to keep everyone satisfied.  It worked though as we were satisfied nonetheless while that weirdo got a free show.",

This 3rd time, unfortunately it was not a good experience.  The base was very thick with a bunch of tomatoes and very sweet. It was so thick we had to ask for more broth which was also thick. I was starving so I ate all the seafood and stayed away from the broth and rice.  I Spoke to the manager and he informed me every cook is different so it wont be the same everytime.  He apologized and offered free desert or free drink. I passed.  My question is if this is a higher end restaurant why would the food not be consistent?  Never again coming back to this location.  I will go to the Texas Station where it is consistent. Ive attached the pic below of the extra broth... Not the same consistency as the pictures you see in the other reviews",

Mink and Nadine seemed to have enjoyed the bread. We just came in for oysters so we ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell to share. For me, I thought it went best with their Iguana Gold \"Golden Habanero\" hot sauce. Oysters were ok and needed condiments to finish.   Mink was thirsty and wanted a virgin lava flow or something similar. They didn't really have nonalcoholic drinks on the menu aside from Red Bull, bottled water, soft drinks, coffee or tea. She didn't want any of those so we told our server. He talked to the bartender and they made her a virgin cocktail just for her. That's a half star bump up so 3.5 stars.",

It was terrible but having had the pan roast at the other location, pan roast should have had more flavor. The serving size is also smaller than Palace Station.

We chose a regular table and were served right away.  We got a dozen fresh oysters which were nice and plump!  The lemon juice and cocktail sauce made the taste pop!  Mmm!  This was a great snack on the way to riding the High Roller.  It was really convenient and we didn't have to wait like the Palace Station location which only has 18 seats!",

    "text": "Oyster Bar is located at Harrah's Casino.. Not to be mistaken with the Palace Station location which my opinion is way better than this location.   I was hoping for that spicy tomato broth bouillabaisse, however, the version at this Oyster Bar location is a clear seafood saffron broth. The soup it self is okay and lacks flavor and spice. It's filled with sauteed shrimp, scallops, lobster, mussels, clams, crab claws and fish. Seafood itself is good and enjoyable especially with that 1/2 lobster tail but the broth I didn't care for.   Service here was just okay. Waitress was nice and attentive. The hostess was a bit annoying. We arrived and she was fixing the sign up front and ignoring the fact we where standing next to her for a few minutes. She really wanted to finish up fixing a sign that could of waited to be fixed after we would be seated. Keep in mind, the restaurant seats were mostly empty.   Nothing beats the Palace Station location..",

OMG! All those dishes Raymundo made for me was super delicious as he takes pride of his owned cooking! I felt like I was home, a family member chef cooking my food at my liking!  This is definitely my favorite place to go now every time I visits Vegas because of this bar chef!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK",

There should be a negative stars option. I love oysters so my husband decided to take me to this establishment. We sat down and after 10 minutes I had to bug the lady lady who was shucking oysters and doing other busywork and asked her if we could order. She seemed surprised that no one had come by and she said \"I can grab bread, water and get your server\". Five minutes later he comes by and takes our order. We got our GRAINY  oysters pretty fast but my husbands beer took 15 minutes. The guys who sat down after us got their beers faster and they took notice and chimed in on how bad the service was and how it wasn't even busy. So my husband and I were done with our meal and still no beer. So I asked the lady to cancel the beer ( because of course we couldn't find our server). 5 minutes later the server comes with a beer. I told him we canceled it so he looked at the guys next to us and said \" Want a free beer, here you go\". Unbelievable!! The guys felt bad and gave us the beer. This guy turned me off from the oyster bar, and from Harrahs. I'll never go to either one again. I cant believe they would employ someone that seems like he hates his job. It could be worse, he could be a stripper. How he still has a job when there are better and more capable people blows my mind. Maybe he should look into doing magic shows since he's a server who likes to perform disappearing acts when he should be serving food.",

I usually don't eat seafood far from the ocean since I have a seafood allergy, but from the YELP reviews I went with everyone's review and took a zyrtec just in case my food allegy starts to flare up. Everything was fresh and service was prompt during lunch hour. A star off since the chowder was on the warm side.   They list on the menu that the sampler comes with brandied cocktail sauce, but there was a buttery concoction that came with our order and sparked my interest to dip cold seafood into it. It came with it for a reason, so order extra lemon aioli sauce that comes with the sampler platter. So good!",

We ordered the Neptune's Martini and a half dozen Rockefellers -- very impressive.  My wife doesn't normally eat raw oysters but she tried these, and said they were pretty good!  Some dude next to us ordered Rockefellers with chopped shrimp, spinach, crab meat and bacon!  We didn't know they customize orders, so we'll have to come back and try that one!  Dinner comes with free bread.  I, personally, would ask for just the flat bread.  It's so fresh and crispy!  I wanted more raw oysters so I ordered another half dozen.  Use caution when sampling the horseradish!  As Russell Peters would say... \"It's mind BLASTING!\"  We also ordered some Jambalaya w/ Chicken.  This was very tasty!  Their Andouille and Tasso was out of this world!  At this point we had to undo our belts a few notches, and we were ready to leave... but then, there they were... Crab Cakes!  This other couple also sitting at the bar ordered them, and we had to have them!  These were pure crab (no bread), perfectly spiced!  They were a little on the moist side, but otherwise very good!  The Remoulade was the perfect compliment!  TIP:  Try it with the flat bread!  With that, we called it a dinner and left... a few pounds heavier!  Definitely recommended!!",

Having excellent attentive service makes the dining a much better experience for all.   Must try the oyster shooter with I believe it's called Asian Bomb alcohol which is a mixture of sake and some other stuff which makes it taste so unique. It is soooo good!!! It will kick your butt without the alcohol taste. It's 3 for $12 I think but it's so worth it!!!   Oysters are fresh and delicious!! There's different kinds of oysters which Ly explained to us. I can't remember it of course, but there's a Japanese one and a southern one and blablabla. I tasted 2 different kinds and they were sooo good!! I love how it's already cut from the shell and ready to slurp. A must try!!!  Also tried seafood cioppino, shrimp appetizer, and steamed mussels. They were all very delicious as well. The shrimps are big here so it was really good. They put in some salsa-ish taste to the mussels while being steamed which makes it very juicy.   Great place to eat in Vegas if you're sick of the buffets. Definitely a must try in Vegas. The only problem you'll have is the price, but that's at any juicy oyster bar.",

Voila ... Oyster Bar!   We sat at the bar and Trent our server, who's been working there for 19 years was super fabulous.  His service was impeccable and really showed that he loves his job.   So I ordered the Grilled Oysters with Garlic-Parmesan Butter and Alaskan King Crab Cocktails....both hit the spot!  I came here for Oysters and even the crab legs did not disappoint.

What's this going to cost me??\" So I hopped on Yelp to find reasonably priced oysters. I found Oyster Bar and read Su K's review regarding the place being a good deal and I was sold!      We hit the door dressed up for a fab night out. We arrived at Oyster Bar around 10pm. I ordered a glass of prosecco and we ordered a dozen oysters. Oyster Bar carries 3 kinds of oysters on any given night, so we mixed the variety up. Actually, I let Mr. Hottie mix things up and I sat back and sipped my beverage!      The oyster quality was great! Some of the oysters were fresh and briny, others were soft and buttery. The freshness of each oyster was without question! We also ordered the mussels. Now I'm not a huge fan of mussels and these didn't win me over. They were a tad overcooked in my opinion; still the broth was full of flavor.      We sat at the actual bar of the restaurant and our waiter was attentive and talkative. He was also preparing the food behind the bar! He kept checking on our food and making sure we had everything we needed.      Oyster Bar is one of the best bargains I have seen in a while in Vegas. A dozen oysters were 20 bones with all condiments included. Was this a fancy seafood restaurant? No. It's a casual place to stop in, have a drink and have some fresh oysters before heading out for the evening! I will definitely be back to visit!",

My friends had a steamed mediterranian mussels, the Bourbon street jambalya, and shrimp scampi, they all said it was good, but not the type of amazing food that will knock your socks off. However, the service left much to be desired for these types of prices. The entire time we were there, the waiter never came to ask how we were doing, how the food was, if we had any issue, or even just to refill our water. The waiter was inattentive when we tried to flagg him down. Was curt, very unclear in telling us about the dishes. I felt that I was paying 4 star prices for a fast food experience.",

    "text": "\"Oyster- gasmic!\"  [First impression] Harrah has an oyster bar?  Indeed they do. And a pretty darn good one at that. We needed a light \"snack\" while strolling the Strip and decided to go for some oysters. When in the middle of the desert right? Why not! I was sold when I found out they had my favorite-- Fanny Bay. We decided to get a dozen mixed which is usually a great way to try a little bit of everything.   [Suggestion] *Avoid the temptation to get a dozen mixed oysters and go straight for the Fanny Bay. They are by far my favorite-- small to medium size, creamy and meaty.   [Tips] *Sit at the bar.",

    "text": "TL:DR: Decent food, but not worth it for the price tag.   We went there well before the dinner rush, and ordered fresh oysters, Manhattan seafood chowder, clams, surf & turf (king crab instead of lobster for $7 extra) and a sea bass special that was recommended by our waiter (not on the menu).  Appetizer:  The oyster is quite fresh, a nice start to our meal. However, when the seafood chowder is served, we were disappointed. The taste of the soup was really salty and overly saucy. I did not enjoy it at all. I had to chug water down after.   Entree: 1. Surf & Turf The steak is rather small (feels a little less than 4 oz.), and there's nothing special about it. It's just a classic filet mignon without any sauces. The steak was not rested for long enough before serving, so the juice was actually spilling out when it was served.  We substituted the king crab legs instead of lobsters, and there is nothing special about it. It's mediocre at best.   The sides (carrots & asparagus) are decent, but a bit on the greasy side.  2. Sea Bass  The fish is slightly over cooked, but the portion size is one fish. In my honest opinion, I don't think it's worth the price tag, but it is a nice change from the regular fish one can usually get served in a restaurant.   Post Entree Side: Clam cooked in white sauce It was quite delicious, but the portion size isn't overly big, so not quite worth the price in my opinion.",

I ordered a glass of Prosecco, and the pour was extremely generous. Almost filled up to the top. Yeah!

Then you probably are better off heading out to The Palace Station Oyster Bar with that gnarly, unreal reputation. I kid you not, that place is THE best when it comes to Pan Roast, Bouillabaise and all the sweet seafood simplicities, but the line is always marvelously long...  So come here if you want decent food without the wait. Just don't have those expectations. I personally was debating between the Pan Roast and the Bouillabaisse. After reading a lot of you fellow yelpers' reviews, and after talking to the chef at the bar, I chose what I was hoping for a lighter option: The Bouillabaisse. Now it was good, it came with a variety of bread, but it doesn't come with rice (that is extra $), just the pot. It was good, not gonna downgrade it... The seafood meat was hearty, with various yummies... But I would easily say my biggest disappointment is that it was a little too salty. I don't even want to know how the Pan Roast would have been like.  Would I come here again? As a seafood lover ABSOLUTELY. But it doesn't hold candle to the OG bar at Palace Station.",

No wait at all on a Saturday evening!   Flash Fried Calamari, $12- light and crispy outside with soft and chewy squid on the inside.    Fish n' Chips, $18- beer battered cod with fries and coleslaw.  Fish was okay, not amazing.  The fries were nice and crunchy!  I would skip this appetizer.  New England Clam Chowder, $7- don't be deceived by the size of the bowl.  It looks small but so darn filling!  The hubs wouldn't share his bowl with me so I got a bowl myself.  It sort of filled me up too much to enjoy the rest of dinner.  Generous amount of clams, very creamy and delicious!    Manhattan Clam Chowder, $7- I had a spoonful of my friend's chowder and it was good!  Different but good.  It tastes like a cross between minestrone soup and clam chowder.  Sort of weird but I liked it.    Bourbon Street Jambalaya, $23- smoked chicken with rice, andouille sausage, ham, and a \"zesty\" sauce.  The chicken was waaay overcooked, rice was too soft because it was drenched in the sauce and everything was very salty.  SKIP.  Jumbo Fried Oysters, half dozen, $17- the guys in our group wanted this.  I had a bite and it was okay.  You can taste the batter but not too much of the oyster.  Oysters on the Half shell, dozen, $24- yump!  So sweet and delicious!  I would come back here just to eat a dozen of these babies all by myself!  No sharing!    Bottomline:  A bit pricey but with our large group, everyone wanted something different.  Skip everything else and just order the fresh oysters and clam chowder!",

The gentleman behind the counter said he would get \"fired\" if he served us. We asked, your manager will fire you for bringing in more money and customers\"? He didn't seem to care so we left very disappointed to say the least. As much as we wanted to try your restaurant, considering the level of concern of eager patrons I don't think we will make another attempt to try to dine there.",

I arrived at 10pm and sat down at the bar and the chef told us they are closed. So as my wife and myself were walking out a waiter stopped us and told us it was okay for to take a seat. This was the highlight of our dinner.   We order the New England Clam chowder and  lobster bisque to start off our meal. They were both pretty bland. We also ordered a dozen oysters and they were actually really good and the price was reasonable. Our main course we had pan roast which wasn't a traditional pan roast that usually is a tomato base and a bit pricey. Honestly if you're on the strip this is the only place to go but if you're willing to drive to some of the other oyster bars around town definitely do so...",

Just seat yourself and the waiter will eventually come up to you to serve you.   came here with my boyfriend because i thought this was the other oyster bar and ordered the pan roast. i honestly didn't realize i was at the wrong oyster bar until i got my food LOL  we both ordered the pan roast because my sister in law raved about it. the pan roast initially didn't look filling to me, even though it was filled to the brim with seafood and a scoop or rice. it comes with this creamy tomato based sauce with a little kick of spice at the end. comes with a bunch of shrimp, mussels, clams, and half a lobster tail. even though the bowl of food didn't seem too filling, i honestly could not handle the monstrosity that is this dish. the dish itself was 30 something dollars, so only order it if you're hungry!  we also ordered a side of fries, which costs around $10 - $12. although it was a big portion, the fries were way too salty for both of our tastes. ended up not even finishing half of it. might have to ask for unsalted and then salt the fries yourself, if that's possible.  one thing i didn't like about oyster bar was the fact that there was only one waiter. it sucked to see one man running around taking care of almost 20 tables by himself. so don't forget to be patient!",

The soups in general taste like can soup that heated in the microwave. I didn't even finished it. I would rather to buy a supermarket can soup than ordered the $12 soup here. Gross.   The worst thing is the oysters. A dozen for $33 which I expected the oyster to be super good. But it was a disappointment. The oysters are small and some come with hard shell. Very disappointed. We haven't even got to our entree.  Worst $80 bucks we have ever spent. Never come again. Not recommended.",

    "text": "Yesterday we went to the Oyster Bar at Harrah's after checking out the menu on the computer, no prices were listed, so I called the Oyster Bar and asked the prices of a couple of items I thought we might enjoy.  I was quoted by an employee at the Oyster Bar that the Oscar Burger was $22, the Crab Louie Salad was $26 and the Seared Tuna Salad was $22.  So we decided to have dinner there (pre-birthday).  We parked at Harrah's (they charge you to park) and proceeded to the Oyster Bar.  Waiter came to the table and brought the menus and the prices were NOT WHAT THEY SAID TO US ON THE PHONE.   Now we are sitting there ready to eat and the Oscar Burger that was quoted at $22 now is $35.00, yes you read right $35 for a burger which has  3 asparagus with hollandaise sauce on it, crab meat and then the beef burger.  We decided to order because we had paid to park and there wasn't any where else to eat at Harrah's, their Buffet which I checked out looked terrible, and the Fulton Street Food Hall is even worst.  So we ordered the Oscar Burger and the Pan Seared Salmon which was $29.00.  We were trying to make the best out of a bad situation.   When the food came to the table, the Salmon wasn't much of a portion, plus 3 pieces of vegetables, but the OSCAR BURGER, which was the most expensive Burger I have ever eaten, where oh where was the Crab?? I found the asparagus 3 of them, the burger, no hollandaise sauce on it, but was that little piece of white fish the crab?  it was about an inch long and about 1/4 inch wide, was this the CRAB?  Asked for the burger medium well it came out pink!  Asked for a side salad instead of fries and wouldn't you think a salad has lettuce and tomatoes (per the waiter) in it?  No our salad had lettuce and red peppers!!!! Who wants red peppers on salad.   Also found in that little piece of crab a crab bone so that made the little we had even smaller.  Meat was dry even though it was pink, no special yummy flavor.  Actually a very bland tasting burger.  My goodness a $35.00 Burger and it was nothing special, it was meat, asparagus and a piece of crab (if you could find it).  Not worth the money at all, maybe if it had tasted special or looked fabulous we would have felt better.   This Oyster Bar is NOT good, price of food is misquoted by employees, and you most certainly don't get what you pay for.  Harrah's needs to bring their restaurants up to par because every restaurant has low quality food.  Be it the Buffet, the Fulton Street Food Hall or the Oyster Bar.  Very disappointed and never will return to Harrah's. If you want to enjoy a Oyster Bar there are quite a few on the Strip and off the Strip where you can go, unfortunately this is not one of them.  My check came to $64.00 for a Burger and Seared Salmon.  Ridiculous!!!!!   Plus the fact that we were hungry about an hour later and stopped for pizza before going home.",

They had a full drinking bar with the oysters and seafood laid out in cold ice on one side, which happened to also lead into the kitchen on the other side. Surrounding tables laid out around. We sat at the hightop bar.  My date and I ordered two platters. One the charbroiled oysters and two raw oysters. Extremely fresh and great tasting. Each platter came with a dozen oysters and our bill came out to about $60. Pricey for a snack. However, we had a great meal here! We didn't get to try the other dishes but that's on my checklist for next time. Yelp photos of the hot dishes looks mouth watering.",

    "text": "TLDR; extremely good steam kettle pan roast. I suggest coming at odd hours in order to avoid waiting for a seat.   I really love this place but it's so small it's better to come at odd hours. We came Sunday at 8am and we managed to snag some seats. It's literally just a countertop that can fit maybe ~15 people at a time. During prime hours, the line isn't long compared to other places but it takes awhile because of how little seats there are.   I've only had the Pan Roast here but I'd imagine everything else on the menu is good too. They give you bread to dip and you can ask for more if you want it.   There were three of us and we split a single serving of the Pan Roast along with an extra side of rice. All the pieces of seafood tasted fresh and the cream sauce wasn't too much...tasted really good eating it with rice and bread.   I highly recommend giving this place a try! It is pricey and the wait can be long but the food is worth it.",

We ordered as appetizer the \"Oyster Bar Cold Seafood Platter for two\" which was about $79. It came with an assortment of lobster, shrimp, mussels, oysters & crab legs, served with a brandied cocktail sauce. The shrimps were huge. I got kind of full from this appetizer. As for food we ordered the Lobster Bisque which was a creamy tomato base topped with fresh lobster. Absolutely amazing! It was perfect for the weather Vegas was having during that time. We also ordered a Crab Louise salad. It was good & they give you a lot. Topped dinner off with a blue moon.   Service was a little slow but the staff was friendly.",

We sat on the bar and there were two lady's standing by the oysters that were speaking Spanish and doing nothing productive.  It became so uncomfortable for us watching the people in the kitchen running around trying to cook and take orders all while these two ladies stood there and giggled about whatever. It turns out they were the ones in charge of shucking the oysters but if there wasn't an order they stood there and did absolutely nothing.  This obviously isn't my restaurant or my business but I really wanted to tell them to at least go stand in the back where nobody could see them.  I asked the cook/server and he didn't say anything but his body language spoke volumes.  There was a lot of frustration and as i mentioned, it made us feel very uncomfortable.  At one point another person came out and joined the conversation so for about 20 minutes there were 3 women standing there doing nothing as everyone else was hustling around trying to take care of the customers.  We were there for over an hour and half eating and then having some delicious cocktails and the ladies were there the entire time.  We'll go back for the food but if those ladies are standing there again, we'll go elsewhere.",

Even better than your local starbucks.  Anyways...on to the meal.  The oysters (both raw and fried) came our perfect.  I like my raw oysters really cold and that's how they served em.  The raw ones came out crunchy yet light.  The crab was cooked perfectly, not overly cooked and dried out.  I'd recommend you go see Trent and Ly at night and they'll treat you to a great experience!",

If you want more of a sit down atmosphere and do not feel like standing up for hours in line, this is definitely an alternative.  And especially if you are going  with a big group just like we were during this visit.    We ordered- Pan roast, ofcourse, which included, lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams, mussels, smoked tomatoes sauce and jasmine rice. 4 stars   Bouillabaisse-sauteed shrimp,, scallops lobster, mussels, clams, fish in seafood saffron broth. 5 stars   Grilled rib eye, medium well dressed with potatoes and  grilled asparagus.  5 stars   Jumbo fried oyster. 5 stars.  Jumbo shrimp cocktail .  3 stars (over priced ) skip this.  Chicken salad.  3 stars.  Classic shrimp scampi pasta.  4 stars  Flavors were good but my all time favorite is the one located at Palace Station.    Happy grubbing!",

    "text": "First and foremost, let me just tell you now - this (probably) isn't the droid...I mean, oyster bar that you're looking for.  The famed one with thousands of reviews and wait times that can go on for hours would be \"The Oyster Bar\" inside the Palace Station hotel off The Strip.  This place is \"Oyster Bar\", located inside the Harrah's hotel on The Strip and owners of (only) hundreds of reviews and zero wait times.  Far more convenient, to be sure, but definitely not the one that everyone raves about!  Now, in case you were wondering, no...I didn't end up here because I thought it was somehow related to The Oyster Bar, which I've had bookmarked for the longest time.  Rather, it was purely by chance, as my coworkers chose to come here for a late dinner for our team meal.  Not that I didn't wish they were sister restaurants, as it might have saved me a trip out to Palace Station.  In any case, Oyster Bar's menu is nothing to scoff at either - it's got plenty of interesting things to offer as well!  With a ton of stuff ranging from the light (oysters, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, fried calamari, tuna sashimi, lobster bisque, clam chowder, salads) to the heavy (jambalaya, crab legs, lobster tails, fish & chips, lobster tails, cioppino, shellfish boil, pan roasts), there's no shortage of seafood-centric dishes to choose from.  Since I wasn't hungry enough for their larger dishes (and too hungry for their small ones), I opted to go with their LOBSTER ROLL ($28) with Poached Atlantic Lobster Tail tossed in Lemon Aioli and served with Old Bay Seasoned Fries.  Although it didn't look all that impressive when it first came out (the bun could've fit more lobster), this wasn't bad.  While it was a little heavy on the aioli, the lobster was actually decently fresh and flavorful.  What's more, I was pleasantly surprised by how the bread wasn't dried out.  As for the fries, they're obviously not the star, but that didn't make them any less disappointing - the Old Bay seasoning was nice, but I wish the fries were crispier.  Beyond the food, Oyster Bar might be worth a visit if only for their drink menu.  Not only do they have a healthy selection of cocktails, beers, and wines to choose from, but their bar is well stocked with liquors and spirits as well!  At the very least, you can enjoy a solid drink or three while you're stopping in for a bite (I only had a beer, but my coworkers seemed to thoroughly enjoy their cocktails/mixed drinks).  All in all, based on the one thing I had, I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed when I left.  However, this review could've easily gone differently had I ordered something else (my coworkers' dishes all looked tasty).  In either case, I can't say how this compares to the legend that is The Oyster Bar.  So, until I do, and despite how Oyster Bar has the potential to be pretty good in its own right, you can find me waiting in line at Palace Station the next time I'm in town now that I've had a taste of their competition.",

I let the server know and it was replaced immediately with two extra ones for the trouble! Not a bad way to gain a loyal customer. The place is a bit pricey, but you are on the Strip in Vegas, so that's to be expected. Service is efficient and friendly, I sat at the actual bar so it was quick as well. This is a nice place to rest your weary bones and enjoy some top notch seafood after walking the Strip all day. Definitely worth stopping in for!! next time I'm trying the rawzy's with caviar and creme fraiche, and the grilled oysters, they both looked amazing!!!",

    "text": "Celebrating my winning college football and NFL bets, we decided to reward ourselves here!  Harrah's pretty much only offers their Flavors Buffet, Toby Keith's Bar & Grill, Fulton Street Food Hall, Ruth's Chris, and the Oyster Bar.  And if you're craving seafood, I would totally choose this place over their buffet.  Here's what I enjoyed:  ~ Crabby Mary!  My refreshing starter!  The kicker to this drink was the blue cheese-stuffed olives.  I'm a blue cheese lover so I savored this one.    ~ Flash-fried Calamari ($13):  An excellent tasting appetizer!  You can't mess up calamari or I'll never give a place a second chance.  These squid pieces were lightly breaded and quickly deep-fried.  They were soft and crunchy!  They also went well with the spicy marinara and lemon-caper aioli, mmm!  My only complaint was, there was not enough tentacle pieces.  I wanted more tentacles!  What gives?  ~ O.B.'S Pan Roast ($34):  A serving for one, my bowl of seafood and rice filled me up!  It came with half a lobster tail, about five good sized shrimp, two crab claws (appeared to be dungeness), a few mussels and clams, all drowning in a flavorful tomato cream sauce.  I LOVED THIS BOWL OF SEAFOOD!  It had a bit of everything except oysters lol.    Surprisingly, I didn't try their oysters, and I don't know why.  But with all the reviews about oysters, people seem to simply rave about them.  I'll definitely try them next time.    As far as service, our servers were on-point.  Our waiter kept following up, refilled our water glasses, and the busy busboy cleared out several dishes to make room for more.    The dining wasn't super elegant, but clean and typical with white linen tables inside and tall bar tables along the outside.  I like it here, and I felt it was well worth it!  I'll be back, as I heard the cioppino and seafood risotto dishes are also popular choices.",

They have bar and low and high table seating and you seat yourself. Although this is an oyster bar, they have a variety of appetizers and entrees. We ordered the half dozen raw oysters $23, Cajun Scallop $31, Lobster Roll $28, and 8 oz Lobster $35. They also provided a complimentary bread bowl.  There was no choice available for the raw oysters, so I think it's whatever oyster of the day. I want to emphasize that EVERY DISH WAS DELICIOUS. The Cajun Scallop on risotto had 5 huge scallops and a bunch of scallops in the rice. The risotto was creamy and heaven with each bite.  I can't wait for the chance to return. Despite the price, the food is worth it.",

Although we were seated immediately, the service was terrible. For a Friday night, there was only one server and he was struggling to accommodate everyone. I got the pan roast for two and shared with my sister. It was rice served with lobster, shrimp, crab, clam, tomatoes and mussels in a creamy sauce. I think the dish was $40-50 and I highly recommend it. So filling and delicious. I also got to try the clam chowder which was tasty and a small filler if you're not super hungry.",

I kept thinking to myself - Is this The Best Jambalaya I've EVER Had?! I've never even considered asking a question like that since the last time I've visited New Orleans 10yrs ago - which to me is the best food Anywhere! But This Jambalaya Here has me needing another trip to Louisiana to double-check! It's easily the best Jambalaya I've had outside of the Big Easy, but it's maybe the best period!

My favorite seafood in Vegas, I have been to plenty of high end expensive restaurants in Vegas and honestly for the price and amount of food we ate I can say I enjoyed it here a bit more than the super upscale places. We came in for Super Bowl day around 2:30 and it was empty, we sat at the bar area and we were served quickly. Being our first time we didn't know what to order so I yelped a few suggestions, we ended up going with the lobster dish for 2 and half a dozen oysters. It was enough for us. The spices in the dish were just right/ the oysters are opened and cleaned in front of you and they are 100% fresh!. I will definitely come back here again. The staff is friendly and we had good conversations with people around us including the staff serving us. Super fun and delicious! I highly recommend trying this small restaurant out. Even for a quick bite or ordering to go. - amount spent about 100$ including drinks - clean restaurant  -staff is attentive -bread is served while you wait -total time spent here 1.5 hours",

They have plenty of different seafood options as well as steaks, etc.    I've have the Mussels Fra Diavolo and the grilled Lobster tail.  YUM!  They also have a pretty decent wine list to go along with their food options.  Another plus is that it is self-seating.  You just walk in and plop yourself down and find something delicious.

    "text": "Oysters on the half shell, grilled oysters, oysters rock, clams, clam chowder, rib eye, split lobster tail.  Not one food complaint from our group.  The oysters were fantastic, the rib eye tender, the lobster succulent, clams were tasty.  Our only complaint was that we were seated, and never got service for 15 minutes until one of our party finally walked up to the bar and told them.  After that we were promptly served for the rest of our meal.  It would have been 5 stars for other than the service.  Note that this place is NOT cheap.  It's on average about 25$ for a dozen oysters.  You can certainly find them cheaper off the strip, and at various happy hours around the area, but we wanted a place we could walk to from where we were staying.  Our party of 5 racked up a 202$ bill for food and drinks w/o tip.  Some times ya just gotta splurge!   We went here the first day of a 4 day stay and I dreamed about these oysters the last 3 nights.  Yes they were that good, and I've had oysters from WA to CA to FL to ME.  These stand up to any I've ever had.",

By the end of my trip - they were just whipping up things for us to try. Amazing.  All of their fish, tastes great - not chewy and rubbery, or salty. Their soups and appetizers were great too, very delicate tasting (even though they're made in gigantor.. attached to the floor.. type pots), and their oysters called out to me almost every night I was in Vegas.  If I ever go back, I will definitely make sure to pop back here!",

    "text": "First of all, really decent prices for the strip. Not extremely break a hole in my pocket expensive but definitely not cheap either. C'mon now, you're on the strip and you know what to expect people!  We had a little trouble finding this BAR hiding in Harrah's casino. It's an actual bar where you seat yourself. The tables are really small and the plates are all huge = problem.  We sat down on a round bar table near the bar/entrance and a waitress came over in about 1 minute. NICE! She was definitely helpful and extremely friendly, good service. There was 4 of us, all guys and two of us already had beers so we were sippin' a little bit already and were looking to continue our buzz!   We both got the Oyster shooter, comes with a double shot of Patron or Grey Goose and half-dozen fresh half-shell oysters. Of course we got Patron, and our waitress even noted that they dose a little bit of Patron on each Oyster too! Maybe that's what made it so good!!! They were extremely cold served on the bed of ice and tobasco/cocktail sauce and lemon!!! Extremely delicious!! Can you say \"Gone in 60 seconds!?!\" And the shot of Patron was huge, the only bad thing was that only 2 out of 4 of us were a lil drunk by the end of dinner.  We also got the Crab Cakes and Calamari. The crab cakes were good, very meaty and full of crab meat. I would've liked them to be a little fluffier but they weren't bad. Nothing outstanding either... the siracha aioli was delicious though, and the spring mix salad it was served on was gone in seconds. The Calamari was really good!!! Extremely crisp and good pieces, came out in a good sized fryer basket and there was even leftovers, after 4 guys dugg in on it!  Our friends ordered some type of Clam Pasta and Halibut with Risotto, they said it was okay...  All in all really enjoyed the visit here, definitely will return next time we're all in Vegas!",

    "text": "When a friend brought up hitting the oyster bar at Harrah's, that he saw an ad for on the way in from the airport, I smirked, and thought he was a fool.  I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience.  The cooks double as your service staff and are honest.  And very kind... For being cooks, I was shocked at how nice they actually were.  I guess tips help... If you ask them what's fresh, they give you honest answers - more than any service staff could every dream of, since servers don't handle the product themselves   The oysters we had were great, and fresh.  The clam chowder was one of the best I've ever had. Chunky with clams and potatoes, flavorful, and delicious.   The steamers were awesome.  This place really impressed me, and I will plan on going back when I head into Vegas again - It'll be a great place to drown my sorrows from losing at the tables.  I'll kill my pain with fresh seafood, and white wine.   Also, quite affordable - So yea... Great place to forget those losses",

When we arrived, it looked like a place where you get in and get out. Nothing fancy smancy.    We were not served oysters at the buffet. Thus, we set out for oysters the following night. We all ordered a dozen small raw  oysters. I ordered mines half raw, half fried. The raw oysters were very fresh and tasted delicious with the usual lemon juice and tabasco/tapatio. YUMMM. They were decent sized. Some were smaller than the average. When my fried oysters came out, they used the medium sized oysters. They were huge. I was not sure how I was gonna finish everything. It came with a nice creamy orangy sauce that tasted like horse radish mixed with thousand island. I am not sure. I cannot identify the taste to be exact. But all you need to know is that it is a good complimentary to the fried oysters. It came with some salad.     Overall, my friends and I were satisfied with the food.     The service on the other hand was a bit slow. We did not come at a busy time, it was moderate. It took awhile for them to take our order.",

First we had to sit ourselves  which OK maybe it's early and they don't have a hostess at around 2pm. One person took our drink order and another took our food order, and it came out fairly good time. That was the last time we saw someone come to our table, no one came to refill our drinks or asked us if we wanted more mixed drinks and we were willing to get more and they weren't cheap. After we were done my wife and sister got tired of waiting for our check so I told them to go to casino and kill some time and I will wait, well after 10 mins someone finally asked if I needed anything and I said yes my check please, well it took another 10 min before I even got it. During that time never did anyone apologized for the wait even after I told the person who finally got my check which was not even the original guy who helped us. We could of walked out   skipping out on the bill, and it was possible because no one was around us to serve us, but I'm a good person and paid my $113 bill. I'm a very patient person but I would like someone to contact me because I've been in the  customer service industry since I was 15 and I've never giving or received this kind of service before.",

    "text": "No joke, I would eat here every night if I could. We had a gift certificate so we ordered everything the chef recommended....quite literally. There was also a nice couple next to us that gave suggestions however I have a feeling this is one of those places that no matter what you order is amazing. You literally sit on the periphery of the kitchen so you watch all the lovely bumbling pots of shrimp, clams, oysters and the sizzling of steaks sets the stage for the cacophony of kitchen sounds. The experience on a whole was a delight of the senses. We started with Oyster Royale- the oysters tasted very fresh and I loved the wasabi roe and cream, the oysters were briney and fresh, some of the best I think I've had in a while ( I LOVE oysters!), then we had a cold seafood platter that was chocked full of tiger prawns, crab legs, lobster tail, and more OYSTERS!, the hubs got a steak (because he is a beef junky) which was cooked rare to his liking and I got a muscle pot of gold...I can't exactly remember what the name was but it had a roasted tomato sauce that was superb. I started with a bloody mary and then I had a martini sooooo yes remembering what I ate past the oysters is a bit hard, but eh it's Vegas Baby. Writing this review makes me want to plan a trip specifically so I can eat oysters again. If you are a fan of \"in kitchen dining\" and like oysters you should try this place for sure.  I am a very picky seafood eater, and have had oysters so fresh I've pulled a live baby crab from my mouth (oyster's last meal) so I know fresh seafood when I eat it.",

There is a number of \"Oyster Bars\" that are located in \"station\" casinos and a few in other casinos including Harrahs. I've visited the one in Palace Station right of the strip a few months ago and was so happy with them that when i went back i wanted to eat there again but chose Harrahs because it was closer to where i was Staying.  My boyfriend and I got there, there was no one there to greet us so we decided to take our own seats at the bar. Which by the way, every other Oyster Bar i have been by has a huge line just to be seated and this one was so empty.. i should have taken the hint.. Anyways, So finally sitting and not being noticed for 7 minutes someone lady comes up and asks us for our drink order. We ordered and then let her know we were ready to place a food order and she told us \"ok, let me go get someone..\"    So we waited again, a chef came up took out appetizer order and walk away without asking if we wanted anything else.   My Dozen oysters on a half shell comes and just looking at it i was so sad.. They were the wimpiest looking oysters I've ever seen in my life. For me to Pay that much for what i got was not right. On top of that my drink had been empty for 10 minutes and i had to ask someone to get me another soda which that person asked another person to get me one.   The Couple Sitting next to us also was so unhappy with their meal (they also have visted another \"Oyster Bar\" and knew how the experience was supposed to be)  that they asked the Head Chef to come over and they explained how unhappy we all were and the Chef replied with a \"ahuh ahuh, ok...\" No apologies, no \"ok let me make it up to you\" or no \"let me comp something\".    And on top of that the whole staff was gossiping, rubbing each others backs, yelling across the room. Very unprofessional.  So I tell you again.. DO NOT GO HERE!",

    "text": "I read very ugly views of this restaorante, whenever I've gone to Vegas there I have to visit, it makes me sad that people spend a lot of money on slot machines, and lunch will be expensive all, I ordered lobster 2 days straight and exquisite, my friend ordered oysters and liked too, the service was excellent, and of course we went back for that, would not change a line of expensive lobster for one of lesser quality, for nothing, the restaoante was full and had frequent reservations because people do not want to go to the buffet as they took to the waitresses, and attention is not what you deserve as a customer.                                                    he leido opiniones muy feas de este restaorante,siempre que he ido a las vegas ahi tengo que visitar,me da tristeza que las personas gastan mucho dinero en las maquinas tragaperras,y a la hora de comer les sea caro todo,yo he pedido langosta 2 dias seguidos y exquisito,mi amigo pidio ostras y le gustaron tambien,el servicio fue exelente,y claro que volvimos por eso ,no cambiaria una cola de langosta costosa por una de menor calidad,por nada,el restaoante estuvo lleno  y tenia reservaciones frecuentes,pues las personas no quieren ir al buffet ya que quitaron a las camareras,y la atencion ya no es lo que uno merece como cliente.",

I don't know if it was just my order, but the calamari was so tiny, I couldn't taste it. It was like eating batter by itself. Which is a shame because the sauces that came with the calamari was good. Had an order of the steamed clams (in some sort of sacue) and that was okay too.  Would come back for the oysters, but wouldn't order the calamari again.",

The $15 margaritas were a sickening sweet mix served over ice.  The fried calamari had no flavor, the \"risotto\" was inedible.  One does not merely squeeze a few globs of rice into a cream soup and declare it risotto.  The lobster portion had turned--I spit it out, hoping it doesn't make me ill.  The meal was removed from my bill, but I wasn't aiming for a free meal, I wanted a decent meal.",

    "text": "This was difficult to rate, the food was awesome, the service was horrible.  We sat down at the bar, the menu is a plastic placemat so we didn't have to wait for that.  Everything else was a wait.  We sat for  minutes before we were acknowledged at all.  Then the cook/sever came over to see what we wanted.  We both ordered clam chowder, which we never saw.  I also ordered the Flash Fried Shrimp, my honey ordered fish and chips.  We could see others with a bread basked including yeast rolls and crisp flat bread, but we were not offered any.    My shrimp came out piping hot - 4 huge tiger shrimp with a light tempura batter.  It was served with a spring mix salad, perfectly dressed with a light but flavorful dressing.  I heard several diners comment on how much they enjoyed the salad.  The aioli served with the shrimp was tasty, but I prefer cocktail sauce.  I had to wait to catch someone to ask for it.  Now, this is an oyster bar, so it's not like there is no one around, they just won't look at you so you can ask them for anything.  i was going to ask for cocktail sauce and a bread basket, but he took off so fast I could only get out the cocktail sauce.  He plopped that down and disappeared, and I had to ask the oyster schucker for a bread basket.  She tried to ignore me as well, but finally turned after about four \"ma'ams.\"  The cracker like flatbread had seasame seeds and was great! I could only eat 3 of the 4 shrimp, but they were wonderful.  My husband's fish and chips was hot and flakey, also lightly battered.  It was served with a small cup of cole slaw.  In the end we had to ask for the bill and wait for the cook/server/casheier to finish his conversation with some other patrons before he rang us out.  I should mention (since this is an oyster bar) that the folks that had oysters around us RAVED about the oysters.  They were offering 3 different varieties, and it looked like earlier in the evening they may have had more.  A man sitting next to us had worse service than we did, the server forgot his order entirely - twice.  We ended up laughing with him about how utterly bad the service was.  Such a shame, since this could be a knock out spot based on the food.  The menu has a good variety for dinner items at a pretty good price for the quality.  Just expect to have to flag down a server and wait a lot.",

    "text": "After our EDC trip, my boyfriend and I did not feel like eating anything. We wanted something small but nothing too heavy and filling. Not sure if it is a good idea to eat raw food after a day of not eating and a night of drinking, but we wanted oysters. As we walked up to the counter, we can smell the fishiness of the oysters. It was around 1pm and we were expecting a lot of people, but there were only about 4-5 families around us. We sat at the bar; right in front of where the chef would pry open the shells. At first, we stood in front of the bar, waiting for a waiter or someone to help us. We ended up getting fed up, so we just sat down. Nobody came to neither take our order nor offer us anything to drink. After 10 minutes, I started too waved down one of the chefs and he finally took our order. We ordered the half dozen Salsa half shelled oysters for $18. All I can say is, not worth it! I rather go to boiling crab, even though it is not as fresh the one here. But honestly, it tasted the same. Yes, the oysters were fresh and the salsa made it extra flavorful and it did take away the fish stench. But for $18, I was expecting a POW in my mouth. Nothing happened. Lame... We downed everything within 5 minutes...took another 10 to wave down someone to get us our checks. Bam $21 total...and we booked.  Next time, if I do come back, I would probably just order some clam chowder or calamari.... (the family next to us ordered them and they looked and smelled good)",

    "text": "This isn't by any means a high-end seafood experience, but it's in the Harrah's so I wasn't going into it with high expectations anyway.  The seat-yourself aspect of going into the place was a little confusing and the service furthered that confusion. After a good while of sitting at the high tables facing the casino, one server brought in the bread and said she'd take our order but then turned around and left saying there was a \"shift change.\" Once we got the right server sometime later, we ordered the Oysters Rockafeller, Jumbo Fried Oysters, Seafood Risotto, and the Lobster Ravioli as an appetizer.   Everything came out at the same time, so whatev on the appetizer. The ravioli was reportedly good. The oysters were my order; the fried oysters were better than the Rockafeller, but was still a pretty simplistic dish. It was only good in the way that anything fried is good. The Rockafeller dish was alright; I've had better at home in Washington for less. They were a little gritty.. I definitely got my calcium dose for the day in shell bits. I recommend putting on the Tapatio hot sauce that was conveniently on the table for those.   The seafood risotto was alright but my fiance wasn't thrilled about having to de-shell every mussel, every shrimp and lobster tail for that dish.  The food quality gives this review it's 3 stars; only to be topped by real coastal restaurants with fresh seafood coming in daily. The service was lackluster but not the worst I've seen in Vegas. Situated right in the middle of the casino, it offers a great view of the usual tenants at Harrah's: hardened casino grandma's hovering over the slot machines.",

Guaranteed fresh, what more can you ask for?   The Seafood Risotto was $26, and really made for sharing. There's tons of seafood in it... Huge shrimp, lobster, clams, and scallops - all cooked to perfection. It was awesome. Not at all chewy and bland, like I expected, given the location and price. I was so impressed.  The clams in broth were good as well, but when I come back... it's all about the oysters and seafood risotto. Harrah's... who knew?",

So, when wandering around to get to the monorail, I notice this place, and we planned to get some more oysters prior to dinner at the NYNY.  So, we stopped here on Tuesday night, around 6:30 pm. There are plenty of places to sit at the bar. We sit down and we already know what to order - a full dozen of raw oysters. They were shucked right in front of us. What a great deal!  The service was very helpful and cheerful. The oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty.   The casino Harrah's is a dump - but this place is really a gem amongst crap. Go here for the Oyster bar (and the monorail). We will return here when we come back to Vegas. Thanks to this place - I'm hooked on raw oysters. Yum Yum. Thank you!",

Somehow GPS led us here instead of the other one we really wanted to go to- I mean it wasn't bad- but when you were expecting a pan roast with creamy sauce and instead you get a jambalaya looking thing you are a little bummed. Their version of pan roast is completely different and it wasn't until the food came out that I realized we were at the wrong place! No wonder there was no line! However, I must admit I really liked how they sliced the lobster pieces in half so it was easy to eat. :)",

Make sure to add pasta because the sauce from the pan roast is really good with on the pasta!  A friend had the Bouillabaisse, which everybody thought tasted very bland.  I would not recommend getting this.  Another friend I believe had the classic shrimp scampi.  Once he got back to the hotel, it all came out the other end, undigested.  Same with another friend who had a bite of that same plate scampi.  Probably should avoid this dish as well.  The server seemed to be annoyed with us at the beginning for whatever reason.  At the time (around 5pm), there were only us (party of 8), and a party of 3, so the server's not swamped with work or anything.  We asked 3 times for a refill of bread (hungry drunk people), and it was never brought to us.  The server also made a mistake by ordering an extra pan roast, rather than the Bouillabaisse.  He allowed us to keep the pan roast though for free while he fixes his mistake.  All in all, -1 for annoyed server even though we weren't at all rude, and -1 for giving two of our party the runs.",

If you sit at the bar, you can watch them prepare and cook your meal.  The oysters a really fresh.  The raw ones are shucked in front of you--they're delicious!  There are also a few ways that they prepare the cooked ones.  I really like their version of oysters rockerfeller.  The Oyster Bar always has white and red clam chowder daily.  I personally prefer the red.  It's very tasty with lots of bits of clams.  My friends get the white version, and they say it's really good too.  For the entrees, over the years, I've probably tried everything on the menu, and it's all good.  Although, there are small differences depending on who actually cooks your food.  We've been regulars for years, and personally, we really like to sit with Dennis.  He's really nice and personable, and his cooking is terrific.  The surf and turf with the steak and lobster is one of their signature entrees.  It comes with potato wedges which are so delicious!  I also really like their bouillabaisse--get it with pasta and you have instant seafood linguine.  The jambalaya is awesome too.  I think that the only thing that was so-so was the catch of the day.  We've gotten it several times, and it always underwhelms.  The portions are pretty big, so we never have space left for dessert!",

First visit, we sat at a table. Sat for maybe almost 15 minutes and no one came by to take our order or even bring us water. So my husband asked the waiter to help us and the waiter quickly told us to just go sit at the bar because they will assist you better. Well why couldn't he have told us all those time we were waiting? So We went to the bar area. Finally got our order in. Honestly their food is really good here and I think I would come back despite the horrible service.  2nd visit, we just went straight to the bar area and order some oysters to eat and have some drinks. We didn't have to deal with the wait but the service was still crappy.  3rd visit, we went with a few of our friends. We each ordered appetizers and entrees. Appetizers of course came out first. Calamari was nasty here. Then our entrees  very slowly came out one by one. The waiter never came by to give the status on my order. I ordered pasta and my friend had steak and the steak came out first. 20 minutes passed by and my friends had finished their food and everyone was ready to leave and then my pasta finally came out. Instead of having my friends wait for me, I asked if he could box it up or just cancel my order because honestly I thought they had forgot my food anyways. The waiter walked away pissed off and came back with a box and an attitude. LOL. Places like this don't deserve any tips from me. There was no apology or anything.   Even with my bad experiences here, I am certain I will come back for their yummy food.",

    "text": "Its a little hidden gem if you like reasonable seafood on the strip.   It somehow gets lost in the hullabaloo of all the other places.  Loved the tuna sashimi, fresh, clean, high quality tuna.   Tried both soups and they were a bit oversalted but most people probably dont notice.  The crab cake was great.   They have a nice selection of hot sauces on each table and that makes for some fun dipping and tasting.  I do like to see what others get and talk to others about their food.   The Pan roast was loaded, loaded with seafood.  Might be nice if they could have a spicy option added to that choice.   I assume they have better choices for dessert than the Key Lime.  Was sort of a cheesecake combo and that didnt work for me.  Good thing I dont eat a lot of dessert but I do try stuff.  Ill come back and try some more.",

The best ones were the Oysters Rockafeller and the Oysters Royale.  They are a bit pricey but they tasted fresh.  The clam chowder was also delicious.

The service was non existent; after we ordered our oysters ( there  was only one option, and no description) we decided it wasn't even worth paying for any more food. So we paid and left.   The oysters were shucked poorly, the cocktail sauce was more like ketchup and when we asked for oyster forks (because they definitely didn't bring any) we got \"but why\" look. Oysters were average, but cost $32.00 a dozen.",

The waiter however was another story and was very snarly. My friend and I ordered the oyster Rockefeller to start which was good, however when I requested Tabasco sauce, the waiter walked off saying that \"horse radish is plenty spicy.\" So I called him back over and requested it again and with a few crackers. He walked off mumbling before bringing the hot sauce and a whole pantry full of saltine crackers. -____- We then ordered the pan roast for two which was a little too sweet for my taste but still good. He brought one spoon for a pan roast for two, checked on us once and would walk away before we could reply or request. The food was good but it doesn't make up for the service at all. He had a real attitude and it made the dining experience tense and less enjoyable.",

It was just hard for me to enjoy it because I absolutely HATE smoking, and the smell from the smokers in the casino emanates throughout the restaurant.  We ordered a bunch of oysters, mostly blue point. It depends on what kind of texture you like...fat oysters? Skinny oysters? Ask your server and they'll come up with something to your liking.  The oyster shooters were good! And they had sake, which was an interesting flavor.  I also recommend the clam chowder! So piping hot and tasted like it came from New England.",

I was expecting something plump, but these were so small it was laughable had it not costed me $30.  We showed up about an hour before closing, so I guess I can see why they were so small; they probably served all the good oysters already.  The clams were okay and I wouldn't consider the jambalaya  to be anything too great. It was really \"wet\" because of all the tomatoes.   The only good thing they had was probably their clam chowder soup. That's pretty much it however.",

Upon getting seated at the bar, we looked at the menu and was surprised at the prices. But what the hell, we're here to have a good time so let's hope that this is worth the money.   Ohhhh yeah it was. We ordered a dozen of oysters  for $28 (back home in Texas, it's about $12-$14 a dozen.) I chose the 1/2 lb of blackened shrimp ($19) and my best friend chose the Bouillabaisse ($34 I think) which was assorted seafood like clam, crab, mussel, shrimp in a saffron broth. The item we liked the least was the Boullabaisse bc it lacked flavor but the oysters and shrimp totally made up for it. Honestly wished I had gotten a lb of the blackened shrimp because it was so good. And the oysters were big and super clean. Probably the best oysters we've ever had and everywhere we go to, we get oysters.   Would recommend this place! Worth the money! Left full & satisfied!",

    "text": "This place was hit or miss.  When it was on, it was on, but the misses were significant.  My buddy and I ate here for lunch upon arriving into town on a Thursday afternoon.  There were only 2 other tables with diners, so we were immediately seated.  After ordering our drinks, we perused the menu.  It was an Oyster Bar, so I was expecting some New Orleans beers like Abita or Blackened Voodoo Lager.  No dice, it was all pretty basic stuff.  They have a full bar, so we had cocktails.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  No complaints there.  I went with the New England (the only kind) clam chowder and the parmesan crusted halibut.  The soup was good, it had nice big chunks of clam and potatoes.  It needed pepper and Tabasco, but I have found that most clam chowders are on the bland side, so this wasn't a surprise.  I'd order this again.  Likewise, my fish was cooked really well.  It was flaky and not overdone, and the parmesan crust was tasty, but I could have used more.  It was in a cream sauce that was BEGGING for seasoning.  This was superfluous, all it did was make the dish wet.  But, the spinach on the side was seasoned very well.  One of the better spinach dishes I can remember having.  If I were to order this again, I would ask for no sauce.  My buddy ordered the blackened scallops in a Cajun cream sauce over pasta.  When it arrived, I was jealous.  It looked FANTASTIC.  I immediately regretted my order.  But, when he tasted it, there was no flavor to the cream.  It was colored as though it had lots of pepper in it, but it was only cream.  It was actually impressive how something that looked so good could taste so bland.  So, he picked out the scallops and ate them.  The server noticed he didn't eat the pasta and asked him why.  When he told the server the issue, the server offered him another entree.  My buddy declined, so the server got him a gratis cocktail.  I think the dish should have been taken off the bill entirely, but at least he made some gesture.  I'd eat here again, but absolutely wouldn't order that \"Cajun\" pasta.",

We were told to seat our self, but all the tables that were cleaned was ride next to another party. We sat in the back by the bar. The lighting was really dim. It was actually kinda hard to read the menu. I already had an idea of what I wanted, the Sauteed Clams in White Sauce w/pasta. ($2 extra for the noodles) My friend wanted to get the clam chowder and my BF wanted the oysters. We all ended up sharing which was great, cuz we loved all of it. There was so many clams in my pasta, I seriously think there was more clams than noodles. How often does that happen? The clam chowder was just out of this world. It reminded me of the one I had back @ home in San Francisco. The oysters were kinda small, but still delicious. It did get busy when we left.  I felt like the service didn't match the level of the restaurant. It wasn't the greatest, and honestly, it brought the place down. I mean like I said before the dirty tables, then it felt like we were being rushed in ordering our food. The guy came around three times in less than 4 mins. Seriously? How about you go clean some tables rather than rushing your customers. Then when our food was brought out, they didn't even ask us whose was whose. They just sat it down in front of whomever. So major star taken off!!  Overall, this place, was okay, the FOOD, was good. I would go back, but it's not a place that I would NEED to go back to. If the service changes, then yes I would make sure to go back.",

    "text": "Fellow Yelpers, you have hit the nail on the head with this one.   I'm originally from the East Coast and I do have opinions about seafood. Stuck-up, know-it-all opinions... and I was blown away by this restaurant.   I went to this restaurant strictly based on the reviews I read here and I had an incredible experience! We ordered a garden salad, half-dozen oysters on the half-shell, crab cakes, and the bouillabaisse.   The salad was your standard restaurant starter. Fresh vegetables and nothing fancy. But that's not what I came for. The oysters - the OYSTERS!! YES!! - were so, so good. I was sorry we had only ordered a half dozen! They were cold, fresh, shucked in front of us, and eaten in about two minutes. The \"Maryland-Style\" crab cakes were very meaty, with very little, if no bread at all. The seasoning was very light and I was impressed, and I am very, VERY opinionated when anyone claims \"Maryland\" when describing their crab dishes. The bouillabaisse had LARGE shrimp and HUGE scallops as well as mussels, clams, lobster and fish. The broth was a little too rich for my taste but I can appreciate how enjoyable the dish is. I noticed that the people seated next to us had ordered the jambalaya and a fried shrimp appetizer. Both of those dishes had the very large shrimp. On the other side of us, I overheard a man telling his server that he comes to this restaurant every time he visits Las Vegas, and was bringing his companion for the first time, who remarked about how much they enjoyed the food.   Our server was excellent. He was very friendly, offered helpful suggestions and even hinted to us that while there was a charge for an official split-plate request, there was no charge for him to bring me an extra plate... (if I wanted to split the food myself).   A great meal and I will definetly be back!",

The oysters were really fresh, the shrimp were jumbo although I thought 6 shrimp would have been better than the 4 they gave, and the risotto offered some much needed warmth from the 50 degree weather outside.

Also understand that I've never given five stars unless the food is extraordinary or the service is benchmark. So, I just had dinner with a work associated and I'm impressed enough to give it five. Trent, along with a woman who's name escapes me were gracious, attentive, honest and very knowledgeable. They get the top rating however the food was also delicious. In all, an oyster shooter, Six oysters royale which were divine, six grilled oysters with parmesan, quite good, I had the Carolina crab boil and my friend had the seafood risotto. Both were ample portions, cooked correctly and Trent even had extra garlic tossed into the boil which is something I'd acquired a taste for in Louisiana. Go for the food at fair prices (for the quality) and stay for the friendly and conversational service. I'll be back and I don't tread over the same ground often, especially around here!",

It is more or less in the middle of the casino. They have a big circular bar and a few tables on one end and maybe some more tables inside the restaurant. We just ambled up to the bar and sat down. The bartender was really friendly and quick to get us situated with beers and oysters. We got a dozen on the half shell and a half dozen Rockefeller. The raw ones were being shucked right there by a equally friendly gal.  The bartender said the oysters were from New York. No choice of bivalves, but I really don't need choices if the ones they have are good and fresh, which these were. They were also not expensive, especially for the Las Vegas strip. The Rockefeller was really good. Very rich and saucy with the juicy oyster underneath the spinach and what not. Quite different from the ones I had at Binion's the night before. Overall a very good place to camp out with beer and oysters.",

Also crabby Mary - very good Bloody Mary!! Highly advised sit at bar - the only thing that's not great about the place is the ambience / but the staff totally makes up for it.",

Come to think of it the guy needed prompting the whole time! For food that ain't cheap this kind of service is cray... Especially with the wealth of good dining options in Vegas. Run away from this place. They suck! My bacon-wrapped scallops were gross- covered in BBQ and the white fatty part of bacon, not the standard solid minutely fatty looking pieces real restaurants serve.   I love seafood whether it be fine dining or dive style. This place sucked by all standards and the service was exceptionally poor.",

Super tasty and not fishy, caviar eggs pops in your mouth! Their jumbo shrimp cocktails are delicous, shrimps are big, sweet and cocktail sauce is on point! This place has a nice atmosphere, few tv's around to watch the games, good for a mid day snacker and drink.",

The pan roast was rich and absolutely delicious, and our server/cook, Dennis, was even kind enough to give us extra rice because we were sharing.   Service was exceptional, had our waters/bread bowl refilled constantly and all of our needs satisfied almost immediately (though this may have also been because we were at the bar).",

I do like this oyster bar at Harrah's, what didn't tickle my fancy is the lack of seating in the tiny location as it has to share seating and location with KGB so it's a mix match of seats and high tables, and a small steel divider separates you from the casino floor.  The oysters were on point, the regular pacific west oysters and Kamasuto oysters are delicous. I love me some raw shucked oysters, and any chance I can get to binge on it is A-OK with me!  Definitely get the baked oysters with parmesian cheese, if you're a fan of garlic and cheese, but other than that, the name of the game is raw oysters!",

Boy was I disappointed! The oysters came out room temperature. It was flavorless and had no scent of parmasean or garlic. :( For $24 a dozen, I expected them to be bigger.

So I call the front desk and the police to file a claim about how this restaurant handles their food!! My whole entire family members got food poisoning! Never Ever coming here again!! Its sad to show that the Las Vegas got terrible restaurants!! I'm sure how many other people that came to this restaurant suffer from food poisoning. But I'm just one average person that said something about their food handling!! Very disappointed to know the people that is working there the staff doesn't take any responsibility for this kind of situation so I have to take into my own actions and do something about it because this isn't fair to anyone!!!

If you eat here, please make sure to tip this guy good, he totally deserves it.  Last but not least, the restaurant itself is extremely cute and cozy, there is no other way to put it.

That line from Alice in Wonderland was stuck in my head as my friends and I sat down and enjoyed a whole lotta oysters here at Oyster Bar.   This was the setting for the beginning of my friend's bachelor party. We were all looking forward to this as we had some champagne in tow and a lot of smiles. Naturally we had to start off with two dozen oysters and I loved every single one I had. There was an excellent range and I loved that you could taste the difference in all of them.   Now, there was no way we were just going to eat oysters. Not with a lot of other delicious options on the menu. So, we had to dig into the crab cakes and get an order of mussels. The mussels were exactly how one would want them with a nice savory quality to the broth. The crab cakes were the real fun though. There was a lot of meat in them and we all had to put in for multiple orders.  Oyster Bar was exactly what I wanted and needed to start off my 40 hours in Vegas. We were all smiles and had a bunch of tasty mollusks to get us going. Welcome to Vegas!",

Especially loved the crunchy texture of the corn that the scallops were served on. I ordered a side of white rice which was a mistake. It came out cold. But it was late so i didn't care.

If that's what you want to call them. Perhaps I'm spoiled in having the real thing in NOLA but this wasn't even comparable. Pretty much whole spinach and cheese just baked into an oyster. No detection of Pernod or anything else although it clearly states it's supposed to have it on the menu. AND THE GRAND DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE EVENING. THE \"PAN ROAST\". Why is it in quotations you might ask?! Because that shizz isn't even remotely close to pan roast. And it's not even related to the pan roast at the Palace Station. They're not even third cousins twice removed.  This crap concoction was sweet( ew) brothy and oh the best part... The seafood was so overcooked it was inedible.  How in the hell do you mess up a whole lobster tail, crab legs and crab claws? What a complete waste. My bf's New England boil was the same. Disgusting.  We tried to get the servers attention but he ignored us for about 10 mins. When he finally came over and asked how everything was my bf started to let him know then his rude ass literally held up his hand to tell him to stop talking. Then took someone else's order and walked away. I was fuming!!! I had to go up to the hostess and ask for the manager. She wasn't very friendly either! Ugh what a waste of a meal. We both left feeling sick. :( AVOID",

From a stand point outside looking in. It dosnt look like anything great. But once you meet the staff and try the food your whole aspect on it will change fast.    They have premium oysters for a bit more than the normal dozen. Normally they have 4 different kinds from around the world. If you want, you can make a dozen any combination you like. Staff is helpful to identify and describe the oysters to help you get a better understanding of what your eating or about to eat. If you love fish tacos I highly recommend them as well. They are grilled, so you dont feel as bad about eating them. Plus they have a Amazing sauce that they put on top. If you love Crab legs they are amazing as well. They cut them in half and it seems they grill them but I am still unsure. Having the crab legs cut in half makes it easy to eat and allows them to add a seasoning to them.    I hope everyone that loves seafood gets at least one chance to eat here. Ive ate at many seafood places in town and have still yet to find one that beats the Oyster Bar.",

We were just hunting for a snack, so we only got a 1/2 dozen of grilled oysters. But the menu had me salivating and already planning a return visit. From clams and mussels to king crab legs and shrimp, all your seafood needs can be met here. They also have a ribeye, salads, etc. We opted to sit at the bar. It's an open prep bar with several stools, and then there's a few tables around it. It was fun to be able to watch everything being prepared, oysters being shucked, etc. And the service was very friendly and attentive. The grilled oysters were crazy delicious. And excellent mix of flavors. This will be my go-to oyster prep from now on. They also have a decent list of cocktails and wines. And the prices are quite reasonable. We will most definitely be back (and soon).",

I felt as though you cannot go wrong with any food items you choose.  Each dish comes with a special sauce (I am a sauce man) that just enhances every flavor you get.  The panroast was amazing.  The shrimp was huge (Good idea to dip it in the panroast sauce since the shrimp can be a little dry)!  The oysters were sized right (Careful on the wasabi-like dip).  What really did me in was the seafood risotto.  I do not usually prefer risotto, but they definitely did something with this dish that got me hooked.  The texture was perfect, the sauce was perfect, everything was just so delicious.  Each bite was something to savor, being drunk or not.",

Our favorite oyster place with buck a shuck at Caesars closed so we decided to try the oyster bar at Harrahs. We walked through the casino and easily found it. Immediately it felt like a dive bar.   We sat ourselves and were excited to see a few familiar oysters (blue point, Kumamoto, kushi). We wanted to do a pair of each but since their computer system can't handle that, our choice was limited to ordering 6 or 12 of each kind of oyster. This makes no sense for any food establishment ever conceived.   We ordered half dozen kushi and half dozen blue points. The woman shucking the oysters seemed completely disinterested in life all together. I understand that shucking oysters is not a glamorous job but she avoided all customers around her, engaged nobody and worst of all, left shell pieces in each and every single oyster she shucked. We were given the oysters, asked for mignonette (had to be made separately) which tasted like pure ACV. Thinking this was Vegas we took a risk on this place but lesson learned.",

Every main entree is about $35, but definitely worth it. WARNING: every entree is way too much for just one person.  The place is super easy to find, its located near the Flavors buffet in Harrahs (near the McDonalds/Chipotle entrance). I came here around 8pm on a Saturday with 4 others, we were seated very quickly. The restaurant can seat about 60 people, but they seemed a little short on staff that night. The menu is smaller than most restaurants which is nice because everything on the menu is hard enough to choose from. I was torn between the New England Steamer and the Seafood Risotto, the risotto won. Luckily, someone in my party got the steamer, and they were both amazing and huge! They were both filled with clams, mussels, baby scallops, giant shrimp and half a lobster tail. I've never been to a seafood restaurant that had such big portions. The only tiny thing I did not like was that some of the clams were a little sandy. The other people in my party ordered the Fish and Chips, Jambalaya with Chicken and Clam pasta. The Fish & Chips and Jambalaya didn't seem like anything special, but the clam pasta was nicely overloaded with clams.  So please give this place a try and try the risotto or steamer.  I for sure can't wait to go back!",

But this is Harrah's, part of Caesar's Entertainment, so I was willing to suspend my normal skepticism.  That was a mistake.  The oysters ($33 for a dozen) were bland.  No flavor.  They were reduced from a delicacy to a vehicle for cocktail sauce.  We also had the bisque - which was about as flavorful as any canned soup, though the did provide actual oyster crackers, for which they get a serious thumbs up.  The third item we ordered, a lobster roll, was tasty enough, though quie small.  Again, lobster in the desert, I understand it's not going to be like the ones I get in Maine or Massachusetts.  One other note - service was VERY slow.  Slow with the drinks.  Slow with the food.  And slow with the  bill.  $95 for oysters, lobster roll, soup and non-alcoholic drinks, is actually not that bad... especially for a hotel on the strip.  However, the food was not that special.  Stick to the steak houses and the beer pubs.  Less likely to be underwhelmed.",

We got there around 6pm ish and we were seated right away! The restaurant wasn't empty but it wasn't jammed packed. I tried their famous pan roast and it was very different from what I had from Kettlebar Steam Cooking in Anaheim in SoCal. The pan roast at Kettlebar Steam Cooking is very rich, creamy and heavy - very rustic and very satisfying. The pan roast here was a bit more watery and had a slight sweetness to it. Not that it wasn't good, but it wasn't as good as I expected. The seafood was abundant and fresh which I cannot complain.",

But that's what you get! We were in the mood for a quick bite before we headed over to the High Roller so we ponied up to the bar, ordered a couple shooters and a dozen a piece.   The shooters - oh my. Mine was a sort of tart ginger concoction that made me instantly want another one. And the oysters were super tasty and fresh, shucked right in front of you. The only disappointment was the service - not the greatest - and we got 2-3 oysters on each of our dozens that were clearly the runts of the litter. I get that if you're running this type of place, you probably try to portion out the runts a little to each customer so they don't complain, but I'd prefer you just tossing those into shooters and giving me the bigger on the half shells. Overall though a nice experience and worth a stop if you're in Harrah's.",

The rolls they brought to the table were actually stale, which was a disappointment. Our Bourbon Street Jambalaya was actually quite flavorful. I have to give props to our waiter for his patience because our party couldn't make up their mind at first and he stood there calmly as they finally made a decision.

Totally different recipe. At Palace Station the Pan Roast is creamier, Spicier, and thick. The Pan Roast here was so watery! It was weirdly sweet. The only thing that's worth it is the amount of seafood they gave you. The color was really light too. Taste like they put barbecue sauce in it. We also got the Oysters Rockefeller. That too was not good too. For all you readers if you want the real Pan Roast just go to Palace Station and just wait. It will be worth it. I felt so bad for writing this but it's the truth. They should fix the recipe for their Pan Roast here .",

    "text": "Went here for lunch on two consecutive days and sat at the bar.   The first day during the NFL playoffs on Sunday, I ordered the salmon. It was well above average in taste and cooked correctly. In my opinion it was about a 10 oz filet grilled and seasoned perfectly.  The second day arrived right at opening, 12 noon on Sunday. The restaurant immediately filled up to at least half capacity during my hour that I ate. I ordered 1 dozen grilled oysters and 1 lb of blackened shrimp at the recommendation of food server Raymundo.  He advised me that that was a lot of food, but for I believe $6 more than the 1/2 lb shrimp (the menu prices have changed), this was well worth it.  The shrimp were very large and I received about 24 pcs of shrimp if not more in the 1 lb. These shrimp are not tiger shrimp, so don't expect something exotic. The seasoning was perfect, and was tasted through the shrimp peelings. Be careful, this dish is served hot, so I would wait at least a couple of minutes before peeling your first shrimp. For those who like shrimp headless, these come headless, but not de-veined.  As for the grilled oysters, they were served just after the shrimp and I'd say it was well worth it. The caveat is that I've been to New Orleans, and these unfortunately don't come close to Acme Oyster House chargrilled oysters. These oysters were good and were medium to large in size. The oysters used for grilling are not the same ones usually served cold.  As for service, I'd say it was good considering there was only one food server allotted for the dining tables and one for the bar area.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a seafood fix that isn't sushi. All the food is fresh and cooked with flavor.",

However, that said, the Clam Chowder here was excellent. Their version of the Pan Roast was lacking in flavor but on the bright side the large chunks of fresh seafood made up for that in some ways. The sauce is a sweeter than what we would have liked and reminded me a bit of BBQ sauce but overall we had a great experience.",

The ambience though is a little stale with not much interaction with servers or anything to look at besides people playing the slots. Doesn't bother me much, but it does help a restaurant with high price points to provide some sort of background music to over power the slots and maybe a few flat screens around to keep your guests entertained, even the ones that come to dine in solo. Our server was very quick and certainly did his job just serving, but didnt try to sell or up sell us on anything or educate us on what type of oysters they had and what would be best. It is very pricey of course, for about $22 you will get half a dozen of half shelled oysters which are not huge in size. I also order a side of fries which sucked. It was seasoned, but the freshness of the fries was not there. I could immediately tell it had been sitting out in a bowl for a while until someone like myself ordered some. Because of that, the fries were stale and had no crunch. I also ordered one oyster shooter for about $8 which was good, but ive had better at a better price in San Diego. Overall, its a good starting point to try some oysters but it wouldn't be my go to based on prices and ambience.",

There was zero wait, but the place was understaffed so the service was a bit slow.   Food:  Clam Chowder- Creamy and delicious. They were very generous on the clam bits and potato. Highly recommend sharing between 2 people.   Oysters- They had different tiers of oysters going at different price. We got a dozen Blue Point oysters for $28 and a dozen of another kind that I forgot....(same tier as Kumamoto) for $35. The oysters were extremely fresh and fatty AND SWEET. I was in oyster heaven.   O.B. Pan Roast- They put a good variety of seafood in it, my favorite was the clams. The crab legs they had was a bit overcooked and so was the lobster. The broth was a bit watery to my liking, but overall the flavor was not bad.  Even though the service was slow but our waiter was super friendly and helpful! Will be back for the oysters!",

The grilled oysters, shrimp, and bouillabaisse were outstanding.  The others were average.  Overall food was good.  But service was a bit lacking.  We stood there for several minutes - no host/hostess to greet or seat us.  Eventually we asked a server and she said just to grab a seat.  We had no menus so had to go grab a couple ourselves.  Unfortunately, we had to catch a show and thought it would be a good place before it got busy.  The best service we received was a from a busgirl named Remy.  She was great and deserves a bonus!  She pretty much waited on our table - asked for refills, cleared out old plates, asked how we were, etc.  I recommend this place for the food but the service...I can't imagine what it's like when it's packed.",

I only came cause my sister got me some dining voucher comps.  WHAT WE ORDERED: 3 shooters (Bloody Mary, Asian Bomb, & Tequila Lime) $14 -- okay, these are definitely NOT my thing. My friend finished all 3. I only had sips. It's the alcohol, bleh.  Bourbon Street Jambalaya w/ Chicken $18 -- This wasn't too bad; it wasn't delicious or anything, but it was pretty decent.  Sauteed clams in white sauce -- Typical clams but it was pretty sandy. There were about 3 closed ones and I managed to open one and it was just very BLACK and sandy. Wasn't a pretty sight.  Oyster Grill (half-dozen) -- This was one of the better things I had tonight. Yum! I'd totally get it again.  Prices are definitely not in my budget but I'd really like to try the other things on their menu (i.e. the seafood platter for two) so if chance gives me it, maybe I'll be back one day...

I originally asked the manager who took our order, what he recommended between jambalaya and the seafood risotto and he said jambalaya with shrimp with sub certainty I went for it. And I'm so glad that I did.    We also got a dozen oysters before we realized there were premium oysters available as well. The regular dozen was amazing! We also got a half dozen Rockefeller, which was very yummy too if you like grilled oysters. It's definitely packed with flavor, it's in the heavier side for an oyster but the flavor is worth it. After we had all that we realized there were premium, I had read in a yelp review that the shigoku is the one to try, but my boyfriend loves kushi oysters. I asked the main person and he said shigoku and the other lady agreed as well. We got a half dozen because we were already so full, the person was super nice and gave us 2 free kushi to try, so we could compare.   Shigoku wins for sure!! One of the most delicious oysters I've had. To me, I like the regular oysters better than the premium kushi, but everyone has their own opinion.   The service was amazing and the price was reasonable. You save $1 off all items if you're a total rewards member, any tier. So that's cool!   Great experience, I would definitely go there again when I'm in Vegas.",

In fact everything that kept coming out of the kitchen for other guests looked so good we ended up placing more orders.  To top it off we went out of our way to go back the night before we had been scheduled to fly home and the staff and chefs remembered us and pampered us even more.  This is the type of food and service that I would make it a point to return the next time in Las Vegas!!",

    "text": "This place was aight. Not that fancy and I somehow confused it with another oyster bar at The Palace Station, so I was deeply disappointed when I found out they were two different places. Considering I was staying at the Harrah's and I needed a quick bite before heading out for the night, this was a close option without going too ham.   I order a half dozen oyster with wasabi caviar and a clam chowder. I guess I wasn't that hungry so this was enough to fill me up. Thankfully, they do offer a basket of bread and sesame chip/cracker thing...a lot of it.   The oysters were whatevs. The oyster themselves were fresh and a little bit briny since they were medium sized, but I thought the creme fraiche and a huge dollop of wasabi caviar was a bit excessive. I had to scoop most of it off and just douse it with a lot of lemon juice. The creme fraiche was so thick and creamy and the wasabi caviar, tasteless. It didn't have that kick of spicy I was expecting. It would have been better if it was just wasabi creme served on the side.   Clam chowder was your typical run of the mill bowl of clam chowder. Nothing to write home about.   Also, if you have a Total Rewards card, there will be some discounts for you! A couple dollars off for most of the menu so I can't say everything was bad. :P",

    "text": "We came in a Sunday afternoon for lunch and it surprisingly wasn't busy compared to the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station. We walked up to an empty kiosk and a sign that said to wait to be seated. We waited a good 10 minutes before a guest behind us told us that maybe we should just seat ourselves. As we were about to sit down, the hostess comes up with this really annoying tone telling us, \"my sign says to wait to be seated.\"  We informed her that we were waiting for a good while and her excuse was that she was in the back and didn't see us.   Anyway, we requested a table for 3 and we immediately seated. This ends up being our biggest mistake. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to run by and tell is that he'll be right with us. We waited another 5 minutes before he finally tends to us. He ended up being very friendly, but he was just too slow. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, a dozen oysters, seafood risotto, and Cajun scallops along with a couple of drinks. The drinks and soup came out pretty quick, but after that it was another 15-20 minute wait for the rest of our entrees and oysters. I got annoyed watching diners sitting at the bar, who arrived way after us, receive their plates of oysters and entrees.   The food was actually very good so no complaints there. The food is actually earning my two stars. After eating we end up waiting another 15 minutes for the waiter to pass by our table again to ask for our check. Surprisingly, he was very quick with swiping my card. However, not once were we checked up on. I'm not the type that needs to be treated like a king , but I do believe that waiters should work for their tip. Sadly, we would not return.",

Be careful don't get full off that though.   Servers are extremely nice and so are the cooks.   We had chatted with one of the cooks our first time there and asked when they receive their shipment of oysters and other seafood. He said they come in fresh every morning.

The were served spit so I didn't have to fight to get the meat out.  The asparagus was good.  I also ordered a mixed drink, and the pour was so generous that I asked for a little more soda because I'm kind of a wimp.  Our friend had the fish special of the day, and said it was very good.  I would definitely go back for the crab legs!  There were also TVs so that we could keep an eye on the Thursday Night Football game.",

She was really pleasant and checked on us regularly. She suggested the oyster shooters in the glass, and omg!!  Yummy Buzz!! We got 2 plain with just tequila and the other one with the pineapple juice and jalapeno mixture.  I would go back here for the crab cakes any day.  I forgot our servers name, but she was a really cool hispanic girl, with a memorable laugh. :D in a good way. This is my new \"we HAVE to go there\" place when I'm in Las Vegas.",

Our first trip in was a slow spot in the day and the bar is off to the side of the casino in a corner. Worried me a little, but the calamari was a huge portion size and amazing.  The bar picks up at night and the atmosphere was much better. This time we tried the crab cakes and clam chowder. Both fantastic and tasted very fresh. My mom has an unusual fascination with clam chowder and she had to get another bowl the next day.  The last time we got a recommendation from a couple to get the grilled oysters. WIN. Get the grilled oysters.  I don't mind Vegas prices....these are getting towards the high side but we are coming back to Harrah's oyster bar next trip, no doubt about it.",

I accidentally navigated myself here, but it was the best mistake I could've made. I ordered the pan roast because that was what my friend suggested to me, thinking it was at the other restaurant, so I did. They served it to me in a giant metal bowl that looked like half a mini torpedo. It was kinda cool. The pan roast comes with a variety of fresh, well cooked seafood that was absolutely delicious. It was served in this yellowish curry that stole the show. I could not stop eating and tasting it. I was tempted to take a dish  home with me, but at $31 I decided to save it for some gambling. Service was good. Although I did have to wait a whole after my meal for the waiter to come by and ask if I needed anything else, which I did. Overall good experience though. I would consider staying at Harrah's just so I can eat here. Plus it's open 24/7. Awesome!",

    "text": "The five stars is for the quality of the raw oysters. This is what any oyster bar should be judged on. They were perfect raw oysters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Shigoku were to die for, and the Kusshi were wonderful.  (I would have liked some raspberry/shallot mignonette to accompany them as well as the standard chili/horseradish sauce)  The rest I would rate at four stars.  Ly and Trent, our 'chef - servers' were great.  One hint: If you get the  Oysters Rockefeller (which were quite good though not spectacular, - at least there was no bacon, thank God !!!!)  ask them to put a little extra Pernod on them and to finish them in the \"salamander\" (They'll understand). Also ask them to use the speciality oysters for the Rockefeller instead of the Fanny Bay which are larger. In general with oysters, smaller is better.  The clam chowder was very good, but on the very salty side, three stars, but enjoyable.  I thought the grilled oysters were a waste, they just tasted like parmesan cheese with hot garlic butter.  Try the Sea Glass Sav Blanc for wine. Yes, it's the cheapest on the menu, but that's not the reason. It's just plain good with the oysters. We had 2+ bottles and could easily have had another if we had any more room for more oysters.  The Key Lime Pie is acceptable, not nearly as good as I make, but better than most restaurants' versions. I enjoyed theirs.  We didn't try any other food but I saw it being prepared and it looked good and creative. For example the bouillbaisse had not only saffron, as required by all recipes, but Pernod, as well. Very interesting!!  <a href=\"mailto:jpl779@sbcglobal.net\">jpl779@sbcglobal.net</a>",

We sat at the bar and watched them shuck the oysters and prepare our meals!  My husband and I both had \"kettle\" cooked items - he had the seafood bouillabaisse and I had the seafood risotto.  Both were excellent choices.  The bouillabaisse was like a seafood \"treasure hunt\" - it had a nice sized lobster tail, huge shrimp, mussels and fresh fish in a wonderful stock - it seemed as if you could put your spoon in the bowl and bring up something new each time!!  The risotto was cooked to perfection as we watched and tasted amazing.  Again, an assortment of fresh seafood throughout the entire bowl.  Our server, Trent, was also the cook and he was highly entertaining and extremely attentive.  Very fresh oysters and assorted seafood served in a surprising, casual atmosphere made this one of our new LV favorites!!",

    "text": "Been eating here for years.  Fell in love with the clam chowder and the wait staff and chefs.  We became regulars on our semi-annual Vegas trips and got to know everyone by name.  Sadly most of them have been let go but that hasn't affected the food one bit.  They change their menu every couple of months but you have to get the clam chowder.  The king crab legs are also very good.",

The food was amazing! My sister and husband had oysters they said it was really good. I had the risotto rice rice seafood dish. It's similar to the Spanish Paella dish. It has a curry cream rich elegant tang to it. The clams, mussels, lobsters, and king prawn where a great size and I still had some left over. It's a great sit down joint to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Harrah's without being secluded from the action. Also our waiter/chef reminded me of Carlos Mencia with his Spanish accent; great personality and charming charisma! He brought the food and environment alive! My sister had the blackened fish; the flavors mingled and tinged together. It was unique flavorful that was worth eating slow!",

The oysters were very fresh and the bouillabaisse (seafood soup) was very chunky and flavorful.  And on top of it all, it was very reasonably priced.  For all you vegas visitors, come check this place out!",
