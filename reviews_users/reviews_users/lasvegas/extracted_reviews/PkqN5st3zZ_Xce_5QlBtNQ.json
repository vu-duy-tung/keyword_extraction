I actually tried it on 2 separate occasions and both times it was gross. I'll just stick to the pancakes and tots.",

They always say that Las Vegas is the 9th Hawaiian Island... i'm a life-long Hawaii girl living on the mainland now and I certainly miss my local Hawaii food.  Cinnamon's is a classic.  It's a must do for any visitor to Hawaii - and the original Cinnamon's is NOT in Waikiki.  It's no tourist trap.  It's in Kailua, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu.  Tourists and locals alike make the trek out to Kailua, stand in long lines, and wait to eat at Cinnamon's.  Luckily, the Las Vegas location didn't require much of a wait.  But I'm certain once people learn about this place, it will start filling up.  You can get your local staples here like Loco Moco, Portuguese sausage, kim chee fried rice, and of course, the Cinnamon's classics like Macadamia Nut Pancakes!!  So... the coffee cups are pretty tiny, but they come around and fill them up constantly so no problem!  And you cannot beat the service - it's local style... what do you expect!!  I had kalbi and Portuguese sausage.  Yeah, I'm a pig and not embarrassed by it one bit.  Thank you very much.  I will most certainly make my way back here on the regular whenever I am in Las Vegas!!",

    "text": "BS +++  So all these  reviews about it's not as good or service is bad.  NOT ALL EXPERIENCES are the same.  So let's break my experience down.  From the outside it looks like an old location but then  boom! Some pretty lady greets you as soon as you walk in.  She has a flower on one ear and she's super smiley (Like every Hawaiian mom greets her kids).  The place is fancy.   The  front  area looks like it used to be an old deli.  But it's kinda chill and the  design  is so calming.  Out waitress Alyssa is super chill and so nice.  She's attentive and always  checks on us.  Maybe because I looked really hangry from my workout.  She offers us this special with THREE MINI pancake flavors.   Their version of MINI is HUGE!!!! I also ordered the breakfast crabcakes since my father-in-law can't eat too much sodium.  Along with brown  rice.  The pancakes comes out and their AMAZING! They are soft and fluffy but are so sweet except the pistachio which was so so good.  The colors, the flavors was like eating food off a rainbow.  I was seeing yellow moons and pink horseshoes and red balloons!  Anyway, the crabcake was fluffy and filled with spinach.  I was super happy with my choices and didn't even finish the pancakes.  The service here is the bomb.  Even the restrooms are super nice and really is homey here.  I would give it a try  just for the hell of it.  It's far.  But Vegas has  nice highways.  I drove  all the way around from S Rainbow just to come here.  Best part they are close to a TRADER JOES!  I will definitely be back!  Waitress was ATTENTIVE and ALL SMILES Food is BOMB Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING Restrooms are CLEAN and NICE WALL PAINTINGS Tables FANCY and RUSTIC Table wait time PLACE WAS EMPTY Take out wait time is QUICK Customer service is GREAT Ambiance HOMEY AND MODERN Kitchen SUPER CLEAN  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

    "text": "I've been training for a half-marathon and this restaurant is conveniently right across the street from my running trail. My friend and I would walk here after our run as part of our cool down and get sustenance...killing two birds with one stone.  Pistachio Cream Pancakes: This is like having dessert for breakfast/ brunch. I must say I don't get excited with pancakes and I prefer its cousin, waffles (pancakes with abs). But the pistachio cream was a nice touch to a rather boring breakfast item. 5/5  Crab Cakes: At first, I thought these were the pistachio Pancakes because crab cakes aren't usually green. They're green because they combine crab and spinach for these cakes. Very tasty and they're not like your basic crabby patties. 5/5  Guava Chiffon Pancakes: Two of the things that I don't find amusing: guava and Pancakes. Put them in one plate and in my head it's not supposed to taste good but nope! These were awesome! The Pancakes were light and fluffy and the guava syrup was fruity but wasn't too sweet. 5/5  Prime Rib Loco Moco: Oh, yes, yes, yes! Normally, you get beef patties with eggs, rice and gravy. I got mine with overhard eggs, brown rice and added mushrooms and onions. The prime Rib was tender and delightful. This dish was flavorful without being too salty. It was just right.  House Blend Coffee: I'm not a Hawaiian coffee connoisseur and I'm not even going to pretend that I am. I'm a fan of Vietnamese coffee and everything else is brown water to me. So, it would be unfair for me to rate this coffee. You get 1 free refill.  What I was most impressed with was the service. They're very attentive and friendly. And everyone seemed to care about their product and their customers. Marty is the manager/ owner and he checked on us multiple times and told us more about Cinnamon's and he was passionate about the food and customer service - and it shows.  Training season is for another 6 months and I'm glad this is a good post-run option for us. We'll be back for sure.",

I must have taken a test bite of all the pancake flavors here. The Guava Chiffon pancake is the bomb. The Pistachio Creme is okay. The Red Velvet is really good with a vanilla-white chocolate sauce...yumm! Talk about broke da mout!!!  If you order plain buttermilk, don't forget to ask for the coconut syrup. :)  Their tater tots are yummy. They make it extra crispy, topped with onion and peppers. Good portion....lots! I had the traditional Canadian bacon egg Benedict and it was so-so, but I was told that the crab cake was ono! Next time I try.   Coffee: Cinnamon's have their own House Blend Private Label Coffee. It's 25% Kona and 25% Kaua'i. It's $3.25, but well worth it! I can totally just live on this coffee, they sell it by the bag for take home too!   **Every Saturday 11-1pm, there is live music by  A lelenui, featuring my Kumu, Kahiki.   I gave it 4 stars because the 3 times I've been here, even though the service is Great, the service is slooow. I'm talking Hawaii-time slow. But if you neva mind, then you're okay.",

    "text": "Hot and New!!  We are so lucky in Las Vegas.  A lot of popular restaurants from Hawaii, California, and even New York have opened.  Not everyone likes it, but I do. The more, the merrier.    Cinnamon's is \"Hot & New\".  New to the 702, not to the 808.  Cinnamon's is clean, spacious, and the service is great.  They're known for their Guava Chiffon Pancakes and Signature Benedicts.  I don't prefer my eggs Benny style and can't eat fruit.  I also heard from other Yelpers that their stacks are a little dry.  So, as far as their signature plates go, I didn't even give them an attempt.  I did have their Kalbi and Prime Rib meals.  Both come with two eggs and a side.  The Kalbi is delicious and marinated perfectly.  Cinnamon's Prime Rib meal is a steal at only $16.95.  You get 10 oz. of prime rib, two eggs, and a side.  Now that's value that taste pretty good too. The rest of the menu consist of their Signature Benedicts, 5 types of pancakes, omelets, and 3 types of Loco Moco's.  Overall, I'm a fan and since I have an office close by, I will be back soon.  Loco Moco, you are next.    Just a note... My only gripe is the upcharge for an extra egg or egg whites.  An extra egg is $1.75 and egg whites is $2.25.  It never made sense to me why egg whites would cost more than whole eggs.  Pay more, get less??? This can get very expensive if you eat as many eggs as I do.",

Honestly the Crabcake was super flat, the Kalua pork tastes better without hollandaise, and the English muffin beneath them was too oily for my stomach.  Literally had growling reactions.  I'm not fluent in stomach growl and I can't speak it, but I understand its emotions.  Then I learn this place is actually known for their PANCAKES.  Alright so I'm not kicking it to the curb just yet like a horrible first date.  We'll be friends... I'll come back for your pancakes, Cinnamon.  I'm not a hater.",

I love guava, but did not care much for this guava flavoring/syrup.  Might be a good idea to share a short stack for everyone at the table, just to try. Definitely, not something I would choose solely as my breakfast or brunch meal. The kalbi was one of the best I've had in a long time.  Flavors and textures on point, with no big bones or unwanted chewy parts.  The restaurant is pretty spacious.  Order first, take a number, and find a seat.  I hope the paper plates and plastic forks are a temporary thing though.  I do want to come back for their benedicts and to try other pancake flavors! Service was super friendly and very attentive.  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 75/100",

The tater tots were full of subtle, not too salty flavors from the diced peppers and onions they are served with, the Korean omelette was savory and a little sweet with some tanginess to boot, and the guava pancakes brought us all the way back to our vacation in Kailua.  They are every bit as good as we remembered. We bought some of their Hawaiian coffee to go, and will be back soon.",

My experience was great, gave me the hawaiian feeling and the staff are attentive and stands behind their product. The first time i had a steak with wasabi and it is actually a great combination. The food overall is not out of ordinary as i expected to be because of the high ratings according the waiter and the information shared on the window. Food is serve on paper looking like bamboo. Real plates will better suit the ratings and menu price. The pancake was not too bad, giving a different experience with coconut syrup. Overall, it was too ordinary for me to come back or to compete with vegas quality and price.",

Our server was friendly and informative. He recommended some dishes for us to try and constantly checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our breakfast. I tried their famous Benedict's and man that hollandaise sauce is the reason I intend on returning. My boyfriend tried the Hawaiian omelette which he basically licked the plate clean. And speaking of plates, they were wooden which was different and super cool. We also ordered their guava pancakes which are supposed to be one of their signature dishes. Unfortunately, I don't believe in the hype. The sauce was cold which made the pancakes cold  and the flavors didn't stand out to me. We do intend on returning however because it was still an enjoyable breakfast.",

The restaurant was busy but not super-packed but it took almost 30 minutes to get our food.  And that was on top of a 20 minute wait for a table and 10 minutes before we could place our order with our waiter.  I like to compare this restaurant to Babycakes Cafe (Hawaiian-style like Cinnamon's) on Smoke Ranch and Buffalo, who have their stuff down pat and are ALWAYS busy.    I'm rooting for you, Cinnamon's - if you can get to the same level of efficiency and service as Babycake's, you'll have something good going here.  One major complaint, though ---- how do you not have corned beef hash as part of your everyday menu???",

While making the must stop at Trader Joe's, we discovered this Cinnamon's next door to it. We know how good the food is from eating at their Kailua location so we went to eat breakfast there immediately after shopping at TJs. This was the unexpected highlight of the trip because we received some of the best customer service we've ever had at a restaurant. Pono who was our server, was really great. He was sharp and we really enjoyed talking to him. To top it off, Marty, the manager came over to thank us for coming in and we had some great conversation with him too. Thank you to Pono and Marty for the awesome food and talks story sessions. I'm not sure when we'll be back but when we do, this is a must stop place at the top of our list!",

    "text": "Never been to the Cinnamon's in Hawaii, which is funny considering I grew up there. Well on to other matters, the interior decor is almost like a homebody country feel. I'm kind of not a big fan of ordering at the counter and waiting for your food to be delivered to you. I'm more of wanting to sit and look at the menu, then order kind of deal.  So before I even wrote that, the greeter came up to us as we stood in line and explained that there are actually two parts to the restaurant. One side had an express order, where you go up to the counter and order while you wait for your food in the first section & the other corner you have a full service area where a waiter comes and take your order. Kind of confusing, but I guess whatever works, works.   So after looking at the menu, I have decided on the crab cake egg Benedict with country tots. The full order, which I may add was a little filling. The bf got the omelet special which included lump crab and imitation crab w/ veggies, & for an upgrade got a side of kimchi fried rice. The flavors for both dishes were amazing, both equally delicious and not stingy when it comes to giving crabs.   After a week, we returned and this time I ordered the kalbi with eggs and kimchi fried rice and the bf got just the regular crab cakes with egg and kimchi fried rice. The flavors for the Kalbi was delicious! And so were the crab cakes, didn't think the kimchi fried rice was all that great that day, seemed like it was missing the kimchi. It became more of spam and soy fried rice to me.   Not bad of a brunch place, but somehow they seem to be lacking in service. Seems like the people aren't all that happy to be working there, on both occasions I've visited the workers seemed either annoyed or just unpleasant to be working there. Well other than that, the food is great so I guess that makes up for it.",

Our waitress was very accommodating and prompt when she was able. That is the extent of my good review.  We ordered some sort of dough balls as soon as we arrived to share at the table before we actually ordered breakfast. These arrived maybe 20-25 minutes later and were, at best mediocre. Sometime after we ordered the dough balls we ordered out breakfast. Two people ordered some sort of Benedict item one ordered pancakes and one ordered a mushroom spinach pocket. Our orders arrived oddly staggered. The spinach pocket and pancakes arrived about 5 minutes before one of the Benedict's. The Benedict was cold and the patron asked to have it microwaved. Waitress promptly did this. Then about 5 minutes later the other Benedict arrived, again cold except this patron didn't want to send it back. Overall from order to eating was a very long time and other than the pancakes nothing was worth having waited for.  On top of all of that, a cup of coffee cost over $3.00 and was just ordinary diner coffee.  The visit was lovely, as was the waitress but I will not be returning to this place",

Did I mention the pancakes?  So good!",

The food can only be topped by the amazing service. Our server was fabulous. She even brought us a special pancake from the menu for us to try, on the house. We ordered the red velvet pancake for our daughter who thought she was eating dessert for breakfast. Be sure to ask for a kids pancake if you only want one instead of a short stack. It's not on the menu. It was so good. My hubs got the French toast with the guava sauce over top and he was in Heaven. We both enjoyed the coconut banana pancake that they let us taste! If you're in Vegas and you haven't tried Cinnamon's you're missing out!",

My step dad got the red velvet pancakes with the ice cream and stole half my tots. My mom the kalbi beef plate. It's basically the loco moco deconstructed.

    "text": "What a happy place! Service is fast and courteous. Music is nice and fits the island theme.   First time here, so I tried their specialties: chiffon-papaya pancakes and eggs Benedict.   Coffee is good, solid coffee. Menu claims 50% Hawaiian blend, but doesnt describe the other half. 50% mystery coffee. Folgiers? Maxwell house? Starbucks?   Pancakes are exceptional. Fluffy and lightly sweet even without the syrups or sauces. Unfortunately, the chiffon-papaya sauce was so sweet I could feel a cavity forming from just one bite. I recommend ordering the sauce on the side and separate the papaya from the chiffon. The papaya sauce was fruity and delicious. I wish it had just that sauce.   Benedict: \"Award winning hollandaise sauce\"? Who hold this contest? I've heard of beer tastings, but I can't wrap my head around a room full of people drinking cup after cup of hollandaise sauce. Maybe a new bar theme? But I digress...  The lox Benedict was very good. The sauce was thick and tasted good to me.  But I'm untrained and can't be trusted to judge. I'd get it again.   Overall, a nice Hawaiian breakfast joint. Servings are huge, and the calorie count is off-the-charts. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Told early on by trusted palates that Cinnamon's was merely average it was some eighteen months after opening that a visit was finally scheduled, the presence of fellow Flapjack lovers in the house an impetus to finally check out the Hawaiian import that some publication apparently decided serves the eight best specialty Pancake in the United States.  Located at 7591 West Washington Avenue in the space previously occupied by Chef Marc's Parma, the layout similar but more open and less personal in its decor, guests entering Cinnamon's will quickly find themselves face-to-face with a hostess podium, this early Saturday fairly quiet with most guests lined along the north wall.  Playing light pop music overhead that is neither distracting nor necessary, the deli cases where Sgrizzi used to keep Salami and Salads now containing branded apparel and Lemon Cookies with proceeds benefitting The Animal Society, it was after sitting at a sizable banquet that a pleasant server named Alyssa stopped by to take orders, the $3.25 bottomless Coffee so smooth that no Cream or Sweetener is necessary kept full without a need for reminder throughout the morning.  Offering several island favorites plus items specific to Nevada, Pistachio Pancakes but one example, it was instead from daily specials and Cinnamon's favorites that five items were ordered, the $3 Cookie for a cause big, flexible and warm with plenty of Butter plus a delicate Citrus finish.  Able to order most items in half-portion, the prices adding up to a bit more than full-size plates but allowing greater variety, it was less than ten minutes after requests were made that four large plates arrived along with dishes for sharing, the house-roasted Pig offering a succulent first bite beneath a nicely poached Egg and tangy Hollandaise though the Tots tossed with Onions and Peppers were a little overcooked.  Moving on to sweeter things, Pure Maple Syrup brought from home used to slick Hawaiian Bread French Toast that would have achieved better texture with more time in Custard, it was from here that 2 x 2 short stacks were tasted, the daily special Carrot not really all that special save for rare bites featuring Fruit while the famous Guava Chiffon were medium-fluffy and light in Buttermilk which allowed one to focus more attention on the sweet and sour Sauce that tastes a lot like the liquefied interior of a Guava-Cheese Pastry.  THREE STARS:  In a city with plenty of great Breakfast and Brunch joints Cinnamon's is yet another face in the crowd save for fame gathered in Hawaii, the Guava Sauce worth a visit but not enough to prompt repeat patronage though the service team is certainly above average when compared to places like Babystacks, Egg & I or The Cracked Egg.",

I had the crab bennie, but they served me wrong and I got the Kahlua pork Bennie; so I was able to judge both. The hollandaise is decent but I have had much better. The eggs were cooked perfectly, but there wasn't any noticeable smokiness to the pork. The crab cake was decent but nothing to cry home about. The potatoes weren't seasoned at all.   My wife got the loco moco, and it wasn't seasoned either; just a burger covered in bland gravy. L&L has made better locos tbh. The customers next to us seems to agree about the flavor because we saw them furiously adding salt and pepper.   The server Natalia was very apologetic about the food. She was definitely awesome though.   All in all, it's not worth the price you pay unless you only want pancakes.",

Heard this place is famous for their guava chiffon pancakes. Ordered that and the Kalua Pig Benedict. Both were just meh. The pancakes were just your average buttermilk pancakes, smothered in pink guava sauce that had a bit of a sweet, tangy taste. Both the pancakes and benedict were a bit dry and I was expecting more flavor. I need to try the original Cinnamon's in Hawaii for comparison.",

The 9th Island.  It was mid morning. We just landed at McCarran from LA... I wanted rice. I wanted spam... So I had to get the spam and eggs. One of my favorite island style breakfasts. I t came with a scoop of rice, 3 thick slices of spam and per my request, scrambled eggs. It was perfect. We also shared the famous guava chiffon pancakes (short stack $6.75). It was great. Nice fluffy pancake with a delicious guava pancake sauce. Glad I finally got to try it. I really liked it... Also ordered was the kalua pork eggs benedict. It looked great and came with a side salad.   Service was attentive and friendly. We had a great brunch at Cinnamon's. I definitely recommend it. It may be a little bit of a drive from the strip but it's totally worth it. Parking is in a shared lot.",

Got to try the crab cake Benedict with tater tots & my boyfriend's kalbi rib breakfast. Everything was great besides taste because of the all the textures were on point.

    "text": "Great food and awesome friendly service. Perfect Authentic Hawaiian breakfast in town. We finally got to go here on a weekday and tried their pancake sampler which has red velvet, pistachio and their famous guava .  I am very particular with good customer service and they don't disappoint. They are friendly, courteous and engage their patrons.   KONA Coffee  is the \"bomb\" ... reminds me of this local coffee (barako) back in the Philippines. It's the only coffee I don't put any creamer whatsoever; it is perfect just the way it is (luv it).   Their Loco Mocos Menu in my opinion is the best deal with its generous portion sizes, you can't really go wrong with any of them, but Carsie's Boneless Kal-bi is my favorite go to dish. It is tender and perfectly seasoned.  I highly recommend this establishment and it really is a gem addition to the Valley ... supposed to be my secret favorite restaurant I'd like to keep for myself, but the cat is out of the bag now, so come support so we can keep them forever here in Vegas .",

I had the Hawaiian sweet bread french toast and a cup of coffee. The French toast was very fresh and obviously was cooked to order based on how long it took to receive it. Unfortunately, although the texture was nice it was flavorless. Their coffee is bad. Dark and murky and really should not be anywhere near $3.25. what makes it worse is that they use non-dairy creamer instead of real half and half. I am not 100% sure but I think that the French toast was served with a little ball of margarine, not butter.  I noticed that the people sitting next to me ordered the guava pancakes and the red velvet pancakes and they look amazing. I would go back and try again because the service was good and it is a nice, clean place. I just do not recommend the French toast or the coffee.",

We went here for the first time with family because I really really wanted to try their guava chiffon pancakes and I needed a break from cooking lol. I was really excited because I saw that they had a Cinnamon's here and it's originally from Hawaii. From the moment we walked in, we were greeting and seated. Our server was so nice and the manager was too! I love the welcoming feeling that this place gives you. That's already 5 stars there. We were enjoying ourselves, talking, laughing and having the hardest time to choose what to eat because EVERYTHING SOUNDS AMAZING! We over ordered because we wanted to try it all and by over ordered meaning, it all didn't fit on our tables lol! I had the crab cakes with Kimchi fried rice and omggggggg! Yum! Flavor flavor flavor!!!! My hubby and best friend ordered the Calbi ribs and they said it was sooo flavorful and it went well with the rice. My cousin ordered the loco moco and I was super surprised she finished her food! My godparents got the marinated Ribs too and it was all gone. But wait! We had guava and pistachio pancakes too!!! Allllllll amazing! Omg we finished about half the servings and they were so fluffy and I literally could cry haha! We took the left overs home and ate it for dinner. Still AMAZING! I can't wait for everyone to try their pancakes and food. Cheers!",

    "text": "The Guava Chiffon Pancakes were calling my name so off to Cinnamon's we went. Their system of ordering & paying first is unusual for a sit down restaurant. We ordered a short stack of Guava Chiffon Pancakes, Kalbi plate with fried rice & scrambled eggs & a Kalbi Loco Moco with fried rice. The Hawaiian radio station playing Island Music really helped to give you that island feel. The restaurant is open & comfortable but rather plain, expected more island decor.                                    Anyways onto the food- Unfortunately, my eggs were the only thing hot on my plate. The Fried rice & Kalbi were cold so I sent my plate off to be warmed up. When my plate came back, everything was hot but the Kalbi was in weird big chunks not thin or flat like Kalbi should be. Some of the meat chunks were all fat, it was inedible. I showed the Manager & he agreed that the Kalbi didn't  look like they should so he had the cook prepare 2 other pieces of Kalbi. By the time the new correctly looking pieces of Kalbi were brought to my table, what was left of my fried rice & eggs were cold. Not happy about that!                      The Kalbi Loco Moco was cold as well but he was too hungry to care. He said my Kalbi was flavorful but his wasn't. Needless to say the hubs has no interest of ever returning. I, on the other hand understand that they just opened & are still figuring out stuff. My Kalbi had good flavor although the fried rice scoop was rather small & needed some salt.                                      I thought the Guava Chiffon Pancakes were good, maybe a stronger Guava flavor would enhance the dish but all in all it was yummy. The Manager was very apologetic & tried to be accommodating. I wouldn't mind giving Cinnamon's another try but I'll give it a few months & hopefully all their wrinkles will be ironed out.",

My husband and his family had frequently dined at the Kailua location since it's opening in 1985, so it's really nice to have a place that we can continue to visit in our new city.  SERVICE - They've been open for 3 days. The staff is still learning the recipes, learning the POS, but are tremendously friendly and accommodating. The excitement of the staff and passion of its managers for ensuring consistency and quality is strongly felt and for me, appreciated. The managers and staff visited our table to make sure everything tastes as it should and if we needed anything.  I appreciated the manager who came over to ask our opinion and specifically asked \"Does everything taste like you remembered it from Hawaii\" Our answer: HELL YES.  FOOD - Um.... DELICIOUS. Tastes JUST like home. They need to get used to consistency of the portion sizes; as our friends food was coming out, they were a little larger than ours, but the flavor was definitely there. I understand they have to get used to portions; their cooks aren't from Hawaii and may not know the portion sizes of the Hawaii locations. But I mean c'mon: RED VELVET PANCAKES. THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD TASTE LIKE! Other pancake places here in Vegas make it but it's either too sweet or covered in chocolate sauce. This is what I've been wanting!!! Thank you! Lol  AMBIANCE - Very spacious, open and very pretty. I look forward to them having baked goods and merchandise. With the flavors of the food and the music, it was almost like being in their Kailua location.  Overall: I'm SO HAPPY they're here and I can't wait for them to grow. I'm looking forward to coming here VERY often.   Wishing them nothing but continued growth and prosperity. Welcome to Vegas!",

    "text": "Very disappointing -- hoping for them, they can get everything together and pick it up. Prices were extremely high, I thought. You walk in and order from the counter, they give you a number and you sit down. For not being a full table service restaurant and serving with plastic utensils, this makes the prices seem even more high.  Register person forgot to ring in my friend's pancakes though we didn't know. I received my sweet bread french toast ($8.75!) - came with about 6 half slices - not very many and it's only bread... how can it be $8.75 in Vegas (it doesn't even come with a side of meat). The coffee is also $3.50 and they give you a chip for 1 refill. What??? Since when does brewed coffee for $3.50 include only 1 refill?  My friend ordered the pancakes as mentioned but also ordered a benedict, what they are supposed to specialize in. After probably 15 minutes of waiting and me getting my french toast, the cook comes out to say they ran out of benedict sauce and can he wait. He said ok as the cook said maybe another 10 minutes. He asked for the pancakes while he waited to which the cook said ok. 15-20 minutes later and my french toast is now gone and still no benedict nor pancakes. I looked at the receipt and the pancakes weren't even on the receipt - she forgot to ring it in and not only that, the chef didn't say anything like \"I don't see pancakes on your receipt\" when he asked if he could have them while he waited (regardless, they couldn't bring out one or two pancakes while we waited??).  Finally stopped a worker who said they weren't happy with the benedict sauce and so were making it AGAIN so it would be another ??? minutes - they couldn't answer how long. So my friend ended up just eating guava pancakes that they ended up bringing, which he said (and looked) were dry.  Definitely wasn't up to the Hawaii Cinnamon's standards.",

The Hollandaise sauce is really good the Kalua pig was not too salty and the tater tats were surprisingly good....I didn't like how my Uncle's order of tats came out on a paper plates.

The staff was very welcoming and greeted everyone \"good morning\". My friend and I got arrived around 9am and it was still pretty empty. But by the time we were done with our meal, the place was packed (1030ish).   As for the food, the serving sizes are pretty big so we shared. We ordered the Guava Chiffon Pancakes and the Teriyaki Loco Moco. Both were delicious and hit the spot ! Everyone here was really kind and the staff always checks to see if we're doing ok.   I highly recommend that you guys check this place out ! You won't be disappointed ! :)",

    "text": "Came here for the first time with my friend for brunch. Wasn't busy, probably since it's quite new. I was born and raised in Hawaii but haven't ever been to the original location so I was excited that they opened one here in Vegas.   Atmosphere and decor is nice, they have \"aloha\" and \" e komo mai\" signs up here and there. I'm sure over time some of the open spaces on the walls will be filled up.   This time around we had the guava chiffon pancakes (which I was excited to try), the kalbi loco moco, and a side of fried rice. Loved the pancakes. I love all things guava and this was something I've always wanted to try, knowing they existed at the Kailua location. The fluffy pancakes have a hint of guava and the stack is covered in a sweet guava cream sauce with a hint of tartness. We had the full stack without realizing the size of pancakes - they're quite big. If you are planning to try other items along with the pancakes I suggest getting the short (2) stack.   The kalbi loco moco was good. Meat was very soft and instead of gravy it was covered in the kalbi glaze. Good choice but I think I will try something else next time, perhaps the kalua pig eggs Benedict.   Workers are all very nice, service is great. The food was served on plates made from palm (that I assume they will be recycling), which was a nice touch. Pricing isn't on the cheap side, but it's a nice place to visit once in a while. We wanted just a little bit of sauce to go with the leftover pancakes but unfortunately they charge $1.50 for extra sauce, so that was a little bit disappointing.",

My bf got the banana pancakes. I'm so glad I didn't come here by myself because I would've been mad, honestly. Lol. It took almost an hour to get our food. I know they're new but that wait is ridiculous. Also, when we were handed our food, they didn't even apologize for how long it took. When I was handed my food, I noticed they gave me scrambled eggs... I don't like scrambled eggs... but I didn't complain because I didnt wanna wait another 30 mins to get my food back. So I just ate it. The eggs didn't taste like anything but the Portuguese sausage was amazinggg (the only reason for my 3 stars). The pancakes were good too.   Idk if I'll be back since this place is sooooo far & I was not impressed by them, but the Portuguese sausage was the best I've had in Vegas. Hopefully things improve.",

    "text": "Missing the broad side of a barn.  $3.25 for  cup of coffee and a SINGLE refill (they actually give you a chip to hand in if you want one).  $10 for guava chiffon pancakes with no breakfast meats and $1.50 for additional syrup?  No fresh fruits.  No vegan options.  No gluten free options.  Seriously, this is Vegas right?  While the norm in Hawaii, the concept doesn't work where off Strip dining is usually 30% less costly.  Neither does ignoring what is common place for breakfast joints in the city.  One plus, the food isn't microwaved like the flagship Kailua location.    To the food, the guava chiffon pancakes are smaller but at least the syrup (excessively sweet and tasting like boiled out guava nectar from Hawaiian Sun [tm]), is served on the side on request.  Unfortunately, the pancakes don't taste made from scratch, rather made from a mix.  Glutinous, chewy sponges that soak up the syrup.     The bennies (kalua pig and crab cake) are just OK.  The first, salty with a hint of liquid smoke, the latter with more imitation crab and fillers than real crab meat.  The English muffin was soaked in butter substitute and the hollandaise served at room temp.  Don't get me started with the side of skillet potatoes made with tater tots.  The most inventive dish, the boneless kalbi loco moco, was the clear favorite.  It's name is misleading.  It is a kalbi plate lunch.  Well marinated, cooked through kalbi, an inverted bowl of fried rice ($2 extra),with two eggs.  Strange combination of flavors but it kinda works.  Cut everything up, mix it through to compensate for the fried rice being poorly mixed during cooking (white in some areas, lots of soy sauce in others), not bad.    Service is friendly with a definite Hawaii feel.  Wishing them all the best but for now, missing the mark.  Someone needs to do their homework, check out the competition, and make appropriate changes to better meet the Vegas off Strip dining scene.",

    "text": "2 stars versus 1 star because the girls who work here were very apologetic for such a long wait for the food.  So when you walk in, you order your food at the register and then you seat yourself kind of deal. Luckily I came here with my girlfriends because if I was alone and waited for food for OVER 45 minutes, I would've demanded my money back.   Anyways. As said above. It took forever for food to come out. But I was thinking, \"Okay, they just opened up not too long ago. They're probably still trying to get it together. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt if the food is bomb.\" But... wrong.  I ordered the Guava Chiffon pancakes short stack and that was probably the only good thing about my meal. It came out first before the crab cake benedict and kalua pig benedict I had ordered. I couldn't even finish the short stack but I'm glad I didn't order more.  Both of the benedicts and the rest of my friends' food had come about 5-10 minutes after the pancakes. First off. The food was way too salty. Like I legitimately got high blood pressure just eating the pounds of salt they put in their food (or I probably was just angry that the food had taken so long to get to the table and have it taste the way it did). And also. The food was lukewarm, closer to being cold. Not even hot. If I'm waiting for years for food to come out, at least have it hot, fresh, and ready, please? Lukewarm IS NOT cute.  Don't know if I should have said something while in the restaurant but it probably wouldn't have been a good idea seeing how hard the girls were working to apologize to customers, etc.   I had high hopes for this place but it was just way too hyped up. Probably won't be coming back.",

    "text": "I had a doctor's appointment on this side of town and decided to look up a place to eat. Cinnamon's popped up and I was excited as I love Hawaiian food.   I really really really really wanted to like this place. But alas I didn't like it at all. :/ Yes it was one of this experiences...:(  It's a weird set up... You walk in and then walk through the dining area to the counter to place your order and pay. They then you give you a number which you place on your table. They then bring you your food. They had their menu up on the wall behind the counter but it was easier to just look at the laminated menu.  The restaurant was cute... But it had more of a country restaurant feel rather then a Hawaiian restaurant...I guess the Hawaiian music helped but it felt a little disjointed as I kept on feeling like I was in a country store. Ambiance (2.5/5)  As soon as I walked in a guy greeted me and asked me if it was my first time. He then explained to me how the restaurant was set up. He was very friendly but he did make a mistake on my order which I questioned.  I guess it's like if a customer has a question don't scan her card then ask her what's wrong. I questioned why my total was so high, then he scanned my card then he asked me what did I mean? I told him to forget it. Cuz it's such a pain to have to go through and rescan my card and try to get the money back on it. He basically charged me for a side of rice...I guess the customer is always right but I got the loco Moco and it comes with rice so why would I want another side of rice? It's like asking for a side of toast with your burger. :/ He did tell me that he could take it off BUT that was after he had already scanned my card. I guess reading my order back to me before charging me is something he was never trained to do. :( But besides that the service was decent. Service 3/5  As stated above I ordered the loco Moco and paid $2 extra to get the Kim chi fried rice instead of plain rice. Let's just say it wasn't worth it. Maybe it's cause I'm Korean and had certain expectations for Kim chi fried rice... But this was just very salty. And when you say Kim chi fried rice make sure that there is more then 4 pieces of Kim chi in the fried rice. :/ The bacon was a nice touch and so was the spam but it did not taste like Kim chi fried rice. It tasted like regular fried rice with some pieces of Kim chi thrown in. The sauce was just brown sauce that could've come from a packet and yes it was salty as well. The hamburger patty was good though. It was a little bland but with the brown sauce it was almost balanced out. Eggs were cooked perfectly over easy. Overall, I would not get this dish again. It was a salt bomb. And I really wished that I could taste the Kim chi. 2/5  I also got their coffee which was decent... But for 3.25....I expected free refills like any other normal restaurant but you only got 1 refill. It was served in a to go cup which was nice touch... But I gotta say even if it was Kona coffee... When your coffee prices are more expensive then Starbucks prices.... Not a great way to go. Price...2/5  With other places that offer better Hawaiian food like island style... This is a pass for me.",

They brought out a sample of the banana fosters pancake which was delicious. We ordered the guava pancakes and chilaquiles. The portions are nice and big. The guava chiffon pancakes were sooo good they tasted like they might of had cream cheese in the sauce on them! The chilaquiles had a green and red sauce on them, I chose to have my egg fried and kalua pork on them. The pineapple pico was a really great addition as well. I would have loved if they had a homemade salsa or hot sauce, because I like my food spicy, but nothing a little Tabasco couldn't solve. Everything was delicious and service was good will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu.",

Since we left Hawaii, we always miss their red velvet pancakes and eggs benedict with home fries! But one day my husband was told about this location from his coworker from Hawaii, we decided to try their new location.  I was impressed by modern but little bit Hawaiian country ish layout and decor which was little bit different from their dingy Kailua location. We were able to shit down right away and the service was pretty good... They came to ask if we needed something pretty often and always friendly.    My eggs benedict with salmon came out great, as same as the ones I loved in Kailua. Yum!   Mahalo for bringing Cinnamon's to Vegas! We will go there every weekend from now on :)",

GUAVA PANCAKES!!!!!   I have always wanted to try this in Hawaii whenever I visit but never got a chance to, finally got to try it and i finally understand what the hype is all about .   First off, their servings are HUGE, a bit on the pricy side but it'll all makE sense once you see your plates lol. The Kalbi loco moco was so flavorful and so ono!! Didn't think I'd want kalbi for breakfast but with their well flavored kalbi with an upgraded kimchi fried rice...., I felt like i died and went straight to Aloha Heaven on the first bite ! They also had a great variety of Hawaiian Sun drinks which is a staple for me . Then there comes the Guava pancakes, super fluffy pancakes dousted with Guava syrup. It wasn't overpowering at all and not too sweet, plus  their pancakes are more flavorful and fluffier than their close by competitor's. And again... GUAVA PANCAKES! Get them , like now.   Will def be back, can't wait to try the rest of the menu , lol. Also my friend got the crab cakes and red velvet pancakes which were really good  Like i have said only down side are the prices, servings are huge but a bit in the steep side for breakfast .",

First time I was in a steak and eggs mood and boy the fresh wasabi is a nice touch - don't be scared, it's actually quite mild compared to the paste that you get with sushi . I've also tried the Kalua pork and the kalbi, which are both spot on flavorful!  Their hollandaise is a nice compliment with a good touch of citrus which I find most places miss.",

I love pretty much anything with guava so I had to come here since they have guava chiffon pancakes. When I first entered the restaurant, I was a little confused. I thought it would be a sit down type of restaurant. Nope. You order from the counter, take a number, and the server will bring out your food. The employees were kind and helpful. It was still their soft opening. They were out of Eggs Benedict and my friend was so disappointed. So he ordered an omelette instead. My husband and other friend ordered a Loco Moco. With our coffees and drinks, the total came out to be almost $65 for four people.   We sat down and a reasonable time later, we received our food. Initially, I was confused at the paper plates, plastic forks, and plastic knives. It's not going to break my meal but for the price, I thought they would bring out real plates and silverware. The guava pancakes were pretty big for a short stack which consisted of two large, fluffy pancakes. It was a little too sweet for me and it was underwhelming. I took a bite of the Loco Moco. I wish I had ordered that instead. My husband doesn't really like to share food so I just ate one pancake. I didn't finish them since I didn't really enjoy them. One of the employees (either a manager or owner) came by to check up on us while we were eating so that was nice. I'm not rushing to come back here.",

Also the food was delicious . I took our servers advice and got the loco moco with the spare ribs it tasted delicious !  My date got this Hawaiian chili and it had really yummy chips and sauces . It was not something I'd order again but if you're into that sort of stuff it tastes pretty good .  For the quality of service and food this place is a win!

    "text": "I went to Cinnamon's for breakfast on a weekend because the food looked so good in the pictures.  Upon arriving, I noticed the lovely decor (island chic, very welcoming). There seemed to be some hullabaloo at the front entrance with parties being seated. I waited my turn and was promptly seated. The hostess was very kind and gave me the specials for lunch as it was exactly 11 am.  As I was looking over the menu, a young lady came by to take our table's drink order.  We ordered coffee with half and half. Upon her return, she took our food order and I reminded her that we needed half and half.  Our food came out and I reminded her a second time. While she got that we looked at our food, the orders were correct.  I had ordered the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs (served with a side of country tots) and a short stack of the guava chiffon pancakes. My companion had ordered the kalbi ribs and eggs with a side of tomatoes (off menu and with an upcharge because the dish comes with a choice of starch).  The cream finally came out and we dove in.  1) The guava pancakes were such a let down. They are just regular pancakes with a sauce on top.  It tasted very yogurt-y and I couldn't eat it. 2) The Portuguese Sausage was decent. It would be better if they left it on the grill just a bit longer. 3) The \"Country\" Tots were over cooked tater tots with pieces of bell pepper and onions.  I was expecting the tots to be transformed somehow or at least cooked decently. 4) Eggs were scrambled and ok. 5) The Kalbi ribs were sent back. They tasted as if they had been marinating too long in the fridge.  This was a real shame because they looked grilled perfectly.  The dish was replaced with Portuguese Sausage.  Overall, the concept of the restaurant is good. It reminded me of BabyStacks down the road.  The food quality, however, needs work. When the food is processed (tots) and its still not right, that's a problem.  The manager should consider doing rounds to check on tables. If I saw someone at my restaurant with food barely touched I'd be asking questions.",

    "text": "I had never heard of this restaurant until I saw it on the news on St Patty's Day, serving up some green treats by the Chippendales. I figured I would have to come try it after that. My husband and I decided to go try it out one morning since he had a day off during the week. We figured it would be the best time to go since we saw that it can get pretty busy on weekends. Luckily we went when we did because it wasn't very busy and we got seated right away. There were so many good looking things on the menu, we had a hard time picking something. He is a huge fan of loco moco and having multiple options for that, made it a hard decision. He decided to go with the kal-bi and he was in heaven. He absolutely thought it was the best he's ever had. (and he orders loco moco everywhere we go) Reminded him of the food he had when he was visiting the islands. Now, he's excited to go back to try the other options they have. I love all benedicts, so I was excited to see that I had options as well. I tried the kalua pig benedict and it was sooo good. I did notice everybody around us having the pink pancakes which I think are the guava ones. I'm kind of bummed that I didn't get those, (after seeing half the people in the place with them on their tables) that I didn't even know what they were, but that will just give us an excuse to go back so we can try them. We did try their ginger ale. That was very different. Very sweet, but gingery. To me, it tasted like rice pudding. I know. That's weird to say, but that's what I got from it. Can't say I loved it, but I didn't hate it. It was just very different and something you have to have a taste for. My husband being the big coffee person he is, gave their coffee a try, but didn't really like it. It didn't taste like anything special. I definitely can't wait to go back and try the pancakes. The staff there is super friendly, had suggestions for us when we were stumped on which breakfasts to order and were always checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything else.",

    "text": "Quite possibly one of the most overhyped places I have been to in Vegas. Can't believe how disappointing this was. The fact they were voted one of the best places for pancakes and Hawaiian food is crazy. Was served bottled orange juice (at least could have poured it into a cup first!) and a mess of a plate. Ordered Portuguese sausage, eggs and tots for the little one along with blueberry pancakes. Sausage was over done and greasy, eggs were fair (my little one loved them) and the tots were... well they were tots. The plate came out so sloppy and unappealing. The pancakes had about 5 blueberries in them and were flat and flavorless. Took 3 or 4 bites and gave up. My wife had the \"famous\" guava pancakes and said they were meh as well. She only enjoyed them a bit because they reminded her of the ones she used to eat when she was a kid.  Service was meh.. nothing to talk about. Not sure if they were short staffed or what but when we got there they said it would be a 45 minute wait but most likely they would seat us sooner. We sat there and waited as tables sat empty and they tried to phone people that had put their name down in front of us who probably got scared away by the wait times they were giving. I don't think I've ever been told 45 minutes at a breakfast spot that didn't have a line of people waiting outside. We were the only people there at that time waiting. I think we waited about 10-15 minutes before being seated. I'm sure they lost a good amount of business by giving long wait times. Saw a couple of people come in after us and leave when they were told 40+ minutes even though they had seats sitting open.   Maybe it was an off day for them but with so many great breakfast spots in town it's hard to see myself coming back. I don't like leaving negative reviews (and haven't left a review for anything in a while) but was very disappointed in this place that I was so excited to try with all the positive reviews.",

I had the Moe moe moco (pronounced moy moy as in sleep) that includes lau lau, kalua pig, beef stew, choice of starch and Mac salad. The beef stew was ok but only included 2 very small pieces of beef, the kalua pig and lau lau was very dry and no flavor as if it was store bought and reheated kind of dry, the omelet was not an actual omelet that I'm used to where the egg wraps the other ingredients but instead; mixed into the scrambled eggs and fried. On the plus side the pancakes were fine (buttermilk), wish I tried the other flavored pancakes but don't think I'll will make an effort to. I would compare the environment to a iHop but a bit more pricey, frankly I'd go to iHop next time ",

What boggles my mind is that while MALASADAS are a classic Portuguese favorite, they're only available on Wednesdays!  If you're open 7am to 3pm, and i have a job...  GAH!   Why? Why not have MALASADAS on the weekends???    Restaurant by same name, similar menu, different coffee and just that much off...  make it not.  Lower your expectations to appreciate this one.",

We got the kalbi with kimchi fried rice and egg, the Guava pancakes (which was ranked #8 in the nation!), and traditional eggs benedict. Everything was very flavorful and satisfying! I did however wish the food came out more warmer since our plates  seem to be luke warm.  The kalbi was marinate to perfection. The meat was tender and juicy. The kimchi fried rice was cooked just right without the kimchi overpowering the taste. The guava pancakes was good but a little too sweet for my taste. I recommend getting the half order. The fluff of the pancakes were on point though! The eggs benedict was delicious and it came with tater tots!   the server and staff were very friendly! I will definitely be coming back for more!",

    "text": "This review was also posted to their Facebook page. Putting one star so people can see there are still hour long wait times for breakfast.   My three children and I had brunch here yesterday to celebrate Mother's Day early and try to skip the crazy restaurant crowds Vegas usually has on holidays. We were seated at 11:30, ordered our food at 11:35 and we were served at 12:31!!! Thank goodness my three children are extremely well behaved, even though my two year old was understandably getting anxious. While we were sitting there quietly and obviously upset with three frowning, hungry children, nobody approached us to apologize for the wait until 47 minutes of waiting (by this point I started checking my watch). At 51 minutes, the manager came by to apologize for the wait as well because they were \"really busy\". There were eight tables total in my area and only 2/8 of those tables were served their food. The table next to me that finally got their food were waiting as long as we were.   There was another customer who made a big stink about the wait and got up to leave a couple of times but his wife stayed behind so he and his son eventually came back and were finally served their food. The manager spoke to him apologizing a few times and then I hear that customer got a 20% discount to \"make up for the wait\" but myself nor the other customers sitting next to me got that same discount. Because we were being polite and waiting patiently? That's really unfair. I would never ask for a discount for a long wait time but to not be offered one because I didn't make a big scene about it isn't fair at all.   The Kailua location was one of our family's favorite places to go when we were living in Hawaii. After seeing the mixed reviews when this place first opened, I held off on visiting for a few months to give them time to work out their kinks but a 50+ minute wait for breakfast food is unacceptable. I just saw other reviews from over three months ago complaining about the same thing and it's an issue that still isn't fixed yet. Go to Baby Stacks if you want great food and quick service. They constantly have lines out the door but you will never wait more than 20 minutes for your food.",

The Chiffon gave me a pleasant cheesecake experience which was interrupted, not rudely mind you, by intermittent, sweetly, slightly acidic guava sauce. Pancake batter was soft but had good bounce.

    "text": "We decided to give this breakfast eatery a try after hearing from my coworkers and reading the Yelp reviews. The place was easy to find and there was lots of parking. We were promptly greeted with an \"Aloha\" from the hostess. The place was well designed and clean. Our waitress was very nice and laid back since we took our time figuring out what we wanted. The side of crab cakes was nicely done: lightly crisp with a well balanced approach to the seasonings and crab ratio. The sauce compliments the crab cakes. The side of Kim-chee fried rice was a little too light tasting with the Kim-chee flavor, but I understood how they needed to keep the taste more subtle so more people can enjoy it. The Guava Chiffon Pancakes was simply delicious! It had a nice sweet taste with a slight tang right at the end of the experience. I didn't like the Pistachio Cream Pancakes as much as the Guava Pancakes, but a couple of the members in our party loved it. The Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict was very interesting with the kalua pig being the center of the taste attraction. The Carsie's Kal-Bi Loco Moco I liked the best. It was very tasty. I'd like to try the OMG Wasabi rib-eye next time.",

I came in looking forward to some loco moco and pistachio cream pancakes. We were seated by a inconsiderate hostess. Then our waiter came over five minutes later with cups of ice water asking if we were ready to order. We were, but what about asking if we want something to drink when we first sat down? You just assumed that I wanted water with ice ok..??  We corrected him. We give our orders and 15 minutes later he comes back by stating that there is one ticket in front of us. Ok thanks for the heads up. How long is a few minutes. Another 15 minutes passed and here comes the food!!!! Yay finally. I took one bite of it Ice cold. I'm thinking maybe it's just one part of it. Nope both our meals and the pancakes were cold. So disappointed and no one even seemed to care .They offered to make it again, but our waiter rolled his eyes. He didn't even apologize. The best part is no manager was on duty. No wonder there was so much attitude. We walked out. Shameful. Disappointed and I WILL NOT be back because the service was disgraceful.",

We waited 20 mins for a table while there were 6-8 open tables. Once seated the ticket times were running about 20-25 minutes, which is way to long for breakfast.

    "text": "It's early Monday morning and the fiance and I are still tired yet hungry from the weekends activities. Breakfast naturally comes to mind. The fiance immediately searches yelp for a few recommendations when he comes across \"Cinammon's\". You mean, Hawaii's own Cinnamons? I couldn't believe it, so without hesitation, off to Cinnamons we go.   We entered the establishment across from Trader Joe's, and it was pleasant with an Aloha vibe. The hostess immediately seated us with a smile and asked if were locals, since I assume there are many out of town visitors. I'm surprised to see it isn't busy, but then again it is Monday and it is back to school (something I don't mind as much).   We are handed the menu as I order their Kona coffee. I notice the menu isn't obnoxiously long with pages of food. I prefer a short menu since I know the back of house usually focuses on flavor and presentation, not to mention timeliness when the menu isn't as extravagant.   How can I choose from all the yummyness? So we decided on: 1. Short stack of guava pancakes 2. Short stack of pistachio cream pancakes 3. Full order of Kalua pig eggs Benedict with tots 4. A side of kimchi fried rice.  Let's review!!!  1. The guava pancakes had a nice presentation with guava sauce slathered and a generous dollop of whip cream to top it off. The pancakes were  moist and fluffy and the guava sauce complimented it nicely with a sweet and tart kick. Delicious! Just make sure to have a glass of milk or coffee near by since the pancakes will definitely choke you with goodness!  2. The pistachio cream pancakes were unique and just as delicious. These were moister than the guava 'cakes since it looks like the pistachio flavor was infused in the actual pancakes and again drizzled over the top with cream and a generous sprinkle of pistachios. WOW!!! These are a party in your mouth, but don't forget to sip on some coffee with each bite to help you swallow!!!  3. A full order of the kalua eggs Benedict is two benedicts instead of 1. I recommend the full order since these are irresistible. The kalua pig itself is super tender and moist (I love that word) and slightly salty. A great combination with eggs and their creamy hollandaise sauce. The eggs were poached perfectly with a nice runny yolk to add additional creaminess to coat your mouth. The side of tots were probably one of my favorites I've had in a while. They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with a lovely saute of peppers and onions. Great compliment to the dish as it adds texture to the soft tenderness of the pork.  4. The kimchi fried rice is a burst of flavor in your mouth. A bit salty and tart from the kimchi is a tasty flavor profile that would probably taste best with sunny side up eggs and a protein of choice. Accompany the rice however you choose, it is delectable regardless!  ***extra.... the Kona coffee had a sweet roasted aroma and tasted even better. Smooth finish and served in a to go cup, which I didn't mind since I sipped on it almost all day. It was, however, slightly pricey at almost $5!!!!   Cinnamon's is a breakfast joint I'll be revisiting soon, since there are tons of other options I'd love to try. It is a quaint, clean, and friendly environment, prompt service, and an overall comfortable ambiance. Our total came out to about $36 before tip, just about $18 pp, not the cheapest, but definitely affordable if you're looking at it in a quality perspective. We ended up with leftovers, but if you love \"super sized\" meals, you may want to order more dishes. I can't wait to see more Cinnamon's pop up through out the rest of the valley, making it a staple on the 9th island.",

I been here a couple times and each time I got the crab cake Benedict. Bomb! It is fresh, made with so much crab, and it's real crab! I just get half order because that is all I need.   I get their coffee, best coffee out there made just by them. If you like it as well, you can actually buy it from them, can't find it anywhere else.   The guava pancakes is delicious. But a warning, it is pretty sweet. The actual pancake is so fluffy though. I also got the pistachio pancakes, it isn't as good as the guava, and next time I will try the red velvet pancakes and see if that compares to Babystacks.   My beau got the prime rib loco moco and that thing is a huge portion! He loved it. He got it with gravy once and the other time he got it with au jus sauce and he liked it way better with the au jus.   I'm not a real breakfast type of person but I do see myself coming back here soon.",

The burger patty is seasoned with onions and other ingredients which makes this dish great! You can't go wrong with the fried rice either! There was bacon and Portuguese sausage in it! They have pancakes too! Not a fan of pancakes, but they looked good from what I saw! There is a lot on the menu board so I know I have to come back again!

It was a bit odd though bc I saw lots of seats available? That wasn't anything too major since we were taking our time looking at the menu anyway.   My partner and I ordered two similar dishes, he got the Kalbi plate with a price upcharge of kimchi fried rice as substitute while I got the Kalbi loco moco. I overheard someone ask what's the difference between these plates and the server said \"presentation\". In the kalbi plate everything is on their own while in the loco moco the rice is placed under the meat and the egg goes on the very top. I also assumed loco moco always came with gravy but not in this case.   I had questions myself as I saw in Yelp photos they appeared to have macaroni salad but they didn't have it listed on the menu as a side or extra. The server said that it only comes with the loco moco. So FYI.   Both dishes were very delicious. The kalbi was a bit sweet for my liking but it balanced out with the rice. The macaroni salad was pleasant as well. I had a taste of my partner's kimchi fried rice, it looked like it included chipped up sausages.   The guava chiffon pancakes were amazing also. I thought they would be guava infused pancakes but I believe they were just buttermilk pancakes with a beautifully pink cream sauce all over it with whip cream. It was fluffy and soft and really divine. It was tangy and reminded me of a cheesecake.   Our server Jill kept checking up on us and was great.",

In fact, both our Host & Waitress were very friendly & attentive. Yes, your food doesn't come out as quick as it would if you were at Denny's- but it's well worth the wait.   Coffee was a bit pricey, but it's really good Kona coffee- if you appreciate a good cup of quality coffee (with one refill), then you won't mind the price.  Breakfast itself was definitely on the expensive side, but well worth it for this So Cal family who eats Hawaiian food regularly~ we'll most definitely be back!!!",

Moms - kalbi & eggs...tasty just like the ribeye. Hubs - Hawaiian omelette...not good at all. Lack of flavor, just bleh!! Eggs were overcooked & spongey. Brown rice was not cooked well and was very hard. Me - corn beef hash benedict...I've never had sweet benedict's before. The hollandaise sauce was cinnamon-y sweet with a taste of mustard. I HATE MUSTARD! This was an absolute NO for me and everyone at the table. Lastly, we shared the guava & red velvet pancakes and they were both good. Nothing spectacular. Cinnamon's in Kailua is 100% better! If our food arrived in a timely manner, I would've given 1 more star, but 45 minutes for breakfast is excessive!",

    "text": "Note: It's been a few months since my husband and I attempted to dine here. I have waited to write the review since I didn't want it to come from an angry place. Hopefully my reaction now is reasonable lol.   I was excited to try out Cinnamon's since I enjoyed their Waikiki location and shared their opening news with out-of-town friends who would be visiting us. Unfortunately, Cinnamon's left us very disappointed and I will not be going back. Reading other reviews, I knew to be patient with the service. A very large party had come in right before us, the staff told us that they had no warning of them and they had taken up one side of the restaurant. They said the wait on food would be longer than usual (about 30 minutes), which we were fine with. We placed our order and received our # and receipt. I wanted to grab something already made and small to tide us over in the meantime, so I ordered a slice of banana bread separately. The cashier put that on the same # as our original order. The banana bread was delivered a few minutes later and I made sure to tell the server that delivered it that this was not our full order, and we were waiting for the items we ordered on our first receipt so there was no confusion. She let us retain our # card. 30 minutes came and went and still no food. We started seeing others who had ordered after us get our food, so we brought this to the attention of the original server who delivered my banana bread and one of the servers wandering around (they didn't seem to have any dedicated servers to a table, it looked like any one could hop in and help you). For the next 30 minutes, we realized all the servers around us were actively avoiding our table, refilling the waters of everyone else around us, but not our table and avoiding eye contact with us even when we tried to flag them down. No one seemed to want to take responsibility for our order. We talked to the cashier who originally took our order and said it would be right up and there was a mistake and our ticket was lost. Another 30 minutes pass. I was shocked to see that they didn't make our ticket a priority, as they continued to provide food to others who ordered after us. We spoke with the assistant manager who apologized and said she would check on our food again. At this point it had been 90 minutes since we ordered and we really were tired of waiting and asked for a refund. She offered us a bag of chips for our next visit, but I thought that was a big assumption to make on her part that we could come back again. I know she meant well, but our time was wasted and it was bizarre that the staff was avoiding taking the reigns to resolve the issue. We asked to speak with the restaurant manager. The manager came from out of the kitchen with a \"What more do you want from us?\" attitude, even though this was literally the first time we were speaking to him. I was trying to explain to him the most upsetting issue regarding the service and he just didn't seem to care and seemed like we were bothering him.  My biggest gripe was that I had foreseen this issue and proactively spoke to a server about it to make sure our ticket did not get lost. The assistant manager was much more concerned and apologetic, letting us know the staff would be retrained on these escalated issues. We left the restaurant very frustrated and hungry, but at least we got to try out The Bagel Cafe nearby. I know there can be a lot of issues with franchise expansions, but this location did not have the aloha spirit and service I saw in Hawaii or that I would expect from any business.",

    "text": "This place is fairly new and they're doing very well. It's not your usual restaurant: you walk in, order first, then you seat yourself. The cashier said it'll be a 45 minute wait for our food... they weren't kidding. I had to keep reminding myself that the crab cake benedict is work the 45 minutes wait, but boy, was I hungrrrryyyyy.   My friend received her food first and I was so tempted to start picking off her plate because of how hungry I was (sorry not sorry). The runner seemed a bit confused with what she ordered... She ordered the kalbi loco moco & he said she got kimchi fried rice under the kalbi (she freaked out a little bit). It ended up being just regular rice, like she wanted. I finally got my food and inhaled it. I got the 1/2 order of crab cake benedict -- side note: it's only one half the English muffin & one egg; if you want two English muffin halves & two eggs (like a normal benedict), you have to order the full order. The tater tots that came with the benedict were so crunchy and fresh, I could eat those for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   You also have to try the guava pancakes. It's delicious and not too sweet!  The general manager came by every table to make sure the food was okay, which was nice, especially since they just opened. Good customer service, overall.   I greatly enjoyed the food here, I just wish the wait wasn't so long and this place wasn't on the opposite side of town. A Cinnamon's needs to open on the Southwest side!",

    "text": "The service is Hawaiian-style friendly but the prices are inflated like we're still on an island in the middle of nowhere. I'm not a fan of being nickle and dimed, and here that seems to be the specialty: over $3 for a cup of basic house coffee with only a single refill, a charge for extra syrups, nearly $4 to add tomato slices to a Benedict, $2 more to add mushrooms and onions to a prime rib omelet that arguably should include them in the first place, and an absurd egg white substitution fee. Even if I could get behind the charges, serving up meals over $10 on disposable plates is just cheap. And it makes no sense considering the upscale interior and metal cutlery. Newsflash, we're not in Hawaii any more.   The food was okay. I'm used to Hawaiian food being on the salty side, but even ordering the breakfast specials there was a bit too much. The crab cake Benedict has a fairly good flavor, as does the garlic-cilantro salad dressing, but the hollandaise was super salty and the crab cake itself was an odd green color consisting mostly of filler causing it to resemble falafel. But it tasted fairly good.   I work nearby and might pop in again for breakfast or lunch, but it won't be the first place I think of returning. Props for offering half-portions for several dishes, wish they would add fresh fruit as a side option. They are also adding baked goods to the menu soon.",

One of the first few ppl there and was told they were out of Kalbi. Weird. Sucks too since I was planning on ordering that. Anyways, we ordered the Guava Chiffon Pancakes(really good), Red Velvet Pancakes(cake-like but good), Banana Pancakes(good), Crab cake Benedict & Tots(very good except the crab cake had an overly-fishy taste to it-if that makes sense), and Prime Rib & Eggs(horrible!) It was the most expensive thing we ordered but the worst tasting. VERY dry & bland! Overall the food was \"okay\". But what saved me from giving it less stars was the service-sad but True. VERY friendly staff and our waitress always made sure we were ok. Not sure if I'll be back again any time soon but maybe in the future we'll give it another try. Maybe they just need more time to improve the food??? Only time will tell...  *What struck me as a little weird(have never dined at Cinnamon's before) was ordering at the counter when we walked in, paid for the food, got a number & found a table. They brought over our food & drinks but we dined with paper plates, paper cups, and plastic cutlery",

    "text": "Food was good. Not thrilled with how the situation was handled when our order came out wrong. I ordered Eggs Benedict. 1/2 regular, 1/2 tomato and spinach added. The order came with both having tomato and spinach.  Then waitress said she'd be right out with a corrected Benedict. She comes back and wants the plate I'm eating off of to remove the 1/2 Benedict.  She says they can't replace the Benedict until they have the half they got wrong with spinach and tomato.     So, not only did they get my order wrong, my brother can't eat his crepe because it's got spinach and tomato on it, and I can't eat mine because they want their Benedict back.   Just bring a 1/2 plain benny!  Good food.  Bad policy.",

They don't have the extensive menu as in Hawaii but they did have the guava pancakes. Had the boneless kalbi loco moco and husband had the eggs Benedict with bacon and Turkey. Everything tasted great the staff was great and the musician's we great. Not a long wait as we expected, since in Hawaii you are looking to wait an hour or 2. Will definitely come back when in town.",

I wanted to try their guava chiffon pancake which my daughter ordered, and it did not disappoint. You can taste the guava on their sauce. What I had was the Kalbi, their short ribs are ribs, there was no bones on the beef servings.   Ambiance: As soon as you come in, reminds you of the Hawaiian Islands, with the kukui seeds and the Hawaiian music.  Service: Service was good, The general manager greeted us, and was hands with regards to service.  The payments were different though, instead of ordering from you table and paying on your table, the diner will have to pay at the cashier and then they serve the food at your table.  Overall: It was a good dining experience it was breakfast with a Hawaiian Flavor, especially the guava chiffon pancake.",

    "text": "Today was my first time trying out this place with my dad. A friend had referred me to this place, saying that their guava pancakes were amazing and I need to get them. This place is very close to our home so once I finally had the time to go today I decided to invite my dad along. This place used to be the Italian restaurant called Parma and they haven't changed much of the inside layout. They still had the little counter/fridge display with different Hawaiian canned drinks and pastries I believe. The manager told us there were two separate sections of the store, the quick order place or the sit down one and we opted to go to the sit down section.   My dad ended up getting their special today, it was the teriyaki meatloaf loco moco and I got the kalbi with 2 over-easy eggs, and brown rice and of course, we had to order the guava chiffon pancakes.   The portion sizes were pretty huge. I LOVED my kalbi! Lots of flavor, and very delicious. The brown rice actually paired really nicely with the meat and the eggs. My dad said he was expecting the meatloaf to be boring but he said he was really surprised and loved his as well! He said it had lots of flavor and was very unique.  The guava pancakes were great!! Loved the flavor and it was definitely something I've never had before. Guava fruit can sometimes be sour and tart but this one came out sweeter and more savory. The pancakes were a tinyyyy bit dry as it kept falling apart a little bit but just slather some sauce on there and you'll be fine   All in all, we had a great experience! The staff was super nice and helpful and definitely friendly. We really enjoyed our meal and would definitely be back sometime soon!",

Guava Chiffon Pancakes - Only got the short stack but was pleased nonetheless. Tartness of the guava nectar was offset by the sweet flavor of the sauce (which we got on the side). Kahlua Pork Eggs Benedict - Usually not a fan of Eggs Benedict in general, but these were really good. Kahlua was moist, not like most Hawaiian restaurants where the pork is too dry. We got it with Fried Rice, which was unexpectedly delicious. Had a hint of garlic taste to it. Kalbi Loco Moco - I had to order this with mushrooms and onions and what a great addition. Kalbi was tender and perfectly cooked. The amount of rice and eggs that came with the meal was generous. I would come back just for this alone, wow.  Also, the General Manager came by to our table and told us the backstory of the restaurant and asked how we heard of it. Really nice touch.  Would definitely recommend this place if you want to try a new brunch place.",

I hear if you're from Hawaii, this place tastes like home. I had the KALBI, fried rice and eggs. KALBI was delish but I do like my kalbi with bones. Ours also didn't come out as big as the others pictures here on Yelp. I also tried the GUAVA pancakes which were good but maybe taste better freshly made. I ate mine at the end of the meal so it wasn't warm anymore and my whipped cream had melted. Next time I'll eat it right when it comes and probably ask for light on the sauce. So see, it was good and there will be a next time. Wish there were later hours so my hubby can come. *GM very nice and has lots of history with the one in Hawaii.

The GM was super friendly as was our wonderful waiter Matt. They even brought out their signature pinacolada pancakes with a birthday candle and sang Happy Birthday, which made my mother-in-law's day. Wonderful food, superior service and great atmosphere!",

For dinner,I had the mahi-mahi with cream sauce and mashed potatoes. Which was out of this world good! They even had complementary wine which was a nice touch. The only thing I wish they had was a baby changing station in the restrooms. I will definitely be back because I hear their breakfast is really good also.",

    "text": "To be completely fair - I should probably start off by saying if your expectations are set to the Cinnamon's in Hawai'i you may come out disappointed.  The signature sampler was much more filling than I anticipated. Featuring one of each pancake: pistachio, red velvet, and guava - the dish definitely takes your taste buds on a wonderful ride. Of course with guava being my personal favorite.  The kalbi moco was decent. The kalbi was cooked perfectly. Although I do wish it had been marinated a little more to reflect the sweet & tangy flavor you expect from a kalbi rib. We added mushrooms and onions which, in my opinion, is what made the dish stand out. The teri glaze seemed a tad lackluster. The fried rice was my least favorite part of the dish. Not the traditional Hawaiian fried rice that we're used to. Our waitress had to run a knife through it to find the meat. I thought they had given us brown rice by mistake.  I also ordered a side of macaroni salad - which was tasty.  The food experience in itself was just okay. And I found it a little strange when the waitress ran a knife through my fried rice to make sure it was fried rice. However, if you do plan on stopping by, the guava pancakes come with my highest regard.",

I liked the fact that it was Hawaiian themed (I loooove Hawaiiii!) and it seemed like a nice mom and pop establishment (which I always try to support).  When we arrived, it was bustling and almost at full capacity. It looked like they were short of a few servers so we had to wait a little bit to be seated. We both ordered a short stack of pancakes (one regular, one guava) along with some other breakfast items (eggs, bacon, SPAM and potatoes).   Loved the grilled SPAM (who doesn't!?) and the tater tots/home fries were delicious as well. Only miss was the bacon which was a bit flavorless. Of course, the star of the show (pancakes) were phenomenal and the guava sauce was not overly sweet. The pancakes were soft and moist without being overly doughy. Service was fantastic and on point which is always a plus.   Will definitely come back if we're craving some hometown breakfast food!",

I was expecting a little spice and kick with the wasabi and it was very light. The steak was cooked well but lacked flavor. I had to add some hot sauce to get some heat. The guava pancakes saved the day. I am not really a pancake person but it added some sweetness to my breakfast. The service was great and our waitress took really good care of us.

We showed up and they already had a table all set up with waters for us. We never actually confirmed whether we'd be coming in but that was really nice to see and definitely made us feel welcomed.  We all ordered a variety of items, but between my bf and myself, we ordered 'da \"moe moe moco\"', the Hawaiian style omelette with a side of buttermilk pancakes (upgraded to the guava chiffon pancakes for $2), and a short stack of pistachio cream pancakes. Waaay too much food but everything was good. I highly recommend the pancakes here--the guava chiffon pancakes were phenomenal! Perfectly sweet and creamy sauce on top of huge fluffy pancakes. I actually thought the entrees were just okay, but the tots were really good and crispy! And as stated earlier, the service is awesome here! Cinnamon's is a great place for brunch.",

Kalbi loco moco with the kimchi fried rice upgrade was great! But the real star here was the pistachio pancakes - which I was lucky to try because my friend ordered them... Definitely will be coming back on my cheat day to grab some more.  The guava chiffon pancakes were ok, but paled in comparison to the flavor and topping of the pistachio pancakes. Also they were covered in the guava syrup while the pistachio cakes had crumbled (you guessed it) pistachios on top, as well as a drizzle of some sort of delicious pistachio butter cream No syrup needed!  Next time I'm on this side of town, I'll be sure to return :)",

The original Cinnamon's started out in Kailua, Hawaii, on Oahu about 15 minutes from where I grew up. The Kailua restaurant still has a long wait to get in on pretty much a daily basis. So it was nice to walk right in and get a table.  This Vegas location is owned by the same owner and run by some of its original Hawaii staff, with the same secret recipes, such as the Guava Cheffon pancakes, which is my personal favorite.  Of course they also have an awesome Loco Moco, along with a few variations.  My guess is, once the word gets out there will soon be a wait to get into this awesome place. So get in while you can get in quick.",

Had a small kine \"kanack attack\" when we left. We will definitely go back. The decor is very nice, simple With that touch of aloha. We also loved the local music played in the restaurant as well.   The general manager Marty made us feel welcome and greeted us with that warm aloha spirit that is much needed in Vegas. We could have chatted all morning.  Hospitality was warm and welcoming.

Cinnamons has a great atmosphere with very friendly servers and great selection of food that is super refreshing after seeing a lot of the same choices given over and over at regular chains. The Hawaiian influence is very obvious as soon as you enter the door as the whole decor is island themed. You have two selections when entering when you dine here, either go up to where they have a order  desk or dine in like a traditional restaurant which can be confusing if you are not used to coming here. The waiting area is tight we came around 11 am and it was packed already  and we were forced to wait around the entrance with 3 other families and it got pretty intimate. We waited around 10 minutes opting for the dine in experience and after sitting down our waitress came to take our orders.   Their in house coffee is great as it is made with kona beans which gives it a unique taste, I paired it off with a batch of the pistachio pancakes which are not as weird as you might think. The pancakes were nice and warm with a small green paste with bits of pistachios on top, the menu called them yummerz but let me say I can back this up and officially give it a yummerz approval. All in all this is a great breakfast/brunch spot that you should make the drive for.",

A waitress had to tell 2 other waitresses \"hey, can we get some help here in the front\" while them two seem like they were talking story. They didn't assist us first. They went to cleaning up tables, putting things away. Finally one of the girls came.up and called someone from the list (we didn't know there was a list or sign in sheet). The girls didn't greet anyone that was standing in line before us or at least said \"Hello, we will be right with you\". There was no acknowledgement at all. When we asked her how long the wait was for 2 people she said about 35 minutes because of other people that reserved for 16 people and 5 people and 2 people. It's like they didn't seat anyone in front of us because they were waiting for the \"reserved\" people to arrive. The restaurant wasn't busy, there was sooo many empty tables, no tables said \"reserved\" on it. We decided not to eat there and not sure if we will be going back. I heard service was bad from others and thought to give it a try and I'm so disappointed on how the place is being run. I'm hoping it will be better in the near future but they've been open for a while.",

I thought, what the heck, let's try their syrup. It was the best decision ever. I tried the French toast without the syrup first and they were so flavorful, when I dipped a piece in a little syrup, it was a game changer. You don't need too much syrup, it compliments the toast perfectly. The spam was cooked to perfection too. Thank you for your great service as well. You are greeted with an \"aloha\" each time you are met at your table. I was checked on just enough to where I felt I was being paid attention to but not too much where I felt I couldn't enjoy my meal. Such a great relaxing spot for breakfast!",

    "text": "My husband is a breakfast addict...so we decided to check this place out.   Surprisingly, not very busy at 11am on Easter Sunday.  But looking around, clearly a favorite breakfast place for the islanders.  We tried one of their specials, the house made corned beef hash and the crab cake benedict.  We also ordered a short stack of the guava chiffon pancakes.  We loved the house made hash, perfectly seasoned and just the right ratio of meat to potato.  The guava chiffon pancakes were super fluffy and not overly sweet even with the syrup and whip cream.  The pancakes and servings are ginormous...I would recommend half orders for those that tend to eat smaller portions.  I also like that they have a bunch of different starch options you can pick from, we were a big fan of their breakfast tots.  The tots were nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I think other options for the starch were toast, rice, brown rice, pancakes, and not a starch but available...salad.  The only reason I knocked off one star is the crab cakes.  I probably would not order the crab cake benedict again, the spinach did not pair well with the rest of the ingredients in the crab cake.  Overall, great service, we will be out again for our Hawaiian breakfast fix. Better than Babystacks cafe, in my opinion.",

Food good, but fried rice was salty under kalbi loco Moco. Sweetbread French toast was a little plain. No topping, like coconut or maybe the old standby powdered sugar? Menu designed to get you to add sides. No shoyu on tables. Have to ask. They are serving with metal flatware now. No sign of plastic, although plates still fancy paper.

I don't know who the manager is now but she didn't even come over to talk to us after the screwup in our order. I ordered a Farmer's omelet and received a Hawaiian. How this happened is beyond me. I even told the waiter I don't want tomatoes with the omelet. Also, I thought there would be potatoes with the omelet and toast but all I received was toast. The waiter said I didn't specify so they just game me toast. How was I to specify if I wasn't even asked?  The coffee mugs are way to small and the coffee is lukewarm when  served. Wouldn't it be better to have pots or thermos on the table instead of the server having to come over numerous times for refills?  Btw, the food is ok. Not great and not too bad but not worth the hassle.  I haven't been here in awhile since our last visit wasn't pleasant either but I decided to try again in case something changed.  Nothing changed and now I now NOT TO COME BACK AGAIN. Is this the way you want to deal with mistakes Miss Manager?",

The Kalua pork was nasty. The omelettes were rubbery and overcooked, The home fries were OK but had a very unappealing color! The eggs Benny were cooked nicely, but the hollandaise tasted like something that came in a jar. I honestly don't see why folks like this place.

My wife had Portugese Sausage & Eggs with a Pancake PLUS a side of rice.  Once we started eating we were caught off guard. The rice wasn't cooked. I was biting through and spitting out the hard grains. I informed our waiter and he brought us a fresh bowl of rice... Still not cooked.  I told the waiter again. He didn't offer a different solution. They have Brown Rice and Kimchi Fried Rice but I wasn't offered any of those for the inconvenience. It is what it is. So I just ate the Kalbi and eggs. Same with my wife. The good meats and pancakes made up for the uncooked rice.  Get this tho, the owner of the restaurant was sitting next to us and was listening to everything we were saying. He gave us a bag of coffee beans. I dont even have a coffee maker. But what a really nice gesture. Thanks Alika!   2nd visit (4/3/17)  Me: Kalbi Loco Moco & Blueberry Pancake Wife: Loco Moco & Pistachio Pancake And you guessed it, the rice was uncooked again!  Not as bad as before but you can tell there was still pieces of grain that had hard centers. They need a better rice cooker.  We informed the waitress.  She gave us a slight discount on our tab.   So after these 2 visits we agreed that we will not be coming back for a 3rd visit until the rice issue is fixed. So 3 Stars it is.",

Why not just duplicate what they have done in Kailua for 30 years? On a positive note the Portuguese sausage was great. Second time eating here and first time was about the same. They try to make it mainland style  why?",

Although everything I tried was fantastic (I went with 4 friends and we all taste tested everything) those guava chiffon pancakes were drool-worthy. The service was excellent and the place was super clean. It was pretty quiet, but hopefully that will change as people find out about it. I've told everyone I know already. Definitely my favorite new breakfast spot!",

Such a great restaurant, nice manager who welcomed us to, and just an overall excellent Aloha spirit.  Service was a tad slow (thus a 4 star score) which if on the islands would be par for the course but on the mainland could be stepped up a notch but definitely not something that will stop me from going back again and again and recommending this to my friends. Again,  Mahalo for a truly great Hawaiian experience.",

I also have to mention that I ordered my eggs over hard but didn't get them that way. The general manager Marty made it right by having new one brought right away and giving me a chip for a free short stack on my next visit.  We plan on coming back and maybe trying their red velvet pancakes so we can compare them to Baby stacks.",

Our party of two ordered the Hawaiian omelette with Pistachio cream pancakes and Crab cakes and eggs with Guava chiffon pancakes. The omelette was probably the best Kalua pig omelette we have ever eaten. It was so tender and tasty. The crab cakes were just as delicious, although a tad greasy, and the accompanying sauce had a spice that got my nose running. The pancakes, while very tasty, were not the best choice of a starch. It was just too much food. I recommend ordering pancakes on their own because they are quite large, about 8\" in diameter. The pistachio cream pancakes were our favorite. The guava chiffon pancakes were sweet and tangy, exactly as described. They definitely put the cake in pancakes.  We liked that this is a family owned establishment. Everyone on staff is friendly and helpful. The menu has a nice variety of Hawaiian favorites. We are sure to come back.",

What's up with ordering at the counter and seating yourself?  Paper plates?  Really?  As pricey as this food is, that's a real insult.  I was told that when they finally have counter service, only those who sit at the counter will have real plates and utensils.  WTF?  My Portuguese sausage and eggs were good, but come on, who can mess those up?  My guava chiffon pancakes were not cooked all the way through in the middle.  The server was really nice and apologized before getting me a new stack.  After reading some of these other reviews, they must be quite used to apologizing to their customers.  Has the franchise owner actually eaten at either of the Cinnamon's in Hawaii?  He should emulate those restaurants instead of doing his own thing here in Vegas.  It's not working!  Next time I want Cinnamon's, I'll wait til I'm back home and have the real thing.",

We were greeted by the friendly staff and manager once we got thru the door. We ordered and sat down. My daughter was getting a bit antsy, so I asked for some coloring material, and they didn't have any yet, but the manager was nice enough to get some paper and markers for my daughter till the food came, which was very kind. The food was definitely worth the wait, the guava pancakes and omelette especially! The manager came to check on the food as well as to see if there were any suggestions about the place which shows he really cares about the restaurant's success. We suggested the kid's coloring menu so kids had something to do while they wait. I realized I wanted a coffee once I sat down, but didn't want to stand in line again and order. I also told him people are going to want to stand in front of a nice big sign when they come to visit, and the location choice was great with Trader Joe's being next door. He appreciated the great feedback and even gave me a cup of the great coffee that they said they had shipped in from Hawaii. That coffee was awesome! I'll definitely be going back again!",

We were warmly greeted by the staff, and the manager offered to help with any questions we may have. We already knew what we wanted after checking over the menu online. We got the guava pancakes, and lox & cream cheese eggs benedict. While we waited, the general manager came up and offered to let us borrow his personal copy of the children's book that tells the story of how the restaurant got it's name, which our daughter loved as we awaited our food. It was a very warm, friendly dining environment that made us feel at home and welcome. The food came out in an appropriate amount of time, and I must say, the guava pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. That may sound like it's coming on a little strong and overstated, but I assure you, it is not. If you like guava, this is the breakfast treat for you. Normally, when I eat pancakes, I eat a couple bites but then get that heavy, awful feeling pancakes usually give you, but with these I just wanted to keep eating them. The eggs benedict were super delicious, as well. We're excited to come back and try the rest of the menu!",

The patties were burnt and didn't taste like homemade...pancakes were not good unless you poured alot of syrup on and this is mind you my first experience as I never had the chance to eat the one back in Kailua...We were there for the Aha Aina meeting and the manager himself looked disorganized. We know it was busy but that's not an excuse. The servers were nice and the one local girl who handled the orders with the kitchen knew what she was doing. I personally didn't like the fact we had to order in line and then wait for our food and that took almost half hour...you have servers..use them..they are only their to bring your food and water and even that was missed..I'll probably not be coming back as we can get better pancakes at baby stacks...there are other local places where food is better...I was was hoping this place was all that but it wasn't....hopefully they fix it.

    "text": "Heard about this place from our daughter in the morning while at the doctor.  Decided to find it an maybe try it out.  Easy to find, location not the best but inside the size of the place was very big and the atmosphere very nice.  Very limited on the decor because its new but nice, workers are very friendly and helpful.   Wife had the mixed plate of kalbi, fried rice, noodles (very small portion) and missing kim chee with very small pieces of spam that looked and tasted old.  Kalbi was very hard to chew and cut.  I had the farmers omelet which was good with (supposedly) buttermilk pancakes (2 ea), the pancakes tasted kinda bland or was it the syrup that was on the table.  Gave it a try, very funny taste and I'm unsure of what it was--a mix of lemon, maple, and whatever.  Coffee is very expensive and so are the refills--no free refills at this place.  Everything was served on a paper plate, why?  Total bill just for the wife and I came to nearly $35 and no discount.  IHOP this place is not.   I liked the waitress and work staff--very friendly and helpful (not to mention pretty).  They need real better cooks who know Hawaiian style foods-the ones that were there were not the best.  Will we go back-maybe not due to the very high prices just for breakfast and drinks.  Best advice-bring your own drinks or drink water with lemon--oops they might charge for the lemon.  Couldn't believe the cost of a small cup of coffee--WOW!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this is the soft opening for Cinnamon's. I kept an open mind after reading other reviews on yelp, especially since soft openings are meant to work out kinks and get feedback. This will be a long review, readers beware ;)   It's my first time here, and I heard from Hawaiian friends Cinnamon's is worth it. Friday morning at 8am, we had the place to ourselves. Walking in, I liked the space. The decor is nice, spacious enough to accommodate big parties without tripping over tables stuck too close together. We were greeted right away by one of the servers with menus in hand. She explained how to order (at the counter, then sit down with your number) and she gave us recommendations for popular menu items.   Marty the GM took our order at the register. He's very personable at all times, which I appreciate very much. It's one thing to offer customer service when something goes wrong, but to have that demeanor at all times is what impresses me.    Most important: the food! My mom and I ordered the Guava Chiffon and Red Velvet short stacks, a side of bacon and spam, and two coffees. The pancakes were cooked well and tasty! If I had to nitpick, I see how the Guava Chiffon pancakes can be overly sweet. We tend to order the fixings (sauce/syrup and whipped cream) on the side with pancakes anyway, and this helps to enjoy the pancakes and appreciate the sweet Guava sauce to your taste. The Red Velvet pancakes were very tasty, I prefer them to have the stronger coco taste as these did. They were slightly too crumbly, but the thicker cream cheese sauce remedies that. The bacon and spam were cooked perfectly, not too greasy, nice and crisp.   We didn't need the free coffee refill, one was enough for us but the server still offered anyway, asking if we wanted it to go (way to anticipate the guest needs!)   Service was great, even after the place started filling up. The servers kept checking on us, and Marty took the time to speak with us further. Cinnamon's values are apparent here: ohana and the aloha experience.   A couple of suggestions I hope the restaurant addresses: 1) the bamboo plates were ok, but I'd much rather have regular silverware and glassware instead of the plastic kind. 2) Almost all restaurants in Vegas offer complimentary water and free refills of coffee. This is the desert and a 24 hour town, we run on water and coffee! 3) Servers: give us your names! Your service is great, you're good at what you do, and I want to know your name. Especially if you offer, \"let me know if there's anything else I can get for you.\"  I'd rather not call you \"excuse me\" or  \"hey you\" :)   Thanks again for the great experience! We'll make the drive again and try the kalbi items next time.",

Was given a menu and was told they were out of Kalbi already, not a good start because I already went thru the menu online and had my taste buds for it. Decided to go with the Hawaiian omelet with the guava chiffon pancakes, not bad and it had a taste of Aloha in it but could have been better.   Also tried the Red Velvet pancakes, unfortunately it was too dry and almost cake like (not in a good way).  banana pancakes, was better  Kalua pig egg Benedict was really good, but crab Benedict had an odd taste, not sure how to explain, not \"bad\" but not something to talk about for sure.   Fried rice was probably the best item on the table for sure.  Not having table water is not an option or excuse for any restaurant and you feel a little forced to just buy Hawaiian Sun drinks or $2 bottle water just threw the whole first time experience out the door..  Everything seemed to be an \"add on\" for any substitutions for the already moderately priced menu items. So average entree will cost you $13-$16, which is more than the average really good breakfast chains.  Servers are nice with a little touch of of Aloha and probably saved the rest of our meals and experience,  much mahalos for that!",

She thought it would be more like a regular Loco Moco with gravy etc. but it was basically kalbi on top of kimchi fried rice with an egg on top.  It wasn't bad, but she would have preferred it to be more of a True Loco Moco style.  It was maybe $14 for this, so not cheap.  Decent Hawaiian breakfast food and the place was clean.",

It's awkward to have to stand in line to place your order and then go find a place to sit if you're planning to dine in. The food tasted ok, but the price points are off in some things such as their coffee. $3.45 for an average cup of coffee in a paper cup with only one refill is not worth it.  And like others, I don't care to be nickle & dimed, especially when their prices are already on the high side, especially when being served on paper plates. All of the pics of Kalbi & eggs shows fried rice. Well if you want fried rice, that's another extra charge...No thanks, I'll cook my own garlic fried rice!!!  The place has potential, but they need to consider the feedback from customers. I hope they make adjustments before it's too late.",

Food was very tasty.  My wife and I had the kalbi and eggs plate.  I had mine with fried rice.  Our kids had the hickory bacon and eggs.  We also ordered a short stack of pancakes with the guava chiffon toppings.  Everything was delicious!  Really no complaints and I'm sure we'll be back but somehow I think the food was a bit overpriced for what was offered.  Try it out and see for yourself.",

Call ahead of time since this place is typically always busy for breakfast/brunch and the parking lot is horrifically small for how many people head here.   Nice little Hawaiian eatery that graced its presence here on the 9th island as the local Hawaiians would call Vegas. The staff is very friendly and have great hospitality.    The coffee they brew isn't the crap you find at other breakfast eateries and if you want they do have Kona!   I always get the same thing when I'm there but that doesn't mean I haven't tried other offerings. I went with my normal Portuguese sausage and eggs with tater tots (yup freakin tater tots!). The food came out at a decent time and I really haven't waited long ever for the food to arrive here so that's a great thing when you have hungry breakfast peeps! The pancake list they have it's truly awesome in itself. They have everything from buttermilk to red velvet to macadamia nut etc...   All in all this place is super tasty and if you haven't been already stop in and try them out and support a local spot!",

What was weird was it was $2.75 to add spinach and tomato to a Benedict and $3.50 for house coffee. Benedict came out cold, and they were out of tots. Didn't have utensils, condiments, napkins, or anything on the table and we had to grab them off of another table.

We met the general manager who was very welcoming and genuine when asking how our experience was. The food was great. I got kalbi and eggs, and it was tender and perfectly delicious. Jack got the kalbi loco moco with kimchee fried rice. And we shared a short stack of guava chiffon pancakes with a side of coconut syrup.  If you like Hawaiian food, pancakes, breakfast, you need to check it out :)",

His bacon was over cooked so we had to ask them to re cook it for us. I think the pancakes was delicious and turned out well but they could work on their other breakfast dish. The omelette was ok to us. The food here will fill you up quick. Big portions. I would come back and try other dishes but I know they just recently opened so I guess improvements can take time.",

And the banana pancakes - look at the pic. 3 thin slices of banana on top of pancakes. Coffee is served in cappucino cups and they have no karafe for coffee, so the waitress will be coming back a lot for refills. I won't be coming back. There are other Hawaiian breakfast places you can go that are not stingy with there servings for the price you pay. And to top it off, the bill handed me was incorrect.",

They give you the option of mix and matching the different ones they have, so I tend to lean towards one crab cake benedict and one kalua pork benedict. This time I ordered \"Da Moe Moe Moco\" with brown rice. It was SO good!! Instead of the regular gravy that's used, the sauce comes from their beef stew (makes it extra meaty)! Very good! You could still taste the difference between the kalua flavors and beef stew flavors even though they were layered on top of one another. My friend ordered the corned beef hash. The flavor is very different then the typical corned beef hash. The flavor was a little sweeter, but what I loved most was that it WAS NOT super oily. On a side note, we also had the guava chiffon pancakes. I was never a guava lover, but these are something that I need to order every. single. time. The pancakes itself as deliciously moist and fluffy, but the sauce that's on top is like a light guava cream cheese taste. It's not overpowering with sweetness and it has a good tartness. There's a reason why it was voted one of Las Vegas's best pancakes!",

They were very kind and offered a sample of some of their pancakes and it only got ya more excited.   I enjoyed the Carsie Kalbi rib plate and I chose brown rice and over medium  eggs. Comfort food for me all day. My cousin however got like a kalbi loco moco and it looked pretty much the same except that she had a side of Mac salad and my ribs had cabbage underneath. Very traditional in sauce and what you expect with kalbi ribs so safe choice.   Hubby had a special. It was their take on a chicken burrito. Size was a little smaller than a nice Mexican burrito. He said it was good but not memorable. Still enjoyed it but he will still with their classics next time.    Pancakes! So fluffy yes! Only thing is that they are not the kind of pancake that you can fold and neatly pick up with your fork. So expect to scoop. Guava was the best for me because I love fruity desserts. Surprisingly not too sweet. Second fav was pistachio. Third was red velvet. Nothing wrong with it but it's on the sweeter side of the three so a bite or two of that one was all I could do.   Like I mentioned great attentive staff. Super busy for breakfast. Lots to choose from!",

    "text": "Having just come back from Hawaii a few months ago, I was craving for Hawaiian pancakes and decided to go to this Las Vegas location.  You definitely get the island vibes here, nice warm smiles from the workers and simple Hawaiian decor indoor.  I ordered the loco moco and as a surprise they offered a free stack of their guava chiffon pancake.  **PROs:  definitely great for the pancakes, the portions are pretty big and filling.    **CONs:  the loco moco was not so flavorful, and a bit bland.  Same with the macaroni salad, a little on the bland side, and I am not much of a salty food eater. Even if you do add salt on the side, it was not flavorful as I hoped. Nothing comparable to Hawaii's loco moco.  I don't recommend it.   Nonetheless, I might come back some time to try their other pancake flavors!",

My only complaint is that they're only open til 3 & I'd love to be able to come here for dinner. (And I'd love to see what they'd do with dessert, lol)",

    "text": "I heard this place was famous for their guava chiffon pancakes. So I was pretty stoked to check it out since I was in town with some friends. Came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10am and I expected a long wait but we got seated within a few minutes. It's a very spacious restaurant. I took a glance at the menu and of course we were going to get the guava chiffon pancakes to share and I got a half order of the crabcake benedict and for my side I got the kimchi fried rice, which is an additional $2.  I can tell you that for sure the kimchi fried rice is not worth it. It's a very small single scoop of fried rice. I didn't taste any kimchi, it tasted like plain old spam fried rice. It ached me to see such a small portion. I don't know if it was because I got 1/2 portion but if I'm paying more for an upgraded side. Don't jip me! As for the crabcake, I thought it was a bit wet. Kind of mushy. I've had plenty of crabcakes from other establishments not in Vegas and I've never seen such a lack of crab meat and flavor. I definitely would not recommend this dish.  As for the reason why we came to this place, the guava chiffon pancakes. I have to say, it is not worthy of being voted #8 in America as it claims to be on their menu. The buttermilk pancake was average at best and a bit dry. The guava syrup topping looks like medicine I use to take as a kid. It had a slight sweet tangy taste to it but honestly I've had much better pancakes. It's literally a little below average pancakes with pink sauce. I'm glad we only got the short stack instead of the full because we would have been more disappointed. Overall, this food experience was very lackluster.   Service: FANTASTIC, our waitress was very attentive and always checked up to make sure we were doing well or if we needed anything.",

My daughter ordered her buttermilk while my friend asked for her guava and I had red my velvet short stalk pancakes, they came with 2 large pancakes. Were soft moist and delicious that we couldn't even finish all.  For our main dish my friend ordered the teri loco moco (fried rice, kal- bi and 2 eggs on top covered with gravy) while I had my Hawaiian pork laulau omelette (pork, taro leaf and buttermilk fish) my first spoonful tasted like heaven. It was perfect, all of the ingredients and flavors blended in together for the perfect recipe. As I write this I'm actually thinking about going back again tomorrow. I want to try everything on their menu and I'm also heavily pregnant..  Our server was really good, friendly with the Aloha spirit. Food, service and cleanliness were all 10 stars.   So ono (good)!.",

    "text": "The food was fine. Not great, not special, but okay. Same for the coffee that I'd heard was \"wonderful Hawaiian coffee.\" It was ordinary.  There were 10 of us and they knew we were coming and had set the table for us. When I arrived, 4 of the ladies were already there, standing just inside the door. \"We can't sit down until we're all here,\" they said. Our table was right there -- the place was not full and they were obviously expecting us. After about 10 minutes of standing by the door, having to move every time someone came or went, asked again, \"could we sit down and at least look at the menu and have coffee?\" \"No. It's company policy. We seat you all at the same time so you are all served at the same time.\" Finally, they allowed us to sit down when 8 of us were there. Thanks.  The waitress was friendly, but it took a LONG time to get our food. When it came, 3 of us got our food, but after a minute it became obvious that the rest was not coming out. So much for the \"company policy\" of seating everyone at the same time so we would be served at the same time. By the time the last order came out, the first of us to be served were nearly finished. And two of the orders had to be sent back -- one of them TWICE -- because they were not right.   Two of our group had been there before and had told everyone how wonderful it was. Seems like something has changed.   When it came time to pay (we had asked for separate checks) the waitress took our cards and cash and was gone a long time -- another 8 to 10 minute wait. When she came back, she had all the credit card bills in one tray and all the cash on another tray separated by the receipts. It was a nightmare. \"Who had the half pulled pork benedict?\" \"That's mine. Oh wait, I didn't have coffee -- this isn't mine.\" It took us about 10 minutes to sort it out.  I have no idea what kind of tip the waitress got. It wasn't her fault that the kitchen had gotten 2 orders wrong, but the service was snail-slow and not customer-oriented. Maybe that's how they do it in Hawaii, but this is Las Vegas and there is lots of competition..   I really do hope they figure out where they've gone wrong and manage to get it right because I heard such good things about it when they first opened and was looking forward to something special. Didn't happen.",

Once seated our server took brought us two glasses or water and then took our food and drink orders.  My GF had the split decisions omelet with double bacon and cheese and for her side she chose the buttermilk pancakes and a Kona coffee.  I decided on the short stack of pistachio cream pancakes and a Kona coffee as well.  For starters the Kona blend coffee is heavenly.  I could drink a whole pot of that coffee it's so good!  My GF's omelet was huge and filled with plenty of bacon and cheese.  Her 2 buttermilk pancakes were also huge and very light and fluffy the way pancakes should be.  She enjoyed her meal but wasn't able to even come close to finishing it because the portions are just gigantic.  My pistachio cream pancakes were also very delicious and full of flavor.  If you're a fan of pistachios I would highly recommend trying these as they are really, really good.  Overall we will be returning to Cinammon's in the future.",

I remember that I had this place bookmarked for 10 months but didn't prioritize to visit. However, my siblings and I finally decided to give this place a go.  E Komo Mai(Welcome)! The Aloha spirit is truly what makes this place really standout. It's great to see another Hawaii transplant set up shop in the 9th island. Explains the location proximity to Trader's Joe, great for many Kama'aina needing to restock on goods after eating. Lol  Everything we had was on point. Especially the Loco Moco, the hamburger steak was on point with seasoning and wasn't dried out. Especially with the option to add mushrooms and onions. This particular dish is very hearty and would recommend to share with others. One of my sister order the Crab Egg Benedict and she was pleased with her order and my other sister got a build your own omelet. They were not greedy with the ingredients because I was able to taste everything. The seasoned country tots, was delicious and went well with the omelet and Benedict. However, the Star of our meal was the Guava Chiffon Pancakes. Fluffy, soft and moist and was paired well with the guava syrup. For those not accustom to Guava flavor, I reccomend to ask for light syrup or have the syrup on the side. Guava, is an aquired taste but its a common flavor in Hawaii. Will diffenitely come back for more Ono(delicious) dishes!  Special shoutout to our server, PONO. Mahalo, for the awesome service Brother! Truly feels like Ohana  (family)!  2017 Yelp Review #39",

    "text": "I had my eye on this place for a while. Decided to drop in for breakfast and was pretty satisfied with my meal. The restaurant has a comfortable ambiance to it. We ordered the crab cake benedict, kalua pig benedict, and guava chiffon pancakes. The crab cake had great flavor but was mostly filler. I preferred the kalua pig benedict between the two. The pancakes were regular pancakes but I enjoyed the sweet and tangy guava sauce. Service was pleasant and homey. Overall, an enjoyable experience. I'll be back!",

I did some price comparisons, and everything we ordered was cheaper here than on the Hawaii menu, as I would expect, plus there was no 3 hour wait like in Hawaii...of course you are in the desert and not a beautiful tropical paradise, so there are pros and cons.  Service was so friendly, and they didn't even look at me funny when I took my food outside for pictures, in fact they were excited!!   My husband for the short rib loco moco with boneless Korean style short rib, white rice, and a scoop of mac salad. The short rib was tender and perfectly seasoned.  I had a half order of Kalua pork Benedict with kimchi fried rice. I had this same Benedict in Hawaii, and honestly the pork was better here in Vegas!!! I was very happy with my choice.  I wanted the guava pancakes but once I saw they had pistachio, I knew that's what I had to have! We shared a short stack and they were delicious, super fluffy with a rich pistachio cream---onolicious!! Great place for brunch and get a taste of Aloha!",

Yum!!!  The pancakes were light, fluffy and had pistachio flavor. There were even bits of pistachio inside. The topping was nice but on the sweet side for my taste.   Kona coffee!!!!  Very good coffee so enjoy a cup or 3.   Skip the chain places and try Cinnamons out. I think you will be glad you did.",

It's a breakfast/lunch kind-of-place. Their menu items are NOT traditional so if your looking for more of an American menu...DON'T COME HERE.Anyways... I love the feel of family this place has. The hostess & waitress were so sweet and so spunky. They made this place...I love how our waitress was very patient & explained everything. She didn't rush us and gave us all the time in the world. The food....the pecan pancakes were AMAZING!! I can't remember everyone's items but everyone was excited to share their food to show how good it was. I had the veggie omelette. You can't get that wrong & they didn't.  The coffee was strong and very flavorful. The owner (I think) was very businesslike and had her crew on task. I didn't see the need for it because everyone was attentive unless she was training and that would explain her unfriendliness. Or I should say....She was VERY task-oriented but I think it's a positive since she got her point across. We ended up leaving our credit card there and when we realized that it was still in LV I called. Sure enough they had it & said they would hold it for us. Unfortunately, we won't be back until March so I called back and asked them to cut it up. Funny thing is, I trust that they will and haven't given it another thought until now.  hmmm.   So in a nutshell: AMAZING food, friendly service, honest, great prices, clean establishment, non-traditional food. I think we will definitely be back.   I love finding places like this one!",

The guava chiffon pancakes are gooey & delicious. The pistachio pancakes had an amazing flavor & where more cakelike than the more almost mochi textured guava pancakes.   The savory portions were just as good. I love that the kalbi is boneless, so you get more meat. I got white rice with mine, which I wish the portion size was better. For the amount of meat & eggs I think they could easily do 2 scoops of rice. The Hawaiian omelet was so good, I'll definitely get it again!",

There are not an overwhelming amount of options which can be good, however if you are particular about your omelette be warned. I wanted to order the Hawaiian omelette which included butterfish, and I requested not butterfish. The waitress said she can't do that and everything is premade.   The waitress was not very pleasant or helpful. She did not offer alternatives and just said no sorry we don't have this or that. She did not check on us while we were eating. My family was in need of napkins and an extra fork and she was not available to make such requests.   The manager came out to see how we were doing. The restaurant has been opened for 7 months. We did tell him the food was good but he came too early to answer how service was.   On a positive note, the pancakes were amazing. My family tried the buttermilk, guava and red velvet.   I am very sad though I will not be returning to this restaurant again.",

I will say there were a few issues; namely, our table had pancakes for a full five minutes before any of our other food was brought out. This makes sense when the place is packed, but there were only two other customers, and they already had their meals.  The buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips were good, though all of the chocolate seemed to sink to the center - had to dig before I found much chocolate.   Of the two omelettes at our table, one was of questionable doneness, so if that worries you then perhaps go for the pancakes or one of the other famous dishes like loco moco.",

Natalia was our server and she was very friendly, helpful, and kind.  My family and I ordered sausage, bacon, and Portuguese sausage. Along with banana pancakes, pistachio pancakes, and the red velvet pancakes. The only item that stood out that is worth recommending is the Portuguese sausage. Banana pancakes were good, but would have even better if there were more banana slices on top; however this could easily be done by requesting it. I did not care for the pistachio pancakes as the icing on them was just too much and tasted artificial.  I would return and recommend this establishment. They have some pretty unique menu options, so next time I would like to give a signature dish a try. Aloha!",

Honestly, the wait time wasn't too bad we were seated promptly after 15 minutes of waiting. The waitress was friendly and let us know what her recommendations were.  I ended up getting the kal-bi short rib loco moco. I've actually never had a loco moco before either. It's actually egg and meat on top of rice. I did enjoy the taste of the ribs and it was really juicy. The only thing I noticed was that the rice was really soggy. The macaroni salad was really delicious as well, they added olives which was really interesting in my opinion. I had more than enough for round two to go.   My girlfriend ordered the crab cakes. I got the chance to try that and it was really salty. I felt like we didn't order what we were supposed to order. It seemed like on all the reviews everyone really enjoyed their meals. I'll have to stick to the recommendations next time! I forgot to mention that they had an amazing cinnamon roll!!   Other than that, I'm open to coming back and giving it another shot. Service here was friendly though. Funny thing is that they put your receipt in spam container!",

    "text": "This breakfast spot is so reminiscent of a Hawaiian style breakfast, rightfully so with the original locations being in Hawaii! A lot of our friends have been here and are repeat guests so we thought we would give it a try and it was the best decision we made to start our morning!   After glancing at the menu, it's hard to pick just one thing! I love that the entire menu is island style inspired, it truly does make you feel like your at home (Hawaiian style that is). I went with the pork adobo kimchee fried rice omelette and my boyfriend had the kalua pig loco moco and of course, we had to try to famous guava chiffon pancakes!   Our waitress was incredibly nice and personable. She would periodically check in on us, to let us know our food was on the way, if we needed any extra condiments and would never leave us with an empty cup of water. The service is excellent and welcoming.   The food is EXTREMELY tasty. The omelette could have used a bit more rice, but I loved the amount of adobo they gave and it was so tender. The kalua loco moco was a unique spin! And the gravy tasted so good, like an authentic loco moco.   Lastly, the pancakes were truly to die for. You would think with the chiffon sauce it would be overwhelming but the pancakes were the perfect balance of sweet and filling. This amount of food was perfect for my boyfriend and I.   We will be back to bring our friends and family, it's hard to find a place like this in vegas that does breakfast and food like mom and dad do!",

I ordered the guava chiffon pancakes and the kalbi loco with Kim chee fried rice, mushroom and onions, and Mac salad. I didn't know whether to go with savory or sweet so I went with both. The guava chiffon pancakes were amaze balls!!!!! I loved it and they gave a decent amount of sauce and whipped cream. I finished every single piece, and really wanted to lick the plate lol. The kalbi loco was bomb as well! The kalbi was cooked perfectly, it wasn't rubbery and flavored so well! Went well with their Kim chee fried rice and the mushrooms and onions. This was so perfect, glad I decided on this place for brunch. They play local music as well and I love the vibe here. I'll definitely be back",

    "text": "I love going to Cinnamon's for breakfast, not only for their local breakfast but their pancakes!  I have the worse sweet tooth that I am always wanting some yummy pancakes and Cinnamon never disappoints when it comes to that departmemt. My all time favorite are the pistachio pancakes.  They're full of flavor so if you're a pistachio fan, you're not going to want to pass on the pistachio pancakes. The guava chiffon is light a mnd not too sweet but the flavor is all in the syrup vs. the cake itself. The red velvet tastes like cake but a bit too rich for me.  Besides their yummy pancakes, their other breakfast dishes aren't bad. I like the different benefits that they serve especially the kahlua pig. But my new favorite is the Hawaiian omelette which has both kahlua pig and lau lau (yum).   All in all, I would definitely recommend this place. However, just like other yelpers have stated, they are on the pricey side. My last visit here, I was surprised my bill was over $40 for my party of 3. So price wise, not a fan but the food and service...great!",

Food was delicious! I ordered Portuguese Sausage Omelette with mushrooms and the Guava Chiffon Pancakes. Yuuesssss those pancakes though? Let me just say it's hard for me to ever finish pancakes because it makes me so full so fast. But I didn't care how full I was I wanted to eat every single bite. It wasn't too sweet which I like, and they're HUGE! Can I get an AMEN FOR HUGE PANCAKES? No one smiles like a small child whenever someone serves you infant size pancakes right? Doesn't matter if we can't finish it all...we all can appreciate a big size. My mama got Kalib Loco Moco, which she enjoyed. Ordered Hubby the Kalua Pig Loco Moco to go, and let's say he was very happy when I came home with this! Seeing how they're both from Hawaii, they both said that they were very pleased.   Only con I would have to say is long wait time for the food.  Already planning to bring the rest of the family here soon!",

Loaded with lityle chunks of flavorful pork. Crabcakes were rich and buttery. They melted in my mouth. Not sure what makes them green, but they were delicious. My fiance had the kalbi over fried rice. Good size portion and tender pieces of garlicky meat.  They offer Hawaiian canned fruit drinks which were great. We ordered the pancake sampler which had mini pancake flavors of guava, red velvet, and pistachio. Must try this! Each pancake had a distinct flavor, was buttery, and had great crispy edges.

It's located next to several local businesses with a shared private parking lot.  I had brunch with a friend here. Neither of us had gone to Cinnamon's before. We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly. There was plenty of available seating on Sunday at 10:00 A.M. The restaurant decor was still Holiday themed, which was really nice.  The menu was consolidated. My friend ordered pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs. I had ordered the Hawaiian French Toast with a scoop of ice cream. Our order was served within five minutes of the order placement! I think this restaurant is one of the quickest services I have ever been to at a seat-down breakfast/brunch location! The food was delicious. I ended up putting the Ice Cream on-top of the French Toast (double sweet & delicious!)   The customer service is AWESOME here! We were always checked on and asked if we needed anything. I'll be coming back here again for breakfast!",

We had a taste of the pistachio pancakes which were so crispy. The banana pancakes with the coconut syrup were AMAZING. 10/10 will definitely breakfast here again.",

But we didn't even get our food until 45 minutes later and the restaurant was nowhere near half full. We can see that there were enough staff and even though they did not have enough staff they should have informed us of the long delay. Second the Kim chee fried rice we ordered came out cold. That is unacceptable! We also ordered the guava chiffon cake but it didn't taste like guava at all. Their food is not too special or too hard to cook so I would just stick with the other Hawaiian restaurants.",

We ordered two prime rib moco locos, one with brown rice & extra gravy. The other with white rice & extra gravy. Brody ordered the classic loco moco. 15-20 minutes was the time they gave us for it to be ready. Got there & was greeted with A welcoming Aloha. Paid for the order & said it wasn't ready yet. Ended up waiting another 20-30 mins until I got the order to take back to work which is a 10-15 minute drive. While I sat there waiting, I heard one of the women behind the counter mention to another person that an order was meant to be for take out. Once I got back & opened up the to go box we were disappointed with the two prime rib moco locos. Instead of the extra gravy, it came with a jus. We had to settle for it because no one was able to drive back. Overall the food was ok, the order was wrong & ended up waiting longer than expected.",

I didn't want them to remake it because of that one employee.  Now it didn't sit in the window at all and was served immediately so the issue was within the kitchen.  I will go back to re-review this restaurant cause of the staff and restaurant cleanliness and won't let one employee ruin a review.

The smokiness and flavor of what homemade Hawaiian kalua pig should taste like were all there--a flavor that's been hard to find among the Hawaiian restaurants I've tried in Vegas. I also tried the guava chiffon pancakes and highly recommend it. Just like the kalua, the flavors were exactly what you would expect and is perfect after having one of their savory entrees. Although, I do suggest ordering the sauce on the side so the pancakes won't be drenched in the tartness of it or be too soggy. Portions are very fair. The employees are very friendly. I will definitely be a returning customer.",

I understand this place is known for its savory entrees but im not able to indulge to all the savory stuff since I have gestational diabetes. But, my husband isn't diabetic so he definitely wanted to take part in the guava pancakes. I figured this is a breakfast spot.. they must have a veggie omelet or something simple I can have. Well, yes they did... but they were going to charge me over $15 dollars for a veggie omelet. The menu offers a \"decisions omelet\" which is the only thing I could work with. You choose out of the 3 meats and veggies that you want. Base price, $11.99. I realize that after choosing all the veggies and some bacon... they were going to charge me 1.50 for every item over 3 items. So when I picked my spinach onion and cheese, I had to pay an extra $5 to add a protein, bell peppers and tomato. Seriously? And the guy at the counter had the worst attitude. Did not want to work with me or provide any other options. And lastly the food was going to take 30 minutes to come out? I'd probably give it another shot after my baby comes out but no thanks. No healthy options yet.   Now I'm sitting at eggsoworks, paying 9.49 for alllllll the veggies and protein I want in it with no extra charge. My husband can still enjoy their yummy pancakes.",

First bite, I noticed the rice was hard. Either there was not enough water in the pot or this was how many days old rice. Half way through I noticed the rice was not even warm no longer. This experience was going downhill. I really want to like this place. Rice is comfort that plays a major part in a hot meal. Preparation errors could be costly, hopefully they can correct the issue.

Very professional manager on duty who came here to set this Sister operation...authenticity!!  The server immediately brings the coffee, custom blend for their establishment.

Liked the chewy bite to them), crab Benedict (husband really loved) and loco moco (homerun!) Reviews complained about the high prices but we thought it was reasonable for the portions and what you would pay to eat at a similar restaurant. Made me miss the island!",

Decided to give it another shot today and was super disappointed with the service. The French toast was undercooked with country crock butter on top, and they didn't bring our pancakes out until 20 minutes after the rest of our food.   Don't come here expecting the great service and food quality that the cinnamons in Hawaii has, which I grew up going to every Sunday of my childhood. Very disappointing!",

    "text": "My first review ever- On our Vegas visit this 'Presidents Day' weekend we decided to try this new place Cinammons.  Drove 25 mins from the M Casino to place our order. First thing the person at the register said ' take out is a 1 hr wait... really at 10:30 in the morning? No good Morning, Hi, Welcome???  So we ordered, and during our long wait observed the following.  Mad Freaking Chaos!!!!  There were 6 people behind the counter standing around, while the manager 'assume he was, since he wore green shirt' ran around the restaurant like a crazy, frazzled person' people kept asking for either, utensils, drinks, plates etc.  For a place where all tables were not filled- why the mad rush, he kept barking orders and everyone else on his staff were on island time, there were 2 people that swept the same floor in the space of 10 mins and it was not even dirty- yet no one bothered to check on the people dining to see if they needed anything.   He needs to delegate a whole lot better, or pick a different career in my humble opinion . His staff needed to kick it in gear and and service the people dining. I have never seen anything like this in my life.  We stood there for 15 mins past the 1 hr wait time, watching the kitchen and person packing our food argue about the order. I'm loss for words at this point, hopefully the food $85 worth,  will compensate for this horrible experience. Here's a concept: maybe someone should have extended a courtesy, sorry for the long wait, would you like some water while you wait?... I mean something- Worst Customer Service Ever!!! Wow!!!!",

I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon,  not really knowing what to expect. I walked in to a large open space that was moderately busy as it was after the typical breakfast rush.  I was given a brief overview of the service style,  specials and items that were sold out; it was done in a very welcoming manner.    The counter service will take some getting used to for me,  but the menu and service more than makes up for this issue of mine.     I came in specifically for the Guava Chiffon Pancakes,  and the crab-benny caught my eye,  so a 1/2 order of both were in store.  Both were delicious, even though I believe the Eggs Benedict is what will keep me coming back,  also why you should stop in yourself.   The pricing is on par for the portion size and overall a good value.  Service was solid and friendly and it was great to see the hands on pride of whom I believe to be the owner touching tables and leading by example.    All in all a solid little spot.  It gets 5 stars from me because for an operation that is less than two months old,  it is clear to me that they are doing something right.  I will be back.",

(Bad) my kids were hungry so that means nonstop whining of \"when are we getting our food and I'm so hungry\" which to all parents know is very annoying!! 4-food was actually good! My hubby and I got the the Kalbi loco moco, mine was a little fatty but flavor was good. My son got the red velvet pancakes and he didn't like them because he's use to Babystacks but I thought they were delicious! Very fluffy!  5- there is no kids menu so you will have to order from regular menu and pay more! I didn't like that since my kids don't eat much anyways and they both have different tastes so can't share their food.  I would go back, not anytime soon. Maybe when they figure out how to get the food out much faster.",

Service was pleasant and friendly. I ordered the Veggie Benedict, $9.75. This entree was spot on in every way except it was served COLD. This time around their Country Tots were available and I added a side of this to my entree to see what the Hawaiian version might be like. It was anticlimactic, they were just regular tater tots. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, I got that out of my system. My wife ordered the Hamburger Classic Loco Moco, $8.95. She had this over brown rice and added Mushrooms & Onions, $1.95. She enjoyed this entree. I had a daily special of Chili Loco Moco on my last visit and it was great. Being a mainlander this is a dish I was not familiar with. It's so simple, but so delicious. I highly recommend their Loco Mocos.",

There are two sections to this restaurant: One for express (take out/self serve) where you can simply order at the counter, and one for full service. My husband had the Kalbi (Boneless) & Eggs which he thoroughly enjoyed. I had the prime rib loco moco. I prefer my prime rib really red but the server said the best they could do was medium rare. Somehow it still came out overcooked but the demi gravy made up for that. Upgraded my rice to the Kim chee fried rice and that was pretty good too. Sorelle was our very friendly server. If not for the long wait for the food (about 20 minutes and we were one of two tables occupied) I would have given 5 stars.",

When you enter, you walk to the center register area and place your order.  You're given a card to place on a holder on your table.  When your food is ready, it's delivered to your table.  I ordered the guava chiffon pancakes with a coffee.  The coffee was brought almost as soon as I sat down and I was given a chip with the explanation that it was good for one refill.  I was told at the register that there was one refill on coffee.  There are a number of pancakes and Hawaiian dishes on the menu and the aloha spirit is evident in the decorations of the area.  This was the former home of Parma by Chef Marc and there are two good sized rooms.  In a short time, my short stack of guava chiffon cakes arrived.  Two cakes at a price of $7.75.  The coffee is $3.25 and I used my chip for a refill.  The guava chiffon is sweet and unless you like guava, I wouldn't recommend them to you.  The pancakes were fluffy and cooked just right.  You are given plastic ware and the food is served on a heavy paper plate with sloped sides.  I liked the cakes but I probably would choose something else another time.  Two friends showed up right after I started to eat and I really had my eye on the one person's order of a half portion of a benedict that looked quite good.  The staff was very friendly and one of the staff came around to check that everything was OK.",

The Guava Chiffon Pancakes are light and fluffy with a tart yet tangy guava sauce that's drizzled on top. I also ordered the Crab cake breakfast. They had really good flavor but unfortunately had more filler than crab for my preference.  Regardless the pancakes were so scrumptious and you cannot go wrong with spam and eggs. I also ordered their house coffee and it was a delicious blend in my opinion. No need for sugar or cream. But most importantly to recognize is the service. My waitress came to the table beaming a smile and had a loving caring personality that rolled onto her guests. I felt at home having breakfast in a new area. I will absolutely be visiting again.",

Everything was delicious, service was great and the food came out quickly while still being fresh.   I highly recommend the guava pancakes - the pancakes are so fluffy and the guava was the perfect amount of sweetness. they don't drench the pancakes in the syrup either which is good - there was the perfect amount!   As for the Benedict's, the eggs were perfectly made and though I preferred the crab ones as they were more flavorful, everyone else preferred the pork one but I thought it was a bit bland. The kimchi fried rice was good and also the tater tots were amazing !!   Overall, I'll definitely be back and will take friends here soon!",

My grandma ordered a lox bagel and I wish I had taken a picture because there were more onions and tomatoes than there was lox. We normally don't send food back, but she was very disappointed so she got the kalua Benedict instead. Kalua Benedict was alright, nothing amazing. My boyfriend ordered the loco moco prime rib. He ordered it medium rare & there was nothing rare about it when we got it. The Mac salad that came with it was bland which sucked because we love Hawaiian Mac salad. I ordered the signature sampler which is only served mon- fri & includes Cinnamon's famous guava pancakes. The pancakes were great! Although the red velvet wasn't fluffy and it just fell apart, I still enjoyed it. Service was friendly and very aloha, however the food just doesn't live up to the original Cinnamon's restaurant in Hawaii.",

Currently, you order at the counter, you can select from: eggs, meat, and starch (for the island guys, that includes rice!). An omelette, even have Hawaiian style, (kalua pig.) Pancakes, (guava chiffon), benedicts, and lastly loco moco's.   Today I had low carb, eggs and bacon (gave my rice to my husband. My husband had loco moco classic, (hamburger patty). He said the gravy needed a little salt. And we had the guava chiffon pancakes. They came smothered in guava syrup!   All very good, service friendly and attentive. Restaurant is spacious, open and clean. They stream Hawaiian radio, so it feels like \"home\". We'll be back!",

I had the pistachio cream pancakes and they were completely wonderful, and the portion size was amazing (and I only ordered the short stack!). My mom ordered their daily special of strawberry banana bread pudding French toast.  She loved it as much as I loved mine.  But, the hands down winner at our table was the coffee!  It is made from beans grown on the owner's farm in Kona.  So when they say private label, they mean it!    Prices were great and parking is plentiful, right in front of the restaurant.  The atmosphere is beachy casual, with the feeling you are right on the sand in Hawaii.",

The moment I walked in, I was greeted by the general manager, Marty, and our server, Matt, with the most heartfelt welcome. There is an exquisite art on the wall that I was absolutely drawn too. I love the rich, vivid colors on the canvas. The spaciousness and Hawaiian decor is impressive. Marty made time to share a cute story on how Cinnamon's got its name. This is a family-owned restaurant that began in Kailua, Hawaii and it was inspired by a little bear in a children's book. On my first visit, I tried the short stack Pistachio Cream Pancakes and also had a side of Kim Chee Fried Rice. The Kim Chee Fried Rice is good. But their Pistachio Cream Pancakes are so moist, flavorful and fluffy, you wouldn't even need syrup. I will definitely be coming back to try their Guava Chiffon Pancakes.",

So yum!!  When I heard one was on the Mainland, I'm soooo there!! It's on the corner of Buffalo and Washington in a small shopping center. It wasn't busy at all. Maybe because went during the week after the breakfast rush.  Ordered the Kalbi breakfast, kalbi, eggs and rice. The Kalbi was cooked to perfection and it match so well with the rice and eggs.   I was thinking of ordering the guava chiffon pancake until they told me they have pistachio creme pancakes. And they're only available in Vegas. Of course I had to try the Pistachio pancakes. They were so good. Sweet, so syrup was not needed. I have to say that I liked them better than the guava ones.  Stop by Cinnamons when in Vegas. About 15 minutes away from the strip.",

We walked in and there are 2 sides of the restaurant, on the right side, you can get the full wait staff service and the other is you order at counter, get your number, sit, and they bring you your food when ready.  We opted for the latter.  I ordered the half order of the crab cake Benedict with tater tots and we shared the grave pancake.  The half order is just one vs two.  Loved the tater tots, brings back childhood memory.  The crab cake was ok..it kinda fell apart too easily.  I wish it was cooked alittle longer.    The guava pancakes was sweet and yum.  The manager came over and told us that the pancakes has pieces of guava in it which was a nice touch.  The staff and manager were very very nice with that island hospitality.  Great experience here.  Not close to the strip, but worth the drive.",

When I was in Hawaii I tried the full order Benny with one kalua pork and one crab cake, also the side order of tots. I decided to get the same thing here! The kalua benedict was just as good as I remember it was in Hawaii, the crab cake Benny however was not. I couldn't really taste or see much of the crab. The tots were delicious and crunchy on the outside but perfectly cooked. We also ordered the Hawaiian omelette and even though we didn't like it, our server Matt was so awesome about letting us try something else. We got banana pancakes and they were nice and fluffy but didn't have enough banana in them, just a few slices inside and a couple on top. The ambience is super relaxing and all of the staff is very friendly! I would come back and try the kalbi ribs.",

I ordered the Kalbi Loco Moco with Kimchee Fried Rice, and boo ordered the Kalua Pig Loco Moco with Kim Chee Fried Rice. Our food came out fairly quick and looked delicious. The ribs were tender and the kimchee fried rice had the right amount of spice. The Kalua Pig Loco Moco was delicious as well. The pork was so tender and the right amount of saltyness was just to die for. This time we didn't get pancake which is all the rave.

We ordered fries as a side and the waitress came back telling us the frier was broken so we asked for a banana pancake substitute. (A fair thing to ask for when you can't get what you want) The waitress asked her manager and he said it would be a two dollar upcharge. I don't think I should have to pay for their frier not working but I digress. So we went with a side of white rice. A small portion to say the least and it was very dry. The kalua pig Benedict was truly the only good thing and it was done well. Other than that the place was clean the waitresses were kind, but the custom service was sub par as with most of the food ordered.",

    "text": "Every time I'm back in Vegas I have to stop in to Cinnamons! 2 of the highlight dishes I'd say are the kalua pig benedict with Kim chi fried rice and the guava chiffon pan cakes.  The prefect balance of salt and smoke infused in the pig, stacked on an English muffin. It was toasted crisp, yet still maintained its chew. A perfectly poached (not runny eww) egg on top. Then it's finished with a silky tangy hollandaise sauce. I am very picky when it comes to hollandaise sauce, and this one knocks it outta the park! Their signature dish of the guava chiffon pancakes are legendary! Pancakes with I'm guessing is guava puree mixed in. Griddled perfectly to get the fluffy inside and a few crisp edges! The \"syrup\" it's served with I'd classify more as a glaze. Good balance of sweet and tart. Insider tip. Go with at least 2 people. One order these pancakes, the other order savory. Then split!",

Decor definitely has the Hawaiian feeling.  Decided to try the full service.  We ordered Pistachio Cream Pancakes and the Loco Moco.  Big portions, and the food was very good.  They do not offer decaf coffee, which was disappointing.  Also, coffee is served in paper cups, and you only get one free refill.  Food is also served on paper plates, which for full service is a little unimpressive.    Service was just OK.  No one that works there looks as though they want to be there, and our server was not friendly and did not even crack a smile.  After we ate, we ordered some pancakes for take-out, and they took about 20 minutes.  Too long, and no apology for the delay.    The food was good, and might try again on the express side, but the one refill coffee and lack of decaf, as well as the mediocre service makes it just an OK place.",

We got the kalbi plate, prime rib loco moco, crab cakes, and guava chiffon pancakes (I recommend getting guava sauce on the side so you can dip it yourself). Also tried the coconut syrup. EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD. Prices are avg priced, not too bad. Luckily we were seated right away, however the food did take a while to get to our table. staff is super friendly. Overall a great place to go for some really good Hawaiian food. We don't ever go to that side of town but we're definitely willing to take the 27 min drive more than often to get some Cinnamon's.",

They have a spot in Hawaii that's been open for over 30 years and ventured to the mainland. I am glad they did. I dig it. They also have their own specialty brew coffee which I bought a bag of for $9.50. It's better than other premium Kona blends available on the mainland.",

Then this past weekend while we were making our weekly Trader Joe's run, I saw the Cinnamon's sign up on the corner of Washington & Buffalo and literally screamed with joy! I wanted breakfast then & there but it was 4 in the afternoon. It wasn't until this past Thursday were we able to drop by. The space is huge, and we were immediately greeted by smiling faces. I finally got my guava chiffon pancakes and my boyfriend got his fave -- the Hawaiian omelette. It was definitely worth the wait, and the pancakes are just like I remembered!

We told our servers who gave us a whopping 4 bucks off of the meal, finally got ahold of the manager who took care of the meal (which should have been done in the first place).  Wouldn't go back.",

Kalua pig Benedict - my husband had this with country tots. He said it was good, the tots were perfectly cooked and the bread/bun it came on was tasty but overall needed more flavour, probably wouldn't order again. 2. Decisions omelette with a side of Pistachio cream pancakes - I had this and it was great. A huge omelette and you choose three toppings to go in. I upgraded my side to a short stack of specialty pancakes and they were awesome pistachio pancakes with a pistachio cream sauce. They were a favourite on the table, everyone tried it! 3. Teri meatloaf loco moco and Guava chiffon pancakes - Our friends shared these and they said they were great. The meatloaf came over rice with two eggs cooked to order. The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with a guava sauce that was yogurt-y and sweet. It was good although I think the pistachio was better.  Overall, a yummy spot to try for brunch!!",

This place knows how to cook good Hawaiian food AMD the customer service is excellent and you feel like you're back home in Hawaii. I heard about this place because my boyfriend kept raving about this place that he had heard of from back in Hawaii. We learned that they opened a restaurant here in Las Vegas about 8 mths ago.  I had the kalbi with eggs and kimchee fried rice upgrade. The kalbi was done right. It exploded with flavor the way we like it and not the overly sweet way. The kimchee fried rice was decent. My boyfriend had the guava chiffon pancake and loved it. He also had the Portuguese sausage plate with eggs. The Portuguese sausage is the norm that you can find around here at local Asian specialty stores. It was good but I do have one brand that I only buy.  The staff is very welcoming and greet you with the friendly Aloha spirit. The ambiance reminds me of the tourist restaurants back home that play the familiar kanikapila type of music with some Ka'au Crater boys or some Keali'i Reichel. We got to chat with the manager as the server informed him that I was from Hawaii and he graciously came over to ask us how we enjoyed everything. we learned that the place does get busy from around 11 am so make sure you hit this place early if you don't want to wait. We're definitely gonna try the Kalua pig next time.",

The food here is gratifyingly rich. Sweet items such as the guava chiffon pancakes ( a must if you like speciality pancakes and have a sweet tooth) are tasty, syrupy goodness, even if a little too sweet for me. The savory items are equally enchanting, such as the loco moco (am I saying that right?) and the kahlua pig and other meat dishes. The coffee is pretty good, too. (Step aside, Starbucks). The only thing that others have complained of, which is legitimately an issue--though less of one than before--is the wait time. But I believe the restaurant has done a lot to remedy this problem. This most recent time I went, we waited only a short time, and the food came out in a reasonable time. The service staff is friendly and helpful, too.  On the weekends, there is live music, in the Hawaiian style, and also reggae! Really cool.  There is not always waiter service, so be aware of that.",

This dish is a loco moco of szechuan beef with a medley of bell peppers and mushroom swimming in a perfect amount of a heavenly sauce. A must is the Guava Chiffon pancakes. For the holiday season, they have a pumpkin spice pancake that is served with the most delighting pumpkin butter I have ever tried. When in Vegas, Cinnamon's is a must!!!

I already knew some of my items I wanted to order while here, but I always ask for their popular dishes I should try. We ordered the Kalbi ribs with scrambled, Suggested by our waitress: $18.99 Wasabi ribeye medium with soft scrambled, pistachio/guava chiffon/red velvet pancakes. The house gave us a cinnamon pancake to try. We also ordered a side of mac and a side of fried rice. I have never been to their Kailua original location, but this place is in Vegas situated in a very nice strip mall with a lot of popular stores and restaurants. Their recipe for success is evident. However, I grew up in HNL and I believe I have a knack for Hawaii local foods. This place has great presentation except for my overcooked ribeye( it was obviously overcooked, yet it passed by the cook and the waitress whom recommended it). I didn't feel the value for the tastes of Aloha. The food would serve well for non local Hawaii people.",

    "text": "Good breakfast joint that offers a similar taste of the original Cinnamon's in Oahu, but sadly falls a little short of the HI experience.  The Guava pancakes weren't really Guava pancakes like we had in Oahu.  It was just regular pancakes with Guava sauce.  The crab cake eggs Benedict were good, but the OG ones were so much better.  Overall still a solid taste of the island flavors, but not the same as the original joint.",

I was excited to see crab cakes as a side option, but they were burnt and it was more like stuffing with a touch of crab. I wouldn't order it again. For Portuguese sausage and eggs, you think the whole sausage is on the plate but it came with three short half sausage cuts instead.   $48 later we weren't happy but it wasn't too bad. I'm an islander so I expected large portions and really good food. It was small and just okay.",

Great atmosphere, loved the decor and the background music, the staff was just fantastic.  Problem was the food.  We went for breakfast.  Wife ordered pancakes, and I ordered scrambled eggs, home fries, and Portuguese sausage.    She got her pancakes several minutes before I got my meal, to the point where she was half done when I got mine.    Sadly, my breakfast ranged from, slightly warm to flat out cold.  Eggs cold, home fries some warm, rest cold, Portuguese sausage just a little bit warm.   With that kind of experience, not only will I not be back, I will warn others of my experience.  That is sad too, because that place has potential....  Doug",

The wait there is always absurd on Sundays but here, there was no wait.  The menu is super similar to the one in Hawaii's which we were all very excited about!  I ordered the Kalbi loco moco, my mom got the Kalua pig and cabbage loco moco, my dad got the Kalibi and eggs, and my kids got the spam and rice.  The portions are okay, I remember the one in Hawaii had a pretty large serving but here was just okay.  The pancakes however, were HUGE.  We got the guava chiffon and the pistachio which were the STARS of the show!  They were delicious and not too sweet!  The location is a bit far from where we live (henderson) but we are willing to drive and eat here again!",

Basically, everyone's food was lukewarm including the rice. Who ever is in charge of the kitchen needs to yell at the cook or the server. Either the cook is not paying attention to the timing of the food or the server is not doing their job. It wasn't that busy there, so there are no excuses. I tasted my roommate's Kalbi and it tasted like cold beef jerky. None of the food was that good and trust me...Everyone that I was with loves Hawaiian food and some are actually from Honolulu. I will never return, due to the horrible meal experience.",

The staff was friendly but the service was definitely slow. I think it took about 15-20 minutes before receiving our omelette and pancakes.   The food was good but not mind blowing. The omelette was kind of dry and the pancakes didn't taste that much different from regular pancakes. I was expecting something more since we ordered the pistachio pancakes.  I would say the food at Babystacks (similar Hawaiian style/concept) is much better compared to the food here.",

First time I was in a steak and eggs mood and boy the fresh wasabi is a nice touch - don't be scared, it's actually quite mild compared to the paste that you get with sushi . I've also tried the Kalua pork and the kalbi, which are both spot on flavorful!  Their hollandaise is a nice compliment with a good touch of citrus which I find most places miss.",

This is not your typical L&L Hawaiian or Aloha Kitchen joint. This place is legit, as it is based from Hawaii. From the food to the service, I enjoyed it all.  Upon arrival, my group was promptly greeted and seated. The restaurant's layout is very open and there is plenty of space and seating throughout. The decor is very simple, but the little words and messages they have set up are little reminders of home. :]  I have read a few reviews about the service of this place, but as for my group and I, the service we received was just fine. Our waiter's name was Pono, and he was very patient and attentive with us. He understands the meaning of the Ohana welcome and service. Even though we came here around the time they were pretty slow, I'm sure the service wouldn't have been any different.  As for the food, everything was 'Ono (delicious) :p So many Yelpers have mentioned the Guava Chiffon Pancakes and I couldn't agree more. The fluffiness and taste... BOMB. lol One of the best items on the menu and it's definitely a must-try. The Loco Moco was really good too. So 'Ono! As for the omelets, it's awesome you can create your own. You really can't go wrong with everything else they have to offer. If you love Hawaiian-style breakfast or just the island-flavored food in general, you'll enjoy this place. I will be back for more!",

It has a casual dining atmosphere with a typical tropical island appeal and an extensive breakfast/lunch menu that can be ordered anytime you're there.  In addition to many Hawaiian specialties, diners can order eggs benedicts, omelets, meat and eggs combo, pancakes (including their award-winning guava chiffon pancake  which was voted 8th best pancake in America) and French toast.    Its operating hours are from 8 AM to 3 pm and prices are reasonable considering the serving size you get. We had a menu sampling on our first visit and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The first item that we tried was the pork adobo and kimchi fried rice omelet with a macaroni salad side.  The pork adobo and kimchi rice filling complement each other perfectly.  The adobo has the correctly balanced combination of salt and sour and the kimchi was flavorful rather than spicy.  My only comment is that it could have used more kimchi rice and I would ask for extra next time.  The macaroni side is very common in Hawaiian and some Asian platters and completes the meal. The next meal we ordered was the Kahlua Pig and cabbage combo which was shredded roasted pork with cabbage. Nice balance between the smoked flavor and crisp flavor of the cabbage. The chicken katsu was pleasantly crunchy and went well with a red sweet sauce.  I enjoyed the chicken with and without the sauce. The next item we tried was the warm ginger chicken, with a cilantro-greens chimichurri on top.  The ginger flavor in the seasoning was very mild and not overpowering.  The sauce complemented the flavor of the chicken which was perfectly cooked and moist and one of the better dishes of the day. Of course, we couldn't resist tasting the pancakes including the guava chiffon. It was beautifully presented with whipped cream on top and lived up to the billing.  I loved the levels of flavor in the guava sauces (tart and sharp) along with the buttermilk pancake.  As a pistachio lover, I cannot describe how happy I was to also try the pistachio cream pancake - with the pistachio cream topping. It was fluffy and green and so was the creamy pistachio topping and, as good as the guava was, I think that this one might even be better. And finally- we tried 2 sliders: a chicken barbeque with coleslaw slider; and the homemade beef patty with caramelized onions, spinach and aioli. The coleslaw went well with the barbeque flavor.  The hamburger came with a wedge of lemon to squeeze on the hamburger.  I felt like the lemon enhanced and completed the taste of the hamburger, but my companion was just as happy having the hamburger without the lemon.  All the dishes were very flavorful.    We also ordered two of the non-carbonated fruit juices cans from Hawaiian Sun: Lilikoi passion fruit blend, and a blend of passion fruit, guava and orange juice. Both juice drinks were very refreshing, but I recommend that you try the Lilikoi.  Though we didn't have coffee, my familiarity with Kona coffee makes me assume that their house blend coffee (with free refills) is something I would enjoy.  I look forward to getting my cup and refills on my next visit and, perhaps, trying their own custom Kona blend.  Cinnamon's is worth going for a really good gastronomic experience that will not break your budget and we will definitely be returning there soon.",

I got a hot chocolate (which was super yummy and they had added whipped cream and sprinkles) and babe just stuck with water.   Our server was super friendly and helpful. Babe ordered two (yes, I said it) TWO meals! He got the half crabcake benedict with extra crispy tots and the bonless kalbi loco moco with macaroni salad. I got the kalua pig/lox & cream cheese benedicts with some home fries. We shared everything and it was quite the delicious and fulfilling meal.   I'm so happy we came here because everything was so delightful. From the moment we entered to the moment we left, I was completely satisfied. If you're in the area definitely stop by and try some of their unique stuff!",

    "text": "CINNAMON'S!  Yes, I talked about them before.  But they have just added a lot of new items to their breakfast and lunch menu, so they deserve a new go round  Featuring many Hawaiian dishes, such as mahi mahi, kalua pork or smoked salmon egg dishes, crab cake benedict, and lox & cream cheese with salted salmon, this mixture of Hawaiian, Chinese, Italian and a little bit of love is what Cinnamon's is all about.   Newest items they have is a cheeseburger omelet w/country tots, a pork adobo & Kim Chee fried rice with a scoop of potato macaroni salad.   Another new item is a seasoned chicken with a Chinese style green-onion ginger topping.  And we all know they are famous for their pancakes, so the newest addition is a Cinnamon Roll Pancake.  Lunch's new items include a Bun & Burger Combo, with Huli-Huli chicken alongside pina-cole-slada. That's slaw for short!  The Las Vegas Green Burger has fresh spinach, sauteed mushrooms, jack cheese, parmesan cheese & a garlic-cilantro aioli.  The chicken Katsu-Kalua Pig & Cabbage combo, has Japanese-style fried chicken w dipping sauce, and smoky roasted Hawaiian pork w/cabbage.  Taco, prime, or curried chicken and papaya salads, grilled cheese, or Rueben's are regular staples to name a few. Cinnamon's is known for its Prime Rib Loco Moco, an in house roasted with demi-gravy and horseradish cream.  This place is definitely Hawaiian, as they have 3 restaurants in Hawaii and 2 in Japan and are fast expanding this great new concept. Owner Alika Nam will go out of his way for whatever you request.  Take-out orders for sure.  Open 7 days, 8 a.m. 3.  Will cater.  7591 W. Washington.  702-478-7027.  And they sell the best Hawaiian coffee!",

Service was good, everything in a timely manner and staff was really friendly. We had loco moco, kahlua pork, red velvet pancakes and lau lau. Food was mediocre. We were also a little disappointed since our server charged us for mushrooms and onions on his loco moco, yet the way she offered it was, \"Are you okay with mushroom and onions?\" I think we all know the proper way to ask should've been, \"Would you like to add mushroom and onions for $2?\" instead.",

It's hard to come across a quality Hawaiian restaurant here in Las Vegas, but Cinnamon's definitely exceeded my expectations.   The music, decor and overall ambience of the place made me feel like I was back home in Hawaii. The staff was friendly and their menu definitely had some originality. I ordered the Brian's Phoenix Beef Loco Moco ($11.99), my boyfriend got the Carsie's Boneless Kal-bi Loco Moco ($12.25), and we shared a short stack (2) of the Guava Chiffon Pancakes ($6.99). Every single dish was delicious.   The Phoenix Beef had a nice outer crisp to it, but once you got past the crisp layer, it was soft and tender inside. Also, if you like spicy, I would recommend this dish as it is cooked to have a little kick to it. As for the Carsie's Boneless Kal-bi, the kalbi was soft and savory. My boyfriend also liked that the kalbi was boneless, making it easier to eat. Lastly, the Guava Chiffon Pancakes are some of the best pancakes I've had in a while. It wasn't too sweet or too bland, and they were thick and fluffy.     I can't forget to mention if you're going to order coffee and like the taste of coconut, ask for the creamer that has coconut in it. It is amazing! Huge shoutout to our server Alyssa for recommending that, and for being an amazing server during our entire dining experience. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, checked on us often and was always smiling.   I wish there was one closer to where I live. However, it is worth the drive and I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other dishes on the menu.",

Everything about this place reminds us of home. The food, service and atmosphere always makes us forget we're on the \"9th island\".  My favorite meal here is the crab Benedict. You can taste and see actual crab meat. The English toast has a nice crunch and texture. The hollandaise sauce is flavorful and compliments the crab just right. My second favorite meal is the teriyaki meatloaf. I love teriyaki hamburger meat, but their meatloaf version feels less fatty with full flavor. The fried onions give it a nice texture. My husbands favorite is the guava pancake. If we didn't live so far we would probably be here at least once a week. So far everything we've tried has been yummy!",

The server was slow to help us and not many customers.  I think that I had was a breakfast burrito wrap and it was so bland and dry.  My girlfriend, Stephanie got the strawberry and a pistachio and it did taste like both.  Between the two the pistachio was better.  It was just okay.  It can use vanilla, eggs to make it fluffy.

    "text": "This restaurant was recommended to my husband by his friends who live in HI. After talking with our waiter, we learned that this restaurant is originally from HI and this is their third location, but first on the mainland.   When you first walk in, it is nicely furnished. However, the restaurant is huge that they tried to make it look Hawaii-ish with the art and yet contemporary with the colored chalkboard menus. But because there is so much wall, it is a good try.    I do have to say, looking around while being seated, the restaurant looks very clean. Major plus.  So we sit and review the menu which isn't very long making it easier to decide, so you would think. They have the usual HI breakfast items, but I can make that home. So my husband and I decide we would share and not order so much food since we were going to the museum following brunch that we didn't want our food to spoil. So we decided on the lau lau omelet and coconut french toast. My husband also ordered a side of the kim chee fried rice, because it isn't my favorite. So glad that we shared because it was a lot of food.  I do have to say that I moved from HI in 2001. One of the things that impresses me about HI is the fusion of foods or something so creative. Each time I go home to HI, I try something new. And Cinnamon's lau lau omelet is a major favorite of mines.   French toast also yum. Before I forget, it is Hawaiian sweet bread french toast, so we had to order it. And the coconut syrup, not overly sweet. But good enough that my husband actually poured some into his coffee.  Service, EXCELLENT! Our server was very helpful. I didn't realize that Cinnamon was open for only 8-months!  Next time my CA family is in town, forget going to Cracker Barrel, we're bringing them to Cinnamon's.  So great food, great service, clean restaurant - 5 stars for this place.",

    "text": "We ordered the sweet bread french toast and even though the toast itself is just ok, ask for the COCONUT syrup since they usually just bring out the plain ole maple syrup. Trust me, it'll change the taste of all future pancakes, waffles, or french toast you'll ever have.  I wish they discounted their half order of benedicts if you ordered two different kinds since its' about $11-$12 for a full order, which is two, or $7-$9 for a half order. I also wish they let you do half orders of the sides, but they don't. But that's ok, because this place was so good I'll most likely be back to try everything else on the menu.  I ordered the crab cake benedict with tots and these were the best tater tots I've ever had. I also tried the kalbi and garlic cilantro sauce for their salad. God, why is everything so good here?! I could eat salad like this for days if it came with the heavenly garlic cilantro dressing.",

    "text": "Eh....where stay da kama'aina rates??  Some pricey, you buggahs!  Of course coming to Cinnamon's on a Saturday morning is a tricky proposition, the place was crazy!  Locals everywhere!  That's what we get for the 1st Cinnamon's ever in Las Vegas!  Waiting time wasn't bad but there was a small line, took about 15 minutes for us to get a table.  After that things didn't take very long.  For breakfast we ordered:  *Red Velvet Pancakes ($7.25!) - short stack of 2 (yah TWO) world famous pancakes with vanilla-white chocolate sauce & powdered sugar  *Portuguese Sausage ($8.95) - 3 small pieces (!) of Portuguese Sausage with 2 eggs and an upgrade to fried rice ($2!)  *Hamburger Classic Loco Moco ($9.50) - home made hamburger patty with gravy and 2 eggs with an upgrade to fried rice (another $2!)  Man, what is with these ridiculous prices?  Honestly, Denny's right down the street would give us much better value!  With probably better servings too!  I gotta say folks...we were still hungry, we ate again after an hour!  So little food for the amount we pay!  Come on...you are a Hawaii institution!  You should know we local people are BIG @$$ people!  We come hangry!  Really, how long did you guys think 3 pieces of Portuguese sausage was going to keep me full?  With a tiny scoop of fried rice?  That short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes was kinda teeny too...my kid was eating off of my plate after she dusted them off, and she's a small eater!  I was expecting a Loco Moco of epic proportions too, fell short!  You sure you put enough rice & gravy with this buggah?  Some poho dis kine!  Cinnamon's, what is with these strange disposable wooden plates?  Not really feeling them.  Please use real dishes!    Thankfully our server was quick & pleasant.  She is from Maui like I am so we got along just fine.  Even she was like, \"Did you want to order something else?  You big guy das why.\"  She knew I was still gonna be hungry!  Not a good sign.    Cost after tax & tip for food & drink came up to just over $40!  Whew!  You know for sure in Hawaii das nuts!  Please Cinnamon's, you guys either gotta up the portions, or lower the price!  I get it, you guys are wanted here in Las Vegas but wow, I wanna be a repeat visitor!  No can with how much moolah I spend!  Right now there are just too many options for breakfast in town.    #ahcomeoncinnamons",

    "text": "This is the place is  from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out ! The service here is so home like . The people here are so friendly and helpful . They give you suggestions and i usually keep it simple with my go to options but today i stepped out of my norm and went with the waiters advice and I was not disappointed!   I ordered the Hawaiian style sweet bread French toast I did the coconut syrup sauce I couldn't of picked a better combo & spam , sunny side up eggs and soft potatoes. The potatoes were so flavorful . I'm very picky when it comes to my spam I don't like it when the spam is overly crisp or hard these were just right . The eggs I'm usually disappointed everywhere because by the time I get them the their already kinda hard and cold but everything here was served from what it seemed to be right off the stove !   My niece ordered the hickory bacon which was delicious I think it lasted two seconds on her plate . This child is by far one of the pickiest people I know and she killed her plate . Her red velvet pancakes were so amazing !   We also order kalua pig eggs Benedict which were like heaven in your mouth . Flavorful and moist  .  Last but certainly NOT least the guava pancakes or should I say according to my niece \"clouds your your mouth\" were like something I've never had before . So I never really like pancakes I always get that dry need to be drowned in syrup vibe so i stray away but these .... AMAZING ! Nothing I've ever tried before !   I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place ! The waiters were so sweet they were attentive always checking on us . What I liked most was the vibe from this place I'm not sure if it was the owner but the gentleman who approached us during our meal just made us feel so at home! I love small places like this that just open and are so eager to give great service ! This place I predict will blow up soon and I honestly hope they don't loose that touch the feel at home vibe they give off ! If you haven't tried this place you have to go out of your way to stop by !",

A side order of bacon came extra crispy, as requested, with about 4 or 5 slices making up the order. The banana mac-nut bread took a while to come out. It didn't come out until we were done with out meal but made for a good afternoon snack with its prominent banana flavor and plenty of nuts throughout.",

It may have been that we got here at 1:30pm and they close at 3pm and we got the bottom of the rice... but still. Then to the pancakes. Our first impression, these are huge! Good thing we got the short stack instead of the full! The guava sauce was on point but unfortunately under all that yummy sauce was burnt pancakes. We barely finished 1/2 of the pancakes because it was so burnt. Hopefully, if we ever come back for a second time, the pancakes will be nice and fluffy.",

The servers were so friendly, and knew what to recommend. I had the pistachio pancakes, and my boyfriend had the guava pancakes. Both flavors were new to us, but we ended up really liking them. My boyfriend is super picky, and only likes certain places. Definitely would eat there again!",

    "text": "Well.. Las Vegas eater gave this a promising  write up and not sure it lived up to it. It may be cause they are only in the spot opening phase but probably won't be returning.   Guava pancakes- taste like box mix and definitely canned whipped cream. It wasn't bad but not sure what the hype is about.  Hawaiian sweet bread French toast - okay, nothing special.  Red velvet pancakes a la mode- dry, dry, dry! The ice cream was even dry if that's possible lol it looked like it had freezer burn or something cause you can see in the photos that it was flaky.  Hamburger loco moco - we broke our fork trying to cut into it lol over cooked and not a fan of gravy flavor. Didn't eat this at all. They were nice enough to refund this.  My kalbi was the only decent thing. And I actually enjoyed that.   However, as our table was close to register we could head they ran out of that for other tables after they took their orders. So they had to run around asking what the guests wanted after. They also ran out of fried rice and Benedict's were 86d. We also asked for water and they mentioned the filter wasn't set up yet so they only had bottled water. We already ordered sun drinks so just wanted some water to wash away the sweetness.  The staff is nice but it doesn't seem that anyone is fully trained or nobody is really in charge. The poor order takers would kept having to ask the kitchen if they had orders. I always want to see new places succeed but at my specific hour of dining there seemed to be a lot of issues.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the manager came by to check on us.",

All my friends know how much I hate Babystacks and I assumed this was something like there but I was wrong! I've had the guava chiffon and their fried rice and I keep coming back for more....like every other day lol. Also I guess since it's a soft open and they are still working out some stuff in the menu my friend tells me that the food is not quite there yet in tasting exactly like the originals?? But hey if it's still THIS good being not all there yet then I am excited to seeing it at the finished product! Staff was nice and friendly too.",

The kalbi loco moco was ok, meat was really fatty and barely edible/sauce was good, but dish overall was not nearly as good for loco moco like Island Flavor's here in town.  Not busy at all on a Saturday for a late breakfast early lunch with lots of seating available. Service was good and even took loco moco off bill.",

I do not know how things are at the Hawaii location, but from my experience at this one it was pretty good! There are a lot of breakfast places in Vegas that have original recipes such as babystacks and this place is isn't a bad choice if you're looking for something different. They don't have as much variety, but the menu options are good. I tried the guava pancakes and my girlfriend got the Hawaiian omelette. The guava pancakes were yummy and it wasn't too much of an overload on my taste buds as far as sweetness goes. I also ordered 2 orders of egg whites for my protein. The Hawaiian omelette wasn't too bad, but I wish we had soy sauce available. The laulau was strong in the omelette, so if you're not fan of that you won't like it. When you order the omelette you have a choice between white rice, brown rice, and fried rice.   The interior is really nice and very clean so far. Staff is friendly and unlike other diners you order up at the front.   What makes this a 4 star place for me is the pricing. They are a bit on the overpriced end as they charge around $11-$15 for a lot of their menu options and the sides can get pricey. Portions are okay, but you'll get way more at other places. If they can adjust their pricing to mainland prices it would make it a lot better.",

    "text": "Finally, an authentic slice of Hawaii breakfast in Vegas!   Cinnamon's breakfast options do not disappoint. Akin to and rivaling Babystack's, Cinnamon's unique pancake combinations offer a more poignant Hawaiian theme with flavors such as guava chiffon and pistachio cream.   I had the Kalua Pig signature Benedict. Wow! It was very tasty. My wife had the Kal-bi short-ribs and absolutely loved them. We shared the guava pancakes and asked for a side of the pistachio cream just to try. We both couldn't get enough of that pistachio flavor. The tangy guava sauce was darn good as well.   Two thumbs up for Cinnamon's. Definitely coming back.",

I was going to get the order delivered but the special of the day wasn't an option online, so I decided to call the order in instead... Bad decision. The customer service here is horrible... With the exception of one very nice older lady.",

    "text": "Love that there is a new breakfast/brunch place in summerlin to eat at. Love that this place has an Hawaiian influence. The atmosphere is good and they have an express section and a dining section. They offer many breakfast options, such as crab cake eggs Benedict, loco mocos, and amazing pancakes. The only bad thing, was the service was really slow. I don't know if was just when I was there or if it's like that every time, but it took a very long time for the food to come.   If it wasn't for the slow service it would have been 4 stars",

    "text": "First timer to the Vegas location.  I frequented the Kailua location while I was living in Hawaii and working on that side of the island.  It was a favorite so I was excited to see this location walking distance from my job here in Las Vegas.  Atmosphere was great.  We were welcomed right away and handed menus.  Pretty much same selection as Kailua.  We sat to wait for our food.  After a few minutes we were approached and told this area was only full service and we \"had to move to another table\" since we ordered at the counter.  I have never been so humiliated and embarrassed at a restaurant.  Had we not already paid we would have just left.  How incredibly rude!  Not to mention the only sign in this area was \"E komo Mai\" meaning welcome.  What a joke.  I sure wish someone would have told us or there had been a sign designing where to sit.    The wait for our food was 30+ minutes.  Not cool with 3 kids with us.  It was a Sunday morning but frankly not that busy.  Food was good: loco moco, blueberry pancakes, and salmon Benedict, but nothing spectacular.  The servers were friendly but we had to ask for silverware.     My advice is to go somewhere else.  There are other Hawaiian places that are better not to mention you won't be told to move tables at other establishments.",
