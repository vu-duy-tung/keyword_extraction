Our group ordered a bit of everything so we were able to sample a variety of the dishes. Again, the food tasted fine but the only thing I did not understand was why all the vegetables we ordered came out last, at least 45 minutes after we ordered. This was on a Friday night and it wasn't that busy. Anyways, be ready to eat elsewhere after leaving this place.",

A bonus is that the raw fish here also tastes fresh, which is sometimes rare for seafood restaurants. The service is decent here too. The ambiance is calming and gives a good representation of a Japanese restaurant.  The prices here are also fair compared with other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. I recommend here for every one who craves sushi when they come to Vegas.",

    "text": "WAY overrated.  I guess when a restaurant puts out a \"Review us on Yelp\" sign, you can expect the reviews to be skewed in the positive direction.  I think the mistake I made was forgetting that the word \"Sushi\" is not in this restaurant's name but the first category it is listed under on Yelp IS \"Sushi Bars\"  I had both Sushi and Izakaya.  First off, first place I've been in all my travels and hundreds of sushi bars that they actually don't have a Nigiri menu (only roll menu).  This should have been the first red flag.  Second red flag is they had a bar area like a sushi bar but no one was standing behind it making sushi.   The sushi was LAME.  Edible, but the pieces of fish were small, quality of fish was average, rice was mediocre and construction and presentation also mediocre.  The Izakaya was good but I've not eaten many places so I'm no expert.  Had mushrooms, pork belly and tuna belly.  Pork belly was so so, the other two were good.    Service was uneven.  I guess if you live in the area and like Izakaya, this is not a bad choice, but overall this place is unremarkable and the Sushi was very lackluster.  4 stars for Izakaya, 2 stars for sushi = 3 star average.",

    "text": "Following the decline of one of my favorite restaurants in town, I thought I would never smile again.  Izakaya Go has me smiling once more.  Every restaurant scene in any respectable city has to have a good selection of tapas joints (among other things of course). I am especially fond of the \"small plate\" joints as I tend to be a light eater, yet I love trying many items at once. Japanese tapas has always been on the top of my restaurant list because, well let's admit it, the Japanese just do food better than anyone.  We stopped in late night for a small snack before heading home. Of course as always, I ended up eating way more than I should have.   While I thoroughly enjoyed my Udon, the highlight of the evening was certainly the Ramen Burger. Using pork belly instead of ground beef was a simple stroke of genius, and the sauce was absolutely amazing. This just might be might favorite dish in all of Vegas.  Service was great (I think the owner was our server), but the place was a little slow. Which was too bad, I think more people need to hear about this place, I think it has a good chance of taking the place of that old favorite down the street that recently fell off its perch.  I definately recommend giving Izakaya Go a go.",

    "text": "This was a toss up between 3.5 and 4 stars. When we first got there, they didn't look all that busy, but they only had space at the bar. Because it was just two of us, that was fine. It took them a while to greet us, even though several people walked right by us, but that was fine.  We ordered a few types of yakitori, a chawanmushi, beef ponzu, and shrimp yaki udon. I will say that everything was good on flavor, 4.5 to 5 stars for taste. My only gripe was the yakitori with plum, which was clearly bottled plum paste that I use at home and on the hiyayako (tofu) they definitely used ginger paste instead of fresh grated ginger.   The reason why I was torn between 3.5 and 4 stars is because of the service. It was slow and the order the food came out in was so random. We got one of the yakitori then our main dishes then another yakitori. About 3/4 through the meal, we got our final yakitori. After we finished our meals, I inquired about the chawanmushi. It finally came out, 45 minutes after ordering, and wayyy after we had finished our meals. It was definitely delicious, but it was kind of sad to eat it at the end of the meal. We asked if we could get the free ice cream for checking in on Yelp. The waitress asked if we wanted green tea or vanilla. I ordered vanilla since my bf doesn't like green tea, but they brought us green tea anyway. I love green tea ice cream, so it was fine, but I felt bad for the bf. At least twice, two different people brought us things we didn't order and we had to tell them that wasn't ours.   Overall, it was a good meal at a reasonable price, but I think there are better izakaya type restaurants in the valley. When we left they were super busy and had a huge line.",

I ordered the sashimi bowl, mom my ordered the katsu dinner and we both had a side order of shrimp tempura. We got seated in a booth right away... Order was taken promptly... Everything seem like it was going great until my moms order came out and mines seemed to have a major lag... Not to sure why when I had a sashimi bowl which is faster to make then a combination plate. My mom was almost done with her dinner... Still no sashimi bowl. The owner seen I looked distressed and came to our table. I told him that I was upset about my food not coming out.... He apologized... And about 10 mins later my bowl and our tempura came out. Food was great. Only thing that upset me was the timing of my food coming out late. The owner Go was nice to send over takoyaki... Which I thought was very sweet of him. He came over to check on us and we ended up talking up about all things Japan. The takoyaki here taste just like takoyaki in Osaka. I will be back! Arigato Go! It was nice to meet you! I'll be back. I'm a fan! -miss yelp 2015 (Mariko) P.S. Check in on FB to get free ice cream! Oishii!!",

Yes, there were still some server who were not as friendly as other japanese restaurants, but it did not bother our dinner at all.  We had a little wait, but were seated as soon as a table was ready. The server came, and I really wanted to try their catch of the day sashimi, yet they only had one kind and aji-mackerel left. Not so sure if they are kept alive, but it didn't seem like it since they did not have a fish tank on display to show the activeness of fish. Another kind, the server explained it to be a tougher texture so we ended up ordering a regular 5 kinds sashimi. The halibut was really fresh, and so were the rest. The tuna could have better color but when I tasted, it was still very tasty and soft. We also got blue fin tuna carpaccio with cruncy garlic, yummy!!! It was really red and almost melted in my mouth. Tako wasabi was a generous portion. Shitake mushroom and tiger shrimp skewers were worth every penny, but Kyara definitely has better ton-toro skewers. We added the truffle butter corn, shio ramen and spicy salmon cut roll at the end. The truffle butter corn definitely should not include truffle in its name, since I couldnt find a bit sign of truffle in the dish, yet it was REALLY GOOD-YOU SHOULD GET THIS IF YOU LIKE CORN AND BUTTER.  Shio ramen was a half portion but was more than enough. Spicy salmon was a bit too spicy for me but t was bearable.   I would go back again and try their catch of the day. Good quality food, definitely a good joint to hang on the weekends.",

Decor: Small, quaint Japanese restaurant near Kuma Snow Cream and Starbucks. The place was nicely decorated and had a decent amount of seating. They even had a seating area in the middle where you could take off your shoes and sit on the floor to eat (with cushions of course).  Service: We were seated almost immediately after entering the door. Our server was very nice and always checked up on us, refilling our drinks, asking if the food was okay, giving us extra napkins, etc. I think he was the owner, too. I never had a problem with anything.  Food: My mom got the Grilled Saba dinner plate and she said that it was very delicious ($10.95). Overall, the food was excellent and so worth your money. I ordered the ramen burger ($8.75) and it was heaven on earth. The pork was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth, the grilled egg was a nice touch of flavor, and the grilled onions were perfect. Although a bit messy to eat (I had to use a fork and knife because my mouth was too small for me to just bite it), it was all worth it. Everything was perfect and I'm still salivating over it as I'm writing this review.  I'm so happy I finally got to try this place out. I can't wait until I get to return! I'm dying to try their sashimi!",

The Poke bowl needed some onions and different seaweed, but the shredded daikon and shiso was really appreciated.  The Salmon and Ikura bowl was awesome.  Since this was my first visit it will take me a while to narrow down my favorites.  The menu was so extensive that it was really hard to choose.  Service was really friendly.  The food came out really quick.   I tried to go there for lunch last month, but found they were only open for dinner.   I'll go back again for sure, but I'm usually in that area around lunch time rather than dinner.",

Employees were very nice and polite which is why I gave a two star rating instead of one.   The main reason why I wanted to give this place a one star was because the main dish I ordered was not worth its price. I had gotten an order of takoyaki (which was very delicious) and an order of the chicken karage dinner plate. For me it was not necessarily bad but it was not as good as I thought it would be. As for the quantity, I had only gotten 4 pieces of the chicken karage. I was disappointed that I had paid $12 (not including tax) for this. Even though it comes with a side salad, one scoop of potato salad, a small tofu side dish, rice and miso soup; it was not worth the price for me. I feel that if it came with 8-10 pieces of the chicken karage then I would be ok with this. For me the three items that hit it for me were the miso soup, the rice, and the takoyaki which is sad to say. (I have a picture that I took of the dinner plate but for some reason I cannot upload since I am using the app on my phone. Will update soon)  Probably will not be going back there.",

It reminded me of eating or hanging out at local bars along the beach in Hawaii and Guam.   It's a small venue with a window view into the kitchen. So if you want to see your food being made, sit at the bar. Although, it through me off that the guy cooking and plating the food didn't wear gloves but rather wipe off on a side towel everytime he touched food.   Service is great! The owner Go speaks English and Japanese, so I found it a bit entertaining to hear someone at the bar showoff their Japanese skills by speaking the language . Although Go means 5 in Japanese, it can mean other things too. Here I am thinking it's the 5th restaurant of its kind...like Thai Noodle house 1 2 3 4 and 5...  The food was amazing and will be back to try more. They also carry Junmai Sake which is one of the best Sake out there.   Tucked away behind Krung Siam, it's a bit difficult to find, so just find Krung Siam and it's on the back lot of the restaurant.",

First we walked in and saw only Japanese people in the restaurant. We are the only non Japanese in the place. After seeing that we initially thought this must be a great Japanese restaurant. We sat down and saw grilled squid on the table right next to us and they said it is really good especially when it's a bit burned. Lo and behold we ordered that and mentioned to be a bit burned. Came out and it's so delicious! We got the Omakase as well and its also delicious. However we ordered the uni pasta and we were surprised as it was not the same as the one we saw in the pictures. The pasta is so creamy and yes delicious so if you are on a diet this dish is not the choice. We just want to try it and taste what an uni pasta taste like.... it's  delicious. Try it.   We also got a free ice cream just by checking in Yelp! That's very nice nice! We ordered 2 bottles of sake! It was just the right sake taste we were looking for, not so fruity and sweet and yet not so dry as well. Just perfect! I will definitely come back again in this place!

Ummm no!!!! we've been waiting outside in the cold and he never called for my name. I guess you have to wait inside, packed with other people in order to hear your name. They dont care for people waiting outside! Not a good place if you're claustrophobic. Too bad, I will never ever go here and waste my time! I should call fire marshall next time because everyone is blocking the entryway.",

The waitress suggest to try with the Yuzu Kosho on the Sashimi and is way much better than the wasabi. It has lemon and spicy flavor, goes well with Sashimi. Strongly recommend to check it out if you have not done so. The happy hour starts at 10am to close.",

Uni sashimi~$23 for just about 5 large pieces. it was very fresh and sweet.   miso eggplant~ it was ok. Flavor got a little strong towards as I ate more and more.   blue fin toro cut roll~very yum! recommend this dish!!   i forgot what else lolll   I would come back when I visit vegas again!!!",

First off the staff at this location are incredible and provide excellent customer service.   Now on to what you really came to read about and that's the food. Izakaya Go is REAL Japanese food not AYCE sushi ran by non-Japanese workers. I recommend going during Happy Hour (10-close) not only are drink prices great but you can try a wide assortment of their normal menu items for a fraction of the cost.    Thank you Izakya Go for all that you do in food and in service !",

We got seated at the big table. We shared it with 3 other ppl, but my bf and I were on the other end so it wasn't too awkward.  So for the both of us, we ordered: 1 lamb chop 1 tiger shrimp 4 pork bellies 4 beef tongues Takoyaki Pork gyoza Ramen burger and fries  Half miso ramen with spicy on the side  LOL. I let my eyes order bc I was clearly full before finishing all this food.  The skewers were all wonderful! Priced between 2.50-4.95. For some reason, my first round of pork belly tasted better than my second, but it was still fatty & delicious! The beef tongue was my favorite, but it's always my favorite to order. I could've skipped the shrimp, and the lamb chop was very tender and juicy!  The takoyaki was amazing :) it came with their takoyaki sauce and I'm going to guess mayonnaise? But altogether probably one of the best I've had!  Their gyoza was good too! I've been on a gyoza kick lately so it really fulfilled my appetite. It came with 6, and if I wasn't with my bf, I would've eaten all 6 of them to myself.   The ramen burger is prolly a 3/5. It's messy, too soggy, not as flavored as I'd like. If I were to come back, I probably wouldn't get it again. The fries were good tho!  And the ramen itself was good. I had the spicy on the side, but I ended up adding it in after. It was good! Loved the actual noodles themselves. It came with the same toppings as with a regular ramen, just a smaller portion obviously. So I still had egg, pork, seaweed and bamboo which I highly appreciated for it only being 5 dollars.   All of that food for only 60 bucks!!  All in all, I'd be back bc I love Japanese tapas and their happy hour :) just skip the ramen burger.",

We had Buta kakuni (braised pork), hamachi kama (grilled yellow-tail collar), uni, ika, some yakitori, and a couple of other dishes that were all very authentic and truly outstanding.

I refuse to eat bad food.  I'd rather starve.  This is the place I'd go back to EVERY TIME I go to Vegas, FOR SURE.    We went to this place around 3 AM.  It's really odd, but I honestly thought a lot more places would be open on a Saturday morning at 3 AM in Vegas, but I was wrong.  This place closed it down at 4 AM so we barely made it.    What I love love love about this place:  1.  Freshest sashimi I've ever had.  In an inland state????  How is that possible?  Ok, I've never had sashimi in Taiwan when we went last time and I've never been to Japan.  I stand to change my mind when I actually do that.  2.  The best \"Happy Hour\" menu I've ever seen in any place.  Period.  And for whatever reason, at 3 AM, Happy Hour was still going on.  Fine by me and my big mouth!  3.  Exceptional service.  I felt we were very well taken care of even though this place was PACKED.  I can't wait to go back to this place.  Seriously.  I don't go to Vegas very often, but I for sure will be coming here the next time we stop by.",

On top of that customer service was so bad  They only had 1 menu for 4 people to share. When we asked for a new sushi roll to be made because it was literally falling apart before we picked it up they said \"no that's the way it is\". When I pointed out the ramen only had two scraps of pork the owner acted like a child. He was unprofessional saying we were causing the problem & asking what our jobs were?

We had my friend with us who never ventured past a California roll. He was willing to try something way outside the box and this place delivered with full stomachs and happy faces. As soon as you walk in you know and feel like this is the real deal. The loud conversations from other patrons will right away tell you that what they are eating and drinking has a positive impact in their mouths and they are enjoying each and every bite. This place is small so if you have a large group, be ready to wait. Smaller groups tend to he seated quicker.  I will try to remember all that we ordered: garlic lemon gizzards, pork belly, tuna belly, cow tongue, spider roll, dragon roll, Unagi roll, sashimi 5fish plate, and Uni. My favorite was the Uni but the rest comes in a close 2nd. Everything we ordered was made to perfection and there was nothing we could complain about. This restaurant made my friend a sushi fan and more than ever willing to try more exotic dishes.   Next time We are back here we will definitely come back. But we will be ordering  different things on the menu. Only to explore other items that we anticipate will only gratify our pallets.",

It was super late so our only other option for Japanese would've been Sushi Samba, but we literally had that the night before so we gave this place a try. There was no wait when we came around 11pm, but we took the last table.  Ordered: x Spicy Tuna Roll - we usually don't order rolls, but lately we've been ordering spicy tuna rolls everywhere we go. This one was a little loose and lightly wrapped, but still flavorful and delicious. Helped that it was on the happy hour menu :) x Spicy Tuna Over Crispy Rice - I LOVEEEE crispy rice, but this one tasted more like fried. Super sticky rice in the middle. Still good, but won't order this again. x Sea Urchin Dumplings - It tastes exactly how you would imagine it. Eating warm uni was a little strange for me, but the boyfie thoroughly enjoyed it.  x Truffle Corn - SOOOOO GOOOD. There's actual pieces of truffle hidden around the corn. MUST order. x Whole Grilled Squid - I love grilled squid and this one did not disappoint.  x Albacore Handrolls - Probably my least favorite of the night. The albacore wasn't fresh and there was just SOOOO much rice. Usually hand rolls come with cucumbers or sauce or SOMETHING, but this one was just fish, rice, and seaweed. Meh. Maybe I'll get the spicy tuna next time.  The food is good and it's a pretty fun environment. Coming here for happy hour makes everything 100x better. Beers were only $3 and our check for all of that was only $50!!! We left stuffed too :) Usually when I eat Japanese tapas the check is ALWAYS over $100. So happy about this place. Even better because it's only 5 minutes away from where I stay.  Happy Hour everyday from 10pm - Close.",

It was pretty busy upon arriving and had to write our name on a waiting list.  We checked out their menu while waiting, and we were super excited to get a table and try out their eats.    We started off with the Hawaiian Tuna Belly Steak, Scallop yakitori, and 3 kind sashimi platter.   (We had salmon, yellowfin, and maguro on the sashimi platter--okay portioned.)   The tuna belly was BOMB and so were the scallops.  We also tried their Miso Ramen and Octopus balls.  The ramen was slurpin good. The octopus balls presented well with bonito flakes that waved and moved like the dish was alive, but they were so-so.  We also got the grilled whole squid and that was BOMB as well.    All in all, I shall be back here soon the next time I am in Vegas!",

I wouldn't say it's the freshest but i didn't feel the quality was a miss.   I just felt that the sushi slices were thinner than most places.  But at least the portion of the food was a decent size so you are getting a bigger bang for your buck.  You also can make reservation so you can avoid the wait.  This place does get packed so come early or you will have to wait.   The servers were nice and attentive.  They came back a couple of times to refill our tea and glass.    Don't order the chirashi bowl.  They don't give you much fish and the fish wasn't fresh.  My fiance ordered the udon and he loved it.   He finished even the soup.   lol...     I would come back here for the quantity and reasonable price of the food.",

Pork karaage also came out late. It was also dry and room temperature.  Service: Waitstaff was sweet but simply no where to be found.

The menu is pretty interesting and I am interested in going back later and trying one of their burgers. I wasn't in a burger mood this time so I tried a one of the combination platters with grilled salmon teriyaki. I can be a salmon snob so the first bite is everything. If I get the hint of fishiness it is going back. But, I was super happy to note that there was not a hint of fishiness. For 9.95 the Combo plates are massive and have a lot of food, could not even come close to eating it all. In the end it was very good. My coworker got the curry and enjoyed it. In order to get a five star review a place has to really wow me, and this place did not. But it was very good and we will return.",

(You might want to reconsider that friendship though.) wish I lived here so I can try more of their stuff.",

The izakaya go fried rice has that umami flavor going for it. Even the vegetables are good (garlic spinach and the eggplant with miso).",

With everything from spicy ramen to octopus carpaccio and everything else in between, the menu is very extensive and never dissapoints! Our go to is pretty much everything off the grill. The okra, mushrooms, scallops wrapped in bacon, pork cheek, beef tongue and korubuta sausage are just a few of our favorites and are always cooked to perfection.   Another plus, they are open late! However, they do get pretty busy, no matter the time of the day... so call in advance and make a reservation and head on in.",

It was pretty good but a bit salty. If you order this, make sure to eat it with rice.   2. Fresh Halibut Roll- So good! I ordered it with spicy tuna inside anyways of California roll. I would definitely get this again.   3. Tuna Belly & Unagi Yakitori: I saw good reviews on these so I ordered them, but they were just okay..I wouldn't have minded skipping these.  4. Sashimi Platter- Don't get this..it wasn't good.   5. Cold Soba- good and refreshing on a hot day!   6. Soft shell crab appetizer: Loooved this!   Overall, I think this place has such good reviews because of their pricing. I wouldn't say they have the best quality fish, but you're getting really good food for the price. Service was friendly, menu was diverse, and the food was tasty. Would recommend for anyone looking for good Japanese food in Vegas.",

It is busy even after midnight. The wait is around 15-20 minutes for bar seating. You put the name of your party on the wait list. The tables do not accommodate more than 4. Only one table for a big group. It's perfect for a light meal after clubbing.   The menu has more varieties than normal izakaya. If you are hungry, it can be pricey. It may run around $30 and more. Beer is not my beverage of choice but the Kirin draft served in a thick chilled glass is so smooth and refreshing. Come after 10 pm to get the happy hour deal.   Order: Tuna belly, pork cheek, chicken liver, unagi, Uno bowl, sweet shrimp, etc. The grilled foods contain a lovely yummy aroma. Super good.",

In this case, the answer is a resounding YES.  When the waitress brought over a stack of menus almost 10 inches high, I had my doubts. How could they possibly do a good job on so many different items. Pictures looked good so our party of three ordered grilled, raw, and from the kitchen items to try. Fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Raw items were fresh and briny. We also ordered the uni pasta, creamy with a hint of sweetness and sea. Overall everything was very good with maybe one or two out of 10 dishes we ordered were 'only' good. Service was also friendly and prompt. We never felt rushed even know there was already a long line on a Monday night at 7:00 PM. We will go back again before heading back to New York for sure.  Last but not least if you like to drink, there are a wide variety of Japanese whiskey and beer at very reasonable prices. BONUS.  Man I wish we had a place like this near me.",

    "text": "Best spot in town to bring friends and enjoy some drinks and good food! We always order the skewers and some of their sushi items- which is pretty fresh. We really enjoy their happy hour and appreciate how late they're open. This place actually reminds me of the some of the izakaya that I went to when I was in Japan- ambience wise. It's always busy, but service was always consistent and quick. I recommend making a reservation in advance.  My friends and I really enjoyed the skewers (we always just order a variety of different kinds to enjoy with beers). I think they're slightly overpriced for the amount you get & the meat quality isn't the greatest, but it's good beer food. We've had the uni bowl- it was Santa Barbara Uni that tasted pretty fresh, but really small. I also recommend trying the sweet soy dango for dessert as well. Honestly, we've ordered almost everything on their menu and enjoyed everything. If you're from Rowland Heights, CA and have previously dined at Honda-Ya, you will get a similar vibe. The only thing that I think needs some improvement would be service. We had a few servers that were really attentive, friendly, and accommodating (one specific male person whose name I didn't catch that always seats us for our reservations). However, the last time we were there, we had a female server who didn't really offer that friendly service and we had to keep flagging her down to order or get a drink refill. She just seemed like she was in a rush the entire time and we felt bad for taking up her time so the entire ordering experience just felt very rushed and unpleasant. I work in the hospitality industry and I think it's important to always speak clearly, be attentive, and maintain composure in a high volume or fast-paced environment, but speaking from experience, it is also understandable and we still had a great time. We plan on returning and will always bring friends/family whenever they come visit us from CA.",

    "text": "So two great thing about this place.  1. It seems reservations can be made but only during the weekday.  2. They have a great happy hour menu for food and beer  Service wise: great. The two young waitress/waiter was attentive even though every table was busy.  Food: surprisingly very tasty and a great place to try some Japanese style food. However don't get the seasoned French fries unless you get it at happy hour because the price is worth it. Their takoyaki was amazingly crunch on the outside but super soft and melt in your mouth texture. Curry udon was good but their ramen wasn't anything amazing but happy hour you can get a half size. Uni pasta is amazing! Super creamy and grabs the uni taste without over powering this.  Basically, all their foods are Japanese style tapas and meant to be shared! Definitely try this place out and there is a separate parking with tons of lots so that won't stress you out.",

    "text": "I found this place on Yelp recently when I was in Vegas with my boyfriend. After watching a show, we got hungry, well I wasnt hungry but he was and so I suggest that we should go to Izakaya and grab something light. This place had the best review and it was the closest.  I really liked how small this place was. Thats because if its too bug, it gets too loud and I cant even hear myself talking. That bothers me a lot. Like Hondaya in LA, I have to scream to talk to friends and I can barely hear what theyre saying so, who enjoys that right?  Their menu was very extensive like many other Izakayas. I know yakitori/skewers are people's favorite but we skipped all that and just ordered a few dishes that caught our attention. When I go to Izakaya, I always start with Takowasa. I dont know why but thats just my thing. I love raw food and so Takowasa is just raw octopus smothered in light wasabi. Its very good and you cant never go wrong with this!  Then we started ordering other dishes and one of them was Uni Chawanmushi. Its a very delicate egg dish. Its steamed egg eith some shitake mushroom tooped with uni. It was really soft and flavor was wonderful. Though I dont eat Shitake mushroom, its flavor wasnt too strong so I was able to eat them fine. But I let boyfriend eat the mushroom itself, haha.  Second dish we ordered was what, Zaru Soba? Haha, I love soba and I thought it was a better choice than Uni Pasta or other noodle dishes they had on the menu. It was a small portion but enough to share with the boyfriend. We ended up asking for another dipping sauce so it was easier for us to eat it on our own dipping bowl.  Boyfriend ordered the House Fried Rice. It was very good. It's one of those fried rice you cant really dislike. Just egg and scallion - - thats all you needed to have that great flavor. I really enjoyed it but I can make this home better, hehe.  I think thats all I had that night. We were pretty full from eating them because before the show, we pigged out at a buffet like crazy! It was good food with good ambiance. Price was just right and service was pretty good in general except when they brought out zaru soba, they gave us an empty dipping bowl. I told them it was empty and they couldnt believe it as if I was lying. Why would I lie about that?!   All in all, food was great and I would probably frequent this place if I lived here. Will come again with friends next time I visit Vegas!",

The owner is there every single time and that is so rare for restaurants now a days. We recommend doing sake bombs and order things you normally wouldn't. You will be surprised. We always try different things and always find something that is crazy good. Good thing is that if you don't like something than you lost a couple bucks. Big deal. We have been to other izakayas but this by far has the best service and consistently great food.",

There are just way too many good ones to name :(   I like their combo meals at the back of the menu if I want a full dinner/lunch that will definitely fill me up without the tapas. Their fried rice is delicious as well! I like to add hot sauce obviously to add more flavor!  ALSO, don't forget to check in to get free ice cream. Why would you want to miss that?!",

This place gets busy so I usually come right when they open. Otherwise, expect to wait - but it's very well worth it.   Izakaya go has a large menu, so if you're indecisive, ask your server for some suggestions. Also, the chef usually gives you complimentary dishes. Yesterday we got conch, and mantis crab - very different but very tasty.   Here's what I ordered:  Corn butter: delicious but I wish they melted some cheese on top  Dried Mullet Roe w/ Miso cream cheese: salty but goes well with beer Oyster shooter: great but if they added a quail egg, it would've been perfect  Baracuda sashimi - amazing and when you're done, they can deep fry the head for you.  Porkbelly skewers, chicken skewers and the beef tongue was my favorite. All delicious and perfectly grilled.  Potherb mustard yuzu salad with shrimp and avocado - dressed nicely and the shrimp is raw  Ramen Burger with Fries - MY FAVORITE ITEM. Instead of using a regular beef patty, it's chashu pork.   Service is excellent however when it gets busy, just please be patient. They're doing their best and I can definitely see that.",

The restaurant is located in a strip mall in China Town don't let that fool you. The decor is in line with casual Japanese restaurants on Tokyo.  The food. We ordered the Horse Mackerel $19.50. It's essentially sashimi. They slice the fish into site size pieces and use the bones and head to dress up the plate. When you are done with the dish they deep fry the bones and you can eat them. Very nice and crunchy.  Omakase Nigiri $65. We were serves 12 pieces in total. Everything seem to be freshly caught that afternoon (even though it wasn't) Tuna Belly (Toro) was flown in from Turkey (600lbs tuna). Super buttery. Sea Urchin (Uni) flown in from Santa Barbara. We were served proper size pieces not those wafer thin pieces you get at other places. Thus we were able to fully experience the subtle flavors. Sorry got to go now!!!!!",

    "text": "I can not wait to come back to this place - I want to sit here for hours and just keep ordering plates!   I had the fortune of coming here with a Japanese friend and everything she ordered was delicious. One of the dishes was so delicious I ordered a second one... miso glazed eggplant.   This place is best described as Japanese street food - or small plates/tappas.   The sushi was fresh and well done - not an absurd about of rice paired with it. The sashimi salad was on point in every way.   There were a couple of dishes I wouldn't rush to order again; their flavor just didn't compare to their other dishes. One of the dishes was chicken breast with plum, it just lacked flavor.",

Only 2 tables were filled and the almost all Japanese staff were replaced by no Japanese staff.  The food was still just as decent and definitely one of the better Japanese restaurants in the city, so no complaints there.  Sashimi of the night (25, 35, 45$ options) To eat between two people as a tapas plate (don't expect this to be that filling) the 25$ was perfect.  Karaage: skip it. Over fried, over burnt, no flavor. It was closer to KFC chicken then your traditional Japanese style karaage. 1/5 Takoyaki: The tako wasn't the best quality, but it was good. 4/5 Okonomiyaki: There aren't very many places you can order this at. It's like takoyaki batter, but pancake style and with different seafood/vegetables in it. I preferred to okonomiyaki to the takoyaki. It was also a way bigger portion for the price.  With beers being as cheap as 4-5$ on draft, it really felt like a Japanese izakaya.",

Ordered:  Pork cheeks- good! But ours felt slightly over cooked  Halibut roll- super fresh and delicious Spanish bluefin - very happy with  Hamachi - comes w/ jalapeno and tomato slices. The jalapeno on this were HOT Kimchi pork- really enjoyed but could have been more spicy Chicken skewer w/ plum sauce- cooked good- didn't love the plum sauce.   The menu has SO many options.

Some of my favorite items on the menu other than sashimi is the Beef Tataki, Rock Shrimp, Truffled Butter Corn, Sushi Burrito, Tuna Poke with Chips, Miso Marinated Salmon Bowl, Sauteed Mushrooms, Halibut Carpaccio, Salmon and Hamachi Kama, Salmon Carpaccio with Truffle oil, Toro and lastly the Wagyu Beef Sushi  !!!! They have a full bar and are open really late which is a huge bonus for night owls like me. The crowd is always fun and interject this place is a must try.",

After a while the fish liver hasn't come so we asked about the fish liver and she said we ordered beef liver.  I told her that we emphasized that we want the \"fish\" liver and she asked if I talked to her about that.  I was like my husband placed the order but I mentioned one more time after that I want fish.    Later she just said okay okay and I was gonna tell her that it's fine we can take another beef liver, she just seems so frustrated and ran away.

Ordered the Japanese pancake as well as the takoyaki balls and I feel like it under delivered as far as the sauce and slightly over cooking it went. Other than that; it is great to be able to order these authentic Japanese dishes here in Vegas. The ramen was actually not bad compared to the fully dedicated ramen joints. The spicy pork is more mild, but the flavor of the pork and broth was very tasty. The hot Japanese green tea is fantastic if you are in the mood for tea. I would avoid eating an onigiri here (as it is just rice wrapped in nori) but the salmon belly skewers were delicious, and cooked to perfection. The grilled corn had a nice flavor to it as well. Overall a great place with a very excellent, expansive menu which means many new things to try!   --Reserve a table or get there early as seating is very limited!!--",

Would not get it again but i guess im glad tired it. Good prices for sake and beer on happy hour. Only thing is that i felt like our server was mad at us from the moment we got in. I didnt feel welcome but maybe she was just having a bad night which i can understand. This restaurant is v small so i wouldn't suggest coming here with a large group. I would like to come here again but on a slower night and with just one friend.",

I didn't feel like having a heavy meal so we found this spot on Yelp.  I know that it's somewhere outside the strip.  The Uber driver took us here so I don't quite remember the exact location.    This restaurant is small with a bar area and some booths.  The service was ok but it's Vegas and people are not chipper all the time.  They have HH here.  The menu is pretty extensive from sushi, ramen noodles, udon, rice dishes, tapas and more.    We wanted something light so we opted for ramen.  The tonkotsu ramen was ok.  Not the best but it will do when you're hungry or hungover.  I tried the spicy miso ramen.  It was more tasty than the latter.  Again, it's a last resort.  I probably wouldn't choose this spot again for late night eats.  There are better options around the area!",

Scallop  -Pretty good.  Some crunchy outside and really have the scallop on the inside.  Lamb chop  -Super tender and fresh.  Chicken leg -I really like the sauce.  Tasted very smooth.  Egg mustard soup -Tastes like yolk that has not been cooked all the way.  Super tasty.   Beef tataki -Good smooth meat with a little kick with the flakes on top.   Tuna belly steak  -It was ok.  Has scaled skin at the bottom so make sure to cut the steak on top if one does not like the skin.  Grilled pork cheek -Salty with the green onions.  Very smooth and tasty.  Combination fried rice  -Really nice blend of rice with meats  Yakisoba  -Wet soba noodle dish. Not on a sizzling plate  Service I thought the customer service is very good.

So glad we picked Izakaya Go.  It was pretty packed, but thankfully we made a reservation and was seated immediately.  There were so many things we wanted to order, but with only the two of us, we had to control ourselves.  We love the idea of half portion ramen.  That's usually our dilemma... we wanted a bowl of ramen, but usually those are pretty big portions and you order one you are basically done for that meal.  So we opted for the half portion spicy tonkatsu, steamed clam in broth with sake, the takoyaki, uni over rice, a variety of skewers and a pitcher of beer to share.  Everything was delicious.  The service was fast and friendly, there is a wide variety of things to order, and the price is on point.  We walked out happy and stuffed.",

I no longer live in Vegas but was visiting and came in with a group of friends.   Lucky for us, we made it for their happy hour which is 10 til close.   We ordered almost everything off the happy hour menu and wow.  I remembered thinking that the price points were good but the happy hour is definitely something to come in for.   The highlights were the salmon belly ($6)and the  uni bowl ($10) and the curry rice (base $11ish). The uni bowl was so good that we had to order a second.  Our party of four left stuffed with a bill of about $100. A steal for what we had.    Thanks for a great night.",

I was not disappointed. It's truly amazing and the foods were authentic. So many selections that I forgot how much I ordered and had to eat in tears at the end cuz I over ordered. The staffs were friendly and place is cozy. Now that I'm writing this, I need to go back for another meal!",

I also love the fact that they had tako wasa. This place hits the spot when I have a craving for that. Otherwise... I have to give it up to Tajima in San Diego for the best tako wasa. Uni pasta was decent. Very filling! They give you good portions here. They have combo dinners that's always a good option if you want a bit of everything. They get pretty busy at night but if you're in a party of 2 the wait isn't that long at all. This place does accommodate large parties though so it's a good place to grab drinks with a group of friends. For the yakitori, I recommend getting beef tongue, bacon wrapped asparagus, and chicken heart! If you like foie gras you'll love chicken heart. Not sure if they have fatty chicken heart but for you foie gras lovers out there, get the fatty heart if they have it.",

We also ordered Yaki-soba but it was not cooked well either, the noodles kind of clumped together, not easily separated and we did not care for the sauce used.  Overall, not a bad place for food and drinks with an attentive wait staff.",

You'd be surprised how many of places like these aren't actually run by Japanese people, and those that are try to be way too fancy and high end and charge an outrageous amount for the fish. This place is reasonably priced, and the menu reminds me of the days in Osaka drinking and eating and having a grand ol time with my cousins. The menu goes from sashimi to ramen to yakitori, but whatever you choose it's good ol fashioned Japanese food the way it was supposed to be made.",

Got seated at exactly 8:03pm and didnt get greeted by the server for at least 5 minutes -_- (yup! we had to wait 5 minutes to get asked what we want to drink) So upon ordering, since the place is new, the server wasnt really knowledgeable of the menu ..  dont get me wrong, SHE WAS SUPER NICE.    So our food took SOOOO LONG. we got 4 dishes and waited 40 minutes for everything to get delivered, in addition to that, one of the order was wrong..  (they had 6 tables) & the only good thing was that she frequently checked on us. Although when it was time for the check, we had to ask like 3 times for her to bring it.    Dont order the sashimi bowl. Im suspecting that was what made our stomachs hurt. We love japanese cuisine and we could tell by the first bite that the fish were not fresh at all.. this place need some work. OVERALL: food - 3 stars Service - 3 stars WAIT TIME - zero starsss !!",

Only thing made me mad was when we asked for the bill, I checked it and I found 1 thing on the bill that I actually didn't order and they didn't bring it neither. If I didn't order but they brought it to me and I eat it, I will pay for it. But the pork cheek belly that was a mistakenly charged by the waitress. We told her about that, she tried to say what the food looked like and we ordered it. She even brought the food picture to try to refresh our mind. What a \"kind\" waitress! I think she think I am trying to lie on that $6.95 dish and take advantage from them. We even show the picture that she helped to take for us and all food dishes was on the table. She said that dish she brought to us before the picture. In the end she said \" it's okay. I will take it off for your guys\" which make me feel that she is okay to give us that dish for free. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!!! I won't lie for a dish that I never order and never eat. And I won't lie for a $6.95 dish. She never said any single word of sorry to us. My night was totally ruin by her attitude. I will miss the food but will never go back. I still think she owe me a sorry!",

Glad I know about it!!  LOVE Izakaya Go.  This place has everything your Asian palate desires and it's open until 2am.  They have amazing happy hour deals, but I ordered mainly off the regular menu, so it's pretty affordable regardless.  How affordable, well less than 60 bucks fed 3 hungry people and we ordered a lot!  Ambiance and decor is modern Japanese. We had a cool table that is like a Japanese tea house.  Staff was friendly and on point with customer service.  I had yakitori (chicken hearts 4; okra 2; asparagus 2; pork belly), sauteed gizzards with stir fry vegetables, curry rice with chicken cutlet, sushi, AND kim Chee soup (and ice cream).  Everything tasted really good too.  They have a huge menu of exotic dishes, I can't wait to come back and try more (Uni pasta, sushi burrito, and more).",

Ramen, udon, sushi, or yakitori? They've got it all, and at very reasonable prices. Food taste fresh and decor adds a nice authentic ambiance. Music doesn't seem to fit the style but it's good music (reggae). I was actually drawn to this spot because of their sea urchin pasta dish, and wow, it was bomb. Creamy with a hint of the uni in each bite and a hint of saltiness from the shiso leaves and white sauce. The Alfredo pasta was on point. Can't wait to come back the next time we're in Vegas. Lastly, staff was super courteous and friendly. Home run stop to eat at.",

It was so greasy.   So I was a little apprehensive of this one at first, but then I took a bite, and I lost my damn mind. At first in the photos I thought it was roast beef in it, so I was like \"IDK if that'll be good. That doesn't sound good...\"   Plot twist! It's pork. I wanna say pork belly. But it it was just so tender and ripped apart so easily in every bite.   The consistency of the ramen bun was perfect. Crispy on the outside for a nice crunch and then a perfect (not soggy) noodle on the inside.  I'd go back for this for sure, but also aiming to try that bomb looking uni pasta.",

I can imagine it being very crowded and hard to find parking during peak hours like lunch and dinner.   Also, there is not many seats, so waiting is inevitable. Lucky for us, we caught them on slow day during a weeknight and got seated right away.   Waitors running everywhere! its great that you can pull one of the waitors so that you can either order something, get more drinks, or simply asking a question.   Portions were pretty good being an Izakaya place. Becareful though because these dishes stacks up and before you know it, youre racking up a hefty bill.   Music was all over the place. From EDM to Hip Hop to Rock Classics! I didnt mind at all.   Simple guy like me, i really enjoyed the house salad. Simple cabbage and sesame ginger dressing. Great substitute for rice !!  Don't forget to check in on yelp and get your free ice cream !!   I recommend the uni pasta, soft shell crab, and of course the seasoned cabbage !!  Enjoy !",

Our fat asses ordered a slew of plates: albacore roll (all his), crunchy roll, rice porridge, chicken teriyaki combo, and a ramen burger. I'm not sure I've ever had such flavorful chicken teri in my life, but this was a bomb in my mouth. The sauce in the ramen burger tied in how flavorful the meat was--which was a pleasant surprise considering my expectations of the thing were low.   My only problem was one of our servers. He had a lack of energy when taking our orders and asking questions that it dented my experience. Never a fan of lazy service. The other servers were great and helpful so I s'pose it sort of made up for it. 4 stars to food. Definitely coming back when closer to happy hour.",

Our server Bee was very friendly and recommended so many great menu items.   We ordered:  Braised Pork Belly 10/5 STARS!  YES that's right 10/5 stars! This was out of this world AMAZING!  Tender, juicy, full of flavor pork belly. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT AND FALL IN LOVE!   Miso Ramen 5/5 stars Broth was delicious, pork (the same one above) was sooooo YUMMY! Noodles were tender.   -Spicy Friend Rice w/ Jidori Chicken 4/5 stars It was very spicy. Full of flavor but the spicy got me..lol  House Fried Rice 3/5  The pork pieces we so yummy and tender but the rice itself was kinda bland.   -Pork Gyoza 4/5 stars steamed and pan fried well. full of flavor but the dipping sauce could've been better.   Fresh Oysters 4/5 stars I personally do not eat seafood. My boyfriend said 4/5 stars, the oysters were very fresh but the vinegar sauce inside of the shell was very over-powering to the flavor.    Pork Belly (on skewer) 5/5 It was crispy, full of flavor, and tender.   Karaage Fried Chicken 4/5  Crispy, very flavorful but there was a lot of fatty parts. The dipping sauce was very good.",

    "text": "Food-wise, this is a fantastic izakaya. The menu is full of interesting things I have never tried before, from the shark cartilage and yam to the uni chawanmushi. Yes, they were out of many things even on a Monday (which is when everyone here seems to recommend coming for maximum freshness/availability), but there were so many things to chose as back-ups that there was really no disappointment at all (except maybe missing out on the uni dumplings - we'll be back for that!). Be ready to make substitutions!  The drink menu and presentation was somewhat lacking for an izakaya. They have a decent sake selection with many unique sweet options, but no shochu and a rather lackluster beer/wine selection. I think based on other reviews and info online they may have a decent Japanese whisky selection, but it's not well presented/curated on the menu, so unless you're sitting at the bar, I guess you have to ask for more detail.   Minus another star for atmosphere and parking situation. I know, it's Vegas, whatever, but the staff didn't need to encourage the creepy misogynistic bachelor party going on at the table next to us by taking shots with them and obliging their requests to show them their tattoos, etc. There are plenty of more appropriate places for that stuff in this town. And then parking: despite the location in a rather ugly strip mall with what looks like it should be plentiful parking, we had to drive around the lot a few times to find a space, even on a weekday. When we finally got a space, we saw that all the spaces were marked as \"80 minute\" parking. Seriously? In a strip mall?! Plan ahead and arrive early!",

We love going to Raku, but wanted to try something different so decided on Izakaya Go.  They have a cool homey hipster type vibe.  They have bar seating with alcohol bottles all lined up against the bar, and they even have one long table in the middle where you take off your shoes (True Japanese style!).  They have a very extensive menu so it was a bit overwhelming trying to decide what we were going to order, but we settled for the following:  Yakitori - Beef Tongue/Scallop/Asparagus With Bacon/Chicken Breast with Wasabi/Chicken Meat Ball - My favorite out of these were the scallops, the beef tongue and the meat balls.  Yamasen - Good but forgettable  Hamachi Kama - Fish was soft and delicious  Chawan Mushi - Light and yummy  Yakinasu - I'm not a huge fan of eggplant so I didn't particularly like this dish, but my friend enjoyed it.  Grilled Mochi with Cod Roe Cheese - Must get.  Never had any dish like this.  Sounds weird but it was quite addictive.  Squid Garlic Fried Rice - Really good.  Felt like it was slightly missing something but can't quite put my finger on it.  I feel like we had more food, but I can't seem to remember everything right now. Overall the food was delicious and better than most things on the strip.  All the food plus a small bottle of sake only came out to $95 before tip.",

It's a small restaurant so may not be good for really big groups. Will be back again when we visit Las Vegas next time...",

The chefs here really know their ingredients and were able to create incredible, flavorful dishes! The waitstaff were beyond attentive and can recommend dishes based on what you like, don't like, or are craving.  We ordered 6+ dishes and enjoyed every bite of them.  The chefs make everything to order so it may take 5min longer than at a fast food joint but take a swig of one of their many imported alcoholic beverages and enjoy the eclectic music they play on the speakers!   I highly recommend coming here and it seems like the locals do too.  We will definitely be coming back for more next time we're in Vegas!    And...the bathrooms were clean too!",

The food was also great. Everything was perfectly portioned, reasonably priced, and delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered Japanese curry with braised pork belly, salmon flake onigiri, spicy salmon cutroll, and tuna belly steak. Everything was so good. Between the two of us, there was a lot of food to keep us full and satisfied, all for $27 (happy hour prices)! I also tried a bite of my friend's okonomiyaki, and it was amazing! If you check in on Yelp, you get a free scoop of ice cream. I got the green tea ice cream and I loved it. It was probably the best green tea ice cream I've had in a long time. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. I will definitely be back in the future. Thanks Izakaya Go!",

    "text": "After seeing many delicious pictures and hearing great things about this place from my friends, a group of us decided to try it. When we entered, we were immediately greeted by one of the staff members and quickly gave us a table. I love the decor and the atmosphere of this place, a traditional feel as you might say. The restaurant is a little small so it packs up pretty quickly as well.   What we ordered :  My group of friends and I always have to order a hot sake after a long day. So we ordered the house hot sake. It was stronger than usual, but that's always good! Haha. Ended up ordering two large ones. We always say that hot sake is a warm hug to your body.   Spicy tuna crunch was really, really, really good. I'm a sucker for crispy rice with tuna. The spicy sauce on it enhanced the flavor a lot more. The tuna and crispy rice ratio, very good.   The chicken karaage with mayo sauce was pretty good. Boneless and crisp to perfection. Very good  with the mayo sauce and squeezed lemon on the chicken.   The oysters were full of flavor. The sauce they put on the oysters completely blended well together. Only thing I didn't like about it was the oysters were a little too small for the price we paid for.   Ahi poke rice bowl was ordered by one of my friends. The rice bowl was a decent size. It could definitely fill you up. A good amount of poke in the bowl as well. The poke was completely fresh. Definitely melts in your mouth. Also comes with a side of tasty miso soup!   Super go crunch burrito was AMAZING. Consisted of imitation crab, shrimp tempura, and a few greens with avocado wrapped in seaweed goodness.  The portion of this is no larger than a chipotle burrito, but bigger than Taco Bell burrito as the waitress described it which was True lol.   Ramen burger was good too. Wanted to try it because there are barely any places that serve ramen burgers. Another reason why I wanted to try this place out. It was VERY filling due to the ramen noodles on top of it. The meat was very juicy and tender, full of flavor. To top it all off, the over easy egg with it. Just the yolk dripping down the burger.. Yolkgasm for real! The ramen noodles also had some sort of flavor to it too. So delicious. It also comes with a side of seasoned fries.   My overall experience with this restaurant? Definitely one of my favorite spots. A lot of variety and choices to choose from their menu. The service was vey good. They were very patient and helpful with our food order since there were so many to choose from! Will DEFINITELY come back to this place to try a lot more! Thank you izakaya go staff for the wonderful first experience!",

    "text": "One of my best favorite place in Las Vegas.  A relaxed atmosphere, common Japanlike  mood, kind servers and the taste are nothing to be desired.   Today, we ate Karaage dinner plate, marinated miso salmon bowl, salmon handroll and cold sake.  Karaage, my first priority here is worth to be recommended.  The rest are good, too.  If you go there first time, be sure to get Japan fried rice. The taste is better with miso soup.  Actually, most served food here are great and through severs here, you can feel how kind Asian (esp. Japanese and Korean) are.   If you go there with 3 or more, you can make a reserve seat by calling and always many people love  Izakya Go like me.  Very recommendable ,,,,,",

    "text": "I've been going to Izakaya Go since July 2015. My co-workers introduced me to this restaurant and it's by far my favorite place at the moment. Their food is always delicious and on point. Service is impeccable, and the owner is very nice. I love the interior because it's really cultural and authentic. They play Hawaiian music as well which is nice and soothing.    SERVICE Mr. Go (the owner) is always working when I visit and he's very nice and funny. Also the other employees are very friendly and attentive of a customer's need. If you ask your server about an item on the menu, they are very knowledgable about the dishes offered.   FOOD I have tried multiple dishes here, and each one I have tried are delicious. My favorite combo right now is the ten zaru udon (cold udon w/ dipping sauce & side of tempura) and chawan mushi (egg custard w/vegetables). If I'm in the mood I'll order a beef tongue yakitori (skewers). Unfortunately I did not start reviewing earlier and I couldn't take pictures of all the items I have tried. So far I have ordered: Deep fried corn flake halibut with homemade tarter sauce, Manila calm with sesame chili oil, Corn crime croquette, Spicy stir fried pork kimchi w/ pouched jidori egg, Half curry soba chicken, Chicken zosui, Deep fried baby octopus, Salmon flake onigiri, Salmon onigiri, Spicy cod roe onigiri, Truffle edamame, Seasoned French fries, California poki roll, Sushi Burrito super go crunch, Miso marinated salmon bowl. I have enjoyed every single item I have ordered.   TIP If you check in on Facebook and Yelp (I think) you get a complimentary ice cream.   CONCLUSION I will for sure be visiting again. Good authentic Japanese food, amazing service and great atmosphere.",

And I've actually ordered that much is because the owner and waitress actually pushed me to try new stuff.  When the food is so consistent that you do not want to \"experiment\", we have all been to those restaurants.  This isn't one of those.    Actually, one little caution, ramen is ok, there are specialty shops in town if you are into ramen.  Then again, I don't have to tell you not to go to an izakaya and order ramen.  That's like going to a Pho place and order rice.  Go with their specialties, izakaya, grilled, fried little dishes.",

It was a good recommendation since we were able to get there around 12:00 am.  The place was pretty busy considering how late it was.  I was surprised to find a happy hour menu.  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  There was three of us and we only spent 50.00.  We got s special hamburger steak Japanese style.  It was beef and pork patty it was thick about an inch and very juicy.  It looked like a loco moco but the gravy was different it tasted like they put Worcester sauce in it not the brown gravy that you get in Hawaii. It was not served with rice just carrots and potatoes.  This is yummy yum yum!  The spicy tuna rolls were yummy yum it didn't look like tuna color more like salmon but it was delicious. We also got the poke California rolls.  Then we also got the curry with pork tonkatsu, this was yummy.    We got the fried tofu and it was not as crispy as I had before but the taste was sweet and savory.  They put a lot of seaweed shavings and it was what made it delicious.    We got the pork ramen with miso soup.  It was not too spicy as requests.  The noodles were pretty chewy.  The soup had a taste of sake or something like that.  I didn't like it as much since I don't like alcohol.   The service was pretty good and they turn the lights for if you are celebrating a birthday.  They play a happy birthday song.  Reminded me of days when we w.rook our kids to Farrell ice cream.",

    "text": "Izakaya is a type of what Japanese would call bar food. It's the type of stuff you would eat with beer or drinking in general with friends. But they have more than just your typical Japanese bar food. They have full on entrees and other foods you can go for, but that's not what the purpose of my visit was.   Depending on what you get, it can start to add up. I think our bill between two people was around $90 hahaha but we also got some of the more expensive stuff on the menu though.   We got a bunch of stuff off the yakitori menu.....like one of each at least if not two. They were all pretty good, nothing too special to note, just really get what you like. This is where the price starts to add up, it gets pretty expensive when each skewer is around $2-$3 and they're not filling on their own.   We also got the delicacy sashimi plate which consisted of sea squirt ovary, wasabi herring roe, and salmon kidney. We were told to eat it in that order. All I can say is the experience was interesting and I'd do it again. It's one of those things you should try at least once in your life.   You can usually tell how good a place is by their karaage. Theirs was decent at best, I didn't really expect much but most places offer ketchup with it and instead they offered mayonnaise. Just note that Japanese ketchup and mayonnaise are totally different in flavor from American ones.   Overall it was a good place. I'll definitely look forward to the next time I go and try other stuff off their menu.",

Since they are open so late, I always come here during their Happy Hour times which is 10pm-close (2am or 3am depending on the day). I always either order their half ramen shoyu or half curry udon with chicken. They are so delicious!! They also have another menu for skewers and I never miss the opportunity to order some beef tongue, it comes with a lemon to pour on your beef tongue and it's so good and chewy. Their California poki half roll is very delicious too, I occasionally order this when I'm craving some sushi.  When I'm not ordering from the Happy Hour menu, I either buy the tori udon or one of their combination dinner plates. The combinations are so fulfilling because it comes with so many dishes! My favorite side dish from the dinner plates is the cold tofu they provide.   The workers are super friendly and helpful but sometimes it takes a very long time for them to notice me calling for them and getting the check takes some time too.

Don't b fooled by the ratings..I called to 2 make reservation & they said since I was on my way I didn't need 2 since max wait time was 30 mins...waited an hour...ordered food & the waitress came back & said 2 out 3 items we ordered were not available...don't even think 2 order any chicken dishes since none are avail...just filled up my stomach w/beer & fried rice which I could have ordered at the Chinese restaurant next door for better taste & price!!!  Don't waste your money & time...I should know since I am asian..",

And there are two larger wooden seating areas in the middle of the restaurant, where you are able to take off your shoes to enjoy your meal. We ordered the assorted sashimi platter, the teriyaki dinner combo and the ramen burger. The ramen burger took a while to come out, but they did let us know before we ordered. BTW THE RAMEN BURGER IS BOMB. I ate it with my hands as if it was a \"burger\" lol because I wasn't sure how to eat it. As I was eating, the juices from the burger kept dripping down my arm. Nonetheless, it was DELISH. RAMEN BURGER 10/10 RECOMMEND. All in all, it was a nice experience eating at this restaurant. Would come again.",

You'd think with such an extensive menu food would be mediocre, as how can one do so many dishes well? Well they do! We selected several items which were so good-crispy pork belly-yum!, salmon Kama-moist , otoro sashimi with fresh wasabi, house fried rice, crispy rice spicy tuna w/avocado, fried soft shell shrimp-light and airy-all dishes were fresh, generous portion sizes, attractively presented.  It was a very busy Monday night but staff was super friendly and attentive which made the experience complete-we can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. A new favorite spot for us.",

Was kind of sad they ran out of Toro which is our fave, but got the aniko? Which didn't have fat but it was still really fresh & bomb. I can't remember to type out all the things we ordered but we ordered like 10 plates and they're tapa style so it was def more than enough for 2 people haha.   Will be back in July!!!",

The rainbow roll was very colorful but we were looking for an amazing taste pop.

We also had the chicken skewer, shitake skewer, poached egg, and bacon wrapped quail egg! Everything was amazingly delicious.  And also with a check in you get a free ice cream. Your choice of matcha or vanilla ( both are very tasty and refreshing!)  Shout out to Travis our waiter. He was very kind and helpful since it was mine and my boyfriends first time here. He was also very speedy and came to check on us and refill our waters without even asking!  Fell in love with place just after the first tapas! We can't wait to come back already and eat some more off of this tasty menu!",

    "text": "Great value! Coming from the Bay Area, we expected to pay $12-$14 for one bowl of ramen, but the ramen options don't exceed $9 here!   In fact, everything here is quite decently priced, especially for the great quality of the food.  We started off with drinks--my friend ordered a glass of draft Sapporo, and I ordered a two-shot chuhai cocktail...and mine was only $6!!  Next we decided to try an appetizer we've never had before, and the first of those on the list was the Yamasen. The server asked us if we were sure we wanted it, and at first we were a little insulted because we thought it was just because we are white.  Turns out that yamasen is...unique. If you've never had it before, it's basically shreds of yam and nori in this cold, salty, thick, mucous-y liquid. I don't know the technical terms, but if that doesn't sound appealing to you, do NOT order it. I could only have a few bites, but my friend liked it so she drank the rest.  My friend ordered the spicy shoyu ramen, and I ordered the miso ramen with less spice. All of their ramen options offer custom spice levels, so that's a bonus for both those who like it extra hot, and those who do not! The miso broth was rich and tasty, the egg was cooked the way I like, but I wish the noodles were thicker. Overall, a great bowl of ramen. My friend loved hers, too.  I hope I have the chance to come back here in the future, and if I do, I want to try the other items! Ramen is great, but I feel like we missed out on a lot of their signature items.",

After asking him why, his reply was simply, \"I dunno they were the highest rated Izakaya on Yelp in Vegas.\"  So it's great that Yelp was around and he did some homework. The reviews don't lie, Izakaya Go was pretty good for an Izakaya in Vegas. They have a wide assortment of dishes including deep fried goodies, Yakitori, steamed, grilled and raw. The drink selection is also pretty large. Don't be surprised if you take awhile to order or keep ordering things you just discovered on the menu. Go with the sushi and Yakitori morsels!",

Could be a one-off thing, so don't let that keep you from visiting at least once here.  The vibe is cool, a little bit more of an open space restaurant feeling than a tight-knit/loud Izakaya you would find overseas.   The food is great for bar food and the variety is awesome. Tried a lot of dishes, nothing were standout spectacular, but all of them tasted great. So thumbs up on that. I don't think you'll find anything you dislike here, so don't hesitate to pick out something. Will say that the sushi style dishes smelled a little less fresh than everything else, but that's about it.  The thing that's a little off-putting is the service. Took an hour or more to get seated, took 20 minutes before a server even talked to us. We had to yell out to servers for them to actually look at us when ordering and even then they all looked annoyed. They forgot at least half of our order and we would have to continuously ask them about where the food was for over another hour.   Your most attentive staff member is Travis, he was the only one that helped us the whole night. The rest of the staff looked visibly pissed off or they were too busy talking to their friends next door from other shops. I mean, we get it, it's work, but at least take our order?",

I absolutely love small plates because you get to try many different things on the menu without being fully committed to a full, big dish!   Pretty reasonable prices for items. Some dishes, I'll admit, are pretty pricey, buuuut that's what Happy Hour is for!  Dishes are cooked right, seasoned right, and freshness is there! I've tried a lot of things on the menu, some which have me coming back for more : *Ramen Burger with Seasoned Fries *Crispy Pork Belly *Kimchi Pork Belly with Poached Egg *Truffle Buttered Corn *Truffle Edamame *Chicken Potstickers *Go Crunch Sushi Burrito *Scallop *Chicken Karaage *Scallop Carpaccio *Shio Ramen (Half Order is the perfect size for me!) *Miso Eggplant *Yakisoba *Curry Soba *Asparagus Bacon Skewer *Grilled Zucchini Skewer *Pork Belly Skewer Desserts : *Yuzu Cheesecake *Green Tea Pancake Sandwich Drinks : *Echigo Beer - Japanese Rice Beer *Spiked Calpico *Ikezo - Jelly Sparkling Sake *Kikusui Junmai Ginjo - Cold Sake (best one I've had so far!) - $20 *Orion *Strawberry Nigori - Creamy Sake   Few of my favorites from the list above would be crispy pork belly, skewers, truffled corn, yakisoba, curry soba, and ramen burger.. AND all of the above for the drinks! :P  Service is always on point for us and the staff are always friendly and attentive! I've yet to try the items on their regular menu, which means I don't have plans on stopping to eat at this place. We seriously might even be there tonight! Lol :D",

Go is seriously one of those owners you just have to appreciate. He works hard as an owner and as a server, etc. I've been here so many times, its ridiculous why I haven't checked in every time on here. At one point I made it to go here every week. Hell, sometimes when I leave and they greet you \"goodbye\" I yell back \"I'll see you guys tomorrow!\" And to no surprise, I do come in again the next couple days. HAH! I've told many many people about this place and every single one who has tried Izakaya has loved it!    I have too many pictures from this place that I can't post everything just yet. As a tip though, study that menu! There is so much on there that its hard to choose.   So as far as the staff goes, they all work really hard. I love how they all interact and check up on you constantly. They do get busy from time to time to where its hard to get their attention, but it's really not too bad. Also, the ambiance is quite lovely. I love the feeling I get in there. It's so calm and everyone's in their own zone.   Now, on to the food!  Ok, they have amazing food.  I'm not going to get to all the things I've ordered, but none of them have let me down. I promise!   Things I've tried (Anything with *** next to it is what gets me coming back):  Sweet potato crochet*** Crispy Pork Belly*** Pork Fat Cheek*** Chicken Karaage Vegetarian Gyoza** Truffle Edamame  Pork Curry Takoyaki ** Tuna Belly*** Chicken Heart Skewers*** Beef tongue  Chicken wing skewer Rock Oyster**  Dried Fish Over Charcoal Salmon Onigiri*** Poke Burrito Mushroom Zosui Porridge Jalapeno Bomber House Fried Rice** Soft-shell Crab*** Fried Squid Legs*** Whole Grilled Squid Deep Fried chicken Soft Bones Salmon Bowl Miso Soup Enoki Butter*** Dorayaki (Green Tea Pancake with ice cream)** Ramen Sausage wrapped bacon Chicken Gizzard  Fried Tuna Belly Asparagus Bacon Pork Belly skewer Yakisoba with fish flakes Most of their handrolls/sushi   Etc etc etc...   Oh, and don't forget the drinks! They have all types too.  I suggest coming in from 10pm until close because that's when Happy Hour happens.  Also, check in to get that free scoop of ice cream!",

They give you a bowl with white rice on one side and then a pool of curry gravy on the other side. You have a choice of topping like katsu, teri chicken, pork belly and we always get the pork belly , sometimes double portion. The pairing is amazing- the curry gravy is perfect, smooth, a hint of sweetness and a touch of Spicy finish the sauce. Mix it with the rice, pork belly and the diced pickled radish and it's Christmas in my mouth!",

I went with a friend who normally does not like fried rice but he said that the cha-han (fried rice) was really good here.   Great ume-shu and cocktails here.

    "text": "Izakaya Go is a relatively small Japanese joint designed for a drinking crowd. With a variety of food types and sizes, just about everyone from the extremely hungry to those just wanting a beer and some sides can find what they need.  That being said, with such an extensive menu, everything is about average when it comes to quality and flavor, which should be expected given the size of the restaurant. Just from a structural point of view, a menu this size in complexity would struggle with a crowd that they serve. Don't get me wrong, I was reasonably happy with the food we received but wasn't blown away enough to signify a higher rating.   The drink menu is also quite extensive, so everyone you are with should be able to find something for them.   Granted, this place is quite busy and I expect that reservations should be made if you're hoping to get in without an extended wait. The staff is definitely friendly, although could be a bit short-handed sometimes with the few people covering the whole restaurant.   Bottom line, Izakaya Go is a good choice for those with groups of people with varying food desires or a group wanting to try a variety of Japanese style foods. Don't expect the best version of anything you've ever had, but I think few places can match this restaurant in terms of selection options for the size.",

The restaurant is a little small so I felt squished at our table. I felt claustrophobic. Lol   I think they have 2 different menus? One is the regular one & the other one is for specials, I believe. I ordered takoyaki and a poke bowl. My bf had the tuna belly steak with a side of rice. The takoyaki was delicious. This was my favorite dish of the night! The poke bowl came with miso soup. Miso soup was alright, nothing special. I didn't care for the poke bowl. It didn't really taste fresh & i couldn't finish the whole thing. I had a bite of the tuna belly steak and that was pretty good!   If you check in, you can redeem a free scoop of ice cream! You have two options: vanilla and green tea. I had the green tea and it was good! Service was also pretty good. Though I thought she gave us a glare when we wanted to retrieve our free scoops of ice cream lol. I'll probably come back for the takoyaki but never order the poke bowl again haha.",

It tasted extremely fishy, fresh sushi shouldn't taste fishy everyone knows that. The server said it's tuna so it will taste fishy, as if we have never had actual fresh and good fish before. The rainbow roll looked awful, avocado was brown and oxidized (see photo). I'm absolutely terrified we will get sick from the fishy taste. Avoid this place. Food looks nothing like the pictures. Service is bad. The good reviews are either fake or they have went down hill.",

Living in Hawaii, I tend to be cautious of eating fish when land-locked. Not wanting to use up all my winnings on one meal, we took to Yelp. And as always, Yelp was spot on with Izakaya Go. It's located in the Chinatown area, don't know about parking, it was pretty full for a week night,  but we ride-share when in Vegas.   The food, prices, and service were fantastic! They have an extensive menu, prices are good (compared to the Strip and Hawaii prices), and the entire staff is friendly. We got to say hi to the chef and thank him for the best meal we had in Vegas.   Every thing we tried was delicious and fresh.  Squid legs in garlic butter, Poke \"nachos\", sashimi, salmon and ikura roll, grilled chicken livers, gizzards, and hearts. And when you check in with Yelp you get free ice cream, green tea was our choice, it was perfect for the end of a perfect meal.   And I still had money left to gamble with!",

I can only urge you to peruse their \"Fresh from the Market\" menu and order one or two of the excellent sashimi dishes (our favorite was Breem) where the sashimi is served on the fish it came from. After you eat the sashimi they deep fry the remains of the fish, which makes for an excellent crunchy snack. Perfect for drinking black and tan (made from Asahi Black and Kirin or Sapporo)! Go for it! Much better than going to these overpriced buffets on the Strip watching sad people stuffing their faces with all-you-can-eat crap!",

The food was excellent.  We had the udon tempura soup, bacon asparagus, garlic spinach, miso soups, sashimi bowl, soft shelled crab tempura, buttery corn, grilled shrimp and cucumber rolls.  This was almost enough food for the five of us.",

Not too loud like most Izakaya resturants but just right.  The design of the resturant is very Japanese so for those who love Japanese culture will want to experience this.    The food here is amazing!  A couple friends and I almost ordered the entire menu.  Even though there are so many great choices on the menu I recommend the Tuna Belly.  It was just amazing.

Service was lacking in at tentativeness and timing, needed time to review the extensive menus and they stopped multiple times then but once we had had a chance or needed refills on beverages the waitresses were really hard to 'find'.   Our party of 4 in the end was satisfied and full from our variety of selections lots of yakatori options and a few set meals.  I will say that this is the first place in Vegas I have found/had Japanese potato salad and it was so awesome to see that small scoop on the set meal plate.  Thankfully a friend and my other half who ordered the sets let me indulge; missing small slices of ham and a bit more salt but it sent me to the Asian market to get some Kewpie mayo to make one of my favorites :) We will continue to search out our 3rd Japanese place since we've been here the last two have gone out of business, perhaps they should have had higher all be it reasonable prices like this place and they would still be round; but we wouldn't object to coming back at some point.",

We were greeted warmly by the workers and was allowed to choose our own table !   There is a wonderful and broad selection on their menu , wether you're craving burgers , noodles , rice etc and the portions are generous and well worth the price!     My favorites are the karaage and tempura that are nice and crispy , ginger pork which has a unique flavor  and esp the Salt Salmon combo which is grilled to perfection and boneless ! The entree is accompanied by a bowl of rice and chef chosen healthy side dishes which are delicious !    Definitely dying to try their ramen burger and crab cream croquette burger , which may not be for a while because I am forever addicted to their special combos which leave me ever so satisfied and not grotesquely bloated or sick when we finish.      The owner is very friendly and always checks up on you to see if everything is ok. Everything is EXCELLENT! He and the other workers even recognizes us as regulars x3",

    "text": "jfc this place is great and I accidentally came here half my April. \"What do you wanna eat?\" my friend asks. I usually replied with \"I dunno. Izakaya?\" What I love about this place is Go. He's the owner and he works hard as a server and an owner. I respect these types of places a lot and it's part of the reason why I keep coming. Obviously the food is great.  I get a lot of food here for $15 during happy hour. The quote \"can I get veggie dumplings, two avocado rolls, and two pumpkin croquettes?\" is etched into my brain since I've been saying it all month. This place is soooo good and is constantly good aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Service is great. Every server I have gotten is extremely polite and treats you like a guest in their home. Go's hair is heavenly too. His hair is so beautiful and it's the real reason why I keep coming. Yeah, that's right. Forget about the food and the service, just come over, pay for dinner during happy hour and admire Go's luscious hair (Im kidding, dummy. Although, Go's hair is pretty gosh dang amazing).  My bill that comes after my inspirational quote I said earlier that mentions 2 avocado rolls, 2 pumpkin croquettes, and veggie dumplings comes out to be $20 (with tip) during happy hour. Pretty cheap considering I leave dying from eating so much. Sure, I can easily stop eating or ordering so much so I can avoid those post I-almost-vomited-from-eating-so-much burps; but the food is so good when it's fresh.  I have tried other dishes in the past besides my usual. I only remember having the curry with cheese. It had acceptable taste and was a huge portion. Izakaya Go is an izakaya restaurant, so it's not like them having an okay curry really affects them. Them only having okay tasting non-Izakaya foods matters as much as okay tasting chicken fingers at Cheesecake Factory.  Tips: Don't you dare disrespect the servers or I'll cut you. Order izakaya dishes, its their best ones considering it's an izakaya restaurant. Come here after work or during late hours for happy hour (DUH. ITS AN IZAKAYA RESTAURANT, DOOF).  Pros: Nice staff, the owner is a server himself and is a leader rather than a boss, great food, amazing prices during happy hour, Go's hair (so dreamy).  Cons: Uuuuuuuuuuh?????????? their curry, a dish that isn't specialized here, is only okay???!!! ugh!! If I could rate 0 stars I would!!!!! grr only okay!!!!!!!!! I can't believe this non izakaya dish isn't as good as their izakaya dishes!!!! 0 stars!!!",

I also had a grilled tuna belly which was cooked to perfection and seasoned elegantly. My tummy left very happy.   The only reason why I hesitate to give a full 5-stars is the service left something to be desired. I asked my server what he would recommend to accompany the Uni dish, which he could hardly create an answer for. He just directed me to the specials board, which worked out fine. But I was hoping for a little more guidance on the very extensive menu. Maybe a starchy dish to complement the egg custard?   The other note on service was about 7-8 minutes after I had placed my order, I was looking around the restaurant (dining solo tonight) to soak in the authentic and homey decor. My server must have thought I was being impatient as he then warned me that the specific dishes I ordered do take a while to cook. I was not concerned about the time, but you think this warning would be better suited as I'm placing the order not 8 minutes after.  Regardless I definitely plan on coming back, with more people, to enjoy a better variety of the awesome menu.",

The only thing this place is different from popular izakayas in Japan is that you can't smoke cigarettes indoors(of course), everything else is top notch! I went with a couple friends and had a great time with tasty food and ice cold beers.  Now this is how a izakaya should be!",

The sushi rolls were good but they really specialize in Japanese dishes. If I lived in Vegas I would be here all the time.",

Stand-out dishes for me: clams in butter, chawan mushi, fried rice (omg just what I was craving!), kara age. Shoot even a plain California roll is great here! All skewers were good especially chicken meatball, pork belly, and items wrapped in bacon. Wasn't too happy with the goma ae (too sweet) and that some of the salads felt too sugary from the dressing.",

My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday around 1 am for a late dinner. It wasn't busy at all and there was only one server.   We ordered:   CRISPY PORK BELLY: honestly my favorite dish. It was crispy and chewy. I liked the salt that was sprinkled on it. It brought out the savory taste!  CHICKEN KARAGE: Felt undercooked and needed to be more crispy.  UNI POTSTICKERS: hmm I really wondered what I put in my mouth. I think there was only a smidge of uni at the top and the rest was weird mushy stuff.  HALIBUT AND ABALONE: okay seriously for $15 I expected a lot more. The halibut was seriously the size of my two fingers and the abalone was very tiny also. They just serve it with a side of ponzu. GO WINGS: were drenched in some salty teriyaki sauce. The breading was hard and I didn't like it at all.  UNI CHAWAN MUSHI: very savory! I love the seafood that was in there and how it's served to you in a small cute cup. BEEF TATAKI: very small portion. Only five small pieces. I did like the sauce and topping they pot with it. The meat was tender and chewy! SPICY MISO RAMEN: the noodles were very undercooked and came out warm. The broth was light and just okay.   The owner Go was nice enough to let us try his small clam dish.   Don't think I'll be return though unless it just take out of the Crispy Pork Belly.",

Definitely recommend making reservations if more than a party of 4. I recommend the udon shrimp tempura soup!",

    "text": "Izakaya Go was a huge let down.  I went for lunch the opening week and got the salmon teriyaki lunch.  It came with your standard miso soup, salad, rice, soft tofu, and creamy potato side dish.  The food itself was good and what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant, but the long wait killed it... not on it's own.  The long wait to order, to get tea, for the food to come out, and then needing to ask for a spoon for the miso soup.  I understand this was opening week and some kinks were probably being worked out so I decided I should come back during dinner to see the full tapas menu and give it another shot.   That day and the next they were doing 50% off the bill so the next day at dinner I recruited a friend to check out the tapas menu with me.  It was more of the same regarding service, despite having more than one server interact with us throughout the experience. This happened the previous day.  The other funny thing was the same primary server who tended to us at dinner was also the one who was taking care of me at lunch the previous day.  I understand when it's stupid busy and a lot of people are coming through, you can't remember everyone, but she didn't recognize me from the previous day even though she invited me back to check out this particular menu, and the place was never packed the both times I happened to be in.  The dinner menu is large and easy to get lost in, we got the chicken yakisoba which was great, the halibut roll, a couple other dishes that weren't memorable, my friend wanted the bacon asparagus dish, which had a hair in it.  We let the server know just so they could make the kitchen aware.  They apologized and offered us ice cream.  Overall the decor is very traditional and I can tell a lot of thought and care went into it.  The staff is friendly and I feel like they're trying but there has to be some disconnect between the front and back of the house.  The food was good but was coming out very slowly and sporadically, I think that's related to the previous statement. Oh and they have been picking the weirdest Pandora channels for music, it was mostly some super slow r&b and a couple Pandora ads. Some people might find it petty for me to mention it, but I noticed it and kind of found it entertaining.   I'm not sure if or when I'll try this place again because I feel like I got burned back to back, especially with the other reviews being so enthusiastic about this place.  Maybe I had bad luck both times?  I'll give it some time before taking another shot here, there are so many options explore in Chinatown alone, and all around Vegas.",

After sitting in the front still awaiting to be seated so we can even glance at the menu it took about 15 minutes before we started trying to make sure that the servers were aware we were there.   Finally we got seated. It probably took a server about 5/7 minutes before she asked what we would like to drink.   The food did not take long to serve but the quality was a disgrace. I felt like I was eating salt. Like someone though it would be funny to pour salt into each sushi roll.   Finally when I was ready to leave after being seated so long with my food being complete I forgot the server had not yet given me the check and almost got up and left.   So overall, staff needs work. Chefs, they definitely need work.   And those mints.... were a lie! They were cinnamon!!",

    "text": "I haven't heard much about izakaya go, but I have seen so many pictures of their food online so I was excited to try it out. It was oddly cold this night so I decided to get some miso ramen to warm myself up. It wasn't as tasty as I wanted it to be. Too many green onions were placed in the bowl so that was all I tasted. The noodles were plentiful but a little too soggy. I wish it wasn't cooked so long. The opposite was True for the bean sprouts, which were a little too crunchy for my taste.   My friends and I came here for an early dinner, 6pm on a Saturday night. There was no crowd when we got there but it got busy after a while. Once the place filled up, it was hard to get service. The food also came out very slowly, one at a time. Probably 10-15 minutes in between each person's orders. Typically, this wouldn't bother me, but it's a little awkward when only one person has their food and everyone else is waiting for theirs. At the end of our meal, we looked at the wall and saw a sign that said free ice cream with a facebook check in. We asked the server about it and she seemed hesitant to give us the ice cream but after checking our facebook pages, she took our ice cream orders. I know this place has a lot more to offer. I'm excited to come back and try some of their other items!",

    "text": "The Skinny: the street food is great especially the takoyaki but fried items are just okay(3.5) the service was fast and efficient (4), value: very generous serving sizes for the price (3.5 bump up to 4 stars)   I was coming off a late night shift and hungry as hell. The hubs said why don't we try this izakaya in Chinatown. I am all in.   So we head to Izakaya Go which is tucked away in a small plaza behind a Starbucks.  Parking and is free but has a 80 minutes maximum in front of the restaurant.  Seeing how it was late and there was not much going on there,  this didn't bother us too much.   We were promptly seated and orders taken. Service is solid with complimentary hot green tea. (FYI -  iced green tea is never free... Don't ask me why but it is a Japanese thing).   Like most izakayas, the menu consists of many small dishes that go well with alcohol. Surprisingly,  there aren't any kushiyaki or yakitori on the menu. I also found it funny that they offered ramen and soba  First visit: takoyaki,  yakisoba,  tonkatsu dinner, buta kakuni.   The takoyaki was on the mark. This is the closest I've had to the takoyaki you get in Osaka's Dotombori district.  The batter is fluffy on the side,  crispy on the outside. Served with shaved Bonito flakes, mayo and takoyaki sauce,  it is totally delish and a great value for the price.   Yakisoba was another favorite.  The stir-fried noodles had a nice chew to it while the slightly charred (in a good way!)meat and vegetables gives a mild smokey flavor.   The stewed pork belly (buta kakuni) was a generous portion without too much fat. Marinated in a sweet soy base and served with a bit of mustard,  the meat was moist and delicious.  The tonkatsu dinner was a good value. Only thing is the tonkatsu crust is a bit too thick and heavy. Overall it was okay but nothing we need to order again.   Round 2: stir fried mushrooms,  sauteed spinach, miso glazed eggplant, California roll, crispy pork belly, karaage.   Stir fried mushrooms were great. Loved the buttery flavor with a nice sear.   California roll was pretty standard stuff. Okay but nothing to write home about.   Crispy pork belly texturally was too hard and a bit too salty. The karaage had similar problems plus was served with an aioli which was too heavy. Pass.   Miso eggplant was very sweet and could almost be categorized as candied eggplant. Pass.   Sauteed spinach was okay but really nothing special and a small portion to boot.   Given the food overall,  there were some hits and misses. But given the good items are so good,  it is enough to have me coming back for more. (3.5 bump up to 4 starred review).",

    "text": "Items Selected: Matcha Green Tea Takoyaki Hamachi kama Unagi bowl Salmon skin salad Miso Soup Battera Agedashi tofu Chicken Karaage Tuna Belly Steak Chawan Mushi Mushroom Zosui porridge Ten zaru soba with tempura Tororo Udon with grated mountain yam  Located just off Spring Mountain Road, cattycorner to Kuma Snow Cream, it was as part of a group of seven that a baker's dozen plates were ordered amidst the cozy confines of Izakaya Go and although palates I trust have recently offered the freshly opened space high commendations, our experience would prove to be just short of a disaster - the sort of meal that left one wondering how anyone could find such a place palatable, let alone worthy of praise.  Admittedly jam-packed, each seat in the house filled at the time of a 7:30 arrival, it was with advanced reservations that the group squeezed into a makeshift table best appointed for six, and with Izzy and Katie playing a bit too loudly from behind the bar a large menu was surveyed as water and hot tea were filled freely - the restaurant fresh out of green, but offering matcha or black over ice at $2.50 per glass.  Optimizing orders so as to cover a large swath of Izakaya Go's offerings it would not be long before first plates arrive and with creamy balls of fried octopus beneath bonito setting an extremely high bar it was unfortunate that no other plate would even come close to the quality of those tender fried orbs - least of all the grilled collar of tuna that was essentially charred dry leaving one to wonder whether the kitchen possessed any skill or integrity at all.  Essentially ruining a unagi bowl by burying the eel under too sweet a sauce over dried out rice one could say that the crispy salmon skin atop greens mixed with more bonito was the star of round two and with two small bowls of miso soup no better or worse than any other the box-sushi battera was additionally quite good, the savory smack of mackerel finding balance in vinegar and shiso, both.  Admittedly impressed by lightly fried agedashi tofu in more of the miso broth, but less so by fried chicken that was nearly as much batter as bird, it was onward to par-for-the-course egg custard that the meal progressed and with the previously forgotten tuna belly arriving with texture similar to the collar at the meal's beginning a single bite was more than enough for most - nearly half of the $12 order remaining on the table at meal's end.  Rounding out the evening in three bowls, the soba literally flavorless even when dipped in dressing while tempura served alongside was fairly competent and entirely full of grease, it was only at the meals end that both the mushroom porridge and hot udon topped with sticky yam would approach the level of the Takoyaki, but at this point bored with belabored service and annoyed by so much mediocrity all one really wanted to do was 'go.'  Perhaps suffering from high praise begetting a full house, maybe besmirched by a grill burning too hot, or - and I hope not - possibly deeming our table expendable as we were the only Caucasians in house the only real positive of dinner at Izakaya Go was the friends involved and $30/pp price - nothing save for the Takoyaki better than can be found elsewhere on Spring Mountain without the pop music, sub-par service, or overall lack of quality control.",

    "text": "\"New Izakaya Kid On The Block\"  ATMOSPHERE:  Tucked away in the former Koraku Ramen Spot, Izakaya Go is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with in the Izakaya arena. We stopped in for a quick bite and perusing the menu, it is an interesting spread with your usual lunch combination specials, as well as a section for Curry, their take on Asian fusion burgers and burritos, and an entire page of noodles. Clean inside, and no distracting TVs, but the counter full of congratulatory flowers kinda gave me the heebie-jeebies thinking I was in a funeral parlor...YIKES! Thank goodness that's temporary! The owner, Chef Go approached our table during our meal to see how our lunch was...always a plus to know that the Chef/Owner is actually in the restaurant cooking.  BITES/BEVERAGES:  I went with the Tonkatsu Lunch Combination($9.95) and we also decided to split a *Poki Burrito ($9.25) *should be spelled Poke, and is pronounced Po-keh, NOT Po-key, FYI...Hot tea is complimentary, just ask for a pot...Out of curiosity, I asked to see the dinner menu, and my eyes immediately zoomed in on the Uni Chawanmushi($6.25) which sounded pretty slammin' , so our waitress was nice enough to check with the kitchen if they could fire one up for us, and sure enough, they were able to! The lunch combinations served here have got to be the biggest ones I've seen! House salad, miso soup, tofu, takuan, and potato salad are included with your entree on one massive tray! My Tonkatsu was cooked to perfection, crisp, juicy, and not greasy at all. Poki Burrito(Think Jogasaki) was good but there was something HELLA SPICY in there! I grabbed a bite of Wifey's Enoki Mushroom and Shrimp Tempura from her Tempura Combo($9.95) tons better than that disastrous tempura at that Michelin starred chef's place... Oh man, the Chawanmushi? Money! loaded with mushrooms, shrimp, and uni, I would definitely devour this again!  CLOSING STATEMENTS:  Same plaza as KUMA Snow Cream on Valley View and Spring Mountain...  Remember, the lunch menu is totally different from the dinner selections  . The more traditional Izakaya items and Japanese dishes, and seafood specialities are on their dinner menu. However, if it's not busy at lunch and something on the dinner menu tempts you, just ask...they might just make it for you!  MASSIVE portions, great prices...you won't leave hungry here. Trust me....  Still have yet to explore dinner here...it's kind of a mix of Kyara, Soho, and Ichiza... Speaking of Ichiza, This may be a better option after Ichiza's constant run-ins with SNHD.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uu  4.5  Will I Return??? Oh yeah!",

    "text": "Izakaya Go (Pronounced \"Is-A-ka-ya\") is located in the same plaza right next to Krung Siam in Chinatown. I was lucky enough to have dinner here on Grand opening night even though it was packed and busy. The first thing you notice once you step inside is how well decorated the restaurant is. It just feels very welcoming and comfortable. The menu (sitting on the wall on strips of wood written in Japanese) brings a nostalgic feeling in me as I lived in Japan for almost 3 years.  Once seated on our table. We proceeded to order a vast variety of appetizers and entrees. Izakaya Go specializes in small dishes called tapas similar to what Ichiza offers. We started off with the Miso soup and Edamame (the staple starters in Japanese meals) the Miso soup tasted great and was authentic and the Edamame was a good snack. Then came the Kara Age \"KAH-rah-AH-geh\" which is a Japanese style fried chicken. It is traditionally marinated in soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. I would highly recommend the Kara Age here as it was a perfect balance between flavor, texture and richness.  We ordered the Crunch roll, California roll, Spicy tuna roll, Spicy tuna crackers, Tempura Platter, and Chicken Yakisoba. Everyone loved every dish that came out of the kitchen. The Chicken Yakisoba was one of the best versions of Yakisoba I've ever had. The quality of food is what I would expect as the head chef here has over 20 years experience as a chef from Kyoto Japan.  If you're in the mood for Japanese food, don't hesitate to give Izakaya Go a try. Once they acquire their liquor license (in process), they will be open late as well.",

A couple of my favorites are their Takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and Okonomiyaki (Osaka pancakes). The first time trying their ramen burger I thought it was great. But the next few times trying it I actually didn't think it was that good. The ramen noodles on the burger tend to be a little tough and hard to eat. I liked their mushroom porridge, it has a good flavor but nothing too out of the ordinary. The service is great and staff very friendly. However, I have mixed feelings about the taste and quality of their food so it's usually not my go-to place for Japanese tapas. But I like the fact that they stay open pretty late, so I'd definitely stop by for a midnight snack.",

The food is very delicious I would give the food 5 stars, apparently the service wasn't the best but I'm not going to take off a million stars for that.  They have this happy hour from 10 pm-closing and they have AMAZING happy hour options. If you want a bowl of ramen you can! For only $5 or if you wanna order some salmon handrolls it's like $5 too.  They also have this deal you can get a whole tray with katsu as the main dish with side dishes like salad and a miso soup for like $14 but guaranteed to fill you up.  The thing I like most about this place is that they have variety, it's not just like all Japanese tapas, I mean there are tapas, but there are also sushi or sashimi or ramen or katsu or fried tuna belly on a skewer.. and etc. plus did I also add this little place is also a bar? And they close around 2 am so you can eat/drink here late at night when almost everything else is closed.",

Takoyaki - a ball shape dough cooked in a special pan stuffed with a perfect piece of octopus, this place by far serves the best one I've ever had in Vegas. 5 stars  Grilled Tuna Belly (from the special's board) top quality fish grilled to perfection and lightly seasoned so the natural taste of the tuna stands out and with a not so over powering Ponzu Sauce was pretty good just unfortunately ours was a bit raw on the side almost made it felt like we were eating a seared fish but we still ate it all because it was still tasty. 4.3 stars   Uni Chawan Mushi is their egg custard with veggies topped with sea urchin was just amazing. Very gentle and subtle to the palate with the combination chosen. Better word for it... comfort food like a Japanese version of chicken noodle soup for the soul 5 stars  Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage might not be for everyone. But if you're like me who loves that part of the chicken then this is a must order! If you have eaten this before then you'll know what the texture is all about but it's battered and deep fried so it's masked and once you eat it... it's so weird in a good way. By far my favorite thing to order every time I go here 5 stars  Deep Fried Octopus it's octopus and it's deep fried... need I say more? The mayo dipping sauce was a bit too much for me I prefer it with just the lemon and seasoning in tbh 4.4 stars  Karage Chicken at the time when I ordered it, I felt it was a bit heavy on the salty side. I had to squeeze 2 lemons to balance out that sharp salty taste from my tongue. Maybe I just had a bad batch thay night.  I'll order it again to see if it changes 3.4 stars  Still have more foods to review... will post when I get the time .. lol  Don't forget to say hi to Go, he's amazing and I believe owns the place. His soothing choice of music to play reggae in his restaurant has me coming back for more because it's just so laid back, perfect lighting,  good vibes, alcohol, no tv so you can actually conversate with people you're with there and you can't go wrong with his prices. Let's just say I've been going here once a week and it's definitely not my last :)",

The unagi was more tender than usual, which lent to more emphasis on the flavor, rather than texture (and the flavor was exceptional).  Sashimi aside, the sunomono, especially the ume and the kyuuri were full of pop.  The kalbi ribs were ok.  Probably a little too much char.

The ramen burger was a bit too sweet for my taste. Matthew Tartare was a big hit for us. Poke roll turned out to be disappointing since it looked more like a standard cut tuna roll.  Service was generally good though i did feel a bit of impatience from the waitress since we took some time to decide what we wanted even though the place was still quite empty (since we came when it just opened up.). The ambiance was like a sports bar with the World Series playing loudly on at least 3 big screen TVs. Beer is cold.  Overall we would come back and I'm glad we tried this place out.  Dont forget to ask for the free ice cream when checking in on Yelp.",

We went late night, they have a HH from 10PM - close, great prices. We got a bunch of stuff to share: - Tonkatsu & shio ramens (come spicy so if you don't like spicy request mild. These were ok, your basic ramen soup. Nothing special) - Yaki soba (way too sweet, wasn't a fan) - Poke hand roll (basic, pretty good) - Tuna Tartare Yukke (surprisingly pretty spicy, great flavors w/ imitation crab meat underneath and chunks of avocado, raw egg on top) - Pork belly yakitoro (very basic. Grilled pork on a skewer w/ a lime. No special seasonings) - Bream sashimi (not on HH menu, but best thing we ordered. Very fresh, then they take the bones and deep fry for you and bring back. You also have the option of making it into a miso fish bone soup)  All in all - pretty good place. Would come back, especially for the HH prices!",

    "text": "A hidden gem in Chinatown.  Environment: The restaurant itself is located almost in a hidden location in the back of a plaza near the main Chinatown center. It can be a little hard to find, and the restaurant itself is not too big. However inside they make use of their small allotment of space and have booths, tables, sushi bar seating, as well as a large middle area which could be used for big parties. Additionally, the decorations and lighting make the restaurant fun and cozy.  Food: Their menu is very expensive and ranges from sushi and sashimi to kushiyaki. We could try carpaccio, skewers, oysters, rolls, and much more. The sashimi was very fresh and the oysters were delicious. Additionally, we tried chicken heart skewers which were surprisingly good as well.  Service: Service was good as well, with our server being sure to stop by periodically throughout our meal to check up on us and ask if we would like to place anymore orders (which we usually did).  Overall Izakaya Go is comparable to my favorite Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, Ichiza, and I see myself coming back to dine here again.",

    "text": "Wow... what else can I say? This is a small little restaurant that is easy to miss. We walked in and it was very cramped with the tables close together and very little wiggle room. It's a tight but very pleasant atmosphere. The first thing they do is give you a LOT of menus, I think we had 3-4 on our table for both of us. It's really confusing at first, but once you sort through what each menu is for, then you can start to make decisions.   We started with the Octopus Carpaccio and it was absolutely amazing (see picture). It is pricey, but worth the experience. It was thinly sliced and not chewy at all. Whatever they do to it makes it well worth the price. For our main course, we had the ramen and it was wonderful as well. Lasty, we had some Eel yakitori which was heavenly (see picture).   Another thing worth mentioning is the Green Tea. I don't know what they do to make it taste so good, but it's the best Green Tea I have ever had (and I usually don't like Green Tea).  Lastly, don't be in a rush here. When you order something, keep in mind that they are making it from scratch and you may have to wait a bit. When we ordered the Eel, it took about 15 minutes to get it (at it wasn't very busy). So... have some patience and you will be rewarded handsomely with some of the best food.",

The texture of the fish in the Poke Chips was tough and did not look nor taste edible.  The bluefin toro was chewy and I had to spit out a piece which I could not fully chew down.  Grilled smelt was bitter and meat was mushy, stale.  Never been to a Japanese restaurant where they put Korean sake on their wine list.  At least the waitress was honest and told us their fish is really not fresh. The decor looks legit but sadly every dish that came out was really off; quality and ingredients not genuine Japanese cuisine.",

It's a small, quaint restaurant, a lot of booths and tables that can seat more than it looks. My husband was surprised the horigotatsu could seat more than 8 people! It was both our first time there so we weren't sure what to expect. The employees were very fast, our orders came out almost immediately. And that was awesome because I was starving! lol. I was excited to try the uni pasta, chawan mushi, and well...pretty much everything. ;) their uni pasta was $17 and it came in a generous portion. It was creamy and filling. They gave a generous amount of uni topping. The chawan mushi was really good as well. My husband enjoyed it (it was his first time). I enjoyed every single dish that we ordered. We will definitely be back again. Checking in on yelp also scored us a free ice cream! I opted for the green tea ice cream and it was the perfect dessert to end our date night.",

They do not take reservations.  High quality food esp for the price and the size of the menu, I was not disappointed. I can't wait to return to Vegas for this! Currently, if you check in on yelp, you get a free ice cream!! YUM! The ice cream was very soft and yummy. (They had vanilla or green tea as flavors for you to choose from).  Lots of small plates to share (or order for yourself, TREAT YOURSELF! LOL) We went with 4 people so we ordered quite of bit of food but everything was pretty good!  Takoyaki - yummm Octopus fried flour balls with sauces. It is so good! There's actually decent amounts of octopus in it. The texture is not for everyone because it is squishy with pieces of octopus in it.  Eel fresh water skewer- MUST MUST MUST At first when someone asked me if I wanted eel, I quickly said no thinking it was just like a piece of eel that you get on top of rice. I thought it was a typical eel sushi. I WAS WRONG. This was SOOOOO good. It def tasted fresh, juicy, flavorful.   Fried Chicken Skin skewer - Yes!!! Whatever sauce that comes in it, is pretty good as well. This was so crispy! It was like... bacon! If you love bacon, you'll def love this. Same sort of texture. It small of course, but def so good.   Ramen Tonkotsu -  Skip If you are normally a huge fan of tonkotsu, I recommend you skipping on this. The pork that comes in it tastes REALLY REALLY good, however the broth of the his ramen seemed plain with no flavor. I also asked for it to be spicy.. but again no flavor. I will not order this again.   Ramen Spicy Miso - good. My husband ordered he Spicy Miso to try and much to my surprise it was actually really flavorful, creamy and had way more taste than the other ramen.   Chicken Karrage - Would order it again over Ramen. This was not as crunchy as I had hopped, but it was still good. They had big pieces of chicken thigh. I like to dip it in the sauce and squeeze lemon on it. Chicken Karrage is one of my \"i always order it if they offer it on the menu\" no matter where I go..   Fried Baby Octopus - MUST Tastes very fresh, very crunchy, squeeze lemon on it. It is like.. calamari but.. octopus. A whole baby octopus. Whatever flour they use to fry it , made it not too hard. Just the right amount of fried.   Pork Belly skewer - good cooked just right, smokey, juicy, even the sauce on it is good.   Fried soft shell crab - so good  - it is fried and soft all in one. It was really good. one order has two soft shell crabs that is cut in half.",

    "text": "Absolutely come by this place. Unfortunately, the lighting is dim. Which is great for ambience but not so great for pictures... haha. So forgive me for the lack of pictures. I got one of the takoyaki at least!  So I thought the takoyaki was pretty good! I would say that the only downside was that it had a little too much dough. But it was crispy on the outside and piping hot on the inside. Just the way I like it :)  The tempura was great for the price. They give you like three pieces of shrimp and a wide variety of assorted vegetables including sweet potato, mushroom, etc. it is a little on the lukewarm side though.   OKAY - now the real reason to come here. THE SKEWERS!!! Yes!!! They do the yakitori so perfectly here. It reminds me of the shops in Japan. Absolutely get the chicken skin, chicken cartilage, and pork cheek. Seriously you will not regret it. Seriously worth the trip here, just to get those.   A couple of downsides, they ran out of the okonomiyaki and the tuna belly skewer... and we were the first customers on a Friday night. So it's a little disappointing. However, this place is still worth the visit, because the meat skewers were really THAT worth it. Yum!",

    "text": "Summary:  Reallly great and fresh sashimi. Came here and was blown away by how great the food was. By the time we finished and left there was a line out the door waiting for ppl to be seated. This was definitely a local favorite and I'm glad I found it!   Parking: 6/10 good parking lot with decent parking   Service: 10/10 great service and friendly staff. They recommended all the local favorites as well as items I have never heard of but said I needed to try.   Pricing: 10/10 for being a quality restaurant the pricing was very reasonable. I think being off the strip allows them to be real with their pricing bc they don't need the glam of Vegas. This place is honest with their prices and it shows with the amount of ppl who come here.    Trend level: authentic Japanese style! Even had tables where you can sit on the floor !   Overall: if I had to come back to Las Vegas this would 100% be a place I come back to.",

    "text": "Im excited to write this review as our last few days have been eventful! Let's start off with  Location: it's conveniently located away from the busier side of the chain of Asian stores and restaurants.   Exterior: plenty of parking spaces as it's on the end of a  shared mini plaza.   Interior: Japanese themed, with low tables and mat for seating, we had our kids so we sat at the booth tables that can fit 3 per side, pretty clean inside and a bar for drinks.   We started with our order of drinks and quick view of the menu and were surprised by the selection! There are so many to choose from I didn't know where to start, everything sounded so delicious and more on the exotic side which is my type of menu. We ordered Tako Wasa which is a very strong scented wasabi raw octopus, miso soup, & edamame as appetizers.   For our mains we ordered soft shell crab, New Zealand green mussels, truffle butter corn, chard pork belly skewers and quail wrapped in bacon.   There is so much to offer and we were very very pleased with the few selections we made and plan on 3+ visits to complete the want to try list! The truffle butter corn & mussels were def a highlight for us. The rush of flavors will give you a  face without disappoint!",

I didn't think they'd take reservations during happy hour. We actually ended up only having 10ppl show up. We fit comfortably in the middle area where there's a horigotatsu thing going on. We had to take our shoes off when we entered that area. Cute Japanese style. We ordered a bunch of food from the happy hr menu for the table.  We got oysters, truffle edamame, albacore handroll, uni bowl, gyudon, & shumai. Everyone enjoyed the food. No complaints. I ordered the salmon ikura donburi for myself (not part of happy hour). So glad I did, I LOVE their rice! It's True sushi rice. And their salmon was so soft. And I'm glad I liked their ikura. Some restaurants have different tasting ikura that has a chemical taste, in my opinion. But I liked theirs :)  Service was great and they were able to serve a big party. Atmosphere was fun; everyone around us were enjoying themselves also. Great place to come and chill with your friends and enjoy GOOD FOOD!!",

The menu has a smorgasbord of Japanese food, anything from ramen, street food, with sushi rolls, sashimi, and whatever else is on their specials menu at the time.  I don't think they excel on any one True dish. I ordered a variety of things and everything was good but not excellent. I tried the takoyaki, okonomiyaki, yakitori, baked mussels, and more that I can't remember. I've had better versions of each dish in other restaurants. Their uni chawanmushi (egg custard with seafood) is very good, and something that not many restaurants offer.  But if you're here to grab a few beers without overpaying on Japanese food, and you don't want to be too far away from the Strip, this is a solid izakaya.",

We ordered five things: the takoyaki, pancake, teriyaki chicken, New Zealand lamb skewer, and the night special curry udon. Everything was super flavorful and the right side of crispy. I especially loved the curry udon. It was more soupy than I was expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise! It had rich flavor, perfect saltiness, and a decent amount of meat and noodles with spinach as a topping.   The only con was that the seating space is a little tight, but the establishment is a little smaller. No one was close enough to knock into me or anything though, just a personal preference for more space.   Overall, the service was good, the food came out in a timely manner, and most of all, it was delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to other people.",

There's usually too much mayonnaise, and strange fusion of ingredients. Chef is trying to be innovative, but we are just conservative and like the standard stuff.",

They had a ramen burger off menu that was huge! It tasted just like a bowl of ramen right in the form of a burger. The meat is soy sauce pork like in typical ramen.   I also had a dragon roll which is also off menu that came out great! The eel was fresh and cut perfectly. It's a great place to come anytime!   It's open from 5am to 2am Monday through Thursday and 5 to 3 am the other days.   Choi was definitely a great waitress that kept me and my company entertained. She definitely lighten up our night.   I definitely recommend this place!",

It wasn't that we had shitty service or the food wasn't good the first time, it's just we never got all the items we ordered...   I must say tho we are glad we came back. We got everything we ordered this time and all the food was excellent. The service was great our server Khiet was really nice and made sure everything was going well... The other two guys that took our other half of our order and checked in on us where awesome aswell...   We ordered the grilled pork cheek with gingered scallions, that was really good!!! Definitely a Must order!! Another dish I really like here is the Garlic squid fried rice, imo it's a must try aswell!!!  We also got the standard Truffle edamame, spicy and California cut rolls. Half ramen with spicy miso, and a bunch of yakitori items...   The happy hour that starts at 10pm is great and I highly recommend giving this place a try!!!",

We ordered the fried squid legs (my favorite), spicy salmon rolls, salmon handrolls, half a tonkatsu spicy ramen, chicken meatball skewer, tomato bacon skewer, pumpkin croquette and many more items.

    "text": "Ramen soup addiction cannot be countered by anything else. Okay well I haven't given any sushi a chance here. I don't even know how extensive their sushi menu is since my eyeballs search directly for the ramen noodles; aside from their skewer apps since it's on a separate piece of paper.  Shiyo and Miso ramen are checked off my list. Next up Shoyu and Tonkatsu. The waitress mentioned they have Tonkatsu ramen now ooooooh :D. I was able to order with the hot oil on the side. It's a killer spicy level and didn't need much to cause nose dripping... No not in my bowl thilly wabbits.  I save the egg for last. Not sure why I do it but always eaten after all my noodles are gone. Please don't watch me too closely when I eat ramen. Uuuuh you'll find me sifting through what's left of the broth trying to get every last bit of noodle. Warning: it might annoy you.   On their skewer appetizer list, we've stuck to the greens: okra, asparagus, zucchini. For a chubby treat we tried bacon wrapped okra. Seven seconds off our lives for each bacon strip? I dunno, then there goes almost half a minute. I think swallowing chewed gum is worse.  So cute in this place. The center of the seating area has a large table for traditional Japanese dining... I think... Cuz guests removed their shoes. But then again I might've seen them sitting properly as if on a bench. It's a cool addition to a dining experience here. This particular table area in the center is like the centerpiece to the rest of the restaurant.  Haven't tried sake yet - surprising myself with that since I used to go sake tasting in the OC quite a bit. So they've got an assortment of bottles displayed on the corner wall and behind the bar. The beers are Kirin and Asahi.  We've been served by the same two people each visit. Just want to acknowledge their hard work. Service is good considering how busy. Keep up the friendliness and smiles. You're doing a fine job.  Looking forward to the next dining splurge. I almost went again tonight. However I didn't want to bore my appetite even though I kept thinking of their ramen noodle soup.  The current Yelp rating speaks for itself. Diners love it - always full house every time I've dropped in. Yaaaay full bellies!!! Stay happyyyyy!",

It was just like Hondaya in Tustin, CA which I have been really wishing would come to vegas so I didn't have to keep choosing that place every time I go back home.   Service was an INTERESTING start.... not too friendly... but once I started to order things got different. All the staff were smiling & coming by to check up on us. They all greeted us bye very loud & genuinely.  Atmosphere is just how I would have imagined it. Wood furniture w/ cushions & has that whole Japanese late-night bar hangout place. Plus they are open late so it's my go-to after a hard day's work!!!   Now since they are a tapas style.... this is what I ordered.  PUMPKIN CROQUETTE $1.50 AGE DASHI MOCHI $3.95 DEEP FRIED SOFT SHELL SHRIMP $6.50 GRILLED MOCHI W/ COD ROE CHEESE $5.95 SAUTEED BUTTER MUSHROOMS $4.95 LIVE FRESH OCTOPUS $14.95 - ehhh I wouldn't order it again   HALIBUT CARPACCIO W/ UNI $14.95 SEA URCHIN PASTA $- lots of UNI flavor yummm TRUFFLED BUTTER CORN ON HOT PAN $4.95- definitely pass on this one cuz it has NO TRUFFLE taste at all DEEP FRIED SQUID LEGS - their squid legs are perfect!

    "text": "By far my favorite casual Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas....hands down....so many items, great pricing, great food.  What I have ordered:  Ramen Burger - Instagrammable as fuck...better than most \"Ramen Burgers\" i've had and they have slabs of pork belly in the middle instead of a burger patty like most places.  Gindara - One of my favorites with that fatty, buttery, sweet flavor of the Alaskan Cod. Fire.  Okonomiyaki - not the best i've had like the now dead Gottsui in LA (RIP) but respectable enough to get it every single time i'm there....  Omakase Delicacies - 3 small tastings of 3 different delicacies for the adventurous mothafuckas...all i can say is that two are ok but the shark cartilage...fuck that...  Miso Marinated Salmon Bowl - another item we basically get every damn time...fire  Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab - not a fan of soft shell crab because of the texture of basically feeling like you chewing on your nails...  Spicy Fried Rice w/ Jidori Chicken - it's a given, if you fuck up fried rice you def should not have a restaurant...again another item we order almost every time....  Tuna Belly Steak - Good fat portion however lacking flavor and would rather eat most seafood raw....  Skewers - Great selection and flavor  Curry Rice & Beef Steak - Not the best curry in town but the best steak that is paired with curry for sure...especially for the price for happy hour...  Karaage - I grew up on this style of fried chicken...not the best but good enough to satisfy my craving for it...  Dango - Dessert mochi balls that are fire...  Yuzu Cheesecake - subtle yuzu flavor...  I know there is a lot more items we have ordered just can't remember them all...  Highly recommend if you fuck with Ichiza cause between the two you can't go wrong....",

Only reason give this place a 4 Star is due to ordering the grill salmon belly they forgot to put in the order and as well it came out really salty. But over all would come back when i come to Las Vegas every year with my group.",

So previous visitS...  -found hair (our server offered us  free appetizer as an apology) -Waited TOO long for the food to come in (about 40mins and ramen wasnt even served yet. Also rice took extra 10mins)  btw its busy but not too busy to the point theres waiting list.  -fruit fly on our water (its okay since they cant really control that)  Tonight's visit...(ordered for pick up) -gave us miso ramen instead of tonkotsu (went back to get the right one) We werent mad or anything....once we got home and opened all the food...-REALLY small portion of takowasabi (I always order that so I know) -found hair  I was just a lil irritated cause so many things happened in one order :(  I love their food so I cant give them bad rating. Im just unfortunate when it comes to ordering food.",

It's got a quaint atmosphere and is a great place to come watch a Golden Knights game or just sports in general. Their Ramen is superior to every other ramen joint in the valley and they are actually making authentic yakitori which is phenomenal. I have yet to have anything bad from this restaurant which is legitimately my favorite place in town. These people legitimately need to expand their foot print and open up a few more of these joints. This is just a really chill nice place to grab a beer, watch a game and eat some phenomenal food. Don't miss out!",

This is located in Chinatown in a shopping center that's not as busy as the other parts of town. The server who helped us that evening was very nice. The food was pretty tasty and everything I ordered was good, as well as the other orders I sampled at our table.   My order:  ~Pumpkin Croquettes: MmM! ~Crispy Pork Belly with a side of white rice: delightful :) ~Goma-ae: Boiled Spinach in sesame dressing: great side  The only reason I deducted a star was the weird order of the food coming out. First and foremost my food came out first which was cool, but then no other orders were coming out for a really long time. The orders were coming out at random timing with really long gaps.. so basically we all could not eat at the same time. By the time the ramen came out everybody was done eating except for that last person. That was super sad and strange, I don't understand the back up and it was really awkward to watch the last person eat while we were all done.. it's like the last order was forgotten and never placed to begin with.   Overall, a decent spot, with a great variety.. however just beware of the interesting service. (:",

It is evident that the oil used for tempura is recycled and used for an array of dishes. You can taste \"animal fat\" when you bite into your vege tempura. No Bueno!!! Everything tasted the same...I guess they have one sauce and use that on all of their dishes. The beer and water were the best things we ordered.",

The whole skewer about 1/4\"x2.5\", smaller than my pinky finger (and i have small hands).  Our fatty chicken hearts (2 skewers) both came out 1/3 burnt, smoked like used up matches  Hamachi collar (grilled fish) was drier than chicken breast, almost shattering that we needed spoon to make any scoop of it.  Foods (there were many others as it was ordered for shared) were very dissapointing: from sushi, salads, fries ... heck, from entree to desserts.  I am awed how they could mess up at ice cream! Like how cheap do you have to go on ingredients that ice cream (vanilla and green tea) could taste so  poor?!  Also, we ordered crepe cake, which came out only after we waited so long that we told the waitress we want to cancel it.  It was also funny how different waitress brought out the cake and the bill, pretending the cake came out before one of the waitress canceled it per our request... there was about 5min waiting between the cancel and the cake and a little less for the bill. The restaurant was not busy at all, and it's a small place.  I m being very generous giving them a 2 star :-(",

For such a small place they had a lot of entrees to choose from so I picked a variety of them from each section. The food arrived slower than expected but was definitely worth the wait. The server was very attentive and made sure our water and if anything were needed. Also the person that sat us in the beginning came by quite often to make sure we were doing okay also. Definitely a place to visit off the main strip to eat and relax!",

    "text": "Lost Wages has tons of Asian eateries in the Chinatown Spring Mountain corridor.  Blocks and blocks of Asian strip malls with many opening until late, late in the night.  IG is one of those Izakayas opening until 2am with happy hour(s) special from 10pm to 2am.  This town truly does not sleep.  Their menu is extensive with a large variety of imported fish for Nigiri traditionalists in addition to modern, hip, menu items for those Asian fusionists.  OMG...  stupid comment by me, Las Vegas ain't near any ocean so it's all imported...lol.  Arrived at 9:40pm and grabbed a table with no line.  Took a picture around 9:45pm and wondered what all the Yelp fuss was about as the Sushi Bar and the center Tatami seating area were empty.  In 20 minutes the place was filled with happy hour peeps.  Lots of regulars.... three menus (regular, specials, happy hour) and sushi list brought to our booth table (establishment seats around 60 at most).  Ice Water brought to the table with ice melting before we even ordered (100 degrees outside and comfortable 75 degrees?? Inside) as it took awhile to peruse the various menus.  You'll find something....  Our foursome had: - Imported Omakase Four Fish Nigiri Special (Fresh) - Uni Pasta (Creamy) - Salmon & Ikura Don - Sushi Crunch Burrito - Grilled Salmon Bento - Takoyaki  Overall, a foodie and drinkie place that you should check out on a visit to Lost Wages.  So many choices!!!  Liked the Uni Pasta the best.  Please note -  don't have any belongings visible in the car... they have had break-in problems.",

It is very small (maximum 70 capacity) so go early or bring your patience to get a table when it's busy. It was packed by the time we left so it was a good thing we arrived early to celebrate. If you have to, the food is definitely worth the wait!! Everything we ordered was delicious and came out on a timely manner. My favorite was the ikayaki. Perfectly cooked and fresh.  Great service too. They played \"happy birthday\" music and put candles on my bday cake when they brought it out to the table. Definitely a special touch to a specific occasion!!",

I ordered the mini uni don, which was deliciously fresh creamy Santa Barbara uni and ikura on a bed of sushi rice, wasabi octopus, bluefin tuna handroll and a vegetarian udon soup. Yesss, this was all for just me and I was one happy and full camper.   The sushi here is fresh and affordable. Can you believe all this and my bill was under $34? Do yourself a favor and take a uber off the strip to grab some amazing Japanese food without making a big dent in your wallet!",

I was comfortable and really enjoyed  the vibe in there.  The menu is pretty big. Appetizers (cold and hot), sushi, sashimi, fried dishes, steamed dishes, stir fry, dinner plates (teriyaki, etc), salads, noodles, and my favorite: grilled dishes and skewers!   We ordered a lot of food: Rock shrimp (fried), grilled beef short ribs, grilled eggplant, chicken thigh skewers, chicken skin skewers, chicken wings, agedashi tofu, crispy pork belly, and an unagi bowl!   My favorite item was definitely the chicken skin skewers. Cooked over coals, they had a slight crunch and a drizzle of sauce.   The service was awesome. Our drinks were never empty, and the food came out at a good pace to keep us \"busy\" the entire time.   I highly recommend this restaurant. It does get crowded at dinner time so if you don't want to wait for a table, make a reservation or show up earlier in the evening before everyone else shows up!",

Our server was very friendly, kept our drinks fresh and checked on us frequently.   Good stuff  All the pork, shashimi, and salad dishes the table ordered were on point as usual.  Flavorful and fresh all around.  However, this visit I discovered the truffle buttered corn which was fantastic.  I love all three ingredients that make up this simple but flavorful dish and it's a definite must order on future visits.  Izikaya Go continues to be another great food option on Spring Mountain Blvd.   Arigato!",

The uni shumai, sea urchin wrapped in soft dumplings, looked great at the next table. Something I should try next time. Another interesting option is the torched uni, it's supposed to arrive with a slightly smoky sear.  Despite being located in a blah crackerjack strip mall, the interior design is nice but it's due for a little facelift. There's also a communal table for large parties with seiza-style seating. The menu is extensive, with ramen being only a small part. Here, your choices are shio, shoyu, or miso ramen, all spicy and all made with a chicken broth base. They also have an excellent sake and soju selection.  I really liked the uni rice bowl. It had about three nice pieces of uni on top of a small side bowl of rice. Really great value at about $11 or $12 each and the taste was good.",

The food however, is amazing. The appetizer buta kaku (dunno if i spelled it right, the braised pork belly) was by far the best.   I ordered Ikura Chazuke which was alright, halibut carpaccio which only came with 4 pieces was good but not worth it in my opinion.   Gf ordered Unagi Don which was also expensive but tasted good. Not enough Unagi considering the rice ratio.   Steamed sake clams was yummy and came with roughly 9 clams.  The $1 oyster was awesome and a steal considering they are roughly $2+ per oyster in Hawaii. Maybe it was cheap because of the Happy hour.   Plenty of options here with a big menu and skewer options.  Gave it 4 stars because the wait time was longer than waiting for a pleasant old person who is handicap getting off the bus.  Try it!

Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was pretty fast too. Two of us had the tempura soba (the tempura was crispy with a decent selection of shrimp and vegetables), a sushi roll, fried rice, gyozas and edamame. My husband said that the fried rice met his approval and believe me, he is an expert on it. One of our friends ordered the beef teriyaki combo-it looked good and he said that it was tasty. The meat was not overcooked and was tender. The edamame was cooked perfectly and had some salt sprinkled on it. Just the way I like them.  We'll definitely go back there next time we're in town. And an added plus is that they are open late and takes reservations.",

As far as variety of food - this place has a lot. They have a daily specials menu which is always good to try. The chefs do know what's best for the day, after all. On to the food!   We started with the fresh shigoku oysters - super fresh, meaty and clean tasting. Perfectly dressed and lightly sauced with ponzu. Highly recommend it if you're into raw oysters.  Ankimo- monkfish liver - every Japanese restaurant seems to have their own way of preparing it - this one was delicious. It was not gamey at all and had a great texture. I just wish there was a little bit more for the price.   Next up - omakase nigiri of the day - uni, rock shrimp, yellowtail and tuna - all super fresh and of high quality. A good value at $15 for these 4 pieces of heaven  Skewers (aka yakitori) - you can't go to an izakaya and not get some skewers! Beef tongue was marinated nicely, not gamey. Great texture. Okra hot off the grill is amazing if you've never tried it. I figured I'd try chicken breast with (fresh) wasabi and it was quite delicious.   Black pork sausage - very good. Perfectly seasoned, grilled to perfection. Served with ketchup and mustard.   Stir fried chicken liver - slightly gamey but full of flavor and delicious if you're into it.   Uni risotto -  that's all I have to say. If you like uni and you like risotto, you better just order it.",

Tip:    If you sashimi a whole fish (it's like $20, for now), you can ask the server to take the head and make it into miso soup (cost extra) after you finish the dish.  It's worth it.  Also, the wasabi comes with whole fish are top notch, must try.  The only thing I am a little bit disappointed is the sting ray fin (no, this is NOT shark fin).... the quantity has been greatly reduced lately, but quality is still decent...oh well...  Note that this place does not open during the lunch time, and you better go early or late.... unless you are willing to wait in line.  Uni (sea urchin)'s origin can be different from time to time, check with Chef or owner if you are a very particular/advance Japanese foodie.  With that being said, so far I haven't had anything disappointed by their uni or raw food, not even once.",

Make a reservation (pro tip) for a 10pm happy hour and people watch and eat and drink some great food. I've had good and not so good experiences here over the years but I keep coming back which says something about the people working there and the whole vibe of the leg night crowds.  Izakaya Go is always a a go to and a recommendation for any late night diner visiting this great city.",

We showed up right as they opened at 5 PM and that was a smart move as the place is not so big and it was fully packed by 5:30. We ordered a variety of dishes. Keep in mind, this is like a tapas size portion which makes it perfect for a group to try out a variety of things. We ate sashimi, beef tongue, pork belly, pork cheek, ramen soup, and a few other things. The food was phenomenal and the service was just as great. The prices were very reasonable. Be ready to wait a little as you sit back and enjoy your beer, cocktail, or sake. Don't worry, they take their time to make sure you are getting the best possible product from presentation to the explosion of flavor that comes with each dish. Highly recommended!",

Also happy hour is 10pm - close (2am or 3am) It's a perfect after work type of place! Staff has been always friendly to me and even make me laugh at points.

Was so delicious ended up ordering 2 more orders.  Also had the Amberjack Sashimi and the quality was on point.  I'm a big fan of Naked Fish because of the quality, but Izakaya Go had fish just as fresh and high quality at a fraction of the price. Firefly Squid- YUM! tiny itty bitty baby squid served raw with a miso sauce.. To die for.. So amazingly fresh! Poke bowl had high quality tuna, Ramen Burger was savory, the pork cooked to tender perfection.  Seriously considered ordering extra noodle \"buns\" to take home with me to snack on later.   Huge menu selection, lots to choose from for everyone, had so many intriguing items.   Owner himself took the initial order, staff super friendly and accommodating, great atmosphere, comfy seating.  Honestly wish I found this place earlier.  Been going to Ichiza for years but will definitely make the switch to Izakaya Go for Japanese tapas!   Recommend that you go now while they're still in their initial stages of opening- this place WILL have a wait once people start realizing what a great little restaurant this is.",

Once you find it, you won't regret it.  Love that it's bustling with crowd, servers are efficient although dishes come quite slowly, and the food is favorable to Ichiza.  Battera was better than Ichiza although not as good as Yu-Yu's, and I found other items to be fresh and quite good.  While I only had a hot sake, they have a good choice of bottled sakes to choose from.  Be prepared to shell out some $ for those though...  Table-for-1 Factor:  It's an izakaya, so I don't think you'll want to sit here alone.  But they do have bar seats.",

    "text": "I was actually a little disappointed in izakaya go, the interior was a little small but didn't pose a problem finding a seat. We ordered the Takoyaki, cooked ika tentacles in butter, uni pasta, and the ramen burger (both their most popular dishes). The uni pasta when it came out had a funky smell which was not appetizing at all, but the smell was deceptive. The pasta was rich and creamy, and tasted of a light fishy version of an Alfredo with onions and..who'd of guessed it? Uni. The Takoyaki was okay and came with 10 pieces, but I really didn't see anything out of the ordinary in this dish. The ika had a good flavor of light citrus and butter, but had a crunchy uncooked texture rather than the tender texture like the ika butter at kyaras tapas. I wasn't a fan of the texture since it was a little more difficult to chew and digest. The ramen burger wasn't very much impressive either. It just tasted like soggy ramen smothered in pulled pork and onions. The sauce was too strong on it, and the ramen buns had a very unappetizing texture and plain flavor. Service was mediocre, our waitress was nice but when our food came out, our chef looked very annoyed or uninterested and spoke very quietly and monotoned like he just wanted to leave and go sleep in the corner.  Over-all, for a fine dining establishment, I didn't feel the fine dine experience at all and left a little dissatisfied. I probably wouldn't come back, but i suppose it's worth a try if you haven't ever been yet.",

    "text": "Went to this restaurant on a road trip back from colorado with my gf and my bro. We were all pretty hungry as we had been driving all day in an effort to get back to LA ASAP. My bro and I split an order of the albacore sushi and the spicy tuna rolls. I ordered baby octopus as we all finished eating since I was still a little hungry. He ordered a poke sushi burrito. My gf ordered the shoyu ramen. We also ordered a few beers.  What I enjoyed about the restaurant: -Awesome fresh tasting sushi at a pretty reasonable price. The amount of food and the quality are both definitely worth what we paid.  -My gf enjoyed the meat in her ramen and we both enjoyed the texture of her noodles. -The beef ponzu was seriously on point. The texture of the beef and the umami flavor of the ponzu sauce was pleasant while also not being too salty. It came with two dumplings, rice, and two edamame-looking peppers, and a light salad with a pretty flavorful dressing (again, not too overbearing flavor wise).  What is left to be desired: -The service is definitely wanting. Other customers at one point felt kind of dissatisfied with how long their food was taking. I ordered a small order of baby octopus while still in the middle of our meal and it took over twenty minutes after I ordered that dish until it finally came out. It's a relatively small restaurant; sorry, but I view that as poor service. -The broth of my gf's ramen did not taste particularly appealing. It had a slight fishy taste even though the ramen she ordered came with pork- I find this a little strange. She also ordered the ramen extra spicey; this ramen was not even remotely spicey.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and left satisfied and full. It definitely hit the spot. There are SEVERAL amazing restaurants in Vegas however, so it may be a while before I come back to this restaurant. Considering the value for my money, I don't see why I wouldn't- just not anytime soon.",

    "text": "***DO NOT COME HERE. IT'S NOT SANITARY***  I hate writing bad reviews but this one was a must. Found this place on Yelp and wanted a change from the food on the Strip. First of all, parking was terrible. It's in a little strip mall with limited parking as all the competing storefronts were vying for the same spots. When we walked up to the restaurant, we weren't sure if it was even opened because the storefront was so dark. Upon entering, it didn't look too busy and we were quickly seated in the booth.   Let me start of with I love izakayas. I've been to many in New York City and always had wonderful experiences. Japanese tapas-styled restaurants that let you try a little bit of everything and provides for a casual and comfortable dining experience, what more can you want? Having said that, I really wanted to like this place due to all the glowing reviews it had.  The menu was very vast as expected with a regular menu and a board with the specials for the day. I came with my family so we for our appetizers, we ordered a rainbow roll, a salmon avocado (Alaskan) roll, sashimi platter (3 kinds of fish), takoyaki, and beef tataki to be split amongst the four of us. For entrees, we got the shoyu ramen, kake udon, and yakisoba, and poke salad.   The octopus in the takoyaki was a little cold but nonetheless it wasn't bad. The batter was nice and light and the sauce and dried bonito shavings were good. None of the fish for the sushi and the sashimi seemed fresh at all. The beef tataki was forgettable. Now onto the entrees, the portion sizes seemed a little smaller than I'm used to but that's fine because we did have a lot of appetizers to fill our bellys. The broth was ok but wasn't super rich with flavor. A little on the bland side. But right as my mom started eating her kake udon, she but into something crunchy in the spinach. She split it out to see what it was and it was a aphid in her spinach! She didn't want to make a scene so she just pushed it away and stopped eating it. But one of the employees came and wanted to see what was going on. We told them what happened and showed them the bug and they just stood there staring back at us. Then the waiter brought over another waiter to examine and they both stood there as if they were unsure of what they are looking at and walked away. Even if you aren't sure, good customer service is to try to correct your mistake. Not that we wanted it but to offer to make my mom a new one or take it off our bill would be the right thing to do! It's the thought that counts instead of standing there gawking at us and not doing anything. It just ruined the meal. Even with the terrible service, we still decided to give the 15% standard tip, which I believe they definitely did not deserve. I know how hard it is for waiters to earn money but still their behavior was unacceptable.   Food was less than great here but still it didn't warrant a one star rating until my mom found that bug in her food. If there was better customer service to fix the situation than that would have helped but the service here is inexcusable. They need to clean their vegetables better. If my mom found this, I wonder how many other things they have done that were unsanitary that went unnoticed. AGAIN I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE. I don't understand how it got such a high rating.",

There's so much selection, that I'll definitely be going back and back again to try them all!   Salmon and Tuna Sashimi: One word. FRESH! Presentation is on point too.  Kara Age: fried chicken here is delicious! Cooked perfectly.  White fish tempura: Japanese friend of mine recommended it to me. If I was by myself I would have never ordered it. So good, the fish is so light and fluffy. My favorite so far.  Beef carpaccio: it is slightly cooked, not entirely raw. This too is delicious, the slight crunch gives it so much texture that you have to have more.  Enoki with butter: another dish that was recommended to me by my friend. And am glad I tried it. I've never had enoki before, it does have the mushroom consistency we all know, but it is a bit chewier than I expected. The richness of the butter and the chewiness of the enoki go hand in hand.  Yaki Soba: by the time the dish came I was so full from all the rest! The noodles were cooked great, and has nice flavors.  Black sesame mochi: I've never had black sesame flavored mochi before and had to try. It was delicious! It was sweet with little sesame seeds inside. I loved it.  Presentation: all the foods are pretty to look at. The beef carpaccio looked like a work of art! The chef makes sure it looks good, as well as taste good.  Service: service is excellent. If one of my waitresses was busy with someone, another waitress made sure we were ok. Drinks were constantly refilled, and our waitress' sometimes stayed and chit chatted.   Chef: I spoke with the owner and he said their chef has 10 years experience in Kyoto! This food here is as authentic as they come!",

I had the 3 fish sashimi platter...couldn't go wrong with tuna, salmon & yellow tail. The salmon skin hand roll did disappoint, b/c I'm used to some salmon on my crispy warm skin even in a no-carb hand roll. This was straight up super crisp falling apart salmon skin only. Maybe just not the style I was accustomed to, but now I know! Good service and would love to try the big party table in the center with floor seating like in Japan!! Looks like it would be a cool experience. Next time",

Sadly, we ordered items that we weren't to our liking...the only dish we really enjoyed was the poke, takoyaki, and the chicken skin yakitori.  What wasn't didn't taste great were the uni dumplings (a weird paste filling), and pretty much all the yakitori.  All the yakitori needed salt, and all needed a bit more char.   The menu is huge, so maybe we ordered the wrong things, I'd like to think if we gave it another shot, it might be better.  In the end, for 4 of us with 2 pitchers, the bill was $250.00, definitely pricey for what we ate.",

The food was AMAZING. [See pictures] I definitely want to come back with some friends. Oh and the prices are well worth it.",

    "text": "WOW! Talk about food-gasms! Tucked away in the far left corner of chinatown, this restaurant is a hidden gem among the many asian establishments on Spring Mountain Road. It seems like they have everything here in terms of Japanese cuisine! What initially attracted me to this restaurant is that their menu is very unique. I can promise you that you won't find many of the dishes here at other establishments. Prices are affordable and realistically reflect the quality/quantity of food that you are getting. I love the authentic atmosphere of the restaurant. It feels almost like you just walked into a restaurant in Japan! The entire staff are very courteous and polite which only adds to the restaurant's ambience. I must have seen the waiters/chefs bow their heads seven or eight times to other guests throughout my entire meal. I also love how they have a large dining area in the center of the restaurant where there are no chairs available and guests dine by kneeling on cushions laid on the floor (just like in Japan!). My brother and I were feeling adventurous tonight so these are what we ordered: 1. Sea urchin dumpling: Fish cake with some sea urchin on top, wrapped into a dumpling; steamed. Creamy. Tastes great with their signature soy sauce. My only complaint with this dish, of course, is: it could use more sea urchin. 2. Chutoro: Simply fresh & delicious. A bit fatty but much leaner than otoro.  3. Ocean trout sashimi: Reminds me of salmon, tastes like salmon...but it is not salmon.  4. Ankimo Ponzu (steamed monkfish liver with ponzu sauce): Light, creamy, a bit salty. Not as earthy as you'd expect from your regular liver.  5. Beef Tataki (beef sashimi with ponzu sauce): This dish was a bit disappointing because we were expecting raw beef but instead we got over-seared meat. Still good, but could be better. Make sure you let your server know that you're expecting sashimi style. 6. Tako Wasa (raw octopus marinated with wasabi): This dish surprised me! The spiciness of the wasabi really enhanced the flavor of the octopus. It is not as slimy as I expected (which is only a good thing).  7. Sea urchin sashimi on wooden tray: Don't let the picture fool you, there's not THAT much sea urchin because the sea urchin are thinly sliced. It is definitely the go-to dish if you need a little sea urchin fix. Sweet & creamy in flavor. 8. Vanilla ice cream: We got it for free by checking in to Facebook.  Definitely the best vanilla ice cream that I've ever had. No joke. Rich & creamy, reminds me of Haagen Dazs ice cream, except much... much better.",

Alas our table for 2 was called, and we were stoked cuz we were both starved!  10 min after ordering one of the servers came back to our table (that seated us), and said I responded to the wrong name.  I'm like \"Dude, I wouldn't respond to a name thats not mine...\" so than he switched it up, and said oh well I made a mistake, I have to move you....  I'm like Okaaaay, I need a table. He's like we only have the bar. Wouldn't have waited 20min for the flippin table to end up at the bar; the bar seats were open from the beginning.  All you have to do is apologize and comp drinks or something.  Last I checked, this is F&B, its only customary..... My average check in there is $75, so there lack of empathy, no apology, means I'll take my biz elsewhere.",

We shared tempura, salmon and chicken lunch combinations, and while nothing wowed us, the service and promising looking dinner menu made us want to come back right away to check out dinner. Our first time in for dinner we were eating light and just came in for a few items at the bar...nothing was bad, but nothing would bring us back. We were the only ones in the restaurant and service was inconsistent as they had just opened and were still preparing for the evening shift. Our server (and the small staff in general) was in the back of the house the vast majority of the time, but the specials board as well as a few menu items sounded too good for us not to return. On our third visit the service was horrible. Our server was new, had not been trained properly, and she didn't know anything about Japanese food or the products being used. We ordered several items and once again, we were not impressed by a single one. Not only that, a few dishes were rather bad.   Items that let us down: Spicy Tuna Bowl Uni dumplings Crispy Pork Belly Hamachi kama Battera Tuna Belly Steak Chawan Mushi Tororo Udon with grated mountain yam   Lunch certainly saved this from a 1 star review in my opinion...but I would not have gone out of my way to eat lunch here aside from the bad dinner experiences. I've heard that they have improved recently, but I will have to hear that for a while from some trusted sources before I want to venture back.",

Or even if you're coming for the food.   If you know what izakaya defines. (is a type of informal Japanese drinking establishment that serves food to accompany the drinks. They are casual places for after-work drinking.) -Wikipedia.  It comes off a really authentic feel with a bit of island music ambiance lol.   The owner Go offers the typical sushi you could be looking for. Down to the creativity he offers of japanese tapas. They also offer a pretty good happy hour, if you're looking for a cheap beer and sake. I come about once or twice a week. And he knows what I like to get and offers the the fishes of the day. Cause I LOVE sashimi. His fried baby octopus is one of my favorites also.   If you come after 10 the have skewer happy hour. Which comes with my favorite beef tongue skewers . I love the tuna belly cutlet. Beef tataki. And etc. Try new things on this specials menu if you're up for it :) happy eating !",

We ordered the sashimi platter, the Hokkaido scallop sashimi, beef tataki, and the shoyu ramen.   Their sashimi pieces are tiny; They're a little over the size of a quarter. The tuna wasn't very fresh and the scallop sashimi looked like they took one scallop and cut it into slices to make it look like there was more than it really was.   The beef tataki was small too, and their dressing is so sour, which offsets the flavor of the beef.  The ramen was delicious, however, so that was their redeeming factor.   3 stars for the ramen and excellent service, but I left the restaurant still hungry.",

The menu is truly Japanese, though there are a few dishes added for the American audience (when in Rome). The ambience is right out of Japan with perfect izakaya decor. Even the draft beer is done using a Japanese style beer dispenser, which chills the beer as it's being dispensed and leaves the keg at room temperature. It also has a \"horigotatsu,\" a traditional Japanese table that is on the floor but which has a well underneath for your legs.   I can't recommend this place enough. Go to Go!!!",

The omakase 4 item dish was good value with Japanese shrimp and toro and wayugu beef but it still was not great...then had the uni with egg and that was fantastic!!! Ended with grilled squid which was served mildly cold...it was soft and tender but not outstanding. So maybe my standards are high from eating in LA so much but this definitely did not live up to the hype or rating on yelp. 3.5 stars overall...cannot say I will come back unfortunately!!",

    "text": "Went back to Izakaya Go Thurs. night (Dec. 20) after a looooong day waiting for our new range to get installed at the house. Luckily we found one of only a handful of non-30 min. max spots this time. Restaurant wasn't as full as the last visit, so we were able to get a table. Of course had to order the clams in garlic/butter broth. However, this time, it wasn't as \"holy crap this is awesome\" as the last time, but still gosh darn good (4/5). Husband got the teriyaki chicken dinner and said it was good, but not great. His favorite, so far, in Vegas is Sushi Takashi's version. But he still rated it 4/5. Our favorite order, by far, was the crispy pork belly. As close to meat candy as possible, without actually being sweet. Little pieces of perfectly seasoned pork belly, then fried, and served with a sprinkle of salt. When we squeezed some fresh lemon juice on it, it was deeeeee-licious. Small crunchy porky bits, kissed by some salt and with the freshness of the lemon juice (BTW, the lemon juice didn't make the pieces soggy at all - just make sure to use a light hand).   Can't remember the other things we got, as we were starving when we got there and inhaled quite a few of the grilled skewers, but I do know they were goooood. Can't wait to go back and try yet more stuff!",

I wish they opened for lunch though. But I do like the fact they open late night.   Everything looked good, so we ordered a lot of food! My eyes were bigger than my belly. We ordered (pictured): sizzling sauteed corn, pork belly skewer, beef tongue skewer, tempura, California rolls, beef tataki, cold soba noodles, deep fried octopus, buttered enoki mushrooms, ramen, miso eggplant, and edamame. My favorites were the sizzling sauteed corn, buttered enoki mushrooms, beef tataki, and miso eggplants (soo good!). Will definitely come back and try other dishes! I highly recommend checking out this place.",

We got to sit on cushions on the floor and even took off our shoes which was an interesting experience lol.   I ordered the Tonkatsu dinner plate which came with a bunch of things like: tofu, 2 pieces of gyoza, rice, miso soup, potato salad, salad, and obviously the tonkatsu lol. The tonkatsu was really crispy and flavorful and it left me wanting more! The gyoza tasted different compared to other ones I have tried, but it was tasty for only having vegetables inside of it. One of my friends didn't like it because of a weird tangy taste. My least favorite component of the meal was the tofu because it just tasted like a bland, firm block lol.  There is also a check in deal for free ice cream so I definitely took advantage of that and got a scoop of green tea ice cream. It was a nice finishing touch a delicious meal (who doesn't love free dessert?!).  Overall, you guys should check this place out if you have a group of people looking for a lively place to have dinner. I only paid about $15-16 for a bunch of food which left me full afterwards. Considering that this is an izakaya, that is pretty good. I be back next time to try some other dishes!",

My friend saw that this place has good reviews so we tried it out, unfortunately they didn't have too many ramen options, but they did have a large variety of menu items (from ramen to udon to sushi to takoyaki). Of course I got my usual ramen order, the shoyu ramen, in honor of this national holiday, but it wasn't all that I had hoped it would be. The takoyaki was very good and they have a jelly-like soju that is awesome. I may have liked this place more if I had something else, but based off of the ramen it wasn't my favorite. You get free ice cream when you check in, which is great, but the green tea flavor had a strange taste so I would go with the vanilla instead. I would give it another chance, especially since it's the only place I know of with the jelly-like soju.",

My boyfriend and I always go here for happy hour, but their menu is pretty big and affordable regardless. Their spicy tuna is one of the best I've ever had, and that's our favorite roll in general but some other places manage not to make it anywhere near as good as Izakaya does. I've tried all of the ramens and like every single one of them too. The owner has been at the restaurant every single time we've been there. I respect that SO much from a business standpoint, AND he is really cool! There was a party the last time we went and the people had gotten a little rowdy, and not only were the servers and the owner totally accommodating and cool with it, they joined in on the fun all while maintaining the rest of the restaurant successfully and professionally. That balance is hard to do and again, I really respect it! It makes for such a positive atmosphere from many different angles. Overall even with that, the restaurant isn't crazy loud, it's totally reasonable where you can talk easily to one another and still enjoy the buzz of a busy restaurant.  Bottom line: the food is delicious, the happy hour deals are amazing, the atmosphere is fun, and the staff all around is fantastic. This is an absolute must-visit!",

They have clams, in a broth, that is amazing. We ordered about 14 items off the menu and it was all delicious. The portions are a nice size for tapas. The decor was very elegant. I enjoyed my experience at Izakaya Go.  Let's get Lil Soya in Izakaya Go!!",

We also got the ten zaru soba. The tempura was extraordinary! It was so crispy and even when dipped in the sauce had a perfect crunch when eaten! They were very accommodating and helped us get extra tororo (grated yam) for the ten zaru soba. Great service as well. Never had to ask for a refill or call them to get their attention. Excellent! Will be back when we come to Las Vegas next time!",

When we arrived, the initial response was \"I feel like we're back in Torrance.\"  I didn't know what to think or say, but once we all sat down and started with the beers, I knew it was going to be a nice evening!  Located off of the strip, this drinking spot looks like it attracts more locals than \"others.\"  This is fine with me since a $4 beer off the strip tastes better than a $12 beer on the strip - especially when you're buying!  Izakaya Go isn't a huge place, but it's not a hole-in-the-wall by any means.  Decorated nicely.  Music was a bit weird but after the third pitcher, the music started sounding all the same.  Food was better-than-good.  We had a few beginner sushi eaters with us and the Uni Shumai was a hit or miss.  Spicy Tuna Rolls, Yakitori, Kim Chee, Tako Yaki, Noodles .. I think we ordered plenty for all to share.  Beer kept coming and the conversation kept flowing.  For a while, you almost forgot that we were in Vegas.  Consensus agreed.  Food and drinks were good.  Service on point.  Plenty of parking.  Highly recommend.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "First review on my Yelp since my other account isn't usable anymore. So I thought to make my first one on a restaurant that I consider my favorite as of right now.   I have been dining at this restaurant for about 3 months now and I come at least once or twice every week with my best friend. The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm at home and the staff is very friendly. What makes me happy is that some of the staff remembers our faces and makes us feel so welcome whenever we come in.   As far as food goes it takes a while to look at all the menus they give you, but a handful of items are my favorite out of any Japanese restaurant in town.  Pork cheek with scallion: $6.25 and the dish I get the most. You get several of slices of meat for such a low price! Fatty, crunchy on the outside, and the lean parts are just as tasty.  Beef tongue skewer: $2.75. my favorite out of the skewer list they give you. Very juicy and they pack the meat onto one skewer.  Enoki butter: $4.95. Enoki mushrooms drowned in warm butter. They give you a lot for less than $5 and goes hand in hand with the items I listed above! Salmon/yellowtail sashimi: both less than $6 and they give you 5 pieces for each fish. Fresh fish and decent sizes.   Service, food, atmosphere, everything about this place is amazing and that's why it is my favorite restaurant in Vegas so far! Also, if you check in on Facebook you get a free scoop of ice cream! I still have yet to try a lot of things on the menu but I highly recommend everything above!",

Smaller venue compares to some others, but it gives you almost better service in a way because it's easier to manage.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  The robata items are flavorful.  The menus are very extensive... it's a bit overwhelming at times because they literally give you like 4 or 5 menus with daily specials, special seafood, menus after menus.  Most of the things I have there are good.  The only thing I am sad that they've taken off the menu was the white fish tempura.  I think it'a halibut they used and wrapped in shiso leaves with the light tempura batter... too bad it's no longer the menu.  Their ikamaru (grilled whole squid) is not my favorite item from there.  Seemed like they poached the squid first then grilled it..or something, the texture isn't as bouncy as it should be.. or maybe just frozen squid and thawed out.. something isn't that right.  But other items are all very solid.  I wouldn't go for sushi burrito there either...   Even with a few minor things I don't particularly like there, still my go to izakaya place and easy access in the complex.  Highly recommend this place.  The chicken wings, the chilean sea bass, the beef, hokkaido scallops are my favorite skewers there.    They do have one big tatami table for larger group party.",

    "text": "My first visit to this new spot in Chinatown felt like a quick trip back to Japan. First of all, the atmosphere of the place was exactly what I'm used to see in my hometown. With all the decorations and spot lights surrounding the entire restaurant, the first thing that popped in to my mind was this is what an real Izakaya should look like. While I was impressed of the decor, my next question was, will this place have the right quality food that matches the place. Oh yeah they did and honestly it exceeded my expectation. Sashimi (raw fish with no rice) no doubt was as fresh as it gets, fried chicken (karaage) and kimuchi tofu went so well with beer. Moved on to drinking sake, grilled black cod, king crab legs, sea urchin dumpling, and tuna belly steak was so yummy, I couldn't stop drinking..... I closed it out with their Shio ramen. Their chashu was tender and flavorful and the soup had a nice kick spice in it, and liked it for the fact that it was chicken broth instead of pork. Well recommended and am going back to this place very soon. Oh and the service was great too.",

We were both extremely impressed with the extensive menu and asked for recommendations from the wait staff.  We both had the tempura shrimp and veggies.  Since this was our first time, the chef brought us a few samples and they were wonderful and was a great prelude to the meal.  When our dinner came, the presentation was excellent, but  I was not ready for the fresh, delectable taste of the tempura.  I have never tasted anything so light and tender as this dish.  The choice of veggies was excellent and different.  Even sweet potato dipped in tempura batter and fried to perfection.  My friend also had the miso soup and he said it was the best he had ever eaten.  I am just salivating writing this and will definitely go back again and again.  You need to try this restaurant!!!!  If you are visiting Las Vegas, seek it out, and if you live there, make it one of your regulars!!!!  You won't be sorry!!!!",

I've never had salmon nigiri taste like that and gummy ever! they also forgot to bring my friends rice and when they brought out the checks separate, it was all wrong and some items were on the others.  They didn't bring our food together and they didn't bring all the checks together either. The service was not great. I'm willing to try it again though next time hopefully it'll be better ?",

    "text": "Izakaya Go is located in Chinatown; Valley View and Spring mountain. It is a great place for  an authentic Japanese tapas food experience. The place is small but trendy. You have a good view of the kitchen where you can see the chefs working.   The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters, sushi burritos and traditional dishes. All the food we ordered were exquisite. I have to say the Ramen burger was different and something we never had before and was very delicious. It had a fried egg and a large piece of pork cooked to tender with large portion of seasoned fries that taste like sweet potato goodness. A standout for me was the fresh octopus ball.  It came in six and they had a nice flavor and as you chew it had different textures. The Poki \"Burrito\" was fresh as well. The portion is bigger then a typical sushi rolls, and instead of tortilla a sheet of nori seaweed with rice help contained all the ingredients. Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab served with ponzu sauce was fresh and crispy with a light batter and so was the fried baby octopus. You also get  a cup of complementary green tea in the end.  The seafood were fresh and flown in from Japan. They have a wide selection of sake. However, they did not carry Kurosawa which is one of our favorite but did get an equivalent kind called Kikusui Junmai Ginjo. The servers were welcoming and attentive.  The only thing I would advise is the music, they were playing Reggae when we were there. I would suggest to make it authentic is to play Japanese music. I would recommend this place and would definitely return and try something new.",

    "text": "On our first GO, we were a little let down by their menu selection. Did we come too early in their grand opening? Did they not expand their menu yet? Maybe the classic \"it's not you, it's me\" situation, but we just weren't really feeling it! Nothing looked truly original or even exciting, except for an item or two.  We felt that the small tapas style plates were leaning closer towards the pricey range. However, we did find a glimmer of satisfaction in 2 of the dishes we sampled. Here's what we ended up with:  Spicy tuna cracker $6.75 / From the appetizer section. Alright, so you heard me, this isn't original and I can definitely get a great spicy tuna cracker down the street (Gyu-Kaku, Jinya Ramen Bar) but it's still a pretty darn tasty execution of a classic, cult favorite dish. Beautifully presented; fried crispy rice, topped with spicy tuna, avocado, a dot of sriracha, and drizzled with a creamy spicy mayo sauce. Nice proportions  and we enjoyed the delicate, subtle spice. Flavor rating: 5/5  Asparagus bacon $4.95 / From their stir-fried section. It came out in a bowl, super limp and soggy, with about 2 inches of oil at the bottom. We felt that it was also way too salty for its own good, so we ordered an extra side of rice to eat it with. Granted, bacon is supposed to be salty - it was overkill. And what's up with that pool of oil? Flavor rating: 2/5  Uni chawan mushi $6.25 / From the steamed dishes section. This, to us, is an exotic find; we haven't seen it at most restaurants. Also, we can't compare this dish to anywhere else as it's our first time trying it, yet we thought it was exceptionally bland (I apologize in advance if this dish is supposed to be flavored in that manner.) As gorgeous as it was, with the elegant presentation, it wasn't our favorite dish of the evening. The uni flavor was terribly muted and that is a shame. Flavor rating: 2/5  Fresh halibut roll $10.95 / From the sushi rolls section. California roll topped with fluke sashimi, yuzu juice, and natural salt. Extremely simple, however, the fish was very fresh, naturally sweet, and we loved the brightness that the yuzu offered. The surprising sprinkles of salt set off our taste-buds in a explosive direction and we really enjoyed that. Flavor rating: 4/5  We would be curious to return (eventually) to taste their other specials such as the \"uni dumplings\" or try other popular dishes that our Yelper buddies rave about.  You may find them on a better night than we did - but for the variety seeker, the Izakaya connoisseur, this spot might be a NO-GO.",

The wait line isn't long usually but it's very much worth it if you do have to wait.  We got their fish and chips, octopus fried rice, salmon bowl, tuna belly skewer, fries, unagi bowl and the spicy salmon hand roll.  Everythig we ordered was really good, their rice bowls come with a tofu miso soup with seaweed inside.  Everyone enjoyed their food a lot.  The only thing I would really say is that after you order your food, the wait for your food is a bit longer than usual. But eventually the food comes and it's really good. So I do recommend going there to try out there food whether it's happy hour or not. It's really good.",

Items ordered:  Salmon skin salad Battera Unagi bowl Hamachi kama Takoyaki Agedashi tofu Chicken KaraAge Chawan Mushi Ten zaru soba Tororo Udon Mushroom Zosui Tuna Belly Steak  A standout was the octopus ball.   There were six and they had good flavor and different textures.  The agedashi tofu was good.  The broth was very flavorful. The mushroom porridge was OK but we hadn't yet gotten sharing bowls so we each had some in our small soy sauce saucer.  The udon was also OK.  The mushroom porridge was my favorite dish.  Major fails:  tuna belly steak - overcooked and very dry.  The tempura was not good.  It had not been cooked enough and the batter had an unfinished taste.  The soba noodles were not good and had little flavor.  I was very disappointed in the chawan mushi.  I don't understand why they charge $2.50 for iced green tea but hot green tea is free.  The place is very small.  Maximum capacity sign said 70 and that would be pushing it.  The noise level was high.    There are other izakaya restaurants superior to this.",

We always go to this place and order my fave takoyaki, tonkotsu ramen, tuna skewers, rolls, and tuna steak. Today we didn't even want to order from Happy Hour (like the half ramen) but that's what they gave us after ordering the full one. But we're not the type to complain so we just tried ordering other dishes. Just sad because the service was really slow. Our water didn't even get refilled either. We don't blame the people for slow service, but please consider hiring more people or maybe make the space not too over crowded that way service can be faster and orders are not being cancelled. Sad to say, we had to cancel the rest of our orders because we had to wait for so long everytime we want to make a new one. I'd like to acknowledge our male server tho for trying his best. Anyhow, food's great, but we may just go somewhere else.",

    "text": "So the chef/owner opened this establishment after his successes in Los Angeels with Hondaya Izakaya, and a bunch of other Hondaya restaurants. I've had the Izakaya in L.A., and several people I know are fans as well.   What I ate:   Steamed clams in garlic soup/sauce- 5 star. SOOOOOOO GOOD. I don't even like clams very much and LOVED this dish. The clams were cooked to perfection, and the garlic soupy broth just makes this dish stellar. I think I could eat 5 bowls of this.   Yakisoba - 5 star.  I've had so many different Yakisoba's in Japan. This one was very good. Unlike most places, it had a ton of veggies, and a couple pieces of really yummy pork. MAKE SURE YOU GET IT WITH PORK, not chicken or beef.   Fried octopus- 5 star. Everyone at the table loved this dish. It's crispy and delicious.   Chicken porridge (chicken zosui)- 3  star. This was good, but I have had better before. The broth could have been a bit more flavorful.   Spicy miso ramen- 3 star.  It was good, not extraordinary. The spice level if average, and the miso flavor is a bit weak. But hey, this ain't no ramen place.   Halibut carpaccio with uni on top- 3 star. I thought this was an OK. Some other people liked it so, it could be a personal preference.   Salted chicken wings- 3 star.  The chicken was a bit hard on the inside, slightly over cooked. I loved the outside flavoring. Make sure to sprinkle some SICHIMI (Japanese red pepper) on it, and it will be a game changer.   Miso salmon sashimi- 2 star.  I wasn't particularly fond of the flavor of the miso.  Spicy tuna on crispy rice- 1 star. I personally did not like the flavor of the spicy tuna at all.   Service- 5 stars.  I'd come back here to try more items, as the menu is extensive. The service was on point, and it's a nice place to come with a small group of people (up to 4).  There's only one table that I saw that can seat a larger group.  Portions are small for the appetizers/tapas, so if sharing, maybe 4 people can get a bite at most.",

    "text": "I've got izakaya fever and the only cure is... more Japanese tapas! Heads up that the lunch menu is more casual fusion fare (sushi burritos, for example) while the dinner menu is mostly traditional dishes, with a great board of specials- handily posted over each table for your drooling convenience.  As staples, I'd order the UNI CHAWAN MUSHI ($7)- delicate egg custard dish with uni and mushrooms, served in the cutest French china pot, which was second only to a phenomenal MUSHROOM PORRIDGE with egg (back page of menu by the rice bowls)- it's saucy and carby and comforting and flavorful all at once.  Not to mention packed with mushrooms.   Other favorite dishes include the CRISPY TUNA CRACKER, which manages to be both spicy and crispy without being too spicy or too crispy. The TEMPURA WHITE FISH ($6) is divine- I'd order several for the table, the flavorful, flakey fish goes fast. If it's on the specials menu, I'd consider the TUNA BELLY STEAK ($12) a must-order; the dipping sauce and perfectly-cooked interior make for an orgasmic bite.  I did not originally plan on ordering sushi here, but was easily persuaded to try their sashimi specials- and the freshness of their fish rivals the top-ranked places in town. I also really enjoyed some of their simpler rolls, like the salmon and avocado- that section of the menu isn't too large and consists mostly of classic combinations.  Heads up that orders may take a while if there are several large groups- it's a small place with a small kitchen. I would like to suggest that they NOT use the first table inside the door for groups, as squeezing my butt past someone's face is NOT my idea of a good start to my meal- nor one I would want to experience.",

    "text": "2015 is undoubtedly gonna be the year of Battle Izakaya (Las Vegas edition).  But seriously, the quality and execution of the dinner items I tried overall was superior to that other established Izakaya restaurant down the street.  The price point is also more consumer friendly.  The lunch menu was okay. But I didn't get to try the ramen noodles, which from the pictures look like they too are on point.   The Ramen Burger that I ordered was a bit of a mess to eat, but I managed to keep my hands clean by donning a pair of latex gloves. However, the big pieces of raw green onions should be grilled or left out entirely. The fried egg with the runny yolk center enhanced the burger. The seasoned fries was pretty good, but I normally skip the fries (I try to save those calories for other stuff like matcha cheesecake or Thai Iced Tea).  The Poki \"Burrito\" was decent. The portion is bigger then your typical sushi rolls, and instead of tortilla a sheet of nori seaweed with rice help contained all the ingredients in an easy & no mess format ideal for on the go consumption.  Their GO Curry menu is good too. I ordered it with Pork Cutlet, and the curry was good but with maybe just a 1 on the spiciness scale.  I have not asked, if there is an option to make it spicier for those that are into the burning mouth game.  For dinner, we ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Plate, which I thought was a great value and was delicious. My fav Asian friend gave her thumbs up approval.  In spite of initial hesitation, she also enjoyed the Grilled Miso Marinated Alaskan Black Cod.   The Chicken Kara-Age was decent, as well as the Geso (Baby Octopus) Tempura. But the star of the evening was the Uni Chawan Mushi. Seriously good.  Service was good, especially considering that they have just barely opened.  But I have not been there yet when the restaurant was packed and the servers are truly tested.  Overall,4.5 stars!",

    "text": "I just checked out Izakaya Go after seeing some great reviews on Yelp. I love Ichiza even though it gets a bad rep: totally understandable. I figure this new place would be modern, clean, and familiar.  I've gone through the yelp photos many times so I new exactly what I wanted.  I came Thursday night at 12:30am. It was EMPTY. I was so happy. We were greeted promptly and basically had the entire staff to ourselves. The seating is cute with butt cushions that I really liked lol  I recently cut out meat as much as possible so I had a pretty vegetarian friendly meal with a friend.  We got French fries, oysters, cucumber roll, crispy rice, agedashi tofu, mushroom porridge, and the uni custard.  I have to say our meal was delicious. We just wanted something light but left ridiculously full. Everything came out prompt, hot, the presentation was nice, and everything was cooked well. I enjoyed all of the above listed items. My one criticism is the dishes all seemed to be missing one little element that could make the food even better.   Maybe some fish eggs to top the uni custard? Maybe something crunchy to top the mushroom porridge? Maybe a house made aioli for the fries?  Although small in size, the oysters were probably my favorite dish. They were fresh and seasoned so well with lemon and ponzu.   I also really loved the uni custard. The texture was almost like silken tofu but it tasted so good! There was some shrimp in there and some other goodies.   I really Enjoyed my self as did my friend. We both left super full from for a total of $40. I can't wait to come back to get some more of the delicious oysters, super comforting mushroom porridge, and that special uni custard.  Maybe it's because we had the place to ourselves, maybe it was because our servers only waited on us, or maybe we just got lucky. I hope to try the sushi burritos and ramen burger soon.  The free hot tea was nice.  I hope they add more desserts to their menu.",

Tako wasa here is a great beer companion. It's relatively cheaper than prices in LA so was thoroughly happy to try a bunch of things with our big party and still not have to fork over a pretty penny.",

Small but very cozy restaurant atmosphere, and they had chill reggae music playing the whole time. Food was *delicious*...pork belly was the best, chicken hearts and beef tongue were juicy, ramen was SO GOOD, takoyaki was actually cooked properly (most places tend to mess it up by over or undercooking it), and my party regrets not ordering more of the salmon. When my friends and I come back to Vegas, this will be a place to revisit!",

Again with a group you really just order a whole bunch and just share, and that's what we did. The food came out one right after the other which was great because it allowed us time to conversare and enjoy each bite. The ramen was so comforting on that cold night. You can never go wrong with Raman, it warmed up my whole body. The takoyaki balls were crunchy and piping hot so watch your mouth!!! It was like a burst of warm flavors oozing all in your mouth!!! So good!! The ribs and mussels we just as delicious! I would definitely love to come back here and try more! I feel like you could never get enough here, there's so many different flavors and textures to play with. Always another surprise!",

    "text": "We've been meaning to try Izakaya Go but usually just end up at Ichiza. I took my parents here when they were in town and it was a pleasant experience. It's a very small restaurant and we waited about 10-15 min for a table on a Friday night. We started off with mugi shochu (a Japanese alcohol made from barley.) I can't find anywhere in town that sells it except a few restaurants so I always try to take advantage. Ask for it on the rocks it's very mild but similar to vodka or sake.  We ordered a bunch of little plates to share:  Okonomiyaki: seafood pancake. It's usually a lot thinner than it was served here but everyone agreed the texture was perfect. It was spongy and had a great ratio of batter to filling. A little heavy on the sauce but still good. A good portion size too for sharing.  Karaage: standard fried chicken but served with mayonnaise, interestingly. The seasoning was a lot heavier than I've ever had it but it was great.   Kimchi tofu: one of the highlights. The flavor was amazing. It was served in a bed of broth with tempura crunchies inside. The mix of textures and the sour kimchi was perfection.  Shoga yaki: I've never had this before but loved it. It's stir fried pork with ginger. If I wasn't very hungry I would have just ordered this with a side of rice.  Tsukemono: I love tsukemono (Japanese pickled vegetables) And the waiter was impressed we actually ordered it. It's a great palate cleanser and very refreshing.  Hamachi Kama: Always a must have at izakayas. It's yellow tail collar. Mix in the daikon with the soy broth. You can pick at the collar for a long time and still get some good meat.  Yakisoba: Probably wouldn't order this again. Very similar to the shoga yaki with the vegetables used and felt a little heavy at this point in the meal.   Crunch roll: standard crunch roll. Small order though so it wasn't too filling.   Overall I liked Izakaya Go. Their menu isn't as adventurous as Ichiza but it has all the right stuff. I could definitely come back for some shochu and skewers. The night we went they were out of a lot of the skewers we wanted to try so we skipped that. It's also very close to the Strip compared to the rest of Chinatown so I'd recommend for tourists staying at the Wynn or somewhere nearby.",

I needed a place to go that was open late and had fair reviews, and with an average 4.5 stars and closing time at 3am, this was the place  After work, my girlfriend and I got here at 1:30am. It was not as busy, even for a Saturday night. Normally little spots like these in Chinatown are POPPIN at this hour on a weekend. We didn't know what to expect, but we were blown away by the speedy service and quality of our food. Our server Travis was on top of everything; whether it was clearing our plates or bringing us our food. The chefs deserve a shout-out as well, as they made everything amazing. We ordered a lot of happy hour menu items ( happy hour starts at 10 and ends at closing ) such as the half-order of Shoyu ramen, pork dumplings, fish n chips, and spicy tuna rolls. We ordered a few skewers as well; shitake mushroom, bacon wrapped quail egg, fried chicken hearts, and even a poached egg. The only thing we got that wasn't off of a specialty menu was a full order of the Nabeyaki udon ramen.  We got so much more than we expected, and we can only thank Izayaki Go for bringing it to us. If you're craving ramen or even Japanese tapas, this is the spot. Another shout out to Travis for being on top of things AND bringing the house chili sauce (;",

    "text": "Izakaya Go was a no for me with their Shoyu Ramen. I will explain in a bit.   My sister suggested that we try out the place so I went with her. First off, the ambiance was very casual and this place has some points for some of its aesthetic decorations. Service was very prompt and great. We were quickly asked if my sister and I have been served and brought out waters.   They have a Happy Hour menu starting at 10pm- closing. I wasn't really in the mood to try much this night so this may be a disadvantage in the review for everything else. But after experiencing many other ramen places, I would not go here for ramen if that's what you're looking for.   Their Shoyu ramen is made with egg noodle and come with bamboo as the topping and a half cooked egg. As in my photo, you could tell that it was lacking variety. The broth was very flat and one dimensional.   I forgot what the dessert was called, but it was made with green tea pancake sandwich with red beans and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If you like green tea unsweetened than you'll enjoy the green tea bitter after taste. I took a scoop of the red beans and vanilla ice cream with the green tea pancake and you get an un-orchestrated concoction of taste. The vanilla ice cream over powered everything.   On a side note I was told to try their tuna dishes and poke salad, so I may come back next time with a bigger appetite to try other things on the menu.   IMHO I would rather go to Ichiza... But I'm willing to give this place a try again some other time.",

    "text": "About a year ago I really wanted a sushi roll but all the restaurants near me that serve sushi were closed.  So my husband and I decided to try this place and we've been going there steadily ever since.  They seem to be open from about 5p-3a and the food there is always great.  I love their plum wine too!  I like to get shiitake mushrooms, Philadelphia rolls, and their steak curry with rice.  I have tried a bunch of other items on the menu though and everything has always tasted great.  I've even brought out of town guests there and they've really enjoyed it too!  Everyone there is super friendly and very attentive without you feeling like you have to make a decision right away.... you can feel free to take your time to make a decision and there's no rush.    I highly recommend this place!",

Because I lived in japan for 18 years, I'm a little picky when it comes to Japanese food. This place had a fun and authentic atmosphere and the food was great! So glad I was able to get a little piece of home during our mini vacay to Vegas.   Some highlights were the fried soft shell crab, shoga yaki (ginger pork), and tako yaki. Loved the free green tea ice cream that I got for checking in on yelp!",

I was still looking for some hot soup, the tok kosh spicy ramen was more than satisfying! One of the best ramen I have had in Vegas, the broth was not so salty and the noodles were very fresh, great flavor.   We also got some skewers to try, my personal favorite was the shiitake mushrooms!  The server did a good job selling the catch of the day menu, we got the barracuda I believe.. the sashimi fish was incredibly fresh, cheaper than most American sea food restaurants too.  The dessert was the cheese cake with yazu? Server said the cheese cake is made in house, it was fresh and delicious and just the right amount of sweetness.  This place was a lucky find..would definitely come back again",

Ordered some Yakitori particularly the pork belly, tuna, and beef.  Everything was great, but the beef was not on par.   The Takoyaki was good, miso soup was standard, and the yakisoba I personally didn't like, but only because I like my noodles on the softer side, the flavor was good though.    Had the house sake hot, and it was excellent for the price.  They also had a deal where you get free ice cream with a yelp check in, so no complaints here.",

My friends have been raving about this place, so I finally tried it with them and I gotta be honest and say that my experience was mediocre. The food was alright, but the customer service would probably be 2 out of 5 stars. So, for my first time, only 3 stars at best.  The happy hour for food and drinks are pretty generous - lots of variety for it just being a happy hour menu. We got the half ramen, curry rice w/ added chicken cutlet, pork dumplings, California roll, and the seasoned french fries. The half ramen, for the happy hour price of $5, was awesome. I'd come back and get this again. The curry rice + chicken cutlet was decent - they got the flavor right, which IMO is most important, but the serving size is tiny (even with the HH prices, there's an additional cost to add the chicken so I expected a bit more). Everything else we ordered was okay, no complaints.  The customer service needs some work. It was a Friday night, and unexpectedly not as busy relative to other places in Chinatown, yet our server took 15 mins to take our waters, then 20 mins for our actual orders. She also ended up messing up our orders (giving us someone else's order so we had to wait more to get our actual order), and giving me back a different credit card back... not a good first impression.  Overall, a decent experience. I'd come back again for the food and drinks.",

From chicken gizzard, chicken heart skewers, spicy chicken wings skewer, chicken cartilage skewer.  sashimi salad, baked mussels and fried pork belly. They're grilled nicely. All were juicy and had a nice char to them. Right amount of hinted of salt and lemon to accompany their natural flavor.  The Raman shoyu broth was clear and clean. Raman perfectly cooked. Bold flavored and the meat was tender and juicy.   Customer service was friendly, nice and efficient. It's a small place but they really get you in and they don't short you on service or quality of their food either.   This is definitely a new go to spot when I visit.",

Upon entering, you are instantly sent to a busy little hole in the wall Japanese local hot spot. Servers are super friendly (although ours was a little less knowledgeable about the sake/wine menu).  The menu: There are a lot of items (and a lot of menus! We were given 3: specials, main menu, drinks, and a tally sheet for smaller dishes), so it can be a bit overwhelming. It would definitely suggest ordering some items off the tally sheet! They are small, taster dishes so you can try a little bit of everything!  The food: Delicious and perfectly timed. We had the cracker roll appetizer, crab brain shiso tempura, spicy beef yakisoba (bf and I split), new zealand lamb skewer, bacon wrapped quail egg skewer, beef tongue skewer and tuna belly hand rolls. It was all SO good, I officially cannot pick my favorite. I will be returning for sure!",

    "text": "Izakaya Go is undoubtedly my most favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas. I come here all the time after a draining day of work to unwind and enjoy all the delightful tapas. It's almost to the point where you can find me either working, sleeping at home or eating at Izakaya Go. After +20 visits here, I felt that I should list some of my favorites for those that never visited, or for people who are looking for something new to try here.   Since I come here late at night, I like to order from their Happy Hour Special (10PM to close every night!). California Poke Roll is my favorite out of all. Half-size but for $3.50, portion is generous and it is delicious.   Fishes they use are uber fresh. If you follow them on Instagram or Facebook, you will know that this place gets fresh fish from all parts of the world. For that reason, I recommend their sushi and sashimi. My personal favorites are salmon sashimi, fresh halibut roll, salmon avocado roll and Philadelphia roll.   Curry is surprisingly good here too. Just like Zen Curry, you can add toppings to it and also adjust the spice level. I would say that curry here is better than Zen curry. Generous portion, reasonable price (cheaper) and delish!   If you are starving and can't decide what to eat, go to the back of the menu for their combination plates. You choose your main dish and it comes with small dishes on the side, rice, miso soup and salad. My personal favorites are their karaage and tempura. My friends enjoy their katsu and salmon (specifically the salt flavored).   In addition, their special menu has all the good stuff! Baked mussel is my current favorite right now. Must order! Their uni pasta is another good dish-creamy and rich uni flavor. I also enjoy their pork kimchi with jidori egg. Pork cooked with kimchi and poached egg on top. Kimchi adds a little kick to it and this alone with a side of rice is enough for me sometimes.   Support your local business! Top-notch food, attentive/friendly service and a restaurant that makes you feel at home. What's not to love about that? !",

We came in around 9pm on a Saturday night, the place was pretty full but not crazy packed, we did not have to wait or anything. We were greeted immediately and quickly seated, our server brought out water while we looked through the menu.   We wanted to try a bunch of items on their specials menu but 90% of the items were not available...So...why did the hostess even give us the menu? Why didn't our server tell us that they are out of the specials before we spent the time choosing what we wanted?  We ended up getting pretty much the same items as before. Food was really good, don't get me wrong. But you should be stocked and prepared for the weekend crowd, I am not sure if they sold out for the day (we came in at 9 so not even that late) or they don't currently offer those dishes anymore.. regardless, either stock up for the weekend or don't offer the menu. It was disappointing after spending time choosing and getting excited about trying new and interesting items then being told literally all items you wanted are not available.  I definitely enjoy the food, some really good stand out items, just disappointed not being able to enjoy their specials.",

They have veggies, salads, proteins and grilled items.  This is located in Chinatown. We got seated right away and I noticed one of the Japanese diners who runs a Japanese restaurant in town.  Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab: Served with ponzu sauce. The batter was light. 4/5  Gindara: Grilled miso black cod. Light, mildly sweet, smokey fish that simply melts in your mouth. If you like simplistic dishes, this is for you. 5/5  Beef Tataki: Tender slices of beef sashimi served with ponzu sauce, salad and roasted garlic on top. 5/5  Sashimi Salad: Spring mix with hamachi, tuna, salmon, whitefish and shrimp with ponzu garlic dressing and spicy mayo. Perfectly dressed. Protein to greens ratio was just right. 4/5  Salmon Skin Salad: Greens, salmon skin, bonito flakes and yuzu dressing. They were generous with the salmon skin. The salmon skin looked super crispy but it was not quite the case. 4/5  Sea Urchin Dumpling: Out of the dishes we've tried, this one was the most disappointing. Steamed wonton with what seems to be egg inside with a bit of uni on top. The flavor and texture were weird. 1/5  Sea Urchin Sashimi on Wooden Tray: From Santa Barbara, CA, this tray of beauty and perfection is served with nori, wasabi and special soy sauce. Very fresh and buttery texture. 5/5  Uni Pasta: You may have had the same dish from a Japanese trattoria a few blocks away.  I think this version is better. Pasta in very creamy sauce, uni floating on top and nori shreds. 5/5  Ikamaru: Grilled squid served with Japanese mayo. Slightly chewy. 3.5/5  Grilled Tuna Belly Steak: It's nice to have a casual restaurant that serves this. I love this stuff. Flakey, tender and smokey fish that you dip in ponzu. 4.5/5  The prices aren't bad. Apps and entrees anywhere around $4-15. The service was very good. I think everything we've had so far have been delicious except for the uni dumpling.",

On top of that their music selection is perfect which really ties the atmosphere together. Most of the music that is played is dub reggae and lovers rock.

I have to say the Ramen burger was the bomb, it had a fried egg and a large piece of pork in there along with some well seasoned fries. Very tasty. The Halibut carpaccio with Uni was very pretty and presentation but not very tasty, the quality of fish was mediocre. The tomato and yam salad was very good, very unique in presentation and taste. Must order if you are an adventurous foodie.    The service was very nice, and drink filled regularly. The store manager also came often to check on us to make sure everything was good.",

At first we got divide into 2 tables but we saw a big table and we ask them if we could move there, one of the guy was nice to say it was ok.  We already ordered before we got moved so by the time we got all seated the foods were coming out.   We ordered in their HH menu, the portions are not bad, some of us ordered appetizers too. The food is good, the ambience is nice plus it's more fun eating with a big group of friends hahaha.   Oh, one of my friends told the server that we're celebrating my husband's bday which we are. It's suppose to be a surprise cuz the turn off all the light and sing to u while they bring a little dessert but someone else was celebrating their bday so my husband knows already what's gonna happen, but was still gun.  The only think I notice is when one of my friends ask if she could get an extra bowl they gave her a 2 small ones and when she ask if she could get the same size as the HH ramen bowl the lady server said to her that she already gave her one and wasn't very nice when she said that to our friend.   We might come back here but it depends if we're in Vegas again.....hahaha.....oh they open late that's why we went there.",

I went for their Happy Hour (10pm-close) and their prices are very reasonable and their portions are are generous. I would say Izakaya Go will be one of my top choices for whenever I go to Chinatown now.   I got the curry with braised pork belly and I thought the portions were going to be smaller due to happy hour prices, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. The curry arrived in a big plate, half rice and half curry with a small pork belly on top. The meat to rice ratio was 1:2 so I had a lot of rice left over, but that wasn't a problem for me. I ordered 2 pork belly skewers and I ate that with my rice and the curry is so delicious. The skewers were actually very tasty as well. We tried the mango and lychee cocktail and it was pretty strong in my opinion. Next time I go I want to try their hot pot or ramen.   The service was very nice. We didn't wait too long to be seated and we ordered right away when we sat down. The food arrived in the usual amount of time it takes to make.",

The server that served us, though lacking in energy a bit, provided us with a lot of time to decide and was caring. He made sure we were comfortable.  My friend ordered the ramen, which I thought was okay. I ordered the chazuke because I was craving umeboshi, rice, and different flavors. Very light, very distinct umami. The umeboshi was a nice addition to the dish: slightly pungent and very refreshing. We also had the otoro sashimi. I didn't get the melt in your mouth feeling I usually get, but it tasted pretty good.  Overall, nice dining experience, very comfortable and a nice addition to the Las Vegas scene.",

While I will avoid the sushi and sashimi in the future, I will definitely add this place to my rotation.  HOT DISHES Gindara (black cod) Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar) Spinach with garlic Asparagus with bacon Agedashi Tofu Onigiri (with bonito flakes)  Cold Dishes Halibut sashimi Tuna sashimi Mochi  I can't say how authentic the asparagus and spinach are, but I can say that they are seasoned well, greasy (in the best way), and delicious. The hamachi Kama was the standout dish of the meal. So often I've ordered this dish from other establishemnts and found the fish collar is overcooked, not properly crisped, or the piece of fish is naturally thin and lacking in enough fat or flavor. The collar here was thick and cooked very well. it's such a simple and comforting dish that I cannot help but base my impression largely on my experience with this piece of fish. I am always seeking a good piece of fish treated well.  We raved about our hot dishes, but the table was silent when we ate the sashimi. The tuna pieces were cut way too thick and there was chewy/difficult gristle in each piece that made for an unappetizing bite. Since the raw fish was only a small portion of our meal, it did not sully our experience.   In total, I had ZERO expectations when we walked in the door. And I left pleased with the service and each of the cooked dishes. I really like this place--its vibe, the hot dishes, and the location. While I hit some bumps in my meal, there is so much more on the menu I want to try. Based on my first experience, I am absolutely going to come back.",

Our server was attentive and patient, I don't remember her name but she was great.      Since I came late, they have a special discounted menu, which had some great deals. I ended up ordering a half Miso ramen for $5 and the truffle edamame for $4. I also tried my friend's order of the takoyaki. The ramen was well worth the money, and it came with pork, a piece of nori, and an half an egg. The edamame was buttery, and the flavor is subtle. The takoyaki was delicious, it's about 6 pieces for $6.      I would recommend this place if you aren't too hungry, and have a friend. It can get pretty expensive if you order too much. The traditional and fun Japanese atmosphere/theme makes for a good social spot.",

    "text": "Good just not great. This is my second time here since I'm a fan of the close location to the strip and relative proximity to the heart of Chinatown  We were seated within 5 mins and our terrible service began. I had to constantly wave her down throughout the night.   They are basically a neo American Japanese fusion place local influences of Mexican and Korean cuisine as well. It is quite well thought out and they have an amazing bar and selection of sake. My main complain is the portion size here is ridiculously small!! It is \"tapas\" style jap dishes almost and number of dishes such as their grilled fish does not even come with anything else like a bowl of rice or soup. All of us had to order basically 2 or even 3 items to get a decent meal. Overall decent but since there is so much competition close by, this is probably my last time here",

The beef yaki udon came out on a sizzling plate and was delicious but it had two pieces of beef in it (literally two). I was really excited for the Poke bowl but the ratio of poke to rice was way off. There was barely any of that delicious tuna in the bowl.",

The soba noodles look like ramen noodles in texture and color. It also didn't have the taste like regular soba. The service was also lacking. I did not get my order of the sea bream sashimi until everyone was finished eating! I had eaten here before and it was great! But last night the service was lacking in the timing of the dishes. I'm sorry Mr Go, but it was not a good experience last night.",

I was so suprised to find  a good Japanese restaurant in Vegas. The price was very cheap :)  I would come back in the future !",

Off the extensive menu we picked things to try.   2 of each dish that we shared.   The server recommened somethings to round out our eating experience.   I think we had maybe a dozen things to try......Everyone had there favorites..... Mine was the \"deep fried baby octopus\".... It  made your standard calamares seem so regular. Service was excellent we never felt rushed and the food came out one dish at a time.   We also left with full  tummys !! When all the eating was done,  the only thing we complained about was the bill.    We thought it was not enough..... Thank you Go.....we will be back !!",

Very difficult to get served & no assistance from the staff at all. Love the large mugs of cold Japanese beer. I ordered a \"special fish flown in from Japan\"(sea bream) sashimi style. After the strange looks from my server, it took over 25 minutes for it come out. Actually all the dishes took 15 minutes minimum. The overrated sea urchin dumplings were sticky, overcooked and boring. I ordered 3 different yakitori and got 2. Those 2 seemed like they were precooked and reheated on the grill. I stopped after the yakitori due to no service and just average food. There are more civilized options in Las Vegas.",

Fried pork belly...was fried pork belly. Would not go out of my way to visit again",
