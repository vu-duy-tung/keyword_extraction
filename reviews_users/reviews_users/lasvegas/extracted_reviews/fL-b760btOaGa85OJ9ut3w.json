We asked if we accidentally received 1/2 pound and the guy looked away and said no it's right ($15 catfish plate provides 3 pieces, no way on Earth 4 is a pound).

Today I finally had the opportunity to enjoy this heavenly BBQ. The ribs are melt in your mouth, the smoked meatloaf was better than any I have ever tasted! The only reason it didn't get five stars was due to the fact they have such limited hours. Service was good, location not so easy to get to, and the dining rooms acoustics weren't desirable especially when it became busy. I suggest getting there no later than 10:45 am after that a giant wave of hungry lunch patrons start coming through the door. I recommend this BBQ delight to everyone, the portions are definitely shareable.",

The dining area(s) are small, but from what I could tell, most people were carrying their food to go anyway. Oh, and don't expect to find it on the strip... do some exploring and you'll find this place a little out-of-the-way.  For a barbecue place, Rollin Smoke has a decent sized menu w/ some more odd options like the baked potato, or giant burgers not usually associated. Their sauce is really good with a nice kick, and spice that adds flavor to anything from ribs to their awesome fries.  Try the sides. I love how they add spice by-way-of jalapenos to macaroni, and beans.   Is it the best I've had? No, but its close.",

    "text": "This is the best BBQ I've ever had in Vegas and the food is a solid 5!   The 4 is actually a 4.5 (unfortunately Yelp doesn't offer that option) because I rate my dining experience on food, atmosphere and service. My few niggles to follow later.  If anyone is hesitant about the area,  don't be.  You can smell the smoky goodness down the block and it will draw you in like the crack den of BBQ that it is.  This is a family run hole in the wall and the plastic cutlery atmosphere suits it.  We sat in the mural covered back room, our first hint that the owners hailed from Arkansas.  We didn't even know that Arkansas \"did\" BBQ, my who knew concerning that state began and ended with the now Vegan Bill Clinton; little did I suspect that I would be in for a presidential Q.  We arrived around 3:00, as they close at 8:30 PM Monday-Thursday and made our way to the back room before we placed our order at the podium in the front room.  And here comes a niggle-most of the tables were not wiped down and nor would they be for some time after we arrived.  I don't mind lolling around in my own juicy, fat and Q juice runoff, but I'm not a fan of cleaning up someone else's.  Niggle two was a less than pristine bathroom.  I'm hoping that all this was due to the time of day, more than a recurrent daylong drawback.  We both ordered the $24.95 all you can eat, so we could sample a greater number of things and graze off of each other's plates.  We placed our order with John (one of the owners) I was trying to gauge the amount of food that we would be getting and he thought my beef rib order would be a bit too much, but I let him know I was a good little eater.  I may be short, but I do have some amazing chow down capacity.  We then prepared ourselves for a leisurely wait, eagerly sniffing in the smoke fumes.  There were only two diners in our room, and one of them decided to share his phone Gangsta Rap at mega-volume, I stopped sniffing at the air and unleashed a very annoyed and loud \"REALLY!?!?!\" but it wasn't until his food arrived (fortunately quickly) that this rude dipshit lowered his personal jukebox.  Then our meal arrived and the gluttonous food orgy began.  For sides we had the corn bread, fried onion straws, greens, corn nuggets-all contenders for a pure outstanding deliciousness award, some tasty curly fries and a ok roll.  For meats we had pulled pork, hot links, beef ribs, pork ribs, rib tips-all perfectly smoked and overwhelmingly delectable.  The chicken and brisket were good and the sauce was nicely spiced not too sweet. We ate till it hurt; leaving the final stretch of mass stomach expansion for dessert, a tasty berry cobbler and banana pudding.  Halfway through my cobbler I hit my max and gave up.  If we could have lolled around and napped we might have been able to finish, or explode.  I stopped short of saving a well picked bone to save and use as a Pebbles Flintstone hair clip just so I could savor that smoky goodness for the rest of the day.  Big kudos to John and his family for taking the chance on this business.  We loved their attentive service, hospitality.  We will be back once we recover from the meat sweats and BBQ hangover!",

The only reason why I didn't give it another star and made it 4 stars- there's no room to eat peacefully. Its so small and cramped with a ton of people that it gets claustrophobic in there and I hate eating messy when someone 3 feet away can see me pigging out haha! Also, parking is a mothaf**cka, too small of a venue for the volume of customers.",

Hidden beyond the Vegas glitz & glamour, just underneath the Desert Inn Arterial over pass, comes a well known local bbq/soul food establishment of roots from Arkansas.  In what seems to be a shady location just blocks from famous Vegas strip clubs, comes a place called Rollin' Smoke. Yes, the area & location can be a little sketchy to those unfamiliar especially at night...but don't let that stop you from coming in.  Featured on TV...the marketing campaign and Yelp reviews can speak for it self. With more than that....The wifey and I thought we would pay homage and taste what all the hype was about...considering it too was recommended by friends and co-workers. We went on a Thursday night, about an hour before closing and service was pretty quick with a good amount of customers dining in and carry out. Fairly a small southern hospitality type of place, it caters to a back yard southern type of feeling.  We chose to try the 5 meat platter to taste the different flavors. Ribs, pulled pork, sausage, brisket, & chicken. Came also with 3 sides of your choice as we opted for loaded mash potatoes, mac & cheese and corn bread.   To our disappointment, the ribs were a little salty & the flavor wasn't all that. The ribs were a little dry and not fall off the bone tender juicy. They also only had 3 types of sauces on the counter to choose from...one of which tasted like a mixture of mustard and ketchup. Still it was decent sauce. Not really sure what it was, maybe I got caught off guard because it was almost closing time, or maybe the meat wasn't as fresh or maybe I was just expecting too much from all the hype.  Maybe I should have said something or ask for recommendations and favorites...but I didn't want to make a big deal. Food was still good and plenty and did fill us up & even had left overs to take home.  Still, I only knocked off 2 stars because of my expectations. Service was excellent, atmosphere and staff were very friendly. I do want to give them a second chance and maybe even try their famous outlaw burger. I definitely want to give them a higher rating. I mean I could be wrong, because everyone else seems to love their BBQ.  Please Rollin' Smoke ... Make me a believer and want to come back...because whether it was hype or not...the place is legit & deserves a second chance!",

I was advised to try the potato salad, Because their mama made it. (Heard in the background say yup) haha.  Main course : I ordered the baby back and beef ribs, both were off the chart. Meat fell off the bone, and it was cooked with just the right amount of seasonings. Potato salad was indeed really good.   I did not eat inside but the atmosphere was lively and super chill and diverse. Everybody's head was down looking at their plate.   Overall, I knew I was in the mood for bbq but with the great customer service on the phone, friendly environment inside, & kick ass food, I'm definitely coming back for more.   Ps the house sauce and vinaigrette was my favorite.",

I am giving my 300th review to Rollin' Smoke BBQ. Definitely a solid 4 star meal when it comes to BBQ beef brisket. I just tried the Brisket 3 Ways which consisted of sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and burnt ends. The meat was very good on its own, but I added some of their Arkansas BBQ sauce to it. I thought their bbq sauce was excellent. They also offered a sweet bbq sauce, but I preferred the tangy version. I also ordered a side of waffle cut fries, which were seasoned very well.  I will definitely be back to try the beef ribs and some other menu items. I will probably add another star on my next visit if the beef ribs are as good as the brisket.",

I can honestly say I'm blown away!!!    Let's start with the atmosphere upon walking in, you feel like you've left Vegas and entered the south. The people could not have been any nicer!  They gave us fantastic recommendations (get the smoked meatloaf) and we're not wrong in any of them.   You want to talk about FAST FOOD?!  We had our meals before we even sat down!!    Honestly this place is top notch BBQ and I'd even say it's better than any of the bigger names found in Texas!    We decided we needed to try some dessert so we ordered the peach cobbler and the banana puddin. The cashier told us that the pudding was all out and we were totally bummed...a few minutes later someone came back to our table and said \"wait...I'm going back to make more pudding for you right now!l. What?!!  Are you kidding me?!!!    This place is fantastic!  Everyone came by to make sure we were taken care of and didn't need anything.   If you're ever in Vegas and love BBQ, you MUST come here and patronize them!!!    Thank you for making our trip end on a memorable note!!!!",

    "text": "I started looking for barbecue in Las Vegas and had already bookmarked a few, but nothing looked like what I had in mind.  Then I stumbled on Rollin Smoke on Yelp and thought, this could be it.  Now the name Rollin Smoke has a completely different connotation if you're not thinking about smoked meat, but let's not go there.  Let's go to the 'cue.  What to get?  I read about smoked meatloaf, and the pictures look good, but hey, it's meatloaf.  You don't judge a barbecue place by the meatloaf.  You want brisket and you want ribs.  I was particularly interested in beef ribs, and they have them on the smoker here every day.  How about some pork ribs?  They have a rib platter with baby backs, spare ribs and a beef rib.  Add another beef rib for $6.  Sounds good, but too much for today.  The beef rib was just what I was looking for.  Thick and meaty, dark with smoke on the outside, and juicy and fork tender inside.  Just pull gently and it releases from the bone with a puff of steam and meat juices rolling down to the plate.  The meat is seasoned, but not overdone.  There's some rub and some smoke flavor, but it's not dominant.  You can really taste the meat.  Barbecue sauce is offered, but with meat this good, who needs it?  Spareribs were also terrific, again partly because they are nice and thick.  They have good texture and are juicy and moist, with good smoke flavor and seasoning.  Baby backs were a little disappointing, still tender, but a little drier, and at least on this day, didn't stack up to the flavor of the spareribs and beef.    There are two dining rooms inside and a few tables outside.  The store is just a few blocks off the strip, just on the other side of I-15.  Parking can be tough, but come between the lunch hour and the dinner hour and there's no trouble.  Who doesn't like linner?  Staff was friendly and helpful, joking and laughing, and made a point to come around to all the tables to check on everyone to see how they liked their barbecue.   There are plenty of sides, and I had the corn fritters.  Folks rave about them.  They're good.   They're fried nuggets of batter encapsulating some sweet corn kernels, but I was here for the ribs, and was not disappointed.  I'll be back again for the brisket and some burnt ends.",

The Smoked Meatloaf was so GOOD!!  Better than your mother's meatloaf for sure!  It is a HUGE portion though so either share with a friend or be prepared to take some home for another meal.  My husband really liked the brisket sandwich and coleslaw too.  Someone who I assume was the owner or one of the owners came out and talked to us.  It was apparent that he cared that we actually enjoyed the food.  We loved it and will put on our list anytime we are in Vegas.  Thanks for the great meal!",

Pulling up you see a giant smoker and I'm not talking Chad with his peace pipe. Parked the car (double locked them doors) but didn't let it stop me. If this is where it ends it ends.  Walked in to the friendliest smile I had ever seen. Gave the place a quick overview and thought maybe I should just keep it moving. But that smell drew me right back in. Looking at the menu I had no clue what to order. Walked to the counter & im ashamed to say it, asked \"what's good\". At this point I wanted the sauce over the glock. Everything pictured on that menu looked great. My eyes were to big for my stomach. I ended up going off the what the cashier had recommended. Which was the pulled pork and brisket nachos. A bottom layer of waffle fries with beans pulled pork brisket layered with all your hearts desires. As well as your arteries worst nightmare. With a side of pickles?! Oh baby!  Food arrived at the table and let me tell you this, it must of been a pound of food. I thought this was a side, or a small appetizer. But no this was the real deal the match had begun. They have their trademark sauce but you don't need it. It was perfect the way it was. This plate should defiantly be shared. But momma didn't raise no b*#$h. Sadly she might have half the plate was left, I was forced to tap.   This is where my review ends. As I waddled back to my car I realized some of the best places here in Vegas are these little hidden gems. If your visiting Las Vegas don't be Afraid to go off the beaten path.

Except for their spare ribs, I've legit had better ribs from Chili's.   Meat was tough and flavor was subpar. It was average at best. Spent about $28 on the platter, and I must say it was an expensive disappointment. Can't speak for their other meat, but their ribs are definitely something I'd shy away from.",

I'm from SC, and if you know anything about SC, we know great food, especially BBQ.  FROM the time my feet touch the pavement of the parking lot, I could smell that great southern cooking.  And I told my guests that were with me that they were in for a treat.  Not only was the food great; however, the care and hospitality that we RECEIVED FROM MS. LIZELLE made me feel like I was back home in my grandma's kitchen.  I want to thank MR. DUSTI AND MR. JOHN for putting together a great team, and y'all make sure you give LIZELLE a great big ATAGURL for ME....YA HEAR...  GOD BLESS Y'ALL AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.....TY JESUS O'LORD....   COL. W, INC...

My son complained about the serving amount for the price (cause he'd been there before.) Someone came out from the back and gave him another sandwich. His fish tasted lousy to me. As for me, they didn't offer me anything. Which was ok, I probably would have refused it anyway. Go back? Not on your life!",

Ordered the duo meats with 2 meats of your choice and a side, 1/2lb rib tips, and a side of cornbread for 2 people. It ended up being way too much food, but to be honest who doesn't love a generous amount of food for the great prices? Rib tips were more meat than cartilage, juicy spare ribs, and moist sliced brisket. You really can't go wrong with any sauce because they were all delicious, but my favorite was the \"sweet country girl\" which was mustardy.",

Oh and it's marinated perfectly fine.  + Mac & Cheese - Ooey goeey goodness.

The brisket sandwhich and any 2 meat plate was great just enough to satisfy and leave you full! Definitely coming again!",

Exploring was fun :)  Living in Oklahoma has lent me a very specific palate for Que.  I like my meats with little sauce and plenty of seasoned flair. Rollin Smoke could give the mid-west a little competition! We were also fortune enough to drop by on a day where they were setting up a photobooth for a children's charity.  The decor was minimal, as it should be. Sort of picnic style. Ordered at the podium. There was plenty of room for large groups. My party consisted of 7. We order a couple things to share and it was more than enough.  Chicken and pulled pork. Holy. Hell. Both were super moist and tender. The chicken was my favorite by far. Nice smokey goodness. It had great smoke flavor and fell off the frekkin' bone. My two favorite things!  Brisket- Sad to report that it was too dry for me.  Kudos Rollin Smoke! I'm bring the man zone here when we're in town!",

Let's start with the positive corn nuggets sweet tea BBQ Chicken baby back ribs BBQ beef ribs   I like the casual restaurant vibe, they bring you your food but it's pretty quick and easy to eat and go. Prices are reasonable-hope they don't change.   On to the negative-brisket and pulled pork was almost identical. One of them was dry and I forgot which one. One was good. Guess I should have remembered.  The mac and cheese was nothing special. BBQ beef ribs was burnt one time and small the next time. Collard greens-just ok.   I would suggest sharing food to try more things. We get the same things each time we go and I guess I am okay with that.",

    "text": "[Update 7/1/19 - Dined again a few weeks ago. Food remained amazing however the wait was 63 minutes for two pounds of food for a take out order. Staff was very friendly however]  Those super-annoying gluten free hipsters?  I live with one, except she tries not to be.  Super-annoying that is, not the gluten-free part, which she can't help.  You see, she is part of about 1% of the population who has Celiac disease, which is a genetic lottery prize that bestows upon the lucky few the ability to projectile piss out of one's poop-hole for extended periods when the smallest morsel of pasta or bread comes into contact with one's stomach lining.  The monotony of the resultant, laborious bathroom breaks are broken up only by extended bouts of abdominal cramps comparable to those involving giving birth to over-sized children.  By sheer, weird coincidence she has experience with this also.    In any case, tonight we ordered our usual two orders of meats taking special care to put \"no bread please\" via our Uber-Eats app.  The ribs and chicken orders promptly came an hour later served on a bed of fluffy, glutinous bread.  Disappointing, but no big deal.  Having lived with this curse her whole life, she has grown used to disappointment--perhaps this is why she is currently dating me.  Undeterred, I simply reported the discrepancy via the app and attempted to re-order so that our lives and bottoms can live on without issue or anal pain.  I get the notification from the app that the order was received and that the establishment was currently preparing our second order of the night.  We smile, turn back on our Fortnite, and I pick up the phone to make sure it doesn't happen again.     A gentleman answered the phone.  Requesting the manager, I was told that he could help since there was no manager tonight but he has been there the longest and could address any concern I had.  I informed him of girlfriend's Celiac disease and the name of my order and was promised that this next order would be prepared minus the bread this time.  Minutes pass and Uber notifies me that my order has been cancelled.  I call back, the same gentleman picked up and I asked if the order could be un-cancelled somehow.  Apparently it was because the chicken was out.  No worries, I informed him that we would take whatever meat was left over.  Starving women can't be choosers, after all.  He puts me on a brief hold so that he could speak to the manager who has now magically appeared from when minutes earlier there was none on duty.  I was then informed that their iPads turn off at 9:30 and that there was no way to have something ordered unless we had a driver come out there.  No problem, I said.  I would personally drive out because I was in no mood to deal with Ms. Hangry at home all night.  At this point he promptly hung up the phone.  Perhaps it was a dropped call--no matter, I'll call back.  I let it ring ten times.  I called back a second and third time and the prompts looped me back again and again to the robotic voice asking if I want directions or hours.  It was now 9:40PM and they were about to close.  So here I sit now with delicious barbecue in the garbage unable to be eaten yet I still have a bad taste in my mouth from Rollin Smoke.  In the past two months I have ordered five times from the Flamingo Location as a treat for the house for the one time we get to order out during the week--we ordered from this Highland location this time since Flamingo closed at 8:00pm.  It will absolutely be the last time.  I have no doubt that the food here is amazing also; however, the apathetic customer service and poor execution of operations leave much to be desired.  I humbly suggest that the transcription process between Ubereats and the restaurant be reviewed.  The yellow receipt on the bag made no mention of the allergy request but the Ubereats receipt clearly did.  Per the restaurant was swamped during this busy holiday weekend, but extra care should still be taken to be vigilant of customers with awful food curses who would rather not play diarrhea roulette during dinner.",

However, very worthy of looking for it, as their beef ribs are FANTASTIC! I've never been a fan of beef ribs (always preferred babyback or spare ribs), as they've always been too dry/tough and just not good, but Rollin Smoke made me change my mind. Matter of fact, we've come back to this place 2 more times since our initial visit, just for said beef ribs.  And the 5-star review is just for the beef ribs. Holy brontosaurus ribs, as in Fred Flintstone would be proud.  Their sides are.. OK. But I'm more than happy to scope out another place for the fixings, as long as I get more of the beef ribs.",

    "text": "First time in my life, I've been craving BBQ almost on a daily basis. I credit (or blame) Rollin Smoke for that. I come to LV several times a year, and almost always end up eating on/near the Strip. But this time, I took a drive out here, under a freeway overpass, next to a strip club, in a less than glitzy part of Vegas. But so what, it's all worth it.  Upon entering, you'll see the seating is communal, resembling picnic tables & benches. Once you decide what you want, place your order at the counter. Grab a table and in a mere minutes, someone calls out your name. You better answer, because he's holding your food.   I would've gotten the 5 Meat Pit Special, but the wife isn't exactly a carnivore. So I ended up with the Trio Basket; 3 meats and one side. Chose ribs (of course) brisket & pulled pork.   Ribs: F-ing awesome (and I rarely swear about food) Smoky, salty, tender and a bit fatty. I'm craving hard as I'm typing.   Brisket: Covered in a crust of coarse pepper, it is so tender with small chunks of fat to give it that greasy coating.   Pulled pork; Super tender but bland as hell by itself. Grab some sauce to give it life. Would not order again  Corn bread; sweet, sticky and moist. Perfect ending to the a meal of meats.   Extra order of Corn nuggets; Because the fatty meats aren't heavy enough, these fried corn nugz are great, and have a slightly sweet finish.   Napkins are on the table, and about 4 choices of various sauces are at the counter w/ small paper sauce cups. I'd say try all 4. They range from sweet to heat. Depends on what you get, it may add a new level of flavor, like the underwhelming pulled pork.   There are separate rooms. First is the main room, where the entrance, the ordering counter, and fountain drinks are. Over to the left, is another room with big screens airing sports. A third room is a bit larger, detached from the first 2 and seems quieter, but I never made it in there.   The food, came out fast and was excellent. The service, not bad. The girl who took our order really didn't want to be there. She was lethargic, and couldn't describe any of the flavors of the food to a first-timer. And all I asked was \"how is the pulled pork?' She answered, \"it's pulled pork.\" ...    I would, without a doubt, come back.",

I felt like it was for dessert because it comes to your table warm yummy and fully buttered which is an amazing experience , they serve you these little straw onion rings with your meal which are just like potato chips you want to keep eating them the service was excellent and I had everything with a root beer float which was exceptional :)))",

The parking lot is really small and can be a pain to park if they are busy.  I got the special which was 1/2 pound of rib tips and a sweet potato pie for only 10 bucks.  My wife got the two item meat which you get to pick 2 different meats.   She got pull pork and brisket.   For 3 dollars more you can get burnt tips for the brisket (so worth it).    They give you so much meat for your money here.  The tip tips were meaty and delicious.   The brisket burnt tips were the best out of everything!!    Caution: they use a lot of cracked pepper so it has a kick.   But the meat was so juiced and tender.   Amazing.    I'll be back",

If the food is still good after being delivered/picked up and sitting in some styrofoam for longer than it should be then you know you're in for some good eating.  What I like best is that the meats actually taste smoked but not overwhelmingly.  I don't even really use sauce the meat itself is so good.  I love the beef ribs.  So tender and delicious without anything to add.  I will say that their sauces are pretty great though.  Have some pulled meat with a sauce.  To die for!  The sides are pretty inventive and very tasty as well.   Definitely a great go to for a party!",

Not only is all of their food extremely delicious and flavorful but it's all homemade. Theirs sauces from bbq to tartar sauce is so yummy. Also their cuts of meats we tried were exquisite. Best rib tips/burnt ends I've ever tried and the brisket was so moist and juicy.... omg, amazing. The Mac and cheese is so different than any Mac I've had but it was delicious, beans, dirty ice and fries were awesome. They use a lot of peppercorn in their food so it gives and extra kick which is so good.   They restaurant looks really small on the outside but they have a lot of room inside. And they have TVs and such. We watched the game it was pretty cool to have. It's kinda in the backstreets of vegas off the strip but it's great bbq. It's totally worth going off the strip. Service was terrific, the only thing I could've asked for is if they wiped down the tables more often but it's no biggie.",

I also thought the red cabbage was a nice touch. Baby backs are not fall off the bone, but good flavor. Really liked the homemade BBQ sauce sitting on the table. Sides: corn nuggets - OK, not much flavor; waffle fries - no Bueno, probably a frozen product and they were served cooler than room temp; Jalapeno Cole slaw - good (not great), I did like the contrasting sensation spicy and cool-slaw.

When I complained they brought out a new bag and when I took the spoon out of the new bag that I opened it had a dried worm on it. The food was greasy and my chicken was half raw..my friend's was cold. They use breed as filler for everything including massed potatoes.

    "text": "We got the Pit Special that came with 5 meats and 3 sides. All the meats were mediocre with the exception of the pulled pork which was actually really good. The sides we got were the waffle fries, loaded mash, and bbq beans. The waffle fries were tasty and seasoned well with a nice, crisp exterior. The loaded mash isn't worth it, they tasted like instant mash potatoes which it probably was. Also the baked beans weren't that great either. Lastly, usually if the meat isn't great the sauce makes up for it but not this time. I did like that there were a variety of sauces to choose from but they weren't that great and some of them kind of tasted similar.",

    "text": "I was pretty impressed. Never expected to find barbecue this good just off the Strip. My wife and I split a combo plate (I forget what it was called) so we could try everything. So, from best to less best:  Brisket: Top-notch. Moist, flavorful, well-smoked. A delight. Ribs: Split verdict. I thought they were great, wife finds beef ribs a bit too chewy but admitted the flavor was great. Hot Links: Excellent. Spicy and flavorful. Pulled Pork: A bit dry and not up to the standard set by the other meats. That said, there sure weren't any leftovers.  Sauce: Pretty ordinary, really. Not bad, though, and the meats don't need its help, so it actually works pretty well in a supporting role.  Beans: Fantastic. Almost like a bowl of chili. You could make a meal out of these alone. Potato Salad: Maybe the best ever. Bacon really does make everything better. Cole Slaw: Unique and original, but didn't really work for us. The only real misfire in an otherwise exceptional meal.  This is a really good barbecue joint, bordering on greatness. When you factor in its unexpected location, it probably deserves five stars. Barbecue snobs that we are, we just can't quite grant that ranking when comparing it to Kansas City's best. Guaranteed, next time we're in Vegas, we'll be back. Friendly folks and good food bring us back every time.",

    "text": "I do not usually take the time to make Yelp reviews (or at least, not to actually comment), but I had to share this secret with everyone... Rollin Smoke is the real deal!  I was in Vegas on a business trip and tried it on a lark... Where have you been all my life, Rollin Smoke Barbeque?!  As soon as I walked in, I could smell it... That authentic smoke that portents rich, savory flavor in meat (if it is done correctly, and Dusty - the proprietor of this gem - does it correctly).  Their prices were definitely solid for definitely solid for the portion size, which is a pretty remarkable thing in Vegas.  There is even a 10% off coupon on their website!  I got the all-you-can-eat deal (which is all you can eat of anything on their menu... anything!) because I wanted to try a bit of many different things, and it was $21.50 after coupon.  But their other meals and combos were very reasonably priced as well.  Now for the feast... I tried sausage, brisket, hot wings, spare ribs, and beef ribs, but they also had shrimp, catfish, baby back ribs, chicken, hush puppies, beans, and on and on and on.  The sausage was solid with a nice little kick.  The brisket was a little lean, but very tender and tasty.  I got the \"Damn Hot\" hot wings (I have won several wing challenges in my day), and I don't know if they were trying harder to hurt me than normal, but they were HOT, with a building heat that walked that line between pleasure and pain.  All of that was great, but the ribs really shined.  The spare ribs were large and meaty, with a deep-down smoke flavor that spoke volumes about the slow care that went into their creation.  And the beef ribs, which Dusty insisted I try, were the coup de gras... Meaty, mild, flavorful, and tender... The best beef ribs I have ever had, no contest!  And how did I finish this homage to gluttony?  With a homemade bread pudding (covered in whiskey sauce) that was heavenly!!  Dusty himself chatted with me and my friends for a bit - telling us about his cooking process, the pride he (as Pit Master) takes in his food, and the labor of love his restaurant has become - and we even got to meet the special chef whose grandmother's bread pudding recipe would now forever haunt my dreams.  This is THE hidden gem of Las Vegas...  I have lived all throughout the South (Texas, Georgia, Virginia, and everywhere in between), and this is the BEST BARBEQUE I HAVE EVER HAD!!  If you like barbeque, and you are coming to Las Vegas, I highly recommend you give this place a shot.  Note to Guy Fieri: this place needs to be on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, immediately!",

Take your local county fair, where the only thing in common between the display photos and the food is how plastic, dry and devoid of flavor the food is.   This place is a lot closer to the former, because everything was excellent (we didn't order sides, though). All the meats had a prominent smoky flavor and was thoroughly moist, though I'd definitely give special attention to the burnt ends and the ribs. We also had the sliced brisket which we preferred over the chopped up version. It was leaner so definitely not as moist as the aforementioned two options but definitely still tender. Portions are huge - we ordered four pounds of meat for four people - which we discovered was slightly excessive.  There's literally four (or five? or six?) different sauce options so you can go wild. Of note, though, the spicy is the best. Drinks are refillable and the drink cups are non-disposable souvenir options that you can take home and bring back to get a discount on fountain drinks. Great idea in theory, but I already lost mine  \\_()_/ .",

My wife and I pigged out on the pork ribs and meatloaf with sides of the corn cheese nuggets, dirty rice, and mac and cheese. The pork ribs were really soft and tender, but it was their spicy bbq sauce that was the icing on the cake. I'm gonna have to get a bottle of that sauce to take home the next time that I'm there. The meatloaf had a lot different flavors going on, and the smokiness was a bit overpowering. Still good nonetheless. The corn cheese nuggets were bomb! Crispy on the outside and soft and cheesy on the inside.   They also have an AYCE option for $34.99. If you have the munchies and you're looking to feast, that option will be worth it for you.

I'm from Texas after all, with roots in the southeast, and I've had the best 'cue in all of the typical BBQ Meccas: Austin, Nashville, Memphis, 'Carolina (both of them), and St Louis. So when I think of good smoked meat, Vegas isn't even really on my radar.  Well I guess I should have known that a town like Vegas can attract the best of everything, and they've certainly done it when it comes to BBQ. I ordered a three meat with brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, and all three were completely up to snuff. The brisket was tender and had a nice peppery bark (my favorite part). The pork was just as it should be (let's face it, pulled pork is hard to mess up as far as BBQ goes), and the ribs were big, meaty, flavorful, and the right texture.   The meat should be the star of any BBQ joint, and it definitely is here, but the sides at rollin smoke were standouts too. I got the BBQ beans and the bacon potato salad. They didn't bunt on the sides one but. The beans were really well seasoned and were full of meaty goodness (brisket I'm guessing) and the potato salad had a good mustard kick without turning into mustard salad with some potatoes. Plus, bacon.  I tried two sauces, just for fun. The meat didn't need them. The NC style vinegar was perfect for my pulled pork and the spicy sauce was delicious. But again, not required at all. Maybe just a bit of salt.  I'd have liked to see pickles, onions, and jalapenos on the side  like we get here in TX, but that's just quibbling. Major props to whoever is running the pit here. I'll be back, and rest assured it's worth the stop.  Oh, one more thing, the employees were all very friendly and helpful. The counter girl was very pleasant - say hi to Crystal when you stop in. (Hope I got her name right!)",

The Cole slaw is a vinegar style with a little kick; the mac & cheese is very good and the potato salad has bits of crunchy bacon!

Best part was probably the most reasonable priced place we ate at the whole week!",

    "text": "Last minute lunch decision before heading out of Vegas. I had this place bookmarked in Yelp and now I know why. I started with a half rack of baby back ribs. They were smokey, tender and juicy. Seasoned to perfection with a course pepper crust. The cuts were great with the perfect meat to fat ratio - more meat than fat, but enough fat for flavor. Served over white bread with a side of dill pickles. The Arkansas sweet sauce paired perfectly.   I was craving a hot dog all week so I had the dog from the kids menu. It was a big, beefy dog on a hoagie roll. It was more than a kid should eat. House sauce on this one was awesome. Added a side of loaded mashed potatoes. Not sure, but these might be instant potatoes. They reminded me of KFC which isn't a bad thing. Topped with cheddar, green onion and bacon; it was delicious. Closer to 4.5 stars overall. If you want bbq in Vegas, this is it.",

    "text": "Exterior = 3/5 The location is off the strip, but slightly next to the freeway. It was kind of hard to find the place because its further in and side streets had a few turns from the path we took (we were coming from MGM). It looked like a legit hole in the wall restaurant. It was situated in an L shaped plaza with a couple other stores. The parking was open, no validation needed. I couldn't tell if the place was the barbecue place until I walked up and stared at the menu on the door.   Interior = 4/5  Place was nicely decorated. There were two places for sitting, the main area with the cashier and a side area with more benches and booths. It was pretty easy to find seating and they even have all the barbecue sauces in the side with little cups which was so convenient. I can see how it can get crowded especially if the line is long, which can get bothersome for some of the people sitting down since the line wraps around the benches in area.  Service = 5/5 The cashier was super friendly and gave us recommendations on what to get and his recommendations were on point. He took his time to explain everything as well since we didn't know what burnt ends were. After we ordered, and we're eating, the owner went around saying hi and greeting people asking how the food was. So the environment was super friendly.  Order = 5/5 We got a sampler (chicken, brisket, ribs) with half a pound of burnt ends, as well as the coleslaw, corn, and Max and cheese. I loved all of the sauces, so try everything - each has a unique flavor and texture. The food was so yummy. I found the chicken to be good, it wasn't dry like other places and the brisket and ribs were good. What stole the show was the burnt ends. That was beyond delicious and just the right amount of fat so it was soft and full of flavor. I found it cool they served it on bread, I thought it was to soak up oil or grease. Whatever it was used for it was cool. The sides were okay, I liked the coleslaw had a bit of a bite and the boyfriend loved the corn.  Overall = 4/5  Great food experience for barbecue. Probably one of my favorites, since the meet was full of flavor and not dried. Service was welcoming too and makes it comfortable for first timers. I will come back and order a pound of burnt ends.  Hint = get the burnt ends.",

The bananna bread pudding was really good too my friend raved about it, you gotta try it!  To top off the good food the staff was exceptionally nice and welcoming. They seemed to really care how the costumers were liking their food. They came out and were interacting with everyone and making sure they were satisfied.

    "text": "As much as I love barbeque, I haven't been happy with any one place in town.  Some have great meat, some have great sauce, but none had both.. until now.  Hubby and I went with a friend to try this place out and left with full tummies and happy faces.  First, ambiance.. it's a tiny place inside an industrial strip mall next to an overpass.. the word \"dive\" was invented for this place, I believe.  Trust me, you won't care.  The new tables inside are nice, though.  Service.. great!  Now for the best part.. the food.  The sides were average to good, but we didn't try a lot of them.  Cole slaw was \"interesting\", mac n cheese was \"okay\", baked beans were \"good!\" .. but we forgot those as soon as we bit into our meats.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, the \"Piggy\", which came with a side and a drink.  The sandwich was enormous.. first thing I did was cut it in half for taking home half of it.  Then I bit into it and all my taste buds jumped up and did a cheer.  It was the most incredible pulled pork I've ever had.  Superlatives abound.. juicy, tender, meaty, saucy, omg nom nom nom.  I'll be honest.. that other half never stood a chance of going home, I ate it all.  Hubby couldn't decide so he got a half rack each of the baby back pork ribs and the beef ribs.  He was exclaiming about how incredible the pork ribs were and then he tried the beef, completely forgot the pork was there.  He's definitely a beef ribs guy, always prefers those, and found a level of beef rib heaven he hadn't known existed.  And the size of those beef ribs?  Definitely brontosaurus sized, massive amount of meat on each rib.    Our friend got \"The Biggin\" sandwich and the brisket sandwich.  He devoured the Biggin and was making lots of strange noises, occasionally coming up for air to proclaim the food amazing.  The brisket arrived a bit later, and brought out a new level of attention - he said it was as tender as a pulled pork sandwich and we all were amazed that there was moist and tender brisket, because every other bbq joint manages to dry the meat out.  Since he has two hollow legs, he ate every bite of both of those monster sandwiches.  The prices are cheap, the food is amazing, and it's probably good that they're not located closer to home ;D.  I'm willing to bet that the Pitmaster there gets marriage proposals on a daily basis, because of his great food.  Hubby was ready to ask for a divorce so he could marry him, and I would have understood... ;)",

Me?  although i love a juicy $50 steak someone else is paying for, when i spend my own money, i love to find treasures like RSB.  A hole in the wall that you need to travel off strip for in the industrial district, but, ROLLIN SMOKE BARBEQUE is well worth the effort!.    The menu is pretty simple but with a wide variety of options.  I asked for a suggestion and was told the brisket and rib plate with slaw.  FABULOUS choice!  The brisket was tender and thinly sliced.  The subtle smoke flavor was deep in the meat.  The ribs fell right off of the bone with just the right amount of sauce to compliment the meat.  The slaw was fresh and spicy and had some corn in it to add to the flavor.  Team was friendly.  The place was clean.  If you are looking for a burger, i saw one being delivered to a table that looked incredible.  If visiting from out of town and want a real treat at an affordable price, go here!",

I must say, to my disappointment that I did not get to try as much as I should have. I had the Pull \"Piggy\" as it's called, which is pulled pork on a hoagie roll. I read some other reviews that it was pretty large and since I was coming for lunch I didn't want to over do it. My mistake. It wasn't that big at all. Simple six-inch hoagie roll stuffed with smoked pulled pork with a drizzle of their bbq sauce and some green onions. It was very stuffed, but I still wasn't full afterwards. My fiance got a sandwich as well, the beef brisket. Both were absolutely amazing. The meat is tender and packed with flavor. The bbq sauce isn't overwhelming and heavy - enough to add flavor and more moistness.   All-in-all, I cannot wait to come back to this place. They have AYCE for $25, anytime any item.

Pork was moist and tender, and had great flavor. The Hush Puppies had a mild jalapeno tang to them, and I thought about ordering more since I finished them early, but the combo meal with a Country Berry Cobbler side completely filled me up. The cobbler was THE best I've ever tasted. Will definitely be back here next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "I see a ton of 5 stars for Rollin Smoke and I can understand why.  I'd give 4.5 for the family atmosphere and the food.    The brisket was extremely well done and the pulled pork tasted amazing, unfortunately the ribs were a little on the dry side but the sauce they have made up for it.  When we visited here this weekend the owner's mom was there and she was such a sweat heart.  I almost feel bad giving 4 stars just because of her.    The place itself isn't much to look at and the location is definitely off the beaten path.    Rollin Smoke is at least worth a trip to give it a try, personally I don't \"crave\" BBQ all that often and usually Famous Dave's or Lucille's will do the job if I do.  Overall tho, good food, worth a trip to try once, but don't think I'll go out of my way to try again.",

We were luck to grab a seat in the side room. My wife and I split the 4 meat 3 side combo. We had the pulled pork, brisket and double spare ribs. Sides were hush puppies, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.the brisket was good but I enjoyed the pork and ribs mostly. Great smoke taste and I add a bit of the BBQ sauce for extra flavor. All the sides where great. Mac and cheese and hush puppies are where it's at! A bit small in here but great food!",

    "text": "Good barbecue is one of the most rewarding finds in the culinary world. First, one has to learn about the place, then one has to hunt it down, then one has to resist the urge to leave... because NO barbecue restaurant worth it's prices boasts the most upscale  atmosphere or structural amenities.   But then the food comes; and one is suddenly more happy to be sitting at that grubby, sweaty little picnic table than they could have ever anticipated.   So, that being said, Rolling Smoke Barbecue is the finest quintessential barbecue experience I've had in fifteen years in Las Vegas.   I learned about Rolling Smoke from one of their newest team-members, \"Chef\" Nick. He's been a close friend of mine for years, and he has been doing an amazing job promoting the business. He greeted me when I came in, too, which was classy.   The service otherwise was gracious and friendly, the Atmosphere was as modest as barbecue gold mines can get, and the food...  Wow... The food.  The ribs, brisket, and pork I purchased practically melted in my mouth, leaving behind only the subtle texture of the meats' not-so-subtle spice rub; a rub that thankfully doesn't overpower the undeniably robust flavors of the proteins themselves.   ...A flavor that makes it completely understandable that the restaurant is perpetually inundated with a line of hungry patrons. Don't worry - though - the kitchen has it down and they churn out an order every fifty seconds or so.  Oh, and at just over $15 (prior to well-earned gratuity), this barbecue meal is certainly worth the price.   Please, go check this place out. It will leave you entirely satisfied and grateful that you stuck around.",

After eating dinner at this place late Saturday night, I am heartbroken that it's closed on Sunday because I was ready to head back the next day for lunch to have the $25 all-you-can eat (ANYTHING ON THE MENU!!!) feast.  The ribs literally fell off the bone.  I cut the brisket with a plastic fork.  The bbq sauce was incredible.  Do yourself a favor and get the smoked meatloaf, which is served on a bed of some of the best mashed potatoes and is smothered in tasty onion strings.  The staff was super friendly.

This BBQ rivals or exceeds the best we've found anywhere in the U.S. their brisket is smokey and falls apart ... the staff, especially James and Dusty the owner made the whole experience even better.  No matter what we tried ... every meat was distinct in flavor and texture and their selection of 5 or 6 homemade BBQ sauces provided unique new experience to each.  Don't even get me started on the sides ... from the mac and cheese to the collard greens (oooh those greens)   The best surprise of all was the prices, yes best surprise ... so reasonable and for generous portions.  Take your time when you go ... enjoy the food and the people ... Strongly Recommend anyone from the BBQ novice to a competitive BBQ judge give it a try, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Came here with my boys the other day.  This is definitely a gem located in a hole in a wall in the middle of red light district.  We were a little skeptical at first but since the reviews were great, we decided to go inside and try it out.  The place is not that big but it is full of people.  It smells great inside... something you would expect in a bbq joint.  You pick a table then go to the guy where you can place your order and pay.  They will then bring you your food.  Drinks and utensils are self served.    The menu is filled with great selection of yummy food. We ordered the following (our eyes were bigger than our stomach for sure):  1) The Pit Special (4 choices of meat + 3 sides) -  We picked the brisket, pulled pork, double on the spare ribs, corn nuggets, bacon potato salad & mac & cheese.  The brisket was disappointing coz it was dry. The pulled pork has great flavor. The ribs is perfect! I love love the ribs... glad we doubled up on this.  The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad are amazing!  The mac & cheese is ok, had better.  2) Meatloaf + corn bread for his side - my son loved this one. The meat taste great but the onion rings are overpowering for me (not a big fan of onions). Now the corn bread is to die for!  It's moist and totally delish... one of the best that I've had.   3) Chicken Wings (Buffalo) + Waffle Fries - my husband loved the hot sauce but he said the wings was alright (he had the hot sauce on the side). The waffle fries was not bad but it wasn't great either.  4) Banana Pudding - this was disappointing for me. It taste like it came out of a package.   Overall, this place is definitely a keeper for us.  We are all looking forward on coming back to try the other food on their menu.  The price is not bad, food is great, ambiance is casual & food servings are good size.",

    "text": "Rollin Smoke wins my vote for best BBQ in Vegas. They are nestled in the heart of the strip club district on Industrial, but worth the drive to the neighborhood. I've been here a few times with large groups of people and I love the pit room in the back, it even has a really cool grill fish tank.   Rollin Smoke really excels at their BBQ and sauces. We always get the pit special, 4 meats and 3 sides, and it feeds my little family of three. Their ribs and brisket are especially good. They do lack consistency though, the first time I had the brisket I could cut it with a fork and another time it was a bit tough. Either way, you want to slather it in the sauce on the table, it's the perfect tangy sweet spicy BBQ sauce.   Rollin Smoke is a bit of a let down when it comes to sides. I've tried many of them and the only ones worth mentioning in my opinion are the waffle fries, the green beans, and the hush puppies. You do definitely want a side of corn bread though, it's so good and sitting in a little butter bath. YES! You also want dessert, the banana pudding is pretty darn good and the peach cobbler is good but a little on the sweet side.   Definitely the best BBQ in Vegas, not the best I've ever had, but the best we've got!",

    "text": "Hello everybody. If you are looking for tasty BBQ you have found the right place. I have been smoking my own meats for months so I wanted to compare what I am doing to what they are doing. My uncle from Casper loves the place so I wanted to see wassup. I have smoked prime rib, ribs, chicken, steaks, potatoes, onions, and pork butt using mostly apple wood. I asked the waiter what kind of wood my St. Louis style ribs were smoked on and he said \"I honestly don't know\".  I was disappointed with that answer BUT one minute later he came back and told me \"hickory\".  I will be using hickory on my next 6 hour rib smoke because it is soooo delicious. I saw a review talking shmack about no smoke ring. \"More of a smoke ring on my clothes than the meat\". That is BS. See photos. I ordered the half rack of St. Louis style because I have cut racks in half at home and figured I could eat all that. I was wrong. There was way more meat than I could eat for sure. Plus the bomb ass corn nuggets were irresistible. They were playing the Vegas Golden Knights game when we were there. I watched the Golden Knights tonight while eating heated up left over ribs under the broiler. Go Knights!!!  And some people complained about the location.  What??!! I know ghetto and the place is off the strip but it is NOT ghetto or unsafe or \"Compton\" or whatever haters be saying while sipping Haterade. I didn't feel unsafe at all. I want to add that the staff were super attentive and constantly checked on us. The first two photos are from Rollin Smoke and the others are from my smokin. If you like smoked meat, go to Rollin Smoke and thank them for honing their craft for your benefit.",

Feeling the hunger pangs that had been growing all day we decided to go against the Vegas standard of hitting up a buffet and stopped in. It's a small place, rather unimpressive from the outside and your standard BBQ joint in the inside but you won't regret the food! We ordered the rib tips, the burnt ends and the hot links, all by the pound and shared between the all of us as a snack. Everyone was in agreement that it was some of the best bbq they've ever tasted and I'd have to agree. Spicy, smokey and not the overly sweet stuff other places serve. The favorite had to be the burnt ends, I could've eaten just that with some of the sides that I was eyeing. Next Vegas trip, I'm forgoing a buffet and spending a few good hours and eating the all you can eat special they've got there. Here's to next time!",

I got the AYCE for a reason, since I'm in Riverside County it wasn't everyday I could visit even though I wish I could.  The one issue I had was the timeline with the AYCE. The place was a bit loud which was ok with me. When I purchased the AYCE the gentleman at the register said something about the time, since there was a very long line I didn't want to hold it up. In any case, I asked another employee about the time and for some reason he had no idea what I was talking about.  Well the thing is you only have a 1 hour window from the time you purchase it so remember that when you get the AYCE. Since the line gets pretty long you might wait up to 10-15 mins each time which limits you tasting their deliciousness. So keep that in mind.  And last, they had no corn nuggets which was horrible. Thankfully I survived....",

I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of greens. Wasn't to keen on the hoagie roll (mainly because I'm used to pulled pork on hamburger buns), but that's inconsequential due to the fact that the pork was awesome. This is my main method of judging BBQ joints and they passed with flying colors. Added to that, the greens were perfect. If you've been missing collards, mustard, or turnip greens, this is a great combination of all three. Definitely check in first so you can get the dessert. I didn't but the server didn't mind adding the order, which was nice because of the consideration. I got the banana pudding which was good, but I would have liked to have had some bananas in it. Just preference, really, because the overall flavor was inline with what I wanted. Additionally, the service was very courteous and friendly. Overall, it would be really unfortunate to miss this place especially because there are so few good BBQ restaurants in this town. Check it out. This place is worth it.",

I ordered a half rack of the baby backs and the bacon potato salad, beans and peach cobbler. The ribs were adequate, very lean but something was missing. The potato salad had bacon sprinkled on top, would have preferred that the bacon be mixed in. The beans were delish. The peach cobbler was inedible. I think I found 1/2 of a peach slice and the rest was a mixture of soggy dough. I spent $34 for my meal, which is outrageous given that I threw the cobbler away. At Dinosaur, the ribs are excellent and a 1/2 slab, cornbread and two sides is less than $20 and believe me, you'll leave with a smile on your face.",

I have eaten BBQ in many major cities and several states and this is as good as I've ever had. We shared a big dinner that included ribs, chopped brisket, burnt ends, potato salad, beans, and mac & cheese. Every item and I do mean every one, was as good as I have ever eaten anywhere, any time. It was somewhat heavy and greasy but hey, it's BBQ! If this were health food I'd have it 3 times a week...as it is, I will probably go there once every month or two and be happy. If you like BBQ you MUST try this place.",

I got a two meat plate with two ribs and sausage.  The ribs were smokey and flavorful.  The sauce complimented them well.  The meat was nice and tender too.  The sausage was smokey and delicious as well.  My friend got a pulled pork sandwich and loved it.  We each got the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese is a good enough side to have as a main course.  I also got the corn poppers, which are a must try.  They're delicious and addictive.  The staff was really friendly to me and everyone else I saw in there.  We ate inside, but the outdoor tables looked like a good spot to hang out as well.  The place isn't super fancy, but who wants a super fancy BBQ spot anyway?  When I think of BBQ, I want real good food in a good environment.  This place delivers both.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

We all ordered different menu items but somehow we all wound up with the brisket, which was perfectly cooked. My husband isn't big on Carolina sauce, but he must've used half of the bottle while we ate. It was that good! I could've eaten a gallon of the Mac 'n' cheese all by myself. Which is a good sign because I'm very picky about Mac 'n' cheese.  I also could've eaten a gallon of greens, they were perfect!  There was so much food, I gave my leftovers to my brother. I think he may have finished them in the middle of the night.  Another thing I liked about this place was how friendly the staff was. Good food AND good customer service? Yes, please! Dusty was such a gracious person, I wanted to hang out with him and talk BBQ for the rest of the night.    We were a little nervous when we saw a line out the door, but once we finished eating, we understood why.  There is no way that food that good wouldn't have a huge line.  The only downside about this place is that it's in Las Vegas and we live in Los Angeles.  But from now on, this will be one of our stops when we're in town.",

I was hard pressed to find a side that wasn't spicy - jalapeno coleslaw and kickin' beans?! They let me substitute cornbread, and it was the best dang cornbread I've eaten in my life. So fluffy, so moist, so delicate, so smooth and sweet. Next time I need double corn bread! The ribs didn't have much of a smoke ring, but the smoke wasn't lacking and the rub was good. The sauce is spicy, but a perfect amount. The most impressive thing was when I asked for butter, they served me a container of warm melty butter, YUM!  My husband got brisket, which was kind of dry, but the seasoning was great, and it was perfectly salted. The loaded mashed potatoes were awesome, as if they mashed it using some of the bacon grease from the topping - so yummy.  Even my kid's food was good. The hot dog was a fat juicy meaty delicious thing, and he got hush puppies or corn nugget things that I couldn't stop stealing. The only thing he didn't like was that the cheese he ordered was spicy nacho cheese. No surprise.  This place is better than Dickeys, Road Kill Grill, and Famous Dave's, but Lucille's still takes the cake.",

If you don't like smoked meat this is not for you. The portion sizes are not very big so we ordered the four meat plate and did the the ribs on the side. Check your order before you leave. So far, this is the best BBQ I've had in Vegas. I liked the ribs and the beans the best, but the yams and potato salad weren't bad. Mac and cheese was pretty good. Waffle fries my least favorite and they needed salt.",

    "text": "OMG!  I am originally from Texas and miss very much the ability to get BBQ on every street corner.  This BBQ is as good as I am used to back home.   I had the pulled pork sandwich (tender as butter), the baked beans (spicy with huge chunks of meat), and the cornbread (incredible, not the least bit grainy with the perfect amount of sweet butter). The prices were reasonable, and the smells when I walked up were enough to work me into a feeding frenzy while I waited on my meal.  The service was friendly, and a bit disorganized, but in a very charming way.  You can tell that everyone there was very concerned that every guest was happy.  The location isn't the greatest, but any True BBQ lover will not let that get in the way of the only True southern cooking I've had in the 8 years I have lived here.  I am very excited to try more items on their menu.  I can't wait to go back.  Thank you for easing some of my homesickness.",

    "text": "One word:  Legit.  Being a southerner at heart and also from the DC area - this place is as close as I'm going to get to some straight up dirty BBQ in Vegas.  I would go to this place just to smell the beautiful, and oh so addictive smells and then head off on my merry way.  Mmmmhmmm.  I have to mention the cornbread right away.  No BBQ joint would be official without some fresh cornbread.  They've got it right and tight!  So right, that I ordered a ton of extra to-go for a party I was attending later in the night.  Even more right, that I asked for a sample while ordering..  Sad, but very True.  With all the smells, I was a little overwhelmed on what to order.  I had my sides figured out, but my main plate was hard to pinpoint.  I was experiencing one of those \"eyes are bigger than your stomach\" moments..  Oh wells.  After jostling the idea of ribs around for a few, I kept it real and went with the Beef Brisket.  Ribs are tricky and I'm incredibly picky, so I needed to start slow.  :)  No regrets there.  Flavorful and plenty to eat for leftovers.  They offer a few selections on the amount of grub you order, which was neat in my book.  Now, back to the ribs...  They have a variety to choose from cooked according to whatever region in the states.  Loved that!   Next trip:  RIBS!  As far as sides go, I was also a little overwhelmed in this department as well.   Never overwhelmed in a bad way.  I went all out with the fattiest of the bunch and had the Mac 'n' Cheese, Loaded Mash Potatoes and the Bacon Potato Salad.  Yes, BACON.  POTATO.  SALAD.  #WINNING!  The service was friendly and they even complimented me on being so small but yet ordering so much.  \"Is this all for you?\"  \"Hell yeah it is.. C'mon now!\"    Coolest part about this joint (other than the food, of course):  They deliver AND offer party packages where they'll actually wheel their smoker to your party and hook....you....up!   Whaaaaa?!   Rollin Smoke has my foodie heart forevs!    **This is a popular joint, which means.. lines, lines, lines.  Try to skip the food rush and go during a slower time of the day!  Don't get me wrong though, the long lines are worth it in the end.",

Both the indoor and outdoor dining areas were clean.  The food didn't  quite match up to the expectations, sadly. The burger was pretty dry and the peach cobbler was pretty sad. The brisket was above average, but you could tell that the ribs had been sitting for a while.   Five stars for the service! Our server was attentive, helpful, and very friendly!   We're going to try again when they aren't so busy. Hopefully we just caught them on a bad night.",

The burnt ends were to die for. The meats melted in our mouths. The mac and cheese was good but watery. I wasn't a fan of the hush puppies. The place is quaint, the service was fast, the people were very kind. Finally, a place I will revisit.",

This place also has a very good sauce.  It ranks better than anything in Utah, and you have to go to Texas to find something better.

When I asked why, she said \"I don't know I just put in what you told me and that's how much it is\" ...then I said I wanted to change my order and she said it's already been made???  So then we get the food and it was TERRIBLE, baby back ribs should just fall off the bone, these were tough and a bit dry and the BBQ sauce was just not tasty at all...the cornbread tasted \"ok\" but was completely soggy on the bottom... Overall the service was bad, the food was bad and the restaurant was dirty, I guess I came in on the wrong day or ordered the wrong thing or everyone else is taking crazy pills???",

Wanting to try several things and leave my options open, I went for the $25 All you can eat.  It is not buffet, don;t worry, they ask want you want to start with and bring you more of anything on the menu.  I started with the brisket, pork ribs and the beef ribs my friend could not stop taking about.   These are not your normal small, barely any meat back ribs, these are short ribs, and contrary to the name, they are not short or small. These are the \"Dino Ribs\" and full of tender flavor. Enough of that, the Beef ribs were among the best I had, the brisket was a lean cut, I wish I asked for the moist / fatty , not sure if they have it, but that is what I try to get.  I found this brisket to be pretty good, tender & flavorful, I just prefer mine from \"The Point\" The Spareribs had a great flavor, the right 'bite', you do not want fall off the bone, many may think that, but the best have a bit of bite, but are also tender.  These were so. The service was great, the guy that took my order was patient, he may be the owner, not sure, but worked with me on my order to make sure I got want I wanted.  The servers brought out my food promptly and since I had the all you can eat, they refilled me with more brisket beef ribs at my request.",

All were good but I have had better in terms of texture (a little on a dry side for me) and a little on the flavor (minus 1 star). The really got the smokey part down where the brisket leaves the deep red rim below the charred tip.  For sides we got: corn nuggets -  which was yummy as I never had something like it collard greens - i loved it as it wasn't too greasy or cooked with bacon. Instead they used pieces of the smoked brisket to cook it in. Delicious and less guilty to eat. fried okra - never thought this was good but it actually was.  I wanted corn on a cob as one of the sides but they didn't have any which is the first I've heard at a bbq but since their other choices are good, i wont complain.   Cost: Very descent. For our 4 choice sampler, 3 small sides and a soda to share ALL for $19.99!! I'm happy with that!   Seating: Majority are in a big benches. Which you may have to share if it gets crowded. So for some you don't like sharing go when its not prime time or learn to be people friendly.   Parking: Good amounts of parking but not a lot. Location is good for the boys who loves strip clubs because this bbq joint is near and surrounded by most of them.",

    "text": "Wow!  Smokin!  OK, I must say I really like this place a lot and for a barbecue joint, it is the highest review I can give.   a. Location - WTF, I felt like I was driving to one of those back alley strip joints or toward that Erotic Museum.  However, I must say, driving there from the 15 Freeway was very easy!  Just in a very dingy area is all.  b.  Size - They must have increased size,  as I was expecting a really small place with like three tables and they seemed to have expanded next door with some bench like tables to sit good size parties.  I would say though, that the max they can have in this place is like 9-10 parties of various size.  c.  Menu - Pretty darn awesome if you ask me.  Simple to order and if you like meats you can make your own combo from the duo, trio or the Pit Special with a bunch of different meats. They even have large party size orders on the menu.  The brisket was great, the beef ribs darn good. I always order baby back pork ribs so these beef ribs were the right size and very tasty.  I loved the hot links and I did not care so much for the pulled pork, a bit dry if you ask me.    d.  Hot Sauce - On the table were two types of sauces, and neither was too hot.  I did use quite a bit on the pulled pork. I generally like a hot sauce. I did not ask them, and I wonder if they have it.  e.  Friendly - The owners and workers here are all very friendly, ask about their food and they want you to enjoy your experience.  That is such a cool added touch!  f.  Ordering, drinking and etc - You order at the front and pay, but they bring the food to you.  The soda fountain and the ice tea area are in a small and tight area, so if it is busy, it will be tough to get to.   g. Leftovers - They plenty of serve yourself plastics for any leftovers you have.  h.  The sides - Plenty of sides.  The potato salad was awesome. The beans were great, the corn nuggets were totally cool.  These were the only sides we had.  Results - Awesome finger licking food, great pricing and great service.  Loved it better than Famous Dave's and Lucille's. GK says check it out.",

    "text": "July 21, 2014:  11:15 AM  Imagine waking up at one of the best hotels on the Las Vegas Strip and you've just had a great meal at a famous chef's restaurant the night before, but you're wondering what the locals eat.  You're wondering if a town like Las Vegas has local places that most tourists don't know exist.  If you're like me, you go to the source, Yelp, for good information, and Yelp came through in a great way.  On this date we found Rollin Smoke Barbeque, and it was a good, make that great, find.  It is a hole in the wall joint tucked into a strip mall off the beaten path, and, as of this review, it was averaging 4.5 stars after 455 Yelp reviews.  This is a very good thing, as Yelpers can be unkind and unforgiving on occasion.  Typically I look for consensus when using Yelp, and that is usually achieved after 100 or so reviews.  On our trip there were three of us arriving, my wife, my sister in law, and me.  Of the three, I was the most committed to the experience, and the other two were good sports.  After the food arrived, they were also sold.  We ordered so that we could try almost everything, as we got enough to share with each other.  We had beef ribs, pork ribs, chicken, jalapeno cole slaw, beans, potato salad, and, as its two days since we were there, I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  We also 'checked in' on Yelp, and when we did this they offered us a free desert.  We chose the blueberry cobbler.  If you are 'high maintenance' this is not a place for you.  You order like you're at Carl's Junior; stand in line, place the order, give them your name, find a seat, and they bring it out to you.  The room does not feature fancy table clothes or fine silver.  It does include a plethora of paper towels (on a roll for your immediate use), and a TV tuned to a sports channel.  In the room with us was a crew of air conditioning repair men, about ten guys, and the fact that they were there, locals, helped me know that this not a tourist spot, but a local's place.  The $40 worth of food that we ordered literally arrived in about four minutes.  It is important to note that we had attempted to avoid any kind of lunch rush, arriving before the lunch hour.  There were probably 10 other people already there, and I suspect that the lunch hour features a lengthy line.  Regrets?  Yes, just one.  I wanted to taste one of their links, but I didn't get the chance, but next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get one.  Las Vegas is many things, and there are a lot of really great places to eat, and, as in all big towns, there are some great locations off The Strip that you've got to find, and Rollin Smoke Barbeque is on that list.",

    "text": "My husband and I have had the hardest time finding a good BBQ place in Vegas...until now.   When you get out of your car and walk up to the door you are immediately hit with the most wonderful smell. Ordering happens at the cashier up front and the wait wasn't bad but considering that we went on a Saturday around 11:30am it probably gets incredibly busy later in the afternoon.   The lady taking our order was super friendly and she recommended trying the burnt edges brisket. They do have an up charge and I am not sure how much but it was totally worth it. I ordered the combo two meat plate: burnt edges brisket & chicken and for my side I choose the corn nuggets.   My husband got sliced brisket & chicken and his sides were Mac & cheese and collards.   The burnt edges were so delicious and I can confidently say way better then the sliced version. I would pass on the collards and the chicken. The collards were too salty for my taste and the chicken was dry. However, the Mac and cheese and the corn nuggets were excellent.   We will be back from some more burnt edges brisket and Mac&Cheese!",

    "text": "One of our best finds this time on our trip to LV.  You know when food is good when you eat it at 1030 am and find yourself still talking about it at 10 pm at night! Amazing food. Juicy, tender and flavorful. Hubby had AYCE ...yes they do have that option for only $34.95. Fantastic deal as most buffet cost more than that in town.  The food here is brought to u as you order additional servings and not under heat lamps. My 3 kids and I shared the Rib plate with additional one beef rib and side of nuggets and  banana puddings.  They were so delicious but if I had to pick one meat....beef rib wound be it.  I dont like bananas but the pudding  got me hooked after I hesitantly tasted it that the kids asked I order another one since I ate it all.  Ooopss :).  More than enough food.   I think what is equally memorable @Rollin smoke BBQ is the customer service.  Not too many people can WOW me, but this team did.  Exceptional! Greeted personally and immediately as you step through the door.  Offered help to order if you needed it which I did. Christian was...an employee you want to hire for our business.  As matter fact..I would hire them all. They were crosstrained to do all off it.  Kudos to the management team.   As I sat eating, whether the staff was taking orders, delivering food to the table, making our icecream floats, going to eat table checking on customers or wiping off tables, they did it with a smile.  You can sense how genuine they were to want your experience at the place a great one.  A few customers including myself asked for forks and extra plates not knowing they were on a side table with all the sauces for the taking.  Since we were seated, Christian and his team would not only point to where the items were, they would say \" no. don't get up.  I would be happy to get it for you.\"  You would have items on your table immediately. I felt silly for not seeing it as the dining room wasn't big but hthe staff genuinely didnt want me to have to get up... I mean such attentive service despite them being sooo  busy.   Food delivered quick and hot.  The staff cleans off the tables quick.  The staff truly have this down to a science.  A Definite \"you must try this place\". No disappointment here :)  Never walked out of a restaurant feeling \"pampered.\" Lol!!!  Eventhough not your traditional buffet, it has got to be our favorite. I encourage customers to tip the staff.  I did as they truly provide 5 star quality service.",

I had no hope of eating all this food, but it gave me a good cross section of the menu.  For the meats - 1.  Brisquit - nice smoke flavor, good texture, but too dry for my taste.  2. Spareribs - nice smoke flavor, good texture, needs no sauce to be enjoyed - my favorite of the 4.  3.  Beef rib - beautiful bark, good texture, flavor was good, but needed sauce to be enjoyed.  4.  Last and certainly least was the chicken.  It was all dark, so I had high hopes, but I found it over cooked, dry (for a thigh) and pretty flavorless.  I can't recommend the chicken at all.  3 Sides - 1.  Kicken beans - not bad, but I am spoiled by Jack Stack beans in Kansas City - none other has so far come close.  2.  Bacon potato salad - just ok, a bit bland for me.  3.  Side salad with Chipotle dressing - my favorite side.  I would give this place 3.5 stars when compared to the other bbq I have had.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for our honeymoon and asked some locals about where a good place for decent priced food was.  It was hard to find, but once we found it we were thrilled!  We are from Texas, so we know BBQ.  I had the outlaw burger which was HUGE!  We should have just split it.  It had almost a meatloaf texture, but it tasted smoked and I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  My husband had a full rack of baby back ribs and they were as big as the beef ribs we are used to.  They were fall off the bone tender and we couldn't finish them.  We are big eaters but after this lunch, we skipped dinner.  The owners friend was the cook and he came out and talked with us.  He was super helpful on giving us pointers on what to order and what else to do while we were in town.  Everyone was nice and the food was great.  (it's three weeks later and I'm wishing we could go back for more).",

The staff is always polite and helpful and their recommendations are pretty on point. The macaroni and cheese and potato salad aren't quite up to par with the rest of the menu.

They are \"DAMN GOOD!!!\" The pictures of course do not do it justice. I get my combo. $13 well spent. This is all you really need if you're a beef rib connoisseur. They give you two Gangster Sized Ribs, a side (mine was the bacon potato salad), a slider bun, and a tasty cool beverage to wash it all down with on tap. The best DAMN BEEF RIBS I've ever had! They were freaken GIANORMOUS!!! Fall off the bone tender. I easily cut them off the bone and it looked like I had two big steaks. I cut off one nice slice and made a rib slider with the bun. I usually don't have trouble finishing my ribs, but these were like BRONTOSAURUS RIBS off of the Flintstones! FOR REALLY DOE!!!  Great service, great place to sit your phat @$$ to chow down, and AMAZING B.B.Q. Rollin Smoke B.B.Q. is blowing up. Keep up the great work guys!!! Will be back soon.

I found this place doing a search for \"Best BBQ in Vegas\" and this was a top contender.  I ordered the Brisket sliders with BBQ beans & my husband ordered the Brisket and mashed potatoes. A friend of ours ordered the ribs. My daughter just ordered a hot dog and Mac n cheese as she's not a huge BBQ fan. (Weird kid) The brisket itself was pretty good. The BBQ sauce wasn't that great at all though.  I would pass on the sliders because the bread was so greasy that I ended up just taking the meat out and tossing the bread. The beans were great. A bit spicy, but I love spice. The Mac and cheese & the cornbread were pretty good also.  Overall, it was good. I can't say for sure if we'd go back or not the next time we're in Vegas, as I think we'll continue our search for amazing BBQ places (which by the way, the most amazing BBQ place is in Austin!)",

The aroma of meat tended in a loving way greets you upon approach, beckoning you to come inside and choose your savory adventure. Luckily, we had 5 adults in our party, so we had occasion to order the sampler and try EVERYTHING. Best. Day. Ever.   All of it was good. The meat could stand on its own, prepared to perfection. Smoky in flavor, and complimented (not masked) by the accompanying BBQ sauce. The fried catfish was perfect; no soggy breading, beautiful sauces on the side, just right. We tried the spicy sample. Some laughed. Some cried.   In a day when chain BBQ is the norm, finding a gem like this feels like discovering Atlantis. You can tell the people running this business love their work because both the chef and the servers asked how we were liking the food and toured the dining room to ensure the same with other guests.   10/10 for THE BEST BBQ in LV, 10/10 for the service and welcoming atmosphere - will DEFINITELY come here again.",

    "text": "Rollin' Smoke has been getting a lot of online press the past few months and I finally got a chance to try them out. The raves are correct. The place is amazing. It is by far the best barbecue in Vegas and some of the best I've had anywhere.  When you pull up into the parking lot, you can see the smokers outside. When you walk in, the smell of barbecue is in the air. The place is inviting and the staff (and owners) are very nice and genuinely proud of their food.  I got the trio platter for $13.99 which includes three meats, a side, and a fountain drink. I chose pork spare ribs (ribs+tips attached), beef brisket, and pulled pork, with mac&cheese as my side. You get two spare ribs as an item in the trio. Other choices were 1/4 chicken or links. It's quite a deal!  The pork spare ribs are amazing. Meaty, well-seasoned, great smoke ring, and the flavor was unbelievable. The brisket was quite good and the pulled pork was tender and flavorful. I wish I would have eaten the brisket and pulled pork before the spare ribs though, because the more delicate flavor of those meats was overtaken by the taste of the ribs.  Midway through my meal, I heard someone order a beef rib. I LOVE beef ribs and it's very rare that a barbecue place serves them. So I had to get that too. $6.99 for a rib, but completely worth it. It is intensely beefy in flavor and gets more and more juicy as you eat it. Sort of tough on the outside, but near the bone it was beyond anything I could have hoped for.  I was so impressed that I was texting my friends all through my meal. I ended up ordering almost $100 of barbecue to take back to my friends. It has been a week now, but my phone still smells like barbecue. One of my friends ordered some smoked hot links, so I got to try that as well and they are really good. I usually scoff at ordering links at a barbecue place, but these were special.  All told, I tried every meat on their menu except for the chicken and the smoked meat loaf. The pork spare ribs take home the ribbon, but everything else was not far behind. My friend's beef ribs did look much smaller than the one I got and he said it was dry all the way through, so ask for a big hefty one to make sure it's tender.  For side dishes, I would not recommend the mac&cheese. It wasn't that good. Other tables had jalapeno cole slaw, bacon potato salad, fried okra, and hush puppies. All those seemed to be well-liked.  The barbecue sauce is made in-house and is very good. It might be very slightly too sweet for my liking, but I order my barbecue with sauce on the side anyway, so I didn't mind much. They also make a spicy barbecue sauce which you can request.  Oh, they also have a buffet option. For $25, you get unlimited everything on their menu. If you like beef ribs, two beef ribs are $15. Eating four beef ribs and a side already puts you ahead.",

    "text": "HANG UP THE PHONE! I found this total hole in the wall on Yelp, and BOY Im glad I did!  Hubbys from Texas and cant find decent brisket here despite many a valiant effort.   Until now. Heres the scoop:  This place is tucked behind a strip joint in the seedy area behind the mirage on highland drive.    In fact, if you're squeamish about going to the hood, you may want to come at lunch time rather than dinner.   If youre from out of town, dont expect much in the way of atmosphere. The decor is minimal. There are six tables total in the small front room, and maybe 6 or 8 inthe small side room.  .   This place belongs on diners drive ins and dives for sure.   Service was ok. At times we had to wait a few minutes for servers to emerge from the kitchen. However, When they werent cooking, they were polite & personable.  Despite all of this, the rating is five stars for the food alone.   This food really is off the hook.   1. Biggest beef ribs ive ever seen and thats not an exaggeration. 8oz of beef on each one at least. Sooo tender .& juicy, and the sauce was perfect  2. Best brisket in town, hands down. TENDER, MOIST, unlike at every other wannabe bbq place in town.   3. The fried okra was the best ive had this side of the mississippi, OR north of the mason-dixon line. I dont like okra if its not perfectly cooked. This was. I was frankly shocked!   4. Jalapeno coleslaw was very good if a bit hot!  5. Blackberry cobbler was pretty good. I enjoyed it.   Portions are good sized & filling.  Note: Theres a soda machine tucked in an alcove thats hard to find. At first we thought all they had to drink was sweet tea with no ice lol  In short: if youre from the south and are craving authentic bbq, this place is worth the trip. Oh, and the prices are HALF that of lucilles bbq. Five stars!",

    "text": "If you do not want to go all the bbq places and more of a mom and pop feel, definitely a must try for people out of town. An awesome bbq spot for locals as well who love bbq.   So this place is located minutes away from the strip and you probably would not be able to find it, not unless you drive by a lot near the S Highland area. I actually randomly got this as one of the places to try, so as usual, my fiance and I were curious. After looking at the pictures and with the reviews we had to check this place out.   We arrived around 2pm, and luckily there was no line, and the lunch crowd was gone. As you walk in, there are two doors. One door appears to lead to the back section of the establishment, and the other door leads you to the register and main dining area. They have lots of room to eat, however during peak time you probably can imagine to come when they are not busy.   The menu: pretty extensive and lots to choose from. What I loved about the menu was being able to choose from 3 meat to 5 meat, and boom the ONLY bbq place in Vegas that does all you can eat bbq for $35. Their sides also were awesome ranging from the waffle fries down to their bacon potato salad. Their drinks, oh my, they had Kool-Aid not just for the kids, but for those adults who grew up with it. Prepare to be brought back to your happy place down your childhood memory lane. Last, but not least, the desserts, fairly priced, and nothing but that southern hospitality to top the icing on the cake. They have peach cobbler and banana pudding!   What we ordered: after long contemplation, we decided to have the 5 piece meat. This is The Pit, on the menu (contains: chicken, hot links, ribs, brisket, and pulled pork) and you pick 3 sides. We got the collard greens, bacon potato salad, and the waffle fries. They were extremely fast and attentive, which makes the experience better. After waiting for a good 15-20 minutes our food was brought out.   The taste: 5/5 omg the ribs, by far the most juiciest, yet tender, and perfectly seasoned you do not even have to put their house made bbq sauce on it. Although, you can add the sweet country girl sauce to it to add a sweet kick and some tanginess it. This honestly makes you want to try the all you can eat. The brisket and pulled pork, tender and smoked to perfection. Hot links, spicy and juicy all around. The chicken, it was juicy, only thing is it could of been cooked longer and possibly a bigger portion. As for the sides, the waffle fries were awesome. Almost had a Cajun seasoning taste to it and you can never go wrong with these. The collard greens was 3/5, I was hoping for more bacon grease to add that I cannot stop eating feeling. The bacon potato salad, 3/5, it had that egg taste, with a little bacon and I think the bacon overwhelmed the taste of the actual potato salad. Possibly, more onions and a hint of relish would of made it more mouth watering! Loved the concept as no one cannot day no when you see bacon and potato salad all in one.   Overall, great first time experience! Hoping to be back as we were unable to try the dessert and want to try the all you can eat. Hats off to the cooks in the kitchen, as it can be hard to please two people who love to eat and love bbq. See you soon!",

We went this morning around 1030am. Not crowded since they had just opened up, but by the time we left the people were starting to roll in. Now for the actual review:  GOOD - the beef rib was very tender and had very good flavor. They just pulled off the bone just right. Ordered a side of collard greens and enjoyed the flavor and texture. They had various flavors of coolaid to choose from which was neat. Plenty of different sauces you can try. Portion size was pretty good. Not massive, but a good value.   BAD - Now the part that pains me to talk about. The special came with pork spare ribs which were dry. Not a little dry, but borderline dried out. I sauced the heck out of it, and it did not help. I am slightly perplexed since the beef ribs came out very good. I'm going to assume the pitmaster had an off day on the pork ribs. If thats the case, they should not have served them.   The cups they give you to put bbq sauce in are very small. If they had med size ones that would have made things easier rather than filling up a bunch of small ones.  OVERALL - I would come back again. I would give the pork ribs another try. Overall, very good service, clean and food was good(excluding the pork ribs). Highlight is the customer service and friendliness.",

Glad we made the right choice. Ordered the Pitt and it was so delicious, beyond words. Perfectly smoked ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork, hot links, and chicken... all tasty and perfect. Not forgetting their sauces, my favorite was a mixture of vinegar and spicy sauce as well as the sweet country girl. Sides were green beans, smokin bean, and waffle fries. Service was excellent, friendly staffs, and fast. Not to mention, their Arkansas special housemade dessert, cherry coke berries with nuts was marvelous, my first time having it. A definite come back place in Vegas.",

The side of green beans aren't southern styled but more fresh green beans with salt. They have tea options (but no Splenda - my favorite). You cannot leave without a dessert - I ordered the banana pudding. Pro Tip: Flavor the meat with the complementary BBQ sauces.",

You order at the counter and food is brought out to your table.   I ordered the 5 chicken wings in the spicy sauce. They're whole wings so it's quite a large serving. The Wong's don't come with sides but you can order those separately. The one regret I have is not asking how spicy it was, she asked if I wanted buffalo but I opted for the spicy. Now I know why she asked lol. The spicy is reaaaallllyyy spicy. I could only eat 2 wings. It was good but holy hot!  And I eat spicy. My thai food orders are usually a 8 out of 10 or 4 out of 5. I order everything hot. If I come back I will not be ordering the spicy, it's way beyond what I can handle.   The bf ordered 3 meat plate. Baby back ribs, hot links and pulled pork. They were all very good. I had a nibble of each. The side of Mac was also very delicious. I had to steal his slice of bread because my mouth was on fire lol.   I love all the sauces in the side. The vinegar is great on the pork, the mustard base one was great on the wings and the Arkansas was good on everything. Regardless of the lava level spice on the wings it was still very good.",

    "text": "Firstly, I'm NOT a foodie, but I have good taste. I'm picky and rarely crave things. BBQ has typically been good once every couple weeks for me but I've never had any BBQ in Las Vegas that wowed me like Rollin Smoke did/does. I literally have dreamt about it. Woke up earlier today and my mouth was watering from thinking about it, and I can't remember that happening in years. I do enjoy good food; can't stand fast food more than once or twice a month and generally the only meats I really eat on a regular basis is beef, chicken and turkey. Not huge on veggies unless they're prepared well. Anyways, on my first visit I ordered the chopped brisket and the 1/4 white chicken with loaded mash, fried corn nuggets (I think that's what they're called), mac n cheese, and cornbread. Everything was unbelievable. I went back a couple days later to make sure it was really as good as I thought and it was at least as good as (or better) on the second visit, I think because I was more familiar and confident with the menu. The superb rating score and reviews are completely accurate. It's a little expensive but it is incredible worth it. It does close a little early on the weekdays as well, but I'm a little bias because I work nights/grave and am typically eating my first meal of the day around 3-4pm so it's hard for me to catch a REAL full meal there, except on the weekends when I can come in at 9:30 and not feel too bad about being the last customer. More specific on the food: (just because I don't mention something DOES NOT mean it wasn't exceptional, I'm just elaborating on the few things that completely blew my mind...) The brisket was equal to, or better than any I've ever had (I'm a world traveler and been everywhere that is worth going to) and the cornbread was without a doubt, the best I've ever had. The corn nuggets also deserve an extra mention as well. Even though I'm not very adventurous, I'm thinking that I could probably order anything here and love it. I'm sure I'll try other items on my upcoming visits, as Rollin Smoke probably is now officially in my exclusive 'twice a week minimum' rotation. If you're really hungry and haven't been there before, the \"All You Can Eat\" for like $35 is probably a good choice, as you can try any and everything and $35 is really only about $10-12 more than you would spend on one of their smaller meals. IF YOU'RE A LOCAL, MENTION IT AND GET A DISCOUNT !! Also if you have an event to cater and BBQ is an option... Rollin Smoke will make an extremely good impression and will be the star of the show. And their stuff doesn't get cold quick and lose its texture like so many restaurants that cater. I can't think of a better place to cater a non-formal event.   By the way, I don't write many reviews. Only the absolute BEST OF THE BEST, or any horrendous experiences that have no possibility of redemption. But I'm seriously mad at myself for not trying Rollin Smoke sooner. I've been wasting my life away (hah)",

    "text": "Located on a street lined with strip joints and tucked away from the strip lies amazingly delicious BBQ at Rollin Smoke BBQ. Service is so warm and friendly here. The way it works is that you order your food and then they bring it to you.  There's also an all-you-can-eat option, which is characteristically Vegas! There's no limit in the all-you-can-eat option. You can eat anything that's on the menu -- bbq, burgers, sides, etc. I couldn't bring myself to do it, so I opted for the three combo plate. It comes with one side and I just added another two more.  It was a hearty meal shared between two. The baby back ribs were an extra charge but we had to do it. It was smoky, flavorful, and tender. Rollin Smoke has bottles of homemade bbq sauce. There was a sweet and spicy one that I really liked but can't remember the name of!   We also got brisket. I ordered it chopped because you get the option of chopped or sliced. Looking back, I wish I got sliced because the chopped brisket was more so shredded brisket. I wish I was able to have some more texture to my brisket! Nonetheless, still good.  We also got hot links, which were nice and spicy. The sides we got were mac and cheese, corn nuggets, and potato salad. The potato salad was okay. The corn nuggets and mac and cheese, however, were so delicious! I am a mac and cheese aficionado and I want to steal their mac and cheese recipe. It was so cheesy, creamy, and satisfying! The corn nuggets were deep fried creamed corn. They might've been my favorite side order! I highly recommend their mac and cheese and corn nuggets. I don't know where else I can get my corn nuggets craving.  This will definitely be a routine stop whenever I am in Vegas! If you love bbq, you've got to try this place out!",

    "text": "The best BBQ I've had in Vegas.  Truth be told, I haven't had many options, nor do I think I want to; nonetheless this place is really good.  I typically judge a place by their beef ribs. Yes it's tough to screw up because it's such a great cut, but these guys do it right.  It's so tender and fall off the bone, but still holds it's shape.  Their sliced brisket is just as tender.  The hot links is always a favorite of mine.  Whether they make it in-house or not (not sure), it's still good.  The space is a little weird, stand in line, then find a picnic table to get your meat on.  The sauces are good, I like the spicy.  They compliment the bbq really well without being overwhelming.    I've had bbq all over the country and this is definitely one of the best I've ever had.",

There is a small parking lot and plenty of street parking.  We ordered the platter that contained chicken, ribs, pulled pork, Tri tip ends, and 2 sides. We were able to share between my wife and I. The meat fell off the bone and was super tender. For our 4 meals and 4 drinks  it came out to a little over $100. Food was delicious! W all had left overs since the portions are pretty big.",

Look i was just galavanting doing life, i was gon' get right back. Anyways no introduction needed, but you in the presence of Soapy Knuckles whatever whatevers, aka Brisket Baron Davis, aka Steak Fries Steelo, aka the Baby Back Boss Hawg back with that heat rock for ya and today we talkin Rollin' Smoke BBQ in Vegas.  First off this joint not on the strip, so to get there i had to cross the red sea, commune with a tibetian monk, and solve like 50eleven riddles just to grace their doorway with my presencr. Once you get there tho, aint no games are to be played. You know this place real cause all the cats who work their look they been through some thangs in life, and put all that love, heartbreak, triumph, and disappointment into the meat they chef up for you. I don't want to taste no ones bbq that aint been the storm and the rain. Every bite of the rib tips felt like an intrusion into a therapy session... but like a session where they had delicious life changing bbq, and overly accommodating people.   I got the trio-meat plate, which was wild ambitious cause between the beef rib, spare ribs, rib tips, and greens w/brisket i didnt have room for my peach cobbler (but you damn right i ate it, cause momma aint raise no quitter). The best thing was the rib tips, the fat to meat ratio was perfect, cause literally felt like you threw it in your mouth and it started melting. The sauce? Pro tip: Mix the arkansas sweet and the spicy, i call it the femme fatale. It does a fantastic job of letting the meat talk that cash, but also making a statement on its own. The beef rib tasted like dreams fulfilled. Like if you could be Tom Brady for a day... minus the butt chin and being unable to dance and being a cheater and having to live in Boston... okay so nothing like Tom Brady, but you get the point.   This is what two straight 5 Durag reviews from me? *checks to see if Trump still in office* nope, nevermind im not dreaming and neither are you. Look man, i had to come through and give yall something to chew on. Go there, eat it all and tell em the Villainous one sent you.  #VillainsVittles   Score: 5 out of 5 shimmering durags.

We wanted to eat somewhere that's savory, delicious, and popular of course! We originally saw this place on YouTube, through a food blogger. There's an option for \"all you can eat\" bbq, since Las Vegas is known for that right? At first, my boyfriend wanted to try AYCE, but after seeing the portion size, he opted out, lol!  Let's get started with the portion, they do not skip on the meat! Our baskets were fully loaded and made fresh to order. I ordered the baby back ribs, which fell off the bone. My boyfriend ordered the burnt ends, which had a nice char and crunch to them. Our sides were corn nuggets (these were so good! ), corn bread, yams, and criss cut fries.   The yams were sweet and delicious, makes my mouth water just thinking about them. The corn bread was soft and packed with flavor. The fries, not as crunchy as I thought they would be, but still good. Now, the corn nuggets...I've never had them before but everyone loves them and now I see why. They tasted amazing! My taste buds were in heaven!  We tried all of the sauces with our bbq, but the Mama Sweet sauce really stuck out. The blend of sweet and savory hit it home.  In summary, we would DEFINITELY come back if we were ever in Vegas again. Make this your last spot to stop at before leaving!",

Now it's expected that a barbeque establishment would have a number of sticky, somewhat dirty decor, but this place was at least a little bit more than that.  Very little cleaning up happens here and everything looked like a big hot mess.    Service was decent, although a bit slow for a night that didn't have a lot going on.  They were starting to close up however so I wouldn't ding them too harshly for having a likely busier part of their day that they're recovering from.  As for the sides, and rest of what was offered.  The sweet tea was a letdown since it was sweetened tea, not sweet tea.  The sweet corn cornbread was decent, along with the mac & cheese and other items, but it didn't wow me.    The ribs though, I may come back and endure to at least have another taste of that. I will definitely try this again and give it another shot, and maybe change my original first impression on the venue.  Oh yeah, the sauces were forgettable.",

I was getting dirty looks on my flight back because all 250 of them could smell the smoked chicken, brisket, ribs, corn bread and Mac n cheese.....  I wanted to scout a place off strip as I do with all my trips to bring back some good local food home. Something which isn't available in the DC area. BBQ, no good or even average places in/near DC. So once I heard about this place being featured on Travel Channel and highly rated on Yelp I decided this is it. I got about everything on the menu from meatloaf to brisket and dirty rice to baked beans.  The brisket was wonderful but it definitely needs the sauce which they provide. The chicken is the best I've had. Forget about Peruvian chicken.... Even the best Peruvian chicken in DC can't hold its own. The beef rib was a dry rub which was also moist and had a nice kick. The meatloaf was wow, all meat. The dirty rice was spicy and the Mac and cheese was epic. The corn bread was fantastic too. Definitely do yourself a favor, step off that tourist trap (the strip) and give this place a go!!",

Family of 5 we spent $75 here on lunch (and my husband and I even shared a meal). Kinda crazy for a place where you aren't served.   Overall we really enjoyed it here!

The cashier told us about something (I can't remember the name but it's 5 meats and 3 sides) which sounded perfect for two people! We got the meats and it was like 3 ribs, pulled pork, chopped up brisket, chicken, and sausage. The sausage was perfect. It was spicy, but not too much to where you can't taste it. The flavor in that was amazing! The pulled pork was so damn tender and fell apart perfectly. Brisket is normally dry when I go to other places and it's always chopped into big awkward pieces but I love how small these were cut because it savored alllll the juices. Now what's better than juicy brisket?! And finally the chicken was the least dry chicken I've ever had!   Now for the sides....  The Mac n cheese, my only complaint was that I wish the cheese on top was melted but other than that it was delicious. It was so creamy and amazing. We also got the mashed potatoes. It had bacon so it was automatically amazing so there's that. And the corn nuggets were so good for something so simple.   To top it off, as we were leaving the owners mom was talking to me and she's so sweet and amazing. She's so proud of her son and does anything to help him. I felt the love through the food as well. I can't wait to be back. I found my favorite bbq place in Vegas!",

Location is in a run down shopping center and not a frequently used street for the local but aren't all the good places like that? It was a place you order and grab your seat. They offer an ample amount of picnic bench seating so don't worry about a rush and not having a place to sit. Just think you can make friends with someone new. I got here around noon on a Friday. I just beat the rush. But as I said don't let that steer you away; quick and efficient service.  I ordered the duo plate; chopped brisket, hot links, mac & cheese and an order of hush puppies. My mouth is watering thinking about this meal again. There was so much flavor in every bit. My favorite was the brisket though. The hot links definitely had some kick to it so be sure to stock up on your sweet tea beverage. Hush puppies are like no others I ever had. They have jalapenos in them! Oh and I forgot the corn bread. This was like dessert, no butter or honey needed. It was almost like the consistency of a pound cake and never once crumbled.  The part that always gets me & deserves that extra star is seeing the chefs come out asking how everything was.  Always puts a smile on my face seeing how much pride they have in their cooking. A must try off the strip restaurant!",

After a few minutes, I ordered the Brisket 3 Ways, which came out pretty quick after ordering. The brisket was down right amazing. My favorite was between the chopped and burnt ends. Makes me hungry just thinking about it... I got the Mac n Cheese as my side, also delicious. Pretty much nothing fancy, just Meat and Mac n Cheese. As for the food, probably the best BBQ I've had. The location kinda sucks but it is close to work so I guess that's a plus. The only drawback that I can think of is the price. It was $21 after tax for my lunch. It wouldn't be a place I would go every day or else I would be broke, but definitely the place to go if you have an itch for delicious BBQ.",

I got a bottle of water, pay attention to the label it gives you 10% off the next meal! There's seating inside and outside. The customer service was great!

And love all their bbq sauces I combined the hot links, cole slaw and pulled pork and made a delicious sandwich.  Cole slaw was great Not a fan of the waffle fries Corn nuggets were good but you can't eat too much of them. Dirty rice tastes like rice pilaf (won't order this again)",

I love all of the great reviews people was giving this place. So we decided to go. This is after our 1st dart tournament that took so long to get started.   When we got there a nice small place. We enter inside got in line to place our order looking at the menu a lot of good stuff. The loaded baked potato looked really good. Me & my bf decided to get the pit plate. It comes with spare ribs, brisket, pulled pork,  half chicken plus 3 sides. Which we got mac & cheese, corn bread, & bacon potato.  It didn't take long for our order it came out the minute we sat down. I got the chicken it was very tend & moist I love the skin of the chicken then the ribs was good too. But the best of the best of everything was their mac & cheese. It was so damn cheesy & creamy. I loved it so much. Plus the corn bread was super moist & soft.  I couldn't finish all of my food it was so much left. So we box it all & took it back to our room to have for our next day dart tournament. Overall this is a great place to have some bbq. A mus to place to go.",

Found in a strip mall behind all the casinos and strip joints, you would never guess this place is serving up delicious BBQ! One of the best BBQ experience I've had. Walked in and I was immediately engulfed by the sweet smell of BBQ smoke. I bellied up to the counter and looked over the menu. They have all your typical BBQ meats - brisket, chicken, pork, ribs, and hot links - however the taste is definitely not typical! They have sandwiches, plates, and even an AYCE option! I ordered the 3 meat plate (brisket, pork, and hot links) with 2 sides (jalapeno cole slaw, hush puppies) and corn bread. Everything was delicious! There are bottles of BBQ sauce on the tables if you wish to add.The sauce was excellent  You have to try #RSBBQ next time you're in #Vegas!",

Shout out to the Chef (think Chef Tim) who is absolutely wonderful, personable, and friendly.  \"Heads up\" If you like beer with your BBQ, you'll be disappointed to find that one of the locations (bigger one) does not have a bar or sell alcohol.

I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a \"Smoked Brisket Sandwich\" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of \"Cheezy Mac & Cheese\" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had \"Banana Pudding\" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.   Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!",

Not going to deny but I had high hopes and it was sort of a let down. We had the Pit Special 5 Meats 3 Sides. While the flavors are good it was barely lukewarm. And why would you chop up the brisket? More like scraps to me. All jokes aside.  The menu did indicate it is served chopped unless otherwise requested. Again, who notices that? Shouldn't it just be mentioned when you order upfront? I personally think they just want to get rid of their scraps as obviously captured in my photo.  The sides are pretty sorry. The waffle fries is nothing more than criss cross fries. Cheesy mac and cheese was not only cold but the worst I had. The yams is more of a dessert.  Tip: Ask for their special spicy sauce. It is so damn good! Skip the regular bbq sauce and vinegar out in the open.",

The ribs were SOOO good!!! my husband is pretty picky w/ his meats and he really liked them.. there was really good flavor, good smoke and definitely good chew!   the chicken was also pretty good too! brisket and pulled pork were just ok for me.   i loved the cornbread! it was super uber delicious!",

I've had this bookmarked for at least a couple months but being that is a couple of streets over from the strip I've procrastinated actually driving down here to eat! I left the fashion show mall this past week hungry and not wanting any nasty mall food lol. When I looked around the area for places to eat on yelp, this bookmark popped up! Headed on over in a hurry! When I pulled up I thought the outside was interesting with the picnic tables and yeah just the whole location is weird but needless to say who cares the food is good! The menu is posted on a HUGE window outside so that you are able to get your ordered figured out prior to going inside however in this 1000 degrees of heat I opted to read my menu INSIDE ha! The 3 meat trio priced at about $17.99 was fair and the only thing I didn't like was they could've gave me a little bit more of the mac n cheese for my side :-/ In addition to that order we also got the BBQ Nacho Fries with the brisket! Amazing! Wow all I have to say is if calories aren't a concern and you are in the area looking for great BBQ, LOOK NO FURTHER!",

I have to say really enjoy the meats I chose. They were really tender, flavorful and very meaty (just how I like it).   However,  I deducted 2 stars because the BBQ sauce was terrible and they had the nerve to charge for extra BBQ sauce. It tasted like tomato sauce with pepper (YUCK) and nothing BBQ about it. For me the sauce will make it or break it. I also was disappointed with the collard greens.   If you place a to go order, be sure to check it before you leave. My order was wrong when I first received it and wrong again after they tried to make it right.  Bring your favorite BBQ sauce it will go great with any of their meat.   In the future, I will get the meats there and make my own sides and use my own BBQ sauce at home.",

Lots if different BBQ options on the menu - I had the half chicken and green beans and it was really good. I saw some other patrons eating ribs that looked really good. This is not a restaurant but instead you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you at self seating picnic tables. The prices aren't super cheap so you are paying for quality. Overall, was enjoyable although not sure it's a must visit if you visit Vegas.",

I came in for dinner on a weeknight with my friend, since it was my first time I had no idea what to order and I failed to read the recommendations of others. I ended up ordering the beef hot link sandwich combo. It came with a drink and one side. When my order came out I looked at it and knew it was not going to be enough to fill me up. The price you pay for the amount of food you get was not justifiable to me. You get a small side that's as big as a KFC side and a plain hot link on bread. For my side I ordered the mac and cheese, it was okay, nothing spectacular, I've had better. The hot link was okay as well, it tasted like the ones you buy at the grocery store.   Service was fast and cashier was friendly. When we came in there wasn't a line so we were in and out pretty quick. I'll update my review once I'm able to try more items but I was really not that impressed with my first visit.",

The ribs were meaty and flavorful as well. For sides we had the yams, waffle fries, mac n cheese and baked beans which all were tasty. They have a pretty good variety of sauces.

Banana pudding and cobbler for dessert.",

    "text": "Rollin Smoke Barbeque was the first restaurant that I tried when I got to Vegas. I ordered the combo plate (ribs and brisket) with a side of coleslaw and mac n cheese.   The ribs were perfectly seasoned, and the meat just fell off the bones. It was barky, tasty, and smoky. I loved that the ribs were garnished with spring onions on top.   The brisket was just as amazing as the ribs. It was moist and had lots of flavor to it . Their seasoning had some secret spices in it, it was not your typical Texas seasoning. I liked the fact that they only put a tiny bit of sauce on their brisket. They didn't drown their meat with sauce. The meat was flavorful to a point that I decided to scratch the sauce off the meat. The brisket also had a great bark. You know what: it was barky, tasty and smoky.  Sadly, the sides were not on par with the meats. The coleslaw was bland, and the mac n cheese was too runny. It didn't taste fresh to me. I usually don't care about the sides as much as I care about the meat. I will be back next time that I am in Vegas.",

My sides were the dirty rice and the chipotle coleslaw. Let's get into the meat of it. The brisket was fantastic nice char not dry flavorful and delicious. The pulled pork is tender moist and succulent. The ribs were delicious flavorful and not even close to being dry. Lets get going to the sides.  the chipotle coleslaw was flavorful but not overly creamy. Just the way I like it! The dirty rice was fantastic combination of rice ground beef red onion and something else I couldn't tell what it was. I had all this for the paltry price of $24 it was a great deal for the amount of food that I got.  The Bad. It was a little bit of a drive from the strip, but that's not a problem because to find places like this you have to get away from the strip. Places like this that are affordable with great food are not always on the strip.  The Ugly. When I was done I wanted more and more and more. This could've gotten ugly.",

Admittedly there was trepidation at the idea of eating at some new location at of all places on...Highland Dr.    Located in an area known for plumbing supplies, auto repair, strip bars and this that or the other thing and BBQ!?  RSB was a totally unexpected \"Hump Day\" treat.  It was the rave upon our return to the office.   The outside upon initial glance may look greasy spoonish but this is by no means the case. The inside was comfortable with seats to spare.  It has a contemporary look inside but the smell and hospitality which leaves no doubt that this is serious BBQ.  That and the large smokers out in the parking lot.  I went with the \"Spudastic\" a baked potato filled with beef brisket and smothered with cheese and sour cream.  I combo'd the meal ordering as my side the jalapeno coleslaw and refreshing sweet tea.  It was pure joy to eat.  The ten of us dining while marveling the smoked pieces of brisket, pulled pork and sausage on a lone picnic  table outside in what is almost December...INCREDIBLE!   I will no longer tolerate the now benign flavor of that served up by the corporate so called BBQ joints. My taste buds are forever ruined.  SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!!",

    "text": "Here we go, brace yourselves. I'll be that guy. This is actually a friendlier version of my review for RSB; the original had cuss words and comparisons that probably would get me in trouble that's the version you needed to brace yourselves for.  When it comes to BBQ, American BBQ, I've gone to St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City, Texas, the Carolinas, various states in the East, South, Mid-West, and West, pre-Yelp and current Yelp days, and have experienced both good and bad BBQ. You can say I've had more than my share of BBQ and can tell a good BBQ from just a decent BBQ place but no way am I an expert. I've hated BBQ spots locals loved. So IMHO and friendlier version RSB is just decent, OK is being nice. I've been here a few times and well I am NOT a fan. Each time I've been disappointed with one thing or another. Yes I've gone back but that's just cause everyone's been raving about RSB and I wanted to give them another shot and then another.  One of my first visits was with a group of 5-6 from work. I don't remember what everyone exactly ordered but remembered me having the chopped pork sandwich and another having the chopped chicken sandwich which neither I can find on the menu, must have been a special. Anyways from both of the sandwiches we created a community pile of what's this!? tiny pieces of chicken bones. There were a lot of chopped up chicken spine and rib bones all mixed in our meats. Even if I was mistakenly served chicken with my pork, bones, really RSB. I had more typed out but I leave it as that. The only good thing about it was I had a free dessert with Yelp check-in. STRIKE ONE.  After writing off RSB for a couple months the group made it back out. This time ribs and Outlaw burgers were ordered. They certainly took their time bringing the ribs out.  Ribs were ordered first and was last to be served. What exactly were they doing!? Warming it up or cooking them as it was ordered. I actually asked for and ate my dessert first cause I was hungry. The ribs that came out was beyond disappointing tough, rubbery, had little taste, and sucked. I've had way better.  I noticed my ribs were different from the others. Oh there's a \"rib plate\" and a \"rib platter special\". STRIKE TWO.  After working up an appetite playing basketball all morning I came here looking to finally clear things up and getting the rib platter special. It was a lot of ribs but it lost all its luster. The beef rib wasn't as tender as I was hoping but tender to some liking. The rest were decent nothing exciting just a lot of meat covered in sauce. I smelt all the smoke inside and outside of the RSB but I got only a hint of smoke taste. STRIKE THREE. Throat slash.   The best BBQ in Vegas!? I don't know about that. Maybe, than again Vegas aren't known for BBQ and the ones I've enjoyed no longer are open so maybe I don't know anything about BBQ plus I sometimes enjoy buffet BBQ ribs. You want more info there's AYCE BBQ for $24.99. It's located off a few side streets near the Strip. They have a small parking lot which is shared with the other businesses. They're from Arkansas. They're friendly but I wouldn't call the service great. There's large tables, small tables, and booths. Lines for ordering can form out the door. Just go if you like go.",

We weren't super hungry so we decided to just order the \"pit special\" which came with the 5 meats and 3 sides.  Since it was our first time here, I wasn't sure which sides to decide on so I did what any newbie would do, ask the cashier for her suggestions.  To my surprise, Jessica's rude reply in a rude tone was \"everything is popular, just pick something!\"  I was kind of taken aback, even if I was trying to be understanding that it is dinner time & there were five other people behind me.  The food was a 3.5, maybe 4-star, but I am deducting the 1-star for Jessica's rudeness.  Out of the five meats, I liked the pork ribs and pulled pork the most.  The hot links were pretty good as well.  Although, the chopped up beef briskets were dry & flavorless, but the BBQ sauce definitely helped.  The chicken was ok.  The three sides we chose included dried up mac 'n cheese which was very plain & dry.  The infamous corn nuggets were pretty interesting, but not as delicious as they looked in the photos.  They ran out so we had to wait about 10 minutes after our food arrived for the corn nuggets.  However, the baked beans were the saving grace of those three choices...I pretty much ate the whole thing to myself.",

Brisket was nice and smoked with a delightful pepper crust. Hot link was average. Macaroni was below average w little flavor to speak of. Beans also lacked a depth of flavor as well. House and the hottest sauces were both below average.   Wishing we had tried a different BBQ spot this trip:/",

Definitely value for money because they were quite meaty ribs. My only issue was the beef one was extremely fatty. Don't get me wrong, I love the fat on ribs but this was just way too much for my liking. Also, I have an Aussie palette so we like everything well seasoned so that's probably why the flavour just didn't do it for me, the smokiness however was spot on though.",

As an update to my prior review from June of 2013...this place is decent but it seems their success is getting the best of them now and things just aren't what they used to be. It's not only me who is noticing this...I rarely, if ever, see anyone check-in here anymore whereas 2 years ago it was occurring nearly every day.  Service; not as good as it used to be, plain and simple.  Prices; seems like a 30% increase across the board.  Quality; meh, this is now on par with Lucille's if you ask me.  The last few times I've been there or had delivery the food was not fresh and seemed to be of lower quality.  Some items were cold, others old left overs and rubbery.  Don't believe the hype...anymore.",

I thought the pulled pork would have the BBQ already one it and the brisket when it says chopped I figured like chopped into slices not demolish. Maybe I got the last of it idk? However when I think of brisket I think slices not a pile of shredded beef.   I may try this place again however going to try to find another joint first.",

Everywhere we go, when we get back home and I'm all excited because I've had a good meal, but she just sits back and say, \"It was ok.\"  No seriously, everything was awesome. We got a lot of food, not JUST because we were starving, but because we wanted a large variety of food so that we could give them a fair chance to impress us. Well, job done! I have to say, we were impressed!  With the help of the perky and oh so passionate cashier, we ordered the Pit Special 5 Meat 3 Sides for 27.99. It came with Brisket, Pulled Pork, 1/4 Chicken, 2 Spare Ribs and Hot Links for the meats and we got Mac & Cheese, Yams and Kick'n BBQ Beans for the sides. We also ordered a Peach Cobbler on the side.  We enjoyed The whole meal and we ate every bit of it. The best part to me was the Hot Links and maybe the Mac & Cheese, if you force me to pick. To be honest, when we go back, the only change that we would make is, instead of the Peach Cobbler, we would order Mama's Banana Pudding.  I do want to mention that the Peach Cobbler was really oily. It was probably because of the cream that was on top, but either way, we've both had better. I wouldn't order it again.  All in all, the customer service was great and the food was more than just good, it was great lol! We added this place to our Favorites list.",

The Mac and cheese was probably the best I've ever had - very cheesy and creamy with big noodles. It's even topped with shredded cheese! The cornbread was sweet and cakelike.

All in all great tasting but two tiny sandwiches and some pudding aren't worth $40 or even $25. They need some consistency or they're going to start losing customers.",

I also got the Banana pudding - great!      The second time I got the salad with chicken and a half chicken.  The salad was VERY good and the half chicken was left half eaten because the salad was so filling.  But I still had room for another banana pudding.",

Pulling into the location, it looked a bit shady.  I hesitated.  Then I noticed there was a good sized line inside.  Maybe this is a local favorite after all then, right?  The staff was super friendly.  The food was meh.  I've from Tennessee and I grew up having great BBQ so this didn't quite meet my expectations, especially after reading all the rave reviews online.  I would probably not venture this way again, but I also wouldn't complain if I got dragged along with someone else.  Maybe I have a different standard, but I though it was just okay.",

This place is a short Uber away, has great (read: normal) prices, and really tasty food. If you're a sweet tea lover like me, look no further!   They're an Arkansas-loving joint, so that's exciting is you have ties to that southern state. The food was all good, fresh, and flavorful. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich meal with corn nuggets (new to me) and tea. I think it was $14...maybe? In Vegas I feel like that's a steal! Plus, service was pretty quick and the staff members were all friendly and sweet.  The rest of my group had ribs, all the sauces, waffle fries, mac and cheese, the sampler platter, and corn bread. YUM!   Be advised that it's not a huge place, so if you do have more than 4 people maybe consider going at an off-peak time or prepare to sit at a picnic table out front.",

This hole in the wall place is a must visit!  That is until we came here to Rollin Smoke. We ordered two different platters to try as much of the menu as we could. They have the absolute BEST pork ribs I have ever had in my life. St. Louis and baby back and spare ribs, they were all delicious!! So tender and fall of the bone and meaty with the perfect smokiness to it. We also got half a rack of beef ribs and they were definitely meaty and smoky and delicious but we love the ones from Phil's more. The one thing I didn't enjoy as much was the brisket as it was all chopped up like it was for babies. The pulled pork was good too and it came with a couple of soft warm dinner rolls that I used to make pulled pork mini sliders with. They have so many options for sauces and I had to try them all. In the end I couldn't pick a favorite because they were all so good.   The Mac and cheese was so good and the waffle fries were super yummy. My favorite had to be the friend corn fritters (don't think that's what they're called but you'll see it). Fried balls of cream corn inside what it tasted like to be cornbread batter. This was my dream come True. Can't believe this was my first time here even though I have visited Vegas countless times.   This is definitely a bucket list must try thing to do in Vegas!!",

Shredded bbq pork is delicious even when you dip it any choice of bbq sauces.   I would highly recommend it if you're in town & craving some BBQ.",

What called my name was the $35 AYCE deal, quite literally a bargain for any big eater and lover of barbecue. I can't recall ever seeing All-you-can-eat at a dedicated BBQ restaurant that wasn't just some dinky buffet. AYCE gets you access to everything on the menu, from mains to desserts, and it's well-worth the money. My favorite main dish here would have to be the giant baked potato, a beast of a spud topped with meat, sour cream and cheese sauce. It cured my carb deficiency in a right hurry! Most importantly to me, the people who run this establishment are incredibly polite, friendly, and welcoming. It's a great mix of values that describe the best of places I've eaten in Vegas, Victorville and beyond. If you love burgers or BBQ, you need to eat here.",

Something like 6 different sauces.  Every one of them tasted great.  The hot one was really good too but a little bit hot for me.  The rest made it to my food.   Along with all of the soda flavors, they have a few different choices of cool-aid.  Such an awesome idea.  I went for the unsweet iced tea.  Their cups are practically souvenir cups and are going in our China cabinet :)  The service is very very friendly.   It doesn't take much to be nice so why can't this be the norm for all restaurants!?  Atmosphere inside:  A+  got to sit at the picnic tables.  Just goes with BBQ. Atmosphere outside:  was great weather so sitting on the picnic tables out front is perfect. Neighborhood: ehh, it's off the strip Vegas. Taste: A+++ Quantity:  actually pretty good portions. Employees:  A+++  not over the top but genuinely friendly.   Cost:  BBQ ain't cheap but I didn't feel like it was over priced, especially in a tourist area.  Went for lunch and tried to talk my family into going back for dinner or brunch tomorrow but they vetoed me.",

I have had both the sliced and chopped brisket and prefer the chopped as it is more moist and juicy...you will defiantly walk away with the meat sweats!  If you are a local from Las Vegas you can save 10% off the bill by letting them know at the register.  If you are in Vegas do not pass up this place if you like bbq!",

    "text": "I'm primarily interested in ribs when I visit a BBQ spot and usually do not visit a place if I don't see smoke and can't smell BBQ from about a block away.  There is a big pit on the side of the building but I got close to it and it wasn't hot, not even warm so it was obvious that it had not been used that day.  I have also noticed that \"BBQ\" places that serve things like nachos, seafood and meatloaf usually have bad BBQ.  I saw excellent reviews here so I decided to give this place a shot.  I ordered the two meat duo with spare ribs and links.  Took forever, about 25 minutes, they should be able to get food out faster, especially if the food is not cooked to order.  The ribs were OK, very little flavor, rather bland, the links tasted like spicy hot dogs.  I also don't understand the green onions.  I've never, ever seen that on BBQ but as I looked around they were on everything.  I'm still on my quest to find decent BBQ west of Texas, doesn't look like it's gonna happen.  I've had BBQ at a gas station in Texas that is better than anything I've found in Cali or Nevada.",

Until that time, I try to keep my visits here to a couple a month.  Given how good the food is, that has proven difficult.  Two weeks ago, I took some co-workers here and one of them ordered the fried shrimp.  I know!  Stupid, right?  WRONG!  Because she eats like a bird, she gave each of us a piece and dang!  That was some amazing fried shrimp.  The batter has a lot of spices and is similar to the cornmeal batter used for catfish.  So good.  The regulars in our group agreed that the fried shrimp is our next order.    Lately, I've noticed that business is really picking up.  Glad to see it, but I considered keeping my mouth shut about this place from now on.  My duties as a Yelper won out in the end.  I go to lunch pretty early, so my current mission is to make it here when the greens are ready (these take a hot minute to cook right), because there's really not much I love more than good greens.  If my meaningful physical relationship with another human being does not work out, I may marry The Pulled Piggy with a side of kickin beans.",

There are also plenty of places to sit, including tables outside.  But, since I came during the Las Vegas summer, there was no way I was sitting outside.  I was having trouble deciding between the Outlaw Burger and the 2 meat duo with pork and brisket.  The guy that was helping me suggested the meatloaf, which is made up of both brisket and pork and smoked.  It comes with potatoes on the bottom and BBQ sauce and fried onions on the top with pickle slices and a roll on the side.  I added fried okra, because if a place has fried okra I have to try it.  I was glad I took this guy's suggestion.  The slab is ENORMOUS, it easily fed me for dinner as well, and I'm a big eater.  The smoke in the meatloaf was incredible, very impressive.  I could have used more fried onions, but what dish couldn't?  I'll order more next time I eat here.  When you had a bite with the sauce and the onions, it was the perfect blend of crunch, meat and a bit of spice.  The okra was very good, but not the best I've had.  Service was fantastic, it took a bit to get my food, but they are super popular and making your food when you order.  So, it's worth waiting a few minutes.  Highly recommended, and the leftovers did great that evening with a second heating...",

David even came over to check on us at the end of our meal which was greatly appreciated and added to the comfy, homey vibe of the restaurant.

Ordered totally off special menu:  Smoked meatball sub with side ( went with mac n cheese) and drink ( $9)  Slider trio with side( picked cole slaw) - meats were pulled pork, sausage and chicken ($11 ?? )   Rib combo - beef, st louis and baby included ( $16)  we've yet to try the ribs since the other food filled us up !  The meatball sammie was actually 3 sliders - each had cheese and a decent sized, dense meatball drowning in a very spicy sauce - loved it !   The trio sliders - also spiked with the spicy bbq sauce - loved the pulled pork and the sausage - would've preferred brisket for the 3rd slider ( probably could've had if i asked ) - large pile of meat on each slider;  smoky goodness - all good !  As usual, the sides complimented the meat perfectly.  I've kicked my rating up a star since they've maintained the quantity/quality of the meat AND the service was excellent.  Oh yes, I'll be back !!  pics included",

Food is delivered to the table by calling out your name to determine where you were seated. The tables that were mentioned in another review have been replaced with ones that have clean stainless steel tops.  The following items were all excellent with the right amount of smoke. Pulled Pork, juicy with just the right amount of sauce. Sliced Brisket was fork tender.  Ribs perfect fall of the bone. Several delicious sides. Jalapeno cole slaw, pinto beans. Sorry no room for dessert. Maybe next time  These folks are doing some fine BBQ. They could be serious contenders at Memphis in May if they choose to compete.  Keep on Smokin!!",

From the main meats down to the sides.  I mean, I wish I could in some sense describe my experience here so that it even comes close to the actual event....   I ordered a rib basket, and for $14.99 I got a beef rib, pork ribs, and a half rack baby back rib.  Now that may not sound like much, but the ribs are HUGE.  The beef rib was the largest I've ever seen.  The meat was tender, juicy, and just shaved off the bone with my plastic fork.  The pork ribs were good, more dense as it should be but still juicy, flavorful meat.  And I can tell you I've never had a baby back rib that even came close to this baby back rib.    Onto the sides.  I've never had a jalapeno slaw that came close to this one, a fantastic blend of spice and sweet, not soppy wet and not dry either.  Mash potatoes with melted cheddar and chives!  Holy crap.  The potato salad was fantastic.  Now I have one rule about BBQ is that I ALWAYS have room for the banana pudding.  I'm sorry to say I broke my rule, so I am not going to be able to inform on the banana pudding.  On my next trip to Vegas, you better believe this will be on my list to return to.  Maybe twice :)  And this says something, because the BBQ place is not a walk from the strip, it's a definite taxi ride, but if you are a fan of the show, Counts Kustoms is a little less than a mile walking distance from this place, up the same road so you may kill two birds with one stone.",

Being someone who barbecues and smokes a great deal, I was a bit skeptical since other \"bbq\" joints we've tried just never measured up. I am happy to say this one did. We both had a three meat combo, with both of us having the pulled pork and brisket. My wife went with the spare ribs and I had the hot link for our third meat. We both found the brisket to be moist and tender with a great flavor and just the right amount of smoke. The pulled pork was moist and tender as well, though it could have used a bit more smoke and maybe some bite to it, more of a personal preference though. Fpr the sides my wife had the waffle fries which were good, but it's hard to screw up fires. I went with the bacon potato salad which was excellent, I also got an order of the corn nuggets which were nothing short of Oh my God good. Though it is a bit of a drive from where we live, we will be back.  To Dusty and the rest of the folks at Rollin Smoke, thanks for giving Vegas good bbq.",

They did, and the website said $24.95 per person. We walked in, and there was a piece of paper over the price on the menu board that said $34.95. I told the girl that was ringing us up that her website said $24.95, and I didn't think it was right to do the bait and switch, we had driven two cars 20 miles to get there. She said \"you could access the website?\"! I pulled it up on my phone and showed her. She went to talk to someone in the back, then returned and said, sorry, that's the price. I said, \"so you're not going to honor your advertised price?\". She said, \"do you want to talk to somebody else?\". I said only if it might make a difference. She went and got the owner. He told me \"sorry, I had to raise the price or I'd be out of business, that's been our price for three months\". I of course said, \"you've had three months to update your website and you're not willing to honor your advertised price?\". He said sorry. I really wanted to eat there, it smelled great. I can not however patronize a place that will not honor their advertised price, especially if it's been wrong for three months on their website. I can't imagine how that can't be intentional. I will not ever walk back into that place.",

If you are a beef rib fan as I am you will simply not find a better smoked beef rib as good as this except maybe in Texas. Baby backs were top notch. Spares were also excellent but I like mine a bit more fall of the bone then these. Did not try pulled pork but will next time. Not fancy and no booze but who cares? Area is industrial but safe.

    "text": "Finally got a chance to give this place a try. I got to say I was pretty disappointed. Maybe it was high expectations due to the many 4-5 star reviews, maybe I just don't know good barbeque when I eat it. By no means am i a BBQ connoisseur but here's my take on this place. I can only comment on the brisket and the sides I ordered. I got a to go order of 1lb. of brisket, a side of loaded mash, yams, & mac n' cheese. When I opened up the container with the brisket I was really irritated because it was chopped. Maybe that's my fault because I assumed it would be sliced. I know some places ask if you want it sliced or chopped like Dickey's but the cashier never asked so I guess I assumed. Ok fine it's chopped no crying over that. However it wasn't really even chopped it was really in small, tiny pieces, like the kind of little pieces that are left from sliced meat. I feel like it was all the scraps leftover from slicing. All of the pieces were dark, like the outer crust of the meat. I couldn't find any pieces in there that were grayish like it is in the center. This probably explains why it was overly salty since it was all the outer pieces. Thank goodness there was a slice of bread underneath because it would have been really hard to eat alone. I didn't even want to put any sauce on it since it was too salty. Oh and I got a little small container of sauce for 1lb of brisket but I guess in my situation it didn't matter. It just wasn't enjoyable at all. As far as the sides go, they were ok. Nothing spectacular. Yams were good, mac n cheese decent, loaded mash was similar to Dickey's mash which is decent. Maybe I need to try their brisket sliced, maybe I need to try something else on their menu. I don't know. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon which is too bad because I really wanted to love this place.",

While trying to decide what to order a young very pleasant waitress/server offered a suggestion....can't remember the dish...but it had 3 diff kind of ribs, she said it would be enough for both myself and husband to share - I would strongly disagree the portions aren't that generous. An older man took our order...unfriendly, he'd be better staying in the back. The meal came with one drink...he slipped another $2 pop on the bill - the order came with a bun....in fact that is a slice of stale bread which the remainder of the meal is stacked upon...interesting! We also ordered a side of onion rings. Food arrived, minus onion rings - they would follow per server. The waffle fries were stone cold....I went to the front - grumpy guy wasn't there so I mentioned it to a server...she could've cared less, I offered her one to touch, it hadn't felt heat for some time, she declined, she said she'd get us fresh ones.....10 mins later, ribs gone - fries arrive - 3 mins later the worst onion rings arrived. I will say the ribs were good, but the kitchen obviously is disorganized and they need new frontline people. I will not follow the recommendations of any tv show again....McD's would have been a better choice for overall satisfaction.",

    "text": "An awesome experience if your looking for great BBQ! It's more cafeteria style in that you order, then sit down and then the food is brought to you. I ordered the brisket sandwich. The brisket is very soft- almost as soft as the bread itself. The sandwich consisted of the brisket, BBQ sauce, and some chopped green onion. I appreciate the simplicity, but everything was the same texture and it could have used a crunch. I liked it though, and I would order it again. My boyfriend got the rib sampler which consisted of spare ribs, baby backs, and one beef rib. Baby back are excellent, spare ribs are everything you would expect, beef rib is very good as well but he doesn't normally like beef ribs. The sauce itself is good and I liked that they only gave one option, because that's the only one you need. We also had the sides Mac n cheese and jalapeno coleslaw. In my opinion, these two sides can be skipped. Mac n cheese tasted a little too artificially cheesy, and the coleslaw had an overwhelming jalapeno flavor. Cornbread was everything you want, sweet, soft, warm, delicious. What really made my experience though, was the amazing staff! They are so helpful and so nice throughout the entire experience. Go here. You'll love it.",

    "text": "This is a new out of the way bbq restaurant that recently opened on Highland Dr.  I know that Highland is an industrial and seedy area west of the strip, but these guys are turning out some good bbq and making the most of what they have.  I recently tried the Biggin sandwich (brisket, pulled pork and sausage) and it was very tasty.  The sandwich was loaded with meat, literally falling off the bun, all of the meats were tender and had a good smoke flavor.  Along with my sandwich was a side of bacon potatoe salad, which was good.  The potatoe salad had good flavor and bacon in just about every bite.  Total for my sandwich, salad and drink ran me $11, which I think is a good value for quality food. This is a spicier bbq than most people are used to, but it works.  It reminds me more of a kicked up Kansas City style bbq.  I stuck with the original sauce, which was plenty hot and did not try the spicy or the extra spicy.  All in all this place is making some pretty good bbq, which is much needed in Las Vegas.  The biggest draw back is that they are located on Highland next to Diamond Cabaret and they are only open until 6pm.  I would like to see this place do well, hence my review, but their limited hours and location create much doubt. Good Luck!",

I'm glad I took a chance since it was off strip as it paid off. The vibe was very chill and the staff was great. The food was amazing. There were lots of choices. I decided to do the 3 meat combo platter with the chopped brisket, ribs and hot links sausage with the side of Mac and cheese. There were different sauces to choose from as well. I mostly left the meats alone as it didn't need any sauces but it def added some extra flavor to the brisket. Mac and cheese had great flavor as well. Overall great place off the strip although it wasn't too far off. Definitely recommended if you're around the area.",

If you have ever been to Texas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, or even Kansas City you have an idea about what I'm talking about because you can smell all of these places food as soon as you pull your car up.   First of all, I should have known better when I walked into the restaurant and didn't smell the smoke or the BBQ.  The food taste like they either boiled it first and then cooked it in an oven or kitchen grill top.   Secondly, you are given small portions for big time prices. Far to expensive for a mediocre food.  Now if you are from Las Vegas then I can understand why you would like them because you don't know any better.  Nevada Chicken is much more better and at an affordable price but they were closed for the 4 of July.",

Pouring ANY bbq sauce is sacrilege and should be punishable by law. Baby backs: most xlnt, the flavor is right on, zero room for improvement. Pulled pork: very good, great flavour. not the best I ever had but very good never the less Links: very good. Chicken: good flavour, mine was a bit on the dry side. Bbq sauces: all exceed all expectations, these folks know exactly what they are doing. Potato salad: very very good, xlnt flavor and consistency. Baked beans: good, abit too sweet for my taste, Coleslaw: just ok, didn't care much for it,I like mine crisp.

    "text": "Pretty good BBQ spot! I haven't tried many here in Vegas, so I can't definitively say that they are the best, but I enjoyed my meal.  First, don't come expecting anything fancy or close to it. While not a hole in the wall, it's pretty basic, picnic benches, wait in line to order your food (luckily, when we arrived, there was no wait, but there was a long one about midway through the meal), and a server will bring your food to you. You get your own drink (fountain drinks), plastic ware and plates. It's very close quarters, so people will be all around you while you eat.   The cashier was very sweet and a real jokester! She told us that they were out of everything but hot links and got a good laugh out of seeing my face drop! She reassured me that she was just kidding and we proceeded from there.   My friend and I decided to split the 5 meat, 3 sides platter ($27) and get an order of cornbread on the side. The platter comes with: chopped brisket, pulled pork, hot links, 1/4 chicken, and 2 ribs. Of everything, I liked the ribs best- they were tender and seasoned well. The hot links were spicy but good. The chicken was fine, but nothing to write home about. I was slightly disappointed in the brisket- it was SUPER fatty. Like almost all fat. It tasted great, but greasy and just not enough meat. The pork was pretty dry, sadly.  The sides, however, were all awesome. I could have eaten a tub of corn nuggets, they were that good! The Mac and cheese was delicious, and I really enjoyed the baked beans as well. The cornbread was yummy- sweet, dense, moist.  We had enough food to take some home, so that's always a plus. Someone did check on us during our meal, which also was appreciated.  Next time I crave some bbq, and I'm in the area, I may stop by!",

    "text": "Four of us stopped here for lunch after hiking yesterday.  This has been bookmarked for a long time so I was glad we were going here.  We ordered on the right side where you enter and then waited at a table on the more dining room side.  I ordered the meat trio with pork, ribs, and hot link.  I also showed them my Yelp check in offer for a free pudding with a sandwich which they honored even though I didn't order a sandwich.  Since the trio is more expensive, I guess it doesn't matter.  I could tell from the time we walked in that they did their own smoking.  The place is heavy with the smell of smoke.  In fact, the first thing I did when I got home was to change my shirt.  The trio of meats was OK.  The pork was lukewarm at best and was dry.  It needed their BBQ sauce.   Two of us had gotten that and both were the same so there was something not right with the heating in the kitchen.  The meat fell off the ribs and was very good.  I'm surprised I liked them as much as I did.  The hot link was also good.  As a side I got the kicken beans but there was nothing these beans were going to kick.  They were just normal baked beans with some spice.  The banana pudding was OK.  It was nothing special and I'm sure it comes from some kind of bulk make your own package.  The serve yourself soda was great.  I was really thirsty after the hike and I went back and refilled several times.  I guess I sealed the deal yesterday and realized I'm really not a BBQ person.  Lunch was OK but it's nothing that I would crave nor go out of my way to get again.",

    "text": "Oh man, where do i start...  Now that I have recovered from the behemoth meal that was Rollin Smoke Barbeque, I can now gather myself to write this review.  First of all, if you come here expect to wait in a line. Don't worry though, the line moves fairly quickly.  Here's what we ordered:  1/2 slab baby back rib plate (4/5) - Very meaty ribs, not fall off the bone but still juicy. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because they didn't remove the casing from the outside of the rib and it made it a little hard to eat. Overall, I liked it and would order again.  Outlaw burger (5/5) - My boyfriend who is a total burger aficionado tells me that this is the best burger he's ever had! Keep in mind that he loves bbq and bbq sauce so this burger did not cramp his style. There are tender pieces of brisket paired with ground beef, fried onion strings, barbeque sauce. Don't be shy because this WILL get messy!  Service is good here and people are really friendly. Unlike other casual dining places, the staff actually comes to check up on you after they've delivered your food.   Oh yeah and we checked in on yelp and they gave us a free ice cream sundae due to our burger order. Can't beat that!",

    "text": "I don't know why it took me over a year to come back. Rollin Smoke deserves more of my visits.  I brought a friend in today for dinner. It was her first time, so she spent a few minutes to look at the wall-sized menu. I also found myself staring and trying to decide what to get. I wasn't feeling up to tackling a big portion today, so I didn't get the outstanding Outlaw Burger again. Instead, I went with the Catfish Po Boy ($8.99) and a dessert of Country Berry Cobbler (free with purchase of sandwich and Yelp check-in).  I spent some time nibbling on my friend's Dad's Favorite, which is actually a sandwich (and thus qualifies for the dessert, although we didn't know it at the time). The brisket, pork, and hot links were all pretty tasty, although my friend could have done without the hot links because she is even more heat-averse than I am. She definitely went for a soda refill at least once.  My po boy took upwards of 10 minutes longer to come out, which I felt was a good sign. It was worth it for that catfish. It was quite moist and flaky, properly seasoned, and lightly crunchy on the outside. The catfish was definitely the star. No complaints about the spicy and tartar sauces, which I ended up spreading all over the sandwich. Lettuce was fine, lemon was helpful, and tomato brought a nice lightness. Only thing I would have liked is if the bread was buttered or something. The bread was merely toasted, and it actually looked a bit burnt, but thankfully had none of that off-putting flavor.  The country berry cobbler actually came out at the same time as the po boy. Unfortunately, by the time I was ready for dessert, the whipped cream had died. I actually had the peach cobbler last time, and while I would probably take the peach if forced to choose one, the berry cobbler is also very good and has enough of a tartness to offset the sweetness. It was also still warm, since it was served in a foam bowl, but I'm thinking that it contributed to the downfall of the whipped cream. I'll have to remember to try to ask for a delayed dessert presentation if I do this again.  I noticed that at least 3 tables had people doing the AYCE, and that made me wish that I hadn't had lunch today. I definitely want to try the all you can eat option some time. I enjoy that sort of thing, and I would finally be able to get my hands on all of their meats at once. Maybe I'll be ready to bump it up to 5 stars on that day, but until then, I still highly recommend Rollin Smoke Barbeque to all lovers of meat - and catfish.",

    "text": "As with anyone who has been to Vegas a few times, you grow sick of the options on the strip, so one of my goals was to find a few places off the beaten path for us to try this next time around.   BBQ is really the reason I started yelping and everywhere I go, I usually seek out a BBQ place to try, so when I saw all the positive reviews of Rollin' Smoke, naturally I was a bit excited.   After our first long night in Vegas, we decided to skip breakfast and hit up Rollin' Smoke for an early lunch. Our cabby didn't know where it was, but it was a fairly quick ride from the strip.  Walking in, you are greeted with a glorious, thick, smoky smell that always accompanies good BBQ. As with all my BBQ reviews, I usually seek out a way to try out most of the meats, so we ordered the three Pit Specials (3 meats, 2 sides) and one order of the Beef Ribs. We quickly realized we ordered too much food for the four of us, but it was no matter, it was all delicious. The meats:  The Pulled Pork - The pulled pork was flavorful and moist, with a moderate smoky flavor. If you like pulled pork, you won't be disappointed by this.   The Hot Link Sausage - Despite how good the other meats were, the Hot Link made a good run to be one of my favorites. This isn't like most hot links you see which are red in color, both on the sausage meat and on the casing, with that annoying spicy flavor that seems to linger forever. These had a reddish-brown casing and a very delicious and unique flavor too them, with a nice spiciness as well. Definitely recommend.   The Ribs - The baby backs were delicious. Moist, tender, fall off-the-bone good. They seasoning added some nice flavor as did the moderate-to-strong smokiness. Another awesome dish.  The Brisket - The brisket we were served was from the lean side and had a nice smoke ring to it and despite being from the lean side, was not dry at all. Very solid brisket and only due to the greatness of the other dishes was this our least favorite.   The Beef Rib - Holy crap, the other reviewers were not wrong. This thing is amazing. It should be called The Flinstone or Brontosaurus Rib. It is massive. It has an amazing bark, strong smokiness, and tons of meat. It wasn't too gristly either, like many beef ribs tend to be. You get two ribs for 15 bucks and you think that is steep until you receive them. That will be more than enough to fill you up. A must order here.   The Sauce - I think good BBQ can be graded as to whether it needs sauce, and the BBQ here stands on its own. However, the sauce was pretty good if you like sauce. The rust-colored sauce starts out sweet and ends tangy and is fairly runny too. It is great for dipping and doesn't overpower the  meat.   So the 4.5 star rating for Rollin' Smoke is spot on and consider this to be a 4.5 star review to match as well. This Arkansas-style BBQ just made it on my mandatory to-do list in Vegas for each trip. If you like BBQ, don't pass this place up.",

The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars because the set up is a bit confusing. 2 entrance doors one to the dinning area and the other to the main entrance with a few tables, does not have any signage IE seat your self, order here...  So at first we sat down and waited 10 minutes and we realized that we had to order up front.  The menu is massive with all these delectable choices and sides and the smell inside makes you even hungrier.  The writing on the board on the wall is a bit small and intimidating since there are so many things to choose from.  When you get to the counter they only have one menu for you to look at so it holds up the line when you are trying to order.  I chose the mixed platter and the girl at the counter choose my meats and I had potato salad and mac n cheese as my sides, friend ordered all you can eat.  Food took a little bit longer than I would have wanted to but it was 4th of July weekend so it is totally understandable.  When our food arrived it was hot, and it looked amazing.  The food tasted even better than it looked if that is even possible.  I had baby, short and beef ribs and my friend had one of everything on the all you can eAt.  The ribs were perfectly cooked nice bite to it but still fell off the bone.  The bbq sauce on the table was refilled while we were still eating and it was warm and complimented the ribs perfectly.  These guys definitely know what they are doing and they have the recipe for success.    Just a suggestion for first timers (I will be coming back and I will have your system down)  Place a hostess podium with menus, make signage saying pick up menu, wait in line, place order and find a seat.  By having menus available people will stand in line less time and it will be easier for the order takers to expedite service.  Other than that I have absolutely nothing negative to say.  Thank you for all the delicious food you are serving us.",

The doorman suggested we take a cab because the restaurant is in a bit sketchy location next to a strip club. As usual, we found this place on Yelp and decided we must visit this place. The place is a bit on the small side and the tables and chairs are a bit stained like the other reviewers mentioned. My wife and I ordered the special for 2 persons and it came out to $20 with a fountain drink. It also came with 2 sides, we ordered the home fries and the mac & cheese. Home fries was tasty but on bit on the greasy side and the mac& cheese seemed a bit tasteless and stale. We ordered brisket pulled pork, and short rib. The short rib was the best of the three. The brisket is a bit on the dry side. My suggestion is double up on the short rib when you order and get the pulled pork or the chicken for $20. 3 choice of meat for $20 enough to feed 2 hungry people from NYC. Not a bad deal at all. All you need is new chairs.",

Everything we had was great - even the seafood platter I had, which had a nice gritty corn-meal coating, and was not greasy at all. The corn bread, hush puppies, and fried okra were all as good as I've had, and I'd definitely recommend them. Especially the okra, as many places ruin this dish.   Very friendly owner from Arkansas made us feel welcome. The free refills on the drinks were welcome, as some of the sauces were pretty spicy. The only bad part was that the neighborhood was pretty unseemly, even for Vegas. We ate out at the picnic bench, and let's just say the sights were pretty interesting. But a very authentic restaurant with excellent, inexpensive food.",

Dusty and John built that place from the ground up and if you treat um well, they'll return the favor. I'll definitely be stopping in again!!! No complaints here. 5/5",

Everything was delicious!!!!  Their sauce has a little kick to it which is just enough.  This is now a definite stop every time we come to Vegas!",

And last but not least, we experienced some of the best customer service I've every encountered in Vegas. Rusty, the Pit Master, and the rest of the good folks here were super hospitable.

This burger has lettuce, tomato, cheese,onion straws, a burger patty and brisket.  To take a bite I had to open my jaw as wide as possible and smash the burger down in the process!  There is no doubt I can say this is the best BBQ burger I've had in my life and for $8 it left me very full (that and the free dessert I received for checking in on Yelp!).  I'm really looking forward to trying other BBQ items on the menu, there was so many good looking things to choose from that it was overwhelming.  6/10/13  Just had the brisket sandwich over the weekend and it was awesome!  Very tender, melt in your mouth good.  I brought a group of friends and everyone thought it was amazing.  I'm so glad they have a large menu because I will want to come back here and try everything!",

First of all, this is a True hole in the wall place...I would have never tried it if it wasn't for Yelp, and I would have barely found it if they didn't have the BBQ grilles parked out front!  Start off with the food....the Pulled Pork sandwich is truly amazing  :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#3VPTArn4TCy4jDYzeSJbyw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  Beautiful char carmelization on the outside...tender juicy goodness on the insides....and the tangy BBQ sauce sets it off!  Not spicy, but it has that flavor depth that is needed for an interesting (but not overpowering) BBQ sauce.  It is easily the best pulled pork sandwich I have had, but it is actually one of my most favorite ways I have consumed the pork beast himself.  For the side, I asked what was most recommended.  I was told to try the mac and cheese :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#uGQtCaucN0VVUbvSjXBlkQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  It was good!  Lots of spices in here...not spicy, but with more depth and distinguishing tastes put into the food here than a normal mac and cheese at most other places.  I can feel the love :P  Yelp check-in merited a free dessert...I was recommended the Peach Cobbler (pictured with the sandwich).  It came out piping hot, gooey and tasty....just wish I had some crust in there like the one I love so much at Wing King.  But besides being crustless, this was an excellent rendition.  I will say that there was a miscommunication at order though, and my side also never came out with my food until I reminded them it was missing.  I was strongly considering dropping my 5 to a 4 star, but the food and prices are so good, that I feel guilty holding it against them.  If the order was taken correctly the first time, I doubt I would have had anything to complain about...again, just a miscommunication.  I'll be back!",

We went a little before closing on the Saturday before memorial day and unfortunately they had run out of all meats except the pork ribs and pulled pork. The person who took our order was very kind and cheerful. Unfortunately the ribs were a little chewy, not fall of the bone tender, but the aside from that was tasty and had a nice little bit of spice to it. I got the combo with the loaded mashed potatoes and they were okay; potato with green onions and shredded cheese on top.  I would definitely like to try this place again during earlier hours to try their other meat choices.",

The barbecue sauce had a good flavor, but a little too sweet for perfection and not spicy enough. I got the stock flavor and did not ask for options so partially my fault. My wife loved it so much she ate the trio burger without missing a step. I had the meatloaf with an extra side of Mac and cheese. The portions are a good size and get a free dessert with a check in. The staff also seemed to care about their product and asked me three times how I was doing.  Would definitely recommend and return.",

Let me start off by clarifying that this awesome restaurant is NOT in the ghetto.  It is in an industrial area.....big difference.  We found it to be clean and very comfortable!  Great service.....they made you feel welcomed, like you are a part of the family.    We had the 4 meat combo with 3 sides and the hot wings.  All items were super yummy!  The brisket was moist and basically melted in your mouth!  The ribs fell off the bone and were very tasty!  My boyfriend is addicted to wings.  He could not stop raving about their wings!  Next time, we plan on trying the \"damn hot\" version.  The hot link sausage and chicken were delicious also!  But let me tell you about these addictive corn nuggets!!!!  Woohoo!!!!  Sweet and yummy bites of heaven!!!  YOU must absolutely try these morsels of yummy goodness!  We will definitely return for more!!!  Thanks guys!",

The man said he would bring out the house BBQ sauce and some type of sweet BBQ sauce. I did not like either sauce and this should have been an inclination of what was to come. I ordered the two meat plate with pulled chicken and pulled pork and for my side I chose the baked beans. 10 minutes later my food was ready. First, I tried the pulled pork and the pulled chicken and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ sauce that I had at home to spruce up the meat. Next, I tried the baked beans. The beans were good, I liked the chunks of brisket and I think their house BBQ sauce tastes better when it is cooked into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible. I took one bite and that was it, all I could taste was nutmeg. Still in search of good BBQ in Las Vegas and that includes the sides as well.",

I had fried okra, even though it's not listed on the menu. I found the collards a bit on the salty side. Love the selection of sauces to choose from- even had North and South Carolina sauces.",

However, comparing to other places we've eaten BBQ around the country and at home in AZ, it's not even close.  It was decent food.  Just a little over peppered and a bit dry.  I had the rib sampler.  Had beef, spare, and baby backs.  Beef was very dry, very fatty.  Best of the 3 were the baby backs.  They too were a bit dry as well.  My wife had the duo.  Hers was dry as well.  The brisket she couldn't finish because of how strong the peppering was.  Next time in Vegas, we'll try elsewhere if we want some Q.",

It's off the strip in an industrial area, but it is SO WORTH leaving the strip to try this restaurant.  When we arrived, Dusty was at the smoker & spent a few minutes showing it to us & chatting. I ordered the pork BBQ & beef brisket & it was the best I've EVER had & we have had BBQ all over the south.  The sauce was terrific, but the meat was so good, it didn't need sauce, so I ate 1/2 with & 1/2 without.  My son was excited to have good ol' sweet tea since we now live in Utah & it's hard to find.  The banana pudding was the best I've ever had at a restaurant & truly tasted like grandma made it.  Dusty joined us again & chatted some more, showing us the overflow room & the cool cooker fish tank built by the guys from Tanked.  All in all, it was one of the highlights of our Vegas trip.  Can't wait to go back!!!",

We have tried all of the meats they have to offer. The ribs are decent and the hot links are quite tasty. The brisket and chicken are also above average. The sides are extremely good at least most of them. Corn nuggets are really delicious and sides like loaded mash, dirty rice, and baked beans are flavorful and we'll prepared. The winner here is the service. The owners regularly come out to check on tables. All of the staff is attentive, kind, and welcoming. Both times we have been asked where we are from, and explained the restaurants style and philosophy. My kids are always given stickers and pens and treated as guests rather than burdens. I will continue to support these guys because they create really good food and make service as important as the flavors they achieve.",

Their BBQ is possibly the best I've ever had. The beef ribs are out of this world. Lord, the Jalapeno cole slaw?!? and those cream corn poppers?!??...need I say more? It's a hidden gem just off the strip. Plenty of parking and seating inside. The service is great, everyone is friendly. I've been three times now and the last time I decided to be a hero and take an order back to my family in LA. The waiters carefully packed my meal in a foil carrier and even added dessert as a bonus. I've had the pleasure of meeting the chef and his wife, they are very passionate about their restaurant and you can taste it in the food. I LOVE THIS PLACE. YOU MUST VISIT....thank me later. I can no longer visit my grandparents in Vegas without stopping here...oh and maybe hitting a slot machine or two ;)",

I would certainly recommend the beef ribs.  They were fantastic and meaty.  The service was prompt.  This is a dive so don't expect a fabulous setting, but we knew that going in.

    "text": "Let me start by saying the food was good, once I got it.  I came here for a business lunch with the rest of my coworkers from my office. I ordered The Outlaw Burger, and I ordered 2nd out of our line of 7 people.  We all went to sit outside and wait for our food. Fast forward a bit to after everyone else has their food, I decide to go in and see what's up with my order.  The lady checks my ticket and goes to see where it is. She comes back and tells me \"it'll be right out\". I wait another 10 minutes and see many other orders come out, but not my order. I ask again and she checks again, then tells me \"just a couple more minutes\". 10 minutes later I ask her \"am I going to get a burger today?\", so she checks again. 5-10 minutes after that she comes out and says \"they have it on now\".  A full hour after I ordered, after all my coworkers have finished their lunch, and after every other table in the place received their order, they finally bring my burger out. I had to take it to go, since I spent my whole lunch break waiting for it.  The guy who brought it out was nice and threw in some fries, but I was upset at that point. I paid $13 for a burger, even left a good tip when I signed the receipt thinking I'll be the nice guy who tips at these places, and the lady who caused all of this didn't even attempt to apologize.  Needless to say, even though the food was decent, they just lost business from 7 locals, out of which I was overly excited to try the food here.  We most likely will never be back.  Thanks for the fries, mr. server.",

It was tough to pick one thing to get so we shared the pit plate. Pulled pork, tri-tip and ribs. Sides were Mac-cheese, greens, cole slaw and corn bits! Everything was so good. The smoke ring on the ribs were pure perfection and everything tasted great. They have this burger that is the size of a football and looks awesome, but it would take a REALLY big stomach or to be shared by two.   It was too hard to find and it has lots of seating. Staff was awesome!!! Will return the next time we hit Vegas!",

Before you even walk into the place you can smell the barbeque, like the smoke is just rolling towards you...  So hey! The name is quite fitting.  Anyways, if it smelled that delicious already before even walking in through the door, then I knew it was going to be a good time.  The menu was very extensive, but ultimately I decided to order the Rib and Chicken Combo with the waffle fries.  The meal was massive!  Now usually there's something to be said on quality vs. quantity, but this place most definitely had both down, and the price was good.  The ribs were so juicy and tender, and peeled right off the bone.  The chicken also was juicy and delicious, and the skin was well flavored with great texture.  I barely managed to finish it all and hardly left any room for the fries.  Needless to say, I didn't need to eat again for the rest of the day and my stomach was quite satisfied.  A lot of locals drop by here, and now I can see why.  Plus, it's more fun to mingle with them and get off the strip for a little while to try some real flavor. The staff was very friendly and the food came out lickety split.  Overall, it was an awesome experience and probably one of the best BBQ I had ever tasted.  The only negative I had was that they didn't serve any alcohol.  I will be back!",

For a single person eating lunch, with a sandwich, side and a drink and you're close to $20. If you get a meat combo or such, that'll push it up even more. That being said, the stuff is good. The signs all say Alabama BBQ, not sure what that means but it's good! One caveat...when you leave this place all of your clothing will smell like smoke for the rest of the day. Sauces are good too, they have several to choose from, the house and the Carolina vinegar are my faves. They have a hot one too, that is pretty spicy. Also, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy, its in the shadow of the DI super arterial.",

    "text": "I travel a lot for business and I always make it a point to find great local restaurants.  This time I was traveling with my family and we ended up in Vegas.   This is a must visit. It is easy to spend the entire time eating on the strip but this is only 10 minutes away.  It is definitely worth the trip.  The beef ribs were cooked perfectly.  The burnt ends were moist and tasty. The baked beans and yams were also great side dishes.  Did not try any of the pork products but I am sure they were the same or better.   The place is very informal.  You order and pay on a line then site at one of the picnic tables either inside or outside.  They will bring the food to you.  The staff is great, friendly, and as I was ordering for 5 strong willed people they were patient too.",

    "text": "Okay I have got to say I am EXTREMELY satisfied with the service. The story was that me and 2 other friends ordered the $50 sampler plate and were extremely dissatisfied with what we were given. The actual plate looked nothing like the photo. The plate we received was probably half of what was shown in the Yelp photo. When we compared it to the duo plates my other friends got (which were less than $20 each) the size of our plate wasn't that much bigger than theirs. When I went up to question the cashier about it, he told me that the uploaded Yelp photo was meant for Photoshoot and the quantity was exaggerated for photo purposes. And then he proceeded to tell me that the sampler plate we got is what they actually intended to serve. At that point I was extremely upset with the False advertisement and started giving the cashier attitude. In my head I was thinking \"you scams......we are definitely leaving you guys 5 one star reviews.\" However, instead of taking it in negatively, the cashier took it really well. He told us he can solve the problem and will just give us more food to make up for it. The amount of food they brought out afterwards definitely exceeded what was shown in the Yelp photo. Our whole party really appreciated the awesome customer service and yummy food. We are also very satisfied with how fast the foods were brought out. It definitely went from a potentially bad dining experience to a very positive one! I would like to thank the staffs for making this dining experience so pleasant.",

However, if you never order anything except the CORN BREAD it's all you really need in life. Light, fluffy, buttery perfect. Can double as a dessert. Why? It's the perfect finish. Having said that, I got the recommended peach cobbler. Ahhhhhhhhh......good choice. We ordered corn bread to go. :) Yep. Shout out to Matt, great guy, nice smile. The staff was super. We even met the Pit Master. This staff wants one thing-for you to really like the food and have a great experience. My regret? We didn't eat every meal here. I am crying because we have nothing that comes close to this. A family member has travelled all over and said the only thing that comes close is in San Antonio. Please, do this. Any wait is worth it.",

They fall right off the bone yet still retains a nice bite that you would want to get from a good piece of meat. Their sides are also really good the cheesy mac is super creamy and cheesy.   The prices here are also pretty good. I would not consider it cheap but its a good value for the quality and amount of food you get.   Service here is really good too. Everybody is really nice and helpful. Sometimes when it gets really busy it gets a little chaotic due to the tight space they have but you can still tell everybody there is giving it their all to try and provide the best service they can.",

    "text": "The night before, I had dinner at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars. Their brisket was dry...so I decided to venture forth for better smoked meat.   Yelp led me to Rollin Smoke.   This place is the definition of a hole in the wall (which made the contrast with the Bacchanal Buffet all the more pronounced). There's a strip club two doors down. Do not judge the book by its cover.  I ordered at the counter and got the 3-meat combo (brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs) with a side of onion strings and a piece of catfish. Everything was incredibly delicious. The pork rib, particularly, stood out among the meats  - tons of meat, falling-off-the-bone, great smoked flavor.   But the catfish was the star. There was a delicious coarse cornbread breading...like a hushpuppy around the fish. Unreal!  Maybe it was because I was eating alone, but there was something magical and welcoming about the atmosphere (a weird word to use for a hole-in-the-wall...) There was a stuffed boar watching me from the corner; i filled up my soda club in a dark closet, but the whole thing was unaccountably perfect.   One of the DJs from the strip club came in and ate the taller, biggest burger I've ever seen. The two of us chatted with one of the other patrons about how great the BBQ is here. The owner (manager?) noticed that I had done a Yelp checkin and gave me a free dessert (I hadn't even asked). And just as soon as I was wondering how I was going to get back to Caesars...a cabdriver walked in to check out the place.   I really wanted to go back the next night to try the beef ribs and maybe the baked beans, but alas...it wasn't in the cards.  My mouth is watering for my next trip to Vegas.   One small note: Rolling Smoke closes kind of early (8 or 8:30) during the week, but it's open late on Fri and Sat.   Go there now. You won't be sorry.",

The brisket was good & so we're the hot links & brisket. The one thing I was not such a fan of was their ribs. I'm very picky with my ribs BUT the customer service we received was beyond our expectations! My bf & myself work in customer service so we both know how crucial it is to meet certain expectations, but everyone there was extremely nice & welcoming specially Brenda she was very helpful in letting us know what to get since they have so many options to choose from.

I've been to the road kill grill, pot liquor, and many more chain style locations in the valley, this is the best overall. I've never had a main dish here that i thought was just \"ok.\" For the people saying it's not the best in Las Vegas, please offer up your alternatives then. They have a tone of variety of sauces but honestly the ribs and pulled pork could be enjoyed without any sauce and still be amazing.",

Limited seating so u may have to take ur meal to go during busy times. Fashion show mall is nearby so go eat there and cool off with their air conditioner. The BBQ Sauce is the star of the meal here. It's on the tangy side and there is a bottle of it at your table so u can add as much or as little as u like. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly.

There was a long line which wasn't a surprise since it was lunch time.  What was surprising is after about a 20 min wait in line you find out when you place your order it'll be another 20 min. I only ordered a brisket sandwich,  so I don't know why that would take 20 min. But it did.  What was very disappointing is the sandwich was cold when I finally got it.  Also the brisket was not anything special.  I was at Sin City Smokers recently and that brisket was much better. More like real BBQ, not high volume BBQ.  Given Rolling Smokes reputation I thought I'd try the Summerlin location since it wouldn't be as busy.   I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich.  The meat was not chopped,  it was mushy and had the texture of bad pulled pork.  Not much meat on the bun for $10.99. I won't be back.  The real pain is this last visit was my 'cheat' day. I've been eating well and losing weight so I thought I'd treat myself to a nice brisket sandwich.  GRRRR!",

I ordered the duo combo which comes with choice of two meats and a side. I got the brisket, hot links, and potato salad. Brisket was nice and juicy - hot links were savory - potato salad was very tasty with bacon pieces and pepper. To top it all off, I tried Blue Bell ice cream for the very first time and it was a great sweet finish to my meal.   TIP: Don't go at 12 unless you have time to stay. First time I went, the line was out the door! I only had an hour lunch break so I came back a few days later after 1PM and had plenty of time.",

Not convenient to a lot of different traffic, but good for the workers all along Highland Dr. The restaurant is extremely casual with picnic tables inside and outside. There was an additional room with seating off to the side, but I did not peek in.   Service:  the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Chef Will was awesome! He noticed I was staring at the menu for a very long time, so he asked if it was my first time here. Then he proceeded to go through the menu with me, and even let me taste a few things before ordering. What great customer service!!!!!!  Food: I really wish I could give the food a higher rating, but it was just not as good as I hoped. The corn nuggets were delicious!  The pulled pork and beef ribs were pretty good too. But the jalapeno cole slaw tasted more like black pepper cole slaw. The bacon potato salad was good, but too many onions for me. The biggest problem was I got my food to go and there wasn't any BBQ sauce in my bag. Not sure if that's standard and you have to ask for some or they just forgot it. Either way, it just wasn't BBQ without the sauce.   Overall:  amazing customer service, and good food, by not great. I'd come back with friends, but I'd try something different next time.",

This place puts the other BBQ places in town like Memphis Championship and Famous Dave's (Famous Who?, now) to shame. Their sweet tea is the bomb!  John even convinced me to eat something different tonight, because I always get the same thing otherwise, so I tried their Outlaw Burger. I think Wilford Brimley wants to have a word with me about Diabeetus or something now, because I ate way too much. Enjoyed every bite, though!  Good luck to the Yelpers participating in the rib eating contest tomorrow!",

Was craving some bbq late sat. night and saw that this places closes at 1:30am! Hollah! Its off of South Highland and if you're like me, I discerned the location to be close to Spearmint Rhino. When we got there looked a lil sketchy on the outside but saw that they had these huge smokers out in the parking lot. Walked in, the lady was really nice suggested some things. I got the ribs, 2 BIG A$$ ribs and a side of fried okra. THE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD. Thats it. you can stop reading and go getchur grub on. I've never had ribs that meaty and juicy before and even the fried okra was fried to perfection. And it was all for $13!! please don't raise your prices Rollin Smoke! Apparently there was a rib eating contest that same day, bummed I missed it! So thankful to have found some southern bbq here in the city. No longer going to Famous Dave's!",

The rolls were nothing fancy, but just a good fresh roll.  All the meats were tasty too.  I had this place marked in my to try forever, but now we will definitely stop in to finish trying the menu.  The meats all included BBQ chicken, sausage, ribs and something pulled.  Not even sure what it was.  Very smoky, flavorful and moist.   And mashed potato were served loaded and were tasty as well.",

Their pork baby back ribs has an excellent smoky flavor to it and the meat is very tender. It isn't quite fall off the bone but nonetheless it is very tasty. The prices aren't too bad either and the quality of the food puts it above Famous Dave's. The baked bean sides is about average but the macaroni and cheese is quite creamy and smooth. The noodles they use for it is different and the cheese isn't as sharp. It's more of a mellow flavor. The macaroni and cheese isn't bad, it is simply different.  The portions unfortunately aren't large for a two meat combo.  The service here is excellent with a friendly staff that is attentive and kind. The decor here also is neat as it represents the hole-in-the-wall kind of grimy joint.  I would eat here again.",

We chose mac n cheese, corn nuggets and loaded mashed potatoes as our sides. I LOVED the mashed potatoes, they were the perfect guilty pleasure. My favorite of the five meats was the brisket. Oh and they have a bunch of sauces, from vinegar sauce to mustard sauce to hot sauce. There is indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside on one of the long picnic benches and it was perfect. Chef Willie brought us a delicious dessert...it was some sort of apple tart topped with vanilla ice cream.

You literally can taste the smoke off this meat.....& boy do I like that. So we tried the beef brisket sandwich with the spiced mac & cheese as the side. My sister and bro-in-law got the wings and the trio. Everything was so darn yummy!!! SAVORY!   The service rocks and I can't help but talk with a Southern drawl with these Alabaman owners. It made me miss the South so whenever I feel nostalgic I know to come here.",

    "text": "Yes Virginia, there is a barbeque place in Vegas!  I kept reading reviews on this place and finally got out there to try it. I escaped work for a bit and hit it for lunch. I lived in NC for several years and really missed having great barbeque. This has filled the void.  First the meat, I had pulled pork sandwich and my husband had two meat option, pulled pork and brisket. They were both awesome! Cooked nicely on the smokers outside, just enough sauce, not too much, perfect smokey flavor.  Next time I will try the links.  The sides were terrific too. So many places seem to haves sides as an after thought but not here. I had jalapeno coleslaw. It had a nice kick, not too much mayo, super flavorful. Husband had the beans. So good with extra chunks of meat and a smokey flavor. We were both stuffed at the end. All very affordable too! Two meat special, two sides, sandwich combo including drinks for both just $22.  With the great weather I wish they had more tables outside. I could lounge out there and smell the smokers all afternoon. I also wish they could sell beer since that pairs so nicely with barbeque. But that great meat trumps those issues.   I've been to the other places in town and this one blows them away. We will be back soon!",

Me and my husband didn't know what to pick, there was way to many good choices. The guy asked us simple questions like \"do you like spicy food, do you eat pork & how hungry are you\". He ordered us so many different delicious things that me and my husband couldn't finish it. Even tho there's no hostess you can ask for a tray for your leftovers so that was a plus being that it was a bit pricey (Free refills on soft drinks). Seating is first come or whatever is available there is an outside area to eat as well. GREAT STAFF, GREAT GOOD!",

The second time however the service was ABSOLTUTELY HORRID. They took over an hour to bring out our food. The entire time they never put our order in due to horrible miscommunication that the server made us feel as if it was our fault! The guy even had an attitude. One of the mgrs on duty tried to offer banana pudding  without even knowing i dont like bananas. I even noticed him having some of his thumb in another customers dessert while he dropped it off! So all in all because of the food itself I round up 3.5 to 4. Hopefully the next time we wont have such horrible experience because it is so hard to find great BBQ in Vegas.",

I was still in the mood for more when we got back to Vegas, and we found this place on Yelp.  The spudtastic was A MAZ ing!  Loaded with pulled pork (my g/f got brisket on hers and loved it too), shredded cheddar, sour cream and onions.  I actually ordered the $24.99 all-you-can-eat.  I couldn't believe it at first, but it really was as much of anything on the menu as you can eat, as long as you eat what you order.  Awesome deal!  My only regret - not going with a bigger appetite because I was too full to try the desserts.  We'll definitely be going back for more baby ribs, more potato salad, more spuds and dessert...OH, and the meatloaf was great (and I'm not a meatloaf person)!  Thanks to the guys at Rollin Smoke!",

I can't believe I never heard about this place until my friend showed me where it is. Don't be fooled by the location, on the outside it may look like you're not even from Vegas at all and you'll contemplate why you're there, but the moment you step inside, it felt like I was actually in Arkansas and the overall vibe was awesome! All I ever saw when I walked in was all the awards that this place got. Not to mention the service was excellent! David (the guy who took our order) is literally the most helpful guy who can explain the best options to get for the menu. We got the \"Rib Special Platter\" (27.99 after taxes) but everything on it was enough to feed at least 2 people and we were a party of 5 so we all shared and pitched in for the food. I can tell you right now, the food was so appealing and mouth watering that when you see it being served, I felt like an animal ready to attack it's prey. LMAO. I was just that hungry to be honest and I've never been so happy and impressed with the service. David complemented me and Daniela (my friend) and just gave us super funny compliments about our names saying I had a cool name and she had a beautiful name. We just bursted out laughing and I swear I couldn't forget that moment. Working in the food industry also for Las Vegas, it reminded me a lot about how much we work so hard in the industry to make sure our customers have the best experience. I have to say this place has really lived up to the standard and as a fellow worker in the food and beverage industry, I salute the men and women who work hard in this. They really give you a one of kind hospitality and make you laugh haha. Maybe it's just the southern hospitality, but you have to experience it to really have a great time. Not to mention this place is perfect for sharing and the food is instagram worthy!!!! I swear I'm coming back to this place now to take girls out on dates and stuff just because it's so unique and fun. Anyways I've had enough to say. I really liked this place and you won't be disappointed.",

Not fall off the bone tender since the skin is cooked rather well but remains juicy. My favorite part of the meal though was the mash. Not to take away from other parts of the meal, this was just that garlicky, bacon infused, cheesyness good. Def worth it.",

I brought this problem up to the person behind the counter and was told someone would be right over to help me. No one came.

To round out my meal was the loaded mash and I added some greens. I won't be hungry again until at least this time tomorrow!!  Rollin' Smoke's rub compliments the flavor of both the beef and spare ribs nicely. I added a little of their spicy BBQ sauce because I like my BBQ to have a bit of a kick. The spareribs were perfect and the beef ribs were very impressive. Smokey but not overpowering. Dusty came to my table and asked how everything was, and I couldn't compliment him enough. He shared his technique on how he preps the beef ribs. I guess I'll be back, because I certainly don't have that kind of patience!!  If you're in Vegas craving BBQ, this is the place to go. The portions are big, the prices extremely fair, and the atmosphere removes you from the strip and puts you in a True BBQ joint that you leave smelling smokey! This is real BBQ and not that over salty crap that Famous guy prepares in several spots around town.",

The smoke on the ribs and brisket really packed on the flavor, not to mention the meat was so tender. If you want to send your tastebuds on a cheesy adventure, snag that mac and cheese. When it comes to the sauces, I recommend trying them all but 100% do NOT skip the Country Girl. That poured over the pulled pork was dynamite. Top all this off with staff that were friendly and down-to-earth. I'd call this a sure-fire winner. I'll definitely be back!",

Food served on plastic baskets lined with paper and because of the moisture, the paper disintegrated which means I probably ate some paper with my food. Overall, I think this was one of the best barbecue surprises in the Las Vegas area. Stuffed baked potato with burnt ends was delicious. We also tried ribs, brisket and coleslaw. Everything was delicious. This was not a cheap meal though! This experience comes second to eating tacos at el tacos Gordo on the strip....",

Can't even begin to explain how juicy and savory the ribs are, with or without their sauce.  Ooh yeah and their sauce. Man do they have a wide variety. You can go with the regular bbq sauce, spicy, vinegary sauce, sweet bbq sauce and many, many more.  They also have great options for sides. I personally like the dirty rice and it goes so well with the meat selections. You have a choice of getting the 2 meat or 3 meat choice. My favorite are the ribs so I get two orders of that and if I'm really hungry I'll get the briskets as well. The 2 choice is about $13 bucks while the 3 choice is around $18.  The waiting time can be a bit long but it's not crazy. The parking lot is small and sometimes you need to park across the street.  All in all, love this bbq joint and I highly recommend it!",

Not dry, over cooked, over salted, taking hours to get your food. This place actually had a great, not good, great mac and cheese. On mama's top 3 mac cheeses I've had. Just behind my wife's and my mom's when she's in her bag. And that is big for me to say. Most BBQ restaurants gave trash sides and if you had their mac and cheese you just wanted to cry after. But this almost gave me tears of joy. Now on to that BBQ. Their sauces are killer. They have different versions depending on the meats you get to pair more appropriately with your dish or pallet. Some people can't handle the smoke and I won't judge you for it. When I went I got brisket and short ribs and was not disappointed in the least bit. The only thing I wish was that I was hungrier so I could have tried their hot link. No joke I have only ever had one good hot link in my life and I was hoping this place could fill that void in my heart. I wish you guys could move a location to L.A.",

    "text": "One of the best barbecue places I've ever been to!  When you walk in the door, follow the path on the right to get to the register and place your order. They have a large menu behind the register but they also have individual ones hanging on the wall for you to look at while waiting in line.   I was really tempted to get AYCE (all you can eat) for $34.99. You start off with three meats and then keep going til your heart's content. What was enticing about it was that beef ribs are included and the AYCE is equivalent to a full rack in price. I told myself to be rational. \"You JUST got to Vegas. There's so many places you want to eat at today. Don't jeopardize that by tapping out at the first restaurant.\"  Using my head, I ordered a 1/2 rack of beef ribs but then self-control went out the window when I also ordered the brisket 3 ways. I figured my daughter and I can share; don't judge. = p My husband went with the duo of choice of meats; he chose chicken and spareribs.   I sorely underestimated the size of the beef ribs. See, I'm from the SF Bay Area and in my experience, it's been difficult to find places that serve decent beef ribs, or beef ribs at all for that matter. There are 2 places I found and well, they weren't very meaty at all. I ain't trying to pay for for mostly all bones.   Anyways, I was full from one rib and a couple pieces of burnt ends. My daughter couldn't even finish one rib. By the way, they fell right off the bone and were fork-tender. Dip some in a bit of sweet country sauce, and oh my. So gooood! Side note, the sweet country sauce wasn't even sweet. It was thin and more on the mustardy/vinegary side, which I prefer over sweet bbq sauces.   My husband took a bite of chicken and murmured \"oh my god.\" He then took a bite of his spareribs and made a noise of appreciation. He was pretty much non-communicative for the rest of his mea, which didn't last very long because he devoured that ish.   We got a chance to meet Chef Will. He was super nice! Hats off to you, Chef!",

We ordered to-go and had to wait about 20-30 minutes for our order, as it seemed to be quite busy. The layout of the restaurant was a bit odd, so we awkwardly stood in the center, where there was the only open space, while we waited.  Overall, the meat, while all tender, was not as flavorful as I would expect. I tried the brisket, sausage, and chicken. The barbeque sauces themselves were very flavorful, with a hint of some complex spices that really made them stand out, so if you doused everything in the sauce it was tasty. For the sides, the mac and cheese was more on the creamy side rather than cheesy which I wasn't a huge fan of. The bacon mashed potatoes were excellent; with the cheese and onions on top, they were delicious! The cornbread was also good, soft with melted butter on top.  Overall decent food for the price, but not what I expected of the 'best BBQ in Vegas'. I also did not enjoy the wait for our to-go order.",

Our experience left a lot to be desired as our ribs were tough, pork was fatty with no taste and chicken was very dry. We decided then to not come back.  Fast forward two years and WOW, what a difference, This food is dynamite!!!  Let me start with my favorite menu item, the beef ribs. These things are insane tender with a ton of flavor yet simple, literally fall of the bone, fall apart in your mouth and moist with a great pink smoke ring. The server that brought my food told me it was like \"prime rib on a stick\" and boy was he right! Bring your appetite if you order these, they are huge.  Brisket is darn good as well. Great flavor, nice deep smoke ring and thinly sliced. I have been back three times in the last two weeks (Hi my name is Paul and I'm addicted to good Q) and I have yet to get any point, only flat. I one day will ask them if they are smoking full packers or just the flats. If you ever get the opportunity to get smoked brisket point don't pass it up, it's heaven! (Point brisket is where the \"burnt ends\" come from)   Pulled pork is good, but this is where they lost that coveted fifth star from me. I know it's tough to please everyone ( I have been doing BBQ catering for years) but I believe it's a big part of pulled pork to have a finishing sauce added when you pull the shoulder to add that extra level of flavor. I use a home made clear eastern Carolina style finisher on mine and everyone loves it.   In all this is the best Q restaurant in the valley bar none and I am so happy to see a fellow pit master doing well on his own. While my co workers and I ate lunch today ( 5-1-14 ) the line of people went out the door and never let up the hour we were here. Rock on Rollin Smoke, keep doing it right, you have a loyal customer in me, but only when I'm not doin my own stuff!",

    "text": "Not worth the money at all. Basically they overcharge for bad service and regular bbq. No real reason this place costs 15 bucks a plate. On top of that they messed up my order. They paid for an ad on the radio which is why so many people think they are great and they have a good burger which I won't be tasting because I will never go back. The Po-Boy left much to be desired, the blueberry cobbler tasted like a 10 year old made it in elementary school, and I never tasted the mac and cheese because they never brought it to me. Even tho I paid for it. If you are going to charge me an arm and a leg (Considering the quality) and not have the food be worth the price, they should have at least gotten my order correct. I didn't even bother to bring it up to them because I didn't want to bother with the mac and cheese after the rest of my meal not being impressive at all. If you want to post on social media that you went an expensive place then this is the spot. If you want something worth the money then go somewhere else. You may not be able to brag about spending 40 dollars on a meal but at least you would get full. I would give zero stars but Yelp won't let me. This place was trash.",

Don't even have to tip and you can quickly eat and leave if you're pressed for time, rather than having to wait on someone to refill your drink and bring you the bill. This is similar to a fast food spot in those aspects, line up to order and pay. When your food is ready, they'll bring it out like a sit-down restaurant and call your name.   Prices are reasonable.   Outlaw burger: it was good but nothing amazing. Lots of onion straws.   BBQ nacho fries: I like the waffle structure of the fries, it gives it a different texture.

    "text": "Talk about a hole in the wall foodie's secret! Neither the bellhop at the hotel nor the taxi driver had  heard of this place and we had to pull out our smart phones to map the way there. Located in a semi-industrial area that's just 10 minutes away from the strip, it took a bit of convoluted driving to actually get there. It's not a fancy place, simple benches, plastic utensils, noisy, with an order counter and serve your own drinks, but oh man... the food... the food! (They also have sweetened tea - have to have that in a Southern BBQ place, right? Right??)  This place was suggested by a couple of local friends when I was visiting and we met up for dinner. We got what I think was the \"Pit special\" which was the variety platter, 5 meats and 3 sides - Pulled pork,1/4  chicken, hot links, ribs and brisket - an extra order of the corn nuggets - think of tater tots made with kernels of corn and corn meal, green beans and coleslaw. The slaw was good but we had to dole out the corn nuggets to be fair or any one of us would have hogged them all.  Best Southern BBQ I've had in a long, long while - so good I did not try any of the other sauces - they make several - on the meat. They did not drown everything in sauce either, but encouraged you to try the various sauces. Crisp, well seasoned chicken skin, saucy (but not too saucy) pulled pork, ribs with just the right amount of char, tender brisket, spicy links... it was all good.  Then it was time for dessert and the chef was walking around talking to customers and we asked about dessert, with a friend asking if \"Mama's Banana Puddin\" was made of real custard. Hoo boy, you'd think we just insulted his Momma. \"You think I would use box vanilla pudding? Man, you gotta stand there and stir that custard by hand or it ain't good! That's the only way you can make Banana puddin!\"  We settled on the banana pudding and the blackberry cobbler and shared - because we were so full from dinner (and we had left overs to take home) - we scraped those bowls clean! Talk about greed... I was tempted to get another! The Banana custard was smooth and tasty, the consistency of the custard just perfect - none of that grainy fake pudding mix in that!. The cobbler topping was not overly sweetened which let the blackberry taste shine through.  Altogether, a wonderful gustatory experience - and the cost for this wonderful experience? Oh... about $12 each.",

Here's what I thought,,,IF the pulled pork had been HOT it would have been a great sandwich.  Sauce was flavorful, bun fresh, but I don't like warm food so that's why I'm giving it only a 4 star review.  Potatoe salad was wonderful.  Prices fair, but don't forget if you are staying on the strip, it will cost you 17.00 R/T on Uber.  Also, NO atmosphere.  Just a room full of tables.  Kinda disappointing. Next time I'll try Gilleys at T.I. or I Love This Bar, where I've had the Pork and it was good, plus walking distance and great music if you love Toby Keith.",

Had I have known it would have been that long of a wait time, I would have left. The order taker was not very friendly and did not make a good first impression. She seemed rushed and annoyed that she was taking orders, even though I already knew what I wanted and only asked one question about the pies.   After waiting an hour in a half for our food, I was really hoping for amazing barbecue. In fact, I was so hungry at that point, I didn't think I could tell the difference. Anything seemed like it would have been yummy. But, I was wrong. I could definitely tell that the food was just okay. Definitely NOT worth an hour in a half wait.   Ribs were good, hot links were good, but the chicken, pulled pork, and chopped brisket were bland. I had to drown it in sauce to make it worth eating. And even drowning it in the sauces (I tried all the sauces), it still did not help the flavor get any better. The baked beans were average, the corn nuggets - I did like and would say is above average. The coleslaw was mehhhh. Not impressed.   One of the order takers was 'smart mouthing' customers who complained about the wait on their food. i was appalled. I kept my mouth shut. But, customer after customer steamed with frustration after their wait time pushed way pass 45 minutes, then an hour, then an hour in a  half. What was more frustrating is the order takers were still quoted a 25 minute wait on food, when they knew full well the kitchen was backed up to over an hour. I have no idea how this place got such stellar reviews and no one mentioned the crazy wait.    I love BBQ and for the past few days I had been going to Famous Dave's. After this ridiculous wait at Rollin Smoke Barbeque, I'd rather go to Famous Daves. The food at Famous Dave's is just as good. In fact, what I ordered there was quite possibly a tad bit better. The atmosphere, service, sauces, and speed of food trumps Rollin Smoke Barbeque any day!   At Famous Dave's, the wait was only 15 minutes for our feast for 6 people. In my opinion, a 15 minute wait for a feast of 6 is totally worth it. Plus, there was so much food we had left overs. The feast for 6 comes out to be $11 a person (if you have 6 people) and was so well worth every penny and every bite.",

I ordered the \"super sampler\"!  The ribs were my favorite. Tender, smoky, and the BBQ rub has just the right amount of flavor.  The pulled pork with the sweet bread is a great combo.  Spicy sausage has just the right amount of heat.  The sides were good, especially that potato salad with bacon! Wow!

Hubby had the ALL YOU CAN EAT for $35 And it's literally all you can eat but within an hour or so. His BEEF RIBS were huge and not because of the bone it was all meat he said they were delicious, they looked like it. He also tried the brisket, catfish, shrimp and peach cobbler among other sides it was all FANTASTIC. One of the owners John (I think) came to ask how we were and when I tell you this gentleman was the friendliest manager/co owner an establishment could have.

    "text": "It's been a while since I've been to Rolling Smoke, and time has not been kind to what used to be one of my favorite BBQ places in Vegas or West of Kansas City for that matter.   My wife and I decided to give them another try and $40 later, much of what we ordered is sitting in a styrofoam box in the fridge and will likely end up in the dog bowl or put in the trash. We ordered a combo plate with 5 choices of meat and 3 sides along with something to drink. Service is not a problem, the staff was as friendly as ever and our food arrived in 5 minutes as promised. But from there, things kinda went downhill quickly.   I'm curious as to why Rolling Smoke doesn't put bottles of sauce on the tables anymore? You get to choose from 6 big bottles of sauce at the side counter that you pour into small white paper cups...and the labels on the sauces don't tell you very much about how hot, spicy, or sweet they are. You kinda have to experiment with the sauces and we ended up trying them all. And the sauces didn't impress us at all. They were kind of blah and on the watery side, to be honest.   While the chicken was cooked to perfection, the ribs were a little on the thin side and had a little too much fat left on them. We substituted a meat choice to double up on the ribs...which I regret doing. And they didn't even properly cut them either so we had to pull them apart. But the cardinal sin in my book is the brisket. It was cut way too thin and the worst part was the 1.5 inches of fat left on the end of all of the strips. I wanted brisket, not fat, and to me it seems like someone just doesn't care too much about the quality of the product being sent out of the kitchen these days.   And one more thing. BBQ beans should not be overwhelmed by excessive black pepper. I have never been served BBQ beans anywhere in America that left me tasting the pepper to such an extent that the beans and thin pieces of meat came across as more of an afterthought.   The bottom line for my wife and I is we don't intend to go back. I would much rather pay to ship in BBQ from Kansas City than to go back to Rolling Smoke.   In short, it sure ain't what it used to be. Not even close. 1 Star. I hate writing 1 Star reviews but I can't honestly give Rolling Smoke anything more. And that's sad as I used to love this place and visited it as often as 3 times per week for years.",

We have a frustrating time ordering our food because we tried to decided what types of meat we want & the different sides we wanted. We got to the cashier and they said that if we order AYCE its only \"3 meats and 2 sides\" but that means you can only get 2 pcs of ribs, which are small portions at a time for 1 hr only. Sooo basically NOT everything on the menu.   I suggest just either adding the rules on the menu or getting rid of the AYCE BBQ because the food is good just that the menu is confusing.",

The restaurant itself seems to have several dining areas though for dining in.   You will smell the smoky goodness as soon as you walk in. Line up and place your order at the counter then wait for your food. There are physical menus as well as a big menu posted up on the wall.  I opted for a combo to try multiple meats, and I ordered my food to-go. The meats themselves were succulent and juicy, and packed full of flavor. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but wasn't impressed enough to give an outright five stars.  The prices are medium but pretty much what I expected. I definitely recommend this barbecue place. It is a bit tricky to locate under the overpass, but it is worth the trek!",

It is a little confusing to find this location but once you see the Overhead Bridge, you'll know the place is nearby. Just make sure you take a good look because it's definitely hidden. It's True what they, the restaurant is a hole in the wall. But after having tried a few of their menu items, I am convinced it's a Must-have in Vegas and a Total keeper.  He ordered the Brisket Sliced Spare Ribs with Corn Nuggets ($13.99). I wanted to try a few sides of my own ($3.50 each): Corn Nuggets, Yams, Sweet Corn Bread, Cheesy Mac N Cheese, Waffle Fries, and a Side Salad with chipotle dressing. And for dessert, I shared a Banana Pudding ($4.99) with Vanilla Ice Cream ($2.00).   I felt like I just had a Side Item Sampler with a dip of every barbecue sauce. The Side Salad is good and everything else is flavorful. I love the Crispiness of Waffle Fries and Savory Corn Nuggets with Creamy, Cheesy Mac N Cheese.  The Sweet Corn Bread is moist and fluffy, and it taste amazing with Sweet Potato Yams. My favorite is the Banana Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream. It's just the right amount of sweetness and they even add a hint of Crunchy Vanilla Wafers which makes it so yummy. Did I mention they have Blueberry and Southern Peach Cobbler Pies too! I already love this place.",

I placed a to go order here yesterday thinking 'I really want BBQ, they are on the way home so let me just try them out'. I got two of the 2 meat plates- 1/4 chicken, pork, brisket, ribs with mac and cheese and collards.   This was the best BBQ I have had here in Vegas, hands down. The meat was tender and SO flavorful... and the sauce... man that sauce. I got the House Sauce and it tastes like the sauce my grandfather would make at home to go with the homemade skins(pork skins) he would make.  I definitely give this place my Southern stamp of approval!",

I can honestly say I'm blown away!!!    Let's start with the atmosphere upon walking in, you feel like you've left Vegas and entered the south. The people could not have been any nicer!  They gave us fantastic recommendations (get the smoked meatloaf) and we're not wrong in any of them.   You want to talk about FAST FOOD?!  We had our meals before we even sat down!!    Honestly this place is top notch BBQ and I'd even say it's better than any of the bigger names found in Texas!    We decided we needed to try some dessert so we ordered the peach cobbler and the banana puddin. The cashier told us that the pudding was all out and we were totally bummed...a few minutes later someone came back to our table and said \"wait...I'm going back to make more pudding for you right now!l. What?!!  Are you kidding me?!!!    This place is fantastic!  Everyone came by to make sure we were taken care of and didn't need anything.   If you're ever in Vegas and love BBQ, you MUST come here and patronize them!!!    Thank you for making our trip end on a memorable note!!!!",

    "text": "I came here the other day with my dad and brother under the impression that this place is supposedly \"the best bbq in Las Vegas\". My brother ordered a plate that included a bunch of meat that he could eat/sample with my dad. I had a couple of spare ribs and the mac & cheese. The ribs were decent, but definitely lacked flavor in my opinion. I enjoyed the mac & cheese because- well it was cheesy. I tried one of the sausage slices that came on my brother's meal and that was my favorite thing. It had a lot of flavor and went well with that mustardy sauce. I tried the beans and they were not best by any means, but my brother enjoyed them. One thing I noticed is that all of their sauces had a twist and none of them were \"traditional\", which is a good thing, but I wish I could have had a traditional bbq sauce that I could use for the meat. Maybe they had one, but I didn't see it. Also, the layout of the restaurant was sort of weird, it was just really closed off and the two rooms felt like two different restaurants. The last negative note that I have is that the restroom is right by the kitchen and it had no lock for just being a single restroom. So it's in a small hallway and you're having to walk sideways so you're not in the server's way or whoever's leaving that kitchen. So the no lock thing made me uncomfortable and I had my dad stand outside of the door so no one would enter while I was in there. The restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in days. I understand that the restaurant gets busy sometimes, but that's unacceptable to me. I will end by saying the server/busboy was really helpful and kind. He was cleaning the tables quickly, yet efficiently to let other people sit at the tables. He came by to pick up baskets and clean our table off so that was cool to see. So this place isn't the best bbq in all of Las Vegas, but I would recommend you try it and form your own opinion. It's definitely a decent restaurant, but I wouldn't come racing here every time I visit.",

Smoked sausage and ribs with 2 sides, dirty rice and green beans.  I also ordered a side of corn bread.  We ordered at the register, and proceeded to sit and wait anxiously as our food arrived a short time later.  The sausage was perfectly smoked, generous portion, the ribs were tender and meaty.  The dirty rice, ohhh that dirty rice was tasty, nice flavor and perfect accompaniment to the meet.  The greens beans were perfectly cooked, not too crunch and not at all mushy, and the cornbread was fluffy and sweet.  My husband had the smoked sausage sandwich and enjoyed that as well.

After visiting the restaurant for the first time I have to say it's some of the best BBQ I have ever had. I have visited several BBQ places in Kansas City and this place is right there as some of the best BBQ out there. Even with the food being amazing I have to say the service was even more incredible. Not only was Catrina amazing so was everyone else working that day. I think every employee said hello and thanked us. Definitely recommend this place and will be going back. Thank you Catrina and staff for a wonderful experience",

My husband and I shared a 3 meat combo of chicken, hot sausage, and \"burnt ends\" with bbq beans, dirty rice, and corn nuggets. Everything was spot on in every way!!  And the Arkansas Razorback decor was a fun, unexpected surprise (my husband and I met in Arkansas :)  It is definitely not what I think of as the typical Las Vegas dining experience, but for great barbecue, it's a winner!!!",

Let's be honest, when there is a line full of people trying to order, with all eating areas are full of patrons stuffing their face, you have found a great spot.  If you only like Barbeque, like my girlfriend, you will still want to come back for more.  Christal was amazing, upbeat, and happy to assist everyone that had questions through the ordering process.

I was not very fond of it, however, I also ordered a side of collard greens and that more than made up for my dislike.

There are not many dedicated bbq places in town, so there's not much competition for RS BBQ, hence \"Best BBQ in Vegas\"  and the anointed darling amongst the Yelp community.   The bbq does have a nice smoke ring I give it that, thin pink line, crisp crust, easily pulls off the bone. The bbq hickory smoke aroma in the air is intoxicating and draws  you into this place!  Taste wise it's good, not great. I've had better bbq with better spice rub mix and sauces.    First impression was a hit for the ribs, a miss for the brisket. It was not as moist like our favorite place. Our recent returns here have been good. Although sometimes the ribs are a tad dry. It could be because we got the ones left in the warming trays longer.   They did a nice job expanding the dining area. As far as picnic bench seating; it's great if you are with a large party and you take up the majority of the table. But when you have to share a table with strangers that have no table manners or have poor hygiene, it puts a damper on my dining experience.   The price they charge for what you get is great! That is always the highlight of conversations I've had with other diners and why another reason this place rates high on here. It's cheap! For two meat two side combo meal under $10,  For the amount they charge for decent bbq there's no reason to leave here disappointed. That's why I don't mind coming here.",

The mac and cheese and corn nuggets (cream corn that's deep fried) we're both delicious. Right down to the pickles, this place is the real deal.

The total was around $60 for both of us. This is an order at the counter, seat yourself place which I dont mind at all.   The AYCE special is anything on the menu any day and anytime. The menu consists of a plethora of meats, burgers, sandwiches, sides, and desserts. My bf loaded up on the meats, I think he tried pretty much every meat in the place. Ribs, meatloaf, chicken, pulled pork and wings, just to name a few. His consensus is the meatloaf is bomb and the baby backs are delicious. He enjoyed the other meats as well, but those were his favorite. He had 3 plates each consisting of 3 meats AND sides, so he definitely got his moneys worth. If you have a hearty appetite, AYCE is the way to go.  For my meal, I got a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and spare ribs, and for my side I chose mac & cheese. The food was delicious. I really loved the ribs. They were so tender and meaty and fall off the bone. A good rib needs no sauce, and these did not need any. Speaking of sauce, they have like 5 different bbq sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy. I personally love a good vinegar based sauce, so I enjoyed their Carolina sauce the best. But they have something for everyone. The chopped brisket was yummy too, although I would probably get the brisket sliced next time. The only thing I did not like was the mac and cheese. It was realllly runny and pretty bland, but they have like 10 other sides to choose from. I can't wait to come back for some more yummy BBQ.",

The load baked potato also blew my mind.  They only have one BBQ sauce, gracias a dios, it was really good. I just like a variety of tastes in my mouth... take it as you will. My personal favorites were the sausage and pulled pork. The initial kick of the brisket was good (we got burnt tipped) but I was over it after awhile.   There sides are what really blew my mind. They were all really good, coleslaw, beans, mac n cheese, everything!! They were so good, i recommend all of them. We dropped about 40 dollars which was enough to feed four grown men... or three grown men and me, which is the equivalent of a 13 year old boy. So 3 and a half people.   This is also on the outskirts of the city BUT it is totally worth the trip if you are in the mood for BBQ.  THE VERDICT: Get your BBQ on here... i have not tried anywhere else but... I am pretty sure there are other places but... this is now my place in LV. The sauce will will light up your mouth, and you will not be disappointed. In fact you will be happier than you have been in years... and thats a guarantee.",

The brisket and the chicken were both dry for me. And they tasted sweet. The sides were nothing special,  just alright. The burnt ends were a bit too burnt.

    "text": "This place... Went on Saturday for brunch and decided to come back the next day so I could try something else on their menu and my date wanted to order the same meal he had, but they are closed on Sunday's! Needless to say, BOMB. I mean, we did try to come back the next day! Haha.   I ordered the half rack of spare ribs, naked. Meat was perfect, beautiful smoke rings, meat was tender and juicy and just had great flavor that appreciated the flavor of the ribs itself (like, didn't overpower-ing-ly just taste like seasoning). The half rack was more than enough for me to eat. The side of green beans I had was simple, but flavorful. My date had the smoked meat loaf over mashed potatoes with Mac n cheese. I tried it and it was delicious! Nice smokey flavor, AWESOME SAUCE, meat was moist and perfectly seasoned, mashed potatoes were creamy and a great compliment to the smokiness, the Mac n cheese was very creamy, thick and super cheesy. He wanted to order the same meal again!  The ambiance of this place has a small town, hole in the wall kind of feel. It's kind of in an odd location, a True gem not too far off the strip. I can't wait to go back and explore the menu and I wish I would tried their banana cream pudding! It looked sooo good, but I was just stuffed!",

    "text": "My family and I were in town and looking for a kid-friendly place for dinner and had a bit of a hankering for BBQ. Found this place and decided to check it out after reading some Yelp reviews.   The location is off the strip and is the very definition of a dive. I mean that in the very best way.   Unfortunately, we got there right as they were getting ready to close, so we decided to get it to go and spend the night sitting in our hotel, scarfing down pounds of smokey, fatty meat with no utensils. Vegas baby.  We got the kids cheeseburgers and we ordered a combo that included pulled pork, pork ribs, chicken, brisket, hot link and choice of sides. We went with Mac n cheese and corn nuggets. Also ordered one ($10) beef rib that was enormous. Everything was really good and perfectly smoked. The chicken was a little dry, but besides that, perfection. The pulled pork was amazingly tender. The ribs pulled off the bone perfectly. I'm a big BBQ guy and this is the real deal. The beef rib was definitely the highlight. The perfect smokey, meaty bite. The corn nuggets ARE A MUST as well.  Strongly recommend.",

I adore you, Rollin Smoke Barbeque.   $49 and that was more than enough for 3 people. There was still a full box of leftovers that I lugged back to my hotel to feast on later. We got the Pit Special for $28 and a Loaded Mash for $16. The portions we got here would have easily cost over $100 back in Orange County. Brisket, pork, chicken, mashed potatoes, corn nuggets, mac n cheese, dirty/fried rice -everything was just so gosh darn tasty. Nothing was dry, overly salty, bland -everything was perfect like Chippendale guys on the billboards.  My only regret was that I didn't bring back any bbq to Orange County. Forget the blackjack table. This is where you want to spend your time and money at.",

Definitely ducked off on a side rode next to a strip club.  As you walk up your hit with all the signs letting you know its a BBQ place an when you walk in you clearly see the owner is from the razorback state Arkansas.   Now to the food. I got spare ribs, brisket, corn fritters.   The meat was tender but didn't fall off the bone. I wish they had more burst of seasons for all the meat. All our dishes tasted that they had been dipped in pepper. But no other herbs was taste.   If they didn't have there house sauces I don't think I would had finish my meal.  Now the corn fritters was to die for well o ly cause I'm from Texas an that's what we do with BBQ an fried chicken places. The batter was grand so don't change that.   I would come again to try the meatloft possible.   Hard to find good BBQ cause there's different kinds when it comes to ethics",

    "text": "Since I moved away from Texas over 10 years ago to the California, I never thought I would be able to find a decent BBQ place until I came here a couple weeks ago.  This is the by from the best BBQ, I had since I moved.  Before Las Vegas, we were in Orange County, we never found any good bbq place there.  We did find Phil's down in SD.  Rollin Smoke BBQ is better than Phil's in my opinion.  This restaurant is a hole in the wall place.  There is one line to order at the counter.  The line was out the door on a 110 degrees.  We're thinking about ordering ahead of time and going in to pick it up to eat there next time we go.  I didn't see a separate line for pick up, it seems to be only one line only because this guy in front of us had a pick up order.    Portions are huge.  I ordered the Duo Combo, Chopped Brisket and Pork with the side of mashed.  My husband got the Rib Platter Special with Mac.  Our friend got The Pit Platter 5 Meat 3 Sides.  That my friend is a lot of frickin food!!  We all didn't finish our food and ended up taking the leftover home and had it for dinner.  We did get a chance to try their sauces, our favorite is the Arkansauce.    There is an AYCE on the menu for $34.99....any day, any time.  If you're a big, huge eater, you should go for it.  It wouldn't be worth it for any of us.    Locals do get a 10% off, you only need to show them your Nevada ID.  I believe if you go on their official website, anyone can get 10% off at the moment.  =D  We can't wait to be back!",

    "text": "On my first day back in Vegas, decided to take Lyft to Rolling Smoke, the Highland Drive location, since it's literally right down the street from the strip (and the Palazzo where I always stay when in Vegas.) Quick $4 Lyft trip and we're there. Came to get some grub on one of the hottest days of the summer (It was 115 degrees out and their ice machine was broke.) I ordered a 3-meat combo plate but because they were out of spare ribs, you either had to order chicken or hot links OR be forced to pay $3 extra for pork ribs. To me, that was bush league, why should we the customer be charged extra because you ran out of spare ribs? If anything, they should have absorbed that cost due to their lack of planning. It was July 3rd, so they should have figured an influx of patrons the day before 4th of July.   At any rate, I ordered the mac and cheese with my combo and had a seat. About 5 minutes later they delivered my plate to me (pictured below.) I should have known that so quick to get my plate, it would likely not be hot and rather, the meats likely already sitting on a heating lamp. Such was the case. Neither the porn ribs nor the brisket were hot. Heck, they weren't warm, either. They were room temperature. I would have taken it back and asked for hot meats, but I was famished, as I had just flown in, and wanted to eat ASAP, so I made do with what I got.   Moving forward, I'd be leary about this place, if they keep feeding you room temperature meat in favor of moving the line and selling low quality food. Having previously been to Franklin BBQ in Austin, TX, that remains the holy grail/standard for ribs and especially brisket. This time around, Rolling Smoke BBQ didn't compare.",

We asked the lady and she seemed like she could care less. When my husband had enough and went up front to cancel the order, we found out that half of it wasent even made! Burgers sat in the window the whole time. The cook came out and tried to make it right but the cold food and missing items means I won't be going back. Everyone around me had great smelling food though....",

    "text": "Located in a really... interesting area of Las Vegas, right off the freeway, this place is a HIDDEN GEM!!!!   Parking lot is small, but a good size for the establishment. Right outside are two or three picnic tables (the kinds you'd see in the park), and on the door there is a menu for you to look at. In the room where you order there are a few more picnic tables, menu is along the back wall and the cash register is in front. The lines can get very long, but thats because a lot of people have a billion questions like WHAT DO I GET?!? WHAT'S GOOD!??!  Yes, lines are long but they get the food out pretty quickly.   Hot link is super spicy IMO. So if you like spicy, then go for it! Best bang for your buck would be any of the platters. My bf and I got the rib platter or something like that, it came with spare ribs, pork ribs and beefy ribs along with a side of your choice and a piece of bread. It was about $30, and the tray of food gets brought out to wherever you're sitting. Make sure you listen for your name. When I saw the platter I thought... meh, nothing special, presentation isn't great, just seems like a bunch of burnt meat piled on top of each other. BOY, was I wrong! Don't eat the beefy ribs FIRST because they are SOOOOO good. Everything just falls right off the bone. Save that for last! The spare ribs and pork ribs aren't bad either but, seriously if you had to pick just ONE thing off the menu, go for the beefy ribs.   Add some Alabama (?) sauce to that and it'll be like a party in your mouth. Also, I'm not a huge fan of banana pudding but the one here is delicious.",

Very friendly staff that was quick to point us in the right direction for recommendations. They even have a cool fish tank created out of their original smoker...now that's dedication to their craft!",

    "text": "I just ate some of the best barbeque in Las Vegas or anywhere else.  I had the 2-meat platter with an extra side: I picked pulled brisket, spare ribs, mac n' cheese, and loaded mashed potatoes.  Everything was AMAZING.  The brisket was rich, tasty and melt-in-my-mouth, with some interesting hints of sweetness in there: I did add some Arkansauce, which added punch to the flavor.  The ribs (there were supposed to be 2, but there were 3; maybe because I was a first-timer; recommended by the countergirl) needed nothing.  Best ribs I've had, anywhere.  Charred a bit on the outside (with the smoky-salty rub cooked right into the surface of the meat), tender on the inside, came off the bones with little effort.  Loaded mashed potatoes had good flavor to start with; bacon and green onions just added to the richness.  Mac n' cheese was richly cheesy.  Better than the food was the attention (I came in between lunch and dinner rushes, so 3 other diners and me had the place to ourselves).  I got visited during my meal by the countergirl, the dining room attendant, the manager, and the chef/smokemaster-in-chief.  I didn't have much to say to them, except that I was beyond words at how GOOD everything was.  The boss man was so happy to hear that, that he had a small dessert sent out for me - so I can also tell you that the blueberry cobbler a la mode (he asked what I'd like, and I asked the dining room attendant to surprise me; great choice, dude!) is also fantastic - sweet and just enough tart and tangy.  This was my belated birthday treat to myself, so that was a perfect ending!  The dining room is simple - benches and trestle tables - cheerful and fastidiously clean.  A great oasis from a rare rainy Vegas day.  Do note: Vegas locals get 10% off our bills when we show locals' ID.  This is real, local, down-home barbeque at its best.  The friendliness, flavor and authenticity can't be beat by any of the chains.  If you haven't had Rollin Smoke yet, you haven't experienced the rich, off-Strip local foodie scene in Las Vegas.",

We ate inside (MISTAKE) and ended up smelling like smoke so bad that we had to shower and wash our hair TWICE to get the smell out.  The owner was incredibly kind and he alone deserves 4 stars but this review is based on the food.   The meat wasn't as tender as I prefer my ribs and the sides were bland. I wouldn't go back and probably wouldn't recommend it either.  The restaurant is very dim so it was hard to see our food but the taste is what's more important.  Overall, I've had much better.",

Rollinsmoke, was the best BBQ ribs my gang and I have had outside of Hawaii.  From the generous portions to the fall off the bone, meaty beef ribs...It was ONO(Hawaiian for DELICIOUS).  Anyplace with an AYCE option always attracts Hawaii Folk...But, lemme tell you that with the generous portions;I could hardly get past the first plate.  However, there's always room for dessert!  The cobbler with ice cream did not disappoint!  YUMMY!  Looking for Rollinsmoke was a lil challenge from the highway...blink and you may miss it.  Small on outside;big on inside...With seating inside and out;there was plenty of room to accommodate my group of twelve and then some.  Our group also included 4 kids(they have a kid's menu)this place is very family friendly.  In or going to Vegas? Check this place out!  I know my friends and I will!  Until next time, Aloha and Mahalo",

The loaded mash potatoes and green beans were great as sides but the yams were too sweet for my taste. I was impressed by the service too. While we were eating a gentleman sitting nearby complained about his bread. The manager (maybe owner?) personally came out to apologize and make things right.

I did the two meat meal for $10.99. I got two short ribs and two strips of brisket on top of a soggy piece of white bread and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the short ribs were very good and would recommend those. The brisket was good and the macaroni and cheese was forgettable. My wife got the $7.99 brisket sandwich and thought it was pretty good.  Because we checked in via Yelp, we got a \"free dessert.\" We ordered the Blue Bell Ice Cream Sundae. What they brought us was a shot glass sized plastic cup filled 2/3 with ice cream and 1/3 with whipped cream. If that dessert really costs 3.99, it is a complete rip off. It's more likely that they only gave us a sample size dessert as the \"free dessert\" that was advertised. Don't they know better than to cut corners with people who use Yelp? Whatever the case, I was less than impressed by that.   Overall, I might stop back by here to give it another shot if I was in town for a bit and looking for a meal under $15 a plate (although they have many options that would put you over that limit, including an all you can eat thing for $25). But with so many other places to eat in Vegas, it's more likely I'll try somewhere else.",

    "text": "I lived in the South for about 10 years or so and while I was there, I got real taste for good barbecue, so when I heard about this place, I was excited to try it. It did not live up to my expectations.  I had the two meat plate with pulled pork and 1/4 chicken, with a side of mac 'n' cheese. This comes with their house sauce, which seems to be some sort of Arkansas-style sauce. I didn't care for the sauce and while it didn't affect my rating, my decision to avoid the sauce did.  So here's the problem:  even without the sauce, I should have been able to tell that the meat had been smoked. The pork tasted like...pork. Not smoked pork. Just pork. The same with the chicken. I could have gone to the grocery store and picked up a whole rotisserie chicken and it would have tasted exactly the same.  According to the web site, they use rubs on their meat. I did not see or taste any evidence of this. Both the pork and the chicken were bland. I can't say either meat tasted bad, but I also can't say either meat tasted like they'd been barbecued.  One other thing -- the service was a lot slower than I would expect for meat that's supposedly been cooked already. I took 20 minutes for me to get my food. I've never had barbecue take that long.  I don't think I'll be going back.",

    "text": "BBQ nirvana!  First time there.  We are always on the hunt for good 'que.  This is the best in the valley. Eat in at the picnic tables or take out.  Unknown if beer is available.  Spotless clean.  Order at the counter and the staff will bring out your food quickly.   Lots of sauces to samp!e on you r meat. Hubby ordered 1/2 rack beef ribs (2) that must of had 1/3 lb of meat each.  Tender and smoky.   I had chicken that was so juicy and tender.  Love soul food so I ordered collard greens plus mac  and cheese.  Their greens were the best I've ever had and the mac a close second. Also ordered beans that hubby was trying to slow down as delicious.  Not sweet.  Beans with a little cayenne kick.   Since we were doing take out, we got corn nuggets for the road.   Creamed corn in a light batter that is deep fried.  The nuggets were gone and enjoyed by the time we got home.  Definitely enough to share. Use your GPS to get there and on your way back.  In a small strip mall under an overpass near the strip. Wow wow wow.  Going to get my Rollin Smoke BBQ again and again",

This joint is a straight hole in the wall with lots of people waiting in line to get them some BBQ. Friends and I ( party of 3 ) ended up deciding that the $50 party platter ( feeds 4-5 people ) would be the best choice for our hungry selves . HANDS DOWN!! The best bbq I've ever bought from a restaurant . Meats were succulent , the sauces were everything . Portions on point! The employees were super nice and down to earth as well. Will totally come back here when I'm in Vegas!",

We chose the bbq baked beans which was really good and I don't even care for beans.  The plate comes with chopped brisket soooo good put a little of the carolina sauce on it and you'll stuff yourself because you can't stop eating it.     The sliced brisket had a nIce little smoke on it with enough fat on it so it's tender, I mean practically fork cutting tender.    But the star is the burnt ends!!!!  Seriously melt in your mouth and the  sauce is just clinging to each of the moist, flavorful morsel of meat.  It is by far the best burnt ends ever conceived.     The other sides we bought were the corn tots, I can't remember what their actually called but they are good. It's creamed corn that's deep fried .    The other side was the collard greens. Perfectly cooked. Delicious!!    One more time,  get the burnt ends!!!!!",

    "text": "It seems like every person in my office had been here and was in love so I knew I had to give it a try. So when we had to choose a place for an in office lunch there was zero disagreement that we had to order from Rollin Smoke. The location is a bit of a hike from my home in Henderson, but not too far from work (lucky me!).   We've now ordered twice since it was such a hit the first time. We ordered the Super Sampler which was definitely the right amount of meat for 8-10 people. It looks like a lot of food, but nobody will be able to resist seconds. Six pints of sides will not go far if choosing six different sides. I would suggest choosing three different items instead of six to make sure there is enough to go around.  The MEAT. You come here for the meat because it is the best BBQ meat you'll have the pleasure of putting in your mouth. All of the meats are obviously smoked and they do it to perfection. The flavor is really sealed into the meats. The ribs fall off the bone, chicken and pork are tender, and the sausage packs a nice heat.  I have enjoyed almost all of the sides as well. My favorites have been the Collard Greens (with brisket of course), Macaroni and Cheese, and Baked Beans. The only side that wasn't awesome was the Loaded Mash. Maybe my taste buds were off this day, but it tasted instant.   If you haven't been here then you are missing out on great BBQ.",

I ordered online too and they forgot to make the green beans...i had to wait 10 minutes more for it. The cashier had to remiind the guy in the back twice before putting in a batch.

    "text": "As I write this I am about 60 minutes removed from the table and I am uncomfortably full yet wholly content. I was told about Rollin' Smoke Barbeque about a week ago and I have been wanting to try it since.  I can check that off the list now.  I went with a co-worker, the very same man who told me about it in the first place.  Immediately upon my exit of the car in the tiny parking lot I noticed the smell of BBQ smoke.  It was only enhanced as I entered the establishment.  Aside from the delicious smell of BBQ, which has permeated every fiber of my clothing and still lingers, I was greeted by a huge version of their menu posted to the wall.  I opted for the smaller hand held version though.  It was easier to read.  After looking at said menu for a few minutes I decided on the brisket dog.  I also ordered a side of corn nuggets based on reccomendations from my dining acquaitance of the day.  The hot dog was immense to the point where I gave up eating it with my hands and went with the fork and knife method.  It was a heavy gauge dog with a fantastic red color and the nice snap of a natural casing.  But it was difficult to actually see that beneath the truck load of fried onions, chopped brisket and nacho cheese.  What a gut buster this behemoth is.  Then there are the corn nuggets.  Little bite sized fried pieces of corny goodness.  It is best described as fried creamed corn.  It is crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with the sweetness I have grown to love.  Frying it just adds to the alure.  After eating the dog and these corn nuggets along with drinking a cup of lemonade, I am stuffed.",

Desert Inn Road and look for the big BBQ sign on the store front.  Make your order, find a table, make your drinks, and wait about 10-15 minutes.  They'll bring your order to you with a smile.  My first visit, I went for the 3 meat choice (brisket, chicken, and hot links).  The brisket, soft.  The chicken, most and tender.  The hot links, full of taste packing sneaky heat.  As the saying goes, \"broke da mouth\".",

This place blows phils out of the water, they use a rub on the ribs and a little bit of BBQ sauce you can add more to your liking. I usually prefer a moloasses based bbq sauce with little to no vinegar flavor. There sauce was a great combo of both and add it to the rub on the meat its like a match made in hell at high heat cooked to perfection.   I was in vegas with my father so we split a half rack of ribs and the meatloaf which is a looks like meatloaf but thats about it because they fill it with pork and different bbq favorites that take it to the next level.   Great spot off the strip, went on a weeknight no lines, parked in front, great food and experience. BTW if you have had Phils BBQ in San diego this blows it away.",

Only down side was not enough to be off putting, but again with the darn green onion garnish on top of all the food!    I can't even with this banana pudding too!  Probably the absolute best I've ever had!  It's almost like a frosting consistency but not overly sweet or banana flavored in any way. Incredible!

Well hell, I ain't ashamed to say it - I love me some barbeque!    Yeehaw!  I spent a good bit a time in Texas, so it ain't no surprise Texas barbeque ranks up there on my list of the some of the best eats this here world's got to offer - brisket, ribs, sausage and of course, smoke. There's this little barbeque shack in Austin that smokes its brisket for 16 hours, can you believe that - 16 hours? It comes out crispy and as black as coal on the outside but just as juicy as all get out on the in, with the prettiest pink smoke ring, it just about makes you wanna cry. Why, I spect it's about as close to heaven as one could ask for. The fella who runs this place is a real arteest - leavin' just the perfect amount a fat to make that brisket as moist as a Guadalupe mud pie. Anyway, when I thinks of barbeque, well, that's what comes to mind.  So it ain't no surprise to the folks that knows me that Rolling Smoke Barbeque just doesn't cut the brisket - or rather, it cuts too much of the brisket. Where's my crispy, burnt, smoky edge, where's my juicy, tender beef, and where's my smoke ring - what the hell did you do with my smoke ring? Boy, angels is weeping in Amarillo.  Now don't get me started on them there sausages - they's got so much flavor, why did you have to go and overcook it like that? I mean this stuff was drier than a West Texas desert. It's a good thing them corn fritters was damn tasty (course, I'd had better) or I'da went to bed hungry that night.  Okay, I'll admit it, for Vegas this shit ain't bad - hell it just might be the best barbeque joint in town, but that's no damn excuse.   For pete's sake stop cutting off the good stuff  for dem sissy-pant  intellectual types from Henderson. They's so terrified of this part of town anyway, they drive in and out of here so fast you'd think their asses was on fire.   This is barbeque dammit! People's food. We knows its got fat, we knows its got calories, we knows it ain't healty, but that's the way we likes it - if we's wanted healthy we'd go to Henderson. Besides, it'a give us a chance to put a scare in dem locals up there.  Shit gets a 3 cause this is Vegas, but don't go thinkin I'm all happy or anythin'. Ya'll make me miss Texas.",

It was a saturday noon when we arrived. We were in line waiting to order when suddenly people started coming in in groups. Suddenly they were busy... Oh coz it's lunch time. Wow! I guess they really are popular. Since it was our first time we ordered the 3 meat meal with macncheese and extra order of mashed potatoes. I can't remember how much we paid but it sure was very much affordable than what we would usually pay at  Lucille's for the amount of food we got.  I wasnt able to take pictures as we were starving and we just ate soon as our food arrived. What we ordered again was a 3 meat meal with mcncheese and extra side of mashed potatoes and drinks. The meat meal also came with a roll. The serving was enough to feed 2 adults a preteen and a toddler. They were yummy!!!! Very flavorful. Serving was ample to actually alot (atleast for us).  Staff were excellent. The lady who took my order was very helpful. She gave suggestions and didn't quite rushed me despite the line behind me.   We liked this place so much that i recommended it the same week when my workplace offered to treat the employees for lunch.  Too bad this place is far from our place. But we'll surely eat or take out again when we are in the area.",

    "text": "Man...thank you Nelson Q for checking in! I came right after he left! We had the Pulled Piggy sandwich for $7.99 and the Trio Choice Plate which gives you a choice of 3 meats. We got the brisket, pork, and 2 spare ribs for $13.99. Oh it was divine! The meat on the spare ribs just slips right off of the bone, and the pulled pork was just juicy and full of that smokey flavor.  The owner conversed with us for a bit, and based on his choice of decor in the place, you can tell hes an Arkansas fan. He was super humble and couldn't stop being grateful for all the Yelpers who had Yelped about this place. He also helped us with making choices. With a party of two he suggested the trio plate and the pulled pork sandwich if we wanted to have variety since the plates were more than enough to share. We chose beans and mac and cheese as our sides, and I tell you it was also just as good and homemade tasting as the meats! He also told us a little bit about the process in which they smoke the meats in their smoker right behind the restaurant, and smokes it for 16 hours (no wonder it's so good!). He wanted give Las Vegas a taste of good old Arkansas bbq, and he sure did!  When you check in you get a free pie with your meal! I got the sweet potato, ala mode of course! Super delish, and a must try. I will see you soon. Hands down one of my favorite places to eat.",

    "text": "Good smokey bbq with some very nice owners Typically going to Vegas it's the same restaurants or small food/snack shops that keeps the stomach satisfied, but on the last trip a couple friends decided to come here for a birthday dinner. Upon reaching the premises my nose was hit with the mouth watering smell of bbq. Our party of 18 or so people were given a spot at an empty room and were greeted with great enthusiasm and hospitality. My gf and I were probably the 4th to put in the order of the Outlaw burger and the Rib Plater special. After waiting in the room slowly everyone started to get their food and were enjoying the dinner while we waited. After coming in to check on us (forgot the gentlemen's name) he explained the food was forgotten or being remade, which I can't remember, but long story short they got us the food and also gave us a free A LA MODE Black berry cobbler.  Rating of the burger and ribs  -Jaw dropping sized burger filled with such tasty bbq flavor that's complimented with the onion strings (DROOOL) -Very flavorful sauce (More on the tangy side) on the ribs and the meat slides right off -The cobbler is something that needs to be ordered either by you or someone in your party. I was so full after the burger and a few ribs but was able to have a bite off the cobbler and it was amazing. Full of flavor and just takes over all that meat/bbq flavor in your mouth.",

If you take the taxi, make sure you have the taxi's company number or your hotel's front desk so they can call a taxi for you on the way back. Or you can try to walk to Trump hotel and get a taxi.   It is a MUST you try their meatloaf and brisket. We eat a lot of BBQ joints and this place is hands down have the BEST brisket and cornbread. Trust me.

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times and the food is usually on point.   Hot links are juicy with the right amount of heat (I like spicy food)  Brisket is pretty good although the their burnt ends are actually burnt ends.  Burgers are pretty good value and most of their sides have good flavor (try the corn nuggets or loaded potatoes)  The real problem is that their service is pretty bad. I've spent over 20 minutes waiting while my friends got their food in 5 minutes. I asked them to check on the food and they said \"I'm sure it's coming\" and shoved my check back in my face.   Their new reusable cups are a plus for repeat visitors, $1.00 off for refills. There is also a locals discount as well as coupons on their website.  Good for food. Bad for service. Come hungry. Leave spending a little more than you wanted to.",

If this is the best BBQ in Vegas then I guess it's time to head to Kansas City or Austin.",

Also got the two meat platter of brisket and ribs with a side of Mac.   The Mac was very very good and cheesy. It tasted different than any other Mac I've had. It's not too thick or thin and the flavors melt together nicely with the tastebuds.   The sliced brisket was cooked low and slow and tasted tender and had good flavor. The brisket was a bit on the fatty side, more than usual.   The short ribs were smoked very well and weren't too fatty.   The downfall is the $3 drink. That's very high especially for the size cup.   Worth a stop  and seems like the place to be with the line nearly out the door.",

    "text": "Rollin Smoke Barbeque never disappointed me! It's definitely one of my favorite bbq place. Me and my family comes here every time we have a craving for bbq. It's comfort food!  This is not a big, fancy Vegas style restaurant. It's actually kind of hidden in the intersection of DI and Highland. You can definitely find it by the piggy, bbq painting on their walls and doors.  Their menu is huge, a variety of bbq meats (pork, beef or chicken) fish, shrimp and the sides.  My usual favorite is the Pulled Piggy Sandwich ($9.99) plus $4 for one side and a drink. The meat is so flavorful, delicious and tender.  I order this a lot! We also very often have the The Pit Special 5 meats and 3 sides for $27.99. It consists Brisket, Pulled Pork, 1/4 Chicken, 2 Spear Ribs, Hot Links. No substitution! This meal is so big! It's good for sharing, or if you are starving, maybe you can finish it! LOL I can't for sure! By the way, any or all substitution subject to an upcharge!  We never had, but they are offering All You Can Eat for $34.99. Anything on the menu. Any day, any time! No sharing and no Togo's!   They also have Salads, Wraps and Spuds.  Also Kids Menu is $9.99, includes one side and a drink. Lil' Bitty Piggy's Menu for ages 10 and under.  Did you know that all smoked meats and sauces are gluten free? Yes! And they are delicious!",

All sides were excellent (sweet cornbread; kick'n bbq beans with meat; and collard greens cooked in brisket juices). Sauces were okay - nothing transcendent, but good variety of bbq toppings to try, including a North Carolina vinegar. Meats were so good (except for the unfortunate desiccated low-quality steroid-laden chicken) that you could eat eat them without sauce - they even tasted great cold, the next day. All of them were excellent - pulled pork, pork ribs (delightful, and next time I'll pay the $6 to try their beef), brisket, and hot links. So, so good.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.   I was lucky to get invited to a neighbor's catered event today. I saw the catering truck in front, and they kept hauling out more and more food (it looked like a pretty big event). It smelled so amazing outside.   The setup was nice, several long tables, all covered with a red/white tablecloth (which gave a family picnic feel). The catering event was organized very well- everything needed were set up on those tables. Plates and cutlery packets were on the left side. Napkin holders were in several spots.    The two employees were very nice. They served the food on my plate. They seemed to enjoy their job, as they were smiling, the conversation was good, and kindly asking what I wanted. The food: Coleslaw, Mac & Cheese, Ribs (they were huge!), Brisket, Chicken (choice of white or dark), and Cornbread. The fixings (sliced pickles, green onions) were in the middle of the food and the sauces (on the far right) (-there were about five or six of the sauces), butter, extra seasoning, and wet naps, alongside the sweet tea and ice (and logo water bottles- save the label, has a 10% off coupon on it).    I really liked the flavor of the brisket, which was lean, but not dry (no gross fatty pieces) and the chicken thigh (very tender) as well as the coleslaw and mac & cheese (creamy). I didn't get the cornbread until I made some room on my plate as I was headed out (I was expecting a visitor) so I thanked the host again before leaving (I didn't completely eat & run).   I'm so glad that I got to try it, and it makes me curious to visit the one near my place (and it's funny, because we were just talking about trying it, too). I was able to get a menu and sticker to go, too.",

I was planning another Vegas trip for the weekend and googled bbq places close to where I was staying. The rolling smoke Barbeque had soo many good reviews  I had to go check it out. Once I arrived inside I knew it was the real deal. My girlfriend and I ordered a bunch of different items on the menu. The only negative part of my experience is that I didn't order food to go. Keep up the good work guys, I'll be back for sure!",

The meat is juicy, tender and just falls off the bones. Each order is huge! My kid's favorite item is the corn nuggets. But I love the ribs. They also have a AYCE option which is an amazing deal because you can pick anything off their menu for that one price.",

But, of course, let's talk about the food. We ordered the Pit Special because the staff said it would be enough for two. There was way more than enough for two to share! We could feed another person or two with this meal. The Pit Special came with 5 different meats and 3 sides. Meats included ribs, hot links, sliced brisket, chicken, and pulled pork. For our sides we chose the green beans, loaded mashed potatoes, and corn nuggets. The meats were all so flavorful, tender, and juicy. The ribs just fell right off the bone as soon as we sunk our teeth into it. You could see that pink smoke ring on the brisket, and even on the chicken, so you know they smoked it just right. The sides were all done well and paired well with each of the meats. The green beans, which were actually haricot verts, were tender but still crisp. The mashed had big pieces of crispy bacon mixed in. The corn nuggets were my favorite, though. They're small nuggets of sweet, creamed corn coated in a batter, or maybe cornmeal, and deep fried to a golden brown. A must try!  To top off a great dinner, the owner/manager came in and asked every table how their dinner was. Amazing customer service! I'm really impressed with this place and can't wait to go back for more.",

    "text": "Saw this place on the Travel Channel and was excited to remember that they're located here in Vegas. I had to come and try this place out before we return home to Hawaii. My youngest son ordered the cheeseburger with waffle fries, my oldest ordered the 1/2 rack St. Louis spare ribs with fried creamed corn balls. I ordered the Brisket 3-way (shredded, sliced, and burnt ends) with mac-n-cheese. I substituted the shredded brisket for more burnt ends for an additional $3. The spare ribs was very flavorful, but wasn't fall-off-the-bone tender. My burnt ends was amaaazing. The brisket slices had some flavor, but tasted bland towards the middle, but the various sauces they had made everything taste waaay better. Not sure how much Southern food goes nowadays, but to me it's a bit pricey. Once in a while, it's totally worth it. Now, I can cross this place off my bucket list.  The parking lot is a decent size and they have a lot of tables and chairs to eat at. You order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. All the staff were friendly and helpful.",

The Outlaw Burger- AMAZING Flavor in that patty! Even the fried onions stacked on top of the burger  were delicious, you can tell they put their heart and soul into the recipe of that batter they fry the onions in. I also enjoyed the sliced pickles that came with the burger and the pepper on top!   Brisket Salad- Delicious. Meat was great, Chipotle sauce was outstanding, tomatoes were fresh.  Collard Greens- The best I have ever had, packed with great flavor. You could drink the liquid as a soup it's so good.  Mac N' Cheese- Not bad needs a little bit of work.  BBQ sauces- weakest thing there shockingly.   Ambiance- Very cute I loved it.  I even loved the drink cups they give, they are re-usable and make for a good souvenir from your experience! I also really like their logo!   I give this establishment 4.5 stars out of 5. And I rarely give anything 4.5 or 5 stars!",

    "text": "Each time I visit Vegas, I always strive to check out new places to eat. This time I chose this BBQ joint for my pre-birthday dinner. 5 adults and two babies. We went on a Monday maybe an hour and a half or so before closing.   The place definitely looks a bit dumpy from the outside but as soon as you pull into the parking lot, you can smell that sweet smell of meat.   I was going to order the package deal for either $50 or $80 bucks but decided to do a la carte instead since none of us wanted to have hot links. Boy, the damage was quite a chunk of change but the food was delicious.  There is seating on the outside, inside where you order and pay, and there is an additional room to your right hand side when you exit the main entrance. I don't know if we were just lucky or what but we seriously got the entire back room to ourselves. It was awesome. Picnic style benches definitely made it an authentic country style bbq feel. There is a drink station in the cashier's area and the back room where we were at. They have the sauces, to go containers and bags all out for your to bag your left overs.  brisket: delicious, tender and seasoned just right. There was pepper speckles on the edges which gave it a nice taste. There was a thin strip of fat but when it is hot, it melts in your mouth. I tried one after it had cooled and it definitely did not taste as good.  beef ribs: super pricey. I had asked how many ribs a half rack came with and the lady said two. I thought I heard wrong but I ordered a whole rack anyways. When I got it, it was seriously just 4 ribs but they were huge. Melt in your mouth heaven for sure and definitely worth it.  pulled pork: this was probably the only item I did not care for. It was not that well flavored and even with the sauce, it was bleh. Next time I will not order this.  burnt tips: everyone was raving about these burnt tips on yelp so I had to get some. It was good. Nice and saucy but not a crazed fan.  corn nuggets: yummy. nicely fried and sweet.  waffle fries: like your normal waffle fries with a hint of dusted sugar. yumm  bacon potato salad: this was also an item I saw a lot of people raved about but honestly, I thought it was just alright. Didn't taste amazingly good and did not taste bad. I would prefer regular potato salad.  The food came out fast and we definitely had leftovers for two more days so it made it worth while. The establishment is kept clean and friendly service staff.  Next time, I would definitely skip the pulled pork, burnt tips and bacon potato salad. Good to try it at least once but I will definitely be going for the main food items like brisket and beef ribs :)  I would definitely recommend this to any meat eater/bbq fan. As my husband said, this is a Vegetarian/Veagan person's version of hell. Meat, meat and more meat!",

The hush puppies were excellent and full of onion.  The loaded mash was the best potato side I've ever eaten.  It was so good I refused to share with my companion!  It's a taste I'm trying to replicate at home but have been unsuccessful in doing so!  The drinks here are self-serve and might seem pricey, but you keep the cup and bring it back for a discount.",

For one, I couldn't remember the name. And two,  there is now a second location, located next to that popular pawn shop that has its own show. I was told that the owner of that store liked Rollin' Smoke so, much that he went in with them on a second location. So most searches yield the new location first. Of course, not knowing the name isn't helpful...  Anyhooooozen! We stopped for a drink on the way to dinner, and I just happened to ask the bartender if her heard of this BBQ place that was owned by a family from Arkansas and they made smoked meatloaf. He knew exactly what I was talking about, and gave me directions to the OG location. It was HEAVEN. the food. The location is cool, don't get me wrong. but the FOOD. Definitely satisfied the carnivore foodie in me!!",

It's ridiculously tall and has to be dismantled to attempt consuming.  It's a ton of fried onions over a giant softball size chunk of well done ground beef.  No, no, and no.  I love burgers but this is purely a novelty menu item to awe the masses.  I just gave up and left it.  The BBQ was great last time but not so much today.  Brisket came cold and not a lot of flavor.  Didn't like the way they pulverized it.  Sliced is better like Franklin BBQ.  Maybe that's the way they do it in Arkansas.  Ribs and hot links were okay, sides of potato salad, collards, and cole slaw good.  They have great homemade sauces.  Maybe the screaming kids that were as loud as a police siren the entire time may have influenced our experience today.  Oh, did mention their mom broke out loudly in song at one point?  Very odd.    That burger was still pretty stupid.",

She made some recommendations but I had told her that I was mainly there to try their mac n cheese. I'm not much of a meat eater but I love a good mac n cheese. I asked her what the corn nuggets were and she let me and my bf sample some before ordering! How awesome is that? They were yummy! Even my bf who was planning on getting pho after I got my mac n cheese fix, said he wanted to get some.   I ordered a mac n cheese and some corn nuggets. Both were delicious. The mac n cheese was really creamy and filling. The corn nuggets were crispy and sweet and complimented the mac n cheese really well.   While we were eating, I noticed that the restaurant was filling up with customers pretty quickly--all waiting in line to order. It definitely showed how popular this place is among the locals. Maybe when I'm in the meat eating mood, I'll come back to try their ribs!",

Everything we ordered was delicious. The hot link, brisket and chicken sliders were excellent. My family said the macaroni melted in their mouths and my brother plate was completely empty after taking his last bite of the shrimp po boy. Please make your way to Rolling Smoke.

We arrived sometime at night when it was pitch dark, and the place looked like it was straight out of a horror movie: It was dead quiet, and there were no lights around; the only thing to illuminate the dark night was the ominous flicker of the defective red \"Open\" sign. My mother and I were ready to bolt and drive straight back home to enjoy a dinner in safety, but my brother urged us on, so we reluctantly pushed open the door to Rollin Smoke Barbeque, and boy, did the atmosphere change!  Behind the dingy exterior waits a warm, casual, and welcoming locale that can only be described as a home away from home. The types of customers who eat here range anywhere from families with small children to single men with their buddies. The walls are painted with cheerful people, flowers, and green, and there are TVs for people to enjoy a little bit of entertainment while eating.   Our orders came out quickly and were delectable. The meat was tender, soft, and buttery smooth at the same time, and the flavor was just perfect. At the end of our dinner, the owner even came out to talk to us, asking us if it was our first time, explaining to us how he prepares the meat, and giving us some insight on the Arkansas way of barbeque-ing.  This must have been one of my most memorable restaurant visits, and I love how it ended. Definitely do not be scared off by the awkward storefront. This place is worth it.",

Not only did the food come out really fast, but the staff was as friendly as they come.   After a long internal debate, I ordered the Duo plate with Ribs and Brisket. The ribs were seasoned perfectly and fall right off the bone. There is also a healthy selection of barbecue sauces (the \"Sweet Country Girl\" mustard sauce was spot on).

    "text": "We had to he baby back ribs, very meaty and soft, not fall off the bone soft, but good. Some were burnt, hard and chewy, but most were good. The beans were a bit on the hard side ( bit under cooked? ) but still not too bad. The mashed potatoes were on the dry side. The slaw and corn bread were tasty. I have had Bbq ribs many places around the country so I may be a bit picker than others when it comes to bbq ribs. I bit of a hole in the wall place, which I like, small and clean, workers have a good attitude. Give this place a 3.5 rating overall.",

    "text": "Since this restaurant was featured on The Travel Channel as one of the best BBQ restaurants in the US, we decided to give it a try.  It was very quaint and felt like a 1940's family BBQ place.  Our order was taken by a charming young man of maybe 10-12 years old.  I ordered the BBQ meatloaf because that was the dish highlighted on The Travel Channel.  It was a very large portion and OK but I wouldn't order it again.  My wife ordered \"burnt tips\" the ends of BBQ brisket) which the owner said was very popular.  It was also OK but nothing to rave about.  My son (a sous chef at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas) ordered ribs which he liked.    A lady at the next table ordered a hamburger which came with an 8 inch stack of fried onions wedged into the bun by a long stick.  It was clever and looked pretty good and I overheard her say she really liked it.      The bill was over $75 which I felt was very high for what we ordered and for a counter-service BBQ restaurant.    We lived in the BBQ belt in NC for 30 years so we are very picky when it comes to BBQ.  Unfortunately, this place doesn't measure up.  I doubt we will be back.",

I ordered the trio plate which consisted of the brisket, pork and hot links.  Sides: Baked Beans and Mac&Cheese. The pulled pork is smoked perfectly, and goes great with the BBQ sauce.  The hot links were quite peppery and succulent. I felt that the brisket was slightly over cooked, but it was okay when i mixed it with sides.  The portion size was quite filling, and I only paid $20 so it was worth the price tag!!! The staff was friendly, courteous and overall the place has a great vibe.  I can't to wait to try other stuff on the menu like the smoked meatloaf looks incredible!",

The food is delivered to your table typically within 5-10 minutes always fresh. Drinks are self serve and they offer free refills.   If your interested in getting your food catered then this is the place. They always come through for office parties and get togethers. It's definitely one of the best BBQ places on the west coast.",

I'm a pretty harsh judge of barbecue, I have high standards. This place has actual good meats, well seasoned. It's not just sugary pulled pork like a lot of the places here.

I wouldn't come back again cause its nothing special  I mean I get it, they wanna sell stuff but while I was at the counter, the guy kept up selling & upselling. Idk.  Not a big fan.

    "text": "Here's the rundown regarding Rollin Smoke BBQ;  1.  Huge, I mean gigantic portions.  See pictures for yourself 2.  No one can compete with their prices when it comes to BBQ. 3.  Hole in the wall type restaurant, my favorite type  4.  Great service 5.  Conveniently located near my favorite type of clubs.  Joking...I think.   When I first met Heather H, the first thing that came out of her mouth wasn't \"Hi, nice to meet you\".  It was \"have you been to Rollin Smoke?, You have to go there ASAP\".  Actually, she did say \"hi\", but Rollin Smoke stuck in my head.  If you don't know Heather H, she's a well respected Yelper in the Las Vegas community.  And if Heather and her boyfriend love the food here, then it must be pretty damn good.  Read the reviews, rarely any complaints from anyone about Rollin Smoke.   When I found out that we were having dinner at Rollin Smoke one Friday evening, guess who I reached out to?  Heather H of course.  I thought it was funny that while she responded to my questions, she was also on her way to Rollin Smoke for lunch.   She's a die hard for sure.  As for her suggestions, she suggested something she never had and the rest of the menu. I guess this means a Win Win situation for me.   My Meal: Chicken and Ribs Combo:  Read this closely.  Don't look at prices because it's deceiving. The portions are huge!!! Portions are so big, that I only was able to finish half my chicken and one rib.  I loved the chicken BBQ. It's cooked perfectly, chicken still tender (not dry), and the flavors poured out of it with every bite. As for the ribs, I only had one and thought it was just okay. I hate to admit that I've had better ribs elsewhere. But for the price, it was a great deal.   Their mac and cheese is a must eat as well as their corn bread on steroids.  I finished the mac n cheese, but could only muster half my corn bread.  Both had a little kick to it.  Yes, even the corn bread had a kick to it.   Service was pretty good too.  You need to order at the counter and the food is served to you.  Like most BBQ places, the food does take a little time to cook so be patient and enjoy your company.   I ate a lot, Terri R ate a lot, and Chad S ate a lot. I guess that equals to all of us eating a lot.  $40 for 3 people to eat on a Friday night is not bad at all.  It's such a bargain here that you'll even be left with a few bills to hit the nearby clubs and make it rain.

Catfish is properly seasoned, crispy on the outside and juicy and flaky on the inside.  So we walked in on a Saturday night at around 11 or so and we were the only ones in there. So I will admit, I wasn't sure if the reviews were going to be right. I mean if this place was going to be as good as everyone said, then why isn't this place packed?  But we sat down and the guy was friendly and down home. I love a southern gentleman, they win me over every time. He told me that they were out of the beef ribs but if I wanted to wait 45 minutes that they would be ready. So I didn't want to wait 45 minutes and went with a meat platter. I got the brisket and st Louis ribs and hot links. Already told you about the brisket, the ribs I enjoyed too. They were tender and smokey and very flavorful. If I am being honest, then I would probably pass on the hot link. I think they were just bbq'ed too long for me.   So we got dessert with our yelp check in and I wasn't too sure that they would taste so good based on their appearance. We ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. I would alone come for the peach cobbler but again, if I am being honest I would pass on the banana pudding.  I love BBQ. It is just always so hard to find a good decent eats for BBQ in this town. But the quest for me has ended here. I rave about this place to everyone.   The BBQ sauce here is amazing too. Sweet and Spicy. I tried to see if they bottled it and sold it but they don't. So instead they gave me a to go container for free.  I can't wait to come back.",

I looked on Yelp and voila, there it was, Rollin Smoke Barbeque.   We came last night around 9 PM and it wasn't busy but there were people there enjoying their dinners. You order and pay at the counter/booth and they bring the food out to you. I got the beef brisket sandwich with a side of okra and my boyfriend got the trio with ribs, brisket, and pork with a side of mac and cheese. My sandwich was delicious! I ate it with a fork because it was so stuffed with meat that I knew it would spill out of the bun once I had it in my hands. The okra was good too. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about his trio of meat! He loved every bit of it.   It's a small, simple restaurant located down the street from Spearmint Rhino. The person who took our order was sooo friendly! My boyfriend was having a hard time deciding on what he wanted and the guy offered several suggestions, even stating which ones were his mother or grandmother's recipes. He even told us how he and his brother got started in the barbeque business.   I wonder if they've ever been featured on one of those travel or food network shows? Because if not then they really should be!",

Rollin Smoke Barbecue did not disappoint as we had the smoked pulled chicken with added onion strings, seasoned waffle fries (best ones I've ever had), smoked brisket, and the green beans.  You know how you visit a restaurant and sometimes you don't expect for everything you try to taste good?  Well, this was not the case here.  Every last dish surprised us and was absolutely lip smackin' good!  Whenever friends and family come to visit, this will be one of the spots we take them to for sure.  What a hidden gem!!!",

There's a little more Arkansas flavor to the bbq than a Texan is used to, but don't get it twisted. This is the best barbeque in all of Vegas.  If you're considering going, just do. You'll be glad you did. And yes. They've got sweet tea!",

    "text": "With all the great reviews I was expecting a little more.  Rolling Smoke is good bbq for Las Vegas but don't expect it to match Texas or Missouri greats in the taste department.  Their portions are big, the restaurant is cool, and the prices are fair for usual bbq, but the meats just aren't as good as they were hyped up to be.  I had the two meat platter with pork and brisket.  The brisket was fine, but I did not like the pork at all.  It was spiced rather than an authentic bbq-esque dish.  I also had the chipotle coleslaw which was just average.  The house bbq sauce was actually quite good, though.  I'm gong to need to try other bbq places in Vegas to compare, because Rolling Smoke could still be the best in the city, just don't expect the meat to compete with the well known bbq throughout the U.S..",

    "text": "\"HOW MUCH FOR JUST ONE RIB?\"  Actually if Chris Rock only ordered one beef rib here, that would be all he needs. I made the mistake of ordering a beef rib on the side because I thought the dual meat combo of beef brisket and pulled pork was not gonna be enough because I was really hungry. The beef rib itself  does not look like it came from a cow because if it did, the cow would have been as big as an elephant!  As you can tell, the beef rib stole the show. So lets break down my other choices.  First of all, those two black smokers you see outside are legit and im not talkin about Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. They use hickory wood to smoke all their meats and it aint no joke! Their smoke flavoring is just one of their key ingredients that makes their barbeque so good.   The dual meat combo of beef brisket and pulled pork smothered with their signature barbeque sauce will definitely get your salivary glands working overtime. The brisket has just the right amount of smoke flavoring and if the pulled pork was any more tender, Elvis himself wouldnt be any more proud singing \"Love Me Tender\".  As much as I would of loved to try all their barbeque being the carnivore that I am, that only warrants another trip or three to accomplish that. I would also like to mention their sides. I chose the bacon potato salad, but if you ask me, I think you cant go wrong with any of them. Just recently, they added fried okra and corn to their menu.  As for the desserts, assuming that the button on your pants has not busted off already, the peach cobbler is literally the icing on the cake not to mention the banana pudding.  Some random info: Yes they take cards. Yes they have sweet and unsweetened tea. Yes they have a decent amount of room with enough tables and chairs. Lastly but most importantly, their service is very remarkable (no surprise because they have the southern hospitality demeanor).  Oh, and one last thing. The area they are in is kind of suspect. Im not trying to scare you guys or anything, but the street they are on is dominated by strip clubs. Dont worry though, these guys are not open late so I dont see any problems, unless you are into strippers. LOL.",

    "text": "Went here yesterday on a last minute journey for some good, cheap food. We definitely found it! This place was smokin'!   The place had a large amount of people, but the wait wasn't long at all. This isn't a sit down and get served type restaurant. It's more of an order at the counter and pick where you want to sit joint; a style that is very appropriate for a BBQ place in my opinion.   We had a party of three so we got to see a decent amount of the menu. My boyfriend got the talked about Outlaw Burger and it was HUGE! Only 12 bucks for the combo, which includes a drink and a side. It comes with a ton of onion strings and an optional sauce if you want to kick up the heat.   As for myself, I got the Brisket Sandwich Combo($11). For my side, I got the corn nuggets which were absolutely delicious! I tried a sample in line and it was love at first taste. As for the sandwich, it definitely was good but could have used more sauce.   Our other party member got the sausage link combo($11) with mac and cheese. He wasnt digging the sausage sandwich but I think he wasn't in a sausage mood, unfortunately. The mac and cheese on the other hand...oh baby! So creamy and delicious. They use shells instead of elbow macoroni which definitely is a strong point for the dish.   As for the staff, very friendly and made us feel at home.  Overall, everything was amazing! My faves include: - Corn nuggets - The Outlaw Burger - Mac and Cheese   Definitely going to come back to try other items. Looking forward to the Loaded Mash especially!   Thanks for the wonderful meal!",

Located under an overpass on the backside (i.e. More seedy section) of the strip in an industrial area, only the locals know where to find it. You can smell the hickory smoke before you even park the car.  The place is small, and consists of some wooden picnic tables for dining, and a front counter with register. There is only one menu, on the wall behind the counter, so make sure to know what you want before you get to the front.   I personally suggest the brisket three ways and the chicken sliders (served on sweet Hawaiian rolls to boot). You will not be disappointed in the quality of meat, customer service, or level of smoke infused into your meal. The Arkansauce is pretty darn good too, although the meat doesn't necessarily need it. This place is awesome!  The only down side is you come out smelling like you work in a smoked meat factory, which makes for interesting conversation (including stares and people asking to smell your clothing) when you get back to the office after lunch!",

The baby backs and spare ribs are both delicious. The spicy BBQ sauce is awesome. This is my go-to spot for BBQ. I'll have to try the outlaw burger sometime, but with ribs this good how can I stop myself from ordering a big rib platter???",

I like the environment here it's very casual where you order your food grab your own drinks and just wait for your food to come out.

Wait ended up being 15-20 mins to order but once ordered 5 minutes to get our food. Got home to find the \"brisket dog\" had no brisket. Which was a real bummer especially paying $8.99 for a plain dog and $3 extra for a side. My husband had the \"big Hawg\" (huge pulled pork sandwich) huge was right but the flavor lacked without sauce. Unfortunately we didn't pack extra sauce. Aside from the messed up dog order and flavor lacking pork, the outlaw burger was amazing! Would definitely get that again.",

The sides are just okay okay, the Cole slaw was below average and the potato salad I thought was great it had BACON (nice touch), but the hubs said that was the only reason the potato salad was decent. The sauce I could do with or without.  Okay let's get to the main reason I'm posting this review, the MEAT! The meat was amazing! The flavor is spot on. I'm originally from Oklahoma and haven't been able to find BBQ that is even is the same wheel house as Oklahoman BBQ. You guys have completely nailed the BBQ. I can't even put into words just how good the meat is! So for me I will purchase the meat on its own and do my own sides. Love love love it!!!! Thanks for helping me find a great main meal! Yum!",

    "text": "*Military discount*   Went on Saturday 2-20-16 at 5pm.  This restaurant is located in the dark seedy underbelly of Desert Inn & the 15, surrounded by strip clubs and industrial yards.  We actually came here one time before but it was dark and we were scared of the area so we went somewhere else.  We're fraidy cats! I'm glad we gave it a second chance.    $18.91 got us a two meat combo and an additional side of corn nuggets.  For my two meat combo I chose chicken and pork, and chose mac & cheese for my side.  The combo comes with a drink in a cute re-usable cup.    They do have one high chair for the kiddos.  The ambiance is casual, staff is friendly, and there's more seating than you'd think from looking at the outside.  It was a little cleaner than I was expecting but not much.    The chicken was juicy, tender, smoky, and wonderful.  The pork....oh deer sweet 8 lb. 10 oz. baby jesus that pork is somethin' else.  It will melt in your mouth.  And their house bbq sauce is perfectly sweet and tangy.  The mac & cheese is made with perfectly cooked cavatappi and swimming in runny cheesy goodness.  The corn nuggets were served hot and fresh.    Next time I wanna try the catfish, collard greens, and banana pudding!!!",

Got right in and ordered. Ordered a lot so we could try everything.  The fries were just ok, nothing special.  The burnt ends were good but loaded with black pepper, was all you could taste. The chicken was really good, enjoyed it a lot.  The brisket was also very good, smoky flavor and not all dried out.  The ribs were good, smoked right and I dipped them in the sauce and yummy.  The pork was ok, not my favorite thing.  Overall it was good, but the burnt ends are my favorite and they had too much pepper, have to go back and try again, maybe the cook spilled a thing of black pepper on them?",

Friend: Dude they have over a 100 beautiful women.  Me: What? Wait BBQ??  Friend: Sends pictures of this drop dead gorgeous brunett in a red,white, and blue bikini.  Me: What? Wait BBQ?  Friend: They even have this amazing short person stripper.  Me: What? Wait BBQ?  I had to make this my first stop straight from the airport...and I am glad I did. I was lucky I hit them at an off hour as right after we ordered...the line went out the door!  The food: Lean baby back ribs that are thick, meaty, smokey, and flavorful. Brisket to die for....incredibly tender, smoke ring ladden...OMG....get a combo of the sliced and chopped.   I would also recommend the burnt ends ( this is something not a lot of places offer). Tons of crunch, tons of flavor, and little fat.  Great sausage and great smoked chicken...but I would not waist stomach capacity on those two.  They offer four great sauces: I had the momma sweet delicious...get it, it is delicious and complex. I also had the sweet country girl....both complemented the meats...and are great to drip the rolls and bread in.  Sides that were outstanding were the bacon potato salad, the jalapeno coleslaw and mac and cheese. I would pass on the cornbread (tasted very pedestrian), corn poppers ( hard as rocks if they are to go), and Yams ( too sweet and syrupy).  I was lucky enough to meet one of the owners and she was sweet as pecan pie and just  a nice person to talk to.......they care about what they serve and how they treat their customers and employees.....nice.  If you like bbq and your in veags this is the place...easy to get to from McCarran airport....and if your bored after the bbq...you can always watch a short person pole dance!!!!",

Everything was good, but we probably should've just gotten the meatloaf and skipped the burger, it was the same meat for both. The place was a bit pricey but their servings are huge, we were overstuffed and couldn't finish all 3 main entrees. I like the hole in the wall feel of it, this location is a BYOB, bring your own beer place which I thought was cool if you drank with your friends over some ribs. I definitely will come back for the ribs and meatloaf and will probably try other things, I probably won't over order next time.",

    "text": "Note: rating is relative to similar restaurants in the area, and not relative to all BBQ restaurants I've ever been to. Giving this place five stars and Salt Lick in Texas four stars does not necessarily mean I like it more than Salt Lick.   With that out of the way,  I was really surprised that BBQ this good could be found in Las Vegas. It's not just good 'cue, it's very good 'cue.   I'm not entirely sure what convinced me to try this place out. I think I was tired of the huge sprawling buffets here and I wanted something a bit more novel. This place happened to pop up as being open and serving non-brunch items. As someone who has gone to every major BBQ town in the country- Lockhart, TX, Kansas City,  Memphis, the BBQ trail through the Carolinas - I am difficult to impress. But I'm also fair, so I went in with low expectations.    I can happily say those expectations were exceeded. By a lot. No, it's not on the level of Franklin's or Gates or Sugarfire, but it stacks up really nicely against the best I've had in every non-BBQ city I've visited.    I got the three meat platter with the ribs, chopped brisket, and burnt ends. The burnt ends are as good as any I've had outside of KC. The only ding was that they were pre-glazed with their regular bbq sauce, which made them a touch sweeter than I usually prefer. But that's personal preference. You may find that a plus.  The ribs were solid, with a nice smoke ring and a little bit of fight to the bite. Unlike some hardcore fans,  I don't like too much pull to my ribs,  so be warned if that is your standard of excellence. For me, it was nice and meaty and juicy, just the way I liked it. What separates this from the very best is the lack of assertiveness of the smoke. The ribs are definitely smoked and not grilled, but for people who prefer grilled and are more used to \"BBQ\" from places like Chilis or TGIFridays, the milder smoke undertones that were less successful for me might be more successful for you. I am a lot more aggressive in my love of smoke and carmelization. But again, that kind of art is almost unheard of outside of cities that revolve around 'cue. It is more of a nitpick than a genuine bone of contention.   The brisket was the least successful,  with it being fairly ordinary. It was a good place to try out some of the sauces without fear of messing the meats up. I liked the spicy sauce the most. Hardcore 'cue folks will find the regular way too sweet, but casuals will appreciate it. I was not into the vinegar based sauce at all. It isn't similar to the Carolina vinegar sauce, which was my expectation.   In the end, the only thing left on my plate of any significance was the brisket. I really enjoyed everything else and would come back if I'm craving something a little out of the ordinary in Vegas.",

    "text": "Best BBQ in town! Located under a freeway overpass, it doesn't get more hole-in-the-wall than this. While Rollin Smoke's location may be subtle and discrete, its food is definitely not. All their smoked meats and sauces are gluten-free. The meat here is simply phenomenal. If you you're a big boy or girl that can eat, go for the AYCE for $35 - anything on the menu is fair game.   The times I've been here, I've stuck to the combos. The pit special is more than enough for two people if you like variety. I love the brisket, pulled pork, and spare ribs, but less of a fan of the chicken and hot links. Today's visit, my friend and I shared the rib platter special and were not disappointed. The baby back ribs and St. Louis spare ribs were some of the best I've had. One beef rib would've been enough to share, but we added on an extra for $6. To top it off, we added a 1/2 pound of burnt ends with a side of waffle fries and corn nuggets. I've had burnt ends before, but they were nothing like these. These burnt ends were juicy, tender, and so flavorful that they required no sauce. The corn nuggets are now my favorite side! I've also liked the mac & cheese and cornbread in the past.   Despite having over a thousand rave reviews, I like to think that this joint is still one of Vegas' best kept secrets. It reminds me of Freddy's BBQ from House of Cards - amazing ribs and food, but only if you're in the know. I still have yet to try the infamous outlaw burger, but I saw it pass by today and it had me mesmerized. Until next time my hungry friends.",

Both types of ribs and brisket was very good, tender and flavorful, but the sausage was only average.  Nice sized portions with good presentation.  And the sauce was OK.  They are 'Southern Based' BBQ, so I was worried it would be to mustardy or vinegary.   I'm more of a Kansas City or Memphis BBQ fan, but this was still good.  Mac and Cheese was slightly below average, but Potato salad was slightly above, so it evened out.  They are not the stars of the show, so I don't expect too much.    Cobbler (Peach and Blueberry) dessert was disappointing.",

I personally feel like he should just do what he wants to do, but he's the boss. He has great grub. I have now had all but one item on the menu. I can say it's all dynamite.   The meat is all tender and juicy. the sauce is light in flavor and texture. All the sides are great and fair size.

Noticed patrons in the restaraunt were upset with the long wait times, which I felt bad for as it was clear this was due to high takeout orders.   Corn nuggets were freshly fried, moist, flavorful, and well seasoned. Baby backs were dry and lacked sufficient smoke/ring. They were also warm at best. Keeping them moist and at the right temperature by the end of the day was a challenge for them as I suspect they were smoked earlier in the day.   Have eaten here before and found it excellent at times, and a near miss at others. This time was a total miss.",

    "text": "I'd say if you need a BBQ fix, this is probably your best option because not only is it affordable but it is also very close to the strip.   It's hard to come up with a comparison to this spot because it was my first time having Arkansas style BBQ. Now, if I compare it to BBQ i've had in Austin, TX (which isn't quite fair to be honest) the meat wasn't as tender and as flavorful as I had hoped. Although for being in Nevada or anywhere in the west coast region, they do a pretty good job. It'll definitely fix the BBQ craving!  Upon our arrival, LV was having a downpour so there was not many people in line to order. It was my first time here so I ended up deciding on \"The Pit Special\" that comes with 5 different meats and 3 small sides. I'm huge on beef ribs and \"The Pit Special\" unfortunately didn't come with one so I switched one of my meat choices for it (extra charge of $6). If you're like me who can't stop at a BBQ joint without ordering a beef rib, I'd say it's better if you just add a beef rib to your platter instead of substituting so that way you get to try everything. Our cashier, Sofia, wasn't the happiest of campers to be honest when it came to us ordering. Obviously as a customer, you're going to ask questions about what to order and you kind of except some sort of recommendation but this lady wasn't in the most pleasant of moods. She asked me if I would like my brisket either chopped or sliced. I asked her what the difference was and she said \"Well, one is chopped and the other is sliced.\" I was definitely taken back by her response but I was hoping she would be able to say, one had a thicker cut or if one sort of cut of meat had more fat than the other. Anyway, this lady had zero patience and I was just ready to pay and step away because i didn't want my meal ruined due to one sour apple.  The food was brought out by a young boy who prior to that was making his rotations around the tables cleaning and wiping them down for the next customers. He was very attentive and I think most of the people waiting for their orders noticed his efficiency and great attitude.   I immediately started with the cheesy mac and cheese and I think that is definitely the way to go! One bite of the mac and cheese and another into the chopped brisket!! The House Arkansauce was great on EVERYTHING!!!! I had it on the beef rib, the chicken, and the brisket!!  As far as the rest of the sides, the bacon potato salad was delicious but I'd say the yams were a little too sweet for my liking.   The meat was definitely delicious but I did notice some parts being a tiny bit dry. Maybe it was just my beef rib, but the rib had parts where it was extra tender and other parts where it was a little tough. Overall I would still recommend ordering it.",

We split the 5 meat platter to get a well rounded lay of the land. Chicken was perfectly moist and flavorful, piled pork was tender and soaked up the sauce readily. Hot link left a bit to be desired as it was tough and loaded with black pepper which overshadowed any smoke. Ribs lacked a depth of smoke I look for in top shelf specimens, but were very tender! Least impressive was the brisket which is disappointing as it was a bit greasy and the extreme chopping left the consistency a bit to be desired. The sides were fan with the best mac & cheese I've had from a restaurant. Creamy cheesy and hints of other flavors(garlicky ranch?!?) that kicked me right in the tongue. Beans are loaded with meat and a perfect spicy sweet that finished the 1-2 tongue punch combo. Ambiance is strip mall picnic, service is \"self\", and prices are in line with expectation. Don't get me wrong this food was solid 3 stars, I was just hoping for more out of the  food from a place with smoke in the name. I'll give it another shot, but at first glance this joint does. It make the list.",

I thought, \"that's quite a big claim...\" Since my boyfriend and I were Rollin Smoke virgins, we decided to go all in for our first time and ordered the pit special (5 meats + three sides) to get a taste of everything.. WOW I don't think I've really been eating BBQ all my life. My boyfriend stated that the ribs were the best he's ever had. The brisket was SO GOOD it makes me wish that cows weren't methane machines. Pulled pork came in a close third place to all the meats we tried, with the chicken last. Some parts were somewhat dry, and lacked flavor. Sides were delicious too. Sweet, soft, and moist cornbread. Corn nuggets got boring to eat after a few bites. Don't get me started on the Mac n cheese though- I'd like to buy a gallon or two for me, myself, and I and eat myself into cheesy pasta oblivion. Best macaroni and cheese I've ever had. It has been on my mind since I came here last.  I've seriously been missing out. And you are too if you haven't tried Rollin Smoke.  You're right, guy.

After a failed attempt to return to Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, where I went up each level of the Planet Hollywood parking structure without finding a single spot, (not even a False hope spot like \"Yes! Wait there's a Prius. Shit.) I decided to search Yelp for an off strip spot with top notch reviews and ample parking. That's when I stumbled across Rollin' Smoke BBQ and boy I'm glad I did. Although the hot links weren't very spicy (like I prefer) they tasted great with the \"Country Girl\" mustard based sauce. The brisket was on point and the ribs cooked to perfection as well. They have several sauce varieties, all good, especially the vinegar one (\"Alabama vinegar\" I think.) The staff was very friendly and our food came out within 10 minutes. I'll definitely be back to this place and wish them continued success.  Try it or Diet Final Word  Oh you better believe it, you need to try...this...place. Solid, solid BBQ without all the hustle and bustle of the strip or the long celebrity chef lines.",

This restaurant is hidden, located very close to a strip club, in a dark plaza, windows are tinted, and is missing a bouncer outside. However once you step in, it's like being in Texas again.  You order up at the counter and take a seat. They bring your food to you. The cashier was cool and even know how to say my name correctly. Respect given.   Like any good BBQ joint, they better give you a good bang for your buck. I expect finger licking seasoned grilled meats and a slew of sides. They sure didn't disappoint. They sure know how to rub their meats!  Brisket: Seasoned perfectly. The best brisket in Vegas Spare Ribs: Fall off the bone and flavorful Chicken: Not dry and seasoned very well Mashed potatoes: Buttered and smooth just the way I like it Yams: Sweet and juicy Corn Nuggets: Awesome deep fried corn nuggets. Never had these before  Everything pretty much was on par with great BBQ. Not Austin, TX great, but for anywhere else, it's up there. It's cheap and filling for some good rubbed meat!",

    "text": "Absolutely amazing!!  Hands down the best bbq in Vegas and the best I've had outside of Texas.  This is TRUE bbq, you can tell they don't just slather bbq sauce on the meat and call it barbecued. You can taste the smokiness in the meat and it's unbelievably tender. There were 3 of us and we got the all you can eat so we were able to try a bunch of items on the menu:  chicken, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, spare ribs, baby back ribs, beef ribs, mac n cheese, coleslaw, fried okra, banana pudding, berry cobbler, and a root beer float.  The highlights were definitely the ribs. The spare ribs and baby backs were my FAVORITE things we tried. Spare ribs had a bit more kick and spice, and the baby backs were juicier and fattier (in a delicious, perfect way). The beef rib was also delicious - not to mention the biggest rib I've ever seen - but very rich and filling. The coleslaw was excellent to cut the richness, sweetness, and smokiness of the meal, and the fried okra was simple and perfect. Mac n cheese was also great (I totally judge a bbq place on hthe quality of their mac n cheese... ie Big Ern's at Container Park sucks). Brisket wasn't thrilling, but I admit I like my brisket with a little fat on it and this was quite lean.  The prices are insanely good, cheaper than Famous Daves or Lucilles, and the food is better! We got AYCE but would've been fine sharing the Pit Special, Rib Platter, & adding a couple beef ribs - which is basically exactly what we ordered, except we paid more because we chose AYCE and they added extra to the platter, which we didn't need and had quite a bit leftover. Also the service is awesome, they genuinely care if you're enjoying the food. The entire experience was great!  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu, I have my eye on the collard greens, loaded mash potatoes, and \"bbq parfait!\"",

But then again, I rarely find myself driving on Highland Drive, which mainly seems to be a business district with strip clubs. Anyway, I'll try to keep it short and sweet.   This place is all about the sides, I absolutely love them! I secretly think they are even better than the meat, LOL! My favorites so far are:  Cheesy Mac N Cheese - very creamy cheese sauce, and they top it off with even more (shredded) cheese! Corn Bread - always hot and fresh! I love how they put a good amount of butter on them and are not dry!  Corn Nuggets - one of the employees suggested that we try this, and I'm glad we did. Creamy corn on the inside. Crispy goodness on the  outside. Great with ketchup, A MUST TRY! Kicken Beans - I don't eat beans (unless they are soybeans), but my husband and friends have said that this was delicious.   The one side I was not crazy about were the waffle fries. They were soggy and cold the one time I had ordered them.   OK, OK, the meats are pretty good too. My husband and I shared The Pit Special and I did like the brisket and pulled pork. Both were juicy, tasty, and cooked perfectly. Their barbecue sauce is good, but a bit tangy. I still say it's all about the sides! :P The employees are very friendly. They walk about asking if you enjoy the food and if you are happy. Drinks, utensils, condiments and to go containers are all self-serve.   Sometimes they can get crazy busy, where the line is out the door. You know what they say, the hole in the wall places are the best! I'm glad we found this spot, I think they have the best barbecue in town!",

I've been to Memphis, Kansas City, and Dallas and never had a lick of the stuff.  Even better, growing up in Hawaii, we boiled our ribs before grilling them.  I'm quite the expert.  But...  The wafting aroma of sweet hickory smoke.  The earthy, mild spice rub that has deeply penetrated the proteins; a moist, beefy rib with tender sinew and rendered fat;  fall off the bone baby backs; \"suckably\" delicious cartilage of toothsome spareribs, and glistening slices of brisket.  The acrid, bitterness of the smoke ring in strong contrast to the almost sweet meat.   Food porn!  The sauce has a good vinegar kick that helps to cut the one dimensional flavor and cloying, richness that becomes more difficult to take the more you eat and the colder it gets.    Their signature, bigger than any human's mouth, stuff falling out, BBQ sauce on your face \"outlaw\" burger is good eats.  Brisket, sauteed onions, peppers, fried onion strips, slaw, veg, cheese and a chipolte aioli; what's not to love?  Remaining menu items less successful.  The breaded catfish and shrimp are both overcooked and rubbery.  The smoked meatloaf, excessively smoky and bitter.  Deep fried sides often oily with one exception, the outstanding cream corn nuggets.  Crispy on the outside, rich creamy corn goodness on the inside.  Prices are very reasonable for the quantity.  The $24.99 AYCE a winner; anything on the menu, one price.  The worthy indulgence is not without cost.  Suffice it to say, remember waking up from a drunken stupor after having smoked your first cigar?  All the mouthwash in the world...",

The high points of Rolling Smoke are that the BBQ food is consistent, and the quality is good. There is plenty of seating for a group.  The reason this place should be higher rated: 1. Parking is difficult if they are busy at all. 2. They generally only have one person taking orders which result in a long line.  3. The layout makes almost no sense. You are constantly giving way to other customers. 4. There are no appropriately sized lunch portions, which means I am always wasting food and money. 5. Inconsistent service. We go for lunch and sometimes we are in and out in 30 minutes other times its 90 minutes.  6. Never dirty but never feels clean.",

There was a ton of food and not a single complaint!  Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu.",

    "text": "The Outlaw Burger is the meal cheat days were made for! It's gigantic and completely acceptable to share, weighing a monstrous amount and nearly filling an entire takeout box. Piled high with juicy, flavorful brisket (tastes like Texas!), crispy fried bell pepper and onion strings, cheddar cheese, and chipotle aioli, this thing is packed with big, bold flavors. The red cabbage slaw adds the perfect bit of crunch and acidity, bringing what could be an overwhelming mouthful flying back into foodie heaven.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to have wet dreams about this burger.  Initially we were turned away because they had \"just closed\" only for the owner to come chasing after us, insistent that we could still be served. Right after our order was placed, a family walked in and were turned away. I'm flattered and grateful that we made it in under the wire, but maybe turn off all of the neon flashy BBQ lights if you're closing so that you don't have to ruin anyone's day!  EDIT: I returned for actual barbecue and found the meat to be poor quality and the portions on the stingy side. Pricing is about on par with other spots, and their sauce is good, but either they've gone downhill or the Outlaw burger is about the best they can do.",

We live in Las Vegas and have gone to many BBQ places in town and of course I grew up in the Carolinas and lived in Texas too , so I know my BBQ ! Well , it is good but I didn't think it was great as others do . The meat is definately smokey which alot of places here don't seem to do . I got the 3 meat plate and my son got the big burger . The burger was cooked perfectly and was good , but I have to say the Famous Daves Ultimate Brisket Burger is better . Now , the ribs here are more moist and flavorful . I like the pulled pork a little better here too and I like the Southern Girl sauce better than any of the others . The BBQ beans tasted a little old and not good and I love BBQ beans ! The sausage was ok , but again Dave's beats theirs . The corn nuggets were good and I don't know anyone else around here that serves them . It would have been nice to have corn bread in my platter than the one piece of bun underneath that was oily . All in all , I think this is a good place and will probably try again and they also offer a locals discount . The lady at the counter was really friendly which I appreciate since I am also in the service industry it is nice to talk with people who aren't just doing their job and go next in line . I would recommend this place , but not my favorite , but better than a few others I have tried in town .",

It's what you would expect to find for great food.  Don't run away as you will miss a great find.  Seating is limited so don't be afraid to share a table.  There was a line when we showed up so we had to wait about 15 minutes just to order.  Another 20 minutes for the food to arrive which we thought was long but hey, we had good table conversation.  The food was great.  I had a trio combo of sliced brisket, ribs and hot link.  I really didn't need sauce on any of it as it was great but I love the way sauce tastes.  The table sauce was super but there're some other sauces near the counter that you need to get and fill a little cup.  These are worth exploring.  Although I'm sure there are better place across the nation, this is a great place to feed an angry hangover.",

If your'e visiting vegas, it's worth a short 4-5 minute drive from Fashion show mall to taste some of the best bbq i have ever had. We were staying at TI and it was right  across the freeway.   This was the first time I tried beef ribs. It was cooked to prefection. It was tender fall off the bone, and paired perfectly with the zesty bbq sauce. My friends ordered the trio bbq, the hotlink sandwich, and the brisket sandwich. No one was speaking, we were all too consumed eating the food lol. Their curly fries were crispy, mac n cheese was cheesy, and their cobbler was fantastic.  The service was excellent. Food was brought out to our table. We sat on the outside bench, which was convenient for a party of 8. They checked up on us on several occassion to make sure we were happy with the food. The Chief took his time to come out to ask how we like the food. My boyfirend is a bbq fanatic, he had to go shake the hand of the man who made these fantatic food.   They have made  a fan of me. I will definitely go back.",

Yet I guarantee once you've discovered this place off the map that the tourists have you'll never forget where it is.  People have meals they remember.  People have meal they never forget.  But very rarely do people have meals they have to ask themselves if it really happened.  No food should be allowed to taste this good.  They really shouldn't.  Because all it does is make all the other bbq feel bad, feel ashamed for their inferiority and their audacity to put themselves into the same class of eats as Rollin Smoke.    Everything here is excellent--from their ribs to their sides, from the service to their decor.  It's like walking into everybody's idea of the perfect bbq joint and finding out you never have to leave... and that maybe you never should lest it vanish like the magical culinary paradise it really is.",

The short ribs were on the tough side, but not inedible. The Arkansauce was too vinegary and watery. The spicy sauce had no other flavor besides the pepper that was used to make it spicy. It didn't taste like bbq sauce, only like hot sauce. I don't think I'll come here again. Although I have to note that the employees were friendly and very proactive at keeping the place clean.",

    "text": "I had to go there after all the talk on here.  The location is in a umm kinda shady part of town but I went there for the BBQ.  Its a True  BBQ joint. Plastic forks and knives, Styrofoam and paper plates.  The smell of smoke was pretty amazing. I was floating in like this place was the pied piper.  The menu is pretty simple like it should be.   The owner was taking the food order. Its kind of different. You pay first and wait for a runner to bring out your food. The owners are very nice people and really care about their food.  I ordered The Biggin, its a sandwich with pork, brisket, and hot links and it was friggin delicious. There's no easy way to eat this monster. You have to dig in and understand things are gonna get messy.  One boy ordered the catfish po boy. Yes its not BBQ but he loved it and they did make it perfect.  Another ordered the Brisket Dog. I didn't know it was on a sesame seed bun which he was allergic to. They made it over at no charge and put it on a hamburger bun. The sandwich was as big as his head! I was entertained just watching him trying to eat this behemoth! Its a good thing they have rolls of paper towels on the tables because this kid needed a whole roll. He loved it too.   I will definitely be back again!  oh and guys, if you sneak there without your wife or GF, you will be caught because you walk out of this place smelling like smoke!",

The flavor was different.  It has a tang to it. The Kicken beans also had a unique taste which was heavy on the bell pepper.   The mac n' cheese had an extremely liquid cheese sauce. My cousin enjoyed it. Me, well, it was acceptable. I prefer more of a casserole consistency in mac n' cheese.  Ribs and brisket were tender. Hot link was dry and over cooked.

We ordered a 1.5 racks of ribs, 1 lb. beef brisket, 3 sides of BBQ sauce, sweet potatoes, & beans.   It got busy quick with all the customers lining up, made me glad I had called in our order early.  Our order wasn't quite ready when we arrived at 12pm as they were still packing the food to go, but the guy at the counter was very nice and offered us drinks while we waited!  We were in & out in about 10-15 minutes after I paid, had a drink of sweet tea, and received our order .  It smelt so good during the car ride home, we tried the food right away.  Ribs fell off the bone, beef was tender, and the sides were all super delicious.  We were very pleased with the smoky flavored barbecue goodness which easily fed a family of 6.  Just awesome food, we'll definitely be back for more!",

Come in with an appetite for this one and has a side of Mac and cheese... So cheesy and saucy. Now that's what I call Mac and cheese!! I wish I ordered just that because that's how fucking good it was. The Spudtastic lived up to its expectations from Yelp reviews. It's like a baked potato on steroids. DELICIOUS.

When you see it you'll understand. The food was delicious and I will be back! I had catfish with greens and hushpuppies. An employee came and asked how I liked it. They checked on us a few times.

I had the corn nuggets which were great and the club sandwich which was comprised of many different kinds of meat- perfect for me as I was trying to decide which one I wanted.  The sandwich was pretty good, the bacon in the sandwich made it awesome.    The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I rarely have bbq here in Vegas, and I have no idea if it is the best.  It was a little pricey and the wait was a little long. The food was good though, and some day I'll be back.",

My boyfriend and I went in to visit this place with high expectations and it did not disappoint. Cashier girl Lizelle was super sweet and a delight to order from! We ordered the 3 rib platter and the pulled pork sandwich. They have variety of sauces to pick from and really cool cups for your soda.  Chef Will brought out our food for us and it was like heaven! I personally just started eating meat again but the ribs were like nothing I ever had before. My boyfriend being a huge carnivore even agreed!   As we were almost finished eating (not even able to finish half way because it's super filling and huge portions) Chef Will came out to let us try some burnt ends with his special hot sauce! The hot sauce isn't on the counter and he has it in the back. We were so delighted at how sweet and generous he was! Being a flight attendant and food enthusiast I've ate at so many food places but this place is by far one of my favorite places to eat.   It's a must try if your in the area and even if your not I would make the drive here because this place is special. We will definitely be making our way back as much as we can!   Ps. Also this place is has been on TV, magazines and winning multiple awards. Now you have to go try it !!",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of BBQ. Real BBQ, not the garbage you get from chain restaurants.  When my wife asked co workers who have been long time Vegas residents where to get the good BBQ, this was the place frequently mentioned.  Recently we tried this place out, and my brother and nephew went as well.  Everyone was very full and very satisfied when we left.  To find this place is by word of mouth, or you'll have to google it, because it sits a bit behind the Vegas strip in a more industrial area and chances are you would not happen upon it by mistake.  As soon as you drive up, you get that smell. That smoked BBQ smell that makes your mouth instantly water.    The prices are a little up, but worth it for the food that you get. I personally ordered the three meat plate, which I chose to be the ribs, the pulled pork and the sausage.  My wife got the burnt ends for her meat.  All of it was crazy good.  Large portions, juicy meat and just totally full of flavor.  Be warned that while their food is not crazy spicy hot, there is a little kick to it.  The only thing I didn't find worth it was the side orders, I paid like four bucks for a side of coleslaw that was not life changing.   My nephew for the Outlaw Burger, which I'll load a picture off. This thing is every bit as big as it looks in the picture, and the hardest time he had was trying to figure out how to eat it.  He said he loved every bite of it, and has talked about coming back to Vegas from Cali to have another one.    Overall this is some of the best BBQ I've ever had and I liked the squeeze bottles of lots of different flavors of sauces they have all over. If you're in town, you gotta check this place out.",

    "text": "I love when Yelp steers me in the right direction. I am not a BBQ connoisseur or really even a BBQ fan, but I had family in town and we wanted to try some place new.   It was a little difficult to find, but I had driven by Rollin Smoke while I was in the area on a previous occasion so knew generally where it was located. We had initially attempted to go to Peppermill, but the wait was longer than we were willing to eat, so I made the executive decision to try Rollin Smoke. It's in a pretty inconspicuous location, so keep your eyes peeled.   The restaurant was much larger and nicer looking than I had expected. Roomy, with plenty of seating, even booths which I always prefer, and very clean. You order at the podium and they bring your food out to you. Since there was a free dessert with Yelp check-in offer, I took advantage of this and ordered the pulled piggy sandwich with jalapeno coleslaw and peach cobbler. Our food came out quickly and everything smelled and tasted great! The meat was pretty good. I'm no expert, but I enjoyed my pulled pork quite a bit. The coleslaw was spicy and tasted pretty good. The cobbler was great too, but I would ask for no whipped cream next time. My family all love their meals as well. Some of the sides were hit or miss, but some of our favorites were the corn nuggets and coleslaw. The mac n cheese was ok, but I'd have to order it again to see if I like it better next time.   Their menu is quite extensive and they have so many great options that I look forward to exploring on our next visit. Overall, the experience was great and if they were in a more convenient location I could see myself coming here much more often. They have an all you can eat option for $25. I don't think I could handle it, but it seems like a pretty good deal. They also have family packs available for large parties, which is great.",

If you are looking for the absolute best tasting BBQ and the best service in Las Vegas, look no further than Rollin Smoke Barbecue. We had a team event, so I contacted Karina, catering manager. Many of our employees eat their regularly and love the food. I was more than pleasantly surprised. We had brisket, burnt ends and hot links and it was FABULOUS! We had several orders through the day, and orders were ready, on time, fresh and hot. Portions so large we even were able to enjoy leftovers the next day! The meat was so tender, and Karina even provided large bottles of their sauces so everyone could add flavor as they chose. We will definitely be using their catering again and visiting for lunch! Thanks Karina and team at Rollin Smoke!",

Location is easy to get to, small lot to park in. Having read how full it gets we went shortly after opening at 11 am to find no lines and only a few people dining. By the time we left an hour later, no tables left, line out the door so plan accordingly.  They offer 10% off when you show the coupon on their website! We went with a burger and waffle fries kids meal for my son and he enjoyed it, great waffle fries! I had the 2 slider combo with baked beans and enjoyed both the brisket and the pulled pork. Their sauces are amazing, my favorite was the mama's sweet, so tasty, drowned the meats in there, a soft hawaiian bun, it was too tasty. My husband had the 3 brisket sampler and only enjoyed the chopped one, the sliced was very dry and the burnt ends just soggy fat, so glad I passed on getting just an order of burnt ends. My husband had the mac n cheese and said it was pretty artificial and the baked beans were also just ok. In all, fantastic BBQ, I'll be back for the pulled pork and chopped brisket and their best ever BBQ sauces!",

Yep, it's the same seedy highland drive with all the strip joints. **Ordered**        - Pulled Pork - I've had a lot of pulled pork in my day, but nothing as tender and mouth watering as this. It's a must order.        - Brisket - Not like the dry briskets you'll get elsewhere. Their brisket is tender and flavorful.        - Beef Rib, Baby Back - Very meaty. Like I mean, TONS of meat on this bone. However, it's not really fall off the bone.        - Baby Back and Spare Ribs - The flavor of their rub and BBQ sauce is delicious, but the meat wasn't too tender.        - Catfish - Deep fried to perfection, but lacking in spices I'd say.        - Bacon Potato Salad - If you like potato salad, adding sweet sweet bacon to it is a no brainer.        - Corn Bread - Moist and hot out of the oven. You can't go wrong with corn bread.  **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you like BBQ. The brisket and pulled pork were my favorites.",

Romans 10 8 But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, \"Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.\" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For \"whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\"",

    "text": "BARBEQUE LOVERS TAKE NOTE The ratings on this place did not exaggerate at all.  This barbeque is among the very best I have ever eaten.  Being from the South, I can distinguish True smoked meat from the posers.  Rollin Smoke Barbeque is barbeque at its finest.  The meat has an excellent smoked flavor and the sauce complements it perfectly. The dishes here are unique and do an excellent job highlighting masterful barbequing skills.  I had the Barbeque sundae and highly recommend it.  With layers of mashed potatoes, beans, pulled pork and slaw, it combines all the perfect sides with the 'que in one handy cup.  The side of baked beans iI had were equally up to the task with the just the right amount of sweetness with a nice spicy bite as well.    Well done Rollin Smoke--I will return.",

    "text": "So Rollin' Smoke has been bookmarked for a good 6 months prior to our visit. Imagine the expectations that build up in 6 months; I already knew what I was going to have.  Pulled Pork Sandwich combo: I was pressured to get hush puppies, which were good for hush puppies (they have a little zing/spice to them from the jalapeno they mix in which made them better than average). As far as the pulled pork, it was some of the best I've had (although fattier than what I've had recently) however the bun it was served on left much to be desired. It was a hoagie type roll with sesame seeds, so the pork was trying to soak through the seem. Thankfully the sandwich didn't last long enough for me to make a huge mess of it.   Meat Duo: brisket and pulled pork. Jason said he's had better brisket, and prefers Memphis (cause he's a square!) but the pulled pork was good.   Check in dessert: Butterfinger Bread Pudding: it was tasty, good texture for a bread pudding- I would probably order a regular bread pudding if they were on special when we come back.  We both really liked the sauces they offer on the table (we tried the spicy and sweet sauces) and the service was friendly. They were definitely happy to have gained our business and made sure we really enjoyed our food.   We'll be back.",

We needed to hit it with a lot of sauce, otherwise they were too dry.  Speaking of the sauce, it was pretty decent, but it's a little spicy for my taste.  I think they should offer a regular in addition to the spicy sauce.  The pulled pork was average at best and was more like chunky pork.  The texture and flavor profile wasn't quite right.  The brisket was fairly bland as well.  Either they had an off night, or their meat supplier let them down.  The service and staff really delivered, however.  They were friendly and helpful.  I had much higher hopes for their BBQ based on the reviews.  Their pie and ice cream rocked.  Overall, a bit of a bummer.  I had hoped for 5 star grub.",

Pulled pork, brisket and mac and cheese were all very good. Very tender meat with a smoke flavor that was just right -- not overpowering at all. Sauce was slightly vinegary and was definitely peppery, as someone else mentioned, but I like that. Next time, I want to try the hot links and ribs.  And don't skip the banana pudding.  There's plenty of time for the chains. This is the kind of place that I hope both locals and tourists would support.",

Ordered the beef short ribs (not short at all, almost a lbs of meat), loaded mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Every single dish is phenomenal and the ribs are something special. The meat literally falls off the bone and is incredibly tender. The bbq sauce is just spicy enough and has perfect flavor. Love the atmosphere, just off the strip a little joint not hard to find. Great place 100% recommended!!!",

Only thing is the yams were a little too sugary but everything else was delicious!  Buy a shirt while you are here. They are funny!!",

Disclaimer, I don't eat pork.  So, I cannot speak on the goodness of the ribs and pulled pork.  But, what I can tell you is that the brisket (3 ways) was delicious.  My favorite of the three was the burnt ends.  The right amount of flavor and char.  FYI, they have an all you can eat option for a very resoanable price.  That affords the curious grubber a variety of options.  With that, I also tried the smoked chicken, shrimp, mac & cheese, fried okra, and corn nuggets.  My favorite of the sides: corn nuggets.  All the rest were meh.  Admittedly, I'm  a mac & cheese snob...so, it barely stood a chance.  Lastly the desserts...both the banana pudding and peach cobbler left me underwhelned.  At this point you may be wondering why 4 STARS?  The BBQ was excellent.  The service was outstanding. Lizelle welcomed us to the establishment and helped us to make the hard decision of what to get...  Overall, I would definitely come back.  I also recommend you check them out...",

They had already eaten there twice going there right when they open at 10am. We decided to check it out since they raved about the place. We ordered the sandwich platter and some ribs. Owner made an exception and gave us 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork. Homemeade BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy, the brisket was moist and very tender. Tasted great with some coleslaw on a pun. Pulled pork was a little dry but tasted fine. The ribs melted off the bone and were extremely flavorful. Perfect place to get some local food at a very good price. Owner was very nice and made sure our experience was good. Definitely a repeat place.",

My only regret was not ordering the buffet option and only being able to visit once. If I ever step foot in Vegas again, this is the spot I'll return to; and not just a single visit either.

It's definitely one of the best burgers that I've had.   My second visit was crappy. I ordered take out late at night. My fiance was craving sweet tea so I made sure to order that first. No problem the lady said. The sweet tea actually comes with the meals that we placed free of charge. I go to pick up my food and she hands me two cups. I go to pour myself the sweet tea to go but it's empty. I go up to the counter to let the employee know. She apologizes and tells me that she'll get a new one out. I'm waiting for a good 10 minutes, maybe not realizing that it's been 10 minutes because I was on my phone. A male employee walks out from the back and starts cleaning up. I politely ask him if he knows that status of my sweet tea and I inform him that the previous employee said that she would have it brought out. Well apparently, she is now off her shift and he knows nothing about it. He tells me that unfortunately, they're out of sugar and so there's no sweet tea at all until they get a shipment.   Ummm. Seriously? I realize that I'm the last customer there but they were a good hour away from their posted closing time. He apologizes for the inconvenience when in reality, he should have apologized for making up a piss poor lie and telling it to my face.  It's hard to believe that a establishment with that type of food would be out of sugar for it's sweet tea. I actually called the next day and lo and behold they did have sweet tea available. Hmmmm.  Again, they should be grateful that they're food is good.",

The chicken is deeply penetrated with flavour, but nothing comes close to the brisket. The sandwiches and sliders aren't dressed up, those sweet buns capture every drop of moisture (and believe me, you won't want to waste it). They also come dressed with simplicity; signature sauce and pickles, of course, the star attraction is the meat, and it is epic. Id also recommend trying those cross crossed fries - absolutely loaded with flavour, and the perfect thing to scoop up any escaped meat!",

We thought the pulled pork sandwich was ok, but honestly it's an unusual pick for us, we both think they need veggies to lighten the sandwich up. But the rib platter was f'ing amazing. HOLY CRAP. This is some quality meat here folks. The meat isn't dripping in sauce so the flavors of the meat shine through. And holy cow, the beef rib is incredible.

The BBQ sauce was also delicious! The mac & cheese was a little different, Cajun or spicy - not sure, but so cheesy and good! The bacon potato salad was a highlight of the meal - we loved every last bite! Also, the corn bread was some of the best I have ever had! The staff was very friendly and hospitable. Also, the place looked very clean and well kept! If you love BBQ this is a must go to in Vegas! Look forward to eating here again!",

    "text": "This is, by far, the best BBQ in Las Vegas.  Here's why: THE BUSINESS MODEL!!!  -great BBQ, including catfish and beef ribs and banana pudding and BBQ nacho fries; choices you don't find at many other BBQ places. -a family of charming characters who treat everyone like they were their best friend. -a menu that overcomes the \"combination\" curse.  What's that, you say?  A combination curse is a combination plate that isn't exactly what you want, but you order it anyway, because you have no other choice. At RSB, they overcome this curse because all elements of the BBQ universe are available \"a la carte\".  For example, I didn't want a brain-dead combination with a \"carb\" side and drink...I wanted nothing but protein. So I ordered, a la carte, a beef rib (gigantic!), a piece of white chicken and a piece of catfish. I dare you to find that \"combination\" at any other BBQ place in town.  It was sensational!  Oh and I almost forgot, one of the best burgers in town (next to Fat Choy) aptly named the \"Outlaw Burger\".  You eat The Outlaw Burger, and when you go outside, your car has magically morphed into a tricked-out Harley!!  If you're a local, you're crazy to go anywhere else. If you're a visitor, it's half a mile from the strip, just down the road from the Trump Tower.  Side note:  They should do a reality show at Rollin' Smoke.  If Pawn Stars, and Duck Dynasty, can be successful cable shows, a show set at this place can be blindingly, staggeringly successful!  Kind of a combination between the Diner shows and the Down-Home shows. More pleasure; more heart.",

    "text": "I'm a Southern girl, raised in TN. So, when I moved to Las Vegas, I just about gave up on finding anything near what we in the South call \"BBQ.\" Other places claim to have BBQ (ahem, Famous Dave's) but they DO NOT. Rollin Smoke is heaven on a spit. They know what they are doing and they do it well. If you are super hungry and want something that will hit the spot, go to Rollin Smoke. These guys are from the Carolinas (sorry, can't remember if it's North or South, apologies), and they do BBQ well. I won't go into whether this is dry rubbed or not because if you are from Las Vegas, you won't even know what I'm talking about anyway. Just go there if you want great BBQ here. You'll love it.   Also, for those folks who complain about Rollin Smoke running out BBQ, I have to remind folks who don't know that real BBQ takes time. Lots of time. Smoking is a dedicated process, and if this restaurant runs out of meat, they run out of meat. They can't magically smoke more in 30 minutes or less. So, get there early so you can get what you want. My kids had the pork sandwich and it was huge and they ate it all. The bacon potato salad is heaven. My husband had the 3 meat Brisket Dog, and loved it. I had the Smoked Meatloaf, and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I had plenty of leftovers for my husband and I to share. We saw (and were frightened of) the Outlaw Burger, as it was easily a foot tall. So, again, please note: Bring Your Appetite.   This is a \"get in line and order\" place, with seating in three different rooms. We loved sitting in the room with the \"Tanked\" fish tank that used to be their original smoker.",

Of those we enjoyed the Bacon Potato Salad the most.   The other items were all still tasty, but these meats and side were our favorites.   Greatly enjoyed taking our time eating this feast, and trying out the many different kinds of BBQ sauces offered.   I think they had at least six different sauces to slather on the meats.   My favorite was the mustard-based sauce.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas this weekend with my family and saw that Rollin Smoke BBQ was highly recommended on r/vegas/.   Upon entering for lunch, we saw that it was pretty busy, though we were only in line for about 5 minutes. We ordered the D's Delicious Sampler ($50) with Bacon Potato Salad and Loaded Mash for the sides.   The service was pretty good. The food came very quickly and we didn't wait long at all (maybe ~10 minutes, give or take a few). We ordered that party pack because it looked like it'd give us a good taste of what Rollin Smoke BBQ had to offer, and it didn't disappoint.   I can't say I'm a expert at eating BBQ (with only Lucille's and Phil's for comparison), but my family and I were very pleased with the St. Louis spare ribs. The meat was very tender and came right off the bone. The sauce, which we got on the sides, were pretty decent. Out of the possible 4, one of the best ones were the Sweet Country Girl and Mama's Sweet D-Licious; they weren't like your run-of-the-mill BBQ sauce. The Spicy sauce and the vinegar were mediocre, so we didn't get too much of those. The sides were very good too, though we never had the chance to finish them.  For a family of 4 (parents and two 18+ men), I was surprised that the $50 party pack filled all of us up, even to where we couldn't finish the sides. And I daresay we had quite an appetite already.   If you're visiting Vegas and you haven't come here, I recommend coming at least once to see what it has to offer!",

I've visited rolling smoke a total of three times, and every time I try something different that was just as good, if not better than the last item.  First a warning, as soon as you walk into this place, you will experience an instant uncontrollable flow of saliva. The smell is just AMAZING! Now that you've been warned, lets begin with the menu. My absolute favorite is the rib plate and the brisket. The ribs are tender, full of flavor and just come off the bone with ease. The brisket is equally as delicious, with a good variety of BBQ sauces to complement the already great smoked flavor.   A few tips: The place to me seems a little hidden, so GPS it for easy directions. You WILL come out smelling like smoke. The staff is helpful, so if you are unsure of what to get, just ask for their recommendations.   Bon appetit!",

Like John Coffey would say, \" the sauce is the boss, Boss.\" After finishing the meal...\" I'm tired, Boss. Dog Tired.\"   Spare Ribs- Fall off the bone tender. Brisket- juicy. Pulled Pork- chopped to perfection. Chicken- tasty, skin and all. Hot Link- just the right amount of spice. The blueberry cobbler- \"Heaven , I'm in Heaven...\" The sides, bbq beans- great white rice topper! Corn Nuggets- should have ordered double. Mac & cheese- cheesy and Deeelish!!!   Once a year I just might have to do the All-you-can-Eat for $35 but wouldn't eat for 3 days before going and just drink water. I must agree with all the reviews here...

A lot of scenery but you if are not paying attention, you will drive right by this place while looking at all of the craziness that is Las Vegas (hookers, cracktivity and strip clubs). Great smokey flavor on the food. The brisket, ribs and chicken are all very good. I honestly believe this is the best BBQ joint in Vegas. My opinion and I'm usually right, once again, my opinion. Customer service is great and food comes out fast. This place stays busy and has outdoor seating. There is always a line to order but the line moves fast.",

Saw the picture of the BBQ nacho fries and had to try. Was a giant mound of meat, gooey cheese, sour cream, beans, and waffle fries. The entire thing must have weighed 2 pounds. It was quantity over quality because it so lacked flavor. I got half way through and stopped because I was bored.",

I ordered the trio with pulled pork,brisket, and chicken with sides of potato salad and Mac and cheese. Hubby had the pit master plate with the same meats but also had ribs. He ordered the coleslaw and hush puppies.  We both agreed the pork was our favorite. Very tender and a little fatty but that just enhances the flavor.   My favorite side was the potato salad. Creamy and flecked with bits of bacon and green onion. Very tasty. Coleslaw was good too. Hushpuppies were very good also with bits of onion inside. The corn bread was sweet and super delicious!  The service was fast and our cashier/food server was friendly.  Will go back and try the baby back ribs next time.",

A no frills setting with bench and park bench seating. Wasn't too hard to find either. The menu offered some great choices.  I went with the half rack baby back ribs, beans and cole slaw. Man the Kicken beans was kicken. So tasty. The cole slaw didn't appeal to me too much. My wife loved it.  The ribs were very tender and tasty.  Adding their BBQ sauce only made it better. We also ordered corn bread. Omg that was da bomb. Buttery and soft. I really can't say enough abt this place. My only regret is that I don't live in Vegas. But hey it's a great reason to come back.",

It's close to a strip club, adult stores, etc. Tits and BBQ - this is a man's restaurant. The BBQ aroma fills the air inside the restaurant and sticks to your hair and clothes (had to shampoo my hair twice).  The food was amazing!  I'm not the biggest fan of ribs so, for me to like this place is a major deal. We had a meat Trio: brisket, pork and ribs with waffle fries and Mac n cheese. I liked everything we got. The meats were tender, juicy and smokey. I poured some house BBQ sauce on the meats for more flavor. The waffle fries were very crispy and I wanted to order more. The Mac n cheese has a smokey taste to it as well but was runny...still damn good though. The chicken sandwich and a black berry cobbler were ok.  This is not a fast-food restaurant so, expect to wait about 20 minutes or more to get your food. It's worth the wait.",

As lip smacking good as the ribs were it was the chicken that stole the show for me. I should have opted for all you can eat deal. I could easily eaten two of these plates. Mom went with the pulled pork. Two thumbs up and 5 stars from her. I had to order some peach cobbler a la mode when I ordered extra Mac and cheese. Home run.

For a full rack of beef ribs I would've expected more than 4 bones though, especially for $35 I believe it was. And the baby backs were $28. And they both did not come with ANY sides. We ordered full racks and they come with nothing but a sliced piece of bread.... we did pay for sides and had their super delicious mac n cheese, beans and bacon potato salad. I think with tip we spent about $80 with 2 iced teas. Not a bad lunch but just a little bit more than what we're used to paying for lunch.",

Nothing was dry or over cooked which happens a some BBQ restaurants. The crew working today for lunch were very upbeat and inviting.  Not sure who this Rick character is that has his name on the place, but he has a solid crew working for him!  This was our first visit and will now be a on our must return list!  Thank you for the great experience today!",

I have to admit pulling up to it in a small shopping center in the middle of nowhere was a little odd, but once you open the door and enter the place, it's a whole different world.  The nicest people ever work here, the guys at the register that take your order are so friendly, the ones that bring out your food to your table and super friendly, nice people come here to eat, and everyone was happy and friendly.  The corn nuggets and yams are the best side dishes ever.  The ribs were good, the chopped brisket was delicious, links are spicy but good, great portions, great side dishes, perfect seating on large tables to accommodate big parties.  I will definitely come back when I visit Vegas again.  I don't always like the crowded restaurants in the casinos, so this place was great on a night that we arrived and were very casual and just wanted a quick bite.  Thanks Rollin Smoke, keep up the awesome work, great service, and yummy food.",

So my husband and I decided to go with the pit special so we could try as many meats and sides as possible. I'm just going to say you can't go wrong with any of the BBQ fare. The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links- all amazing! The hot links were nice and spicy and all the other meat was super tender and delectable.  The beans were a great side- thick and chunky with big pieces of pork mixed throughout. Yum yum. The potato salad had crispy pieces of bacon on top which launched it into a new level of awesome-ness. The fried okra was perfectly breaded and fried. No extra salt required. The mac and cheese just seemed like a dud next to all the other sides, so I'd skip that one if possible. As for the dessert- the peach cobbler was too much peach and not enough cobbler. You could tell that they used a canned peach to make it and it was just not doing it for me. The peach cobbler wasn't the best, but maybe i'll try the banana pudding next time.",

I ordered the brisket and the pulled pork. Meal also comes with 2 sides and enough rolls for 4 sandwiches. We ordered the kickin beans and the Mac-n-Cheese. The brisket was not what I expected it was chopped very fine which is good I guess for sandwiches. ( I hope it is not that way in a meal). Pulled pork was excellent and the sauce was good with just right amount of spice. The Beans were a bit too peppery for my tastes but some may enjoy it. Mac-n-Cheese was marginal but not crazy good also heavy use of pepper. Great filling meal, great taste overall. Will go back to try more menu items.",

    "text": "Here's the deal. For a while, I've been searching for authentic BBQ here in the city. Chains restaurants like Dave's and Lucille's are great but missing more of that southern down home feel. Enter Rollin Smoke, located in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, this small eatery is does everything right.  We got here around the lunch rush, and had to wait in a small line to order. The host/cashier was Dusty I believe, friendly guy, and he was quick and attentive. Because the staff is well prepared, the food was out within 10 minutes, very quick for a BBQ establishment, and it shows great preparation.  I ordered the Pit Special, and for 20 bucks you get a pick of 4 meats, 3 sides and a drink. That's enough food for 2 meals or to share. I ordered a piece of the catfish on the side, which was very good as well. Catfish is hard to perfect because you have to cook it through but not over cook it. I'm willing to attest that the catfish is about as legit as it gets.  The meat itself was fantastic, the ribs were tender but not greasy. It was nice and smoky with a good texture. Someone on here said the ribs weren't \"fall off the bone\", which  is correct. That's not to say it's tough, because it's not. Being smoked they way they are, they aren't greasy, they pull off the bone with very little effort. That's better than greasy, mushy \"fall off the bone\" people talk about when they use that phrase.  The sides were fantastic. The loaded mash was pretty good, not as good as some of the garlic mash I've had, BUT, excellent in it's own right. The mac and cheese was great. I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, and nothing is as good as my moms homemade, but this was better than most BBQ/Southern restaurants. My one and only complaint was that the food could have been a bit warmer. That's it.   For not much money you can eat like a king. Fast friendly staff, and great food makes this hidden gem a winner in my eyes.",

My knowledge of barbeque is limited, but I mean I own a Traeger Grill, does that count for anything? No? I didn't think so either... but while my Traeger makes deliciously smoked clean meats it doesn't compare to the smokey glistening glory of RSB. Their ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ is what makes Vegas or America in general really freaking awesome. I mean sure we're in the top 10 for most obese countries, but hey at least we do it right, RIGHT?   The special is $25 and includes EVERYTHING on the menu, except drinks ($2), you gotta buy that, BUT... its pretty much all you can drink too. Don't pass on the Outlaw Burger,  the beef ribs, or the nachos, but do pass on the pulled pork. Don't wear a belt, its useless, no belt will make look skinny after the massacre. You can of course also just order ala carte.  Take the booth with the pig, it will give you extra encouragement when you savage through his four legged cousins.   CONVENTION PEOPLE... COME HERE!  How was my review? DAMNNNNNNN GEWDDDDDDDDDD right? Thanks!",

That lets you know that this place is jammin.  Apparently you can call in the order and they'll have it ready when you come get it, (total plus in my book).  It's a little confusing to get to, but that shouldn't stop you at all.    I got the Spudtastic with brisket and a side of Bacon Potato Salad.  Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! This will definitely become a lunch/dinner regular for me.  The line never went down while we were there.  Picnic style seating.  We sat at a table with some other people while waiting for their food and everybody was so nice.  Staff and regulars.  Anybody who says this place is okay, and that  it isn't like \"back home\" is obviously prejudiced to wherever \"back home\" is.  This place is awesome and definitely worth coming to!!",

For $50 we got 1/4 lbs of ribs, 1/4 lb of brisket and 1/4 lb pulled pork as well as 8 rolls and 2 big sides. For the side I strongly recommend the BBQ beans and their amazingly cheesy Mac and cheese. Lets say we got our  money's worth and more.  To burn of the calories we walked across a small parking lot to visit the infamous GOLD AND SILVER PAWN as seen in the hit show PAWN STAR. FYI THIS BBQ PLACE IS ALSO OWNED BY THE SAME OWNER AS THE PAWN SHOP ( RICK) If a trip to Vegas is in your near future... hit up this place and eat like a king for less than  $60.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE GOING TO RICK' S ROLLIN BBQ EVERY TIMES I VISIT VEGAS.  IT'S ONLY FEW MILES AWAY FROM THE FAMOUS VEGAS STRIP. ENJOY!!!",

    "text": "Saturday night in Vegas and we were planning on meeting up with our friends for dinner and some fun. The first place we planned to go to was not getting too many rave reviews. Stephanie S. had the wonderful idea to come here instead for dinner. This place was pretty close to where we were staying on the strip, which made it easy drive for us. Located on the other side of the strip (yes on the seedy side of town) pass a couple of popular strip joints, made a turn thinking did my GPS give me the wrong directions because it's really dark on this street and it looks like it's the industrial area of Vegas. Well you are in the industrial area but it is also a mix of other business as well. Rollin Smoke is in a small shopping center look for a sign that says \"Kiesub Center\" and you have found it! Did I mention that they are open until 1:30 am every day too?  As we were pulling into the parking lot, I notice two huge bbq smokers outside. Knowing that anything that is put into a smoker is going to be mighty tasty I was ready to order right there in the parking lot!  Walking into this eatery the BBQ smell hits you like a mack truck on the 15. Their menu is large and in charge!   Everything from an all you can eat BBQ for $24.99 (you get anything on their menu, anytime, any day of the week)  $7.99 sandwich's (like the pulled piggy, smoked brisket ECT) $8.99 meals (BBQ nacho fries, various wraps, outlaw burger and many options that are more wonderful to choose from)  Then there are the various plates that they have. Minh and I decided on ordering and splitting The Pit Special:   Four meats (of your choice) and three sides (of your choice) - Brisket, Chicken, two orders of spare ribs. Bacon Potato Salad, Yams, and Corn Nuggets all for $19.99!  They took Minh's name down and we seated our self's in an over sized booth. The owner was there making sure everything was running smoothly. This is a family owned business, which makes it have that charming-family-cozy kind of feeling. As we were waiting for our food and other friends to arrive, I was chatting with Stephanie and watching the small eatery fill up with hungry families, club-goers and other various walks of life wanting some stick to your ribs goodness.   A friendly server brought our food to our table. All I can say is the Pit Special offers a lot of food for your money! There is more than enough to share with another person.   The corn nuggets were the best ever! Fried on the outside (no grease on any of the balls) and yet soft and fluffy in middle. I was popping these in two at a time (sorry babe if you only got a couple). There are addicting!   The bacon potato salad was another favorite, chucks of potatoes various seasonings, mayo and probably mustard piled with bits of delicious bacon.  Swoon!  All the meats were tender (they \"rub\" their own meats daily) you can taste the quality of the meats they have. Not one piece was dry; we did try their homemade BBQ sauce, which was delightful on the brisket. The chicken and ribs had so much meat on it I got overwhelmed for a second.   This place is a gem in hiding, BBQ in sin city at its best! To the Holland family thank you for making this delicious food for every kind of budget!",

The beef ribs were charred a lil too hard and not very flavorful - $18.99 for 2 bones, I expected more. The smoked chicken came out cold and again wasn't anything spectacular. The wings are a great size, fried well, and come out hot! The lemon pepper rub, however was not good (and I looove lemon pepper wings). It tasted like someone prepared wings and dumped the seasoning on them with no concern for blending the seasoning in. I sent them back and ordered BBQ wings Togo, fingers crossed they are better. The sliced brisket was good :-). The greens and yams were good. The cornbread was AMAZING! Overall, star was nice, but food was just not what I hoped for :-(.",

Parked in front, was immediately greeted by Mike (the owner I think). Super nice guy, helped us choose our menu items and was genuinely appreciative that we came in. Love that.  We sat ourselves at a picnic table and our food came out shortly. Hubs had a trio of sliders and they were huge! I had the pulled piggy sandwich. Portions were big and sides were super seasoned and greasy in a good way. Hangover cure! The brisket and chicken sliders were seriously amazing. Best I've had anywhere. The pulled pork was also very good. Super tender and no fat.   We got a free hot peach cobbler a la mode for checking in on yelp. Heck yes!  Our ONLY suggestion would be better buns and more sauce on the table. Overall, this place is great with amazing service. We'll be back next time we're in Vegas!",

It's not far from the strip in distance, yet feels a million miles away.  This hole in the wall restaurant feels like it was transported from some small town down south, not the glitz of Las Vegas (in a good way).  Your olfactory sensors are hit with the heavenly smell of smoked meat even before you cross the threshold (prepare to leave with a new smoke cologne too).    You counter order and pick up your utensils before heading to a table.  You can sit at the picnic tables by the counter, or cross over into the dining room that houses additional tables and a couple TVs.  Tables are equipped with a roll of paper towels and their signature BBQ sauce, which is a little sweeter than traditional Texas sauce, but good.  This trip we got combo plates of Sliced Brisket with Fried Okra and Pulled Pork with Kicken Beans and Jalapeno Coleslaw.  The brisket and pork were perfect.  Both tender and smokey.  The pork had some awesome burnt end pieces that were fantastic.  The fried okra was good.  The Kicken Beans had some heat and pieces of the smoked meats in the sauce.  Definitely a side I would order again!  I did not care for the Jalapeno Coleslaw too much.  It had a bunch of black pepper that overwhelmed the flavor of the dish.  I need to remember to keep this place in the rotation a little more often!",

However, the food shines bright! Especially the World Famous Meat Loaf!! Sooo soft that u cant distinguish the meat from the mashed potato.  Just a delicious soft gooeyness that melts in your mouth.  The ribs are good too but I can say that I've had better ribs before.  Quite an experience, from the ambiance of the neighborhood to the melt in your mouth meat loaf.  But proceed with caution, I would have been quite nervous if there weren't the entire Las Vegas Police Department dining with us in the restaurant that day loll",

I will definitely want to come back to try their ribs since I didn't get the chance to.  Also ordered  their outlaw burger which was one of their famous item on the menu and was voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" to be honest  burger was disappointing. It looked good and was great for pictures but it was a dry burger and not what I am used to. I guess you were suppose to just lather on the BBQ sauce. The burger was huge though!",

The beef rib was big meaty smokey and so soft, I flaked the meat off the bone with just a fork like I was eating cake.  I thought the burnt ends were a little over sauced, though they were pretty good.  The collared greens were cooked just right, and the brisket chunks were a nice touch.  The nice people sitting next to my party had corn nuggets, and let me try one.  They are little balls of cornbread stuffed with actual corn nibblets (really good).

I got the duo choice of meat with sliced briskets and two spare ribs. The meat was tender, full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. I like sauce on my barbecue and their Arkansas sauce did not disappoint. The sweet bbq sauce was  also great although their spicy sauce was a bit underwhelming. Portions are great and filling, you get your money's worth here.   The sides were just as outstanding. I got a side of mac and cheese and corn nuggets. Best mac and cheese I've had! Not many restaurants meet my expectations for good mac and cheese, but theirs were all the right amounts of cheesy flavor and taste. The corn nuggets were also amazing and rightfully hyped. They were a great combination of crispy on the outside and sweet inside with bits of corn.  If you're a fan of barbecue, you must make a stop here on your next Vegas trip, I certainly will!",

Rib Platter - $24.99 - Comes with 1 beef rib, 2 spare ribs, and 3 baby back ribs. I love when bbq places have combos like this because I love to try everything they offer. Beef rib was huge and had tender flakey meat. Spare rib fell off the bone and was moist. Baby backs were a little dry. Seasoning was peppery with a little hint of sweet. My side was the Corn Nuggets which were like cream corn poppers, so good.  Brisket, fatty, 1lb - $18.99 - Meat melted in your mouth. You can pull it apart with your fingers.   Half Smoked Chicken - $9.99 - Good smoke. Had some good juicy meat but some pieces were dry.  Burnt Ends, 1/2lb - $12.99 -  Disappointing. Not moist or fatty. Very little bark. They do not allow quarter pound orders either.",

The brisket was so tender, the meat just fell apart and melted in your mouth. They also offer several different dipping sauces, all you can eat on the sauce at no extra charge.  I found out the owner is originally from the south which explains why the BBQ is so spot on. He really brought his roots to Las Vegas!",

The ribs are flavorful and fall off the flipping bone. Meaty as hell too! You have to try the chopped beef with the MAMA sauce.   Their CORNBREAD  / YAMs Owns!!

Outside was super crispy, and inside was sweet and moist with little bits of corn kernels.  This item definitely sets this place apart from other BBQ places.  The house made habanero paste sauce was also excellent.    My wife and I ordered the trio meat combo with pulled brisket, 1/4 lb chicken, and hot links.  The brisket was juicy with a nice smoked flavor; chicken was tender and flavorful; and hot links were spicy with a nice snap to them.  I put some Carolina vinegar on the brisket which helped cut down some fat and added a refreshing flavor to the meat.  The house BBQ sauce was tasty although a bit watery so I mixed some of the habanero paste to thicken it up.  They tasted pretty good together.  The sweet BBQ sauce, which tasted like honey mustard, was also pretty good, and went well with the hot links.  Service was friendly.  Chef and some of the staff members walked around greeting people and making sure everyone was doing ok.    Seating is set up in a family style with picnic benches and tables.    This will definitely be one of the stops we make whenever we are in Vegas.  We actually walked over here from The Trump Hotel despite it being in a sketchy area.  It was fine in the day but I probably would be too scared to walk here at night.",

I'm not comparing NC BBQ to Vegas BBQ, but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. I should have noticed the word \"pulled\" pork as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork. The pork itself was smoky and tender. Long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll. I added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake. The coleslaw (ugh) had chucky bits of cabbage stalk, jalapenos, carrots, corn and I swear I saw bacon in the mix. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't salty; It added nothing to the meal. The mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious. Oddly enough, it tasted like potatoes au gratin I just bought from the store.   Aside from that awful coleslaw experience I would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are a bit high and I wish tried something that was just amazing! I will have to go back when they aren't charging full prices such as after 5pm. Perhaps, the ribs and brisket are better.",

This is one of THE best we've ever been, topping over many of the so called famous spots in Texas. We had the brisket three ways, along with a side of fried okra and Mac n' cheese. All five stars. This was the first time we had ever been to this spot, but the five star service could also not be ignored. Locals were giving employees hugs, and we must've been asked 3-4 times how we were enjoying our food. Dusty kept bringing people samples of other meats to try. We heard that they have recently teamed up with the Pawn Star guys to open another location. Smart men!! We will be back!!!",

They came out and told me they were out of peach cobbler so I had the berry cobbler instead. If you love cobbler like I do, do NOT order it here!  It is not really cobbler but more like berries poured on top of a cornbread and topped with whip cream.   My overall meal was good, and my friends had more success with their meals so I give it an overall 4 stars",

    "text": "Nom, nom, nom!  Rollin Smoke Barbeque is an awesome place to get barbecue in Las Vegas!  Seriously, if you're visiting Vegas or live there, just try it, you'll love it.  They are located in an almost industrial center part of town, and there's not a whole lot of parking, especially when they are busy.  They are right down the street from our go to Tattoo shop, so they are really convenient for us to grab a to go order when someone's tattoo is going to take all day.  They also have two dining areas and seating outside too if you'd rather eat in.   The portions are huge; my boyfriend and I can share one of their two or three meat platters easily.  On this most recent visit we ordered two of the three meat platters.  One for us to share, and one for the two teenage boys to share.  For under $40, all four of us were completely stuffed and we still had leftovers.   For our platter we had ribs, pork and brisket with the bacon potato salad and banana pudding.  The ribs were falling off the bone, the pork was flavorful and juicy and the brisket was really tender.  I grabbed a few extra containers of their sauce, but we didn't need it because the meats were great on their own.  The service is excellent even when they are busy.  I'll be honest, we're heading back to Vegas at the end of the month, and I think Rollin Smoke might be one of the things I'm looking forward to the most!",

The beef ribs were tender , moist and flavorful they had 2  kinds of sauces  which I don't like mustard base and vinegar base sauces maybe they should have a sweet sauce for people as well. The string beans could have been cooked longer but good flavor. If you're ever in Vegas check out this BBQ spot.",

    "text": "Highland Dr and Industrial Rd are better known for their close proximity to the Las Vegas glittery night life, where even the least physically attractive individuals can lease the personal attention of barely clothed seductive sirens $20 at a time.  But thanks to Rollin' Smoke Barbeque, this same area will also be known for down to earth, simply delicious BBQ.   On a recent weekday evening, a handful of coworkers decided to meet here post work to try some BBQ that Nelson Q has proudly put his 5 Yelp stars stamp of approval on. In typical fashion, I was the first to arrive.  The parking lot was empty except for 2 cars, all the other businesses were closed, and there was a guy in suits finishing his early dinner.  The restaurant itself is very low key. It housed nothing flashy in terms of decorations, except for a big boar's head mounted on one of the walls. The lobby/ordering counter is in a small room, but the main dining area is in the adjacent room. The seats are comfortable, and there is a TV for you to watch sports or highlights, while you wait for your order.  Most of us opted to try the Outlaw Burger. For $6.99 + tax, this burger is the size of two of my fists stacked on top of each other.  It is packed with a 1 lb patty (60% brisket and 40% ground beef) and cooks down to about 12 oz, served with Rollin' Smoke's homemade tangy BBQ sauce, the usual vegetable fixings and some (lettuce, tomato, fried onions, scallions, and cheese) which not only made it physically big but the flavors complimented each other and resulted in a mean serving of burger that I can easily recommend to anyone not opposed to eating pork and beef.  For $2, you get a drink and choice of one side (bacon potato salad would be a good pick), and make your order a combo.  Currently there is also a Yelp Check-In promotion, where you get a complimentary dessert with your order.  Rollin' Smoke BBQ, now my personal #1 one pound burger in LV.  Decor:  3/5  No frills hole in the wall restaurant. You are here because you want good BBQ, not design ideas for your Texas ranch.  Food:  4/5  Good BBQ made with passion and love.  They serve Blue Belle ice cream too (coworkers said it reminded them of the ice cream in the Philippines. I will take their words for it.)  Value:  4/5  Good for the wallet. I estimate that 65%+ of you will not be able to finish the Outlaw Burger, side + drink.  Location:  5/5  Not far at all if you are visiting the Strip.  The cabbies will probably know it too, if not, it is just down the street from Sapphire.   Parking:  5/5  It is practically all for Rollin' Smoke BBQ customers.  Easily 4 stars!  P.S.  If you stop by during lunch, I heard this is where some of them sirens get their lunch/breakfast before/after work. So I've heard.",

    "text": "So my husband and I went to this bbq establishment because he knows I love bbq, and he actually tried this place first with his boss. He claimed it was great and \"YES\" it is. It is the best I have had here in Vegas. The price is not bad at all either. The establishment is a little small but as usual, the best places are hidden and small somewhere in town. I had a hamburger  that just looked delicious to me in the picture I saw there, so I ordered it but once I got it, boy was that HUGE!!!! The onion strips on the burger were so dang flavorful and crispy just the way I love crunchy onions to be. The meat is just full of greatness and I dare say a piece of heaven. My husband had some ribs and brisket, I had to try the ribs and those as well were not disappointing at all. To top it all off, the couple of employees we had interactions with were very graceful and welcoming. Most of all the place looked clean and did not have a funky smell, the way some places do. I do recommend this bbq Vegas hidden secret to anybody that loves a good bbq meal. :) I will be going there again. :)",

    "text": "Years in, thousands and thousands of customers later, Rollin Smoke is STILL maintaining a great restaurant. The recent popularity of American beef in developing nations has caused our prices to skyrocket. Personally, I can't believe I am paying what used to be \"steak\" prices for brisket (in 2000, brisket was about $1.50 a pound. Now, it's around $3-4 at retail), but that's the reality of the situation. Rollin' Smoke recently had to increase the price of their AYCE option and the rest of the menu should be creeping up soon, but there's nothing they can do.  I never thought I'd pay $53 for a brisket when I cook Q, but welcome to 2015.  I've been a handful of times (every three or four weeks) and perhaps it's talking Q with the owner, perhaps it's because I'm from Arkansas, he remembers my name. I'm not a big customer, but by golly, that's awesome.  They're still doing great meat and great service. This is top of the line barbecue and I have no hesitation to happily recommend it to my friends.",

Im.mot sure if it was the meat or the rice that was hard but it was gross. Only ate 2 bites of that. The pork, brisket and spare robs were good and the bbq sauce was good as well. It the sides tasted it better I would have gave  5 stars. Maybe I caught them on a bad night.",

    "text": "Got call from leader of asian persuasion pack Terri R about trying someplace new out and ALWAYS stay down for trying new spots in town. More so ones that fellow yelpers rave about. Not sure the last time had some good old fashion ribs. So excited too get down and dirty. Talk about epitome of Hole in the Wall. Industrial Rd not exactly the prettiest road in Vegas but great for gentlemen clubs. Anyway so for second thinking going too one only too pass it and then once did get too Rollin Smoke Barbeque look down the street shocker another one. Once you do get here the smell from the pits literally parked right outside in the parking lot (I have no idea when they start but assume in the morning) and them ribs block out everything. I think Hole in Wall places have so much personality and character ALL its own.   Once get inside the menu is fairly small but they do have chalkboard with their daily specials. You go up too the cashier too order then they bring the food out too you. You sit wherever you like or have room. They have two room adjacent too one another and other room talk about personality on the walls with the art. How can you not love the boars head or pig head looking over the restaurant from one corner? They do still T-shirts that like the logo but next time go get one of kind T-shirt.   I decided too get The Trio plate. What better way too try little of everything or get my meat in. They out of the hot link so got double order of the pork. My sides went with the mac and cheese. I also ordered side of The Kickin Baked Bean. The pork was excellent! I could easily see myself tearing up pull pork sandwich. Guess is one of there more popular items. The ribs were solid little bit different style then the ones more use too but still solid. Wish could tell you about the hot links but save that for another review. The sides the mac and cheese was really good. It not cheesy cheesy but not runny also so had nice balance. The Kickin Baked Beans now that am FAN. I enjoyed the pieces of pork or beef that in it. I really did have nice little kick spice level too them. Even though it small menu fell like lot more thing for me too try.  The prices talk about reasonable priced! Compare too some of the other franchise places this place is a steal. You get so much more personality and one of kind experience. Under $20 you can fill yourself up with any combination and still have enough for desserts. The service is awesome! Small business owners that sense the personnel touch all around. It small place so just make sure you beat the crowd cause the place can fill out quick. If never been Rollin Smoke Barbeque someplace check out or fill like mixing up one night.   Thanks my partners Mel C and Terri R!!! You guys rock!!",

The aesthetics is the restaurant isn't anything appealing but the BBQ was fantastic. The meat falls off the short ribs like butter, the pulled pork and brisket was juicy and marinated well. I didn't think the chicken was as good compared to the the other meat options but the chicken was moist and good nonetheless. And LET'S TALK SIDES. I ordered the fried okra, corn puppies, cole slaw and corn bread and they were all AMAZING. A must try for those meat lovers and comfort food lovers.",

    "text": "I love BBQ and try to hit different spots nationwide.  I was in Vegas and wanted to do off-Strip stuff this time around.  We decided to give this place a try given the great reviews.  Location, we are talking about a dark street next to a gentleman's club akin to uber hole in the wall.  Only in Vegas!  So we were greeted at the door by a taxidermed hog and in front of us in line were three police officers... My thoughts-heck yah we were in for something good!  Customer service was top notched.  I ordered the 1/2 rack baby backs ($17.99) and a pound of the brisket ($10.99).  Floored that sides were not included as with typical BBQ spots, which makes the pricing on the expensive side.    Baby backs came out and the color was a rich coffee grind black and just brilliant.  I was expecting some excellent bark.  But, oh Romeo, alas it was not meant to be!   There was no texture to the bark although the meat did fall off the bones.  The dry rub was mehhhh.   The three sauces had a more watery consistency than traditional BBQ sauces, which is absolutely fine.  There were three varieties - mama sweet, house, and BBQ.  The house had a nice balance between sweet and vinegar and was our favorite.  The brisket had what amounted to a peppercorn rub.  They love the peppercorn at this place. Perhaps it was the end of the night, but it came out very dry.   We ended up not eating most of it it, which was a shame.     While dining, we eavesdropped on a conversation.  Apparently this is Rick's (of Pawn Star fame) favorite spot and he and Rollin teamed up to open another spot in Rick's strip center by his pawn shop.   Well, sounds like Rick is rollin in the dough with his Rollin location, which we will check out next time we are in town.  Overall 3.5 stars. Not good enough to round to 4 though considering we've had so much better nationwide.",

Ultimately I thought the place was overpriced and seemed very commercialized. They also glorify their standing on Yelp, I am glad I tried it, but next time I am in Vegas I will be on the hunt for another BBQ joint.   Not to mention it's pretty cheesy how the workers ask you to give them a 5 star review on yelp, and even go as far as giving you a post it note with all their names on it. Come on now.",

Not a far drive from the strip, we were impressed by the many 4+ star reviews. Like many small bbq restaurants in the South and Midwest, they offered all the regular meats: brisket, sausage or hot links, BBQ Chicken, ribs, and pulled pork.  They offered a good selection of sides as well, and I ordered the 3 meat combo (brisket with 2 orders of pork ribs) with loaded mash as my sides.    The food was decent, but not great unfortunately. The pork was definitely fall of the bone tender, and the brisket was very dry and didn't have a great taste to it. They did offer a good selection of sauces to go along with the meat, but it didn't really help and I was really looking forward to some good bbq.  The problem may have been that it was 11:30pm and the food was being kept warm from earlier in the evening, but I'm still judging it based on what it was served. Maybe I'll come back during the day when the food was freshly cooked and it will be better.",

I got the double meat plate with 2 orders of ribs (4 ribs total) and bacon potato salad for the side. So delicious! The meat was so tender and full of flavor. It had a beautiful smoke ring on it and the house sauce was a perfect compliment to the rich, smokey meat.   The reason I gave 3 stars is because of the cashier. He could not crack a smile if his life depended on it. After the person in front of me was done ordering, I gave him a second to finish up until he called us and was ready to take our order. When he did, he acted like we were the stupid ones for not immediately coming up and bombarding him with our order. It was pure attitude from there. He has zero people skills or manners. No, \"thank you,\" \"you're welcome,\" or \"enjoy,\" from him during the transaction. I don't need someone bursting with energy but at least have basic manners.",

Collard greens go down real easy.  Bbq beans have chunks of beef making it feel and taste like a stew.     This food is so amazing i had to stop in the middle of my lunch and write this review.   Oh--and the bbq sauces.  They have a spicy, a sweet, a vinegar, a mustard-y, and a couple others for good measure.   I drank a cupful of the mama sweet sauce it was so good.    Very easy to make a case for this place being the best i've ever had.",

Brisket is sliced thin....I prefer thicker cuts but the cook is great.  Nice balance in taste and not overly smoked or injected.  I like all brisket.....I just feel that thinner cuts lose some flavor. Hot Links are pretty solid....not a huge hot link fan but these are tasty and have a good depth of flavor for sure.  Sauces are awesome.  House sauce is real dang good but I gravitated more toward the Carolina Vinegar.  Had the Mac n Cheese, too.....super good.  Cheesy with the right amount of savory smack!  I was visiting Vegas but I will definitely be back here for future LV visits....",

Juicy, smoky bbq goodness, done to near perfection (if not, perfection). I like the ribs, and the chicken, but the pulled pork, brisket, and other dishes are also worth their salt. The corned bread is some of the best I have tasted. The baked beans, mac and cheese, and veggies are no slouch, either.  I just ordered a platter for a birthday party, and it was scrumptious. Everyone, young and old, enjoyed the food.  The best part is the owner came out and brought the platter to my car. He is that humble. No wonder he is so successful.  God speed!",

I've decided to get Trio of meats with one side so did my friend who came with me so we can taste as much as we can. I picked Brisket, Two Spare ribs and 1/4 chicken and I must say everything was delicious. I don't wanna use the \"melt in your mouth\" term so...everything dissolved and fell off the bone. Waffle fries were a great side as well. Meat quality and smoking was great but the sauces weren't all the amazing honestly(Personal opinion) although its on the side and you can just pick any sauce you want / try or none at all very optional.  I'll definitely be coming back and recommending this place to people.",

Every bite of meat was succulent and perfectly cooked. There's the perfect smoke flavor. Mama Sweet was my favorite sauce with a perfect balance of sweet.

We both got the chopped brisket sandwich. I got macaroni and cheese as my side and David got the BBQ beans. The brisket was very, very good. Excellent flavor, generous portion. I liked the variety of sauces, the sweet BBQ sauce in the large dispenser was our favorite. The mac and cheese was good, very creamy, with extra grated cheese on top. David raved about the beans, quite spicy but excellent. We both felt the roll for the sandwich was a lot of bread and didn't add a lot. We might get plates next time but we wish those came with two sides instead of one. Of course we could add a side. The sandwich was served with pickle chips but some chopped onion would have been nice.  People were very friendly. This place is a keeper. I bet we'll visit again on our next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "The BBQ was good, but the sides were disappointing.  I had my mind all set on beef ribs, but when I got to the counter to order they were out.  Quick switch to a sandwich and shared some sides with my friends: hush puppies, corn nuggets, beans & corn bread.   The beans were a strong disappointment, perhaps because that is one of my favorite parts of good old fashioned Kansas City barbecue.  Here the beans were a little too firm for my taste and the sauce was thin and not quite as flavorful as I would have liked.  The hush puppies were decent, the corn bread was moist but more in the style of a cake batter with a very small amount of cornmeal added.  The fried corn nuggets were ok. My sandwich was good and the meat was tender, though as others have commented I added quite a bit of BBQ sauce to it. One aspect I didn't care for was the \"messiness\" in the dining area.  I certainly understand that operating a high volume dining establishment is hard work, especially when the food is messy to eat, but it can be done.  After placing my order and looking for available seating, several of the spots still had used napkins or debris at the tables.  The open spot we chose had plastic utensils on the floor under the seats and the condiment bottles were messy.  I was facing the back station where customers could grab napkins or tea and the white front was covered with scuff marks and such.",

    "text": "Yes, I finally rolled in to Rollin Smoke after the many raving reviews from my Yelp Peeps.  I am super WAY over due for this joint.  I do think I have told at least 15 people about this place since our visit last Saturday.  If that doesnt say how I feel about this place, how about the leftovers that I ate for breakfast the next day.  Yes, I must say this is simply (but not simply stated) the best BBQ I have ever EVER had.  Dont let the location fool you...its part of its finger lickin good charm and you cant beat the smell of pure goodness when you pull into the parking lot.  When we first arrived a couple was leaving voicing that they will be back next year - as they come here every year when they visit Vegas.  I think that says alot too. ...a must have for tourists too?!  We both ordered the sliders-both coming with 3 and you can pick what meat you want.  I had the chicken and the brisket while my man had the chicken, brisket and the hot link sliders.  He said the hot links were his favorite-IF there could even be a favorite.  All of it was totally fab.  For sides we had the waffle fries and the mac and cheese.  The waffle fries were sprinkled with a sweet and salty flavoring that I loved and I'm still craving and wont be satisfied until I have more.  The mac and cheese was super creamy.  I thought it was very good.  Alot of the times mac comes out all dry and coagulated.  Not the case here.  I could literally eat a big bowl of it and call it a day.  ***ehem But I wouldnt recommend it only because there is SO much more important things to savor.  Lets talk about the meat - yes their slogan is that they \"rub their meat\" and however you take it consider that some good lovin (hehe).  The meat is smokey and savory....meat with FLAVOR!  The sauce was perfect (not too sweet, not too thick)-and Im very picky about sauce.   The portions were so huge.  I'm sure the guy thought I was not sure what I was getting into when I ordered the 3 sliders.  I brought home 1 1/2 that was leftover and like I said I think I must have been dreaming about it all night because I did have to dig into that first thing the next morning.  As I opened the box all I could smell was the smokey heavenly goodness and I knew right then it was going to be a good day.  So yeah on Wednesday I was sat down and asked to not be mad.....hmmm yes my man went there for lunch without me.  And YES damn right I was mad.  LOL  Yes, peeps....it is JUST THAT GOOD.  I cannot wait to go back.  Well heck Ive already checked into the catering menu so I can order for my next party.  If you are looking for a winner.....this is IT.     *side note...they are closed on Sundays.  :(",

    "text": "OK so I went to the electronics store in the same small strip mall with a friend. We decided to try out Rollin smoke. The small Asian gal that took our order did not smile, did not seem friendly, and it was only 11am so not sure why she would be so grumpy so early in the day. I had the catfish po' boy for $12.99. It comes with no sides, with nothing. The sandwich has two pieces of fried catfish, not big and not small, also lettuce, tomato and a yellow mustardy 'tartar sauce'. The fish was mushy, not sure how else to explain it. The lettuce wilty, the tomato over ripe. It also came with sliced onion. The menu does not mention the onion, had it mentioned them, I would have had them removed as I am allergic to onion. Not worth the $13. My friend had the two meat plate for $13.99. He chose the pulled pork and the chopped brisket. His also came with a side so he chose the cheesy mac n cheese. His was all good. Not a lot of meat, not sure it was worth the $13.99 but much closer to being worth the cost than the catfish sandwich was.  So to recap, do NOT get the fried catfish sandwich. Not worth it, and not that good. The onion taste on the wilty lettuce with mustard instead of real tartar sauce on mushy catfish.... the duo meat plate was not bad. And just deal with the grumpy order taker. As you can see from my reviews, I rarely give a 1 star rating... so listen to it. Better to go to the Big B's in Henderson or the John Mull's Road Kill Grill on Thom blvd in northwest Las Vegas.",

Brisket was tough.  Burnt ends were overly soggy.  Pulled pork was decent but not a wow.  Outlaw burger is huge but was dry and overly cooked.    The sides are just ok - with the onion straws being the highlight.     We did enjoy the variety of \"arkansauces\" that added significant flavor to the meats and are a recommended addition to food.",

He had listed multiple items that he wanted. I've never been there before, so I had no clue where to start, or how much to get.  I was a little nervous that I would some how mess something up.   I was greeted, and helped by the amazing catering manager Karina Litvak. She asked me a few basic questions, and knew exactly what and how much I needed.  She was so helpful, and kind she instantly lifted a weight off of my shoulders.  The kitchen staff was on top of things, and made sure everything was packed nicely.  As far as I know the food was a success!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good BBQ place with an awesome staff. Thanks again Karina! You're a gem!",

If you pick up and check your items thoroughly, you will have the pleasure of eating some of the best seasoned BBQ this town has ever offered.  This place has killer brisket (especially good sliced), phenomenal beef ribs and delicious side items that many chain restaurants don't offer.  Their salads are also unique, but ask for extra dressing; the 2 tiny containers they give you are not sufficient.  They cost a little more than average for a lunch, but the flavor and quality is worth every penny.  But be warned!  If you use Grubhub or some other delivery service your order will likely be missing items if they don't inexplicably reject the order outright the first time you attempt it.",

However, that did not hinder my expirience since the food is damn good. I will be taking my food to go until some sort of vents are installed. There are two rooms and some seating outside. It looks like a hole in a wall but those tend to have really good food. I only expirienced the first room (when you just walk in) so may be the second room does not get effected by the smoke or has vents, I would not know.  Items tried: Spare ribs, wings, chicken, the outlaw burger, waffle fries, mac n cheese, hush puppies. Favorites: Spare ribs, waffle fries (so good!). The others mentioned were pretty good too.

I shared the three meat plate with my boyfriend. It was enough for both of us, and you get 3 meats, 2 sides, 1 drink, and a roll for under $15!  Bacon potato salad was super yummy! :)  Spare ribs were my fave. Fall off the bone, tender, and sauce was great (peppery bbq sauce).   The hot link tasted like any other bbq'd hot link... Nothing special but was delish with the sauce (they cover all their meats with the same sauce I believe..)  Brisket.. My bf liked it.. But this was my least favorite. It was dry and flavorless. :(  I wouldn't recommend doing the ayce unless you can eat A LOT. because one of the meat plates is already pretty filling.",

All were delish' fall-off-the-bone good; even better with the house BBQ sauce.  Classic potato salad topped with bacon and scallion and mac & cheese were a perfect match.",

The people that work there are great and always engage in conversation, they're not just order takers.  The side of cornbread is awesome. Super moist and covered in butter. And the brisket just falls apart. I'm also a fan of hot bbq sauce, but their house sauce is great. I eat here whenever I'm in the area.   The only downfall is the service time. But I understand it's a small place with high demand so I already account for that prior to my arrival. Heard there's a second location downtown -- will be checking it out someday soon!",

You can tell they truly care about the experience and brand.  Wish we would have listened to one of the workers who said if you aren't that hungry go with the half rack (2 ribs) instead of getting the full rack that came with 4 but these ribs are the damn truth. Glad I don't live here because this place would be the death of me. The corn nuggets are a must as well if you come here. The creamy corn that is fried on the outside is killer.

This is a family owned BBQ - you'll feel like you've been welcomed in their kitchen. They are so friendly and down home. This family puts love into their food. My hubby and I have been eating here since they first opened. We have watched them expand, and expand their little store... but the quality has never suffered. They told us they still use their seasoned smoker which gives their meat it's unique tasty flavor. They have many hommade sauces too. Love ya Rollin Smoke",

    "text": "What an amazing bbq joint to stumble out in Vegas! My wife and I ordered the Pit Special because we would be able to sample 5 meats and 3 sides. It was a lot of meat.   Meats:  1. Brisket - you can choose to get it sliced or chopped. I asked for it sliced. The brisket was lean. Having been to enough bbq joints, some will ask if you prefer moist (more marbled) or lean (less fat). At many places, lean ends up tasting too dry but in this case, it was not dry at all. Just moist lean smoky meat! Very delicious! I was very impressed. This was the 2nd best brisket I've ever had. I give the brisket an A.   2. Spare ribs - these ribs weren't the type where the meat just falls off the bone. They were meaty and had great texture and the wonderful smoked bbq flavor. These also get an A.   3. Pulled pork - this was the best pull pork I've ever had. Again, it was just so moist but still maintained great flavor and texture. This gets an A+.  4. Hot links - haven't found many bbq joints do a bad job on hot links and Rollin Smoke hot links were no different. So delicious. Score: A  5. Chicken - the chicken was good but not as great as the rest of the meats. Maybe it just wasn't as good because I had already started getting full. Score: B  Sides:  1. Fried okra - highly recommended 2. Collard greens - these were really special. Most collard greens have ham in them which makes them way too salty or the greens are too soft and soggy. These weren't too salty at all. What made these collard greens so special was in place of ham, they use brisket. I've never had collard greens that had brisket in them so I didn't know what to expect, but these were amazing! A+ 3. Waffle fries - I love potatoes and have nothing negative to write about these. Crispy on the outside sprinkled generously with seasoned salt and the right texture on the inside. A  Service - amazing! My wife and I were so impressed that Dusty, one of the owners was sweeping the floors and wiping down tables while coming around to check up on every patron. Dusty is one of the nicest, most personable person I've met. In talking to him, it was obvious he takes great pride and care in making sure the bbq is world class. He could tell I appreciated great bbq so he offered my wife and I a sample of his burnt tips. Most burnt tips are exactly that - burnt. If something is burnt, it's dry and hard. Not these Rollin Smoke burnt tips. These were simply outrageously awesome - my absolute favorite item on the menu. So moist and carmelized. Highly recommend ordering these! A++++. Yeah, they are THAT good.   Next time we're in Vegas again, we'll be visiting Dusty's, Rollin Smoke! Bravo, Dusty, on a great job! Peeps, this business is worth supporting!",

It looks like the place is located in a industrial looking area. The place actually looks kinda beat up. There is parking in front . Inside the restaurant there is plenty of seating. It's park bench seating. The BBQ is very good. The meat is tender and has a lot of flavor. I've stopped by this place a few times and have never been disappointed. The SERVICE is always friendly.

We did the all you can eat and my gosh we were full after the first round but kept going. I got brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with the sweet cornbread and Mac and cheese, and oooooooowweeee it was amazing! That cornbread is like no other. I could eat that by the pound. The pulled pork had great flavor. My husband had the brisket, ribs, and catfish with a side of yams and Mac. He loved the brisket.   Our second round was when we were able to pick whatever you wanted off the menu. I got the brisket dog and some chicken wings and corn bread. My husband got the hot links, shrimp, and catfish. We were so full after it. And everything was amazing. I've never seen a concept like this. This is a keeper. Wish they had this in San Diego. We are definitely making this a must everytime we come back.",

When the Brisket is so good you don't have to add a sauce you know your in the right place! This rivals with some I have ever had, hand down. The chicken was moist and the potato salad was perfect.  On the menu, self-described \"Southern comfort food at its very best,\" based around hand-rubbed meats. Specialties include \"Pit Specials,\" of brisket, pulled pork, chicken, spare ribs and hot links, their \"Outlaw Burger,\" featuring a hamburger mix of brisket, onion and bell pepper and another local favorite, \"Smoked Meatloaf.\" I've already suggested this place to the crews at work.  I'll be back to try the rest of the menu.",

FOOD - Barbeque? mmmmmh, ok this is where it gets interesting. I admit I am a bit bias.  We are from the South and we've had amazing Barbecue in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, so we were in comparison mode, not to mention the reviews left us curious. The Ribs were cooked well but it's FLAVORLESS.  I like my Ribs dry so that was perfect but after that?? there's no Taste. It's Bland. The Mac&cheese was too al dente.... needed to be cooked maybe 2 minutes more. The Brisket were cooked perfect but again.. NO TASTE.. the meats are bland. I guess if you haven't tried other BBQ joints, you'll say this is a good spot but we beg to differ. This is what we call FIRST and LAST!",

Contemplated on the all you can eat but decided to share the Pit Special with my friend. This was plenty enough food for the two of us especially when you get three sides on top of the meats. We got the loaded mash, Mac and cheese, and the corn bread. Everything was really good, my favorite meat was the brisket it was nice and juicy and the spicy bbq balances it out well.   I also got the banana pudding and the meatloaf to go. Both were really good and I'm sure if I didn't wait 6 hours to eat the meatloaf it would have been stupendous.  Will definitely try to come here again.",

I was super happy when the stars aligned and we got Jessie and her hubby Bill, Dyanna and her man Brent and Joel and I all in one place for dinner. This was also Jessie's and Bill's first time as well as ours.   It was a Saturday night so it was busy. It's the kinda spot you order first and then you find seating. Joel ordered the famous Outlaw burger and I got the Triple meat with brisket, ribs, and hot links my side was potato salad and Joel's side was Mac & cheese. We totally lucked out and scored a large table big enough for all of us. It seemed like we just sat down and our names were called and out came the order. Wow! Joel's burger was huge! Like so big he didn't know how to start on it. He enjoyed it a lot. The Mac & cheese was ok nothing special. I really liked my brisket and hot links. The meat was tasty and tender. I was disappointed that the ribs were tough. Because I expected fall off the bone tender. Not a big fan of Rollin' Smokes sauce either. I prefer a thicker sauce. I did enjoy the potato salad and it reminded me a lot of what I make at home. Joel also used the Yelp check in offer for a free dessert. He choose the banana pudding which he loved.   The atmosphere was bare, but had picnic tables and TVs. The dining area is split into two rooms. Because the turn over is so quick the tables tend to get dirty which is the downside. The staff was friendly, but since they were super busy they might have needed more people.   The food didn't blow me away, but it was good. I want to go back again to try some other things on the menu. Plus, they did have excellent pickles!!! What a fun night! Glad to be able to check Rollin Smoke off my Yelp bookmarks list!",

I ordered 2 Pit Specials to go and just sat and breathed in the delicious smells that envelop the entire business, inside and out. It was heavenly.   The Pit Special consists of 4 meats and 3 sides. We got the brisket, pulled pork, 1/4 chicken and 2 spare ribs with kickin beans, bacon potato salad and onion straws with one order and cole slaw substituting the onion straws on another. I had to go up and place an additional order of corn bread, banana pudding and blueberry cobbler because the longer I stared at the menu, the more I wanted to try.  The portions were generous and each Pit Special fed 2 of us. The meat was awesome! All of it! I loved the chicken and ribs. Juicy, smoky, perfect. The sides were all delicious. The beans were a little too peppery for me but still a great flavor and the cole slaw & bacon potato salad were quickly inhaled. Oh and the BBQ sauce was sweet and also perfect.  We stuffed ourselves.  The staff were friendly, courteous and it was apparent that they loved their jobs. I see no reason to ever go to another BBQ joint in this town. Nothing else compares and I can't wait to try their many other offerings.",

There was no smoke flavor and I swear folks think bacon makes everything better. Well it needs to start out decent to be made better by bacon. Bland potato salad with bacon, still bland potato salad.  The rib tips had to be a day or two old. The beef ribs were way over cooked. And the sauce exploding on my husband's shirt was the icing on the cake.  The 5 stars are for the chef offering to fix the situation and giving us fresh food. The first impression is a lasting impression. But the fact that they were really nice made it better. I may give it another try. I've heard good things about this place.  Maybe we just came on the wrong day.",

I ordered the 5 meat combo so that I could taste a good sampling.  Food arrived fast but it was clear that most if not all of it had set there in a steam plate for many hours.  Without sauce, all tasted bland and stale.  The sausage link was both dry and others while not try, clearly had that watery taste.  Ribs were decent but just like pulled pork was not edible without the sauce.  I could tell this food could be better if it were fresh but I have to rate what I ate and that was very disappointing.  I had three sides: 1. ColeSlaw.  I love coleslaw to cool my mouth between bites.  This one seemed fresh and nice but had a strong mexican flavor which ruined the experience.  This is a personal judgement of course.  The beans were both a little too spicy and sweet.  Again, I can see others liking it.  Last was waffle fries.  I liked these very much even though they too were not very fresh.  I also had a couple of rolls and these were excellent.  Nice, soft and fresh!  Back to the sauce, it had a magical ability to make the stale meats tasted decent.  Without it I would have walked out with one bite.  It is rather thin, medium spicy and sweet (this was the \"American Sauce\").  On the atmosphere, the place had a rather unpleasant smell to it.  While visually clean, it made you think it was not.  Anyway, disappointed after spending $36 for dinner for one.",

    "text": "Delicious!! Got a bunch of yummy things from them including their hot dog, corn nuggets, greens, ribs, brisket and more! The bbq is made to order so it takes longer, but not quite as long as some places like Lucille's. The greens were good, but not as creamy or good as John Mull's Roadkill grill. They have a bunch of sauces but they are all pretty liquid and didn't seem to have much distinguishing tastes from one to the other. Their prices are decent for be and overall it was extremely delicious and satisfying. Even though John Mull's is further away, I think I prefer their style of bbq (dryer).",

They also make a whole ton of sauces for you to try but our fav was the arkansauce. From sweet to spicy they have you covered though, just make sure to order the super hot one at the counter. You can also swap out meats on the combo platter so we opted for burnt ends over the sausages and man oh man what a good choice! The pulled pork was excellent and the ribs just came right off the bone. I have to say I wish they were in NYC!!",

    "text": "Delicious BBQ. Fresh and tender meats. I bought the five meats plate and loved every bite EXCEPT for the link because it had Anise spices in it (anise is what gives black licorice its flavor and I'm not a fan of black licorice) others enjoyed the link though so maybe it was just me. The sauce is ok but honestly you don't need anything with these meats they are literally smoked to perfection and seasoned proper. The owner chef Tim (if I remember correctly) was very kind and was constantly making sure everyone was taken care of.   My only problem is that I wish this place was bigger and had ac. It's a tough road eating BBQ and sweating in an establishment :/ but honestly the food was so good no one even complained.   In the future when I do come back to Vegas I hope to grab some Rollin' smokes, but next time I'll be ordering to go! :)",

The portion sizes are HUGE and allow plenty of leftovers (which I'm super happy about--lunch the next day?  Yes, please!). The pulled pork is some of the best I've tasted.  Each bite was extremely tasty and cooked perfectly.  When you pair that with baked beans on a bed of waffle fries and then smother it in cheese, you have a meal like no other!!!  The line was long which tells you the food is amazing, but we got through it pretty quickly and our food came out right away.  If you are looking for great BBQ, RUN to Rollin' Smoke!!!",

    "text": "Searching Nearby Me on Yelp landed me here.  I was here on a Saturday night after running the RNR LV 5K.  The place is hidden at night.  It is located on a shady looking street near an overpass.  Get your GPS ready or you will miss it.  The parking is pretty small so you may not be able to find parking but there is also street parking.  There are tables outside in the patio but there are a number of tables inside as well.  You order by lining up on the right and then grabbing a table where the servers will bring you the platters of food.  For the five of us, we got the The Pit Special and the Ribs Platter.  It was more than enough food for us.  The best items in the meals were the sides.  The meats themselves were a bit dry (mainly the ribs) so I focused my eyes on the sides.  Of all the sides, I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the corn nuggets.  A must get when you are there.  Of the meats, even though most were dry, I liked the brisket and the baby-back ribs.  There were a couple types of sauces near the drink counter (honey mustard and a vinegar sauce).  Also on the table was a barbeque-like sauce.  But even with the sauces, the meats were still dry...  Such a bummer but I would still give this place another try.  I noticed the table next to us ordering a huge burger that was stacked like 6 inches high.  Crazy fatty goodness I bet and I wish because that is what I'm going to be grabbing when I come again.",

My friend suggested this place called - \"Rollin Smoke Barbeque\" so we flipped on our GPS and headed to the back roads to a seedy part of town (where there were a lot of strip clubs, bars, & adult book stores).........but then when we finally found this place and walked in............ I was in Ba Ba Barbeque heaven!!!!  The restaurant was really packed, and as we walked to the counter, the friendly clerk took our orders. After you order your food, you find an open table (good luck), and when your food is ready, they will bring your order out to you.  There is a Sauce station within the restaurant where you can get additional BBQ sauce. I want to point out.........try the \"Mama Sweet\" BBQ sauce! It was bomb @ss good! My friend liked this BBQ sauce so much, I actually saw him put it in a little cup & drink the sauce! That's how much he loved the BBQ sauce!  Before you sit down at your table, you will also have to get your own plastic eating utensils, napkins, as well as your own drinks, as the soda fountain within the restaurant was self serve.  For my meal that night, I ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\" - where I picked the following - Brisket, 1/4 Chicken, & 2 Spare Ribs. ($17.99)  One of my friends also ordered the \"Trio Choice of Meats\"  - where he picked the Brisket, 2 Spare Ribs, & Hot Links. ($17.99)  And my other friend ordered the \"Duo Choice Of 2 Meats\" - where he picked the Brisket, & Pulled Pork. ($13.99)  With our meals came with a side, and I ended up taking the corn bread. All of our meals came with collard greens, and the collard greens had some kind of smoked meat mixed inside.  What can I say about the grub?  I totally loved the BBQ Chicken! The chicken meat was all so soft, and the meal literally fell off the bone.......nice smokey flavor too!  The spare ribs was also delicious, and I just loved how the meat came off of the bone so easily! I really loved how soft the BBQ ribs were.......  As for the brisket.........it was just okay for me. Loved the smokey flavor, but I gotta tell you the brisket wasn't very soft. I've had better tasting brisket on Oahu.......from \"Verde\" in Kaimuki.  Overall a pretty good barbeque joint! No frills..........kinda of place, and they definitely churn out some pretty great barbeque meats!   Be careful of your surroundings when coming here........if I was with my girlfriend, I'd probably pass on this place.........my friend also mentioned to me that if he was here with his wife & kids, he'd probably do the same.",

    "text": "Rollin smoke is as close to southern smoke as you will get west of the Colorado River.  Let's get to the good stuff  Meats  Spare Ribs: The highlight of the meal. If you're evenly in love with spare ribs as much as you are with baby back ribs, then I suggest to just go with these. Teeeender *TJ Detweiler voice* added with the taste of the meat will make you laugh at your visits to Bludso's or Phil's. 4.5/5  Baby Ribs: I want my baby back baby back baby back..these were less impressionable, maybe because I had them second? But don't get me wrong they were still very good! Fall off the bone and tasty but your stomach will tell you it was only a fair investment and you should of \"spared\" it some space. 4/5  Hot Links: The perfect meat side for my rib meal, yes I get meats as a side to my meat. The taste wasn't as \"hot\" as you would think, then again my mom raised me with a molcajete. Tasty to dip in your favorite sauce. 4/5  Sauces..Ask them for a sample tasting of them before you make a decision of such high importance  Sides   Corn Bread: My relationship with corn bread has always been 50/50. I approve of this one. Soft at the bite, taste home made, the style of it was made to be had with this meal. 4/5  BBQ Beans: These are my babies when it comes to BBQ meals, there was a hint of flavor that elevated it past average but nothing that I'd recommend in bold if you're not such a fan of beans to begin with. 3.7/5  Waffle Fries: The side I dipped in the least. Missing a good seasoning, lacked a crisp taste. 2/5  Potato Salad: In a league of it's own. Someone was a side hog with this one but the 2 spoons of it were very good. Hard to break down the flavor but Javier approved. 4.25/5  Dessert:  Banana Pudding: I'm so sad I was too full to indulge in this the way my inner child would have liked. But this swirled me back to my cubbie days when I thought snack packs were the bomb. The nilla cookies added to this only makes it sound that much better, right? And that's because it is. 4.5/5  Woah, looks like I guinea pigged it for you.  This all was not a bad price either, considering Vegas is Vegas. It was $40 something, The only downward arrow is that the sides are uber small, meaning it's a portion for one. Order 2 of the ones you think you may like the most if you're meal sharing.       Service:  This was a to go order. It was ready in the said time, they sent me off with sample tastings of their sauces, their customer service enthusiasm was meh. I'd say they're their BBQ beans equivalent in this department. 3.7/5  My Final Say  We all know somewhere in Kansas City or Austin there lays an establishment that is probably better than Rollin Smoke, but regionally speaking, I have not met a close competitor to this place in the West. Let that serve as my 5 star justification.   I recommend coming here, unless you're a part of Hank Hill's blood line, I am sure you will be satisfied with your meal here.  To Whom It May Concern  I apologize for lack of pictures, I turned into Joey Chestnut one bite in and forgot to take more.",

I ordered the rib plate, which was supposed to be 3 baby backs, 2 spares and a giant beef rib. I don't know if I got lucky or not, but I got 4 back backs, 3 spares and the beef. They were all delicious.   The beef rib was the highlight, as it had a brilliant salty crust that packed in the flavor. The baby backs had a brilliant smoke ring and were tender but not falling off the bone. The spare ribs brought up the rear, but they were still quite good.   And the cornbread... word to the wise: Get. The. Cornbread.  Overall this was a great experience and I'd be back in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "OMG I followed the scent of smoked flesh all the way from the airport. My rental guided me down the strip and turned left at TRUMP Hotel and crossed under freeway till I land in the industrial dump of parking lot. But when you want the best BBQ who cares about its surroundings.   Now I had this place on my radar for sometime and finally manned up and went. BBQ so damn good make you wanna slap your own face. I'd say the best BBQ on the West Coast and defiantly in Vegas. I've had BBQ all over the country however the  BBQ meatloaf is flipping sensational. In all my barbecue eating sessions I had never encountered BBQ meatloaf and it didn't fail my tastebuds. Meatloaf set on mash potatoes and sauce plus a stack of shredded deep fried onions for crunch and scallions for extra flavor.  I've been back and had the ribs which are nice and meaty with perfect smoke rings. No sauce needed on them cause there amazing and very tasty. Also the hot links hold there own with a nice kick to them and condiments of Mac Cheese made your meal. It's a perfect side dish here cause it's not creamy or watery but cooked just like mom makes.   I've got a wish list of items to order so I'll be making pit stop soon. FRANK gives a double thumbs up for Rollin Smoke BBQ, so put this on your list of culinary needs to consume.",

The sides (beans, mac & cheese, greens) were cooked perfectly with a southern flare. The sweet tea was oh so yummy. I didn't have a dessert, but I will next time. The service was fast and with a smile. The only thing that bothered me was the place was very smokey (the smell). It was a good thing, but it lingered in my clothes after I left.

I guess I should have tried the beef ribs because the brisket I had was overcooked, dry and tough, the pulled pork wasn't tender enough, and you can't order baby back ribs with the combos, only St. Louis.  I had a couple of those and they were OK, just extra fatty.  Overall, I was disappointed because I'm a BBQ aficionado due to my multiple trips to Texas every year.    I like BBQ so much I bought a Texas-style smoker with a side firebox and spent a few years perfecting my 'Q smoking skills.  I can do a brisket and pulled pork that are miles ahead of what we got here and my baby backs are killer.  I don't know, maybe it was too late in the day, we got there about 7 PM and despite what it says in the listing, they close at 8 on weekdays.  The pit master, who seems to be a very nice guy and is very friendly, brought a bunch of briskets in that had just come out of the smoker and maybe we got the tail end of the last batch.  Even if that was the case however; what we got shouldn't have been served in my opinion, it was that bad.",

And they need to send someone out regularly to wipe them down. We had combo ribs plate $17.99 with Mac and cheese side, also a trio meat with 2 x's brisket and spare ribs $14.00 with beans. Ordered a Full slab of Baby backs to go $28.00 It said that every plate came with a dinner roll and a drink. They didn't put the roll on. I questioned the guys delivering  the food they said \"no\" it doesnt. I re read the board and ask the girl at the register she says \"yes\". When they deliver the rolls the explanation is that there is a menu change coming. OK I get that. Use a piece of tape and cover the roll if your not giving it out anymore. Here's my advice. You charge alot for the food don't be short sighted. The roll is pennies on each plate. I and many others ( long line behind and in front of me) do not mind paying prices if the food is good. Give something away on the plate (roll). One of the guys tried to sell me that the slice of bread that my food was on was the roll? Look down the road at longevity and you will see if you penny pick people no matter how good the food is we won't come back.  I again will say some of the best BBQ I have had hands down but they have some kinks to work out.",

The Bad: Sauce is way too spicy for kids , Mac and cheese is too spicy ,and  brisket was alright nothing to write about. Ordering is confusing and wasn't sure if u seat yourself or wait to be seated , small location , and not a fan of the location                   Tips: if u don't like spicy food u will not enjoy this , limited items for kids to consume , and they are closed Sunday",

I don't know how people were even sitting in there eating.  We sat outside.  Between us, we had two Trio and one Duo Plates plus drinks = $63.75.  Little pricey for what you get.  There are other BBQ locations that will give you two sides, corn, and muffin with a combo plate like these.  Rollin only give you one side.  Everything else costs extra.  The Trios were both cold.  Yes the meats were cold to slightly warm.  The one side however was steaming hot.  The taste was again just so so.  One in our party is from AR, and he said other BBQ spots in Vegas are better.  Well I agree again.  There will be no 3 strikes and your out here for me, as I will NOT be back nor recommend.",

    "text": "Look, I'm Texan.  I've grown up around barbecue.  And I've found that the West Coast didn't have much in the way of barbecue when I was living in SoCal (correct me if I'm wrong, I take suggestions).  And while I like Lucille's here, that's more Cajun than the stuff I grew up with.  On a whim, we found this place.  It's in the middle of nowhere, in an area you probably wouldn't venture to, in a tiny shopping center that you wouldn't notice.  But you'll notice that smell when you step out of the car.  And I mean BAM!  Once that scent hit my nose, I had to know more.  Also, not Texas based, I will graciously concede that Arkansas knows their stuff, and this place knows their stuff.  The staff is nice, and one look at them told me these people weren't anything but legit.  I liked the cook immediately.  We ordered a rib combo plate, and let the dining begin.  It was so good.  Nice and spicy, meat falling off the bone, a big squirt bottle of sauce on the table, I ate and ate and ate, and then I got kind of woozy, and asked for a \"to go\".  I moaned all the way home.  Partly because I was full, yes, but partly because this place hit the sweet spot of barbecue goodness.  I went for my leftovers, and shredded bones like a barbarian.  I regret nothing.  Will I go back?  Absolutely.  Small, subtle, out of the way, but so worth it when it came to dining options, friendly people, fast service, and quality of food.  They have something called a \"BBQ Sundae\".  That sounds intriguing, and I wish to know more.",

    "text": "Went to check out Rollin Smoke on Saturday around 7.  The line was out the door!  My husband got in line while I went in search for a table. They have picnic tables in the area you order, a dining room connected, and then a completely separate room with some more picnic tables. Oh a few tables outside too. So I found a table in the dining room, which I shared with some people I didn't know, but none of us minded.  We ordered brisket, pork, and chicken. For our sides we got waffle fries and loaded mash. Everything was delicious. Pork was so tender and juicy. Brisket was tender and was cooked perfectly. I didn't eat the chicken but my husband said it was really good. Everything had wonderful flavor. I like that they didn't drench it in BBQ sauce. There is sauce on all the tables so you can drench it if you want. The brisket came on a really soft piece of white bread. The sides were hot and delicious.  We also ordered the peach cobbler a la mode and it was ok. I would say it was my least favorite thing. It just didn't stand out to me, but it wasn't bad. I just didn't love.  We Really enjoyed eating here and are definitely coming back!  The staff was very nice. They all had smiles on their faces even though they were slammed",

Usually a high rating place on Yelp can be suggestive, but the reviews truly do not lie.   Southern True cooked Mesquite BBQ is what this place is all about and when we got there they had a line a mike long going outside.  That can only suggest one thing: the food is excellent.  I was fortunate enough to be able to try the ribs, brisket, and corn taters.  All were very delicious and food came out very fast.  My only little quirk was the menu was too far away from the register to place your order and there was only one register for the long line.  Seating was very limited and the location is an off the wall spot, but that's kind of it's hidden gem.  I loved the fact I left the joint smelling like Mesquite BBQ and that smell is very delightful.  When I got back to my office, everyone asked me where I went, because they could smell the BBQ smell.  Go see for yourself and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Being the owner of two Big Green Eggs, I usually make these meats at home, but seeing it is summer here (enough said), it is really nice to be able to go out for this instead of doing it myself all day.   Hubby had the outlaw burger and I shared my meat plate with him. We also had sides of mac and cheese, yams and corn nuggets.  First off, hubby loved his burger.  I had one bite and it was good, but too much like meatloaf for me both in taste and texture.  I like that they smoked the burger. We do that at home as well and there is nothing better.  Next visit hubby is getting the meatloaf he said. Something about loaded mashed potatoes.......yum.  I really enjoyed the brisket, it was moist and had just the right amount of smoke infused into it.  Some of it was cut too thick for my liking and as such, didn't have that tug and pull apart you expect, but thankfully, it wasn't served drenched in sauce, that is a no-no in my book.    The pulled pork was good, but not great. It lacked that smoky flavor but it was very moist.  I have the same problem making this at home. It is difficult to get that smoke all the way into the deepest part of the meat.  Their BBQ sauce was very nice, not too sweet or just tasting like spiced-up ketchup. The two together were nice and next time on a sandwich it is.  The chicken was also good, but my favorite for flavor was the homemade sausage. It was nice and smokey and had a great kick at the end.  I would like the grind a bit finer though.  The sides were all tasty.  You could taste the cheese in the mac and cheese and it was not greasy at all. The yams were nice and chunky and sweet but not too sweet. The corn nuggets were perfect, nice and crunchy on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. H&J on Eastern, take some lessons from this place on how to cook these.   We shared a banana pudding for dessert and it was creamy good, but I would have liked to see some banana slices in it. The vanilla wafers were nice and soaked with pudding goodness.  I am not sure how we had room to eat it all, but we did.  We took plenty of meat home for leftovers.    Will we be back? Yes, of course.  This is by far the best BBQ we have had in Las Vegas so far.  Just wish they were closer to home.",

It came on mashed potatoes with home made French onions on top ... Besides the food the customer service was fantastic ... Our waiters name was Mitch he made our expierience fun and made sure we tried all the best items...

    "text": "When you see a big ole pickup side by side a just off the lot Mercedes in the parking lot of a way off the strip business/industrial section of town with one restaurant in sight, you know that's a good place to eat!  It's a humble and simple setup when you walk through the doors but the flavors roam about the air which play a prelude to bounty in which you're about to partake. The wall sized menu is easy to follow and offers a whole lot to choose from. This being my first visit, I had to take a while before deciding but everyone does that it seems. The line gets long and for good reason. If you get there after 11:15, expect to standing outside those doors leading in. There's ample seating on a sunny day or dry evening. The weather is perfect for both for now. All tables have unlimited napkins, ketchup and BBQ sauce. The people are very friendly and check in on you every 30 minutes or so to make sure you're enjoying your food. Indoors is splint into two eating areas. One is the room you come into to order with picnic benches set up and various displays all around the room including the giant sized menu. The other has a couple of flat screens going with a game or two on broadcast.  The food was savory and very tasty! We had a hot dog, the Duo which is a two meat order and a Trio a three meat order consisting of brisket, pork ribs and hot links. Other choices we could have had were a 14 chicken and pork. Our sides were waffle fries and mashed potatoes. The hot dog was meaty with good chew and snap when you bit in. The fries rounded out the intake quite nicely, not too oily and plentiful. The hot links are sneaky spicy as they invade your palette bite after bite. So good! The brisket was tender and cut right. I needed extra sauce because that's what I like. The ribs were killer! Lots of meat on those bones, tender but held good form after the bite. Those were sucked dry. The mashed potatoes garnished with fresh bacon bits and melted cheese were thick, rich and flavorful. I could eat that all day! Unlimited drinks and BBQ sauce are always a plus.   What's my bottom line? I have a saying about restaurants: You get one shot at the title; if you succeed, you'll get more shots at the championship! So yeah, I'm coming back! There's so much still to try and this initial visit definitely left a strong, positive impression. Great prices, championship quality BBQ. My actual rating is a 4.7 stars...",

I'm a southern barbecue connoisseur, raised on Deep South barbecue and refined by years of living in Nashville, which excels in perfect barbecue.   So, at a new barbecue place, I'll always test the pulled pork sandwich.  The True southern test is if the sandwich comes with coleslaw on top of the pork in the sandwich. This place didn't do this! But, upon request, they did add it - but a star is removed for not making this standard. People can't experience a real pulled pork sandwich w/o coleslaw on top.   Overall, the pulled pork has a great smoky flavor with the required tenderness and no stringiness. Some 'ends' were included - the charred, chewy ends, which is exactly right. The coleslaw was also excellent, as was the standard sauce.  I also had a side of potato salad. I'll admit that there are many types of potato salad, none of which can compare to my mother's, but this potato salad was really, really good.    Next visit requires a taste of the ribs. I hear they are excellent.    You can't go wrong here, if you're looking for authentic southern barbecue.",

My friends that live here have now found their barbecue spot.  THANKS TO ME!  Wink   It's a cute and cozy spot hidden in a somewhat shopping center.

We wanted to branch out for a new lunch spot--something that wasn't on the strip or in our hotel. I Yelped \"lunch\" and Rollin Smoke was one of the first places to pop up. So me, my girlfriend and my sister piled into an Uber and set out for some bbq.   The menu can be a bit overwhelming with all of the different meats and combinations. I wanted to sample a little bit of it all, so I opted for the 5 meat platter: pulled pork; brisket; hot link; chicken; spare ribs. Everything was really good and unlike some other Yelpers, my chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender. I love seeing that tasty smoke ring on the ribs and the meat melted in my mouth. The sauce selection was great and I really like that they allow you to sauce the meat yourself. Nothing worse than bad bbq being covered up by an abundance of sauce.   With the 5 meat platter you are given a choice of 3 sides...I opted for the baked beans; collards and mac and cheese. All were very good and the bits of pork found in the collards added flavor and were a nice touch. The mac and cheese was gooey and had that homemade feel.   Also, the service was great. The employees at the counter were helpful and it seemed like every few minutes a staff member would come into the room we were dining in to make sure everybody was enjoying their food. We were fortunate to not have a line when we came here but while dining, the place quickly filled up.",

After a few write-ups in local publications to recently receiving National recognition as one of the top 25 BBQ spots in the country, that is quite an achievement from John, Dusty, Tim, and Mayra and they have single handedly put Las Vegas, Nevada on the Barbecue map!  We dropped by for some True Southern Q before going to see Pin-Up at The Stratosphere. Right away, Dusty suggests the Smoked Meatloaf which has become one of their regular items on their updated and expanded menu of deliciousness. We also got the Seafood Platter with Fried Catfish, Fried Shrimp, Hush Puppies and Fried Okra which they were out of, so one of the cooks suggested the Corn Fritters, and those did not disappoint! Seasoned well and the sweet creaminess of the corn was very tasty!  This huge slab of meaty goodness arrives on top a bed of loaded mashed potatoes, and sweet crispy onions with a sweet BBQ sauce and is one of  the tastiest renditions of an American classic that I've come across! The seafood platter is served with lemon, hot sauce, and tartar sauce was equally delicious. The Shrimp had a crisp outside while still keeping that plump, juicy interior, The Catfish was nice, crisp and flaky, and I'm no hush puppy expert but I thought those were just okay.  If you're still in search of some killer barbecue, you may want to bookmark Rollin' Smoke, it may just become one of your  favorite spots! ALOHA!!!",

Since moving to Vegas I wanted to find a good BBQ place and just haven't found it.  My boyfriend and I got the 3 meat platter. Beef brisket, burnt ends and pork. My boyfriend said he really didn't care for the beef brisket. The burnt ends were over seasoned. The pork was just a huge clump of plain pork which I had to add a decent amount of sauce to. Sides: mashed potatoes and corn bites. I'll be honest...I swear the mashed potatoes were those Betty crocker bagged dry potatoes with stuff added. It was weird. They tasted flavorful but fake. The corn bites were decent hot but once at room temp they were blah.  We spent about $25 on this meal which is a little expensive. We did get a lot of meat but it just overall was not great.   Sad to say, I'm still on the hunt for a decent BBQ place out here.",

However, If you have actually had real quality bbq from real southern places, you will find this place BLEH.   The pulled pork - flavorless without sauce, bland burnt ends - overly fatty, dry, chunks, potent smoke flavor macaroni and cheese - over cooked pasta, cheese sauce?, bland coleslaw - disgusting, not one redeeming thing about it. brisket - good baked beans - good",

This place would be right at home back in the South. The ribs were smoked just right and were excellent but weren't fall off the bone tender. The chopped brisket was lean and tender with a little bit of a peppery flavor. I was happy to see they have fried okra and it was just right. The beans were tasty as well and have a peppery flavor that's kinda unique and i haven't seen that before. The tea is the real thing and goes perfectly with a BBQ meal. Portions are HUGE and I was barely able to finish my meal. I'll be back here and it's a must try for BBQ fans in Vegas.",

Proximity search brought this place to the top of the list and I headed over.  From the outside, the place looks like a real hole in the wall, which it is...this place has soul.  Before you even walk through the doors, the aroma of smoked meats sets forth the salivary glands into full production.  I ordered the Trio plate with pulled pork, spare ribs and brisket with a side of hush puppies.  For the money, the volume of food is a very good value.  I managed to eat about 3/4 of the plate and the leftovers easily comprised a separate meal.   The flavor of the meat was delicious and the sauce complemented the meal perfectly.  Even the hush puppies had a nice underlying spice to them that was quite addicting.  Something as simple as properly seasoning hush puppies tells me there is attention to detail here.   Good food can get you four stars but its the staff that pushed it to five for me.  They were incredibly friendly and upbeat.  You can tell when a place is well-run by just listening to how they interact with each other.  It was clear that this staff really cares about what they do and have a passion for their craft.  Thanks for a great meal!",

So gave it a try and got the Biggin' sandwich which is a combo of their brisket, pulled pork and hot link all on the same bun.  The bun, is great. Soft and soppy.  The meat, 2 out of 3 were outstanding.  The hot links are great and made in house.  The pulled pork was as good as I've had in Vegas. Didn't care as much for the brisket.  I didn't hate it and it was tender, but it just didn't hold up flavor wise to the other meats.    Their Mac n cheese side was solid as was their peach cobbler.  Def gonna come back and work on some more menu items. So far this is the best BBQ in town.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas April 2013 and did a random Yelp search for some BBQ.  This place had high marks and they weren't too far off the strip.  I even feel badly about the low rating that I am leaving, because so many others were so good.  But this is our truth...  We walked into the place and the smell of smoke was potent and we were really eager to try a little of everything.  We ordered a sampler and because we \"checked in\" there we got a free dessert.  The meal was a HUGE disappointment!  What a shame.  We have strong roots in the south and this did not do it any justice.    The chicken was flavorless.  The ribs had smokey flavor, but was borderline jerky!  The pulled pork was sub-par.  The sides were also a disaster.  The beans were hard and way too spicy, just underdeveloped flavor.  The mac and cheese was a mushy blob of fake-tasting cheese, just not good!  The bread they served was hard and cold.  I would have paid them extra NOT to bring the so called dessert to the table.  That was the poorest excuse for peach cobbler.  Marie Calender's from the local grocery store would have been way better.  The banana pudding was baby food grade, and gritty, just not right!    Maybe we went at the wrong time of day (dinner time on a Tuesday night)?  Perhaps it would have been better at lunch time or on a Friday/Saturday night?  Maybe, if we're desperate, we might try again on a more popular night?    I think the guys are trying hard, because the service was pretty good and hospitable (hence the 1 star).  For us, the service was the only bright spot.  We left a lot of the food picked over and with our pockets $30 lighter.  The waiter came over to the table with a big smile and said \"Ain't it good?\"  We just didn't have the heart to break it down for him.  It is terrible when you pay for food and it doesn't meet your expectations and you leave hungry...what a waste of time and money :-(",

    "text": "Ok this place is off the hook! Ate there last Tuesday April 15th, had the Outlaw burger and Mac and cheese, the wife had the brisket, chicken and pork baby backs. These guys know how to smoke meat, the bark is awesome and the smoke ring is perfect! The Outlaw burger is EPIC, it's made with their smoked brisket and is about 6\" tall when served, good luck getting this in your mouth. The wife's ribs were cooked perfectly to competition standards and man what a flavor.   We had to go back for round 2 and hit the place up on Saturday April 19th. This time I got the smoked meat loaf and a hot link, the wife got 3 types of ribs, the pork, the baby back and the beef rib. The meat loaf was the best I have ever had, smoked meat loaf is the the only way to make meat loaf, I can't wait to try it in my smoker! The wife's pork ribs were perfect again, but wait the beef rib is the bell ringer! This thing is actually prime rib on a stick (rib) it's about 3\" thick and done perfectly, the smoke ring, bark and flavor are the radical, this is smoked prime rib at its finest. My only dig would be the hot link wasn't cooked enough (luke warm), but the flavor was great. We will be back, every time we are in Vegas, I can't wait!!  On another note you'll be safe at this place, every cop in town eats there. 3 squad cars were in the parking lot when we pulled up and then 3 more showed up when we were eating. I don't know who was covering the streets of Vegas, but they were all eating well! I had to have the tee shirt, way to go Rollin smoke!",

There is usually a line to wait in to order your food from a guy sitting at a podium like a judge in court.  The prices are very high.  I ordered a half rack of St. Louis ribs, a half rack of Baby back ribs, Half pound of burnt ends, and a soda.  This came with two sides so i chose mac n cheese and coleslaw.  I paid $50.  WTF...?    The ribs were awesome but the burnt ends were almost all fat and not burnt.  The mac  n cheese was something like what u get at a bad diner.  Coleslaw...meh.  Soda was great.  lol  I assume a probably wont be back as its a pain to get there and costly.  I can eat at other rib places and get more bang for my buck IMO.",

I had a Lehigh Valley IronPigs hat on, displaying a pig, and the order taker took a liking to it. I went with the brisket sandwich combo and ordered cole slaw (not the jalepeno cole slaw this time) as my side.  Quite promptly my sandwich was delivered by one of the staff. Overflowing with tasty shredded brisket. The cole slaw was a nice compliment. I left stuffed.  The place has a casual atmosphere, couples, buddies, and families.

There does not seem to be a distinguishing of take away orders vs table service, so expect to wait.  The only area in which to do so is a service station and I had to keep moving about.  The pulled pork was worth the travel and wait time.  The meat is tender but holds together.  It has an intense smoke flavor and mild flavorful sauce.

The Aroma of smoked meat somewhere in the back..I've been hearing about this place for awhile and well since I live in Henderson it's kinda far but I had a chance this time and I was in for a treat...              I wasn't sure what to order.... oh wait yeah I was, Beef Ribs but I wanted like a combo so I got the babyback/ St. Louis/  Beef Rib combo with a side of bacon potato salad all for about $24 bucks. Holy smokes it was worth every penny. This was one of the best char and flavor. The meat was hot juicy exactly what I was looking for...      Now on to the Beef Rib..I believe that you are not a BBQ place if you don't cook Beef Ribs, that's my opinion anyway. So I'm thinking let's go cause right at this moment for me Phil's BBQ Beef Rib was the bar for me and whelp no longer. I have a new bar and it's no longer in San Diego. Rolling Smoke you killed it! I mean the best. I'm gonna have dreams about this! I pray if I may that you open in Henderson..I'm fan and will continue to come back as long as you have Beef Ribs..Thanks Guys you rock \\m/",

That being said it doesn't quite compare with the likes of Oklahoma Joe's in KC and a few places in Texas, etc.    I really enjoyed this place.  It felt like a barbeque joint should feel.  It had the picnic tables, it had the great hog's head, it even had a line going out the door, which is a good sign.   I took advantage of the all you can eat, so that I could sample a little bit of everything.  The catfish was divine.  The meat was excellent and so was the sauce.    If you get a craving for bbq in Vegas, this is the place.",

    "text": "The husband and I come to Vegas at least once if not more times a year. We are foodies and have had amazing meals here at 5 star lux restaurants. Last time we were in Vegas we wanted to try something different: \"cheaper\" eats, just to shake it up. It was fun and we ended up at Rolling Smoke as a result.  Now, here is the thing: this place gave me the best \"bite\" of food I've ever had in all of Vegas. Tied with $500 chef tasting menu meals at Andre's. I kid you not. The \"world famous beef rib\" was that amazing. It reminded me of the Flintstones brontosaurus chops it was so big. Husband and I split it and it was so good I was tempted to fork fight him for it. It was lucious.  I don't actually remember anything much else. The sides, the other meats (we got a 3 meat platter and upgraded for 6 bucks to a beef rib with it per Yelp recommendations) and the service were just a bit above average, I recall. There was something I vaguely recall about a charge for sauce or something that was irritating but beyond that all I recall was that rib and my mouth waters just thinking about it. So I am rating the rib 5 stars and the rest about 3.5 and that brings us to 4.   We're going back in February so I'll update again after.",

Thank you Rollin Smoke for filling that gap! Their sauces are gluten free and the pit master / staff there will guide you through which sides are gluten free too.  Located in an industrial-ish area, yet close to Arts District, Rollin Smoke offers some really nice meats. We always opt for the Rib Platter Special with an extra Beef Rib. Oh my gollys, that beef rib.  Can't describe it without salivating so much!  Now on our last trip there, the pork spare ribs were on the dry side. Nothing that a dousing of sauce could fix, but hopefully they make it better next time.  PS If you're a local, just drive here rather than their location at the Pawn Plaza. Much better experience.",

Speaking of Flintstones they also have these huge smoked turkey legs.  My favorite is definitely their smoked meatloaf topped with BBQ sauce and fried onion strings over some rib sticking (no pun intended) mash potatoes. And  if that were not enough a side of their corn fritters dusted with magic.    Not in the mood for meatloaf, try their famous \"Outlaw Burger\" and try to finish this in one sitting...waffle fries too!  Don't forget to sip some of their wonderful sweet tea and save room for one of their delicious desserts like their banana pudding.    The food and service just don't disappoint!!!!",

It was close to closing time by the time we got to this place but it was still packed! Ordered the pit special with 5 different meats and 3 sides. They were out of mac and cheese by then but that wasn't a huge issue and we couldn't really blame them being so close to closing. We just got another side instead. Had to take the food to go since they were just about closed but everything was amazing. Great flavors and the meats were smoked perfectly and tender. Sides were awesome as well. There was so much food left we had the rest for breakfast in the morning. Me and boyfriend have returned every time we're in LV. For the two of us, we just share the 3 meat plate ($17.99/2=$8.99/person) and that's plenty of food for us. You seriously get a lot of food. Staff members are also great. Always happy to serve you and always cheerful and very helpful. Plenty of seating and everything you need for your meal is always stocked on the side table so you never have to wait to ask the staff for anything. Absolutely love this place!",

My friend has been wanting \"delicious\" smoked bbq for a long time and so I did as anyone would, researched and found Rollin Smoke Barbeque! The reviews were pretty much all 5 star so out of the choices, they got bumped up to #1  We arrived in Vegas, checked in, unpacked as much as we wanted and then off to get that yummy bbq.  The location is nothing much to draw you in but once inside, it's ok. There are benches, a counter with all the things you'll need, plastic ware, plates, to go containers, bags, napkins, sauces, etc and the counter where you order.  The staff and service are wonderful BUT the food is definitely not a 5, I'm so sorry to say.  All of the meat, ribs, brisket, pulled pork and chicken were in desperate need of SEASONING and the potato salad and corn bread needed something too, the waffle fries were good though and likely bc they were seasoned   I give the service a 5 but not the food and why I can only give a 3. I've actually had so much better and would've been truly upset if I'd traveled this far only for the bbq.  I'd still say to those reading, give it a try because we all have our own level of good so while my friend and I are critical, others will like it!  Enjoy!!",

I'm glad for two major things:(1) They've got. @ 6 different sauces from vinegar to Carolina mustard to hot. (2) They've got several unique \"sides.\" Corn nuggets and dirty rice w/scallions. Overall a good variety and I'd go back.",

    "text": "I love finding hidden local joints because it's not crowded and not at all pricy for the size of the dish . My boyfriend and i decided to come here when we read all the reviews on yelp. I am here to say that the reviews are pretty accurate. We ordered the sampler just because it's not easy to choose just one. We were able to substitute one of the meats out for a beef rib for an extra $6.  Our sampler came with tri tip, brisket, pork ribs, and sausage links (substituted it for a beef rib). The order of a sample also came with your choice of 3 sides. The sides we chose were the corn nuggets, waffle fries, and corn bread.   The sides were my favorite!!! If you like sweet creamy corn encased in crispy fried goodness, then you'll like this. I would definitely come back. They also have an ayce option which is a crazy idea to me since my boyfriend and I barely made a dent in our generously portioned sampler.  But hey, if you can eat, you might like this option.",

    "text": "Everything about this place is amazing. The staff were so helpful and welcoming. That really meant a lot to us, because just two days ago my poor family suffered racist taunts right on the strip! But we didn't have to be worried here. The staff and customers were people of all ethnicities who were kind and decent. Definitely a place locals go, seems like we were the only tourists there.   And the food! Look at the deliciousness I captured on camera! I adore burnt ends and scarfed a whole pound of them myself. Honestly if you're hungry get 2 pounds. 1 is good if you've a good appetite and plan on eating other stuff. Like the special my family ordered! Can't remember what they chose, but I remember that the sides were loaded mashed potatoes (so good!), baked beans (also delicious) and coleslaw (don't get this, it's sour and kinda flavorless). My mom also ordered a beautiful salad. You don't expect a bbq joint to have great salads, but they did!   It's nothing fancy inside, and it's very much a little hole in the wall. As most people know, that's where the best food is, so don't be a snob and let the food speak for itself. It's better and cheaper than other bbq places in our hometown of Los Angeles. It's not on the strip, but it's only maybe a 10-15 minute drive away. Go, you'll be full and satisfied.",

First off we get to order our food and the girl had already an attitude with taking our order I heard her say they didn't have chicken on the bone only pulled! So we already starting off bad, I make another choice of brisket and a hot link and Mac n cheese as my side. Got our food and the brisket was dry and no flavor what so ever their bbq sauce tasted like watered down ketchup and the hot link was okay but no bbq sauce to enjoy my food the Mac n cheese had pieces of pepper in it, it tasted like frozen velvita Mac n cheese! I could have went to Famous Dave's and probably would had been more satisfied. I don't recommend this place if you're looking for some good ol bbq.",

Burnt ends  Chopped brisket both on point   Spare ribs were great  Chicken wasn't over cooked   Waffle fries were seasoned, hot, and good.   The sauces The spicy means spicy. Not over the top hot but don't, I repeat don't dunk your food in it or you will pay.   The Mac and cheese also a solid choice.   Glad Yelp is alive and well bc we would have never found this place without them.   Featured on the travel channel and just a great hole in the wall place to eat. Bring and empty stomach tho!!",

The best was the sliced brisket, which was plenty lean and rubbed with a peppery rub. Fantastic!   We also had the chopped brisket, pulled pork and spare ribs. All were good as were the side dishes. The mac & cheese was best of those.  Portion size is plentiful making this a good value too.  We will definitely be back.",

You will not find such awesomeness on the strip...and super reasonable prices. Their burger was amazing-it was actually smoked! Their banana pudding was simply perfect. I have never had a better one and I'm a bit of a banana pudding addict. Just go- you will be so happy you did!",

They handled my huge order with ease.  We had brisket, beef ribs, baby backs, spare ribs, sausage, burnt ends, and chicken!! Everything was excellent. The brisket and burnt ends were devine!! The beef ribs were huge and tender as everyone loved the selection of meats that were put out. And then there were the sides. We had a pan of the bacon potato salad, a pan of the jalepeno cole slaw, a pan of the kickin beans, a pan of greens, a house salad as well as some candied yams. Just let me say that there was nothing left after the party as people went back for seconds and thirds! They will even do speacial orders on items not on the menu! I highly reccomend Rollin Smoke as the best BBQ In Vegas!!",

    "text": "I'm not one of those guys who will pretend to be an expert on Barbecue.  I'm not going to get into the debate of Texas vs. Carolina vs. Arkansas vs. wherever.  You've seen those charity ads with the tagline \"Hunger knows no borders?\"  Well, as far as I'm concerned, good BBQ knows no state lines.  If you insist upon knowing however, an Arkansas flag hanging inside provides a clue as to their roots.  As others have remarked, this place is located off the beaten track, and easy to miss.  Even with the GPS bleating at me and the smell of the smokers wafting through my windows, I blew by it and had to circle back.  The shopping center it is located in is a bit down-at-heel, but not dangerous.  Walk through the door and there is a podium at the back of the room with an \"Order Here\" sign.  It may be unattended, but there is a hotel desk-bell to help you get their attention.    There is a nice selection of dishes, sandwiches, platters, and combos, so you should be able to find something however small or large your appetite.    The BBQ is excellent.  Thoroughly smoked flavor; not dried out.  They provide sauce, but it really doesn't need it.  All in all, a great find, and worth the visit.",

Excellent dry rub and smoked to perfection. The brisket and baby backs are my favorite. The baby backs are melty tender in the middle and nice and jerky like on the ends.  The brisket is comparable to Rudy's and Blacks BBQ in TX - some of the best I've had. SUPER nice folks and a family run business. Location kinda sucks but it just adds to the True BBQ ambiance.

The restaurant has an offer on Yelp for a free desert if you check in.... make sure you let them know prior to finishing your order if not they will not honor it.

At first my boyfriend and I were looking for steak, we have these weekend staycations we stay at the hotels because we like room service in bed! We headed down stairs to the steak house and decided last minute how YUMMY BBQ would be!  So I YELP'd BBQ and a few places came up, one being Rollin Smoke and most others smack in the middle of the busy Saturday night strip time (no thanks)...  We drove about the mile yelp said, and yes it was a super dark street not a lot of cars around... and I started getting that \"I think I've seen this Law and Order episode\" about the couple that goes to the dimly light bbq place and is never seen again.  So we drive past and I say to my BF \"you know it is normally these off the beat path ones that are AWESOME!!! And you can't ignore the 3 GIANT smokers in the parking lot!!  So I say let's go!\"  When we got in the place was quite nicely decorated and very clean, you can smell the food which made my tummy start screaming \"FEED ME\" The 2 gentlemen running the BBQ place were as kind as can be!  We each to get the ribs and chicken combo with side of coleslaw & BBQ beans. The prices were great over there and they have a bunch of things to choose from which was great!! SInce the place was not packed we got to sit in the room with the TV and they even let us watch what we wanted.  Our food came out and we were shocked to see they there was enough to feed a small village in just one order!  I don't even know the best way to describe this smoked deliciousness of ribs and chicken that hit my belly! Oh it was heaven, the chicken fell off the bone when I picked it up and the ribs were so tender! And I got the flashback of a few minutes earlier of the chef saying \"he was from the (arkansas or Alabama) and he took much pride in his smoked bbq.\" NOW if ALL bbq places would care that much!!!   They must start cooking their meats early early to get them with that much flavor.  In my life I only profess & save my undying love for very special things, so far only my doctor and a sushi place from LA have made it on this list, but I know I am adding \"Rollin Smoke\" to it now!!!  I had my leftovers for breakfast and my grandmother had some of my chicken left, she commented it was the best she had ever had!! (and that was cold leftovers)!!!     I know it might seem sketchy when you drive up but DON'T be a fool and pass it by just for that!!! This BBQ is some serious HEAVEN!!!!",

They've made major improvements and now this is going to be back on my dining rotation.   I came to eat on a Saturday afternoon and was shocked that there wasn't the usual line out the door. The two employees at the registers were very fast at taking orders and moved everyone through quickly. I was most impressed. The lovely woman who helped us was so friendly and eager to please. None of our special requests were denied, and she was absolutely delightful to deal with. I wanted all white meat on my combo plate, no problem. She answered all of my food questions cheerfully and correctly. I was most impressed.   The dining area had been changed since my last visit, with far more tables and open spaces. Everything was a picnic table, so if you have a bad back, be warned.   I had the combo plate with chopped brisket and white meat chicken, with the collard greens as my side and an unsweetened iced tea. I was so happy to see that they now have Splenda as a sweetener choice! The iced tea was fresh brewed Lipton, very tasty. I drank so much tea. Hubby had burnt ends and fried pickles.  Our lunches came out extremely fast, which was a change from the past. It was almost as quick as fast food! I was pleased with the portion sizes too, and my meat was fresh, well-seasoned, and moist and tender. The collard greens had brisket in them instead of traditional pork, and the flavor was actually exciting. It was delicious! The fried pickles were good too, not too greasy with a crispy batter. They're made with pickle chips not spears, which keeps the breading on through every bite.   The signature sauces are still free too, so be sure to try them all. I drowned my bbq in the tasty Carolina Vinegar sauce (reminds me of my childhood).   I was so happy with my meal here and I'm so glad they've fixed the problems and issues from the past. The restaurant was also spotlessly clean, and the employees seemed genuinely eager to please and help. I felt like a valued customer too, and that's the most important element of customer service.",

But if you grew up in the west, this place is as good as it gets...and that's NOT a bad thing.   They have delicious brisket with tons of sauces to satisfy anyone. Surprisingly the corn nuggets were effing delicious! Highly recommend it.   I also had the chicken breast which was juicy and flavorful.   I don't remember exactly what it said on the menu, but I believe there is an all you can eat for about $35. It includes anything on the menu. So if you want to put your liver in check and fill yourself with delicious meat goodness, this is the place.",

The restaurant is arranged with an indoor picnic feel with 3 rooms of picnic table style seating. There are about 2-3 tables in each room.

He had nothing but high praises for this place. If you are ever in Vegas, do yourself a favor and treat your tired taste buds to this AMAZING place.  We tried their brisket, ribs, pulled pork, hot links, and meat loaf. I've tried American BBQ all over the country, and this place REALLY blew me away. All the meats were extremely tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Paired with sweet tangy BBQ sauce, the meats come to full life. This is by far, the best BBQ I've ever had. We also tried 3 sides: the green beans, mac and cheese, and waffle fries. All were also really impressive, but my favorite was the green beans. It added a nice crunch and starchiness to the meal. Make sure you come SUPER hungry because the restaurant will FEED you. You will want to eat until you get a big food baby!  Skip the food on the Strip. The real treasure is only minutes away :)",

    "text": "3.5 stars  Got the Rib platter, 1 beef rib, 3 baby back ribs and 2 St Louis ribs ($24.99) and then added an extra beef rib for $6 and a 1/2 pound of sliced brisket for $10.99.  The beef rib looked like it was going to be the favorite, but it was the pork ribs that were the best, they were the most tender and fall off the bone.  The beef ribs were not as tender as they looked.  The brisket was nice and smoky but i think i like them to be more succulent and juicy, but I'm not usually a fan of brisket so take it with a grain of salt.  There were many sauces to choose from, personally i think the \"Boss Sauce\" was easily the favorite.  I like hot sauces but the 2 different hot BBQ sauces were too vinegary for my liking.  All the meats had a very nice smoky flavor to them, i just wish the brisket and beef ribs were more tender.  For my side i had the dirty rice, which i thought was good but nothing exceptional.  They do have an All you can eat option for $35 which i think is way better than any buffet deal on the strip as long as you only want BBQ and not seafood.  I might explore this option next time as it includes EVERYTHING on the menu.",

The meat was flavorful even without sauce, but don't worry, Rollin Smoke has you covered with a full selection of various sauces. If you like it enough, you can buy bottles of their \"Arkansauce\" to take home!  The only piece of feedback I have is to let customers know that the meat by the pound comes with sauce already on it. My bf and I are keto and we didn't know the burnt ends already came with bbq sauce on them. Probably something they should state on the menu. Otherwise, it was good quality bbq!",

Outside they have their bbq trailers so you know they are serious about their bbq.   Their menu takes a while to take in to decide what you want to get. I recommend looking it over before hand otherwise you'll end up ordering one of the combo platters like I did that Has a little bit of everything. They do have a AYCE option for the BBQ items which is unheard of for bbq.   The combo platter I got had: Pulled pork: good smoke, great flavor I liked it with the spicy bbq sauce Brisket: nice and juicy good portion sizes with good flavor. This tasted best with the vinegar sauce Hot links: love these, had great taste and the spice was on the back end.  Spare ribs: these were a little dry but easily fixed with the sweet bbq sauce.  Chicken: juicy with good seasoning. Didn't need any sauces.  For sides I got: Corn bread: more like corn cake, these were so moist and tasted so good could have eaten these for dessert Mac&cheese: cheesey goodness with some hints of jalapeno for heat Baked beans: good taste and flavor  Overall you'll be happy you stopped by.  Make sure you check out the fish tank before you leave.",

I really felt immersed in the southern culture and couldn't wait to get eating!   The service was decent, the gentleman that took our order was a little short and impersonable- not that he was rude, but as a first timer I expected a different level of service when inquiring about what they are known for and what's the best on the menu. I figured because this place is located just off the strip that was the reason he was probably burnt out from visitors seeking all the hype from this place.   Overall, the food was great! Portions were decent I expected more from the sides (We ordered-Mac and Cheese and Boudin links) but they did the job. Heck, where can I go anywhere near Las Vegas and find Boudin on the menu, so I'll be happy it's here to begin with!   The Beef Ribs were large and in charge! I enjoyed slathering the amazing sauces over them and coupling it with the sliced bread and pickle that come with it.  Brisket. brisket. Brisket.  Just get the Brisket or Brisket Sandwich and Thank. Me. Later!   If you are ready for a BBQ adventure with some crazy good sauces look no further- Rolling Smoke does it well.",

Good deal for 2 people. Everything tasted amazing!! Definitely loves the pulled pork and the ribs. Those were my favorite. They also had sauces for dipping. My favorite was the Mama's Sweet D'licious. We also got drinks that came in cute souvenir plastic cups. We'll definitely be coming back to this place. Great food. Great atmosphere.

On the other hand, while all the meats (chopped brisket, hot links, pulled pork, and chicken - ordered the D-plater) were also flavorful with the rub, they were slightly dry and not as juicy as the ribs.    I enjoyed all the variety of the homemade BBQ sauces made with freshly grounded black pepper.  Nice zest and spiciness.    The sides: greens, Mac n cheese and dirty rice were very enjoyable too.  All were perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients and well balanced flavors.    Now, I must warn you against the peach cobbler.  Yes, not good at all.  How the heck could they hook up the savory and fall short with desserts? We also had the banana pudding and that was good.  I think my expectations were too high post the meal.   All the staff were very attentive and kind, even though you order at counter and they just call out your name and bring to your table.  On a couple of occasion, while walking by staff asked how are things.  Don't always get that for full service restaurants.  It's obviously a culture of respecting and appreciating their customers.

    "text": "I went to Rollin Smoke Barbeque for an easy Sunday lunch with my husband, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend. We'd spent all weekend eating decadent, expensive meals on the Strip, and it was nice to get something homey and cheap in a lower-case strip mall. My brother had a car, so it wasn't hard to get to, and parking was a cinch.  We walked in around one and there was a short line to order. Service was friendly and quick, and there were plenty of open tables. The place was casual and pleasant, cheerfully decorated with a lively, comfortable atmosphere.  The food was pretty delicious for the most part. The four of split the Pit Special and an order of the baby back ribs. The Pit Special came with five meats and three sides, and we either supplemented with an extra side, or the ribs came with a side too, I don't remember. In any case, we had six meats and four sides with bread and pickles to boot. This was a lot of food for a very reasonable amount of money.  The $27.99 Pit Special came with brisket, pulled pork, a 1/4 chicken, two spare ribs, and a hot link. The brisket was excellent, perfectly fork-tender with a crusty rub. The spare ribs were on point, as were the juicy chicken and the flavorful hot link. The pulled pork was just okay, but surprisingly, the weak link here was the half-rack of baby back ribs. The ribs were actually bad, tough and dry. I wonder if it was a freak batch, as the other meats were so good. We helped ourselves to the variety of sauces--there were five of them, I think, including a nice spicy one and a golden mustard sauce.  The sides were great. I enjoyed the corn nuggets, which were deep-fried, golden chunks of sweet corn and crispy breading. The loaded mash looked and tasted unhealthy in a very good way, piled with cheese and bacon bits, with a tiny sprinkle of green onion. The mac n' cheese was solid, as were the garlicky green beans.  I'd recommend Rollin Smoke Barbeque if you're looking for a break from Strip prices, especially if you have a car and want a belly full of meat. I guess the baby backs aren't a sure thing, but spread your bets with a Pit Special and you should make out pretty well.",

    "text": "My husband loves this place.  He's been talking about it ever since we ate here last month.  He wanted to go and pick up food to celebrate Father's Day.  He's completely hooked.    I really enjoyed my food too.  I had ribs and the loaded mashed potatoes. I definitely recommend the loaded mash. I would honestly go back just to eat that.    My husband had a selection of meats.  He loves hush puppies so we opted for an order of these instead of me getting some cornbread. I have issues with some of the seasoning commonly used for this snack. I didn't like them because of my personal tastes.  They were made crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.   They have fun drink choices like Kool-Aid.  I haven't had this sugary abomination for at least 25 years.  I thought the words and taste would never cross my fancy lips again but I was so wrong.  As soon as I saw it, I wanted it.  It's liquid, food colored, sweetness on ice. There was other stuff too like Country Time lemonade.  It's self-serve so you can make crazy combinations like I did.  Choose your poison to compliment the delicious foods.    We've only visited once but I'm sure hubby will day we are going back again soon.",

I don't think so.  When my order came the beef rib was definitely the largest item on the plate.  When I tasted the rib I was speechless, this meat was more tender than any pork rib I have ever had.  The flavor was unbelievable.  I devoured the rib and was almost full when I finished it.  I forced myself to sample the other ribs, the dirty rice (which was wonderful by itself) and the corn fritters. Although it was a little strange ordering at the counter the wait staff was available most of the time. The food was great, the beef rib is second to none and I will definitely be coming back.",

The restaurant itself is just plane benches, so don't be expecting anything fancy (most good BBQ joints aren't).  This is certainly a BBQ joint.

    "text": "Frequently thrown into conversations about the best BBQ in Vegas Rollin Smoke is certainly better than most, but is it actually good BBQ? I tried to write this view avoiding all hints of BBQ snobbery but that is just impossible for me- the snob is too strong. So you may want to take my comments with a grain of salt- for the average American RSB is probably perfectly acceptable BBQ. Having lived in the south and spent a lot of time in Texas and KC it wasn't all that I hoped it would be, but it was still probably the best in Vegas (probably need to due a more detailed head to head vs Road Kill)   If you are from the south or KC you will prob find RSB to be pretty mediocre. If, however, you are a Las Vegas local who doesn't get to travel to BBQ hotspots frequently then it is a lifeline. Its all a matter of perspective really. There is nothing wrong with RSB, the food is pretty good. It would not, however, stay in business in large scale BBQ cities.  I got the buffet so I could try everything. My favorite BBQ, or really any, food is beef rib so I ordered one of those right off the bat. The beef rib was a little dry, something several people had warned me about in advance, but smothered with sauce it was pretty decent. Not life changing, but definitely good and considering how few places in LV even serve beef rib its probably the go to for that.   Pulled Pork- this was better than the beef rib. Not dry, pretty flavorful, went well with the sauce. They showed the pig the respect it deserves  Pork rib- def better than the beef rib here. Seemed like it had been smoked for a good amount of time and wasn't way over done to the point where the bones fall apart or anything  Brisket- meh. The brisket I got had very little fat and so very little flavor and was somewhat dry. I like big thick slices of brisket, these were very thin and not very tall, so I'm guessing they weren't cut off a complete brisket.   Chicken- this was actually pretty good. I don't normally order chicken at BBQ places because its chicken and pig is usually available but since it was all you can eat I gave it a whirl. Would eat again  Mac and Cheese- this seemed like it had some potential but was served pretty cold.  It was in fact Cheezy  Baked Beans- these were great, would eat again and in large quantity.   Corn nuggets- fried corn, hard to go wrong, could eat about 3 lbs of these in one sitting.",

Lol I'm guessing this is supposed to be gourmet BBQ? IDK but the food was almost gross. Brisket reminded me of Spam, ribs didn't really have a taste, and the mac & cheese must've been made with sour cream because it was a little too creamy with a weird taste. The kickn beans were bland and undercooked. The hot links I'm guessing Hoffy or Bar S? Yuck. And guess wat? I decided to go all out and order desert. Peach cobbler! Ugh more like bland peach cake!  The prices are high with small portions and meals only come with 1 side! Where they do that at? Let's not even talk about the area this is located in. This was a total fail!

Ribs were the best I have had in LV. A friend of mine had the outlaw burger and I tried a small bite.  Perfect balance of flavor, my only suggestion is to not over mix the ground meat, also mix the meat when it is really cold. The texture of the burger was off for a med/mid rare burger, really dense as if the meat was over worked, it was like meatloaf. Other then that, its worth the wait. This will now be the only place I will go for Bbq for a while.  GREAT JOB, R&S!",

The food here went above and beyond what I ever could have expected from BBQ in Vegas. The location is off the beaten path, but once you find it you truly feel like you've found a hidden gem.   I'm not usually big on okra, but the fried okra here was perhaps the best I've ever had. And like I said, I lived in the South for 12 years.  This is a great place to grab a low-price, good quality meal in Vegas. If you're a tourist, like I am, and you have a rental car, it's well worth the trip for a tasty meal at an awesome price.",

I guess they left a little to long in the smoker, or maybe it was the left over that sat out with out being covered so it dried out. Who knows. Maybe next time when I come in, it will be better.",

    "text": "I've had the privilege of enjoying real southern BBQ down south, South Carolina, Georgia, New Orleans...I've tasted authentic. Rollin' Smoke offers what I consider the most authentic BBQ in Las Vegas by a long shot. There aren't any competitors even worth mentioning to compare. 1) Atmosphere: it's a rather small property that's divided into a few section, one where you place your orders/grab your drinks, utensils etc/some seating available, and two other sections offering seating as well. Regardless of how you're eating (take-out, dining in, a la carte, all-you-can-eat), there is one line for all. You can sit wherever you'd like while you wait for your food to be delivered including outdoors.  2) Service: Everyone on staff is super friendly and very helpful. It was our first time there and we didn't feel rushed while we took a minute in line getting an explanation of how the menu works. Food was delivered timely and correctly.  3) Food: I'll start with saying my ribs literally fell off the bone when I picked up my first bite. Now... All-you-can-eat is $24.95 and includes anything on the menu. Pace yourself! You can always come back for more. We grabbed a bit of each meat and were very pleased with every type- ribs, brisket, chicken, catfish (very fresh, lightly crunchy and not fishy-tasting). Everything was exceptional, including our sides of Mac and cheese, cole slaw and hush puppies. Oh the hush puppies! So yummy! Dessert was awesome. Next time we'll have to try our berry cobbler a la mode.   Looking forward to coming back next time. Thanks guys!",

It was melt in your mouth good, savory with just a little sweet. This is one of the best BBQ places I've ever been.

    "text": "I had been looking forward to this place after seeing it air on the Food Network, I was surprised at the location to be honest with you. Rollin Smoke is situated in an older industrial commercial area behind the strip, it is easy to get to but can be a bit confusing if you're not from here. It smelled great of course and the place was smaller than I thought, there were people lined up along the wall to place their orders. I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs, 1 pound of brisket and a quart of the BBQ beans to go. The food was good, the ribs were a bit dry but still moist and the brisket was chopped? I was actually expecting sliced brisket but I guess you have to ask for it sliced. I wasn't amazed but it was good and I will be back for more. The Kicken beans were awesome though, a bit of heat with pulled pork. One thing I did not like was that I had to pay for extra sauce because there was no to go containers for the sauce and the sauce in the dispenser is for those that are dining in only and I was told that I would have to buy extra. The other was that it felt a bit crowded in there especially the main room where there were people eating at the tables while having people waiting for their food hovering over them just seemed a bit uncomfortable for me and that's why I chose it to go. There was no space in the other room because it was packed and the only other option was outdoor seating and that was way out of the question in 106 degree weather.",

The catfish is thin and frail with no crunch to it at all. The  bread is a hoagie bun which is too thick of a bread for a po boy. The frail fish sits on top of a bed of romaine lettuce and diced tomatoes. The taste wasn't bad but with the excessive bread and frail non-crispy fish I definitely won't get it again. And my fries were cold and stale like they were fried last night. Def not worth the $18 I spent.",

I thought it was just good a place that i dont mind going to...On that occasion i ordered a half rack of ribs, mac and cheese, mashed and 2 beef ribs..  I thought it was good..  I went here recently with a friend of mine.. This time I ordered the meatloaf.. It was absolutely the best meatloaf i have ever had EVER... Cheesecake factory has a version of this but it does not even compare to this... It sat on top of a bed of mashed potatoes with this bbq gravy,, topped with onion straws..  I believe they smoke the meatloaf... Whatever they do,, I am a big fan... It was one of those meals that you will remember..  My friend got the outlaw burger,, He really liked it and it was impressive when it was brought out...  It looked like a mess to eat,, but looked good..  The desserts are decent but this meatloaf was slap your mother good...  Hope this Yelps  11/232014 It was about 11pm,,, i was really craving bbq,,  I remembered that Roling Smoke was open late... I ordered the rib combo... Lets just say dont come here for a late night meal,, at least this night...  All 3 meats were bone dry,, i asked for extra sauce,, but it wasnt  in my order,,, the sides were good,, but the berry cobbler,, seemed old... I have to admit it was after 11 but wow what a disappointment... I had to remove a star,,   I will try them when i think the meats would be freshest... Remember based on my experience,, I will not eat here again after 7 pm on a weekend...",

I'm always down for some good BBQ as she is too so we gave it a go!! As I also looked at the pictures and the comments on Yelp my expectations of this place grew. We pulled Into the parking lot and could smell the aroma of the wood and meat cooking, very promising. We ordered the three way brisket, BBQ nacho fries with pulled pork, and the rack of St Louis spare ribs. The St Louis spare ribs we such a disappointment. They were over smoked and tasted as if the meat had went bad. The brisket was good not great but good and the BBQ nachos were ok as well. But I'm writing this only because I was highly disappointed in the St Louis spare ribs, also I did not find any of their BBQ sauce to my liking!!! Since I did not like the ribs and we had left overs; we brought them home for our kids to try, the 14 year old said, \" Your ribs are better!\" The 9 year old spit hers out!!!!!   I would say try it out and make your own opinion!!!",

    "text": "Like a pimp, Rollin Smoke BBQ is whoring out their entire menu for $24.99.  That's right....You ever walk into a BBQ joint and want to try everything on the menu?  Well here you can.  I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered.  Just the $28 rack of baby backs would have made it worth my while to do the all you can eat.  Smoked Meatloaf sounds awesome, and the burgers looked great too.  You can bet I will be back to try them on my next Vegas trip.    Truth be told, I should most likely give this place 4 stars, just based on what I ate.  The pulled pork was kind of a let down for me.  Not much sauce mixed in with it, I found it kind of flavorless, and not smokey at all.  However the sauce on the table added a much needed zing and saved it - 3 stars.  The brisket was better and had a nice smoke ring to it as well as a dry rub.  It was sliced in thick slices how I prefer it - 4 stars  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#0Lk8zyIUqCEMxyYmpGMTyg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  The baby back ribs were the best of the three meats that I tried.  They had a nice bark to it, but still fell off the bone.  There were plenty of meat on these ribs and it was clear they were slowly smoked and had a great hickory flavor to them.  Ribs are always the main test of BBQ for me and these baby backs clearly passed the test and are darn good - 4.5 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#fSy8vbKrCQuI8Sgv8I5qmA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  For the sides we tried the bacon potato salad, the kicken beans, the mac 'n cheese, and some sliced pickles.  The pickles were very good and had a nice vinegary flavor to them.  It's clear they will stand out well on any of their sandwiches.  Tasted exactly like the large dill pickles you get at Disney, in case you need that for a reference.  The kicken' beans, lived up to their name and had some spice to them along with a good peppery flavor.  There were some shards of brisket added in for some smokey flavor.  I personally prefer sweeter southern baked beans, but for some reason those are hard to get outside of the south.  Bacon potato salad, could have had more bacon in it as I couldn't really find any in there.  I still enjoyed it and it had a texture of a smashed potato salad.  The clear star of the show was the mac 'n cheese.  Some of the best I've had, it's very cheesy and creamy.  I don't see myself ever coming here without getting a bowl of it.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#ph5LXQhF8FkZ-8nd6jVSfw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  Although we were plenty stuffed, I noticed a free dessert with check in.  All the desserts sounded great, but we went with the banana pudding.  No matter how full you get, for some reason, you can always manage a little banana pudding.  It just kind of slides down.  Rather than vanilla wafers it was more of a swirl of vanilla crust in the pudding.  It was ok, but I think I would try another dessert next time - 3.5 stars. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#B-ruv_7a2ibeC_2NaLAEWw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  I love the vibe of this place, it's clear these are men living their dream.  The toys they have to play with in the parking lot are impressive, all kinds of mobile smokers and dressed up cars and trucks with their logo painted all over it.  It's like the bat cave of BBQ.  Holy Smoke Batman....To the Rollin' Smokemobile Robin!  And just like that they are on the move to provide smokey BBQ goodness wherever hungry folk most need them.  Also make sure you visit their party room and you will find a fun pig shaped fish tank that looks like a BBQ smoker.  Look inside and rather than coral you have all kinds of smoked meats for the fish to swim with.  Hit the button and smoke even comes out of the top of the tank.  Apparently this tank was featured on Animal Planet's show - Tanked. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#QMwyRQhoijuHeKKEaQLoeA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#VrpJ5wb8xPouU_LyfaecEw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roll...</a>",

It comes on a sesame seed bun which is alright , but delicious nonetheless.  My hubby got 1/2 rack of baby back ribs with cheesy mac and waffle fries. He hasn't said a word since he started eating ;) I tried it and let me tell you the ribs are smoked to perfection.  The mac and cheese is delightfully balanced , and the waffle fries are crispy and not too greasy.  Two thumbs up! Oh and we got it for around $37.00",

Pretty sure I could live off that the rest of my life breakfast lunch and dinner! Yummy! Hubby had the outlaw burger. He's a big dude and couldn't eat it all.

Well thanks to Rolling Smoke BBQ, I've found a little bit of smoky heaven right in Vegas. The meats and sides are wonderful. Nothing fancey or pretentious,  just great food. The portions are large and I think they even have an all you can eat option. there isn't much going on as far as decor.  Just Picnic tables. This is straight out of the Texas BBQ hand book,",

We were prepared to hire bus staff from another vendor but they stated they had to have their own team bus the tables and serve.   They didn't do anything.  Now they are not responding to any of the items we have in writing and i will have to bring in our lawyer.   Not worth the headache. And if you saw the mess they call an invoice you would understand why they do not have any kind of business skill other than cooking.  I would suggest using any other BBQ company in town to not have to deal with this chef and his lack of business  One more thing.. if you do use them be sure to check the math .. as I had to correct it for them during this process",

    "text": "I'm going to have to drop my 4 star rating to a 2.5. based on my last experience. I understand about the beef shortage in TX so I understand why rolling smoke raised their prices.  I always get the AYCE option, and one of their employees remembers me because I always order it.  What I don't understand is why rolling smoke is sending out a quarter of the portions that they used to with each order of food. Before, I would order a meatloaf and get a FULL order( 2 nice slices) of meatloaf. Not a little crumpled portion from the end. Before I would order a of beef ribs and get 2 in an order, not one. This last visit, not only did the order taker miss a few of the items initially ordered, but they NEVER(even in previous visits) ask if you want to order more. You have to compete with the people in line and it creates and awkward situation. All portions sent out were not even close to what I used to get and sadly, I was bringing in people for thier first visit. How are you going to justify an order of wings and only give 2 wings in an order?  The 4 meat platter came with 2 tiny strips of brisket and the wrong sides.   You guys gotta find a better system for the AYCE. Maybe a flag on the table so your staff knows who is spending  twice the amount of money than the average guest and could show them a little more attention. Also accuracy in order taking is important too. I didn't mind the mistakes and poor service before, because there was value in what you were serving.  Now Higher price/way smaller portions/no server/difficulty in ordering at $35 a person plus 20% tip?  Ouch. That's disappointing. You can't raise prices and give your guests way less. That's a no no.  Please fix this.",

The prices are totally reasonable & the flavor of the BBQ overall will keep us coming back for more. I ordered the half slab of BBQ chicken & my guy ordered the Pit Special with  4 different types of meat including the Brisket, spare ribs, hot links, & pulled pork.

I feel like I can make a mess of myself,  wear a bib made of paper napkins and feel proud doing it. Free refills on the drinks and quality friendly staff make this place a obvious no 1 choice for bbq. Gordon ramsey abd his 20dollar burger can rot compared to a gem like this. one of the best burgers I ever tasted. The staff is so wholesome and authentically country with the way they carry themselves and the food, by mere presence they made me think they are co owners with the pride they have for their food. I didnt detect any of the fake kindness you often see at regular food joints. The owners should be proud of themselves and their staff.",

For yhe 2nd time in a row they forgot to put items i had ordered in the bags. At 70 bucks a pop per trip feeding me and my kids, I would expect a bit more quality control on their part especially when its not even busy. I called to complain and all they could tell me is \"we left a note by the register, come get them when you come in next and u wont be charged\". SO SORRY ITS MY FAULT YOU FORGOT MY ITEMS I PAID FOR! Im done with this place. For those hankerin for bbq try it once you wont be disappointed, but as a repeat customer thats all you ever will be....disappointed.",

We were feeling a yen for BBQ after seeing Lyle Lovett & His Big Band over at the Smith Center, so I Yelp-ed Barbecue and the rave reviews for Rollin Smoke made our choice easy.  We arrived a little after 10pm and were told that they were out of meatloaf, yams, cornish hen, burnt ends, and beef ribs.  Since they advertise that they're open until midnight, I thought this was rather extensive a list of food to be out of.  We ordered a combo plate of brisket, chicken, hot links, pulled pork and pork ribs, along with sides of cole slaw, corn bread and corn fritters.  Hubby had the brisket and chicken, neither of which filled him up... kinda small portions of both.  My ribs were tough - not fall off of the bone tender at all.  The pulled pork and links were both OK, not anything special.  The highlight, in my opinion, was the corn bread.  I'd go back for more of that... it almost tasted like it had a coating of honey butter, which was delish.  Hence, the 2 stars.",

First the disclaimer: I am from Texas and believe as fervently as any fanatic that the world's finest BBQ is produced in Central Texas and the sauce should always be served on the side. That said, I am not in Central Texas now and Rollin Smoke is real BBQ for sure.  I have eaten here three times and was satisfied every time, The pork shoulder is mighty fine, brisket real good too, however the ribs have been a little dry both times I ordered them. Maybe I just played unlucky and ordered them at the wrong time. I like their sauce quite a lot, it's tart, not too thick and spicy enough that one is not tempted to overdo it.  I called at 8:40 PM last night, although they were closed Chef Tim was gracious enough to let me pick up 2 lbs, of sliced brisket after hours. The brisket was excellent, juicy with a very dark crust and just enough fat. Had just received a selection of sauces from Franklin BBQ in Austin,TX; favorite of Texas cult BBQ and uber hip Austinites, wanted to do a taste test immediately.  I cannot believe that I drove by this place for 6 months before I stopped, such is the sad state of BBQ (and Mexican Food) in Las Vegas. I expect to be disappointed so I postpone it as long as possible. My advice is don't wait another day, go now.",

But once you walk in, you are greeting with a delicous smell of BBQ and walls of True Razorback fans! The inside is completely different the outside. This place is True BBQ. Everything was fantastic and the owner is really, really nice. We all got something different and there wasn't one back thing. I got the beef ribs which were literally fall off the bone. We also got the smoked meatloaf and pulled piggy sandwich. The piggy sandwich was very tender and moist but the star of the meals really was the meatloaf. I don't like meatloaf but I liked this one. It isn't your traditional meatloaf, it is smoked and BBQ. So very good. The portions are huge as well! You really don't need too many sides if any but if you do get some, the greens are good, yams and mac n cheese are good! I bet the rest are as well. I highly recommend going here! Yum!",

You can read my review about Memphis BBQ...  hind sight is 20/20 ... and oh how I wish we would have stopped at Rollin Smoke first.  Live and learn!   The place smells great when you walk in the door... the guys, there were really nice and welcomed us in...  The menu is diverse...   I had the three meat plate...  brisket, ribs, and pulled pork.   Brisket was really good... Ribs were even better... and the Pulled Pork was KILLER!   Portions were generous... flavors were fantastic!  The potato salad had some spice to it and so did the pickles.   My wife had two meats, pulled pork and brisket... she raved about both.  She is a huge brisket fan, and she said it reminded her of being in Texas.  She loved it!   I think the guys there have a handle on the BBQ side of things... it's great! Where I think, they could use some help is in the dessert's area... they were just alright.  I wasn't there to have dessert... so not a big deal... but... it's the only weak link about the place which stood out to me.  Dial that in... it's a 5+ star place.   Well worth a visit if you want fantastic BBQ!",

    "text": "I currently live in Dallas, so BBQ is everywhere, good and bad. I didn't think I'd be hitting up a BBQ place in Vegas on my last trip out, but we saw the reviews and were nearby (I had to at least go see the cat show at the Riviera), so we squeezed in. The layout of the restaurant was a little disorienting upon entry, given the vast light/dark difference from outside to inside. They have a huge menu on the wall, or printed menus you can take and look at. Order at the counter/cash register/stand thing. They have lots of specials/combos where you get a fountain drink (self serve, with refills), a side, and a main (sandwich, wrap, salad, or just meat by the 'slab'). I was feeling obese that day, so I got a salad with pulled chicken, the cole slaw, and a cornbread. All three things were amazing. My companions had half a smoked chicken which was just ridiculously juicy and smokey. The rest of the crew got brisket sandwiches (pile of brisket on a hotdog/small hoagie bun), mac n' cheese, and beans. The mac n' cheese wasn't met with much enthusiasm given the runniness of the cheese sauce and the firmness or thickness of the type of noodle used. The beans were described as 'kickin' by both the owner and the one at my table eating them, so I imagine that was a good thing. Overall, I will definitely be back here for more BBQ when I'm in Vegas. The food was just too good to not go back.",

But, that just seems to solidify their reputation as the town's best barbecue. No legitimate barbecue place could occupy a clean,modern building, right? For my first visit I had to try the rib platter ($22.99). With fall-off-the-bone tender baby back ribs with a good crust/bark and smokey flavor, thick and meaty spare ribs, and a massive, charred and fatty beef rib, this was a great option to try multiple proteins. For a side, I went with the mac 'n cheese. Made from elbow pasta and sitting in a thick, creamy cheese sauce topped with cheddar, it only served as a speed bump in my road to devouring the barbecue. I'll agree with many others in saying this is the city's best 'cue, at least from what I've tried so far. Locals get a 10% discount.",

    "text": "I have bookmarked this joint a while back and finally managed to swing by today.  I was heading toward Spring Mountain through the south off ramp from the I-15 flyway to get my pho sesh when I realized that Rollin' Smoke was right off Highland Drive.  I don't know about y'all, but there is only one thing I do in this industrial area at involves poles and minimal clothing, so yeah....great place to put a BBQ establishment!  I decided to go with something not too heavy, not knowing that a light meal here is equivalent to a light meal in Hawaii...no such things as smeediums here.  The sandwiches offer a check in discount to include some dessert as well.  I ended up saving mine after being more than satisfied following my meal.  I opted for the Outlaw, for those that know, you know.  It comes with a brisket burger, deep fried onion crisps, there very own BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese on a lightly toasted bun and topped with some pickles and peppers.  Additionally, I made it a meal and added fried okra on the side.    The meal came out rather quickly, considering that there were other patrons that were there before me, but have not yet gotten their dishes...and when their dishes did come out, it wasn't anything huge or extravagant.  So note to self, burgers and sandwiches come with the quickness.  However, there is something about burgers that in now way humanly possible can fit into anyone's mouth, no matter how much you smash it down by hand.  I had to cut the bad boy into 4's in order to get it down without getting cited for indecency.  Kinda like getting a salad from a place that serves it on the smallest petrie dish ever constructed...I never seemed to ever get the logic in that.  But seriously, I'd rather complain about my meal being way over sized versus being a meal for an action figure.    One thing I noticed though, they do not ask how you would like your burger, meaning that it comes standard as what looked to be medium rare plus, but not quite well.  It was moist and flavorful, but started to toughen up towards the end when it cooled off.  The Okra was on point and the BBQ is a nice compliment.    The decor is like most BBQ joints that is accustomed to getting thrashed following a nice serving, evidenced by the whole paper towel rolls at each table.  There is no sense getting all done up if you are there to get dirty.  Yet, there was three flat screens playing three different ESPN channels, always a good sign.  The place appears to stick to it's Arkansas roots and has the Razorback Fight Song posted on the wall in the extended dining room.  What rubbed me the wrong way was that I dropped a few bucks in the tip bucket right in front of the waiter, and he did not even acknowledge it.  That was disturbing since I actually clean up after myself pretty well.  I almost felt like sticking my hand back in the bucket like I was fishing for catfish, but oh well, I may be making too big a deal about it.   I definitely want to come back to try the ribs and other offerings, so if its BBQ you want, this is the place to be.",

I haven't had much barbecue out here and was skeptical of how good barbecue could be, but yes, there is good barbecue in Las Vegas.  I've only been twice and both times I got their duo plate.  With these plates you get the option to choose from: Brisket, hot links, spare ribs, 1/4 chicken, and pork.  I got the brisket and hot link.  The brisket is very juicy and you can see the beautiful smoke ring around the edge of the meat.   The hot link has a nice snap to it and is definitely one of my favourite parts of the meal.   Along with the meat you get an option of a side and I've gotten the mac n cheese and the potato salad.  The mac n cheese was alright, nothing too special, but I do love their potato salad. It's creamy and the potatoes are still firm. It's a nice refreshing taste when eaten with the rest of the meal.  Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick lunch or just in the mood for some barbecue!",

    "text": "I have seen Rollin Smoke on several Food/ Travel Channel specials, and have been anticipating my trip in since I planned a trip to Vegas several months ago. We stopped in about 11:30 and though it was fairly busy it wasn't hard to get a table and we didn't wait in line or for our food very long.  The parking however is very sparse so we had to park on the street across the way a bit.  I have to say that the main takeaway that I got from Rollin Smoke is that Salt Lake City (where I live) has some very underrated BBQ places. For what has been stated as one of the best BBQ places in the country I honestly have enjoyed certain items at places here in UT even better.  That out of the way we were very please with the food and clearly their technique is flawless. The smoke rings were perfect and they did have hands down the best ribs in every way that I have ever had. One thing I did not notice on the board is that if you don't ask for it specifically they default to chopping up their brisket, and though it was quite tasty I would have preferred my brisket to be sliced, and I am surprised (since I've never seen it that way before) that chopped rather than sliced is their default.  They also had the best mustard based BBQ sauce I've ever had which they call \"Sweet Country Girl\", and their other sauces are quite tasty too but I typically prefer a thicker Texas style sauce (didn't effect my review, just a note) to their Louisiana/ Alabama style thin vinegar sauces.  I Ordered a 3 meat plate: Ribs, Pork, Brisket and a side of their potato salad. The portions were good but not generous, and as mentioned above the ribs were awesome, brisket was tasty but would have liked to have tasted it sliced, and the pork was good but not exceptional. Everything did have a very nice smoky flavor and a perfect crust, and I ate almost everything mostly dry, but added dashes here and there on my fork.  My wife ordered their big baked potato (cant remember what they call it) which was just huge and loaded with all sorts of goodness and brisket on top. It was very delicious and I think that they smoke rather than bake the potato but I could be wrong.  They take your order at the counter then bring it out to you when its ready. The service was okay but nothing great and they weren't particularly friendly at the counter, but they guy who brought out our food was pretty nice.  I will certainly eat here again, but at this point cant say that it is my overall favorite BBQ place. Their prices are actually pretty good for Vegas, and I think they give a discount to locals (which is a bit annoying).",

I loved the vinegar based sauce that went well with the wonderfully cooked meats.   My husband had. The three rib combo, and the meat was tender. Not exactly falling off the bone, but came off the bone cleanly, which I prefer.   The portions were ample and I would definitely return.",

This place delivers and then some. The pork was amazing. My picky 7 yr old loved her chicken.  Being a big guy I'm used to being able to\"put a hurting\" on some BBQ, but even I tapped out. Great portions and very friendly staff. Definitely going back before we leve Vegas.",

    "text": "Sweet. Fancy. Moses.  This place is amazing. I normally don't have a huge craving for BBQ, but maybe that's just because this town isn't especially known for it's fantastic BBQ. Rollin Smoke definitely changed that part of me. Since I first went there (about 3 weeks ago) I've been back 2 more times with a bunch of different people based on craving for that sweet magical BBQ they serve up. I feel like the more I eat there, the more wizard-like powers I will gain via BBQ sauce. Maybe I'm confusing that with my constant yearning for naps.  It is insanely delicious BBQ. Everything I've had there has been phenomenal. The pork, the chicken, and the burger...which I was unaware was insanely massive. I would recommend having the rest of your day planned for napping if you choose to eat the Outlaw Burger. It is tasty, but it is freaking enormous. It's got to weight a pound in your hands...It's a challenge to eat, but it's so good.  The sides are really great too. I keep trying new ones every time I go because they have a pretty significant list of options, so it's nice to switch it up and not be disappointed ever.  I really loved this place, and I really like the location. I know it's not the most convenient place on the planet, but getting there is easy, and it's kind of buried. Like a little local treasure. Places like these keep me exploring this city for more delicious dishes.  If I had any complaints about this place the only one would be that it can leave you smelling very smokey after you leave for quite some time. Not the worst problem if you're trying to get eaten by bears who like tasty things, but if you're going to a meeting with a new client or something immediately after, I might consider going in with a 'BBQ outfit' if that's even a thing.  It's tasty. Go eat it.",

The location was a bit sketchy being literally under two freeway overpasses. I ordered brisket, chicken, with a side of mac & cheese and bread. The chicken and the mac & cheese were ok but the brisket was downright bland, even with a little bit of glaze on it. I'd be willing to give this place a second and possibly order different, but as far as first impressions go, I was not impressed.",

    "text": "Tried Rollin Smoke tonight on friend's recommendation.  It was okay.  The sauce was good (on the thin side as you'd expect for this style) with just a hint of sweet.   I had the duo plate with brisket, hot link and jalapeno coleslaw.  The brisket was good, flavor and smoke wise.  The hot link was the worst I've ever had, it had so much connective tissue that I couldn't chew it and ended up looking like the clown with the never ending scarf being pulled out of my mouth (eeewwww, and not attractive, right???),  The coleslaw was fairly flavorless; as I would eat it the heat would gradually build but nothing other than that.  Husband had the pit special; brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, hot link, hush puppies, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  He agreed with my assessment on the brisket and the hot link.  He liked the hush puppies but felt the mac & cheese and the collard greens were WAY over cooked and lacking flavor.  Sister had the pulled piggy with hush puppies.  She said the pork was moist, tender, and had a good flavor.  She liked the hush puppies but they were a touch spicy for her.  It was worth a try but I can't say that we'll be back.",

On the side I got greens mashed potatoes and fries. It was done pretty quick. about 10 minutes. The ribs were pretty good. The hot link was spicy but not hot. Same goes for almost every thing else but the ribs fries brisket. I'm guessing they cook it earlier and warm it up I am not sure. I am pretty sure it was not fresh. Fries where just ok. Greens the same. Mashed potatoes where a little better. If i were to go back i would definitely probably just get ribs or a brisket or chicken sandwich. Sides taste like something on the strip. Over priced and over rated. The BBQ I would try again. Also there Ice tea wasn't that great either.",

    "text": "The food steals the show in this restaurant.   Due to the popularity with the locals, the establishment is under strain to keep up.  Food: 10/10 - This is where this establishment shines.  True barbeque.  The brisket and ribs have smoke rings in the meat and the building smells great when you walk in.   Great value!   You get a lot of food for not a lot of money.    Served on white bread just like BBQ should be!    Service: 7/10 - The kitchen really cares about what they are serving.  However the ordering process is under strain to keep up with the largely local patrons who visit.  The line frequently stretches out the door and with one person taking orders the wait can be longer than it takes to eat the food.    The person taking the  orders is friendly and trying hard to keep up but the management needs to improve the infrastructure.  The podium itself is very simplistic and the whole setup is not build to handle a crowd.  Decor: 5/10 - They have a fish tank featured on the tv show \"Tanked\" but it is in sad shape.  The restaurant is worn out and a bit unorganized comprising of 3 disjointed eating areas.   The eating areas look like they were expanded to meet demand but in an adhoc manner.  Cleanliness: 7/10 -  The area to get your sodas is sub par.  Poor lighting and hidden for first time visitors.   There were no major areas of uncleanliness but the restaurant was not beaming with cleanliness either.   Some improvement is needed.  Parking: 6/10 - Parking can be tight.  Small shared lot.   Note: You are in strip club central in this area.  Restrooms: N/A - Didn't visit.  Overall: 9.5/10 - Don't bother with BBQ on the strip.  This is a local gem if you can go at off peak times or don't mind waiting for your food.    The food is what brings the locals here and for good reason.   The problems that this establishment faces are good problems to have.  Namely, they are growing fast and are in a phase where they should be planning their next phase of development.  They are in need of a re-haul on the building itself to bring the eating area into one cohesive place with a modern order taking setup.  If they can overcome these obstacles there's no end in sight to the good things that lie ahead at Rollin' Smoke BBQ.",

I ordered the catfish and shrimp sampler and was highly disappointed, lack of flavor to the max! Shrimp is my favorite and I left 4 on the plate and I didn't eat the rest of the catfish either. The waffle fries are bomb and my friend said the collards were delicious. The banana pudding was not good at all. It was the consistency of baby food, not creamy at all and only 2 nilla wafers for decorations. Sorry Rollin Smoke, I was rooting for you but I will not return!",

Luckily we did because by the time we got there, they ran out of almost everything. .. and this was at 5:00 pm.  The sauce they give I believe is adequate for the amount we ordered.   Just in case,  we ordered more but ended up not needing to use it.   My hubby is also a big time spicy eater so we ordered a side of their spicyest sauce and he said it was hella spicy.  I loved the collard greens as the side.  Like I said,  I'm not a bbq person but this place earns the best I've tried.",

Before we even left, saw another large party arrive to be disappointed by locked doors as well.  Be there BEFORE 8PM!!!

Was hungry and ready to eat after a long day of work, Rollin Smoke is now up at the top of my list for BBQ. I had the trio combo with chopped brisket, pulled pork, and 2 spare ribs with a Mac and cheese side. The brisket was a bit too much pepper for me, but the house sauces were a great compliment to balance it out. The ribs were good too, nice smoky taste and not overpowering. I ended up throwing some of the brisket in the Mac and cheese to offset the amount of cheese and tang up the straight forward Mac and cheese side I had.   Overall the meats are enough to attract any BBQ lover a few blocks away from the strip. Will be back and be trying some of the other sides, but the meatloaf platter was calling my name and plan on that the next time.",

    "text": "This place is all its cracked up to be! We looked up best BBQ in Vegas and after some debate/argument we agreed to eat here. Rolling up you might want to turn around, but dont! This place is the real deal! The inside is not that fancy, but who cares right as long as the food is legit. I would pride myslef as a BBQ snob and this joint hit all the marks. I walked up ordered the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, tri tip and ribs. Couldn't decide on the sides so just ordered some extras like okra, cole slaw, waffle fries and potato salad and boy was that a mistake afterwards. I needed to be wheeled out! This has to be one of the best BBQ joints I have been to outside the rib cook off in Reno and this place has every right to stand off to any National Rib Champion. What sealed the deal for me was the owner and his customer service. This guy was hustling all over the restaurant checking on tables making sure everyone had what they needed. They missed a side off our order and I offered to pay for it and he refused. At another table someone asked how good something was on the menu he brought them out a sample! This doesn't happen in most places today or the level of customer service.  Then to top it off we meet this nice family while we are eating and they talk us into sampling their banana pudding desert. At first I was like no way I to full then my daughters almost refused to leave before trying so I gave in. This thing put me over the edge but wow was it good! similar to ice cream pudding only fills the cracks when your full...well worth trying or taking some home. This is a must when your in Vegas!",

    "text": "When you think BBQ what do you think of? Famous Daves? Lucilles? Memphis bbq? I was confused for many years thinking that these three were the best of Las Vegas in terms of BBQ, guys listen closely.  ROLLIN SMOKE, BEST BBQ IN VEGAS!!!  Location: Its funny when i tell people where this place is located since its in that desolate strip on highland near the Spearmint Rhino. Initially people are turned off, \"you're taking me where?\"  \"Han take me back\"  but once they have the food they go, \"omg... Han pleaseeee take me back here\"  Service: Service here is great.  They try their best to get the customers orders as fast as they can despite being busy during the peak hours of the day.  Another big plus about this place is that the chef will come out when he has time to ask his customers how the food is and a brief history of the restaurant.  Nothing like the person who makes the food to really care about what the customers think, bravo!  Food:  You really can't find anything bad to choose from but i'd avoid the brisket (a bit dry when i had it last time i was here)  Their famous outlaw burger is literally the size of your head.... like a mondo burger (good burger reference).  So juicy and literally will leave you so full, you won't be able to eat till tomorrow.  BBQ: BEEF RIBS!!! that is all.  Literally picked it up and the whole piece fell off.  St louis ribs are also very delicious and juicy.  Meat is so succulent and the juices that exude out of the meat is parallel to wringing a wet sponge.  I might just pass out from describing how good the ribs are.  Overall. Just go here!",

You have a customer (one that bought a rack of ribs no less) that didn't ask how much but do you have. And then we walked away with 3 containers of food and didn't have any bags??! So then we get to the end of the line and cups had no lids! The kid workin the end of the line had no clue what was going on and left the lid on the beans open so flies were swarming around. It's sad that I've wanted to try these guys for some time and this experience will sadly deter me back to Dickeys BBQ. Sorry. Some people will pay more for service and I'm one of those people.",

It may seem pricey, it may seem like the quantity of beef ribs seem nominal, but these beasts are  HUGE, and you taste the love put into making them, I guarantee you!   Another complaint I have with most BBQ places is that they've just defaulted to doing a BBQ sauce so ridiculously sweet, you might as well just drown your ribs in maple syrup like it's a pancake.  But Rollin' Smoke specializes in my favorite--the vinegar-based savory sauce, which just launches this most tender of beef ribs into orbit on your tastebuds!",

    "text": "Came here on a rainy friday afternoon with Doriee, at 1pm, hoping to run into the Travel Channel filming crew. We did, but apparently filming started at 11 instead of the posted time of noon (oh well). We met up with Roger, as well as invited one other friend.   Location, actually not as hard to find as i had thought. Though i had \"scouted\" the place a few days prior, still wasn't hard as some may have said. Coming from Fashion Show or Mel Tourne, taking a right onto industrial, then left at the light, then right again, and you are pretty much there !   Restaurant is a little small but lots of seating. Parking wise, decent amount. Unless there was some specific thing going, should be parking avail.   Upon entry, first thing you see is their huge menu on the wall. Since Doriee was on break and didn't want to eat too much, we decided to share. And being \"marketed\" the beef rib so much by Roger (steak on a stick is what he calls it), we opted to get the Rib Platter Special. Comes with one side and a drink. For the side, we got the corn nuggets ! Or rather Doriee \"excitedly\" shouted corn nuggets XD ! Since she was on her lunch break (1 hour time, but work was close by), we hoped it wouldn't take long. Upon ordering, we were told about 25 minutes.   Rib Platter Special - $17.99 - 3 Baby Back Ribs, 2 Spare Ribs, and 1 Beef Rib - Ordered with a side of Corn Nuggets.   To our surprise, it came in about 20 minutes or less. Good on timing !! :D  Pretty big platter. Was definitely a good sharing size between the two of us. Corn nuggets were piled on the side. To our surprise (again), the corn nuggets were pretty good. Corn gave it a nice sweetness and it was nice and crispy ! The sauce it comes with is like a mix between thousand island and like the sauce from Raising Canes. Sweet, little tangy.   Now the main entree. Ribs. The so-called \"steak on a stick\" was a beef rib that had a lot of meat on it, as well as a pretty thick layer of fat. The meat was not how i imagined it to be. Yes, as the restaurant name suggests, smokey, definitely a lot of smokey flavor (lasted the rest of the day lol!) but the meat broke off like it was stewed meat? I'm not sure if its because beef ribs weren't one of my favorite type of rib or its been too long since i had a beef rib but it was quite disappointing. Flavor was decent but meat texture wise, a little different. Both the baby back ribs and spare ribs were, yet again, smokey, but to our disappointment again, it was quite dry. Would have preferred it to be a little more seasoned/marinated to give it a nice flavor instead the meat but the dryness of the meat kind of made it saddening. Tried to help it with the bbq sauce on the table, but didn't really help.   The BBQ sauce was a very thin sauce, so if you were to put in on anything, it almost rolls right off. Flavor wise, sweet, tangy, spicy. Not bad but not my favorite either.   The following two items were ordered by Roger and another friend but im just putting what i SEE :P   The Outlaw Burger - $8.99 - Brisket, Onion, Bell Pepper, Onion Strings, Red Cabbage Slaw, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, and Chipotle Aioli  HUGE burger. The burger is, i believed a confirmed 1lb patty with tons of stuff stacked on top. Roger tried to press it down to make it smaller to eat, but to no avail. That burger was DENSE ! Not too much of a burger person but looked pretty good ! Maybe could try, if it was split with someone half n half..   Brisket Dog - $8.99 - 1/4 Lb Beef Hot Dog, Brisket, Smothered in Cheese and Onion Strings  I didn't even notice the hot dog in it until after my friend bit into it. Similar to the burger, ingredient filled/stacked. I was actually surprised my friend ate it fairly cleanly without everything falling out and onto the plate.   Desserts !!!  Southern Peach Cobbler & Country Black Berry Cobber - sweet and flavorful. sauce was very thin and runny. kind of hard to eat (especially if you were sharing. would prefer the sauce to be a little thicker. still pretty good !   Mama's Banana Pudding - imagine a bread pudding but instead of bread, its vanilla wafers... with slices of banana and pudding. Yummy dessert :P   Reese's PB Cup Bread Pudding - soaking in a RUM sauce, the dense but flavorful bread pudding is like hell on a plate. bread pudding usually is already pretty flavorful from it absorbing the heavy cream but in this case, it is a PEANUT BUTTER CUP bread pudding... rich peanut butter taste with a nice rum sauce glaze on top. Prob my fav on the 4 desserts listed.   Overall. good place. though the ribs were a bit disappointing. Everything else was pretty good. Would like to try other things, like their brisket and such",

The meatloaf, onion strings and outlaw burger were tasty.  The best thing we had were the corn nuggets - fried creamy goodness!  Mac and cheese and loaded mash were ok.  Desserts had so much potential but didn't deliver.  Their sundae was ice cream with a little choco sauce on top, nothing else.  Banana pudding and peach cobbler were meh.  If you do go, don't have too high of expectations based on Yelp.",

The pulled pork and corn fritters were really good, and I love there bbq sauce, but I really didn't care for the hot links or mac n cheese. I do want to go back and try some of the more recommended items.   To end on a high note, their customer service and hospitality was awesome!

Today was a down day and the 1st time was a better day.  I was at a 3.5 after the 1st time and gave it a 4, today it earned it's three.    Had the rib combo 3 baby back,  2 spare, 1 beef. The beef rib came out sauced,  I didn't expect that as it didn't last time.  I sent it back and asked for one without sauce. When I got the plate back it was the same rib with sauce rubbed off. This was highly irritating. Wonder what else was done to my food while it was sent back.  I don't dare to let my mind wonder that road.  I should have been served a new rib that had never been sauced.  Not one that was wiped off. Sigh, urg, I seem to be more upset about this the more I think about it. The beef rib was good this time not as good as the 1st time.  The baby backs were better than the spare but both were underdone as neither pulled away from the bone easy and were kinda tough, even though they had good flavor. Definitely not as good as the 1st time.   The 1st time I also had the brisket which was above average but not great.  Also had pulled pork that was pretty good.    All the meats here do have varying degrees of a Smokey taste,  as well varying degrees of smoke rings.  So they are cooking these meats with the right methods.    For sides I have enjoyed the corn nuggets and fritters both times, but I am not sure if these are not just prepackaged items instead of homemade.   Last but not least the desserts. I had the berry cobbler today.  I would definitely stay away from this item as it wasn't very good.  Ordering the peach cobbler and banana pudding seem like your safest and tastiest bets for dessert.   In summary if this was my 1st time it would be my last time. Still can't believe I didn't get a fresh rib instead they just wiped it off. If this would have been my 1st time they would have been 2 stars based just on that fact alone. Not sure if I will stop back in here or not.  On a good day they are the best in the area. (Really no good bbq in Vegas, so thats not saying much (though I have one that just popped on my radar that I need to try), ). On a bad day well it is just okay.   Your milage may vary.",

The coleslaw was ok, expected something more, what with being advertised as chipotle. BBQ beans were a HUGE disappointment. Nice level of sweetness (not too), but the meat they put into it was pulverized, had a consistency of almost like ground beef. The beans came across as a poorly executed chili.  So, been here, done that. Not going to make a special visit in the future. If in the area again, will maybe try some other combination: maybe caught them on an off day.",

The sandwich was very good, but the hot link was very spicy so be prepared for that. The mac and cheese was meh. We also shared a rib tip platter with bacon potato salad. This was good also.

The loaded mashed potatoes were yummy and the collard greens were a pleasant surprise.  I don't like most people's collard greens and I have to say they were the best I have ever had at a restaurant.  They had a smokey flavor from the brisket that they were cooked with.

I usually get their combo plate with brisket, chicken, and their fried okra. If I'm feeling ambitious I'll get some mac and cheese on the side too. I love their different options for BBQ sauce and how the meat tastes so good by itself that you only need the smallest amount to amp it up a bit. They also offer an all you can eat, but I can barely make it through a combo platter so I don't think I'll ever order it. However, if you have a big appetite I would highly recommend the AYCE.",

It wasn't until my food came out and I had a bite without the sauce that I understood exactly why I should do the same as the business suit guy. Their barbecue sauce is really good. I wish I could bathe in that sauce. Not really that would be gross but you understand the sentiment. 5 stars for that sauce.  They have $7.99 or $8.99 deals and even offer all you can eat barbecue. I ordered the $7.99 trio sliders and got chicken, brisket, and pork. It was so tasty. Presentation is aesthetically pleasing meaning the food is good looking. I do mind that the meat was colder than usual at room temperature or even a little colder. Food should come out piping hot so that once the customer decides to dig in, the food will still be extremely warm and fresh. 3 stars for the food.  The people working there are super cool. We were asked how our food was tasting too many times by 3 different workers. 5 stars for the service.  Setup of the restaurant is weird. The ordering counter is inside one of the dining rooms so the line wraps around the dining tables so if you sit on those dining tables it'd be awkward. There's a connecting room with dining tables and me and my 2 friends avoided sitting on those dining tables by the line so that we sat at a table meant for 2. 2 on the bench and 1 on the chair, 2 shared one end of the table. There are outdoor dining in the front but no one wants to sit in the 100 degree Las Vegas summer weather. It wasn't until we were about to leave that I saw a separate dining table accessible from the outdoor dining on the left side of the restaurant. There could be signs inside the main dining area pointing out that there's that other separate dining room.. Or maybe I'm just oblivious? 2 stars for the restaurant setup.",

    "text": "Rollin Smoke Barbeque is the epitome of what a BBQ joint should be. My roommate and I came here to satisfy our BBQ fix, and were actually really impressed.   When we first arrived, it was busy and no one was at the counter for a while. However, the wait was well worth it because Rollin Smoke Barbeque beats out all the chain BBQ places in Vegas.  Inside, there are two dining rooms with one of the rooms being where you order. The rooms fill up quickly when it's busy so if you want to dine-in, try finding a seat first. There are also a few wooden picnic tables outside for outdoor seating.  As for the food, I ordered the trio choice plate with a side of fried okra and an a la carte order of cornbread.  The trio choice plate was your pick of 3 meats (out of: brisket, pork, 1/4 chicken, 2 spare ribs, or a hot link). Everything about my order was on point. The pork was soft and succulent, with a tenderness that made it practically melt in your mouth. The brisket was probably the highlight of the trio platter. Whenever I go to BBQ places, they usually end up burning some of the brisket, but it was perfect here. Savor these tender cuts of meat because it's THAT good. As for the chicken, it was a little on the pink side, but the parts I did eat had a smokey BBQ flavor. (Don't be afraid to literally drench your food in the BBQ sauce they have on the table!) The fried okra were little bite-sized pieces of heaven. The cornbread wasn't dry like most places; it had a good texture with the classic, sweet cornbread taste.  The parking lot to this place is on the small side and it can get awkward getting into if you're not alert, but who would've thought that this little treasure would be in the midst of all the plumbing and electrical buildings nearby.   Rollin Smoke is a meatlover's dream. If you want BBQ done right, you should definitely go here.",

The Rib Sampler comes with 3 Spare Ribs, 3 Small Baby Back Ribs, and 1 Beef Rib (plus the extra Beef Rib), a slice of white bread, 2 pickle chips and 1 side.  I got their Bacon Potato Salad. My review:  It wasn't their best, maybe it was because I got there post lunch rush.  The pork ribs were well past done.  They were FALL OFF THE BONE.  Ok, folks, even though FALL OFF THE BONE is touted as it being the \"BEST\", in Barbecue Judging Circles, FALL OFF THE BONE means it is OVERDONE.  When you take a bite, there should be some bite and the meat should come off with just a little resistance and should not leave a clean shiny bone behind.  If you take a bite and the whole bone slips out it is overdone.  But my score 0-9 on the ribs today 6.  The Beef ribs, they on the other hand were overdone to the point that there were portions that were dry and tough and again, they even put them in the tray in pieces because they fell apart.  Not, so good, score: 4. I thought the potato salad was one of my favorites, but this time, for my liking it had too much mustard, the potatoes were a little firm and the sauce was watery and staring to separate.   Now for my biggest complaint, seems that there is a trend in BBQ places that they are making the sauces real thin.  I'm not sure if they are cutting corners and costs and putting more water in the sauce to stretch it out, but when you put it on your rib and it runs off like water, it isn't a good thing.  Again, maybe this was just a one off for this visit, I'll try it again, mainly to try the BEEF RIB as not all places have them.",

    "text": "First off, The food here was extremely dry with no bbq sauce AT ALL! And on the notes section I had provided specific instructions and still no attention to detail. What's the point of even requesting anything in the notes section since they don't even care or do what you ask? Waste of time and energy. And it's not cheap. Every order is between $50-$80. More than a normal plate at Lucille's BBQ. If only this place would get better management and employees that pay attention to detail, I wouldn't mind paying the high prices for this dry meat provided I get a side of bbq sauce. This is just saddening that the employees and management don't care. Last time I'll be ordering from here.",

I don't eat pork because I am allergic, but he said it was delicious   I tried their chicken and the meat was very tender and well cooked. From the sides we tried the corn tots which were yummy  sweet and crispy, the chili beans were good too but they had too much pepper corn and you could taste it, and corn bread was very soft and buttery it almost dissolved in your mouth . Overall I'd give it a 4.5. The could make the beans with less peppercorn to my personal taste. But we will definitely return when we come back to Vegas!",

There was plenty of seating and it's off the beating path from the strip approx 20 minute walk. After all I would not miss an opportunity to come here if your in town.

    "text": "They unquestionably have some of the best BBQ I've ever had. So, if that's all you care about, read no further.   However, on Wednesday I ordered a five meat platter for my wife & I for our thanksgiving, along with a half chicken. The total was around $45.  I was asked if I wanted some sauce with my order...  Well, yeah, of course I do: 'I'll take a little of each,\" I said.   Not only did RS charge me extra for the three sauces, they were half full. I was able to use them on my pulled pork & chopped brisket. However, my chicken, hot links & ribs went without -- essentially wasted.  Now, not only did RS charge me for sauce without telling me, NONE of the three small containers were complimentary. They gave me zero sauce on a $45 order. An order I intended to use for my Thanksgiving meal. That's a 1/4 chicken, a 1/2 chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and hot links with zero sauce included.   Unfortunately, with no sauce, I scrapped those plans and went to Bachanal at Caesars.  I have one issue and one issue only with RS: they do not seem to genuinely care about their customers. They do great business, they are always busy and they clearly take that for granted. Their prices are already astronomically high, but to not include sauce (and when you do, you charge without telling, and still come up short) is just bad business. It goes beyond just being 'cheap'; it's a slap in the face.  Rollin Smoke is certainly making money. They've raised their prices by at least 15% in two years . Yet, they're too cheap, or they care too little, to complete their meals.   It's unfortunate because it doesn't need to be so difficult. Sometimes, it's the little things that make all the difference.   EDIT: 4/29/17 -- still haven't been back. I was at the Great American Foodie Fest at Sunset Station last night & just shook my head walking by the RS stand.",

    "text": "Yeah. I love it.  Why?   Good food, good prices and they have one of the gnarliest burgers I have ever seen.  Additionally, the food tastes excellent too.  The burger is little excessive on the onion strings but I'll take it anyway.  It's definitely bursting with flavor.  So this place has been on my radar ever since I saw the pictures of the Outlaw Burger.  Since I love burgers, I had to make it here when I was in the area.  Luckily, I finally had that chance.  So with no hesitation, I walked in, stepped up to the counter and proudly, enthusiastically and anxiously as hell, ordered the Outlaw Burger...with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and cornbread.  After only a few minutes (maybe 10 at the most but probably considerably less) the server delivered my order.  The Outlaw Burger is a monster!  The thing is probably about a foot tall, mostly onion strings but the actual meat and cheese portion of the burger is delicious.  The only downside is that halfway through the thing was falling apart and I pretty much had to eat it like a salad.  I'm not going to complain though because the thing was delicious.  The loaded mashed potatoes were a worthy addition to the meal and really hit the spot.  The sweet cornbread wasn't too bad but I probably would have ordered the corn nuggets or whatever they were called next time given the amount and since I've had sweeter, tastier cornbread before from my local grocer (in Rollin' Smoke's defense, I've yet to find better cornbread outside this particular grocer).  Service was good, the food arrived quickly and it hit the spot for sure.  For an off the beaten path little BBQ joint, this place has it going on.  I'm already thinking about eating here again, the only thing keeping me is a few hundred miles...at least for now.    I'll be back.",

He texted back,  \"Neither. ..\"  At the same time, William of LA messaged that he hadn't had a chance to go to Rolling Smoke Barbeque...ah...how to decide?   Shall I explore for William?  Why not?   My GPS took me down some road that I have never heard of or been on. It seemed like I was in an industrial area.  I saw a sign with the name of the restaurant clumped up with other businesses. I pulled in the driveway. There were two police cars already parked there.  I messaged William about the location. He said there are strip clubs in the area.  \"Thanks!\", I messaged back.  A little worried, I walked in anyway.   The place was about half full and I stood in line to order. The cashier, Dave, was very friendly and helpful. I decided to get the Platter which had 3 baby back ribs, 2 St. Louis spare ribs, and one beef rib.  Then I had to select a side dish. I figured that I knew what Mac and cheese was about, so I got the Corn Nuggets.  Yes, I didn't know what that was either. ..  Dave said that it's Sweet Corn,  breaded, and deep fried. Intriguing!  Let's try it!  Then, Dave give me a cup. I asked if this meal came with a free drink because I noticed that the drinks are $3 with refills.  No... I got a complimentary beverage!  Yay! Thanks Dave!  The soda dispenser is self service! !  I guess I was supposed to sit down and have the meal brought to me.  The other room had a table occupied by police officers. I sat in the corner, under the television. Another option was outside seating, but it was dark and cold. I left my jacket in the car, prepared to battle some ribs. ..  The Beef Rib was on the top. I couldn't stop eating it. The moist meat fell off the bone. It was like smokey, soft, stew meat. The charred \"koge\" fat layer on the top was scrumptious! I wanted to give equal attention to the baby back ribs and the St. Louis spare ribs, but I couldn't let go of that Beef Rib. It was that good!  Later, I realized that I ate everything without sauce. There were containers on the counter, but I was so mesmerized that I stayed in my seat. I got up for a soda refill and a take out container & package which are self service along with utensils.  I wasn't able to finish everything in one sitting,  so I brought it to my hotel room and had a perfect midnight snack! The only thing that might turn some customers off would be a cockroach. I saw one crawling across the wall at the entrance of the restaurant. However, I'm not going to let this get in my way of a BBQ meal.  I would go back again!",

Gone is the mom and pop feel and the prices have increased accordingly and no longer a screaming bargain.  Some examples: they charge $3 for drinks, I could barely finish my meal before but now can so quite comfortably (but still is filling), I was never asked how my food was and when ordering, I was not given any suggestions or descriptions on their menu choices.  Ordered the meat trio $17.99:  Baby back ribs are not no longer fall off the bone and a bit dry.  The BBQ chicken is soft and tender but the smoky flavor and seasoning didn't sink into the meat.  The beef brisket is still pretty good but was chopped too much.  If you don't mind driving and for really good BBQ for dirt cheap prices, I suggest John Mull's in North Las Vegas.",

I'd eat these all day long if calories didn't count.  Two things I would change about Rollin Smoke if I could: the location (super small parking lot) and the seating arrangements. Unfortunately we came on a really cold day and the seating area is rather sparse. This resulted in the doors opening and closing a lot, so our food got cold pretty quickly.  Verdict: I do NOT plan on waiting another two years to return, so you shouldn't either.",

All of the meats were so tender and tasty, the sauces were delicious and just added to the flavor. We had some really tasty potato salad, and the best fried okra! We ordered some peach cobbler, warm with s scoop of ice cream and it was delicious too! This was the best BBQ we've had in a very long time! Who knew you could find authentic Southern BBQ in Las Vegas!",

I never really think of Arkansas as BBQ state but damn is it good ! I loved all the meat particularly the baby back ribs and brisket but I found myself using the meat as a vessel to all their awesome BBQ sauces to my mouth lol! All of them were good !",

Expensive, but not too bad if you split it with someone or even a couple of someone's.  With \"Loaded Mash\", collard greens, and chipotle coleslaw as our sides, my fellow field researcher and I ate our fill and still had quite a bit of leftover's.  That monster could easily feed 3 hungry hombre's.  Or my wife and daughter for a week.  I'd go again.  I just love me some good 'que now and again.  I'd be a bit more discreet in ordering though.  I think I could be satisfied with just the \"Outlaw\" burger or a half rack of the \"St. Louis Spare Ribs\".  I don't need the extra calories anymore.  That AYCE \"Anything On The Menu  Any Day, Any Time\" is now $34.99.  For others, the feeding frenzy continues.",

Ambiance: typical smokehouse feel  Service: the cashier was friendly, not a lot of service, it's like a fast food/ take out.   Went at 2:30pm on a Wednesday, there were still walk-in traffic but no line.  Food: order the platter of Brisket/ Chicken/ Pull Pork/ Sausage/ Rib and 2 sides of Mac n Cheese and Corn Nuggets w/ Sweet Tea.  Chicken was very moist and juicy w/ a hint of smoke. very good. Pull Pork was also very good Sausage goes well w/ the bread they serve, also very good. Rib: wasn't try, right amount of sweet but didn't like the raw green onion they sprinkle on top. they can take that out for all i care, but it was also very delicious. Brisket: totally chopped up and shredded into pull pork sizes. very peppery and flavorful but never had brisket like that before...  Both sides were solid and very good.   For the price, all that for $30 was reasonable for me as it was shared and we had plenty of leftovers.  Was very good for restaurant quality BBQ. Would def. come back and will crave whenever I'm in town.",

There is an overflow area to provide additional seating which is almost always being utilized due to how busy they usually are. We try to order something new every time we come, but we always order the Burnt Ends, and the creamed corn nuggets. The reason for only giving them 4 stars is because they don't offer fresh brewed Iced Tea. They have the fountain type that tastes terrible. Just my opinion, but I just feel like a barbecue restaurant should take the additional steps to brew the iced tea in house.",

To me, if it gets good reviews but looks like a hole in the wall, it HAS to be good! When we got there the guy taking our order was super nice and helpful. I ordered the meatloaf and my husband had the \"All you can eat\" for $34.99. The meatloaf was unbelievably delicious. Everything we tried was yummy.

This is a unique style found in these young business owner's local spin of ribs, chicken and even their signature Mac n Cheese. Although a bit removed from the Strip , this Chop Shop is rollin' right along to a bright future with their very low overhead and loyal following.",

These ribs come in at close to 3 pounds per rack! (two of us shared a rack and it was plenty... and we have big appetites) They are from huge HAWGS and are tender, delicious, loaded with meat, and did not have much residual fat. They are cooked nearly perfectly to a slight dryness. Use their BBQ sauce if you like. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed their sauce... one of the best ever.  Next visit will be for their Brisket Dog and the Outlaw Burger. If you didn't read my first review, let me say again that the Bacon Potato Salad and Corn Nuggets are also very good.",

My only complaint is that I couldn't find the street address listed on their website. It may have been that I was trying to read in the car, but actual street address or \"turn on this street to get here \" , I just couldn't find it. The little Google map helped, but we still got a little turned around. Hey, I'm old, it happens.   Just...go there, eat, be happy!",

I was SHOCKED at all the great reviews.  Is someone buying the Yelp reviews here?  Its seems insane they have so many 5 stars from people who claim to have traveled to good BBQ?  - BBQ was a little dry, seasoning ok.  2 out of 5 if you've had great BBQ and traveled the world. - WAAAAYYYYYYY over priced for portions and quality.  Did I mention WAY over priced.  $33 for a lousy small helping of ribs.   - Outlaw Burger?  Should be outlawed.  Horribly tiny and meat is awful.  Tastes like they put filler all in it of some time.  So gross meat I spit out one bite.  I dont know where that big burger they have on the Yelp photos is but thats not.  Bait and switch you ask me. - Only one BBQ sauce on the table - and liquidy weak. - We had 3 ketchup bottles completely empty.  Very old employee came round and just shrugged when we complained like \"owell.\" - Fake pretentious BBQ poise with a couple lame pickles and bad white bread ends. - No air in main eatery, side eatery for parties has air.  Who wants to eat in a muggy bbq joint in Vegas. - Bathroom, borderline poor.  The toilet seat had been pulled off so I guess if you where a woman or someone you just had to squat. - Super loud inside so noisy you cant talk or hear yourself think. - To top it off in a real dumpy part of town with crappy parking.  - Really comes off as some tourist trap judging by the price vs. quality.  Albeit the people where nice.",

Two people working the cash registers, but once we sat down our food took less than 5 minutes to arrive to our table. This place is LEGIT. Sadly, they were all out of brisket, so I ended up getting the pork, but I was NOT disappointed. The Arkansas BBQ Sauce was killer. Real smoky with a little spice too.

    "text": "Hmph. So I had quite a disappointing experience here, so I'm giving a lower star.   Here's what I had:    Out law burger- 5 star.  Meat is juicy and flavor is so rich and yummy. Share one with someone.    The pit Special (4 meats and 3 sides for $20) - brisket, pulled pork, 2 spare ribs, and since the hot links were out i subbed it with baby back ribs for extra cost.    Brisket was SOOOOOOOOO good. It was shredded up and looks just like the pulled pork to the point that my bf and I were trying to figure out which was which from our photo.  I didn't like the pulled pork (lacked flavor and was dry) and the spare ribs were okay.      Sides:  Hush puppies (meh), Corn nuggests (THE DEALIO IS HERE), and kickin beans (yes!)    My bf thought this place was so legit, we went back 2 days later. I asked at the front where you order SHOWING the photo of my original Pit Special plate and asked him which meat was brisket and which one was pulled pork. We wanted to get it right, because one was substantially better tasting than the other. And, it was confusing, since they looked exactly the same shredded up together. He told me that the one that I had liked was brisket.    SO, I order the brisket.  What do I get?  Sliced meat. It didn't look like anything from the photo i had shown or what I had eaten 2 days prior.  Not only did it look different, but It wasn't as juicy and didn't have the same texture.    I found out from the server that the brisket comes in two styles (shredded or sliced). It would have been nice for the guy that took the order to specify it for me if that's the case.  AND, I don't know how he can get it wrong after seeing a photo.     Not to mention, I ordered corn nuggets (cuz that's why i came back 2 days later) and when the server arrived at our table with our food, that was when I found out that they were out of corn nuggets. I had paid additional money for this side. So, I ask this guy how long it'll take to make them (because I was willing to wait for it) and the waiter told me \"several days.\"      My friend went there 2 hours later, and told me there were plenty corn nuggets. WTH dude. I woulda seriously waited 2 hours for my corn nuggets. Or come back in 2 hours for it. But I was told several days, and I was leaving the next day.     When you're a vegas native and can access a restaurant any day, probably these things don't matter. But, when you're a visitor, a foodie, and you pick a restaurant out of all the choices available, it's disappointing when you don't get what you ordered.     Next time I go, I shall ask for SHREDDED BRISKET. It's SHREDDED BRISKET versus a BRISKET, y'all!",

My husband had the beef ribs which were very meaty and delicious, I had the loaded baked potato with brisket which was equally delightful. The only complaint I had was that my husband asked 2 different employees for different sauces so he could try them and was left hanging, he finally got up and got them for himself. Overall though very good food and would return when I'm back in Vegas!",

This time it was nicely smoked with just the right amount of spice and flavor.  Meats well done and cooked well.  I wasn't that fond of the pulled pork, which seemed too salty but the other meats, ribs, beef and links were A OK.  But, this time the food was cold.  Not freezer cold, but it tasted like it had been sitting out on the counter way too long and was medium to medium minus warm.    If they could get the quality improved this place would rock in my view, but until then, I'll stay away until someone else I know wants to head over to Rolling Smoke.",

It's a hole-in-the-wall, underneath the highway, tucked in a tiny strip mall near Spearmint Rhino -- uh, yeah so you should have no trouble finding the place.   I had the 2-item combo, with the brisket and spare ribs. I also ordered an extra beef short rib. The only thing memorable was that giant beef rib. Tender, juicy, succulent and slightly sweet meat that came cleanly off the bone.  *Thumbs down* The brisket was slightly dry, and the spare ribs were bland. It desperately needed some of their house made BBQ sauce, which is super peppery.",

I was not disappointed at all. I shared the five meat platter with my son. Chicken, smoked polish sausage, brisket, pork rib, pulled pork, and three sides for $27. The greens were beyond passable for being from the south.  I left full and it didn't dent my wallet like many places in Las Vegas can. The topper is the service though. David took my order and got each of our names and shook all of our hands.  Southern Soul Food and hospitality all wrapped into one. A must eat in Las Vegas just don't expect the neon and glitz.

We ordered the BBQ sandwich pack, as illustrated on the website we were suppose to receive 1 pound of brisket, 1 pound of pork, and 1 pound of hot links. As a concierge service at one of the hotels on the strip we have access to a scale. So when we opened the box and it did not look like enough to feed 10-12 people we weighed the box. 1 pound in total for the weight of meat. When we tried to contact them no one answered and when we returned to store front we were greeted by Big Mike who did not care at all. We have frequently recommended customers to this business during NFR or when a guest is craving bbq. These recommendations will stop.",

    "text": "I consider myself a foodie, not just because I like to eat food and visit hunger satisfying restaurants, but also because I like to watch food television shows.  One television show on The Travel Channel is called Food Paradise, which featured the Best BBQ in America.  Rollin Smoke Barbeque in Las Vegas was one of the top ten restaurants featured on Food Paradise and I can personally attest that it lived up to its billing.  4.5 stars all day.  Rollin Smoke is located in an industrial part of Las Vegas not too far from the Strip and with the Trump Hotel overlooking this barbeque star of a restaurant.  There's really nothing else on the corner where Rollin Smoke sits except the restaurant itself.  Even having a late lunch/early dinner around 3:30pm didn't mean we escaped the popularity of this restaurant.  The parking is limited, so be prepared to park on the street or anywhere you can to get your mouth on this delicious BBQ.  Due to its popularity, it's great that Rollin Smoke can accommodate a good sized crowd.  It's a little confusing to figure where to start your order, but you'll have to stand in line, place your order, and then take your seat on the many picnic benched spread throughout three seating areas.  Rollin Smoke is owned by a family from Arkansas, which was obvious with many homages to the Arkansas Razorbacks throughout the decor complete with a Razorback hog head.  You can easily see that Rollin Smoke is award winning with trophies and framed positive reviews about the BBQ here.  I deducted half a star because it took some time for us to get our food, but it's also understandable because of the amount of people who flock to this BBQ mecca.  I ordered the Trio Choice Smoking Plate, which comes with your choice of three meats, a side, and a slice of bread.  I chose the brisket, 2 spare ribs, hot links, and a side of collard greens with brisket.  Everything was finger licking good.  Loved the spare ribs and hot links.  They were cooked right, hearty, and the meat was scrumptious.  I wanted more than the 2 ribs I got with my plate.  Make sure to try all of the sauces they have to douse your meat.  My fave two sauces were the spicy and House Arkansauce.  Their collard greens with brisket were the best I've ever eaten.  The greens were tender, juicy, and with the brisket, just pushed it over the top.  Last, but not least, Rollin Smoke's sweet tea was really good.  You don't have to be a foodie or watch food television shows to appreciate the outstanding BBQ Rollin Smoke has to offer.  If you love delicious food and want to leave a restaurant satisfied, then Rollin Smoke is a must eat, must visit location.",

I had the 3 meat platter- brisket, ribs, ribs so delicious, tender and melt in your mouth- add your favorite BBQ sauce- I love the Arkansas sauce. This will definitely not be our last visit.

It was close by and we wanted something to take out after spending 5 hours in the car driving from LA.  I have to say that I'm pretty finicky about BBQ because my wife is from Texas and I have sampled most of the best of the best there.  Rollin Smoke does well to hold it's own.  We ordered a pit special so we could try a little bit of everything.  All the meats were fantastic, although I preferred my brisket sliced as opposed to chopped.  The sides were pretty good and I did enjoy a drizzle of the spicy bbq sauce with each bite of meat.    Best of all, I thought that there prices were pretty reasonable for what you got.  I think we spent about $40 for three people and we had leftovers.  I would definitely eat here again on another trip.",

We had a very unconventional reception venue (Battlefield Las Vegas) but were very impressed with the presentation and food quality they were able to deliver. Everything was delicious and we were excited to have leftovers! It's hard to pick a favorite side dish but I'm partial to the corn nuggets! The BBQ also pleased the meat-lovers in our group. Even talking to the catering organizer prior to the event was such a relief. She made planning easy and was always very pleasant on the phone addressing any of our needs. I should give myself one star since I fail to remember the catering organizer and server's name. They were both excellent and we are grateful with having both their help in making our casual reception go smoothly. Thank you!",

Ithis indicated the place provided and was willing to provide any menu option substitute!        The pulled pork is juicy, tender and savory! Will return  for a pound of other meats!        The sauce is delicious! And bottles of it are available to take home!",

Told her it was our first time and she quickly offered us a menu which I like as a part of customer service. We came a perfect time to order because it got busy which is always a great thing & seeing that got me more excited as to knowing something(s) is good here and I wasn't wrong. We both ordered the Duo choice of 2 meats. Brisket and Spare Ribs which was amazingly good. Make sure to get the sweet country girl sauce for you meats, especially the Brisket. Will defiant be back and totally recommend this place for bbq meats. Thank you again!!!",

Let's start with the fact they have all the their drinks outside. They even have Sweet Tea, which is dangerous, because it's all you can drink every visit! Yup I am number one fan of sweet tea...  I like the fact that the menu is pretty easy to understand, but with all the yummy options I alway struggle on what to order, and when I finally decide what I want I usually always want something else. The good thing is when you go in a group or your family, you can sample everyone else's platter or sandwich!  So it's alway a win win win! This particular visit I got the Pull Pork, and it was amazing, I love how moist and soft the texture was.  I definitely love the sauces you can Squeeze on them to amplify the flavor. But the thing I LOVE the most about coming to this restaurant is the customer service, everyone is so sweet and helpful.  The last visit an associate by the name of Antonio, was super helpful and nice. I love the fact that he went out of his way to make sure everything was okay for me and my family, even when my son was having a moment because his food was touching the meat, Antonio went out of his way to grab him some Mac and cheese on the side without even asking us if that would help the situation, Antonio definitely made our visit a pleasant one!  High Five to Antonio for going out of his way to make me and my family's visit an awesome one!  We will definitely be back again and hopefully Antonio will be there to help make our experience awesome again!   Due to the moment my son was having I didn't have time to take pictures, but I will definitely be back again, and I will grab some shots of how amazing the food looks",

    "text": "Tried this place based on their reviews. Although not a total loss, I must be a bit harsher than the other raters on yelp apparently.   The Good-  I love that this place is in a small little strip mall that is off the strip. Its Decorated nicely. I didn't catch the ladies name that took our order but her customer service was top notch! The prices for the food were where they should be with the exception of desert. Their BBQ sauce is to die for. The portions were good sized also. The sweat tea was on point.   The Bad-   We ordered burnt ends. Our expectation was that they would be somewhat burnt. They weren't. The first order was pretty fatty and not really burnt at all. We sent them back. What came back was a tad bit better. Ultimately they were just too fatty. I know that you will get fat with burnt ends but typically it is balanced by the burnt more chewy part of the meat. Unfortunately they didn't meet our expectation. We ordered a side of loaded mashed potatoes to go along with the meal. I feel like they were instant with a possible potato mashed up in them. They weren't terrible but they certainly weren't great. The only other comment I have is that she should find another place for the drink station and condiment stand. It is in the main room that also houses the checkout which makes it very congested when trying to get something to drink, utensils, or leaving the restaurant.   Over all I gave it 3 stars which I thought was fair. I would give it a whirl once more time but would try some other meat entree.",

Its called the SMOKED MEAT LOAF  it has ground pork and beef and I believe smoked brisket. It sits on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with fried onions.   Its was a perfect combination of flavors on every bite. You had chunks of different type of meats with the creaminess of the mash and the saltiness of the onions. I also got the mac and cheese(YUM!)  As for the BBQ, it being two boys from ARKANSA that opened up the place the bbq isn't your typical thick sauce type. It's more of a  RUNNY consistency FULL of flavor.   The drinks are self serve and so are the sauces TRY THEM ALL!.   Customer service. GREAT. I don't rate on CS but do provide it in order for you to know what you're getting yourself into.  CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT MY SISTER TO GO BACK AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE IN THE MENU.",

When you first get out of the car you nose is accosted with this amazing smoker scent, I was already mouth watering before we got inside.   The menu has a lot going on but Lizelle was awesome in helping me to narrow down between my various choices. I ended up getting the trio with pulled pork, ribs and burnt ends. The burnt ends are an upgrade but they are very clear to tell you that when you order and they were definitely worth it. You know the BBQ is good when you don't even need the sauce cause the meat has so much flavor and is so juicy on it's own. Big big big big fan.   Went for a drink as well and it came in a souvenir cup so that was a nice surprise.   The cornbread is almost like sheet cake and it is so damn good, the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness and I can't wait to bring my Mac and Cheese loving man back to try it.  Ended the meal with banana pudding and well I am already planning my trip back.   I mean when we walked out the door and smelled the smoker again and it still smelled appetizing that's a good sign.   My leftovers reheated really nicely as well!   I love this place and cannot stop talking about it.",

An excellent wood smoke permeates all meats. I have found it very hard to find a beef rib outside of the South, let alone an excellent one. The sides were straight up and very enjoyable, as were the desserts. I'm not a big baby back rib guy, so I was surprised at how much i loved the dry rub ribs here. Perfect. The staff was very friendly and the prices are great. Can't really say anything bad about this place.",

Visually, it's no beauty and it's not on the most beautiful street in town. HOWEVER, they're putting out some of the best BBQ you've ever tasted.   I went with the burnt ends brisket, hot links, and waffle fries. For dessert I got peach cobbler a la mode.   The guy at the checkout counter (Dave) was unbelievably nice. Even though the line was long he took the time to give me suggestions specific to what I like and what id ordered. So matched the best sides with my meats. The wife went with brisket chopped and yams. Everything was GREAT.   The sweet tea is housed in Nestea containers so I thought it was going to be the syrup mixed with water. But I watched them pouring brewed sweet tea into the top. Impressed!   The dessert was good but I would say that in the future I won't get the ice cream inside on top. I think it may have taken away from the deliciousness of the cobbler.   Regardless, I highly recommend this place.",

It was impossible to eat it without taking it apart. The meat was fantastic and all the ingredients were wisely chosen and harmonized well.

The lady says it will be ready in 15 minutes. I get there at 5:45pm so the food should be ready. I stand in line to pay. After I pay, I stand next to the register and wait for my food to come out.  As I'm standing there about 15 minutes, the people who ordered after i paid start getting their food.   I ask a girl working there, \"why are people who ordered after me getting their food before me when I called in my order over half an hour ago?\"  She asked for my name, then went in the back and comes back out with my bag like it was just sitting there the whole fricken time!!!   Then she says, \"it's because you didn't tell anyone.\"  WTF are you talking about, I paid the F'n cashier for my damn food without talking to him!!!??? He knows what I paid for, that it was a pick up order, and what I was standing there for.  What a joke...",

    "text": "Pretty damn tasty bbq.  Came here with 5 friends and we were hungry for some good bbq. We ordered 3 lbs of brisket, 1.5 slabs of spare ribs, a slab of beef ribs, and some sides of potato salad, mac n cheese, onion strings, and corn balls.    We ordered all the meats dry and with sauce on the side and also asked for their spicy bbq sauce.  The test for good bbq is how their meat tastes without sauce.  This place definitely passed the test  I'm not usually a fan of bbq sauce anyway, but this place definitely does not need sauce.  The rub they use on their meats were delicious.  The beef rib was so nice and fatty and it basically melts in your mouth.  The flavor of the spare ribs were good too.  However, the meat on spare ribs should easily fall of the bone, and these did not.    The sides were ok.  I liked the bacon potato salad.  I wasn't a fan of the other stuff. Although my friends really liked the corn ball things.   Definitely worth a shot, but it can be busy.  Some of the other reviews said it was hard to get a seat.  I can definitely see that happening on the weekends during peak hours.  We went on a monday at 6pm.  There was a line for the food, but we didn't have any problem finding a table.  However, as we were there, the place filled up and the line got much longer.",

    "text": "Well, I have tried most things they have here. Good ribs, brisket and the burgers are unlike any burger I have had. I am a fan of smoked and/or grilled burgers, but fried not at all..like  Mcdonalds, Wendy's, In-N-Out... RS burgers are big and soft and smoked. If you are a burger fanatic, you should at least try it. But, what I think about when I think of this place is the beef ribs. One rib is a whole meal, they are so big. The beef rib is tender, tasty and totally trimmed of excess fat and gristle. This is the must-try from this place. Beef ribs. Amazing and I want to know how they do that (I'm a cook)! The only issue is finding the place, so head south on Highland from Sahara for about a mile, then you will see it tucked into a little strip-mall. The wait is not short, which is why I only give it 4 stars.",

    "text": "Definitely way too much hype for this place. I went once and it was OK. Will not return.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and, unfortunately, had small chunks of bone in it. Nothing huge, but come on...that's not supposed to happen. The meat is tasteless and you are forced to douse with sauce to get any meaningful flavor.   Also, the prices are pretty steep. You get the pulled pork sandwich for just under $10 (not a problem), but then you must pay an extra $4 for combo/drink (problem)! So, lunch for one person is nearly $15! Too much for BBQ.  Good proximity to the strip, though. However, the area can be sketchy at night.  Once you've had authentic Texas BBQ, it's tough to meet that standard again and this place doesn't even come close.",

    "text": "So I am very glad that I went to this establishment.  It is definitely off the strip which was nice in itself.  The option for the all you can eat is a little dubious.  There is a one hour time limit and it starts once you pay for your meal.  My other issue that I have is that when I paid for the meal, the cashier told us to either come up to the register and they would take another order OR we could order it with one of the food runners.  Well when I tried to use the food runner option, I was told to go to the register.  Ask when my friend tried to buy a hat, the cashier said that he could try it on but would have to go to the office at a later time.  My friend then asked one of the runners about the hat and was informed that he would have to get back in line and wouldn't have to go to the office.  The people were not on the same page.  But I digress.  Now the food was freaking delicious.  The brisket was juicy and tender.  The dirty rice and corn nibblets were awesome.  I think the price of 34.99 was worth it. Just be transparent and on the same page.",

My husband and I ordered the \"Pit Special\" to share, which included 5 types of meat (pulled pork, chicken, brisket, hot links and 2 ribs) and your choice of 3 sides for $27.99. It was plenty of food and we loved getting to try each of the meats. The brisket was Hands down the best. For our sides, we ordered the dirty rice, loaded mashed potatoes, and corn bread. We LOVED every single side. The chick at the register (Brenda) was so warm with all her \"hey honey's\" and \"of course baby\". Then the girl who served us (Lizelle?) was so incredibly helpful and sweet, offering to help us take our selfie... And grabbing us extra utensils so we didn't have to get up from the table. I mean... The food, the service... We scored on this trip.",

We ordered the combo BBQ to sample their BBQ and also a pulled pork sandwich. It was a large burger. Underneath all that meat was a sausage. Everything was cooked just right. The meat was juicy and came right off the bone.  The place was packed for 2pm on a Saturday, clearly pass its lunch hour but there was a steady stream of customers. If you want hole in the wall, this is the place. Everything about the place tells you these people didn't come from LA or NYC. They came from what, Arkansas? There's a boar's head on the wall to greet you and keep you company when you wait in line.  The menu items are simple. We got mac and cheese, yams, and fried okra. You get a side if you order a soft drink. How can you eat BBQ without a Coke? You just can't, so the side was an added compliment.  There is only 1 restroom though so I suggest you do your business become you come or else it might be a wait. Out of the 3 different styles of BBQ, I'd say they hit it on the head for each one. There is bbq sauce on the table if you like but I found that the ribs were nicely done and I didn't need anymore sauce.  Sauce wise, I think Lucille's might just be a tad better but not by much. I like them to cook their meat as good as this place. Is it always pefect? Nope. The first time that I came here, the baby backs were a little dry but this time everything was cooked right.  I could not finish my meal and took the rest home. If you have trouble locating this place it's across Shetakis distribution and below the Sahara bridge I believe.",

My wife liked it because it didn't have the heavy smoke flavor so it is a matter of taste. The BBQ sauce was as good as I've ever tasted, similar to #2 at the Whole Hog (for you Arkansas transplants). We saw some really good looking stuff as we shamelessly looked at everyone else's food. They had a huge hamburger piled high that looked amazing. Check out the pictures as someone must have posted one of this thing. Bottom line, it was very good.

The meats were tender and flavorful, but the BBQ does get heavy after a while.  Very friendly service, and food come in generous portions.  The $20 Pit Special was very difficult for 1 person to finish alone, have some leftover for 2 people to make next day's sandwich, but great for 3 to share!  Don't forget to check in for free dessert offer! :)",

    "text": "LIP SMACKING BARBEQUE NOURISHED FROM THE GODS THEMSELVES.  Seriously this place precedes itself. Just so you can understand the level that Rollin Smoke is on they were awarded for top 20 best bbq restaurants in america from localeats AND best burger in vegas seven. Yeah...they're pretty epic.  It's pretty easy to miss this place, they're near the cross streets highland and desert inn, inside a signless plaza. Just look for a grill outside and you'll be fine. The vibe of the place is very relaxed mixed with decorations of tshirts, a pig, awards, and a mural. A big plus in my book is the amount of seating they have, from the times I went I never had to fight for a table.   Customer service? Always on point. They strive for it. Anything wrong with what you're eating? They'll fix it. They always have a guy walking around asking people if they're doing fine.   If you're coming here for the first time you should definitely try the rib tips, and outlaw burger. It takes a while for the outlaw burger to cook, nonetheless it's worth the wait. Let me start off with the rib tips. You can order 1/2 pound or a pound, if you're eating with a group of people, just share a pound it'll be more than enough. Their rib tips are mouthwatering!!! Cooked to perfection. And when you get those fatty pieces in your mouth you can taste the definition of a good bbq. The outlaw burger is just as satisfying. Let me just list the ingredients in the burger it has; brisket, onions, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage, slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ailoi. Yeah, all that in a burger. You know that one question? What do you want to eat before you die? This might be the answer.  Tip: There's no shame in getting your hands dirty and pigging out. Dam son just eat that bbq! And you can order to-go over the phone!",

    "text": "If you're looking for good BBQ in Vegas, Rollin Smoke is where you're going to find it!  Located in a small plaza on Highland, Rollin Smoke is a fairly small restaurant and gets crazy busy at times. When you walk in, there's a large menu on the wall and after you place your order, you can go sit down and they'll bring the food to you. The menu is somewhat large and features classics like pulled pork sandwiches and meat combo plates. They've also got some not-so-usual options like the gigantic Outlaw Burger, Chicken 'n Waffles and even an all you can eat option.   I usually order a two meat combo with brisket and hot link. Most places seem to serve a packaged hot link and just toss it in sauce. While I have no idea whether there's is or not, it's one of the better ones I've had. The sausage is flavorful with a great snap and they don't douse it in sauce. Since I'm a fan of spicy food, I like that there's has a little kick to it as well. And there's a reason I can't stay away from the brisket either. It's extremely tender, flavor is great and it's not overly smoky. Again, even though I really like their sauce, they don't douse the meat in it which is a huge plus. You have to try the sauce though, it's slightly sweet but has a mild heat...really tasty.  If you're into dessert, they have a few options there too. We've used the Yelp check-in for a free mini dessert a few times and always get the peach cobbler. My wife is a peach cobbler fanatic and this is her favorite in town. I've heard good things about the banana pudding though and I'll be getting that next time.  This a solid 4.5 stars for me and only because I've had inconsistent plate sizes. One time I got a combo plate that had so much meat I couldn't finish it, but then the two other times we've went, I finished mine and starting picking off the wifeys. Not a huge deal but it's a bit irritating. Either way, Rollin Smoke serves some of the best BBQ in town and at much better prices then most of them too. Top it off with friendly service and you got a must try spot!",

The chopped variety has way too much in the way of questionable ingredients like grizzle and fat, even some bones.  Their barbecue is so good that it's hard to understand why they have opted not to serve sliced brisket sandwich. This would be a huge improvement and worth at least one more star.  UPDATE: Decided to head back to Rollin Smoke for some BBQ on a weeknight.  Got there around 8:10 pm on a Thursday night and they were CLOSED!   CLOSED? at 8 pm?  WTH?  This is VEGAS, not Arkansas.  Dang hillbillies.   One star demotion for lack of awareness of their market.",

The pork and beans were slightly undercooked and too peppery for my taste.   The corn nuggets on the other hand were probably the highlight of my food. They were fried pieces of goodness. :) so addictive. I think I ate a million pieces.   To be fair, also, the outlaw burger and the meatloaf were thoroughly enjoyed the rest of my party so maybe that's more of the way to go.",

    "text": "The restaurant is in a very odd industrial area near auto shops, strip clubs and warehouses, and is probably the only one in the area. You walk in to a haphazard restaurant with not much of a front counter, but instead a confusing podium to order at with no one standing there most of the time. The menu is on a wall kind of near this podium, so you better know what you want before you walk over to order. There are a handful of two, four and large top tables between the two awkwardly cramped rooms of this place, sparsely decorated with a few down lights and some reclaimed wood on the walls. You can tell it was thrown together cheaply, but it seems to fit with the homegrown feel of backyard BBQ. The great smell of smoke fills the space the whole time you sit there, and never really fades away while you're there or from your clothes when you leave.  The menu features pretty much all the standards you would expect from a BBQ joint, but as I said I was suckered into ordering their Outlaw Burger: brisket, onion, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and chipotle aioli. I'm skeptical of any BBQ place that can't get sweet tea right, so I was nervous about this thing given the somewhat flavorless tea I sat with while waiting for my burger to arrive. And what came out was just too big to enjoy; the patty alone is a thick mass of meat that's possibly a bit overcooked just because of its size and how long it has to cook. The bun was far too small and thin to hold up to this mess, even with a decent helping of lettuce at the bottom to create a buffer from any sauce. Probably the best flavor in this whole thing were the onion rings, which tasted far better on their own than in the burger where they got lost in the myriad of flavors. The huge glob of cheese had good flavor, but like most other things in this burger there was just a bit too much of it. As for the aioli, slaw and other items, I couldn't really tell you much because I didn't notice them enough. I think if this were your typical 1/4 or 1/3 pound burger it would probably be pretty good, still a far cry from the best burger in Vegas as they've claimed, but maybe in the upper half. But like my recent complaints about a huge burger in San Diego, this is just too much to properly enjoy.  Something extremely puzzling and disappointing for me was the complete lack of fries with my burger. Looking at their menu online now, apparently the $8.99 \"smoking deal\" for the Outlaw Burger is a deal for just the burger, you have to read the small print at the bottom where it says to add $3 for a side and drink. I wish the guy that took my order would have said something as I spent $2 for just my iced tea expecting the fries that were in the picture with my burger. What burger doesn't get ordered with fries?! I guess maybe one of this size, as I surely wouldn't have been able to finish it if I ate anything else, but fries are almost always a necessity. For $11.88 I certainly got a lot of food, but I don't know if it was worth the cost or stomach bomb. I have a feeling that you should stick to the True BBQ that this place is known for, and not their \"best burger\". I know I'll be back to test this theory.",

    "text": "How does one put into words the experience of tasting great BBQ?  Rollin Smoke that's how.  Went here tonight with my father and this place far exceeded our expectations.  I thought it was so unique this place offers \"all you can eat\" for anything and everything on the menu.  I was personally on a mission to devour some St. Louis style BBQ ribs, greens and some \"kickin beans\" and.........well I can say this: \"If these are not served in heaven, then I shall not go\"  absolutely remarkable and hands down the very best BBQ in Vegas.  Don't let the \"hole in the wall\" location fool you, it will be one of the best BBQ experiences of your life.  The owner is very pleasant and takes a great deal of pride in what they serve.  Service was great and food was even better.   THIS IS A MUST VISIT!",

Rolling smoke has been my favorite BBQ in town for over a year, love the brisket, giant beef ribs, and sides.  $24.99 all u can eat dine in special seems like good value. My issue is as it's gotten more popular the wait for ordering and food is tough, especially if I'm with my children. I don't see the owners in anymore and it's not as friendly. My last visit half my to go order was missing (after waiting over 30 min) and the employee made a joke that it was my fault because I initially didn't respond when my name was called (knew my order wasn't one bag).  I would have preferred apology for trying to send me on my way with half of a $40 order! Despite loving the food I'm hesitant to go unless during slow time",

    "text": "Usually when I'm rollin' and smokin' somethin'...it ain't food. This place is worth rollin' into cause the food is smokin' good. The dudes that runs this place are extremely personable-servin' some heapin' helpings of hospitality along with their scrumptious offerings. Most everything I have had here is excellent. The highlight, as mentioned before is the Outlaw Burger, that thing hits the bull's-eye! I am especially fond of their jalapeno slaw, a wonderful kick to that stuff. The potato salad is not one of my faves, a little too bland for me, but that said, it still has this delightful subtle flavor that I can see lots of folks digging, and honestly I would order it again. Great bark on the meats. The sauce at the tables...should you feel the need...offers a complex mix of flavors with a welcomed spicy kick. Most of the sides are prepared in house. One employee told me the fried okra is frozen, but I (and one of my friends) seriously thought it tasted fresh. They must have found a great supplier. This interior is not divey at all, though for some, the location is. Fresh brewed regular and sweet tea. Two separate dining areas with 2 different vibes. Holy smoke, Rollin' Smoke ain't no joke, I felt high driving home and didn't even toke.",

The first meal we had we ordered a to-go bag and it was missing the pulled pork. I figured it was an oversight and we would go again.   The next day we tried to call in a large order but the phone went straight to voice mail so it took a while to get our food and when questioned how much longer, they made rude comments to us.  We have received good service in the past but the owner was working during that visit and this time he was out doing a BBQ competition. No matter how good the food is, I'll take my business somewhere else where I'll be treated as a customer.   Spent $190 on my two visits combined.  Resolution:  Train your help, food runners, to not to be rude to the customers!!",

I got the spareribs after asking their preference and was glad I did.  I also got a lb of brisket and it was so tender, juicy and the meat flavor shined!   To die for.  I had a side of baked beans and while they were good, they were not the best beans I have had but were pretty darn good.  I think they had pulled pork in them  and alot of it! I had called my order in (after searching yelp) and they were very helpful in recommendations over phone.  When I got there, everyone was friendly.   They offered me a free drink while I waited.  My order was ready in about 2 mins.  They thanked me.  I didn't get a lot of nice service like this in Vegas so it was great to have nice people.  Location is odd and you wouldn't stumble on it.  Go and enjoy real BBQ.  You will not get food like this on the strip.  They do \"eat in\" also, on nice picnic tables and I loved their drink glasses (nice sturdy to go cup).  I can't give them enough praise.   I WILL BE BACK NEXT TIME IN VEGAS!!",

    "text": "Like other folks here have said, I claim to be NO expert on barbecue except to profess that I freaking LOVE it and have had the privilege to eat it all over SoCal and throughout our travels across the US.   I still have many, many places to visit and look forward to many more eatin' adventures but here's the down low on this joint and Dusty, the front man for the place.   We were in Vegas to celebrate our 10 yr wedding anniversary and my husband wanted to surprise me with a visit to a great barbecue place so he did his research and away we went. Below are my humble observations, take them with a grain of salt, add in what everyone else wrote and you are in for a treat.  1. Yes, it's in the hood/industrial type area, sprinkled with strip joints and such, but get over it, the rent is probably cheaper than hell and there are always customers around.   2. Dusty, a young dude to greeted us at the door, is one of the owners and what a hell of a front man he is. Uber friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and filled with positive energy, he treated us like old friends and even if the q had turned out to be shitty, we would've come back just for the customer service...thankfully it was not.  3. Small joint, not a huge menu but concise, to the point and the prices are so freaking good! Most of the barbecue places we've ever been to, charge an arm and a leg for a decent sized plate...here? 3 big, meaty pork ribs, 2 sides, a roll, $11.00 bucks and well worth every penny.  4. The bacon potato salad, jalapeno, corn coleslaw and banana pudding were absolutely legit and awesome!!  5. The best part? My BEEF SHORTRIBS!! So tender, so meaty, with just enough smoky bark on the outside, I sucked those bones like a flipping piranha...OMG!!  All in all, 5 stars all around and if I could give more, I would. If you visit and love the place, then please write even a quick review. They deserve as much business as they can handle and I hope they are there for a very, very long time...Good luck Dusty and thank you again for the most awesome beef ribs I've had in a long time.",

    "text": "Rollin Smoke looks like a hole in the wall located behind  the strip but it is truly a hidden gem. It is a little pricy but the food is good. The pulled piggy sandwich is my FAVORITE thing to order here you can make it a combo where you get your choice of a side and a drink. It comes with these sweet pickles that I love to bite into every now and then. I usually order mine with a side of cheesy mac and an extra side of sweet corn bread. I end up leaving here super stuffed every time, but well worth it! I love experimenting with the sauces trying to see which one is the best, so far I think Mommas Sweet D-licious sauce is the best along with their mustard sauce. There is seating inside and outside for those who want to take a breath of fresh air. The cashier guy was beyond nice and gave us the best customer service while we were there. These guys are one of the best in town, my boyfriend and I keep coming back.",

    "text": "I love great bbq and this place certainly lived up to expectations.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which comes out on a hoagie roll that made it easy to eat and to add in copious amounts of pork.  There is something special about meat that is just so tender that taking a bite is more about flavor than actual chewing, I left not only satisfied but with thoughts about when I could next return.   There are many options for sides from waffle fries, mac n' cheese, potato salad, and a baked potato.  I only tried the waffle fries which was provided in enough of a portion for adequate sharing but also were great to soak up more of that delicious tangy bbq sauce.    This is a bbq place that requires several visits since you'll be wanting to come back and try what everyone else had in full quantities.",

You place your order at the counter and then food is brought to you, so we didn't really have a waiter, but everyone was nice and I wasn't without anything that I needed. If you check in on Yelp you get a free dessert. I got Banana Pudding cause duh...and it did not disappoint.

    "text": "---Rant---  Great place when you are starving for meat!!!  Generally I stick with Tri-Tip, Chicken and/or Brisket when trying a new place.  These guys did NOT disappoint!  Meat was tasty, flavorful and juicy (not overly greasy, just juicy).  The Chicken was cooked perfectly and unusually soft (in a good way), same with the beef.   The cornbread is excellent...tastes like it has a lot of butter, which is pretty damn good IMHO~  The seating sucks though; I had to have ma boy buy my grub while I went and sat in an open booth. There was a huge crowd of folks waiting to order (you order first, pay then go sit.  They bring you your food).  I kinda got some disappointed looks from the crowd as I apparently was the only one smart/clever enough to go grab seats while your buddies are ordering for you?! haha  Side Note 1 - Don't ask the staff if they have any to-go containers...they will look at you like a total dumbass as containers are plainly visible at the counter, next to the soda and utensils hahaha (the dude just rolled his eyes and pointed, I in turn looked a damn fool~ hahahaha)  Side Note 2 - This is on a side street that has about 4-5 strip clubs. The street itself is dark and looks like the kind of area you could get mugged, raped, etc.  So go with a nice sized group of people if you're gonna go at night, and bring tazers or mace~  ---Overall---  Service: A.  We got our food pretty quick~  Food: A. Great food if you're looking for a heavy meat fix!!!  Atmosphere: C.  If I wasn't worried about getting ass-raped, I would probably visit more often.",

    "text": "So I decided to quit my job, and as a \"victory\" lap, I came directly to Rollin Smoke to get my mind off my troubles.  I asked for the trio meal, with brisket, pork and baby back ribs, but they refused me.  They said they could add the baby backs to the duo meal for an extra $6.  Not wanting to get off the \"high\" of quitting my job, I relented.  This time I asked for no greens and they obliged.  When the meal came, the food was cold. (It was about 7:30pm; they close at 8:30.)  I tried not to let it get me down.  The $6 baby backs amounted to exactly two (2) bones.  And I'm not even quite sure I got the baby backs, because they were meaty and chewy (and cold), resembling St. Louis ribs (which I could have gotten at a discount).  Anyway, that's not my biggest complaint.  This time, for some reason, I found the BBQ sauce to be very spicy.  I don't recall it being spicy the first time around (otherwise, I would have marked it down).  So for those of you keeping count -- I recommend the brisket and the pork but NOT the \"baby back ribs\" -- and also, come here during lunch, when the food is presumably fresher and hotter.  Aside from that, I think I'm done here.  Not that I can afford to eat anymore, now that I'm an unemployed bum.  Merry Christmas.  I'm going to kill myself.",

The meatloaf was weird it wasn't your typical meatloaf. It was a lot of pork and fat, I did manage to find some lean pieces and the flavor was good. The Mac and cheese was pretty good but the star of the show were the corn nuggets. They were so sweet and crunchy I would go back just for those!!",

Maybe because it was near closing time but they were out of green beans and Mac N Cheese and to make up for it they gave us extra helpings of onion rings.  Nothing was fresh.  The onion rings had been sitting around so they were oil drenched.  The cornbread was dry and pasty.  The baby back ribs were also very dry which made it taste like jerky.  I got a 1/2 pound of the burnt tip brisket and this item was also drenched in oil.  All this resulted in some sleep depriving acid reflux and searching for some antiacid medication   Look I don't really care but when you're paying 34$ just for the two meat items and the total bill coming to over 50$!  This place just wasn't worth it.  I thought with more than 2000 reviews I shouldn't have run into problems like this.  Is was highly dissatisfied and disappointed!

The burger is pretty mediocre (though it claims to be the best), but the rest on the menu is pretty good. My biggest gripe is the price.  It's as much to eat here as it is at a nice sit down restaurant. For a small shack that serves BBQ at picnic tables, it's a bit pricey. It certainly isn't the best BBQ I've ever had.  That being said, good BBQ in Vegas is virtually non-existent, and Rollin Smoke's existence is appreciated.  It's definitely worth a visit to see if it's your style of BBQ.",

The sexy smell of BBQ immediately welcomes you when you walk in the door.  Our order taker (sorry didn't get his name) determined the best combo when we told him what we wanted.  The corn bread was to unbelievably moist and delicious.  We would have ordered more for dessert with Blue Bell ice cream if we hadn't been so stuffed.  The beef ribs were huge and melted into smokey heaven in your mouth.  The brisket was plastic fork tender and moist.  You have to get corn nuggets - spicy fried creamed corned!  We were supposed to share but I ate more than my share!   They must be world famous as a large van of Aussies (in for Red Flag) filled up the place and took their orders to go!   The place has a lot of seating...can't wait to plan a lunch adventure for my co-workers!",

Brisket had beautiful smoke ring in it, the pulled pork and hot link were incredible and the ribs were great. While my friend enjoyed the babybacks more, I am a little torn as the meaty St. Louis ribs I got were incredible. Tough choice, i think the best to do is get both like I did. Haven't had the bbq chicken yet, but I will be back to try some and I will be sure to sing your praise to people looking for good bbq. I think halfway through my meal I realized i had stopped using my fork long ago and was fingers covered with delicious bbq sauce and goodness. Keep up what you are doing and I will be sure to be back!",

The bathroom is well....... sad. The bathroom is nearly like a gas station's - useful but don't touch anything.  The paper towel dispenser fell off the wall, but nobody put a roll of towels on the counter so you can dry your hands off. They have rolls of towels on every table - just not in the bathroom.

It was crowded, but we managed to find a table in the back.  I can certainly see how popular this place could get on the weekends or evenings!  We both ordered the Trio special and had pulled pork, ribs and burnt edge brisket.  The pork was very good and the ribs were delicious!  The burnt edges were a bit fatty for both of us, but the sauce on the tables was very tasty indeed!  I had the waffle fries and a side of mac and cheese - both very tasty.  Service was fantastic and everyone who worked there was friendly and accommodating to our questions about the menu.  I will definitely be returning with the family now that I've found this place!  Boss enjoyed it as well and will probably return next time he's back in town.  Definitely a word-of-mouth place as you won't pass by this place unless you do business on Industrial/Highland!",

I certainly hope business is good for them because it is downright impossible to find reasonably priced, authentic bbq in Vegas.  Good advertising having the smokers in the parking lot or else I would never have known it was there.   Only suggestion I would make would be to add more sides such as collards, etc.",

I chose the ribs and quarter white meat chicken with loaded mashed potatoes. My bf ordered a brisket po boy sandwich with seasoned fries. The ribs were tender and good but, didn't have a lot of meat on them and only got 2 ribs. However, I wasn't feeling the bbq sauce very good. The breast of the chicken was dry so, I didn't eat it. The mashed potatoes weren't really creamy and reminded me of KFC's mashed potatoes with cheese, bacon, and green onions added. My bf's sandwich had about 3 slivers of brisket on a big bun, with a ton of lettuce and done pickles. He said he liked it but, expected more meat on the sandwich. I agree,  the portions are pretty small and knew I'd be hungry later. I'd come back but, only for the ribs to-go. My bf would probably order the brisket by the pound. Service was just ok, nothing special.",

It's meant to feed 2 people or one very hungry person, like in my husband's case. I had a brisket sandwich for $7.99. I usually like bbq sauce to be sweet and tangy, and their sauce has a little kick of spice. I loved it!

Normally I prefer my beef ribs woth dry rub and no sauce but I didnt order that way since it is my first time and I fear it too be too dry (been burned by other BBQ joints this way) but i would imagine it wouldve been great and will order this way next time.    This place is a gem and highly recommended.",

It won't be much longer before they are hiring Front of the House staff to man the tables!   The food is good, The staff is nice. I like that they are getting their name out there and a local business being successful.   On this trip I had the chicken, which is always good in flavor and spare rib, in the duo smokin plate. The spare rib was tender and tasty. I got the jalapeno coleslaw...it's so good! The BF got the Brisket Dog, omg! If I wasn't eating right, I'd devour that whole thing without a second thought! It was so good, anything with nacho cheese is good! The BF got the potato salad, which was basic but the bacon of course added a yummy touch!   We love this place! We wish it much success and don't forget your free dessert with your Yelp check in.",

The place was pretty packed when we got there but they were quick to take orders and expedite the line. You order first then find your seat so be ready!   Everyone in my group was so hungry that we didn't even entertain the thought of sharing (which we really should have) and we all ordered separately.  I opted for the chicken wings with the sweet corn pups and a side of catfish. One of my friends got the meatloaf and others got the ribs and brisket sampler deals.  OMG SOOO MUCH FOOD!!! I loved the sweet corn pup things an the catfish was sooo good. Battered just right with alot of catfish meat. My wings were pretty tasty. I went for the mild sauce as its blazing hot in vegas already and I didn't want to suffer by eating hot and spicy buffalo wings. I really wanted to though ;(  Oh they also have sweet tea! Yes... I love bbq and this place does it right. Next time my friends and I will definitely go for the family meals and will split it lol!",

When I get back to work everyone is so jealous when they smell how amazing I smell from all that smoked barbecue goodness.  Prices are great and you get a whole lot of delicious food. Sides are pretty delectable too. I typically go with the corn bread though, it comes with two big squares.  I leave this place so happy, full and smelling of smoked meat but it's so worth it!

I was only able to finish one rib, it was flavorful and had a lot of meat on it. The waffle fries were crispy, the star for me was the corn nuggets. So addicting.

    "text": "I don't write reviews much unless something is worth sharing or a place needs more reviews. In this case, I just HAVE to rave about this place even if it has more than enough reviews. The stars it dawns are definitely earned. If you love meat or Southern food, you can't go wrong here. I've had my fair share of meat experience and Rollin Smoke BBQ is high on that list.   The Food: \"Pit Special\" - $20 + tax You receive 4 meats of your choice and 4 sides plus a drink. Portions are pretty big although I'm on the smaller side (4'10, 90lb) so an average build will definitely not leave hungry. I got the brisket, spare ribs, hot link, pork, potato salad, corn nuggets, Mac n cheese, and lastly corn bread. The meat was delicious, some bits were dry but nothing too bad, mostly moist and falling off the bone. Cooked well with a little pink in the brisket and ribs, subtle smoky flavor, and had a slice of bread to cushion the goodies. The corn nuggets remind of corn muffins I've had growing up in the Philippines (corns bits, crunchy bread) so I loved them but it might be a hit or miss for others. The corn bread is TO DIE FOR. Soft, moist, amazing flavor. Boyfriend had to promise me that we'd take some home when we leave Vegas back to LA - it's just that good. Can't vouch for the other two sides since I was too full to try them and I don't want to review it non-fresh. 5/5  Atmosphere: Spacious considering the location. Has outdoor seating and a private party room to the side. Couple flatscreens to entertain you. Steel tables - easy to clean and sanitize. No napkins, just a huge roll of paper towel since you're bound to get down and dirty. Interesting mural of people on the wall and mascot merch scattered around. All in all, eating there was good. 3/5  Customer Service: You order and pay at the front then seat yourself. Cashier was nice enough, not super welcoming but helped me out with recommendations and they were all hits :) Although she did accidentally charge me extra on the 4th side (put as separate from the Pit Special) coming out to $25 instead, no biggie if it's not a repeat mistake. I only saw 3 staff on the floor: main cashier and the other two switching off delivering food and checking up on customers. The one guy was very nice and welcoming! 4/5   Definitely recommend this place.",

No hi or hello, it was like we were annoying her. She treated everyone like this so I didn't feel singled out. We got our food, brisket sandwich and pulled piggy sandwich. I felt like the meat could only be saved by drowning it in sauce. Mac and Cheese and Cornbread was good, but I wanted great BBQ and it came up short. The restaurant is a weird layout too. If it's a cold day sit in the inner portion of the restaurant. The area by the order counter is by the door which never closes. Even the employees won't shut it when they go in and out, so it can get cold while you are eating. There are better BBQ joints in town...I suggest trying another place.",

For me to give 5 stars, the place has to be so good that I cannot wait to come back........my first visit, and I'm a.ready planning the next trip! I got the sliced brisket and pulled pork......both were so flavorful that they didn't really need any sauce, but I used just a slight splatter. The brisket had a beautiful smoke ring, and the pork was perfectly tender. The loaded mash was really good as well.....tons of great favors. My wife doesn't like meat, so she got the catfish po boy, and loved it. Then she tried some of my pulled pork, and loved it even more! She now wants to come back and get the pork! Thank you Rollin Smoke, you have brought my wife over to the dark side, and we can now enjoy BBQ together! One last thing, everyone there is super friendly, and even the pit master came out to see how we were enjoying our food. It is evident to me that everyone there really takes pride in serving a superior product! I'll be back, even though it is in a \"medium scary\" neighborhood!",

    "text": "Rolling in deliciousness!   As a local, I have found it difficult to track down the best bbq in Las Vegas, but after walking into Rollin Smoke I was assured I had come to the right place. The intoxicating smell of authentic bbq smokiness gave my sense of smell a run for its money and my hope was that my taste buds would follow along in happiness. I was so pleasantly surprised as the ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken arrived at our table. We ordered the four meat, three side combo to be able to try a little bit of everything. The sides we picked included the jalapeno cole slaw, bbq beans, mac and cheese and an extra side of dirty Vegas rice and cornbread. You know you've come to the right spot when everything you try is finished with an mmmm sound, a smile and a look of agreeable satisfaction to the person you are dining with. Just to describe a few, the brisket had an intense flavorful smoke on it you could see and was tender and delicious. The ribs were perfectly large and full of rich meat with a sweet intense spice rub. The jalapeno cole slaw was crunchy, a little spicy and had just enough dressing without drowning it. The mac and cheese was the perfect cheese sauce to noodle ratio with noodles cooked just right without drying out the dish. The cornbread was cooked perfectly,  sweet and salty with a warm layer of melted butter on the bottom that made it a little more guilty of being just so good. We look forward to going back and letting our friends know this is where they can find the best bbq in town. Thanks for bringing great bbq to Vegas!",

FYI to management, MULTIPLE taxi loads full of people had to be turned away while we were sitting outside so you are missing out on business with those crazy early hours. We were told nothing fried could be ordered as the deep fryers were off. Look, if you're open to 8, have all the food til 8. Jeez. So, the ribs we spent $30 on were so dry and old, we felt slighted. Friendly staff but really, that's not enough. I can say for sure that was our second and last trip there. There's way too many places that want business to deal with old and dried out food we had to dump in the trash. Passing on this place permanently and I work with many tourists on the strip daily and always recommended this place but never again.",

I had told everyone here in the office about it a while back but everyone lives out here in Henderson and never goes on the other side of town. From the time I walked in the door the smell of great BBQ filled up the offices. Everyone came out of their office to the front room and gasp of how much food and how great it smelt. I will always give John Holland and the guys at Rollin Smoke a 5 star. For a guy from AR he sure does know his stuff. I would also Like to say that Chief Yancey can make a MEAN melt. SOOOOO GOOD..

    "text": "Aren't expectations a bitch sometimes?  With over 700 reviews and a 4.5 star average, as well as numerous esteemed Yelpers referring to Rollin Smoke Barbecue as the \"best bbq in town\" I had fairly high expectations for my first visit. Sadly, I was not blown away.  Allison S., Dyanna L. and I met up at Rollin Smoke with our men for dinner on a recent Saturday evening. From the parking lot the place smelled amazing, so we quickly got in line to order. Rollin Smoke is a order-first-then-seat-yourself kind of establishment which I have no problem with. I do wish the tables were wiped down more regularly though, as the one we were at was rather dirty.   Our food was ready very quickly. My husband and I both got the 2 meat plate; brisket and chicken for him, ribs and pork for me. Each came with a side (green salad for him, loaded mashed potatoes for me) as well as a 'roll' which is really just a slice of bread.   For me, good bbq means good ribs, and ribs will always be what I judge BBQ on.  This is where Rollin Smoke fell flat. The ribs were tough, not the fall-off-the-bone that I expected (and read about in other reviews). The flavor was ok, certainly not amazing. The pork was better, my husband's brisket was good, and Allison let me try some of her hot link which was excellent.   Perhaps it was just an off evening for Rollin Smoke? I will certainly go back and try the ribs again, but for the time being I can not give Rollin Smoke more than an A-OK rating.  NOTE: The price for All-You-Can-Eat has gone up to $34.99. Website is not updated as of 1/5/15.",

The only thing I didn't like about it is it didn't come with any extra toppings like tomatoes, onions, or lettuce. If you make your way to Vegas make sure to visit this place.

If I could, I would have eaten more. My eyes were hoping for dessert, but my stomach said no way.  I got the rib plater and it was amazing. It comes with a monster of a beef rib, three baby backs, and two spareribs. For $17.99, you get a side and a drink with it. I got the kickin' beans and added the jalapeno coleslaw for $2 more. BBQ beans are often too sweet for me. Here, too. The coleslaw though is delicious. The perfect balance of creamy and spicy. The baby backs were my least favorite of the bunch. Mine were somewhat dry. I needed to smother them in their housemade BBQ sauce. Usually beef ribs can be tough, but I pulled the whole thing off the bone and inhaled. It was huge and contained so much meat.   They have a $34.99 AYCE option for anything on the menu, but I felt like I was about to die after half of my plate.",

The hot links are really good, have a nice spice to them  The pork was good but a bit on the dry side  The ribs were good but not ZOMG amazing or anything.  The BBQ sauce was excellent.  Great flavour with a bit of heat  I'd recommend just getting the brisket and hot links based on my experience.",

I'm giving this place 5 stars and I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas for sure. Ribs beef and pork were really good! Brisket was good too. Didn't really get a taste of the sauce because my dumb ass didn't shake the bottle at the table duh, so I basically squeezed the watered down crap on my meat that forms on the sauce in the bottle. The meat was so good I didn't care. The sides were ok. Greens really good. Potato salad not so much. I'm picky with potato salad, so you decide if you go here to eat. Overall this is good barbecue, and for the guys it's right next to a strip club.",

The meat is super soft and smoky flavor is amazing. The bed of mashed potatoes it sits on are super creamy and seasoned so good. Its topped with the best crispy fried onions. The stuffed potato is huge and stuffed with meat but is a great starter for two. All of the sides are pretty good too! The green beans are my fave as they are mixed with parm cheese- Yum! The sweet tea is nice and sweet and perfect compliment to the meal.  The banana is fantastic as well. You can tell its made daily because the bananas are not brown and the pudding is just the right sweetness. One of the best BBQ joints in town!",

The meat was moist and pretty much fall of the bone....so good. My husband said they were probably the best beef ribs he's ever had and I agree. Where do they sell ribs this big in stores??  Burnt end sandwich was BOMB! Also very fatty but still delicious. The shrimp po' boy was also very good.   Don't forget to order a side of corn nuggets especially if you've never had them before.",

And by smoke, I don't mean the big dispensary that recently opened up nearby either!  I had some relatives flew in for the SEMA car show and they texted us to meet up for lunch.  They picked Rollin Smoke due to the sheer number of Yelp Reviews (2000+) and 4.5-star average!  I am no BBQ connoisseur; however I really liked the food we ordered.  The pit special came with 5 meats including spare ribs (which my wife loved),  pulled pork, chopped brisket, smoky sausage and skin-on, bone-in chicken with very juicy meat.  I liked how everything was seasoned and lightly sauced if at all.  After all, they have lots of options for sauces for you, ranging from sweet, vinegary, tangy, to downright hot and spicy!  The other excellent aspect are the sides.  The Collard Greens were perfect - just bitter enough, while the yams were sweet.  The surprise dish and everyone's favorite were these sweet corn fritters that was a hybrid between a tater tot and cream corn.  The sliders trio was also okay- it comes with your choice of meat.  Franky, its probably better to stick to getting more ribs or other items ala carte.   Definitely worth getting an Uber ride down here for a group pig-out lunch!",

    "text": "Oh Wow! I'm very impressed with this place from their pit sampler to their outlaw burger, this place has it all! It has everything you would think a smoke house BBQ place should have and more! My pit sampler had 5 meats to try and included Smoked Brisket, Smoked Ribs, Smoked Chicken (thigh & drum), Smoked Pulled Pork, and who can forget the Smoked Sausage Links. Their Outlaw Burger was featured in one of the travel channel's TV Show as well as the Food Network's TV show and lastly was on many different YouTube Channel Show's. All these shows had one thing in common and that was it put me on the Hunt for Rolling Smoke Barbeque and to try as many different items as I could! The Outlaw burger was not a let down not by any means. You could tell the burger meat itself was blended with brisket and ground sirloin, and the put into the smoker to cook to perfection before serving it! As for their 3 sides that comes with my Pit Sampler I choose their famous Cheesy Mac N Cheese, Loaded Mashed Potato's, and their Corn Nuggets. I also order in addition some of their moisten Corn Bread, some of their Waffle Fries with a special rub on them (Amazing), and lastly 2 8oz tubs of their House BBQ Sauce and Spicy House BBQ Sauce. Which all made this meal one of the best meals I have ever had, and I'm not just talking for BBQ meals only. I am talking about one of the meals ever that I got to partake in, hands down!! If you're in Las Vegas and near the strip then I highly recommend this place if you wanna have some of the best food in Las Vegas, and as well as in the Entire USA. Then I highly recommend this place to anyone who reads this review. Don't let the area deceive you either because by the looks of where this place is located. It makes you really hold True to \"You can't always judge a book by its cover\"!",

Rollin Smoke serves up a plethora of great ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, hot links, burgers and much more. The Outlaw Burger is an award winner and the links are amazing. I'm a rib fanatic and love the St. Louis spareribs. They go light on the sauce and let the ribs speak for themselves. Beef ribs are huge, tender and delicious. They are also very proud of their smoked meatloaf. My girlfriend's 94 year old little Texas mama loved her catfish which was cooked perfectly. Many delicious sides. I recommend the corn nuggets. Loved them! Our host who also owns the place, Dusty, could not have been more accommodating or hospitable. I don't live in Las Vegas but whenever I am anywhere near the area I make sure to stop at Rollin Smoke. I've never been disappointed. Great BBQ right off the Las Vegas Strip! Who woulda' thunk it?",

    "text": "Disappointed!! All hype no substance. I am sorry to say i was veryyy disappointed with my fist experience at  this place. I am big foodie so I opted for the \"all you can eat\" option to try different things. I ordered Beef ribs first which were pretty average. Then I ordered baby ribs & to my utter shock I got 2 pieces of ribs as hard as a rock. It seems as if there lying on the side for hours & someone just reheated them. Totally tasteless & not chewable. I don't know if they offer/prepare different food for \"all you can\" customers. Trust me, I am not new to reviews & am a well traveled person (been to 34 countries so far) & I ALWAYS give benefit of doubt to any restaurant as anyday can be a bad day for them (as its for us). That's why I try more than 1 thing on multiple days before crossing out any restaurant. But my first experience here was so bad that i don't feel like going there again. To all the fans of this place.. sorry folks.. Don't agree!!",

I didn't give up hope, however, amd finally got here.  Rollin Smoke lives up to its already outstanding reputation.  If this is your first time and you're not sure what to order, no problem, you can do what we did and order a combination platter.  We had the barbecue rib platter and it was hard to day which we preferred- the burnt ends, the St. Louis ribs  or the baby back ribs. Everything was juicy and prone to falling off the bone.  The barbequed baked beans had a little more heat to them than I would have liked, but were still very good as was the bacon potato salad.  The service was very warm and friendly; the food was fixed and was ready in no time.  We are looking forward to going back soon!",

Service is so friendly, even bringing out a sample of the corn nuggets for us to try (get them!!!) and made us feel very welcome upon entering this hole in the wall.  The boy and I split the trio. We chose the brisket (chopped per the hostess's recommendation), ribs (fall off the bone ofc), and pulled pork (so much juicy tenderness!). Got their bbq beans (so good ugh) and potato salad (HIGHLY recommend) as sides. Having trouble eating it all, portion is so big!  They also have all their bbq sauces available for you to squirt on your meat (huehuehue) and you should try all of them. Mama's sweet was our favorite.   This will be one of those restaurants that I will need to visit everytime I'm in the area.",

Kind of a random location because it's surrounded by warehouses... But that doesn't really matter. The inside decor kind of gives me the creeps- they have a mural of people at a BBQ.... idk you have to see it to understand. But the food and the people there are just awesome. My boyfriend and I can usually share a entree and be pretty full. But we aren't the heaviest eaters. We order the pulled pork sandwich and drench it in their house vinegar and house BBQ sauces (they have a variety to choose from). The entrees come with sides. I can't have BBQ without mac and cheese. Theirs is alright... nothing too special. I think what makes this place -is just really good authentic, and well made BBQ.  Recommend.",

The baby back ribs & brisket were EXTREMELY dry, almost like Jerky. The chicken was dry too, but I've never had their chicken before, so I wouldn't know what to expect.  I almost didn't believe the meat was from \"Rollin Smoke BBQ\" but it was. Their flavor was really good like usual but it was the driest BBQ I've ever had. It was not tender at all! My favorite part of the meal was the Mac N Cheese and Cornbread.  Oh, and they also forgot to include my \"Kick'n BBQ Beans\".       \"Of course they refunded me the price of the beans\". I'm really disappointed with the restaurant.",

    "text": "We were referred here by Acrylic Tank Manufacturing (Tanked) as not only a local place to see one of their tanks, but as one of the best places for BBQ in Vegas, and especially I should try the Meatloaf.   The restaurant is way off the beaten path, on strip club alley, in a dank industrial part of town, under a freeway overpass. I was impressed with the overfull parking lot and the line out the door, thinking this must be some good stuff.   The place seemed kind of run down, and the Aquarium was really disappointing. I guess it lets you know how much they care about their place. After all, who pays thousands, or tens of thousands for a custom aquarium, then replaces the amazing fish with feeder goldfish, the tank was dirty and the special features didn't function.   Back to the restaurant though, so I order, and while ordering my wife wanted some sauce to go, and the menu has prices for cup, pint, quart, gallon or whatever. I ordered a pint of house and a pint of Carolina. We ordered to eat there and paid the $50 for the 2 of us. We went and sat down, about 20 minutes later I went looking for our food, that never came, and found a girl, food runner, whatever, with our food boxed up to-go in a bag wandering around looking for us... Confusing since I ordered for dine in...  Took the bag to my wife and we opened it to start eating, and there were in addition to the 2 Styrofoam clamshells with our food, like 16 little tiny 2oz sauce ramekins. Not the glass Mason jars in the case.   I thought the meatloaf was borderline just ok, It pretty much just crumbled apart, had to use the mashed potatoes as a binder to keep the bits of meat on the fork. I make better meatloaf myself, in fact I smoke better food in general than they do. My wife had the Pulled Pork, she \"enjoyed\" it, but didn't finish it  As a BBQ connoisseur, having enjoyed BBQ in Texas and several other states, I would have to say this does not even come close to ranking as good BBQ.   Life is short, so I would not likely return.",

Bacon baked potatoe, baked beans which was not too sweet and meaty, and my favorite the cornbread. I will recommend for delicious bbq.",

    "text": "I've had this place cater my work's Las Vegas location before, but since my office is in Los Angeles, I never actually got to try it.  Our Las Vegas crew raved about it though.  Finally, when I made it out to Vegas for the millionth time we decided to swing by for some finger lickin' BBQ.  It's located quite a ways off the strip, just down the street from Spearmint Rhino, in an industrial looking area.  It's a pretty small place, but it's got some BIG flavors.   I got the 3 meat plate, since I felt like I had to stuff my face the first time to make sure I tried all the good stuff.  I picked the brisket (which is chopped unless you ask otherwise), chicken, and ribs.  For my side, I had the macaroni and cheese.  The boyfriend had the Big Hawg (pulled pork sandwich).  We didn't realize that they'd put an entire pig's worth of pulled pork in that sandwich, but we're not complaining.  The pulled pork was very tender and juicy, and the sandwich was stuffed with a whole pig, coleslaw and some delicious bbq sauce.  My 3 meats were pretty good as well, the chopped brisket had nice crispy pieces and nice juicy/tender pieces.  It was a good balance.  The chicken wasn't anything stellar, but it was good.  I really enjoyed the ribs though.  I'm not a huge rib eater because I don't really like to get my hands dirty, but these ribs fell right off the bone.  I'm totally down with that.  I'd skip the mac and cheese and go for the dirty rice (if you're brave enough) next time.  I had a few bites of my friends' rice, and I fell in love and then became insanely jealous.    The staff here is super friendly and attentive.  They'd come out and check on you every now and then to make sure that you have everything you need.  The place is clean, but seating is limited.  We got there at just about 11AM, and it was empty, but moments later it filled up quick.  They also have several different BBQ sauces out for you to try as well.  I liked the spicy one, it went well with the brisket.  I may have to add Rollin' Smoke to my list of places that I must visit when I come to Vegas.  That list is getting long, and it's getting difficult to get through the list each time.  Damn you Vegas for having such good food!",

We had the 5 meat sampler and famed Outlaw burger and both were incredible.   I have experienced some joints that do a couple of meats well but fall short on others, this place is knocking it out of the park. Brisket was juicy, pork was tender, sausage had great flavor, and chicken was smoked just right. The ribs tasted fantastic but we're not as juicy as I like, again this was the sampler so I think a slab will be juicier.  Sides of Mac n cheese, hush puppies & bacon mashed potatoes were also delicious. With drinks total came to $45 for a family of 5. They do have 10% coupon on the website. Do not leave Vegas before trying Rollin Smoke!",

You'll need to venture outside of the Strip to get here, and if you're walking from your hotel, you might just come across a tumbleweed. But if you do make the wise decision of coming out here, your mouth will thank you for it.  Everything I tried was pure barbecue heaven. And I did order a lot -- smoked sausage, pork ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. The brisket is at the same level as the stuff they serve at Fette Sau in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and that's saying a lot.",

We got the AYCE on our first visit to try everything - the beef ribs are definitely the best, the most tender and packed with the most smoky flavors. Baby backs are also quite good so I might get them again.   Note to self: avoid the dry brisket next time and not a fan of the Memphis ribs.  But I also got to sneaked a peek at the burgers the staff was serving to the other table and they're GIGANTIC. I doubt anyone would be able to keep the burger intact while devouring it... but they look hell of delicious!",

    "text": "Excellent BBQ, tucked away in an industrial-ish neighborhood.  I wanted BBQ. Yelp led me to Rollin Smoke. We drove there. Upon arrival, I was somewhat skeptical, because this place is in a somewhat sketchy area. Surrounded by strip clubs, warehouses, and a few rundown places, it doesn't really look like the place you'd take your family. But when I got past that initial impression and walked inside, I knew I was in a good place.  The location is pretty small. There is seating out in front and two rooms of seating inside. Most of it is communal in style--just picnic-style tables with attached benches. The place is permeated with the smell of smoking meat. What a great smell! There are a number of good options on the menu.  As I do pretty much without fail at a BBQ joint that is new to me, I got a sample plate with some brisket and chicken. The combo comes with a few pieces of brisket, 1/4 of a chicken (a leg and a thigh), a piece of Texas toast, a couple of pickles, and a side. I got the green beans side (despite normally going for the BBQ beans) and ate that first. I was pretty impressed with just the green beans. They were fresh and crisp and were seasoned to perfection. Then I worked my way into the chicken. It was seasoned perfectly as well and cooked just right. It was nice and tender and delicious. I often skip the skin on chicken, but this was great stuff, and I ate it all. Finally, the star, the brisket. Brisket is the standard by which I measure any BBQ joint. This is excellent brisket. It's sliced to the right thickness. It's nice and tender and falls apart with just a little work with the fork. And it's delicious. With or without any added sauce, this stuff rocks!  Speaking of sauces, there are a few options. I went with the Arkansas version, which turned out to be pretty darn good. When I first squeezed some out of the bottle, I feared that it was too liquidy, but the consistency was great when put straight onto the brisket itself.  My friend got a brisket salad, and I ended up finishing it for her. It too was delicious. I'm not really a fan of romaine-based salads, but the greens and tomatoes were all fresh, the peppers were spicy, and the brisket was delicious on the salad as well.  There are a few options that are intriguing to me for when I visit in the future with a healthy appetite. The $35 all-you-can eat option is a rarity among BBQ joints. And the picture of the burger on the wall made the burger look like quite the challenge.  This is great BBQ, not just for Vegas, but in general.",

    "text": "This is what I think of when I look for BBQ.  I have been trying all the places in Vegas I can find.   The owners are from Arkansas.  So, if you like Arkansas BBQ, Louisiana, or Texas BBQ you will be in heaven.  They have beef ribs that are juicy and delicious.  Smoked 19 hours.  They have a rub on them and then you add BBQ sauce. The Pork ribs, chicken are very good too.  Haven't been able to find any food to complain about.  I get a little quiet when I am there enjoying the food so much.  People have complained about cost to portion, but the portions are big enough for my husband to be stuffed and full most of the day.  Cost wise, it seemed reasonable for good quality BBQ to me and I will be back frequently.  I tried the catfish and it has a crunchy cornmeal coating with and no weird after flavor you sometimes get with catfish.   I have had it twice now since it is so good.  Once in a basket and once as a poor boy sandwich.   Love it.  I can't decide which is my favorite the beef ribs or the catfish.  The sides I have tried are:  mac and cheese -flavor is good, but I prefer a baked thick cheese sauce over this one. Hush puppies: pretty tasty Corn fritters:  tasty, the corn is inside a breading.   Being from Virginia I have some expectations that probably aren't normal or liked by many others.  I felt these were good, but a little blander than I like.   I enjoy the corn tucked into a spicy hush puppy myself  Haven't had space for any desserts yet, but I will have to get some to go next time.  I am usually going somewhere else after.  They also will cook up a whole pig for parties.  Price varies depending on market price so call them.  Very cool.  Can't wait to eat there again.   Also if you go early enough in the day they have a cool electrical store called Kiesub next door.   If you are tech oriented you will enjoy it.",

Get the Pitmaster Special combo, and you'll get 4 meats and 3 sides, with your choice from the 3 breads they make -- all for $20. There is enough food there for 3 adults, or eat some and take some home. Such a deal!  And there is no charge for extra plates.   The owners run the place, and are always present. They are very friendly, and love to meet new patrons. We loved the meal and the staff so much, we came here a second time during our week in Las Vegas just to try more foods. We loved everything we tried. If they take a liking to you, they just might tell you about some items in the kitchen that are not on the menu. Ask about the bread pudding and sweet potato pie!  What would give it 5 stars?  Esoteric things only. This business has not been in its current location for long. Hopefully they will continue to improve the seating and decor as they go along.

The staff brings your food, but that is all.   Food: Big portions! Had that good BBQ flavor and they had 2 different sauces you could use.

Being somewhat of a BBQ connoisseur I can't say enough good things about this place. Brisket was moist smokey and tender, pulled pork was juicy nice and smokey, and the beef ribs fell off the bone! As for my side I had the potato salad which is very much like a loaded bake potato salad with cheese, chives, and bacon. Service from cashier and mgr was also very friendly and efficient.

The reason I give it a four star is only because they never refilled the ice machine. Even after being told 4 different times that there isn't any ice.

    "text": "What I look for in a good barbecue is moist and tender meat with a strong smoke aroma and a spicy rub. Looking at the good reviews for this place, my group and I decided to come to this place.  The place itself is small so try not to come during the rush for lunch because you won't find a place to sit.  What really did like right off the bat here is that they have a large smoker you can see by the side of the building as you walk in, and you can smell the smoke already! My group ordered a combination platter called The Pit and it came with spare ribs, brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  We also shared the outlaw burger, which eventually stole the show. The sausage had a mild smokey flavor but it was a little dry. Everything else was very moist and tender and had a good smokey flavor.  The pulled pork and brisket were very tender and flavorful and didn't need any sauce.  The ribs were a little tough to eat off the bone I   I thought, and I didn't get any extra spiciness from the rub. And when I tried to kick it up a noth by adding their bbq sauce, It didnt work.  Their bbq sauce is very bland.  It has no spiciness or tang or zing.  Just mildy dressed up tomatoe sauce. The best thing I tasted there was the OUTLAW BURGER.  The baddass big flavor patty, the onion strings, and the tangy mayo were awesome together.  My advice is to come for the Outlaw burge, pulled pork, and the brisket!",

They accidentally brought us an extra plate of brisket instead of the fries. As soon as we said something the fries were next on the line. The kitchen manager came right out apologized , gave us the brisket and brought out the fries within seconds, he was very friendly.   I thought that was great service. Being born and raised in Las Vegas I have a much higher expectation of service than most others. Anyway the kitchen manager came back out one more time. Offered us free desert , he said \" even if you say no I'm bringing it out.\"  So we asked for the berry cobbler. He returned with his home made banana pudding along with an order of cobbler. The banana pudding was absolutely amazing ! The cobbler was a wine based and was excellent ! Overall the service and the food was wonderful. My father is still raving about his meatloaf and my mother says her chicken was great. I would recommend this place to anyone !",

First off the guy behind the counter (Dave I believe) was soooo friendly and soooo helpful as this was our first time there. We told him we were there for my daughters birthday (which is important later in this review).. Anway we ordered the trio and my daughter didn't want the chicken, so he replaced that with another rib ..(you can switch anything around , and depending what you get there may be a upcharge which is not bad. Now I had the brisket trio...OMG... burnt ends, sliced and chopped.. Plus I asked for a beef rib as well. The beef rib is gigantic..looked like a bone from the flintstones...so damn good..it was tender and just so damn good. My fiance had the outlaw burger... OMG..Huge and delicious. Those onion straws are also the best I ever had.. Now after our meal, next thing we knew the cooks and Kathy (love her) came to our table and sang happy birthday to my daughter and brought a little dessert out for her.. How great was that..The staff are all so friendly and the service was speedy and all I can say is we can't wait to go back !!!!",

My wife didn't have sauce on hers and in her opinion it wasn't required. I found the sauce delicious but be forewarned, it has some heat to it. The onion rings and corn nuggets were awesome sides, I wish we could have tried some more of them. We most definitely will return on our next visit and will be recommending Rollin Smoke to our friends travelling to the area.",

All of the meats were so well-cooked. You can also ask for the meats \"naked,\" which meant they only had a BBQ rub but no sauce, and then you can add your own sauce from the selection of BBQ sauces at the table. We did this because I was not sure which sauces would be spicy. The sides were pretty good as well, but the portions on those were somewhat small. We were also really impressed with their selection of beer on tap! They had a list beers, all from Colorado microbreweries, and we got to try some beers we hadn't heard of. Also, we were all super impressed with the friendly and helpful service we received. It was so fun!! This is definitely the place I recommend if you are looking for great BBQ in the Springs.",

My husband and I are foodies and love a good meal, weather it's fine dining or a hole in the wall. I hate paying for a meal that I could've made myself so it was hard to find a restaurant that was worth trying. The food here blew my mind. I ordered the duo plate where I could pick two meats and a side. I picked ribs and pork with a side of fried corn balls. My husband ordered the brisket meatloaf which came with onion rings on top and mashed potatoes. Every single food item, down to the pickles, was absolutely amazing. We didn't leave a single crumb on our plate. We also had the banana pudding that one of the chefs so nicely gave us on the house, just to be nice. He told us that there are several chefs, each one specializing in their own meat. How cool is that? No wonder it was all good. My husband hasn't stopped talking about our meal so we're going back tonight for more, I want to try the peach cobbler! Shout out to Matt at the register for helping us decide what to order. All the employees were so nice and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun. When we pulled up, our Uber driver wished us luck. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere and looks sketchy but it's really not. If you pull up and think of leaving, give it a shot. It's the best BBQ you'll ever have.",

On my first visit I had the brisket sandwich and the rib combo which comes with their spareribs, baby back ribs, and beef ribs.  I'm a Texas BBQ snob and although I cant get my Texan BBQ fix, Rollin Smoke is about the best you'll get in Vegas and they do their beef ribs perfect.....falls off the bone, tender, juicy, and so delicious you'll be in a meat coma.    Speaking of meat coma, I was talked into getting their AYCE the last 2 times for $25. This is the best value because you can literally get EVERYTHING on the menu but their portions for regular items are huge.   For AYCE, i typically get alot of beef ribs, get some brisket, and catfish.  Their catfish is perfectly fried with a nice crust and I squeeze a little lemon on it and pour a little hot sauce and i devour every bite of it.  Their desserts, cobblers are great too.  AND this place is open till 1:30 on fri/sats.  Also good for groups - came with a group of 10-12 people and they sat us all easy.  This place is a locals gem and i often see tourists finding their way here.  Def one of Vegas's best!",

It's definitely something you need to cut. The flavor was amazing, the burger was cooked just right, and I loved the onion straws. My husband got the brisket dog, he loved it too and like mine it was also very large. They stock the tables with bbq sauce that is also AMAZING. I will say that the place is pretty small and seating can be hard to come by because of the popularity of this place. It is worth the wait though! The sides are al a cart. The hush puppies were interesting with peppers inside. It added a nice spice to the puppies but they would have been much better if they served them with butter. The Mac and cheese was great as well, I believe this is one of their most popular sides based on reviews. My husband got the coleslaw, I wasn't a huge fan of this, not sure what they put on it. All together I love this place and we plan to keep going back.",

The carnivore bug.. bit my neck; visions of falling off the bone goodness, sauces, and messy fingers! I just had to try out Rollin Smoke Barbecue!     Located behind fashion show mall, near all the \"adult\" stores.. a little shack... other people drive up ; 3 guys and a girl in another vehicle pull up and order before us in line.. Too bad these male law students can't pay for the girl.. she ordered last.. I was like \" Why are they not pitching in for a lady to eat at a BBQ!?\"  i guess they are all on \"friend status\" only.....     Special of the Day: Beef tips, with two sides and a drink for $13.00.. I got the LAST order. the gentleman i ordered from, w/ braids/dreads(dirty blond) was so nice and had the best hospitality.. it was so refreshing.       I want to try some chicken and pig.. so the Half Chicken and Half Spare Ribs was in order... Mention a Check-in on Yelp and they will gladly honor a free dessert.. I asked\" What's the best to get?\"  the Braided gentleman in his accent.. \"the Banana one\".. i said \"let's go for it!\"     At last the food arrived and it easily feeds for 6. but my bf and I could finish these trays of food in two sitting!  wow, THe food here is just so different.. Smoky and not too sweet but the beef tip and ribs had a special zing... not too spicy. i just say .. ZING\" is the word and i liked it!  We chowed down.. even the loaded potato salad and chipotle Cole slaw was a nice accompaniment to the hearty meat.   Dessert! ohh my goodness real ripe banana and the pudding with the vanilla wafers and spray of whipped cream! i want one right now ! soo indulgent that i almost had a big \"O\" ..no i didn't but it made me think .. How much time did they really make this banana goodness in a cup?. was it just jello instant banana pudding and i'm just having a taste bud trip?   So... is it worth going to the Rollin? Yes! Go.and make sure to utilize the roll of paper towels on the table and don't get upset that your clothes smell like a Smoky BBQ plate!",

    "text": "The sauce, I literally contemplated drinking it straight from the bottle, but every time I looked around people were watching. Its not that thick, disgustingly sweet sauce, its thin, perfect spice level, slightly sweet with vinegar notes. Perfection.  Now the meat, had the 5 meats and 3 sides. Brisket is on point, ribs smokey deelish, chicken, cant go wrong with chicken, and the pulled pork? Yum! Hotlinks had a nice peppery smokiness to them too.   Sides: we had several and shared. Mac n cheese is pretty decent. Baked beans, tasty, but Ive had better. Cole slaw was unique and had a nice smokey flavor without the chipotle heat as suggested in the name. Potato salad was meh, typical potato salad with bacon crumbled on top. Now, the star of the sides show- those little corn nuggets. There is something magical in them. Not sure if they sprinkle opiates in them(kidding), cause they are seriously addicting. If you get one side, make it these magical little corn bombs that explode in your mouth. There are no words.  Now for service- amazing!! Everyone was super friendly and on point! I was impressed. You dont get service like this anymore! We will definitely be back :)",

The only complaint I had was the first time we went, the baked potato for our \"Spudtastic\" was way over cooked to the point of being inedible.  But I can say everything else is just amazing.  This last time we went, my mother and I split the \"Outlaw\" burger.  Probably the biggest burger we've ever eaten!!  It was humongous!!  Pork ribs are good, hot links are great, pulled pork is amazing, but the beef ribs are to die for!  Nice and charred on the outside and just deliciously tender with a hint of fattiness to it.

Some of the best bbq I've had in a while that wasn't from a chain (Famous Dave's - which I 'm not knocking as I've had great food there as well). I would go out of my way for TC Rib Crib so I'm glad I found a place closer to home.   This place is a little hard to get to but so glad we found it. I got the three meat platter with spare two spare ribs, pulled pork, and the FATTY part of the brisket with sides of cheesy mac and yams. The ribs were meaty and tender. Nice char on the meat, great smoky flavor! The pulled pork was tender as well. Great pork flavor. The fatty part of the brisket was killer! Nice burnt fat pieces with succulent strips of beefy goodness. They also threw in regular pieces of brisket which I didn't care for but took it home anyway. I don't care who makes it, I've never cared for brisket as I've always thought  it's a dry piece of meat. It was great cold the next day. The mac n cheese was creamy  enough, but even the extra cheese on top didn't make it \"cheesy\" enough. The yams were excellent. Lots of brown sugar cinammony goodness! The portions are large and come with a piece of Texas toast under the meats so it soaked up all the pork juices and was an extra added treat! My friend enjoyed his chicken and spare rib plate with jalapeno cole slaw and fried okra. There BBQ sauce is very good! Not too sweet, peppery and flavorul!      I take away a star because of the brisket and mac n cheese. I would have to try other things before upgrading to a 5. Great, friendly service and good food! I will be back!",

Today, I brought my family to show them the food I've been bringing up so many times. I order the outlaw burger with my sister and my mom gets some pulled pork. The owner comes out and sits at our table and apologizes to me saying they just ran out of an ingredient of the outlaw but asks if it's okay if he \"hooks me up.\" Knowing there's nothing on the menu that could let me down I'm completely okay with it. He comes back with extra sides and twice the food I was originally receiving. Everything was amazing. From the food to the customer service. I'd go in depth of how good everything he brought out was was but it would make this review too long to get through. Long story short; This remains my favorite local BBQ joint and it'll be yours too.",

    "text": "Okay, so my son and I went to RS last Friday night. He got the Biggin' and I got the 4 Rib plate. And that where things got crazy..........  It's been 5 days and I am still struggling to figure out where to go with this review. Some of what happened was 5 stars and more. Some of what happened was 1 star and less. So I will keep it simple; my son's Biggin' was incredible! My 4 rib combo was okay. I would have liked more flavor, both smoke flavor and seasoning flavor. The service was a mix of being both incredibly entertaining and incredibly bad.  Bottom line; although our visit didn't go as well as i would have hoped, when all was said and done they did their best to make things right. It's a great little \"mom and pop\" Q joint that is feeling the blessing/curse of yelp and LV weekly notoriety. I have no doubt they will pull through and I have no doubt I will be back.",

And I will get more corn nuggets and fried okra next time. The owner has a lot of energy and can really raise the stoke level for BBQ. It's great. I'll definitely stop by next time I'm in town.",

Instead of brisket they gave me chicken.  My ticket said brisket, so someone in the back screwed up. Also, instead of a roll, the gave me a slice of bread. That would have been fine, except that they put it UNDER the meats...  Anyway, the food I had was very good--spare ribs, pulled pork, chicken, and kickin beans.  One more thing--when you enter, the place smells like it's on fire...but in a good way.",

We ordered the brisket, ribs, hot links, peach cobbler and the banana pudding.  I do not believe they gave the banana pudding the name of grandma's banana pudding, this didn't taste like any grandmas pudding I ever tasted (it was awful).  Everything we ordered was awful. If we stayed at the restaurant we would have sent everything back and got our money back.  We  ate a few bites and threw the rest of it in the trash.  This was a waste of my money since I spend about fifty dollars on the horrible food.",

Smoked meats are fantastic, but without a uniqueness in choice of woods ( Bleh - traditional mesquite and hickory  :-P ) or without some real body of unique seasonings,,, what have ya got?  If flavor WAS there,, I didn't taste it, and I ate slowly. I had the pulled pork and brisket. Both of these should be oozing with flavor.. I had to lightly sauce every bite to enjoy it. However, the brisket was cooked perfectly, pork a little over but no biggie..the table-side sauce is excellent which got me thinking... Maybe that was their intention? To leave it bland and let the customers sauce it to their liking? In Vegas... No balls no blue chips.",

And the bbq beans were outstanding.  They definitely have a kick to them.   The ribs were SO tender!  Falling off the bone.  Brisket so very tender.  Hot links hot ;).  Chicken yummy.  They serve sauce on the side, but you don't need it because all of the meats are jam-packed full of flavor.   Husband told me to make sure and mention Dusty, the pit master.  He was very friendly and made excellent recommendations.  I can't wait to go back!",

Round 1: ribs, 2 orders of hot links, pulled pork, 2 orders of brisket with the jalapeno cole slaw, kicken beans, mashed potato casserole and potato salad.  REVIEW: meat was all tasty except for pulled pork was incredibly dry. Took a lot of extra bbq sauce to enjoy. The hot links are sure tasty with just the right amount of spice. We LOVED the kicken beans that were slightly sweet and savory -- Mmmm! The jalapeno cole slaw is unique and one to at least give a try.   Round 2: chicken, 2 rib ends, ribs (again) and sides of fried okra, corn nuggets and onion straws. The chicken was juicy but came smothered in sauce which I don't care for. Rib ends were crunchy and had True smoke flavor. The corn nuggets are AMAZING with a sweet inside and perfectly crisp outside. The fries okra came with a side of sauce that complemented it well (sort of a Raising Cane's creamier sauce). The onion straws were average but tasted good.  Luckily for them the 2nd round is smaller (less wastage). We left smelling like smoke and were super stuffed. We are not sure if we will give it another shot or not but we can say that we have been there.",

    "text": "Adding my unqualified 5 stars to a great bbq joint with a 4 1/2 star average based on nearly 1600 reviews is probably an unnecessary form of piling on.  To the extent it may add a little sizzle to the bbq fire, I've judged a lot of KCBS sanctioned bbq contests over the years, and I can state without hesitation that this is terrific bbq.  5 star all the way.  I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Will while I was there, and told him I thought he was definitely an expert bbq chef, and that his work rivaled the best of the best bbq places in the country.  Interestingly, one of my favorite dishes from Chef Will was the beef ribs, something that is never part of a genuine bbq competition.  The beef ribs were amazingly tender, with just the right amount of beefy, smokey flavor, and exactly the appropriate texture for easy biting and enjoying.  My son and I chose to take advantage of RS's amazing bargain - $35 for any amount of any items on the menu.  What a great way to sample everything.  We arrived at RS before its 10 am opening, and we were not the first in line.  This place has definitely been discovered, yet it deserves all of the new reviews it receives.  The ribs are perfectly cooked, the brisket is tender, juicy, and has just the right amount of smoke and meat flavor, the sides and desserts are absolutely terrific.  And yes, the corn nuggets are in a class by themselves.  Wow, are they special and addictive.  If that recipe ever gets out, it could be the beginning of world peace.  Even Brenda, behind the counter, was as helpful and nice as could be.  She made us feel right at home, helped us with our choices, explained the system for ordering and receiving the delicious dishes, and generally conveyed an honest, feel-good vibe.  I highly recommend Rollin Smoke for BBQ that should be on anyone's list of the top BBQ restaurants in the country.",

    "text": "When pulling into the parking lot you can smell so much smokey goodness in the air it immediately tempts your taste buds. I had my dog with & he couldn't stop sniffing the air. The place itself looks pretty dumpy but don't let that distract you because the food is wonderful. I've ordered the pound of pulled pork to go a few times to make sandwiches at home (didn't want the whole meal deal). Always good but they give you a small amount of bbq so if you like a lot you need to order more. Also, there is always a piece of bread on the bottom which I decline because if you plan on not eating right away it ends up stuck to the meat. It is still my favorite bbq spot in Vegas. Other places just don't seem to have that wonderful smokiness to the meat that Rollin Smoke does so well.",

    "text": "I met up with a few Yelpers on the day that Travel Channel's Food Paradise was filming here. We were too late for our 15 seconds of fame, but the film crew was still there and it was neat watching them work. It was also not as crowded as I had expected, so it was quick to order and many tables available. The food took a bit longer to come out, but I believe that's standard.  I ordered the \"Duo Choice of Two Meats\" Smokin Plate with Hot Link and 2 Spare Ribs (other meat choices are brisket, pork, or 1/4 chicken), Waffle Fries (there are 16 choices of Smokin Sides), and a drink for $10.99. The sausage or hot link was really tasty and they're not messing around with the heat! If you can't handle spicy food, watch out. I enjoyed the ribs as well, especially with their BBQ sauce. I definitely could've eaten more! I liked their offerings of sweetened and unsweetened iced tea as I mixed the two and had a nice balance.  We tried a couple cobblers, banana pudding, and the special Reese's PB bread pudding. The cobblers were all right and the banana pudding was decent. The bread pudding was off the hook though! Really good!  I think one of the best parts of their menu is the AYCE option for $24.99. It's offered all day, every day and has no restrictions (except no sharing or to-go, obviously). It's a ridiculous deal for meat! If I can get a few people together, I think that it would be a cool option to order all the types of meat and sides for everyone.",

I am happy to report that Rollin Smoke more than lived up to it's great reputation.  We arrived a little early (11:30am) for lunch, which was fortunate given that we just got ahead of the locals and the lunch rush. We ordered 4 different selections off the expansive menu and were all heartily pleased. Great brisket and pulled pork, amazing flavour, delicious sides. It is not fancy, mostly banquet seating but let's face it, BBQ is about taste, quality and selection.  For visitors without rental cars it is only a short taxi ride from the strip.  If you want a great BBQ experience at a reasonable price, Rollin Smoke is for you!",

Portions are way better than Dickeys BBQ but the sides/meat are cold/bland. The sauce us good though... btw doesn't taste/or looked like it came right of the grill either should have taken a picture before we tossed them... and, we called our orders in 15-20 minutes early... still had to wait extra 15 minutes when we got there... just not \"THE BOMB\" BBQ that everyone has been telling us. We spent $23+ for the 2 combo plates. Southern Pines North Carolina Dickeys BBQ has been the best for us. Sorry for the negative review but I had to tell the truth.

I was looking for that fall part goodness in your mouth bbq and well the only place that is good that i've had to far is Lucille's BBQ.  Oh well, another place to calk up....",

With stellar reviews and a line out the door, it had to be the bomb, right? Unfortunately, I really wanted to love this place but I just didn't. Based on reviews, I went early to avoid the lunch rush. Luckily, there was no line yet. Staff was very nice and kept checking on me while I was waiting on my colleagues. Didn't have to wait too long for our food and by that time ,sure enough, the line was out the door. I had the slider trio with pork, brisket and hot links. The pork and hot links were good, but nothing that different or special. The BBQ sauce was decent. I was completely disappointed with the brisket. It has so much fat in it that I didn't eat about half of it. Now mind you, I like leaner cuts of meat and I know some people like the fat, but this was just way too much. Those at the table also got the bacon potato salad, the waffle fries and the corn nuggets. All were just ok - nothing great.   If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll give it another try, but I won't go out of my way - it just wasn't worth it.",

The food is brought out to you fast and is delicious. We ordered the Outlaw Burger, the beef ribs and sides of greens and cornbread. The burger (which is HUGE)  is made of brisket and is topped with cabbage slaw, fried onion strings, chipotle aioli, lettuce and tomato and was perfectly cooked. The beef ribs come with two bones and are Flintstone size. They have the perfect amount of char and completely fall off the bone. The greens are cooked with brisket instead of bacon or ham and are well worth adding on as a side if not included with your meal choice. The cornbread was a little sweet for our taste but certainly good. Prices are very reasonable. As new residents of Las Vegas, we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas over the weekend for the husband's birthday. We found this place on one of our last trips and my husband put it on his must revisit list. When we went the 1st time we ended up getting an order of rib tips to share since we had an itinerary of places to try off the strip. The rib tips came out so tender and juicy. We got to try all of the sauces i loved the vinegar and peppers where my husband liked the mustard based sauce.  My husband noticed that they has an all you can eat option that featured everything on the menu. So that is what he wanted to do the next time we came to town.  The all you can eat is 35.99 which is very comparable to some of the buffets on the strip but the quality is so much better, for the AYCE you start with 3 meats and 2 sides, you have a hour time limit, you skip the line to order more, and you can pretty much get anything on the menu including desserts. Come hungry, they give you full size portions with every order.  My husband who can eat more then most people got full after the 2nd order but insisted on getting a few more things so he could say he tried all the meats on the menu.  My favorite are the burnt ends they are so worth it, (you usually have to pay more for them for most meals but they are included in the AYCE). The hubby loved the St. Louis ribs and the smoked meatloaf, but everything we had was pretty amazing.   We will be back just might not do the AYCE again.",

Let's say it's not a place I would wait an hour in line for, and we know we've all done that for some really good BBQ.  Anyway, decided on the rib special for $24.99 which came with 2 St. Louis ribs, 3 babybacks and I beef rib plus one side which we got waffle fries. We also added another beef rib for $6.  And for all those who really like BBQ, they also have AYCE anyday, anytime for $34.99.    The highlight of the dish was the beef rib.  The meat was fall off the bone super tender.  It tasted like what I expected from a beef rib, but it was lacking a rub or a bbq sauce that would have blown me away.  It was still good though just not great. The St. Louis ribs and babybacks were mediocre and but still tasty.  But based on just what we ordered I would have to say, I have definitely tried better BBQ but the place is worth giving a try.  The menu is huge, so even if your not craving BBQ, you can order other stuff like meatloaf or fried chicken.",

It's kind of industrial and out of the way, but you've got to get here for this incredible food, clean location, terrific customer service and fast preparation. We've already decided we're coming back here next time we're in Vegas.  Rollin Smoke BBQ is amazing! My sister and I shared the Trio plate of chicken and 2 portions of spare ribs. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the ribs fell off the bone and didn't need additional sauce (although I tried their sauces and liked them all)! We chose the Collard Greens as our 'included' side dish and they were delish!! We also ordered a side of the corn nuggets (creamed corn deep fried and a Must Have!). My dad had the scrumptious meatloaf plate that included tasty mashed potatoes, a huge piece of meatloaf that was full of flavor and fresh, handmade crispy fried onions smothering the meat along with a roll.  Chef Tim came out to check on the guests and I told him we were from Southern California and could not get over how delicious his food was. He asked if we ordered the Cornbread and we said we'd heard it was great but hadn't ordered it. He brought us each a piece and I can say that it was the best cornbread I have ever had. He said \"cake flour\"... \"that's all I'm saying\".  I told Chef Tim that my father loved the fried onions (which were, by then, gone) and that he was going to make a sandwich tomorrow out of his leftover meatloaf. Tim took the plate to box it up and when we got it back, there were 2 pieces of bread (to make a sandwich) and a huge pile of fried onions, in addition to my dad's leftovers! LIke I said, GREAT customer service!!  Then Chef Tim asked us and a few other folks if we wanted a tour, so we got to go back and see & smell the hickory wood and gorgeous meats in the smokers.  GO HERE!! You will be soooo happy you went!",

I shouldn't have done that because the portions are BIG! and you are not allowed to order more unless you finish your plate! The food was delicious but there was a lot!   I started with the ribs that were easy to come off the bone and had a nice sauce to it. I loved the breaded catfish because the tarter sauce had a nice lemony taste to it. Bacon potato salad which also had a bit of chives sprinkled on the top. I like my potato salad chunky and not too creamy so it was perfect!   The dessert was a hit and miss the black berry cobbler looked murky but I tried it and I wasn't too impressed. It tasted a little sour for me.  I liked that banana pudding better.    Some advice is to buy a la carte if you know that you can't eat a lot. I felt uncomfortable after the meal because I over ate. If I was to do it all over again I would get the catfish especially , potato salad and the banana pudding. Those were my standouts out of everything I ate.   I liked that there wasn't really a wait and we were served right away! The service was wonderful ! They kept  checking on us to see if we needed anything which was awesome!",

First let me start by saying the devor atmosphere & over all customer service is awesome even though the bigger dining room is warmer than the air conditioned dining area. I took several pictures because I was excited about finally being there. We ordered our food which came up to $40.00 a bit pricey but we thought we were going to enjoy it & we thought for sure we'd get a bigger portion at least some to take home but we were wrong and very dissapointed First of all I expected our food to be hot off the grill which it wasn't which tells me they didn't bring our food out right away. The taste of the food was average to me but to my boyfriend the \"Food Critic\" forget it!  There was so much fat on the ribs I ordered that I had to keep spitting chunks out into my napkin, the bacon potatoes salad was very disappointing to me as it had no flavor what's so ever. My boyfriend was so dissatisfied & disgusted he didn't even finish his plate which is rare because he's a big guy & a food lover like myself.... Will we go back? Never....what a shame I give this place 2 stars because they give a free souvenir cup for your beverage & I liked the decor but over all very dissatisfied",

A worker noticed we were still waiting for our food for a while and asked for our names so he could check up on our food. He said the Outlaw burger takes a bit more time to cook and put together. Soon after he gave us our food and some stickers too.  I had the bbq nacho fries. They were loaded with brisket, sour cream and cheese. My boyfriend had the outlaw burger. You definitely get your money's worth with that one. We also got mac and cheese for a side. Kind of a small portion but still really yummy. You might as well make it a combo for $3 to add a drink and side. A drink is $2 and a side is $2.50 so might as well make it a combo to get more bang for your buck!  Only complaint is that they need to expand! They've got so many people coming through that we had to stand and wait for a bit til people left so that we could sit and eat.",

Tried the catfish, pulled pork, chopped brisket, and hot link. I wasn't terribly crazy about the hot link, and the brisket was a little underwhelming, I would probably try it sliced next time. The food came out fast, and hot. And the service was top notch!  Always asking if we were good. We will definitely give this another go.",

Opted for the short ribs and brisket with cheesy mac and cheese as the side.  - The meat lacked any flavor and was completely missing that \"Wow\" factor we experienced on  each previous visits. Plus the meat was actually lukewarm, like it had been sitting out for a bit.  The short ribs were still good, but the brisket was very disappointing.  - Plus it seems like the portion sizes have gotten smaller. We both looked at our plates and said at the same time, \"That's it?\". Hmmmm. - Personal pet peeve of mine: Dropped 4 singles into the toke jar and never even received an acknowledgement. I work for tips and thank EVERYBODY who tokes. It is just rude not to.  I really hope I just caught them on an off day, but now I am going to start exploring other options when craving good BBQ. This was just a very underwhelming experience.  2 stars.  I have experienced better.",

The location is not the best and is pretty hidden but as soon as you walk into the establishment you get that southern style feel. They have several choices so we opted to go for the 5 meat pot special that comes with 3 sides. The sides we got were the Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and there corn nuggets. Every single thing was mouth watering and filled with flavor. The CORN NUGGETS are a MUST try. There was so much food we couldn't finish it all. I loved the taste and ambiance and will definitely be back with more people!",

    "text": "For the restaurant locations, whether the original location (Highland), first off, before you even get out of you vehicle, you start smelling the smoke from the smokers, for the Flamingo location, you are in for a treat.  As for the food, the smoke ring around the pulled pork was thick, and a dark pink color made my mouth water.  The melt in your mouth texture was second only to the flavor which was great.  Although the pork did not need BBQ sauce, I enjoyed the flavor of dipping it into the spicy BBQ sauce.  The beef ribs, or as I call them, the ribs from the Flintstones, are HUGE, tender, and flavorful.  I could go on about the Brisket, Meatloaf (made with the Brisket), etc, but by now you should already be in your car driving to one of the locations and I wouldn't want you reading this and driving at the same time.  As for the catering (Catfish Cory), seeing as the smokers were attached to the truck that catered it, you couldn't get a fresher meal.  Literally, off the smoker onto your plate.  The quality of the BBQ in Las Vegas is unmatched.",

We ordered a few things to try, but my favorites were the burnt ends and St. Louis ribs. The St. Louis ribs are dry rubbed and the sweet and spicy sauce was perfect for dipping. My bf liked the vinegar sauce but it wasn't really my thing. We got the brisket three ways but ended up ordering more of the burnt ends because they were really good!   For our sides, we got the waffle fries, corn nuggets, corn bread, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. I loved all the sides but the corn nuggets were really good! I've never had something like it before, but it's basically creamed corned that's deep fried into nuggets.",

Also, try the beef ribs, two feeds a big guy quite well, four feeds a small family! No beer at this place so byob. Finally, I gave this place a 5-star based on value and flavor, however, the burger is excellent without the deep fried onions on it. In fact, it's too big, it's scary just looking at it. Overall, take a jaunt off the strip and visit this place, in my traveled opinion, I would say that they have no rivals west of the Mississippi.  Of course,  this is just my opinion. :-)",

I always received great service from ordering to receiving my food. Aside from the fact it's not located in the best of areas, the parking lot is always packed.  Can you blame them? Not at all.  When you want some of the best BBQ, you will make it to Rollin Smoke for a taste of their smoky and tender feast.     Of course there is the monstrous Outlaw Burger.  Have you seen the pics? It's large and in charge.  By the end you're probably using utensils to gobble up the tasty meat but it's definitely worth it.  I would definitely suggest sharing.    My other favorite is their meatloaf.  You're probably thinking 'C'mon... Meatloaf?' Oh yeah.  It's combination of smoky meats baked, placed on loaded mash and topped with sauce and onion straws.  It's mouth watering fantastic.    I have yet to find something here I didn't like.  When I try other BBQ places around the city, none compare to the great Rollin Smoke!",

As you enter, you place your order as how you would in a fast food joint.  You get you own fountain drink, take the plastic spoons & forks, and plates. They bring your food to your table and you dig in! The food is very superb! THE BARBEQ OF BARBECUES and we are not disappointed.  We ordered the Pit special (5 different meats) plus three sides (your choice). The barbecue flavor is amazing and this place doesn't under deliver. In fact, I think they over deliver!!! Yummy food!!!  The other patrons in this place are all very friendly too. Attitudes are all very kind and positive.  A very well recommended place for locals and visitors alike to visit and I guarantee that you will be liking the barbecue sauce off of your fingers in no time, just like we did!",

Loaded potato was a complete let down. First off you're gonna tell me that gross form of bright orange \"liquid cheese\" is better than actual grated cheddar? Nope. Then there's the skin - if you are a person who actually enjoys a crispy potato skin DO NOT - there is so much salt on the exterior it makes your tongue go a little numb. The brisket was maybe the sweet flavor that I got every few bites, but it's hard to tell b/c the minuscule crumbles they call brisket.  The hubs ordered the 2 meat plate so I did get a fantastic bite of the pork but that could be b/c everything else was a total let down. The waffle fries were also the way to go, as the mac & cheese must be made with the same liquid as already mentioned.  Lastly the canned peach cobbler was a joke, coming in at $7 for dried biscuit-ish bread in a swamp of overly sweet something.. and off brand ice cream.  There are way too many other places in Vegas to waste your time and money here.",

The brisket in the sandwich was very finely chopped instead of being sliced and it contained too much fat and gristle. I tried to doctor it up with their BBQ sauce but I didn't much care for the sauce which I assume is made in house.  With all the favorable reviews, I have to believe that all of Rollin' Smoke's menu items just can't be as bad as that brisket. So I may give them another try to sample some of their other items. And I'll bring some of my own BBQ sauce with me. If I do, I'll update this review.",

We got there around 12:30pm, and surprisingly it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be. This place is a order and sit down place. My sister and I wanted to share one of the plates. We chose the three meats: pork, brisket, and 2 spare ribs with mashed potatoes and beans on the side. The service is excellent; they greet you, call you by your name and make sure you are taken care of. I believe it's family own if I'm not mistaken. Our food came out pretty quick and we didn't have to wait that long at all. The food was delicious and the meats are perfect! Don't forget to get some sauces on the side (spicy and mama's sweet sauce). The plates here are definitely shareable (if you want to share). You could also order to-go and catering as well. I will certainly be back next time or order to-go for a party!",

I should of ate hers and i probably would have been just fine and told her, \"well honey you did say you wanted to stick to your diet right?\" jk.

The brisket was Ok, a little dry but had flavor.   We got the corn nuggets which were nice and crisp on the outside and awesome on the inside. One of the best side dishes I've had.  The mac and cheese was awesome too, with shredded cheese on top to add more gooey-ness to the mix.  The peach cobbler was fantastic also.

    "text": "After hearing the hype for the past couple years and seeing this place featured on TV, I was really excited to come sample some delicious Q, especially since the line to eat at Caesar's buffet was 7 hours long. The Q here isn't sauced and tends to run a little on the drier side, relying primarily on dry rub and smoke for flavor, but they have a variety of sauces to moisturize your meat. We ordered a little of everything, here's the breakdown:  Spareribs: probably one of the better meats here, it's a little dry but with solid rub seasoning, decently flavorful. Pulled pork: my favorite meat option, probably because it was the right balance of smoke and natural pork flavor, appropriately tender. Baby back ribs: too dry, more than a bit of a letdown. Smoked chicken: we got white meat, so the dry theme continues. My lady friend said it basically had no flavor, I didn't think it was actually fairly decent. Brisket: could be more tender, and not nearly as seasoned as the other meats. Hot links: essentially smoky and spicy kielbasa, not bad but nothing earth shattering Burger: this may have been the highlight between me and my lady friend, they use a combo of smoked brisket with ground beef to make the patty so the burger has a depth of flavor that you wouldn't otherwise typically expect. It's practically impossible to eat without a knife and fork given the mountain of onion strings on top, but that's not really a serious complaint. Mac and cheese: nothing special, a little on the watery side, needs some seasoning. Corn nuggets: these things are like crack, I could eat these all day. Not nearly as creamy in the center as ones I've had in the past, but the sweetness and textured crispiness are on point. Corn bread: I want to say the bottom is soaked in a light honey syrup, fairly moist, I'd consider it a win.  We walked out with nearly 2/3rds of our food as leftovers, which is probably better for my health but a bit of a disappointment since it means I didn't try to gorge myself to exploding. I don't know if this is the best that Vegas has to offer for Q, but I'll probably hold off on coming back here unless my friends really feel the need to satisfy their smoked meat cravings the next time we're in town.",

    "text": "I don't know what happened but I had a totally different experience at Rollin Smoke then everyone else seems to have had.  We ordered rib tips, links, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potato salad, coleslaw, peach cobbler and caramel cake all to go.  It took over 45 min for our order to be ready.  I would think the sides and desserts are already prepared and just need to scooped in a container.  So the wait was for links and rib tips?  The smokers were not on when we were there so we weren't waiting for meat.    Customer service could have been friendlier.  They customer in front of me asked what sides they had and the guy taking orders just hit the menu where the sides were listed.  I wanted a link and sides but was told I had to get the hotlink sandwich.  I asked \"So I can't just get a link?\"  He said no not really.  When I pressed the issue he said I can get a 2 item combo and just get all hotlink.  I ordered that but why not just sell a link for $3 or $4 bucks?  After 40 min of waiting and seeing people order after me get their food I asked how long it would be and was told very gruffly that they are \"very busy\".  They were busy but I ordered before the lunch rush started.  I was also sitting in the booth next to the register so I could hear the orders and knew who was picking up phone orders, etc.  Also during the 45 min I waited at least 5 people told him the coke was out.  It was still out when I left.    Ok.  On to the most important part the food.  Cause really, I will wait for hours and put up with bad service for some awesome BBQ.    Sweet Tea- Not good.  I actually switched to soda and I rarely drink soda.    Rib tips- Hubby thought they were ok.  I'm not a big beef rib person but thought they were ok also.  `  Links- No way that was 2 portions of links from my 2 meat combo.  It wasn't even 1 small link total.  But that is ok since they were so dried out it looked like they were days old.  I have never seen meat that dry in my entire life.  I'm being generous to say they looked like they were sliced the day before and left in the warmer overnight.    Mac n cheese- very bland, noodles overcooked, could have used salt or real cheese.    Mashed Potatoes-  Instant.  Yes they use instant potatoes.  All the other stuff there is good.  If they would use real potatoes it would probably be amazing.    Potato Salad- This was the best out of all the sides.  It was ok but wouldn't order it again.    Coleslaw- Ok.    Peach cobbler- Cold.  Who serves cold peach cobbler?  Again ok.  Not great.    Caramel Cake- Yellow cake topped with caramel syrup, like the kind you buy for sundaes.  This was actually not bad.  I might even try it at home.    All the sides seemed just a little spice away from being good.  Maybe I went on an off day.  I don't know.  After reading everyone's reviews I was so excited to come here and had high hopes for what I thought was going be my new favorite BBQ place.  I was heartbroken at how bad it was.  At some point I will try again cause these 5 stars reviews have to mean something.  But I'm gonna need my yelpers to go with me cause hubby isn't having it.",

Once we got in, we were greeted by one of the owners and we were very pleased.   We both ordered the Duo. The brisket was fantastic. Tender, moist and very flavorful. The ribs were fall off the bone good. They definitely take pride in what they serve. The Mac n cheese was great and well. Went perfect with the meal.   You order at the counter and they deliver your meal to you. We talked to the young man quite a bit and it sounds like they have had quite a nice little success. This is a hidden gem in Vegas.

Even as a sometime vegetarian/full time pescetarian, the smell from the car park smokers was intoxicating.   One could say the air was moist with flavors...Huh?!?! Ya had to be there. They do have moist towelettes which I grabbed (forgetting the crew I was with) for post feast clean up.   They were out of greens and the fish and okra were deep fried (will try another day) so I opted for the yams, jalapeno slaw and baked beans: the latter has some type of meat in it, tried my best to pick it out, but veggies be aware. They also had Smoked Tabasco on the table = went right into my moist jalapeno slaw! Love hot sauce :))   Service was very friendly and checked on us frequently - even one of the owners! The unsweetened fresh brewed tea was delicious. Nibbled a piece of corn bread and all of the carnivores loved their bones, pulled pork, smoked meatloaf etc...Misti gave the Southern gal stamp of approval to the okra.   Still offering dessert with Yelp check in and the banana pudding looked old school divine, and moist!  Can't wait to come back and try more options and bring carnivore friends. I'm sure they will appreciate the moist delicious meat! There may not be \"Sex in the Champagne Room\" next door, but there's terrific down-home eats till 1:30AM on weekends, guaranteed!!!  Yelp 100 Challenge  Ed. Note: the word \"moist\" was used in this review many times because one should never share phobias/words that creep you out etc with Yelpers and expect to remain unscathed (in a good natured way :)))",

It's been on my list for a long time and I finally made it down here to see what the hype is all about and I can honestly say the hype is real. I mean you can smell the smoke all throughout the restaurant and all the way outside. We came on a Friday night and it wasn't packed but there were people coming and going the entire time. Me and the boyfriend decided to share a 4 meat combo with three sides which is a really good deal for 19.99. You can sample almost all the meats the have to offer. Almost not all. We chose hot links, pulled pork, spare ribs and brisket. Choosing sides I couldn't decide so quick and they were more than happy to let me sample both the fried okra and the corn nuggets. Easy winner there the corn nuggets are so fricking delicious! Sweet cream corn inside fried crispy with almost a beer batter exterior. The BOMB! We seated ourselves and the food came out not too much longer after. My favorite has to be the ribs. Fall apart tender and just the right amount of smoke. The brisket could have been more tender and the pulled pork was lacking in smoky flavor but still very good. I'm not a fan of hot links but these were pretty good. The greens were delicious and tender and the mac and cheese was very creamy. I prefer a less creamy mac and cheese but it was still good. My favorite were those corn nuggets. I could eat those all day but I don't think that would be a good idea. I asked for some chipotle dipping sauce and it was the perfect condiment. Sweet corn nuggets with a spicy smoky dipping sauce. I guess we were still hungry because. My boyfriend ordered more pulled pork and ribs with greens of course since I had the Mac and cheese. Service was great they called us by name the entire time and were super nice. The food is legit I just wish they had a better location.",

A mere 5 weeks ago I posted a rave review on this business and its food; however, I must take a step back today from my initial review, but not because the food isn't any less than great.  I can understand the rapid success of a business making ownership proud of their product, but the immense price increases noted on the new menu (3rd increase in just a few months that I am aware of) are quite staggering to say the least! On 7/9/15 I ordered a 3 meat plate w/one side and drink for $13; yesterday, that same 3 meat meal \"deal\" came w/one side for $17.99, AN INCREASE OF 5 BUCKS and NO DRINK???? Not a single person in line when I ordered and still a 10 minute wait for my smaller 2 meat plate order (only due to new  price increase).   Similar price increases across the board on most all menu items; has success spoiled RSB so much that it has decided to cash in now at the expense of the customers who helped them get there or is this just another case of ownership killing the goose that lays the golden eggs?  Great barbecue; YES. Worth the wait and $$$; sadly, not for me anymore.",

    "text": "I love Rollin Smoke! After spending half a year in Texas, my standards for barbeque have gone up quite a few notches. I didn't expect to find a place that would be on par with good 'ol Texas, but Rollin Smoke definitely takes the award for best barbeque in Las Vegas.   One of the best things about this place is the staff. Everyone that works there is super friendly, and loves having a conversation with you while they're taking your order. It creates an ambience that really makes you feel at home, which a lot of Vegas restaurants are lacking in.   You have many different options to choose from including AYCE but honestly, you'd have to come extremely hungry to manage that one. My go to is the three meat combo, which gives you any three meats of your choice, bread, and a side. It's good for those who like a little variety, but also want a little extra to take home. I usually stick with burnt ends a.k.a the only way to eat brisket, ribs, and whatever else I'm feeling that day. They put a little bit of sauce on it for you, but there's also bottles of barbeque sauce at the table so you can go as crazy as you'd like.   If you're in town and looking for some great barbeque, definitely give Rollin Smoke a try. You won't be disappointed.",

The food and the southern welcome to Rollin smoke is most memorable! Highly recommend you get some of this ! ....ya like now!

    "text": "I don't know if I liked Rollin Smoke BBQ because I had a couple of beers before dining here.  And, I don't know if I liked it because of the people I was dining with.  Again, I don't know if I liked Rollin Smoke BBQ because sitting next to me was Christie O. who doesn't eat pork.  And, trying to tempt her into turning to the \"Darkside\" was my goal - no success though.  But, what I do know, is that I liked Rollin Smoke BBQ.   I had a couple of pork ribs, bacon potato salad, white bread and a diet soda.  The sauce wasn't overwhelming or overpowering.  So, the pork came through.  BACON POTATO SALAD... that won me over.  Anything with bacon is so much better.    The service was awesome as well.  The girl behind the counter was smiling the whole time she was taking our orders.  The food was delivered with that same smile.  Does it get any better than that.  I think not.  And, to be open late, to boot? Come on... awesome!  So, I don't care what the reason is, that I like Rollin Smoke BBQ.  I like it and I'll definitely return.",

As you may already know about me, I am a first-rate barbecue snob ...the kind of guy who is first to correct anybody who confuses grilling with barbecuing.  That is not a concern here.  We're talking about brisket and pork that is smoked for 18 hours -- baby back, pork *and* beef ribs -- wickedly good sides (like jalapeno coleslaw and corn nuggets) -- even some unique sandwiches.  It's in an odd part of town, off of Highland and under the Desert Inn overpass (yes, surrounded by strip clubs & warehouses) but somehow the location just seems to work.   Make no mistake:  this is the absolute best barbecue that you will find in Las Vegas.  Period.   If you like legit barbecue then you need to judge this place for yourself.    You're welcome.",

You can't miss the big smokers out front though, sitting in the parking lot like beasts of barbecue.   You go inside and like a magical mirror, the place is so much bigger in than out, with a side room and front room with tables and chairs to hang out in.  NOW, the amazing part, the part that astounds is the BBQ!  I don't believe I have ever had better BBQ sauce...EVER.  The brisket wasn't tender but delicious, the hot link was extraordinary and the beans had chunks of beef that were staggering.  Everyone in our group (there were 9 of us) shut right up and dug in (although keeping the 5th star away for now was the somewhat unorganized service).  If you love BBQ, there is NONE better in Vegas, or maybe even in the great state of Nevada.  Heck, I would put it up against the little smoke houses in my wife's hometown of Nashville!  Truly superb food and the banana pudding at the end was heaven itself.  If you are into \"fancy\" you don't know BBQ anyway so this aint for you.  IF YOU WANT the best tasting BBQ in town though, this is the place for you!   GET SOME!!!",

    "text": "Delicious.  Went here after reading the reviews and since I am always on the lookout for good bbq in vegas.  Now, some people might say there is better bbq in KC or Texas, etc.  Well, I am rating it based on the fact that it is objectively very good, and definitely the best I have had in Las Vegas.  I got the \"biggun'\" sandwich, which had pulled pork, brisket and hot link.  The hot link was delicious and did not have the overly greasy and oily nature of a standard hotlink, which are often like kielbasas.  The meat was very good as was the sauce.  I had a couple pieces of brisket that were a little overcooked, but overall it was excellent.  I also had some of their st Louis ribs, which were tasty.  Flavorful, tender and fall off the bone, although a little fatty...but that is what you generally get with st Louis ribs.  Fried okra and greens were very good as well, and they had a ton of other sides.  Unfortunately they were out of the cobbler and pudding, so I did not get to try those despite all the claims of excellence. Now, they location and decor are not exactly phenomenal, but I suppose it is what they could afford starting out.  It is close to the strip also which is good if you are in that area.  Overall, super friendly and very delicious, but definitely expensive for BBQ.  Best bbq I have had in vegas though.",

    "text": "Amazing food! Incredible service! Stop reading this and go there now, you won't be sorry.   Las Vegas did not have Barbeque until Rolling Smoke opened, thank God they are here.  Everything about this place is GREAT!  I could go on for paragraphs about the food.  We ordered some of everything,  even the catfish.   Brisket - AMAZING (not fatty,  cooked perfect),  Pulled Pork - OUT OF THIS WORLD, Spare Ribs - MOUTH WATERING, Chicken- VERY GOOD (it may have been touch dry but I couldn't tell because I covered it in their delicious sauce), Catfish - one of the best I have had,  light crispy and flavored perfect a  definite surprise for a BBQ joint.  There is basically no dish on the menu that you can go wrong with, even the sides were great.  Now about the service:  I was worried when we pulled up;  the place is small and there was literally a line out the door (Saturday night dinner).  Remarkably,  the line was so quick we barely waited - I don't know how they did it but it was perfect.  We got amazing personal service and it was quick (figure that one out).  If the food is amazing,  then the service is AMAZING x10!  After we placed out order our waiter,  a younger guy with blonde dread lock type hair, delivered it to our table.  The place was packed,  I had been watching the waiter and he never stood still  or stopped moving,  it was BUSY but he took the time to tell us about each dish and came back 3 times to see if we liked everything. Not only did he come by the but the Chef came over to each table to welcome the customers,  tell them about the dishes and make sure they liked everything.  We even had one more guy from the kitchen come over and check on us.  It was amazing service,  you just don't get service like that in Vegas anymore.  You can see everyone obviously loves their job and loves that restaurant - the attitude a made the place fun and enjoyable to a whole different level.  I can't say enough good things about our waiter,  he was 5 star service and just a nice guy- we would probably go back for him alone but the food is the shining star of this place.  The only regret I have is that I forgot to buy Barbeque sauce to take home,  good excuse to go back this week :)",

This place is great, but I did take off a star for no table service, they just bring out your order. Now back to the important part--THE BBQ. Outstanding  covers it quite well. I got the Trio, the brisket, the thinner slices were juicy and smoky, the one thick slice was a little tough and dryer, not sure why. Ribs were meaty and good with the bbq sauce applied, which was a little thin for my taste, but flavorful. The sauce brought out more flavor, but flavor dropped off alot with no sauce, but still good though. And finally the hot link, I think WOW covers it. A lot of flavor, right amount of heat and perfect snap. As for the sides, beans were great, potato salad just OK, could have cooked potatoes a few minutes longer, were just under crunchy, but flavor was good. Overall absolutely will go back, but Famous Daves ribs are still better, not sure why, will have to try both again and report back.",

    "text": "Went there on January 20, 2015.  Been to Vegas many, many times.  We stay on the strip and pretty much always eat in the many restaurants/hotels on it. A few months before this trip saw Rollin Smoke on TV on one of the many food shows. I \"adore\", appreciate, and seek out authentic BBQ joints. The real stuff is not easy to find. Well this is it! The place is a dive and small. There were 3 of us and finding a table, even though they were busy with diners and take out orders, was easy. The various sides we had were good. The proof though is in the meats and it did not disappoint. The pulled pork, chicken, spare ribs, brisket and beef ribs were outstanding. They do not overload their rub with salt like way too many other places do. That potentially does not only tend to dry out the meat, but it overwhelms the flavor of it. Here it's perfect balance. Most BBQ places do not offer beef ribs. If you've never had one it's a must. These are not the beef ribs you might see in your grocery store's meat case. Those hardly have any meat on them before cooking, let alone after. These are short ribs. Yes, these you find in your grocery, but they are cut into short pieces for slow cooking and braising. I have never seen them in the case in full rack. I have a home smoker and I get them from my grocer and ask for the pack that they then get out of the cooler for me. These contain the full four rib rack.  \"Short\" has to do with where it comes from on the cow, not the length. But because we always see them cut up, its easy to make that connection.  Matter of fact, while not quite Fred Flinstone's bronto ribs that tips his car over, they're the closest thing to it.  They are 8\" - 10\" long and loaded with meat. While a slab of spare ribs stay in a smoker for about 4 hours, beef ribs have so much meat they are in there for 8+ hours. So next time in Vegas, take a cab or your rental car and go here.  We try to get to Vegas once or twice a year and now this will be added as one of our \"must\" eating places on every trip.  From Rollin Smoke to Caesar's Bacchanal buffet!",

Has the huge rush of people made them slack just a little, yes. The last 2 visits just weren't that amazing food that I experienced the 5 times prior. I love the meatloaf. The catfish is hit or miss. It's been bomb many times, then soggy on one occasion. And I am not 100% sure of this, but I swear they HAD beef hot links and now I think its pork? Both are decent links, I just prefer the beef. No biggie. The sauce, well it always has been and still is, an all around GREAT sauce.  I am happy for the success of these guys. But I miss when it has been just the family back there cooking, making sure every meal was perfect. The service is still pretty good. They really seem to handle the stress of a crazy, busy, demanding BBQ joint really well. I have never had bad service, EVER.  A couple tips, get the beef ribs if you want ribs, they are huge and great.  Even though the AYCE price is not $35, if you can handle all that meat, GO FOR IT! Still a great deal. Get one of each side, because they are all good. I am a big fan of the loaded potatoes and jalapeno slaw.  I just read they are partnering with Gold & Silver Pawn to open a second location. I look forward for what's to come.",

The pork was tender with no hard ends. It had plenty of moisture but not heavy rendered fat. The smoke flavor was good but not overwhelming. The brisket had good smoke penetration and the pink ring didn't overpower the flavor. Just the right smoke. Finally the hot link was hot enough without canceling out the flavors.   Overall well played. Worth the wait. The sauce on the table had flavor with just a little heat. The location has zero parking and the dinning area is challenging.   I still love this and would rate it up with the like if the Salt Lick in Driftwood TX. A must visit.",

It's our first time and already were planning on our next trip (probably on our next day off).  The location is quite hidden, but thanks to Siri we found it with no problem.  The restaurant is small but there are outside seating/dining area.  There is a big menu, which we needed a minute to read.  But don't sweat, there's something for everyone.   Long story short, come to this place hungry.  If you're looking for a salad, please stay away.  Some whiney guy was complaining about how he couldn't order a salad his way.  Seriously, if you're worried about eating a salad at a barbecue place, you have bigger issues than just a salad homie.    I gave minus points for the lack of space in the restaurant, but it's not a deal breaker.",

We ordered the trio meats (chicken, pork, and ribs) with corn nugget, loaded mashed potato and a side salad (BBQ vinegrette dressing). You order your food and then find a seat. My husband ate most of the meat and rated it a 3.5-4 stars. The meats were tasty with variety of different dipping sauces you can choose from; the only negative was the dark chicken meat was a little dry. The corn nuggets were different as we have never had them before. You expect it to be salty but because of the corn it is sweet. The mashed potato was good if you like yours smooth and not chunky. We tried the sweet tea based on several reviews. It was super sweet and tasted like the Asian grass jelly drinks. We were expecting it to be a cold Canadian ice tea but with the adjustments we made it was good. My husband had to add ice and 1/3 cup water just to make it the right amount of sweetness and temperature as we wanted a cold drink. It's a little out of the way in the middle of nowhere, but if you are craving for some meat it's worth a visit for lunch.",

Hopefully one day I'll get to try them.   Bbw chicken. It's not a whole chicken. It's 8 separate pieces. Very tasty and moist.   They were also out of the baked potato the night we ordered   Brisket.  I ordered 2 lbs to make up for the lack of beef ribs. The brisket was dry and had a very bad after taste that made it taste like old meat that had been. I tried to mask it with the delicious sauce but I couldn't. It wasn't the smoke flavor. It just tasted like old meat that should have been thrown out.  The brisket has a very light smoke ring. Little to no bark. It was definitely not winning any awards.   The sides were all ok. Nothing is ever crave but decent.   I asked them for a variety of sauces but they only included one type.   I'd go back but only because I'm still want to try the ribs.   The brisket was one of the worst I've ever had.  (Two pounds ended up in the trash). The chicken was good but over priced in my opinion.",

We ordered the brisket pulled, ribs, and baked beans with a side of corn bread. Often times with BBQ the meat can be cold or be tough because it has been sitting for a while; this was not the case. It was absolutely finger lickin' delicious.  The ribs are incredible don't  waste your time beating around the bush go for the gold and this ribs are it. I recommend the Sweet Carolina BBQ Sauce, it was my favorite. The corn bread is light like and angel cake texture almost, its surprisingly scrumptious it really soaks ups the other foods well.

The restaurant was featured on a television show named Tanked recently. Tanked is a show about building custom aquariums for people and businesses, and the one they did for Rollin Smoke is full of exotic fish and is in their newly expanded room.  The outlaw burger is a must try if you're just visiting from another city. It's basically a meatloaf type burger with onion rings on top, and tastes just amazing.   For those of you that have already had the outlaw burger, I suggest getting the multiple meat platter with some sides. I like to get ribs, brisket, and chicken.  I would have given this place five stars last year, but this year it's four stars because they are always busy now, the lions are getting longer, and the portions seem to be getting smaller. They also changed their sweet potato side recipe, and I like the first version of this not the new one.  Regardless, I'm still going to continue to come back because there is no barbecue place like it anywhere near this part of town.",

I was kinda bored waiting in line for ten minutes, but after seeing others eating the food as I waited, I knew the wait would be worth it. One thing in particular caught my eye. I spotted it from across the room and knew we were meant for each other.  I ordered the outlaw burger, which was both inexpensive and amazing. This was easily one of the biggest burgers I have ever eaten. It has beef and brisket, onion straws, slaw and more on it. It towers over lesser burgers with a majestic stature that ensures you will be in mind blowing pain after eating this thing all in one sitting, which I of course did. The burger came with tasty waffle fries for around $9.  I so wish this place opened by me in NC, although if it did, I'd be 500lbs. I will return when I hit up Vegas again.",

I got the 3 Meat Trio and choose: Ribs, Brisket, and Chicken. Brisket and Chicken were very flavorful, but the Ribs were more fat than meat.   They have a few BBQ sauces to choose from, but I typically prefer my BBQ without sauce, to savor the authentic smoked flavor, which this place does deliver on. I tried once of the sauces, but it was nothing to write home about. Side were just okay. Had the Beans and Mac and Cheese. Beans were better than the latter. Mac and Cheese was kinda cold and really didn't have the flavor I wanted. Plus I don't know why the shredded it added. See pics others have taken.  It's definitely worth a stop if you're in Vegas.

I have the one girl the benefit of the doubt because she seemed new,  or maybe a little slow, but I'm not a harsh yelper, so I didn't really take any stars off for the service. The cool factor made up for any mistakes.  But the ribs were dry.  I mean dry.  Babyback ribs from Costco should fall off the bone.  These were dry and tough.  The flavor was there,  but dude.  The pulled pork was good,  and I liked the Mac and cheese.  But you can't f up ribs at a bbq place and keep my 5 star rating.  Sorry.",

    "text": "Totally found this place by accident.  After a long day at a conference, I asked Siri for a barbecue restaurant near my location in Las Vegas.  This just happened to be the first one suggested, so we drove to it, about 1 1/2 miles away.  We turned onto Highland and thought this wasn't the nicest neighborhood in town, but saw that Rollin' Smoke was a little hole in the wall in a small strip center.  After getting out of the car, we immediately caught a whiff of the smoky goodness we were about to experience...always a good sign.  We looked at the menu and decided to go in anyway...so glad we did!  The baby back ribs I had were tender, smoky and flavorful.  A little extra house BBQ sauce made it even better, even though they are good when eaten dry too.  The only negative was that the thin membrane on the bottom of the bone wasn't pulled off...although it's a time-consuming process, it could have allowed additional smoke to the bottom of the meat, too.  My colleagues shared a sampler platter and thought it was some of the best BBQ they've had...and remarked that the baked beans were THE best they've ever had.  I can't disagree, comparing it only to SmoQue (Chicago) BBQ's brisket beans.  Awesome.  Anyway, this was definitely a welcome surprise, finding this place without reading reviews or being referred beforehand.  Worth the visit.",

The presentation of the food was nice. The bar bbq sauces were delicious. Would I recommend? Not based on this experience.",

I definitely know what I am getting next time I am out here. Thanks Antonio for helping me out! I can definitely say I will be ordering the burnt ends again, with some dirty rice!",

They actually have Burnt Ends, which has been surprisingly hard to find, and the flavor is excellent.  I only wish they had more locations so I don't have to drive as far when I get the urge for BBQ. Hopefully they'll open some in Summerlin and the NW area soon.  Until then it's worth the extra drive.",

This was the best I've had in quite some time but doesn't quite reach the pinnacle that is Oklahoma joes.  We ordered the smoked meatloaf-very good but VERY smokey. It was like it was cooked over a campfire. Also tried the outlaw burger- this was amazing. Too big to realistically eat in one bite so just take the onion strings off and eat those as a side.  You must order the corn nuggets, they are the best I've ever had.",

There are a couple tables outside and a handful of tables inside...but, be warned, open seats and tables are at a premium at times as this place gets packed because they are just THAT good! I ate there for dinner yesterday and woke up craving their food...agh! The beef bones were out of this world flavorful and tender...the meat just fell off the bones. I wanted to try the bacon potato salad and they were out of it so I tried macaroni and cheese and yams...these are now my favorite sides. They brought us an order of potato salad after they made a new batch, but I liked the yams and macaroni and cheese the best. The owners and staff are very welcoming and friendly and stop by the tables to get feedback from their diners...when they spoke to us, they informed us that they are opening a second location that will include a bar. Of all the many places I've had the pleasure of eating BBQ this makes my list of my top three favorites...the other two are in (1) San Diego and (2) Winnipeg, Manitoba. Give this place a shot...I'm so glad I did!",

I know BBQ, I grew up in Texas, worked when I was in college at a BBQ joint, have spent many a meal eating it, and have had vacations planned around parts of this country just to eat it!  In the past, baby back ribs, brisket, and hot links or sausage was the best for me. I'm still partial to ribs, but love a good smoked brisket. This place has some of the best in Las Vegas. They leave just enough fat to keep it moist, you pick it up and it falls apart! It's got a good smoke ring and blackened skin to make your mouth water.   Just about everything on the menu makes my mouth water. We usually order by the pound and get a side or two, yes between my husband and myself, we can put it away. But we do have some left overs. We like eating here often but because we can order by the pound, we can watch carbs as well.   Very causal, gets extremely busy especially at peak hours. Friendly staff. Good BBQ!",

We tried the 5 meat pit special and shared it between the two of us, it was plenty and it was delicious!  The corn bread, BBQ beans and collard greens were just as tasty as the meat-fest. The sweet tea was fresh brewed and perfect. Sometimes sweet tea can be overly sweet but this was spot on.  Don't let the location fool you, friendly people and fantastic BBQ.   Grab a cab and get out of the casino, you won't regret it if you like great BBQ. Highly recommend and will return the next time I am in town.",

The meat was tender and not dry and very flavorful. I had the huge pork sandwich and a side of collard greens. Unbelievable flavor, nice toasted bun, good Smokey flavored pulled pork. The sauces are also good, there are 4 to choose from anywhere from hot to mild and a Carolina vinegar style. If you are in town and like BBQ, believe me, you won't be disappointed.

You need some salt, pepper, garlic and onion power, plus your seasoning salt, bring it all. At least they have Coke products out come on",

The baked beans had their own flavor, not just beans with sauce poured on top.  The corn nuggets were the sweet in the meal.  Excellent! Husband had brisket 3 ways.  He is a BBQ snob and he too agreed that this was the best Q.   Being the best is hard work and this place kicks butt!  Good job!",

Price, portion, and taste is all on point for this business.  My hubby ordered a special of ribs and sweet potato pie for $20. His meal was okay, but mine?! Mine was fantastic! I paid an extra $3 for the burnt brisket tips by recommendation of the cashier, and she wasn't kidding. It was smoky, tender, and a bit spicy from the peppercorn crust. Since mine was a two item combo, I also got the pulled pork- not too salty, tender shreds of pork. Served with one slice of white bread and a side. I got the chipotle coleslaw since I wanted some greens with my heavy meal.   Order at the front, pay, find a table and self serve utensils and drinks. Easy, easy, easy!    This place is on the definite return list when we are back in town.",

Not entirely business' fault, as they have as many tables and benches crammed in as possible.  Other issue was the leaking cups.  We were told manufacturer defect, and they did replace the first leaky cup, but my replacement leaked worse. Stuck a napkin under as a coaster and called it a day.  Too bad I won't be able to reuse the cup.  On to the positives!!  The food was well prepared, very flavorful, and in great portions.  I chose the 2 meat combo (Brisket and Hot Link) with the potato salad.  The brisket was incredibly well prepared and very tender.  Got Link was cooked AND cut to perfection.  Sauces were bursting with flavor that enhanced the taste of the meats.  The service from cashiers were very nice and intimate too.  Each transaction was unique where the cashiers would create small talk to show appreciation and make the customer feel special.  For example, my friend before me, the cashier would talk about living in Las Vegas (he was born and raised).  Then, when I came up, he talked to me about my heritage and how it was applicable to him as well (based on my last name).  It was incredibly calming to know each customer is treated with respect and dignity.  Bravo!",

It's hard to appreciate until you try them. Everyone at my table loved them. They are so addicting. They also have a long list of other options including their own take on Mac N Cheese, mashed potatoes, baked beans, etc.  As far as the meat goes, I wasn't very impressed. All the BBQ I try is compared to Kansas City BBQ because that's the best I've ever had, and it just doesn't measure up here. However it's plausible that their claim, \"Best bbq in Las Vegas\" is True because it was a decent place that proudly displays awards they have won for their bbq.  I ordered The Outlaw Burger. It was insanely large. Basically it's a side order of onion straws on a burger. The taste of the meat was off otherwise I would have loved everything about this entree. I was only able to eat half of it before getting too full to continue.   If you're craving BBQ, this place will do the trick. Go check it out.",

Pasta prepared perfectly and the right amount of cheese. The ribs....the ribs!! They come with this dark char bark but not burnt. The bark has as much flavor as any ribs I've had before. The meat inside is tender and slides right of the bone! Spoke to one of owners. He told me how he tries to get just the right combo of the deep bark and tender middle. How he can't believe that his passion led to owning his own business in Vegas. This a must try if you're in town! Only draw back is it seems like seating can become limited during rush hours, unless you don't mind  community seating. Still an amazing find!",

    "text": "I moved out to Las Vegas a few months ago, and nothing has inspired me to write a review until now.   I did a cross country roadtrip where I was able to sample BBQ from some of the best southern BBQ joints I could find -- and Rollin Smoke BBQ is amazing! Not as good as Texan bbq, but this is just as close to the Lone Star state it'll get! WAYYYYYYYYY better than Famous Dave's. Oh boy, do I hate Famous Daves -- such an insult to BBQ.  Atmosphere -- super laid back, picnic table, and family style. Very casual dining.   Boyfriend and I shared a 4 meat platter, we had: RIBS, BRISKET, CHICKEN, and PULLED PORK. We went a bit crazy with the sides because we wanted to try everything -- loaded mashed potatoes, hush puppies, mac and cheese, cole slaw, onion rings, and waffle fries.  Everything was so good! My favorite was the pulled pork, it was seasoned really well and so tender. Close second -- the bbq chicken. SUPER JUICY! The brisket was melt in your mouth, a bit over seasoned for me. Ribs were okay, not the best I've had ever, but were good.   All sides taste home made. My favorite were the hush puppies, mac and cheese (SO CREAMY), and loaded mashed potatoes.   I kept seeing people order the Outlaw burger. ONLY SMOKES! It's humungus! Definitely trying that next time I come back!   All in all -- bf and I are super excited to have a bbq joint we love and can bring family/friends to! We will definitely be coming around whenever we are near the strip. Definitely a must try if you are in the area!",

Cornbread is also yummy, not too sweet. Pull prom and chicken are my favorite meats.   I'll be coming back here next year when I'm in town next year.",

There is a line but it moves really fast. The man that took my order was really friendly and fun. I ordered the BBQ Nacho Fries with pulled pork and my boyfriend got the Out Law Burger. My nacho fries were soooo good, omg the best thing I have eaten in a while I highly recommend them, my boyfriends burger was so talk and stacked I don't know how he was able to take a bite out of it. It's cool when they take you your order because they yell out your name and where your from, everyone working there is super friendly the atmosphere is great. I would definitely come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas and would tell anyone going to Vegas to go try it.",

The ribs are good but I don't think they're exceptional.  Even though I can't impress people with the awesome credential of being from Kansas City or Texas, I still recommend Rollin' Smoke if you like great BBQ and sides served in a genuine dive (next to a strip club and almost under an overpass).",

Everything I've ever had here was great, but my go-to is the pulled port sandwich with hush puppies and sweet tea. If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for a side of their Hot Damn (or is it Damn Hot -- I can never remember) sauce, which is a very spicy version of their house made BBQ sauce. It's awesome. My mouth is watering just thinking about Rollin Smoke.   They are soon to be opening a second location in the Pawn Star's new container park, just a few blocks above the north end of The Strip.",

Rollin smoke has it down, ribs were tender and had good flavor, as did the brisket. BBQ sauce is a HUGE deal to me, and theirs was just right, not too spicy, sweet, or acidic. Sides were perfect, I couldn't decide so I had greens, mac n cheese, beans and hush puppies. Everything was excellent, I really did appreciate the atmosphere, the fact that they pretty much just give you your food reminded me of the southern bbq culture. BBQ is not a fancy upscale experience where your given limited napkins, its fun and loose, they definitely have that down. I'll definitely make this a go to spot.",

You'll see plenty of awards and accolades on their walls inside the (decidedly small) dining area, and you'll soon realize why they've earned them. It may be hard to find, but this place is worth the journey.  The most important thing I'd recommend is to go there on an odd day, like a tuesday or wednesday night, because on their busier peak periods the food isn't as fresh, I think they may just make huge batches of the common items and put them under heat lamps. If you go there for lunch you're guaranteed the freshest meats. And wow, are they worth it.  The meats are tender and flavorful, from the ribs that are soft and juicy, to the crisp snap of their spicy sausage. Their sides are to die for, particularly the loaded mashed potatoes and the baked beans. And you absolutely have to save room for dessert, their homemade banana pudding is a gift from the cosmos. It's simply unbelieveable. I'd recommend getting one of their multiple meat platters and sharing it, to get the full spectrum of what's on offer here.",

They had a line but it moved pretty quickly and we were able to snag some seats to enjoy our selections. The Woman that took our order was friendly and patient while we decided what to get. Before we got our food my husband made the comment well we found our bbq place closer to home. I told him how does he know we have not tried the food yet. He laughed at me and said the line is out the door you don't get a line like that with just okay food. A waiter brought out our food he was friendly. Our food was fresh and hot, the hotlinks has this snap when you bite them that your looking for when you bite into one of them. The ribs were perfectly seasoned and fell off the bone, the only complaint were they were a tad bit greasy. The chicken was cooked just right and had a nice smoked taste when you bit into it. The okra was hot and fresh and the chipolte dip was great! The brisket was great I always do a roll test where if i can roll it and it does not break apart it's cooked to my liking, they have hands down one of the best briskets i've had. The mac-n-cheese was the disappointment, it was thick and just didn't taste like mac-n-cheese that you would expect with bbq food. I will be back I see why they have the line they have.",

I had the club wrap, and husband had the pulled piggy sandwich and onion rings. The wrap and sandwich were great, but the onion rings were the best we've had anywhere. (Yes, I snitched some from husband.)  Ordering was easy, and food came in about 7 minutes after that. Staff was friendly.

It wasn't like I only tried one item...our group had ordered a mixture of ribs, brisket, chicken, pulled pork sandwich, wings, corn nuggets, hush puppies and potato salad. Nothing really stood out. I am willing to give it a second try but maybe this time I'll go during the day instead of an hour before closing. Aside from the food, the people and service were great.",

I just now realized they close at 8pm, which was the time we arrived at the spot. Not once did any of the workers mention this to us, they are so friendly and welcoming. I must've took forever to figure out what I wanted to order too - now I feel so bad for being a douchebag customer LOL. I even ordered it to go then we ended up eating there instead....and still, not one mention about their closing time. Thank you guys for allowing us to savor your wonderful product way past closing...kudos forrealz! On top of all this, hubby asked me to order another rib piece to go - and boy did we luck out. They happily took our order and sent us off with two pieces instead of one. WINNIN! Beef ribs = easy 10+ Cheesy mac n cheese = 10 Rib tips = 8 Peach cobbler = 9 Customer Service = 10+  Likelihood to return = you betcha!  If you're a first timer, don't let the location sway you...you will sorrily miss out!",

You won't find the \"dining experience\" here that you would find at those other places which have that certain 'manufactured' feel.  I'm in no ways putting Lucille's or Dave's down because they are still good.  However, Rollin Smoke gives you plenty of delicious food at a very reasonable price.  Oh my gosh, the brisket was so full of flavor.  My friend shared one of his beef ribs with me and I just cannot desribe how heavenly it felt sinking my teeth into it. haha.  My only regret was feeling like crap after a sleepless night and with a hangover ... after all it is Vegas LOL.  I really wanted to come here again on my last Vegas trip but too bad I was sick.    I came here solely based on awesome Yelp reviews.",

Spicey , sweet or vinigar. Bathrooms...place to wash after eating good bbq. 1 small single room. Also it gets busy and tables are hard to come by.   I would definitly get it again.

The yams were drenched in liquid sauce and couldn't mix it in so it ruined it for me. And sorry to say as I was excited for cobbler, but this is far from cobbler! Gosh this is making a trip down south seem overdue!  We called ahead our order and still waited a long time as they just said overwhelmed by orders.

All were excellent. Mac and cheese was my favorite. Everybody else with me said it was equally as amazing. My brother ordered the chop brisket sandwich with coleslaw, and cheese. He said it was amazing so when you order it that way ask for \"the John\". Overall excellent place and a must try in Vegas.",

Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a True love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.",

    "text": "I have been on the look out for outstanding BBQ in Las Vegas, and I finally found It!! I tried this place solely based on the yelp reviews, and you guys did not let me down!!  I went on a Saturday night around 8:30 pm. The parking lot was packed, the outside picnic tables were packed, and there was a line out the door. The line moved quickly & we ordered within 5 or so minutes.  The menu is huge, so it might be worth checking it out ahead of time. I ordered the Outlaw Burger with waffle fries, and my husband got the Duo plate with chicken & brisket. We, also, got a side of corn nuggets & a peach cobbler. With 2 drinks, everything came to $25.  You order at the counter, and seat yourself. Drinks & silverware are self serve. And, when your order is ready, they bring it to your table. While we were waiting, I observed a few people who were obvious regulars. Another good sign.  Every single item we ordered was excellent. The chicken was super moist and flavorful. The brisket had those delicious crispy pieces on the edges. Waffle fries were crispy and well seasoned. The peach cobbler was warm and gooey!! But, the rock star of our meal was definitely the Outlaw Burger. It. Was. Huge. Like 10\" high huge!  When we were wrapping up our leftovers, they didn't have a lid for our cobbler...so they gave us a whole 2nd one to go. It was a little thing, but their service really impressed me.  We left super full, and already planning what we were going to order next time. I, also, like that they are open late since I'm a night owl.  If you like BBQ, you need to check this place out!",

It's located on Highland near the Sahara exit and the 15, close to the Las Vegas Strip. We were greeted by the friendly staff and two of us decided to try the all you can eat option which basically gave us the opportunity to eat anything and everything from the menu for $34.99. Starting with 3 meats and two sides and then two meats and one side on all subsequent orders. If you want good BBQ at reasonable prices, and friendly service I highly recommend you try this place. It's not fancy and you may have a decent wait in line to order but the food is delicious. The burnt ends, baby back ribs, pulled pork, rib tips and brisket were our favorites. The chicken, hot links and fried shrimp also received high marks. As far as the side orders, we all loved the corn nuggets and Mac and cheese, however everything was awesome! The desserts included banana pudding, blueberry cobbler and root beer floats! Our sincere compliments to the entire crew of Chef Damon, Chef Christian, Moises, Brenda, Lizelle and James Monticello who went above and beyond to make our experience so awesome! Keep up the great work Rolling Smoke BBQ! We will be back and wholeheartedly recommend this hidden gem!",

It's a giant all beef hot dog topped with brisket, onion straws, and nacho cheese. This thing didn't mess around. It was big, messy, and delicious! It was a little bit spicy but not overpowering. My wife had the baked potato and she loved it. My son had the sliders and they were bigger than expected and he loved them too. My wife recommends the corn nuggets. I had one and they were great!

The Beef Ribs were like freakin' brontosaurus bones. Huge ribs, tons of meat, perfect bark, excellent charred rub, and juicy as all get out. Perfect combo of meat and fat, and a sure gut buster considering the slab consists of only four ribs. One order of chicken wings was similar to that of about two full chickens. Served as five pieces, but each is dished up as a whole wing and drum. Judging by the size, the chickens are prehistoric, much like those rearing the beef ribs (freaking monsters). The Rib Tips were fine...great sauce, rub, perfectly smoked and charred. Served as 8 pieces, it was a filler-upper like everything else. GO THERE HUNGRY! You'll absolutely be impressed with what's coming out of Rollin's smoker!",

The owner came out and welcomed us and insisted on giving us a free dessert (banana cream pie!!!). We also got a tour of the kitchen/smokers.

Like a typical Yelper I checked out the reviews immediately after seeing his post. I was impressed that they have so many reviews and 4 1/2 stars average rating, you really can't beat that. To be quite honest and I hate to put it this way but Rollin' Smoke is meritocracy at it's finest. My friend and I shared the pit special with brisket, pulled pork, chicken and ribs with sides of fried onions, mac n cheese and corn bread. We also ordered banana pudding for desert. I hate to say it, but my favorite part of the meal was the fried onions.. Yah, sad I know? The ribs were pretty tasty, but everything else was kind of blah. I can't really go into detail, maybe because it wasn't that good to me or memorable. Maybe it was a bit too authentic for my liking or the possibility they BBQ theirs Arkansas style. I'm only guessing the owners of this BBQ joint are from Arkansas considering they have University of Arkansas memorabilia around the place.  I tried a BBQ place out last week and I would definitely choose them over Rollin' Smoke. I was not a fan of the sauce either, to the point I scraped it off ribs. The prices here are pretty reasonable, so I can't complain about that. The inside of the restaurant is really rough around the edges, but maybe that's the vibe they are going for? To add to that, the restaurant is the oddest place one could think of. Pretty sketchy in some ways, but that doesn't turn customers away considering there was a good amount of people eating there on a Tuesday night. I was really expecting a lot from this place, but I should of ordered the cat fish like I originally planned?",

The sauce is great, I usually get the pulled pork or the trio plate and I must say is very tasteful.  The potato salad and macaroni and cheese is too die for.  Very well blended and hits the right spots on the tongue.  Oh and you have to try the beans!!! The best beans I have tasted. The downside since there from Arkansas, they should know about Sweet Tea....which, when they first opened, there tea was very good but then they contracted with Coke and they supplied them with there version of Sweet Tea, which in my opinion they need to stick to Cola.  So all in all, skip McDonald's take the drive and head over to Highland drive and get your tongue ready for the best barbecue in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wanted to try a bbq while in Vegas. I used to go to Ellis Island but this place is soo much better and probably a better deal. We got there no problem with the GPS. I was worried that the place would be crowded since I was dinner time but we just beat the rush.  The plan was to order the \"pit special\" 4 meats and 3 sides. We got burnt ends, pulled pork, quarter chicken, spare ribs, one beef rib, corn nuggets, loaded smashed potato and bacon potato salad. Everything came out in about 3 minutes which was great since I was starving. The burnt ends were delicious the pulled pork a little dry, the chicken breast was moist since most times chicken breast is dry. I tried the spare ribs and my was I surprised they were the best tasting spare rib I ever had. Great smoke and tender. Not hanging off the bone but still on and but so tender and flavorful and it came off the bone with a bite. The beef rib for me was no disappointment either. Big moist and the same as the pork ribs. They were a little fat but that's the way I like them. Probably too fat for some but that is where the flavor is. Corn nuggets were good and the other sides were average. I would definitely be back next time in town.",

    "text": "Tonight was a good night for new culinary experiences. After watching the new Maleficent movie and having a few glasses of wine, we decided to make our way to Rollin Smoke. I have heard nothing but great things about this place. After checking Yelp, I noticed their 4.5 star overall rating with about 500 reviews. OH-EM-GEE, how have NOT been to this place yet?!?!  It's not surprise, this place is in the middle of an industrial area, right under the freeway and next to all the strip clubs. Sketchy as heck, but holy smoker in their parking lot! The aroma of smoked meats filled the air. I didn't care what the outside looked like, I was more interested in what they had to offer! The inside of the joint is a down home BBQ joint! Different reds and yellows adorn the wall, different rooms to accommodate different types of parties. They have a few rooms and even outside space. There were metal table tops, wooden benches, TVs in each room and a mirage on the back wall of the room we chose to dine in.On every table there was a bottle of their homemade BBQ sauce. It was more of a vinegar base, a little too tangy but that's just my own taste. The staff was super efficient. The guy who took my order, I think was one of the owners. He was super personable and really seemed to care about how things were going, how I liked my food and really thanked me for coming in. For my meal, I wanted to try a few things. Here's what I got:  Half slab of beef ribs, 2 bones, for $15.99. This Smokin Plate came with a side, I chose collard greens, corned bread or roll and a drink. The beef ribs were the best beef ribs I've ever had! It literally just fell off the bone, no joke. The rub they used brought so much flavor to the rib! Every bite was juicy, flavorful and packed with smokey goodness. The collard greens were cooked with brisket, had a little spice and vinegar and so good!  Pulled piggy sandwich for $7.99. **There's a Yelp special when you check in** Every sandwich purchase comes with a free dessert. I chose the peach cobbler (usually for $3.99). The pulled pork sandwich was made with chopped pork, not finely shredded. I loved that because the meat had some depth to it. It was served on a hot dog bun which was different but seemed to work! The corn bread side was buttery and moist, probably the best corn bread I've ever had! I made a comment that my grandma's corn bread was unbelievable but this one gave my grandma's bread a run for it's money (Sorry grandma!).  As my free dessert, the peach cobbler was gooey and filled with chunks of peaches.   I must say, this is THE BEST BBQ joint in Las Vegas, hands down. I've had a few BBQ joints here before but nothing compares to Rollin Smoke. This place really does a great job at serving great food. When I'm here, it's just good ole country fun. Looking around the dining area, every party seemed to have a huge smile on their face. I've been to lots of places down south, from Nashville, to Louisville, to Charlotte. BBQ joints different where every go but when you're in Las Vegas, you REALLY need to get your butts down here. You will NOT be disappointed!",

The gentleman taking the orders was helpful to is first timers, funny and knowledgable!  The food comes out quick so if you are in a hurry you won't wait long.  I truly enjoyed everything we ordered - pulled pork, spare ribs, chicken, brisket, cheezy Mac and cheese, kicking beans and waffle fries. In saying that I do need to reiterate how delicious the waffle fries were. Normally when I think waffle fry I think slightly soggy. These were far far far from that in fact they were so crispy that I think you could cut paper with them.",

Plain and simple, the brisket and pulled pork were delicious.  They come pretty sauce-less.  Don't fuck it up by throwing 2 gallons of BBQ sauce on them, kids.  I mean, the sauce is legit, but the flavor of the smoke in the meat is amazing.  The jalapeno slaw wasn't super jalapeno-y, which is good.  You could tell there was a kick, but it didn't overpower it.  The greens would have made Popeye's eyeballs explode.  Mine were boss-level.  I do dig greens, though, so I might be biased...  All in all, 6 meals for my coworkers for $77, plus tip, was definitely worth it.",

Ribs and chicken were good, great smoke flavor on both but 30 minutes later you still have a smokey taste in your mouth (usually indicates usage of liquid smoke). Hot link was mediocre. Mac and cheese lacked seasoning and needed more cheese in the sauce, slaw was good and the beans were also nice. Overall it was a disappointment.

    "text": "Some of the best low-and-slow smoked BBQ we've had anywhere. This is the real deal. Rollin Smoke is so good at smoking their meat that they slice their brisket on the thick side, but the slices are still perfectly tender. It takes some serious smoking talent to be able to pull that off.   We tried their smoked meatloaf (with brisket in the meatloaf mix), spare ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. All were fantastic. Sides we tried were greens and mac-and-cheese, and it was clear they take pride in their sides as well.   This is a small place in a small strip-mall off the Vegas strip just east of the I-15 freeway. If you blink while driving by you might miss it. You order at a podium then go find a seat and they bring your food out to you. We were there at 4:30 PM on a Tuesday and there was no wait and ample seating available, but it's easy to see how Rollin Smoke might get very crowded and seating might be hard to come by during peak times. Parking might be challenging during peak times as well.   The prices they charge for their food represent an exceptional value in a tourist town like Las Vegas. For the price of a fancy appetizer on the strip you can have a 3-meat platter with a side and a drink. What a find!",

All good cuts of meat, flavor, sauce, etc.  I had the corn fritters and potato salad as sides and both were perfect.  Their prices are very fair for what you get.  The service was top notch with about 3 people asking me if everything was good.  Unless you are maybe an ultra bbq snob, you will love this place if you love bbq.  This is a place I will definitely remember when I am in town again.  The only downside is that it is in the industrial area of town, and even that really doesn't matter.  The food does.  6 stars.",

    "text": "My quest for excellent non-chain restaurants continues, and finding this one was a happy accident.  There are large smokers in the parking lot which is originally what drew our attention to the place.  Usually we find our gems from Yelp, but this time it was a drive-by (or I should say that I find places on Yelp as the bf is in the food industry and like many industry people has a baseless grudge against Yelp).    Since i am not a huge meat eater what I really care about are the sides.  The sides were amazing.  Which is great because a lot of times at BBQ places the focus is on the meat only and the sides are kind of an after thought.  The peach cobbler was insanely good.  And I have been dreaming about the loaded mashed potatoes since I had them.  I also had the mac n cheese.  The waiter (who I assume is also one of the owners since he thanked us about 20 times for coming in) recommended the mac n cheese.  Listen if you can't execute a delicious mac n cheese you should throw yourself off a bridge.  It's macaroni, cheese, cream and bake.  It was really good but I was more impressed with the other sides that are nonstandard and were amazing.  On my next visit I plan on trying the banana pudding.      It does have its advantages and disadvantages, depending on who you are.  It is right down the street from the Rhino - a disadvantage to me, but an advantage to any dirt-bags.  The parking lot is kind of sketchy, again a disadvantage to me, but like home to dirt-bags.  The BBQ sauce is really peppery.  I personally like milder sauces and I am not a big meat eater, but I could still appreciate the execution of the sauce and that it was made in house.  I am not used to eating smoked meat so was a little concerned that the chicken looked pink, but the bf explained to me that that is how smoked meat should look that has actually been smoked in a smoker and not just marinated in smoke \"flavor\".  All the meat was very tender, but the sauce was a little too intense for me.  That being said I was more than happy to stick with the sides.",

Simple, reasonable and downright southern style bbq, all was awesome. Staff was super friendly and educated us newbies. Had the sampler of pork, hot link and brisket.... mmmm mmmm good. The jalapeno chipolte laced slaw as well as the hot link sausage were great and packed some substantial heat. Hubby has the rib sampler plate and couldn't finish it was so loaded.

Baked beans are \"meh\" and the coleslaw is pretty spicy. This is the only place in Vegas that makes sweet tea the way it should be, extra syrupy and sweet. The pulled pork is on point but last night it was served cold. I guess maybe that's just the way they have it, I don't know, but still very delicious. Now the only reason I deducted a star is because I absolutely LOVE ribs, last time I came I got the St. Louis spare ribs which were dry and disappointing, and this time I got the \"world famous\" beef ribs which were also dry but very fatty and just not good. Not only that it was $18.99 for a half slab which is only 2 pieces, kinda pricey IMO. But they do give locals discounts which makes up for it. Next time I go I'm going to try to baby backs, but if those don't impress then I'm going to be really sad because everyone says amazing things about the ribs!",

If I want BBQ I typically pick it up when I am on business in Texas and South Carolina.   Well let me be the first to say...I WAS WRONG! This place is the real deal!   The BURNT ENDS! That is all I have to say...  All the food is delicious, but certain things on the menu are MIND-BLOWING! (Burnt ends, beef ribs, pulled pork)",

We chose the brisket, pork, and pork ribs. It came smothered in their BBQ sauce, which is slightly tangy and spicy. The pork ribs is the best out of the three...moist and tender; the meat literally falls off the bone. The brisket was a bit dry and the pulled pork was ok, just cover them in BBQ sauce and it'll be fine.   As for the sides, the mac and cheese was super cheesy, and the coleslaw has a spicy kick to it. The coleslaw helps give a taste variety to the richness of the meats. Definitely worth coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The area is near the freeway underpass with a few homeless people that were probably previous high rollers.  I know because I lost $80 and felt like I on the cusp of feeling homeless myself.  We walked in and noticed we were the only Asians.  This is unusual since we've never felt like this living in San Ho.  If something were to go down I know their Ghetto Fu is no match for my martial art skills.  Besides, all these guys probably has clogged arteries anyways so I proceeded to order some food to share with my girl.    We ordered the brisket and beef ribs with a side of their potato salad.  The brisket was quite dry and my clothes had more of smoke ring from the casino than the meat.  The beef rib, although quite large and meaty was also quite fatty and only slightly better.  I just doused it in their BBQ sauce and called it good.  Surprisingly the best part of the meal was actually their potato salad.  It was creamy and topped with plenty of crispy bacon bits.  Not quite representative of the Yelp 4.5 star experience that I expected.  It's about as good as BBQ from a cafeteria.",

The fiance and I love good BBQ places and saw that Rollin Smoke Barbeque has beef ribs, not that common where we're from so we knew we had to splurge and substitute for them! We opted for the trio choice of 3 meats: beef ribs, spare ribs & brisket (sliced instead of chopped). This was $17.99 + $6 sub for the beef ribs & it came with cornbread and a side - we chose the bacon potato salad.   Our food came out super quick and was a big portion, definitely enough for 2 people. The bacon potato salad was so good! The beef rib (only one rib) was disappointing because it was immensely fatty and the brisket (~5 pcs) was even worse because it was sooooo dry. Brisket is supposed to be tender with an amazing smoke ring but theirs failed at both. The spare ribs (2 pcs) were good but didn't fall off the bone. I liked the bbq sauce, not super thick like some places. Corn bread was meh, if you like light and cake-like then this is for you. I like mine super crispy at the top.   The location was kinda sketchy and in the middle of no where it felt like. There are some communal tables out front and two small rooms inside with a handful of tables. I feel like this was just average for me. Phil's BBQ is still my favorite on the west coast!",

They explained their favorites, which are popular with customers, what's unique and which combos would give us a real introduction to the restaurant.  The decor is clean and simple, but Rollin is about the Que, and they bring it! We visited before the lunch rush on a Saturday and the other customers were all locals. There were several catering orders getting ready to go and the quality of the food looked and smelled great! Each order was meticulously double-checked before being loaded up for delivery-a sign of how the business is run!  Our food was served quickly, at the correct temperature. There are several styles of bbq sauce if you prefer vinegary or tomato based, spicy or sweet. The corn nuggets are crunchy and creamy, unique and delicious! The brisket was smoky and unctuous. The chicken moist and the pork had a rich crust from the smoker and was still moist. The meal was huge and fairly priced.  We will be back every time we're in Vegas and if Rollin' Smoke decides to open a restaurant at the beach, I'll be the first in line!",

    "text": "I visited this place last week, and overall it's amazing. I found about this place from a Stricly Dumpling (Mikey Chen) video on the all you can eat BBQ for $36. That price includes every single thing on the menu. No joke, you can get a burger to burnt ends. The burger and meat loaf is well known, but I stuck to the basics on my trip. That said, during his video the food look amazing, so I had to check it out when I was in town.  For starters, I didn't do the all you can eat, but got the 5 meat platter. I got  2 Ribs, brisket, pork, sausage, and burnt ends in place of the Chicken. It came with three sides including mac and cheese, green beans, and corn nuggets. Before I go into the meats, the sides are amazing. The mac and cheese is rich. The corn nuggets are deep fried to a nice crunch, and are sweet. And the green beans are stir fried in garlic and a little oil. My dad got the baked beans, and they are also good. Overall the sides are amazing.   The meats themselves, overall top notch. Personally the weakest link for me was the burnt ends, but I have had some of the best in KC that had a more smokey flavor that I haven't found anywhere else, so it's my bias opinion. They are still very good, but not the best on the plate for me. The best by far was the brisket and ribs. The rub they use for the brisket really stands out, and the flavor from how long they cook it was amazing. The ribs itself were really good with it's own rub, and they were very tender and flavorful. Right after that the pork and sausage stood out well. The sausage had a nice snap, and it had a good spice and kick to it. Nothing too spicy, but noticeable, and the smoke flavor stood out here. Finally, the pork was good. It was a tad dry for my taste, but roasted pork is very hard, and considering how it was likely 2 pounds of meats, possibly more, with 3 sides for less than 30 bucks, then I can't complained at all.  Overall this is easily a solid BBQ place that can hold up in BBQ cities like KC, or St. Louis. I'm originally from MO and have visited both, and I won't consider myself a BBQ expert, but I've had my fair share of well known BBQ places. This place can hold it's own easily, and the price point is one of the best I've ever seen. If you are in Vegas, or a new local who hasn't been here yet, check it out.",

I don't come here often as it's not that close to where I live, but always enjoy myself and the food whenever I am in the area and am able to stop in and get me something delicious to eat.   I usually will get the Outlaw burger. It is a hamburger mixed with brisket, onions, bell pepper, topped with onion strings, red cabbage slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and a chipotle aioli. This monster of a burger costs $13.99 and worth every penny.  I usually make this a combo for an extra $4.   Other great items on their menu are their Club Wrap, BBQ wrap (I didn't see this on their menu anymore, but was told they'll still make it for you), ribs, chopped brisket sandwich, The Spudtastic, bacon potato salad, fried okra, loaded mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and more. There is definitely something for everyone   They have lots of seating from in the main area when you first enter to another whole room and benches outside. This place gets busy and crowded, so if you aren't there at opening, you may need to take your food to go.   Employees are all very friendly.",

    "text": "Frustrating! Frustrating! Frustrating!  We're here in Vegas again and wanted Rollin Smoke BBQ since it's now on our Must Have list. We placed a Yelp Delivery Order which included some of the fantastic sides we had before. Unfortunately, the order was delivered without one of the sides. I contacted the restaurant directly hoping the side can be delivered on the driver's next outing but they directed me to contact Yelp Fulfilled by Grubhub directly. After calling them, they contacted the driver who didn't have it and said their only remedy is to refund us for the missing item. Quite disappointing since we were really looking forward to another wonderful Rollin Smoke experience. Food was alright. Delivery was not. I assume this is the fault of the restaurant since it wasn't included in the delivery. So beware. If you want to make sure your order is correct, visit the restaurant in-person.",

And it didnt disappoint.  Saw pictures of the beef ribs from an earlier review so thats what i wanted.   Just as big and juicy as the other reviews.   Full slab for $35.  Was too full to try the sides.    Lots of choices for drinks.   I left feeling like i should have smuggled some on tge plane ride home.   Definitrly will stop again on my next trip.",

You can also sit on the picnic tables outside if the weather is nice and doesn't feel like the surface of the sun. I have been 4 times now and the employees have always been great.

It's the best BBQ in town and it's not even close. My favorite is the Brisket Dog, but I'll happily get pulled pork or hot links if I'm in the mood. I don't like corn bread, but I could eat RSB corn bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's like corn bread and pound cake hooked up and we get to eat their offspring.  I was really glad to see a change in the layout of the restaurant. It used to be really tough to navigate the small space when it got busy, but now it's much better. I like going when its quiet so I can snag a seat by the TV, otherwise I'll sit in the extra space by the fish tank.  Only negative is that they didn't address the bathrooms when they did the remodel. They are clean, but pretty old and small.",

Everyone's food came out pretty fast but unfortunately they forgot to put in my order so my food came out last. Because of that, the manager (or I think it was the manager) brought me our a complimentary dessert which was awesome. As for the actual BBQ, it was pretty darn good! Can't beat it for the price too. I've had BBQ in Houston so it's not the same but as good as you can get for outside of Texas and especially in Vegas!",

An unsung hero that deserves praise is the cornbread...moist and slightly sweet, it was the best I've ever had. This will be on our \"must eat\" list every time we're in Vegas. 5 stars isn't enough! Thanks Rolling Smoke for making such great food! :)",

I have been back every week sense that first visit and have tried many different menu items. Each one has been great. If you like food, you have to eat here.

This location isn't near the strip but it was still relatively crowded the day we went.  The food looked great but was very underwhelming once we started eating.  The ribs were not fall off the bone and the beans were not what I expected.  The most disappointing part of the meal was the long black strand of HAIR that I pulled out of the macaroni and cheese. I literally had only had one bite of everything before discovering the hair. Needless to say I informed the workers and was offered another order of macaroni and cheese, I declined.  There's no way I would ever be able to eat here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.",

We were just in Vegas for a mini vacay to celebrate the New Year and could not leave without having some of the BEST damn BBQ I've ever had. I gotta give(oh gosh I hope this her name) Crystal a HUGE shout out; she was the absolute friendliest person ever. The entire staff is on their game. Place is always nice and clean. We always order brisket, ribs and hot links. The meat is always so full of flavor and very tender. Do NOT get me started on the Mac n Cheese. I was tempted to bring some back to LA, but was worried it wouldn't taste as good. If you're ever in Vegas and find yourself craving some BBQ; you will not be disappointed!! Side note: we did purchase and bring back some of their dry rub. We can't wait to use it at our next smoker session.",

Portions are very plentiful and prices are right. This is real quality food the beef ribs are the star of the show for me which was a hard choice because all the meat was amazing! I love the fact they don't overly sauce the meat which always tells me they are confident on the cook and taste of their meat as they should be. The only improvement was on the sides wasn't not a fan of the collard greens they added brisket to it but it tasted canned, the mac and cheese was not horrible but nothing to talk about. The peach cobbler could use work as well but overall they are pros at what they are in business for smoked meats!!",

I had the banana pudding which I must say has improved since the last time I visited here. Actually I'm just going to be honest I had the all you can eat and boy oh boy collard greens after eating that meat is the way to go. After you eat all your Meats all your proteins make sure you get some beans and collard greens and by the next morning you'll have an empty stomach because you would have going to the bathroom so much you'll be ready to try it again.

If you are coming here for your first time, I recommend getting the Duo or Trio Choice of 2/3 meats (depending how hungry you are). By doing this, you are able to sample 2 or 3 of their meats while choosing a side. Their mac and cheese is good and gooey with cheese, but my personal favorite and go-to is their mashed potatoes, which is topped with cheese and a heaping amount of bacon bits. As for their meats, you really need to try their spare ribs and brisket. They are both super tender; cutting into the brisket is like cutting into butter. And for the ribs, the meat just falls of so easily.   Definitely will be coming back for their food. And another plus, their staff is so very friendly. I came here twice in one week and they recognized me the second time and saw I had brought someone new to the restaurant, so they gave us free drinks for spreading the word. Really great place.",

    "text": "Really Awesome Barbecue!!!! I have been in search for the best barbecue from Austin, to Kansas, to South Carolina, etc....  only to find The Best barbecue right here in Las Vegas!!!  My favorites are their sliced brisket, brisket tips, sweet mama's sauce, and the macaroni salad served hot!!  Also love their corn bread.  If you love barbecue, this is the place for it!!!!  Very casual place with no frills.  Just bring your big appetite!   If dining in, eat at their newly added wing on the left side of the building.  The A/C is cool and the place is very clean and brand new.  You still need to place your order in the main section of the restaurant.  They bring the food to you.  I'm so happy to find this place!  You will too!!",

It was the old location we went to and loved so much we decided to go again the next day but to the new location which is the reason for the 3 stars.  I give 8 stars to the old location but we were very disappointed in the new location due to the double higher prices and the food itself wasn't the same.  Will only go to the original location and stay away from the new one unless they can make it as great.",

    "text": "Rollin Smoke is located off the strip away from all the lights and glamour. This makes it easy to get to by car, more difficult to get to by foot. Even though it is located nearly under an overpass and directly adjacent to a strip club it felt strangely southern and comfortable. The people were excellent. Fun and friendly. The decor felt completely original. It enhanced the experience and wasn't distracting. There were a few picnic tables out front which I have come to love about authentic barbecue joints.  Brisket (upgraded to burnt ends), ribs, and coleslaw with a drink and a piece of bread for $22 felt steep for the amount of food we got, yet by the end I was thoroughly stuffed and for that reason, I actually feel like this is a good deal. I believe the quality of the meat and technique were excellent, which deserves a higher price point. Did I mention that it was delicious? It was delicious. The brisket was crispy on the outside with the soft, delicate, juicy interior that I have come to love. The ribs fell right off the bone. They had authentic Carolina vinegar which cut through the fatty brisket. Their mustard base sauce had excellent tang and was good, but I bet it would go better on smoked chicken. Their sweet sauce really shined though. It is tomato based (instead of molasses) and it was just sweet enough. Really complemented the smokiness of the meat.",

Ok, its not in the best area of town and doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you walk in and smell that wonderful smoke and BBQ flavor you know your gonna love it! We of course had to try the Outlaw burger made with brisket and fried onion strings as well as the brisket and rib combo plate with corn fritters. The burger was HUGE and the brisket was so tender and delicious. One of the best burgers ever. The brisket and rib plate was also great. The ribs were probably some of the best I've ever had. They were so smoky and tender and the corn fritters were golden bites of goodness.   Our friends ordered the BBQ nachos which were waffle fries loaded with BBQ pork, cheese, beans and sour cream. So good.   I will definitely be back to try the hot links and baby backs. Thanks for a great meal!",

The meat is very tender and full of flavor. Their homemade BBQ sauce is possibly laced with crack! It's very addictive. Tender ribs, flavorful pork and brisket, a must try if you want True smoked BBQ.  The smokers outside are worth the experience checking out. There aren't places like this in town that give you the True home cooked feel. This is one of them.",

We are from Cincinnati in Las Vegas on vacation, Jessica took great care of us. The food here is just incredible, we got a great deal with the pit special, 4 meats , 3 sides & 1 drink for only $19.99. We had double hot links, chicken all-white meat & burnt ends. We also added cornbread which tastes like cake, Yum. The people in Vegas are spoiled to have such an incredible Bar-B-Q place. If you're visiting Las Vegas and don't stop by to eat you missed the best food place in Vegas. We cheated and tried another Bar-B-Q place yesterday called John Mull's Road Kill Grill after seeing it on TV, but after eating their food we realized we wasted our gas, time & money as Rollin Smoke is closer and has way better Bar-B-Q. John Mull's Road Kill Grill not only was not close in quality it wasn't even in the same ballpark. Keep up making such great food and we will never stray again, as Rollin Smoke is \"DAM  GOOD\"!!!!",

I have to say, I wasn't that thrilled and it may be because of what we order, which was 2 sandwiches - 1 beef brisket and 1 smoked chicken. The beef brisket was very greasy and lacked seasoning this came with waffle fries which were okay- nothing special. The chicken was nice, well seasoned but they were a bit skimpy on the portion and I got a side salad with mine that came with a vinaigrette that was very spicy and certainly not a traditional salad vinaigrette. Overall, good service and decent food but nothing wild.",

The ribs were very pink and she was afraid to eat it.  The brisket had black charcoal all over it and again refused to eat it.  Her boyfriend decided to eat the ribs.  The next day he was sick and we are guessing it might have been the food.  The seating leaves something to be desired.  I can handle not so fancy seating for some good barbeque.  We sat at picnic tables and unfortunately my back was to where people line up to order.  Several times I got hit in the back by people's arms, purses etc.  People breathing down your back and gawking at what you are eating.  Go to Dave's Barbeque for a better meal.  The bread pudding was good though.",

We were in the area so we stopped in after hearing nothing but good things. Lucky us, we scored a parking spot right up front. When we left, people were parking down the street. Well, I know why!!  My sister and I split the four meat combo. We got brisket, chicken, ribs and pulled pork. My favorite was the pulled pork, but all the meat was excellent! For our sides, we had corn nibblers, hush puppies and jalapeno cole slaw.  Sadly, we eat low carb, so we just had a little bit of each side. I was very very sad that I couldn't inhale all of them. The fact that I left three hush puppies behind literally makes me want to cry! Either way, we were finishing up and one of the guys from the back walked up and asked if the cole slaw wasn't good. You could tell he was concerned and wanted to make sure everything was okay. I explained that I am low carb and low sugar and that I WISH I could eat it all. I explained how good it all was and he gave us a high five. Nicest guy!  So not only is the food great, but the customer service was equally as good. You can tell they care about every aspect of their business, from the quality of the food to the people they serve.  As a fellow small business owner, and one in the food industry, it can get VERY hard to just run an establishment, let alone do it in a way that makes people obsessed with your food. Somehow, they make this place work pretty seamlessly and we will most CERTAINLY be back soon. My dad is going to lose his mind once we bring him here!",

My wife (who was NOT thrilled when she heard we were getting BBQ instead of the salad/juice bar place she suggested) was beyond stoked with her meal, and I was hoping for a good selection of sides since I was the lone vegetarian entering hostile territory.   The in-laws ordered a brisket sandwich, ribs and a handful of sides. My wife had the BBQ salad with white chicken, and my veggie ass had the mac n cheese, side salad, green beans, and waffle fries. We were all SO STOKED with our food that we kept bringing up how good our lunch was throughout the day.   The place was clean, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the food (and wide array of sauces) really hit the spot. Don't let the neighborhood dissuade you, GO HERE, FOOL!",

I took around 5 minutes to order, as the menu is so big, and the person at the register was very patient and polite.  After you order, they ask your name, and you sit down at a table.  The inside is decorated like you'd expect a bbq joint in Alabama would be. There's also outside seating.   I got the All You Can Eat option, because as a foodie I wanted to try EVERYTHING.  Their food is extraordinary. The tri tip squares were my favorite, but the meatloaf was a close second. The catfish was amongst the best I've ever had. The shrimp is very high quality. I also had the beef ribs, hush puppies, corn bread, mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese and fried onions. It was all good to great! The weakest item is probably the corn bread, but the rest is so good I didn't mind.   Overall, if you want a friendly staff and the best bbq in Vegas, this is your place!",

Food is always good...no doubt about it. However this has been the second time that I placed an order to go and they missed a few items. I know this was my fault for not checking and having it happened the first time I should have learned. But I drove all the way back to North Las Vegas and come to find out the my did not include the corn nuggets (which are good). I called the store but was unable to reach them as the number requests that you dial an extension. I did call the other store on Flamingo and spoke with Denise and she was apologetic and insisted that we come to her location as she would make up for it and provide us with the corn nuggets. It's unfortunate that I have to consider going to that location again.",

We ordered a brisket sandwich and requested the brisket to not be chopped.  It was wonderful.  Tender, jucy , flavorful.  Just fabulous.  We also ordered a slab of St. Louis style ribs.  Again no sauce needed.  Great smoke ring, tender and delicious.  This is my new BBQ Mecca!!  Go.  Now!",

The highlight was definitely the beef rib - juicy and meaty. Round #2 - smoked meatloaf and another baby back rib (no sides). My husband did three rounds - with the shrimp and hot links being his faves. This place is definitely worth getting off the strip for. You won't be sorry.",

I ordered the all you can eat deal for $25 and tried the pulled pork, brisket, sausage and ribs. For my sides, I had the beans, jalapeno coleslaw and collareds. However, the server had two faux pas by forgetting to bring out the greens and they gaved me St. Louis Ribs instead of baby back ribs so Lee went int he back and brought me out the baby back ribs and a beef rib and it was quite meaty. The ice tea was so so and the sweet tea did not have much sweetness either but guess it's better for my teeth! They had some football on the flat screen TV which is a must in September and the joint is nothing fancy but the bbq is definitely worth the trip and I was starving since I just arrived from the East Coast on an empty palate. I'll definitely make a return trip to this joint when I return in January and love the smoke smell whe you enter the restaurant. This place definitely puts Memphis BBQ to shame!",

    "text": "I tried a lunch combo, pulled pork and brisket with mac n cheese and potato salad. I also wanted a sweet tea, which was never made in time for my visit. I was not impressed. The pulled pork was not at all pulled, it was chopped. Not a single piece had any fat, bark or irregular shredded shapes. it was boring dry sliced/chopped meat. The brisket was sliced very thin, cold, tough and had minimal smoke ring, bark etc. The sauce on both was too sweet for my taste. The sides were mediocre. The mac n cheese a bit too watery, tasting more of black pepper than cheese and the potato salad dry and bland. It all came with a dry toasted little dinner roll. Service was minimal, the guy at the podium seemed annoyed to take my order. Order and pay in advance at the podium and the food brought to your table. No one asked me how anything was after the food was brought. They have annoying tiny flimsy horrible plastic cutlery. I would avoid returning just to never have to use those awful plastic forks again. I may try the ribs  someday but am in no rush and certainly wont go out of my way for it.",

I was with my girlfriend and her mother and they had been here before but we still needed a little help with the menu about what to order to which Brenda the lovely lady at the front was more than happy to give us a hand. They had mentioned that they had been here before and who had helped them the last time they had come here which to our surprise happend to be one of their chefs, chef Tim. Even more surprising was the fact that he took the time to come out and acknowledge us he even said he remembered my girlfriend and her mother last time. I can say that this place has some of the best customer service that I have ever experienced. Everything was smiles and great food from beginning to end. The food was absolutely superb and I can honestly say this is my new favorite place to get BBQ. I would even go as far as saying this is the best BBQ place in las Vegas everything was amazing and definitely will be back. 5/5",

As a previous reviewer stated the pork ribs were a little dry. great beans, warning to light hearted these are spicy with a touch of jalapena, beef rib is moist tender and meaty. Ribs have just the right amount of mesq/hick smoke. Rib portions are proper, can stand alone w/o sauce, and well priced (avg $2.00 per bone). Not a fan of the potato salad to much mayo, not enough sugar and mustard. Bacon added to the potato salad is alright. If the ribs were taken off the grill 10mins earlier and just a little extra rub added before and after cooking, I would rate 5 stars LV and everwhere else. This place is a gem, lets see what happens.",

Not only did I not eat the two meats on my plate, I ordered a full rack.  I had the pleasure of meeting the \"smoke master\" and his quote, description of the beef ribs was perfect.  Just as tender as a filet.    The corn nuggets were excellent. Sweet tea was not too sweet.  I chatted with a couple who ordered the famous burger and the meatloaf.  The guy couldn't pick his favorite out of the two.  But the lady said the burger was a clear winner.  All I can say about the burger was this is the first time the real food looked better than the pictures.  The interior is not very large but large enough.  Service was excellent.     Excellent job!",

    "text": "Everyone at work had been raving about this place so I had to take the family there today to check it out. Being from the south we hold a very high standard on BBQ. The joint was a lot smaller than I expected and their webpage mentioned they were kid friendly. I disagree with this--there was only one high chair to be found in the whole place so if you need it hope you're the only person there with a small child. Plus they only have one size drink--I really didn't want to have to buy a big drink for my child to drink two sips of something. All the kids menu items were 10$ which I thought was very pricey for a kids meal. So all in all I vote this place not kid friendly. I wanted to give as much a try as I could so I ordered the 5 meat meal that came with 3 sides; my wife and I shared and had plenty left to bring home. The brisket was fatty and overly peppery. The ribs were pretty good but small in size. The pulled pork I would say was just right along with the sausage. I thought the chicken was a bit dry but flavored up nice when dragged through some sauce. As far as the sides go the mac and cheese was--well mac and cheese; nothing over the top but good nonetheless. The greens had a taste of ash, almost like cigarette ash in them. I definitely never have to have them again. But the corn nuggets, oh yeah they were good, real good.  All in all the food was decent but I don't have to go back there.",

The ribs are great,  the chicken was a little undercooked today but great flavor my friend said.  I got the catfish as the guy there told me it was the best in town,  and that it was,  big claim but he came through and delivered.  Light,  flaky,  crispy with a ton of flavor,  served with hush puppies,  I got the greens as a side and it came with cornbread and a drink for $10.99. You can't beat that!!!  It is on my foodie list and highly deserved!!",

And I look across of me and I see a guy that ordered his food after me, and he got the same exact burger before they got my order.  So I ask the waiter why he got the burger before me when I ordered before him, and he just simply said that yours is coming up, playing it off knowing that he messed up.  So after 10 mins later they bring my food, but I only  got my fries no burger. Waiter said its coming right out.  After another 10 mins I finally get it. Was kind of hard to enjoy my food. But nevertheless fries were good and the burger was just as good. And the price for all the food was just. I would of given 4 stars if they didn't mess up my order and not try to play it off that it wasn't the waiters fault. Don't get me wrong I would definitely come back again and hopefully get better service.",

The smoke ring on the brisket looks like perfection and tastes like a gift from above. Sampled sides were a delicious mac & cheese (with two home made pickles hiding under the styrofoam bowl) and these fried creamed corn poppers that cannot be properly described in text - they are a delightful experience. The home-made house sauce is bold and flavorful and more than enough for most meals, but there are two more home-made sauces as well - a sweet sauce that compliments the pork very well, and a \"damn hot\" sauce that is very tasty and has a sneaky heat that gets you after the second mouthful. Great meats, excellent sides, great sauces and a friendly staff make this place a must-visit on your next trip to Sin City.",

This was one.  Had Rolling Smoke last night for the first time. It was the best. No seriously, I think it was the best I've ever had. (I'm writing this at 5am so you know it's real)  I had the 4 meat combo: chopped brisket, burnt ends brisket (OMG), chicken, and beef ribs. I paid extra to have the burnt ends and beef ribs and it might be the best decision of my adult life.  David at the front is super engaging and welcoming. I assumed he was the owner, he made us that comfortable.  ATTENTION ROLLIN SMOKE OWNER/OWNERS/OWNERSHIP GROUP Make this dude an owner or something. Sign him up to a long-term contract or just give him lots of money and make him promise not to leave.  That's about all. It is 5 in the morning and I have a fridge full of leftover bbq and it's not going to eat itself.  Thank God.",

    "text": "Surprisingly good BBQ in the oddest of strip malls. We missed it the first time around, it's by a Diamonds Cabaret Strip club and when we pulled in the store front is dark so it looks even closed. You'll see large BBQ smokers in the parkinglot so you know you're in the right place. It's open late-ish during the week, and 1:30 am during Fridays and Saturdays!   Bobby, Misti, and Mamie said something about grabbing some food to eat here after a UYE and somehow it struck a cord with everyone that BBQ sounds amazing and talk was rumbling about hunger that the rest of us decided to sort've crash on their idea.   The BF and I shared two dishes, made both a combo (drink and 1 side) -  Smoked meatloaf  was awesome. The BF says one of the best he's had. It's definitely great flavor and is a different style of meatloaf being smoked, then basted in some of the sauce and topped with crispy onion rings. It was on a bed of pretty good red skin mashed potatoes. If you love meatloaf, this is something to try.   Beef ribs are normally something we skip over, but seeing as they looked good and people were actually saying they were quality I decided we should give it a go. It was meaty, juicy and tender which is rarely achieved. I have to compare it to my holy grail of Phils in SD, and while it doesn't have that cracktastic crisp outside to moist (haha CHRISTIE O. ) inside, the quality is definitely there and satisfies that want for a good beef rib. So many places don't even serve it, just because of how hard it is to cook right. These were solid.   Our sides were also solid. The baked BBQ beans had pulled pork pieces in it and was very good and hearty. Potato salad is the red skin potato style mayo (no mustard) style and had crispy bacon bits and green onions on top. I like all kinds of potato salad and this was good.There was a little bread piece on the basket which was kinda stale and dry which was the only hiccup.  They have one kind of BBQ sauce and it's on the zesty and a tad spicy side which I enjoyed it a lot.   I really wanted to try a dessert, but we already had the major meat \"itis\". Maybe one day I will come back and eat something \"lighter\", you know, like a sandwich chaulk full of meat.   It's a order up type of place at the counter and serve yourself drinks out of the beverage closet (it'll make sense once you're there). The staff was friendly and made sure to check on us.    Apparently the owners are Arkansas folks and while that is a \"fringe\" state that normally people don't think about slanggin' the 'que, it takes on influence from the best ideas of the rivalry states, really.   I definitely think even from this first visit, this place raises the bar on BBQ offerings in this town. We will be back, probably really soon.",

The reason I only give 4 stars is because we were kept waiting for 35 minutes after we ordered, and people who came in and ordered after us got their food before we did. AND they must have had a VIP come in shortly after we ordered because they were sending out trays and trays of food before we got ours too. I mean, I understand having a VIP, but We shouldn't have to wait 20-25 minutes longer than we were told for what we paid for, and receive our food after others that came in and ordered well after we did.  We will be back again and maybe we'll give 5 stars :) the food is definitely 5 stars, service could have been better.",

You walk in and theres 1 menu on the wall  1 on the counter 2 rooms of seating and a few large tables outside.  The Menu options are plenty and the prices very reasonable I loved the brisket and their hushpuppies they were packed full of flavor and the service was very friendly!  I was lucky to go when it wasn't to busy but I hear this place gets packed during the lunch hour.  must be a local favorite and that's my kind of spot!

And prepare to fight for parking during the lunch rush. I went to Rollin Smoke days after returning from Lockhart, TX. I went not expecting to be impressed, but the pulled pork wowed me. It's usually something I prefer to make at home because it's not often I like it out. But this is tender, succulent and well smoked. The brisket was less impressive, I found it dry. I'd try it again when the sweet taste of central Texas wasn't so fresh. I might like it better. The combo I ordered also came with a dry burnt bun and I selected the mac & cheese for a side. It was pretty good, but I do prefer a creamier version.  My brother joined me for lunch, he had the baked potato topped with cheese and brisket. His order came out with pulled pork instead. No worries since it was a winner.  This was my first run in with Arkansas BBQ, they definitely make a great pulled pork. The jury is still out on the rest of menu. Must eat more to decide. The staff is super friendly and they're open late on the weekend.",

I've been spending all of my life dreaming of this Southern paradise. Well, at least the part of my life during which I have lived in Las Vegas because prior to that I was in the Southern paradise of Hotlanta.   Driving here you will have your doubts that you are actually going to end up at an establishment that serves edible items. You may even believe you are being drawn into a cleverly disguised strip club or an automotive shop, but if you have your windows down about half a mile away you will start to smell the que, and you'll know you're headed in the right direction.  I must say that I think their sides are even more delicious than their meat. I sampled their killer fried okra and baked beans, and I would go go back for those alone. But of course, their meat is delicious as well. I went with the two meat sampler and chose pulled pork and brisket. It is a generous heaping of meat. It was hard to tell where the brisket ended and the pork began, but they were both flavorful thanks to a sauce that is more spicy than sweet. The pork was a tad dry, but I didn't let any of it go to waste.   The environment is definitely casual, and in one room, they are using table cloths because there is apparently a couple of not so attractive tables hiding. However, the table cloths do lead to a lot of stains, so I hope they can wrangle some more attractive tables soon.   As for service, it is spectacular. The nicest bunch of Arkansas boys you could hope to meet. This should definitely be at the top of your short list of must-try BBQ in Vegas.",

I was looking for a place to have a relaxed team dinner and wanted to get away from the glitz for a bit.  Also, the team loves BBQ, so that was the criteria.  We went to RollinSmokeBBQ and this restaurant is just great.  Excellent tasting BBQ - the baby back ribs, brisket, hot links - just awesome.  Easy, casual ambiance.  Family owned business.  The owners were very accommodating to us.  The pictures on their website don't really show it but they have two small dining areas - the main area where you order your food, and then another separate eating area off in another room to the side.  That room can easily hold 30 people.  My group of twenty arrived, we sat down, ordered, grabbed drinks and the evening just got rolling.  It was easy as that.  We ordered 20 'all you can eat' packages but had the restaurant just bring it all out family style and place it on the tables.  The team dug in like piranhas - it was excellent.  It didn't take long for everyone to be bursting full.  All the food was great.  Excellent, friendly service.  The owners were very appreciative of our business.  After the meal, it was a nice walk back to the strip.    I highly recommend the RollinSmokeBBQ for your next Vegas team gathering.",

This little hole in the wall under the freeway overpass makes the best pork and beef ribs I've ever had!  So when it was time for me to return to SoCal I packed my car with 3 pounds of every kind of ribs they make and drove 'em home . And now I'm reaping the benefits . Just had a pool party and the ribs were an enormous hit . They reheat like a dream no matter whether I pulled them from the fridge or from the freezer . The sauce is super sensational  and the ribs are meaty succulent juicy deliciousness! . I'm gonna have to make a rib run up to Vegas next month just to get another hit from Rolling Smoke Barbecue.

You order counter style which allows for quick takeout but there are also plenty of tables and TV's if you prefer to eat on site. We shared the trio meat platter - everything was moist and tender, sweet corn bread was awesome, baked beans had a kick of spice. Club wrap was grilled and off the hook delicious!!",

    "text": "Meh. Let me start by saying I'm from Chicago. We may not have the most renown BBQ in the country but we have some pretty good BBQ spots. Therefore, I must admit that when it comes to recognizing a good BBQ joint, it's hard to pull a wool over my eyes.  So this place, great service. The guy who took our order was nice; our food didn't take ridiculously long to come out. My wife and I split a trio with chicken, hot links and spare ribs. For $17 & some change, I was disappointed with the portion sizes. 1 hot link (not sure why they said linkS), 2 medium size spare ribs, 1 chicken drumstick & 1 thigh. Sorry, I may be spoiled by Chicago's fine eating rep but $17 at a BBQ joint in Chi-town typically gets you A LOT MORE. I also decided to try a blackberry cobbler (the menu says blueberry but they have blackberry)  Food wise, it was ok. The rub on the ribs were \"OK\" (I've definitely had better). They weren't super tough but they weren't slide off the bone tender, they were somewhere in the middle. The hot link was actually good but it wasn't a smoked hot link that's standard for a BBQ joint but a pork hot link. The chicken was ok. My wife didn't like the seasoning on it so she peeled back the skin & put BBQ sauce on it. The blackberry cobbler was descent but considering the stark tartness of blackberry, it could've been sweeter to offset the tartness. Likely won't be back here next time in Vegas.",

The location is a little off the beaten path, but it is worth searching for. My husband and I came in late on a Friday Night, close to closing. The staff was very friendly and the wait for our food was painless. We ordered a rib special platter that came with baby back ribs, Louisiana style ribs, and one pork rib. Everything was fall of the bone tender and so buttery. Plus, it wasn't doused in bbq sauce. The spices were enough to carry the meat without it having to be swimming in sauce. When we were finished, I was disappointed that there wasn't more! Haha. We had banana pudding for dessert and it ended the meal on a great note. The only negative thing I can say is that the platter we ordered came with a side and toast. We had bacon potato salad that didn't stand out very much and we also got a piece of toast, which was just that: a piece of sliced toast. It was a little underwhelming. This being a BBQ joint, I was expecting something a little bigger like Texas toast maybe. But the real show stopper of course is the meat and thinking about the meat makes me forget about the sides. I can't wait to go back and try more. I've been raving about it to all of my friends.",

They also offer an all you can eat option, which I was eyeballing but glad I  didn't because I was stuffed and didn't finish my tray. MITCHELL is one of the coolest host I've come across. His upbeat personality made my first time here very memorable and he is a man of his word! He said that the food would be out in about 10 minutes and jokingly, I said I was timing him and he was definitely up for the challenge. 3 minutes later, my food was personally delivered by Mitchell himself! He was so hospitable - I am beyond impressed. We were even able to take a tour of the kitchen.   Mitchell, thank you so much for making our time here so memorable. I would give you 10/10 stars because that's what your deserve, but Yelp limited me to just 5. I will definitely come back next time I am in town!",

Although this is a smaller restaurant, the food is excellent. It's worth the wait..  We ordered all types of bbq, some of my favorites were the huge chicken wings. You can get them in all types of flavor, we got the honey bbq. They were delicious. Also, we had some tri tip, chopped and whole. The meat was super tender.. and it had the nice bbq/smoked taste I love. Nothing is better than some legit bbq with the smoked flavor, you can tell they spent a lot of time preparing and cooking the meats. They have all types of meat, to satisfy all your cravings.  Prices are pretty decent for some good bbq, it's never cheap. You get what you pay for, and everything is worth it in my opinion. This place is definitely a must go if you're visiting Vegas.",

The cashier suspected we were knew and handed us cups of waters and menus and told us to take our time reviewing the menu. There were a lot of open seats so we grabbed a picnic bench and pored over the menu. We settled on the plate with 2 bbq choices and a meatloaf. Good thing we were hungry--the portion sizes are huge.   The meatloaf was the best I ever had. With the crunchy onion and the mashed potatoes, it was heavenly. The ribs were fall of the bone delicious. The brisket was none like I've had before. Their sauces are to die for. My favorite is the vinegar sauce--pure amazingness.  Aside from pesky flies that were bothering me the entire meal, this was a solid experience. I can't wait to be back. Thank you for showing me what real bbq is about!",

    "text": "Wow! Surprisingly really good BBQ. We didn't know what to expect since the street getting to this establishment looked a little shady. We parked in the lot and walked in. Yup, I can deal with this. No ghetto-ness here! There is a large board with the menu and there is also menus provided by the staff.  You walk up and place your order. We ordered a smoking plate of the pork bbq ribs, bread and the mac n cheese combo and the fiancee ordered a smoked brisket sandwich. We also ordered the blueberry cobbler a la mode.  The ribs were really good. I like my ribs with a lot of sauce so luckily there was a bottle of sauce on each table. There are 2 dining areas with TVs, as well as outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is pretty much used for smokers.   The staff is really courteous, friendly and informative. If you're new to the restaurant, they are very helpful in making your decision. We did notice a lot of first timers.  The only issue we had, was that our food came out lukewarm. Not sure if the food was sitting out for a few minutes before serving to us, but it would have been tastier if the food was hot upon arrival.  Definitely recommend this place for those looking for a quick good meal off the strip. We had no wait, but after we placed our order, there was a line out the door. A lot of people ended up taking their food to-go, so that's a good thing if you plan to eat inside the restaurant.",

This was our last big eat in Las Vegas and I'm telling you, we should've eaten here every damn day and not wasted our time on anything else!!! I first found out about this place from a YouTuber I love, and had it bookmarked almost a year ago. I'm glad I remembered to check it out! We ubered here from the Bellagio which was about a ten minute drive, then ordered almost everything! We got a three meat plate and I think it's called the big Dave, a sandwich with brisket, pulled pork and hot links. I added Chipotle slaw and do yourself a favor and ADD IT TO YOUR SANDWICHES! OH MY GOD, my mouth is salivating. The meat was so tender, so caramelized on the outside and just melted in your mouth. Their BBQ sauce is PERFECT.  Seriously, I drowned my food in that BBQ sauce and wanted to plug it into an IV. Their mustard sauce and spicy bbq were great too, and when we ordered our food and found a table I saw a guest eating the moistest piece of cornbread I've ever seen. I went right back to the counter and ordered some! THE MOST PERFECT CORNBREAD IN THE WORLD. Went great with the other 6 sides we ordered! Meat fell RIGHT off the bone on the ribs when you used a fork! Not too tender to be a mess, but perfect in that once your teeth touch the smoked exterior of each rib, the meat comes right off. This will be my last meal before I die. You guys are geniuses, absolutely wonderful.",

    "text": "Rollin' Smoke is located in a weird business park complex which boasts the corporate headquarters of a place called \"Kiesub Electronics\", but also has 3 buildings in the same place that bear the Kiesub name. The complex/mini strip mall feels like someone's trying too hard to make their own little sandcastle come across as an empire. Tucked away on the side not visible to us immediately was Rollin' Smoke.   This was also part of my Vegas journey to find a good burger. Rollin' Smoke's got a burger called the Outlaw that they like to pile with brisket. People dig it, so I set out to try it out...only problem was, they were sold out.  I settled for a Brisket Dog instead, because I enjoy a good potato chip sandwich every once in a while. \"Puttin' Things on Top of Other Things Cuisine\" is totally in my wheelhouse. If it was just the dog, the brisket and the Arkansauce that they serve up, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but the cheese wiz on that sandwich really doesn't tie it together flavor-wise. I ended up scraping off the wiz after a couple bites, and it was much tastier that way.  The brisket...I dunno, man. I dunno what they do down in Texas that nobody else seems to be able to replicate, but this place didn't come close. It's just about Bludsoe's quality. Not quite salty and flavorful enough. Much as I hate being a locale champion, any BBQ that I've had outside of Texas just doesn't cut it anymore. I don't know what it is. The group I was with had the same impressions. It's perfectly fine, and it may very well be the best BBQ in Vegas, but it's pretty low on the totem pole in terms of overall rankings. The links are nothing special, and neither was the pulled pork. I'm not a ribs guy, but one of my group dug the ribs. So maybe order that if they're out of Outlaw Burgers. :)  We did all like their side dishes, though, so they've got that working, and the service was quite nice. People were pleasant and attentive. I probably wouldn't revisit the place, but it's not like it was an unpleasant dining experience.",

You can't miss the enormous menu and its gargantuan display.   The menu is part reflection of what they do. I ordered the Rib platter. It comes with three different types of ribs. For $18 this meal is a great value if you want to try them all. Small price to pay for a GLORIOUS meal with big size and taste where the meat falls off the bones (beef).   The sides I ordered were Mac N Cheese with an extra helping of Corn nuggets for another $2.50. The sides are glorious too. By far the best corn nuggets I had to date. I also received the banana pudding just by checking in thru Yelp, a $4 dessert for free. Just GLORIOUS.  Thanks Yelp and Yelpers for making this place possible to find.  Lastly, this place was featured on an episode of Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Enjoy!",

First off, I have to give Mitch at the register some serious credit here as he pointed us in the direction of the all you-can-eat option. $35 and you can literally eat anything you want from the menu in an hour. There was so much I wanted to try, this was really the best option and most cost effective.  Burnt Ends with Mac and Cheese was one of my favorites, as well as the smoked meatloaf. Peach cobbler ala mode for dessert really sealed the deal. Brisket was amazing as well. Honestly, if you're having the same commitment issues I have when there is good BBQ around, save yourself the trouble and try it all!  To top off this awesome visit, Mitch took us on a tour of the whole restaurant. Kitchen, all the smokers, got to meet the chef and our Pit Master! Truly an awesome experience. Will definitely be back on my next stop in Vegas in a few weeks!",

So \"Sean\" (the host at Mr. Mamas) suggested that we go here; WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  So much I came out licking other peoples fingers (I'm kidding)!! We got the AYCE special for $34.99, and the couple with us got a 2 meat combo plate and added a drink. The total was around $60 for both of us. This is an order at the counter, seat yourself place which I don't mind at all.   The AYCE special is anything on the menu any day and any time. The menu consists of a plethora of meats, burgers, sandwiches, sides, and desserts. I think we tried pretty much every meat in the place. Ribs, meatloaf, chicken, pulled pork and wings, just to name a few. If you have a hearty appetite, AYCE is the way to go.  For my meal, I got a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and spare ribs, and for the sides, my daughter chose yams, collard greens and, mac & cheese. The food was delicious. I really loved the ribs. They were so tender and meaty and fall off the bone. A good rib needs no sauce, and these did not need any. Speaking of sauce, they have like 5 different bbq sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy. I personally love a good tangy yet sweet based sauce, so I enjoyed their bbq sauce the best. But they have something for everyone. The chopped brisket was yummy too, although I would probably get the brisket sliced next time. The only thing I did not like was the mac and cheese. It was really bland, but they have like 10 other sides to choose from. I can't wait to come back for some more yummy BBQ. Oh yeah, and my family does not do creamed corn at all and neither does Sean (from Mr. Mamas). But he strongly suggested we try them and we did. Oh So Good!!!!  #BaptisteClan",

We spoke to a cop once inside who said he patrols the area but will come out from Summerlin as this is the best bbq spot in Vegas.   I ordered some baby back ribs and banana pudding. The food came out very quick. The food was amazing. Bbq sauce on the tables so you can put as much as your heart desires. I could only eat about half as it is a large meal for a woman. My husband chowed down his 2 beef ribs no problem.   The onion rings.. Very thin, dipped in batter and fried. Reminded me of the kind you would get on a cheeseburger. They were delish. Banana pudding --pure heaven. As your dug in you got some of the cookies and whip. I pretty much ate it first.  Wish they would open some more locations.. And even maybe expand the location they have. It's so popular and a well loved establishment by all. Share the love!",

Lizelle, the cashier,  was friendly and helpful if it is your first time. Ask anything on the menu. Service was also attentive. Both Lizelle and Karina were making rounds, cleaning up spills on floors, and checking that everyone was doing well.   Seating was on picnic tables which I thought was pretty cool.  Different sauces to try and generous if you're taking some to go too. The sweet sauce is like honey mustard, but even their default BBQ sauce is a safe bet for extra flavor. To go boxes and plates are on the counter next to cutlery. It's pretty  easy to get what you need.  I noticed their prices increased since last time I was here which was pretty disappointing though (minus a star) . BBQ is always gonna be a bit pricey, but is it worth it? I say, \"try it.\" Trio plate is a safe bet, and for me, it was good for two people. Ribs, sliced brisket, and pork, a side, and a slice of white bread for $17.99. Old menu prices were much more reasonable and would've kept me coming back.   Oh, Don't forget to bring your cup if you're a local...you save $2 on drinks if you remember to have it",

I've mostly stopped coming here on my own even though it is conveniently located near my office.  Portions are large so that does somewhat offset the price issue but taking food to go isn't always what I want to do.  Can be good for days when I skipped breakfast.

    "text": "The thing about BBQ is that places tend to specialize. It's few and far between that a BBQ joint does everything well. Either they're great at ribs, or great at pork, or great at brisket. But for whatever reason it's really hard for any barbecue place to be great across the board.  Well, stop the press. Because Rollin Smoke just raised the bar.  Every meat that comes out of the smoker is perfectly done. The ribs are served dry - the melted fat of the meat captures the hickory smoke and the dry rub is as good as they get. The pulled pork is great. The brisket is worth going out of your way for - and I'm somebody who generally isn't a huge brisket fan. The hot link has a nice slow burn to it.  The sauces served alongside the meat complement it well - but they aren't necessary. The Carolina vinegar sauce pairs best with the pulled pork - especially with a little slaw on top.  Their sides are impeccable too. Just really flawless.  Portions are huge too. I'll order a 3-meat combo here at lunch and gnaw on it for another full meal and a half.  I just can't say enough good things about this place. It makes me happy even just Yelping about it.",

Been here on multiple occasions and their food is consistently delicious. I get beef every time (beef ribs, brisket all ways), however I try their other meats when my friends get them and they are solid as well. Its one of those places that always makes you leave satisfied and feigning for a nap. The staff are warm and welcoming, and the decor is barbecue-y (a lot of Arkansas Razorbacks stuff).   A definite highlight of this place is their sauces. Their sauces have a ton of depth in flavor, and for the spicy lovers, their hot bbq sauce has a kick to it as well.   Prices are decent as I would definitely not consider this cheap eats, but this place is definitely worth the money. Visitors of Vegas should definitely try to visit this place. Oh yes, if you're going to strip clubs at night, pick one that is near this place because they open LATE.   Only downsides of this place is the location of the place (industrial, empty during the daytime, and I haven't been at night) and that parking is hard to come by because their lot is small. If you are not driving, consider using a rideshare program like Uber/Lyft to get there.",

The first order was cancelled b/c Rollin Smoke said that they were too busy. I called the store and the manager said put the order through again and it wouldn't be a problem. That they were busy but the order would be ready in 60-90 mins. Slow, but I didn't mind much. I thoroughly discussed the order w/ him as the phone call took about 20 minutes.   When the order arrived it is completely wrong! I made a $125 dollar order and couldn't even get the order correct. I called the next day to relay my complaint to the manager, but they were closed. I called back a few days later and an associate told me that there was not a manager who could help me nor was there anyone else at the business who could help me that was in the store. I wasted my time and money, I would not purchase again.",

Then there's the Mama's smoked meatloaf over a bed of mashed potatoes topped with onion rings.  Never has meatloaf tasted so good. You have to try their little corn fritters,  their string beans and potato salad.   Extra large servings. Casual atmosphere,  plenty of seating in and out. Staff was so friendly,  helpful.

    "text": "I'm known for flexing two things; my muscles, and my mouth. This BBQ joint forced to flex something entirely new to me; my floating ribs. (You know, so I could stuff more delicious meats into my expanding belly). This was an impromptu visit- I had very little time to prepare, so little that I, (yes me) arrived wearing a pretty teal dress and high heeled boots. Clearly, I wasn't prepared for the feast of sauces and meats that was about to grace both my lips, and outfit.  It's tucked in a gritty strip mall in Vegas, off the strip, near a strip club, and paired, ironically, with a Christian radio station. (WTF?)  We pulled in after a convention, at 6pm, and headed into the small storefront, as the 5-0 pulled someone over in the lot. The interior is coated in a mural, some yellow paint and stocked full of picnic tables in the color of barbecue sauce. (Appropriately) If you make your way towards the giant pig-head mounted chest high on the wall, you'll find the menus. Or read it from the ordering stand in the back right, where you can see a glimpse of the kitchen through a swinging door as you await blurting out your overly excited order. \"Meaty sampler for two, for me, but add a half pound of burnt tips, just the tips, that's what she said, sorry, I can't help myself, I meant burnt ends.\" the guy behind the counter chuckled, and asked what sides, sizing me up in my frilly girly attire. \"Corn nuggets\" that was the moment. The defining moment of the night. (I also got the Mac & cheese and greenbeens- a girl's gotta be sensible)  I gladly exchanged my cash for the idea that I'd soon have my hands (among other things) on this highly renowned meat. We found an empty picnic table in the side room, and I filled it with napkins and little cups of barbecue sauces in preparation. As I anxiously awaited my trays of food, I was entertained by the 5-0 who were busy just outside the window arresting two hoodlums and launching them into a paddy-wagon. Dinner-and a show? #Winning. I heard my name. \"Meg-Ann\" (close enough) and jumped up to claim my anticipated treasure. Before me was a tray coated with shredded chicken, smoked sausage, ribs, BBQ chicken and brisket.  I'm fairly certain my eyes grew to a third the size of my face, and I began drooling as I inhaled the scent of southern deliciousness. A second tray graced my presence- I got so giddy I *almost* peed. There they were, Corn-freaking-nuggets.  I squealed. The entire room responded to my outburst. Burnt ends. Ooey, gooey, meaty, melty tips of immense flavor and fat and fabulous that trumped everything else..., everything, that is, but the corn nuggets. Those little fuckers could easily be responsible for my crossing over from the fit-side, to the obese, type 2, side. And all without question. They're sweet, crunchy, and tender, and easily justified by the fact that they contain a vegetable (not that corn is an exemplary veggie). I allowed a few before it began. I rolled my shoulders back, tossed my hair behind them, and wiggled my fingers before diving into the trough of meat before me. I really can't explain what happened in those first few minutes. I remember the blue and red lights flashing across my face, lighting my blond hair in a blaze of color, as I mauled through flavors of carnal deliciousness. There was sauce everywhere... My face, my cheek, my forehead.... My hands, my arms, the table, my dress? And even some on the napkins I laid in preparation. I don't think I had a fork. Maybe I had one, but in the whirl of BBQ sauce and meat stuffs, and smokey flavor and blue and red lights and burnt ends, I can't see where it fit in, how, or if. I annihilated the burnt ends. They were truly the best and most succulent bits of yum that graced my lips (hair/face/clothing....) they didn't need the sauces, so I saved them for the chicken. All the meat was tender, busting with smoky flavor, and cooked with love. (Or lard. I get those two confused)  I wasn't able to eat it all. Those sit-ups only allowed for a slight expansion of my diaphragm, and I wasn't capable of shoveling any more deliciousness in. I tried. I tried so hard. And it was worth the carnage. The other patrons stared at me like I was a mystical unicorn vomiting rainbows. The girl they saw walk in morphed into a ravenous monster hell bent on BBQ domination. This was, by far, my favorite BBQ experience of my existence. I'm still questioning whether they laced the meat with LSD or some other psychotropic drug that could explain the transformation that took place that night. But I'll chalk it up to all that \"love\" they used in making my meaty meal. Yelp- this place knows BBQ, just don't be afraid to lose yourself in the magic and mayhem that is Rollin Smoke.  Side note- if you do come here on any type of psychotropic drug- be weary the wall mural- lots of faces- staring, judging, watching, waiting to steal what you don't swallow.....",

Rollin Smoke has come along way in such a short time, I remember when you could see the chefs in kitchen cooking up a storm from the front counter and the area when you walked in was the only place to sit.  Situated between the strip and the 15 highway, Rollin is on South Highland Dr inside a small strip mall. You will see the smoker and or food truck out front, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled.  The best recommendation for a Rollin Smoke lunch or dinner is: Everything..... From the Ribs to the Brisket and home made deserts, this place won't disappoint you. If your hungry go after the Outlaw Burger... It's one tough burger to get into, and you will be full after.  I will say due to being on a few tv shows recently, the lines might start to increase, so get in early!!!!!  Overall Price: $$ Drink: 3-5 (soda - no booze) Food: 5-5 Service: 5-5 Come back: everyday if I could   Catering: I'll add In here I had Rollin Smoke come to my house and cater my sons 1st birthday... There wasn't to many kids mostly adults.  The guys were amazing, coming early to setup and checking in on every one to make sure all was good throughout the party.   Bringing in a smoker to cater the party was also a pretty awesome choice, I'm pretty sure the neighborhood was drooling at the smell. Highly recommend for anyone and everyone... Also a real decent price....  Overall: top shelf",

Not too sweet and complimented the meat. Great spot!!!!",

I know they are trying to keep up with the popularity.  But I miss the \"we don't work on Sunday because we have to thank god for what we have\" attitude.

Ordered the 5 meat combo and it was garbage. Pulled pork and the pulled beef were both dry as hell, the brisket was tough, the links were cold and the chicken wasn't even worth mentioning but the 2 rib bones weren't too bad (Yes, I said 2). I was extremely disappointed. To make matters worse were ordered multiple 5 meat combos because there was like 6 or 8 people and once we got home we found they neglected to put one of the orders in our bags and refused to answer the phone when we called back. The peach cobbler is made with cake (NOT where I'm from...) They have sweet corn poppers (Eek Methinks not.) And the loaded potato was terrible. I've had better cheese on a movie theater nachos. It's ridiculous. Their prices are way too high for such raggedy service and poor quality food. Never again shall I darken that door. Rolling smoke and keep rolling right on past me.",

I got the chicken, hot link, rib, and pork with loaded mashed potatoes, salad and mac n cheese. Literally everything was top notch - especially the hot link which was very spicy and one of the best ive had. They also offer an array of sauces but the carolina was my favorite (spicy was awesome too). Between the two of us we shared the order and still had enough to take home for leftovers and made a tasty lunch the next day. Lizelle and Sofia were also really sweet and helped us make our selections being that it was our first time. We just beat the lunch rush and it got very busy but there is ample seating. Lots of locals come here so that made it feel like a secret little spot we discovered. We even kept our cups as a souvenir! Will definitely be back on my next trip.",

I'm in the military, so I moved out here from NC almost 3 years ago, and in that amount of time I've never found any place that was up to par with what I considered good BBQ. Memphis isn't very good. Famous Dave's is okay. Lucille's is pretty decent, but for the drive to Henderson (and fairly high price), it's just not worth a regular trip. Then I got tip from a new friend (who was also a fellow North Carolinian) about a place that was a little off the beaten path but well worth it... Rollin Smoke Barbecue. So we decided to give it a try. That leads me to this moment, as I sit here with a full belly typing this review. My wife and I both had the pulled pork sandwich. Her sides were Mac & cheese and potato salad, mine were Mac & cheese and hush puppies. All of which were delicious. The meat was tender, the bbq sauce was delicious and had just a little bit of spice to it. All the sides were awesome. And we washed it all down with the only kind of tea that should exist... SWEET. Then to get our sweet tooth fix we shared some banana pudding that was amazing. Even as I stuffed my face I was studying the menu so I could plan my next visit. Rollin Smoke is the real deal. Great barbecue and extremely friendly staff. If you're a local or just passing through and you're looking for an authentic barbecue experience, Rollin Smoke is where it's at!",

The bam bam size beef rib was fall off the bone tender, so tender the lady at the next table was trying to put her beef rib in her to go box and the meat from the rib slipped off the bone into her lap :). The spare ribs and baby back ribs were good, but unfortunately after eating the beef rib first, it just didn't compare.  The BBQ sauce here is the perfect mix of sweet, tangy, and spicy.  And the list of sides makes it hard to decide...unfortunately they were out of fried okra so instead I had a side of corn nuggets, and these things are magical, imagine deep fried cream of corn.  The customer service is great as well, they come around and check on you a few times to make sure you are enjoying the experience.  As I'm writing this review, I'm already planning my next order....perhaps beef rib with beef brisket and I'm determined to have some fried okra next time!",

He replied, are you going to order? My husband got a whole rack of spare ribs n I got the Trio Choice of 3 meats. I asked for mashed potato and cole slaw, i only got cole slaw.

After soaking it in about 2 to 3 cups of barbecue sauce it still didn't make anything better. I tried to let the reviews redeem themselves by ordering the peach cobbler, the crust was very soft and mushy. The peaches were cold and I'm sure they were directly from a can. They stated that the ice cream was Blue Bell and in fact it wasn't. I'm from Texas and know the ice cream very well, and what BBQ should taste like. I've had better ribs at chain restaurants where the meat falls off of the bone. Unfortunately this meat felt like it was fighting for its life to maintain a part of the bone. I was very disappointed to say the least. McDonald's McRib sandwich is a better BBQ choice than this restaurant and I haven't eaten at McDonald's in over 20 years.",

Don't get me wrong the staff was really nic e and the place was clean but, the food was totally different. First they got my hubbys order wrong, second our food came out COLD not warm cold, third my Rib Tips were so dry and though most of it was inedible, Fourth all the food that came out was sooo dry and flavorless it had no salt.  What a let down and waste money.    Oh and by the way this food also gave us upset stomach and disgusting burps.  Ps i recommend the Roadkill which beats this place by far.",

The barbecue sauce tasted putrid for want of a better word, like it was unrefrigerated for a long time.  We split a four meat platter as well and nothing about it was in any way remarkable. My wife commented that the ribs at the Gold Coast buffet are better, and I agree.  She ordered onion laces and they were just a pile of greasy limpness. I wish we would have taken a picture.  This place is nothing more than mediocre at best. Don't believe the hype on here. Plus, it is nearly impossible to find.",

There was no kind word or smile as she shoved my food into my hands. Never once did I hear , \"have a nice day or thank you \"  The food was great but the customer service didn't make me want to return .  I visited a place called Yardbird and all their staff smiled and said , Hi .  As I left Yardbird every staff member I came across smiled and said , thank u for coming, have a good day or come back and see us as they smiled .  I felt more welcomed and appreciated at Yardbird.  Good Customer service is very important to me.",

It's comparable to famous daves and memphis bbq but a little on the mom and pop's restaurant kind of service and ambience. Though they could use a little upgrade -- the place was tight, bbq were served on plastic basket with a wrap over the basket, sides were served in styro containers, you have to ask for plates or get it yourself if they have some out, the plastic utensils didnt look clean, sprite tasted funky or maybe it was the ice.  We ordered the platter (good for two) with four meats -- brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs. Pulled pork was the best out of all of them but again average compared to other bbq places. They only have one sauce on the table and it was watery -- the kind that will squirt on your shirt. The tip of the sauce container was not as clean as my (sort of ocd when it comes to food and food handling) self hoped it would be.  There were a few regulars but mostly tourists it seemed...  Despite of all that ive mentioned about the place being average, it's worth a try.",

Best banana pudding I've ever had, and I've eaten a monkeys share of banana pudding.",

Along with that he sat us down and hooked us up big time. Food is amazing and would highly recommend this to anyone.   DO NOT let the outside location cool you. You will see why the inside is packed along with the parking lot.",

I was in Vegas for about a week and this place stood out to me above most of the places I ate at here. I came here after walking around Fremont Street so it was on my way back to the Hotel.  At night this side street is dark and in an industrial part of town so if you're not used dark back roads come here in the day. The place seems small from outside but once inside it is pretty decent sized with outdoor seating. I got to the counter and the lady was nice enough to recommend the Rib platter special since I wanted to try so many different items. I also ordered the peach cobbler a la mode and a side of baked potato salad with two sauces their signature and their damn hot sauce. I took everything to go and once I drove 15 minutes to my room we tried all the food and it was amazing. It had a good hint of smoke and all the meat was soft and falling off the bone in the best possible way. The signature sauce was like liquid crack and I was about to drink it and the Damn hot was exactly what it says. I love spicy but the hot sauce burns all over your mouth so I am good with that but it had flavor so if you can handle it go for it. AS for the peach cobbler it was good and I like it but my wife likes crust and would have liked a bit more but flavor was on point. So I know I am coming back when I am in town and that happens at least once a year",

Ordered the trios which had 3 meats and sides. Portions wise it was big and thr food was cheap. The flavour for sure is smokey. I had the pulled pork,  brisket, and ribs. Ribs were ok. Pulled pork didn't seem to have much sauce (I would prefer some sauce). The brisket was too dry maybe they smoked it too long and dried out the meat. The sides I don't have too much to say... none of they were that great. Fries were a little greasy for my liking.",

I loved that the Chef came out to see if all we're doing well and even at times delivered food.   3) Again, the food was good ;) It looked good, smelled great, hit the spot and was plenty. Almost all of us brought a part back to our rooms.   4) I read other reviews and came when we wouldn't have to wait in line. It would be worth the wait even if we hadn't.",

I was on my way to school and my stomach was growling to the max! Luckily and fortunately this place was down the street from school as I was in a hurry for a quick bite. The nice young lady who helped me recommended me the \"Outlaw Burger\" it won \"Best of Vegas\" for a reason. That burger was stacked tall with meat, onion strings, bbq sauce and a cherry (pepper) on top with a side of mac and cheese. This burger tested my will, I didn't think I was able to eat this beast. But with determination and a empty stomach, I was able to tame this beast in about 10 minutes :D The burger was tasty and juicy, mac n cheese was delicious! Will be back with a group of my friends to see for themselves how great this place is. Kudos to the staff and the \"Outlaw Burger.\"",

Great service, they were very helpful with explaining the menu and making recommendations. A bit pricey but definitely worth it. The baked beans were  a little under cooked but good flavor.",

Menu is extensive and formidable. I would imagine it would take you 3 months of coming everyday to try it all.  The portions seemed a little small to me. The $3 extra to make it a meal with a side and drink with my pulled piggy sandwich was expensive for the tiny portion they served.  BTW, the sandwich was super delicious.    The hostess was goofy, energetic, and knew the menu really well.  She was a pleasure to talk to.  I think I would try the other BBQ places featured on yelp just to have a really good comparison as to which was the best.    Overall, it's a great off the strip place to try.

    "text": "Lets start with the food. Holy god, it's good. Damn good. The sides are generous and filling, the pulled pork is very satisfying. The hot links are cut and oozing flavor. You get a free dessert if you use yelp too so that's a plus. I also ordered the outlaw burger and was warned it takes about 15 minutes to make. I was okay with that until 35 minutes later it still had not come. The burger was amazing and I had only ordered a 1/2 pound of pulled pork and received well over a pound (I assume it was for the wait)  I ordered for two people and my name was the same as another patron so I'm assuming there was some confusion there. Which brings me to the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. The ordering and service wasn't great, but It wasn't bad either and the food more than made up for it.",

    "text": "Nice place.  Friendly.  Made me feel at home and seems to be family oriented.  I ordered the AYCE!  Big mistake,not because it was not delicious, but because it was way too much food.  I started with beef rib, pork ribs, hotlink, mac n cheese,greens, and somehow they threw a piece of fried catfish on my plate too.  Everything was awesome, especially the beef rib, very meaty and smokey. The only problem was that the link was not very hot both in heat and spice. I also had the fried shrimp and hushpuppies (I asked them to half the normal order for me cuz I was so full,  they said no problem) I finished with sweet potato pie and carmel cake. ohhh and i even asked them for a glass of milk to wash it down.  Not bad, not bad all!",

Thats the cool part.  I have had the pork ribs and then went back a week later for the beef ribs.  Both were awesome.  I am going to keeping taking my friends here.  These are the best ribs that I have had in town.  They also have a ground beef/brisket hamburger that I am dying to try.  This place has no thrills but incredible food.  Highly recommended for the food and adventure.",

    "text": "I actually signed up to write reviews just because of this delicious BBQ place!  This little BBQ joint is legit southern style great BBQ.  First off, it's not a real BBQ place until it has fried okra as a side and this place delivers on that as well as so many things.  Sweet Tea, yep it's effin delicious too.  The meat we had as our dinner were- ribs (fall off the bone when you pick them up) brisket (tender and it's got that gorgeous pink smoke ring and amazing flavor) and smoked sausage (has just the right amount of spice too it!) sides- okra and mac n cheese.  We are from Oklahoma and miss the craft and care that goes into smoking and creating amazing BBQ but we don't have to miss it anymore!  Service is amazing and friendly and we plan on taking our friends and family that visit us!  Thanks to the staff for the warm welcome and friendly atmosphere, seriously can't wait to come back and next time I'm going to have the berry cobbler too!",

    "text": "This is not Southern style brisket. It's chewy and fatty (i found three large chunks of fatty brisket that somebody could choke on if they tried to swallow it). Listen, I ate at 36 real southern BBQ joints last summer and this brisket would rank last. Website says he is from Arkansas, but I would like proof because the brisket doesn't qualify as southern. You can tell by the way he chops it, real BBQ brisket is more shredded. He also should know nobody serves brisket on a hoagie roll in the south, it comes on a bun. Rollin Smoke has two sauces, one claims to be hot, but both taste exactly the same, nothing stands out in that respect. Moving onto the side dish, which is in a tiny cup and not worth the $2. It was jalapeno coleslaw and wasn't too bad, but I honestly didn't see any jalapeno's in the cup. It also appears he has changed the prices - up of course - after being open a week. The online menu says a combo includes drink, chips and side for $2, now the chips are excluded. The price of 1/2 rack of ribs is $10 online and $12 on another menu that is off to the side inside the place, but on the official menu it is now $16. The big smoker on the outside and good smell makes this place appealing to the eyes and nose, but it doesn't pass the taste test. If you do go, show the website coupon on your phone to save 10 percent and that way when you get home and eat your nasty brisket at least you will have saved some money and won't feel as bad.",
