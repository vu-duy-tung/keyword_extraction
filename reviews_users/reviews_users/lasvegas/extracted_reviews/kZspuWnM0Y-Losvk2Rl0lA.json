I would give this a negative if I could. Ughhhhhhh terrible!!!!! DO NOT GO HEEERRREEEEE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

You order at the counter from very kind and attentive staff. They helped guide me in the direction of my craving for something bready with meat by suggesting their gyro. It was tasty - like you would expect a gyro to taste. I also had the sweet potato fries which I found was odd for a Mediterranean cafe. They were also good, but not as crispy as I prefer them. While the place appeared clean, it was a bit run down and in need of repair. The decor was mostly French inspired.",

The meat was perfection the pita that wrapped it was soft and delicious. The half pastrami sandwich was really more like a full sandwich. The dolmades were the best I've ever had! But it the baklava that has me leaving this review. Oh my gosh! The owner told me it was going to be the best. He wasn't lying. It is indeed the best I've had, even though I'm eating it the next day. I will definitely stop here again on our next trip to Vegas.",

Twice I ordered the shrimp skewers plate. Both times, the shrimp were cooked perfectly! The plate comes with hummus (I think it's a red bell pepper hummus), pita, veggies, and Israeli couscous.... Oh, that couscous. It is SO GOOD! I've made couscous several times and each time, it comes out quite bland. This place works some magic on the couscous because it is really flavorful!  The last time I went, I ordered the lentil soup. Upon first sight, I didn't think I'd be impressed. The broth was watery and the lentils whole. I was expecting more like a split-pea soup. But the soup was hearty and delicious.   Would highly recommend Cous Cous! (And they serve beer and wine. Bonus.)",

Right in front of the entrance, scaffolding and counter weights for the zip line, what an unpleasant view. but inside, the seating is close and comfortable with cushioned benches that are group together for intimate conversations.  The colors are jewel tone and rich.  The menu is huge with everything from wraps, burgers and kabobs, to salads and subs.  We started with an appetizer, the sample platter, which includes falafel, hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki.  It was delicious and generous in portion sizes.  For our main entree, I got a beef kabob.  They marinate the kabob in grated onions, herbs, and add a special house seasoning.  It was tender and very good.  The roasted veggies that came with it included zucchini and summer squash, egg plant and there was side of hummus, saffron rice and a grilled pita.  I was getting too full from eating the appetizer, but the food was really good.  What I couldn't eat, my husband finished.  Would recommend to everyone.",

Believe it or not I don't really want a buffet or $6.99 prime rib Monday-Friday. This new little cafe popped up and gave me another option to explore.   Let me begin with the couscous. YUM! I could just eat a plate of that and be done with it. The chicken skewer is tasty and the sides of veggies, pita and gyro sauce is more than enough for lunch. I had the gyro platter last time, also delicious. That's also when I began my couscous love affair. The menu has a good variety. Not the cheapest lunch in town but the portions make up for it. The staff is really nice and checks up on you as you enjoy your meal. They offer gelato but I have yet to try it.   Go try it, even if it's just for a little snack of pita and sauce, so yummy. I hope this place makes it in the sometimes dicey shadow of Neonopolis.",

Their hummus is out of this WORLD.  I actually liked it more than the wrap that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.  If you're a hummus lover, as I am, your life is not complete without trying the hummus HERE.  (You can thank me later.)  ; )",

I've had better in Southern Cali, but when you are in the mood for this type of food and don't want to drive far from downtown Vegas to get some....this place will do until they closed their doors because most businesses close their doors within 5 years.   The girl that took our order was polite and checked on us.   The food was ok, not great or something for me to shout to the world about. It gets the cravings satisfied. Not too bad.  We order the chicken and beef pita and 1 order of fries.  Came out a little over $22 bucks, sorta on the pricey side.   If you are nearby and don't want Dennys, this place might work for you. Otherwise....it's not a place I would go back.",

I get that sometimes food prep is less than desirable in a tourist spot like this, but to get horrible food AND have the staff not look you in the eye and show any form of common courtesy, is unacceptable.  I wish we had walked just a little bit further down Freemont St., to one of the many \"off the Freemont Experience\" places for good food and friendly service.   A mistake that will not be repeated.  And don't even get me started on how much my wife despises this place. Her experience was even worse.",

On my second trip I had the veggie bowl, add lamb. The sign is a little misleading as it says that the bowls are $5.99 ( I think) and you have your choice of veggie, chicken or etc. However, at the register she is very clear about asking if you would like to add Lamb or chicken for a charge. I did and I'm glad that I did. It was really good and worth the $9 or $10. It is a quick and easy healthy option for downtown.   Also, the staff is great. I really liked the girl behind the counter, and not just becuase she said my name reminded her of a movie star. She's cute, friendly, confident and seems like she doesn't take any crap. She's got a great sense of humor and I had a good time while I was there.   At first I thought the only alcohol they served were these little togo wine glasses. They seem cute but I wasn't in a wine mood. I guess I never looked up, becuase they clearly have all the beers lined up on the top shelf. Anyway thank goodness for that because it was well past beer thirty when we got there.   Pro tip: Bathrooms are for customers only, so you need a code to get in.   Also, you can call ahead for your order if you are in a hurry.",

    "text": "Experience:  My second time here, so it deserves a review. I came here once before on a Vegas downtown food tasting tour. This time a group of friends met for dinner. It was 6pm on a Wednesday.   Facility:  This is more like a fast food type spot. It takes a little bit to make, but you order at the counter and food is fairly cheap. They do have some bottle beer and boxed wine. They have a few half bench half stool seats, and a few traditional table and chairs. I love the giant rustic chandelier and the metal wall art, but otherwise it feels very fast-foodish.   Service:  The lady working was neither nice or friendly, but she was fairly attentive. However, her manager did not teach her the golden rule about customers in person take priority over the phone...she stopped in the middle of taking my order to answer and help the person on the phone.  She could have answered and put them on hold, but whatever.    Food:  We ordered the sampler platter to share, and I got the Lamb Shwarma with rice as my meal. The food on the platter was good. It had warm pita bread 4/5, tzaziki sauce 5/5, tahini sauce 1/5, falafels 3/5, hummus 4/5, and baba ganoush 3.5/5. The Shwarma plate was decent. The lamb was good and moist 3.5/5 served over the rice 2.5/5.  I typically love Mediterranean rice, but this was short grained and had spices and saffron, which was a little different than I'm use to. I like the long, white, buttery kind more. There were a tiny bit of grilled veggies 3/5 on the plate too. It was also served with more hummus and pita.    Overall: I like this place, and would probably stop again if I'm downtown having drinks and in the mood for gyros or Shwarma.",

The food is edible, but not really worth it. And definitely don't get the poutine fries. They were the saddest poutine fries I've ever encountered.",

While the meat itself was decent, the bun was pretty bad.  Think burger king bun.  Also the fries that came with it were quite soggy.    So what can I say? I expected more from a $10 lamb burger.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because I DID order a burger at a Mediterranean place, even though the servers and cooks spoke to each other in Spanish. Maybe their Mediterranean dishes are better ...  2.5 stars rounded up to 3.",

My spanakopita was not the flaky triangles of spinach delisousness I am accustomed to, instead it was like fillo dough layered on top of spinach. Their medditeranian salad isn't bad, but I'm not sure what's medditeranean about it... iceburg lettus, bannana peppers, feta cheese and onions. I was sad they did not have tabouli on the menu, a legit medditeranean salad made with parsley. They also were lacking baba ganoush and stuffed grape leaves, which are two things that I expect to see in a medditeranean restaurant. This seems more like an americanized version of medditeranean food, similar to Zoey kitchen. My husband enjoyed his gyro and I don't regret stopping here, but I don't imagine I'll be doing it again.",

My girlfriend and I each had the chicken shawarma plate--hers with couscus, mine with salad.  The salad option, by the way, cost an additional dollar.  Whatever.  The service was HORRENDOUS.  First, the girl spilled my friend's dish and didn't clean it up/bring out another napkin/or apologize.  Second, any extra anything costs a dollar.  (I despise being nickled and dimed to death--especially when I'm getting charged eleven dollars for some lettuce and chicken).  But third, and most annoying of all, I DIDN'T ORDER CHICKEN.  I ordered the gyros plate.  When I went in to let the lady know I'd gotten the wrong dish, she advised, \"No, you ordered the chicken.\"  Well, no, I actually know what I ordered, thanks.  There was no offer to fix it.  Nothing.  She advised me that for another three dollars, she'd make me what I ordered (say what, now?!).  I politely declined.  She said, \"Is that ok?\"  No, ma'am, it is absolutely not ok.  And I won't come back.  Kabob Korner it is.  Cheaper and friendlier for the same mediocre grub.",

    "text": "You really have to be looking for this place to find it, but it's definitely worth checking out.  It's located in Neonopolis just west of the Heart Attack Grill.  The place is tiny and cute, and the food is classified as Mediterranean, and made to order.  Menu items include: pitas, skewers, soup (gazpacho, lobster bisque), sandwiches, coffee, gelato, and assorted other desserts.  I decided to try the lobster bisque; the soup was pretty good - It's rare to see lobster bisque on a menu in Vegas, and it was just what I wanted now that the weather is getting cooler.  Since the place is so small, it's only natural to strike up a conversation with the other patrons since you're practically sitting together, which is a refreshing change from the surrounding bars and casino restaurants.  If you come across this place, stop in and check it out.",

That's where Fremont Mediterranean came to my rescue.   It is so calm and peaceful in here, that my rushed feelings of getting to the airport and back to reality vanished while here and I stayed close to a quarter hour longer than I had intended. Of course that was also because of the food.  Finally, I had found some fresh, healthy food full of vegetables!. I was so excited to see a beet salad on the menu. Their's is with golden beets, sliced toasted almonds and fresh goat cheese, with a wonderful vinaigrette over lettuce. YUM! I had to have the baba ganoush too, which is served with warn pita. I couldn't eat all of either one of them because of the generous portions though the salad I ordered was the small size and the baba was an appetizer.  My friend had a wonderful fatoush salad and dubbed it the best she had ever had. It had lots of fresh greens, and fried pieces of pita.   The staff here are so helpful and friendly. You can tell they are passionate about the food. The cashier exclaimed,\"yum!\" when I ordered the baba, and the guy who took our cleaned plates was so happy my friend loved the fatoush.  Definitely stop in here for some great, fresh food and a relaxing atmosphere, if you are on Fremont Street.",

Food: 3.5/5, overall tasty but nothing special. It would be nice to get crispier fries though. The food came out in a reasonable time after ordering. Decent prices ($7.95 for a burger and fries, $11.95 for a chicken kebab plate with cous cous and hummus) given Vegas restaurants jack up their prices. They serve Mediterranean salads, pita wraps/kebabs, burgers, and panini sandwiches.   Service: 2/5, the young lady who works both as the cashier and waiter couldn't care less about being there. She interrupted us ordering our food to go serve food to other guests seated and did not smile, say hello or ask us if we need anything else.",

She didn't apologize for the wait or for being out of rice..I didn't want rice but she was telling others who stood in line for 15-30mins they were out...ummm, put a sign up or let the line of customers know maybe; especially when you're taking 10 years to process orders and such.  I'm not a hard person to please because of my extreme passion for food but this was THE WORST GREEK APPETIZER PLATTER EVER: pita bread was super hard which sucked, the falafel was over-cooked and they replaced what was supposed to be the babaganoush with some tastless weird red mayo mix.. The hummus and taziki was not aweful and prices were pretty good but I will never reccomend this place. I hope they get it together; it's Vegas and there are so many options for food! They really should step it up considering they are the only Greek available right on Fremont.",

The Pita bread also seemed old and stale. My husband had the same experience with his falafel wrap. I give 2 stars because the fries weren't bad... but also nothing special.",

She had couscous and I had rice. My lamb was tough and fatty. I had to spit a chunk of meat in my napkin cause I couldn't chew it. Rice was average. My sister said couscous ok. Owner asked me if I tried my sisters couscous. I told home I didn't like the large pearl couscous. He said, \"How do you know, you didn't even try.\" I told him I don't like that large pearl couscous. I told him I like small couscous. Finally he backed off.  Pita very good and hummus average. Very homey atmosphere. Owner is very friendly. Overpriced.   Not impressed. I recommend Shwarma on West Craig Road. Meat is tender and flavorful. Rice is delicious. Hummus and tzaziki is great. Owner doesn't have to come out and schmooze customers because the food speaks for itself.",

I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, so I asked for recommendations and a gentleman recommended their beef kebab plate and the cashier recommended the champagne slushy, so I ordered exactly that! Soon after i ordered, my food was brought out by a dark haired young lady, she was very attentive & friendly. WOW!!! The food and slushy was very delicious! It was surprising to see how busy it was but still receive great customer service! The food was so good, I came back down on Monday with a friend. This time when I walked in, the digital menu immediately caught my attention. It brightened up the place. I wanted to complement how nice it looked so I got to talking with the gentleman named Christian, who mention that Couscous is his family owned restaurant. He then introduced us to his wife which was the dark-haired young lady from Sunday. Over all, I have to say coming from a local , this  place is definitely a go to when in Downtown Las Vegas! I will be a returning customer!",

If you're traveling with kids or more picky people they have things like chicken wings and mozz sticks,  also delicious burgers and salads. Wraps too! All of the Mediterranean selections taste authentic and delicious.   The service is always on point and if you're lucky to be there while the owner is he is such a sweetheart! The restaurant has a nice ambiance with plush bences, also cute tables and a nice outdoor patio.

    "text": "The worst experience I ever had a restaurant in my life. I went in stood look at the menu for about 5 mins figured out what I wanted then went to the counter to order my food but I had to use the restroom. I ask the lady at the counter may I have the code so I could use the restroom, she was so rude to me. She literally said no it's for customers only, which I understand that part but It's the way she said it to me and she also didn't even ask me whether I planned on dining with them or not. I politely let her know I've been standing in your establishment for 5 mins looking at the menu &d it wasn't for my health. Finally get the code use the restroom and order the chicken Greek salad, which was the worst Greek salad I ever had in my life. First thing is they give u 4 small pieces of chicken for 3.50 extra and they were dry, there was barely any cheese, barely any tomatoes but a ton of olives and onions on the salad. U could tell the person that was making it didn't really care about the food. Tried to sit down in the restaurant but all the tables were dirty &d I didnt really want to bother the lady at the counter again so I just left and eat the salad somewhere else.",

    "text": "I made a quick late night pit stop to Cous Cous Cafe during a recent trip to Vegas.  It is located right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience so you can't beat the location.  There are a lot of late night options in this area but everything feels like your average pizza stand.  Cous Cous was a nice break in the normal pace with a clean and inviting ambiance, which is highly appreciated late at night in Vegas.    The menu is typical Mediterranean and is extensive.  It's a little pricey for this area of downtown Vegas.  Most of its neighbors are offering $2 tacos but Cous Cous is holding strong to a gyro for $8.95.  I'd love to stay that you get what you pay for, but it's only A-Ok.  The food didn't seem like anything more than fast food pitas.  Whatever they lack in deliciousness, they make up for in fun, personable service!",

I didn't get the warm fuzzies, or felt like my business was particularly valued, but I guess that's what you come to expect from a fast food joint on Fremont St. The restaurant was clean, however, and I value cleanliness.   The Beef Shawarma was good. The beef was barely warm, but had great flavor. You can tell it would have been amazing had it been fresher. The vegetables were mush, but had good flavor - I'm just big on texture, so I didn't go for a second bite. The cous cous was really good (as I was hoping, considering the name of the restaurant), and I thoroughly enjoyed the hummus and pita. It was nearly 10pm, so I could understand why some of the food wasn't as good as it should have been.   My partner, unfortunately, didn't enjoy his dish as much as I had enjoyed mine.",

HOWEVER, today I dropped in for my usual and upon digging in, I noticed HALF of the beef/lamb meat was missing. I asked the server what gives and apparently mgmt let their old cook go bc he was using too many ingredients. They now weigh each plate before sending it out. Gone was the familiar hearty gyro with 7-8 slices of meat. I ate a sad sandwich with only 3 slices and left hungry.   I understand the economics of running a business; if you need to stay profitable, bump your prices like everyone else, don't serve me a pathetic sandwich. Sadly, that was most likely the last time I visit Cous Cous.",

We were looking to enjoy food in a cool environment but instead it felt hotter inside than it did outside.  Secondly for $20+ for two gyros I expected more. They were a decent size came to our table warm but for me something was lacking. Definitely edible but average.  Not over the top. I felt like I needed more sauce. My husband enjoyed it slightly more than me. Overall it didn't distinguish itself from any other Mediterranean place here in Vegas.  If you are in a pinch for a quicker place for food it might work for you but if you have a choice pass on it you won't be missing anything.",

My cousin's salad was carefully prepared and abundant. The Sampler Platter my husband got was also very good. Thalia came out to check on how we liked our food. The other cool thing is every question we had (bathroom/internet) was printed on the receipt. Will definitely return on the next trip and hope for another positive experience.",

Total cost was $29.  A little more than I expected, but the food was solid and we were hungry. Well worth it.   The wrap for the gyro was absolutely delicious and soaked up all the oil and juices. The fries were thin cut crispy with soft insides; my favorite kind of fries!  My girlfriend had the lamb burger with a greek salad. I don't usually like lamb meat because I find the meat too pungent and gamey (people who have had fresh venison or elk will understand what I mean), but this lamb was INCREDIBLE. The best lamb burger I have ever had.   They have a little gelatto ice cream station that I really want to try out. Definitely check this place out if you're in the Fremont area.",

    "text": "This place is ideal if you want to take a break from the Fremont  Experience craziness and not into gorging at buffets.  Though Fremont Mediterranean Cafe advertised their food as being healthy, it's a 180 degree departure from what the Heart Attack Grill was selling just next door!  I came here for a late bite and not really in the mood for anything heavy or big.  The place was near closing so there wasn't that many people there.  However it's a rather small eatery with very sparse decor with none of them anywhere near Mediterranean.  Got myself a Chicken Shawarma pita pocket which had marinated chicken strips, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, slivers of red onions, and a touch of tahini sauce.  It wasn't all that big but big enough to fit in the palm of my hand.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and delicious but I prefer having a bit more veggies in my pita.  At nearly $9, it was a tad on the pricey side for what I got but the cafe is located right smack in the middle of the Fremont Experience area.  I asked for a cup of water and was charged 25 cents for ice.  In short this place was not bad at all.  It served rather delish food and you can't beat the location.  The restaurant itself was fairly clean and the only interaction I had with a worker was at ordering at the counter and having my food brought to my table.",

Plenty of vegatarium and non Greek items.  They even have burgers.  The food was good and the service was fine a bit slow but not terrible.  Want a different food on freemont give it a shot.  I had the Gyro and the bread was fresh and the meat was well seasoned just not a lot of meet. But with all the salad and other things piled in I left full",

But they have excellent food right here.\" He pointed to this unassuming Mediterranean restaurant.   Since I am trying to lose weight, I was trying to avoid the hamburgers and greasy fried food that is everywhere.  The menu at Cous Cous is fairly simple with the obvious mediterranean   food. It also includes salads, wraps, sandwiches, and burgers.  I ordered hummus and a chicken gyro. Both were delicious! The pita bread was warm and soft the chicken was deliciously seasoned and not overcooked and the hummus was tangy flavorful.  I will definitely be going back  However, my favorite part of the restaurant was the people. Our server/host/entertainer, Joshua, was absolutely delightful!   In summary, this was an excellent dining experience for not a lot of money.  Oh, The beer next-door was really really good too. But I'll save that for my next review :)",

The cous cous that it was served with also tasted amazing. The pitas here are warm, soft, and chewy. The hummus is tangy and very flavorful. The classic gyro was better than any gyro I have ever tasted. The falafel was hot, and had a good crunch... I am not a big fan of falafel but this was great. The French fries and onion rings are hot, crispy, and are generously portioned. The poutine fries were also crisp and were not soaked at all by the gravy and feta cheese. Last but not least the baklava was sweet, gooey, nutty, with nice crisp layers of fillo. The only complaint I have is everything on their menu should be one dollar cheaper. Other than that everything is great. 4.5 / 5",

Additionally, the sandwich was actually pretty delicious and fresh which was totally unexpected from a Fremont Street/DT Vegas chain on a Sunday night.  On the other hand, I asked to add pepperoni (got peperoncini at first, then added the right thing) and I asked for NO CHEESE. This is not a fancy-person affected lifestyle choice: I am highly allergic to dairy products. The first half of my sandwich was delicious and amazing and as I ordered. The second half had cheese, and I could have died.  So... Three stars? ... and a recommendation that they read order slips more carefully.",

Hubby got the chicken shawarma and I got the chipotle chicken tortilla wrap. We also got an order of poutine. The lady that took our order was friendly and our food was done within 15-20 minutes.   What a great lunch! And super filling! I kept eating my wrap even after I was full. It was packed full of fresh ingredients and the chicken was thick and flavorful. His chicken shawarma was amazing too. I had never eaten poutine before, but this was a great place to try it for the first time. The prices are good and the service was quick when we went. They serve beer and have indoor/outdoor seating - perfect for watching all the action on Fremont.",

    "text": "How they are still operational is beyond me. They couldn't do ONE thing well. Both service and food are equally terrible.   The falafels I ordered were crunchy on the outside but totally undercooked on the inside, you could taste the baking powder, it was mushy, NOT like any falafel I have ever had in my life.   The tahini was flavorless.   The fries were soggy.   They sold me rice and after one bite I noticed it had butter in it, I went over to the lady at the counter and asked her if it had butter and she said \"yes\" I said \"Oh it's because i'm lactose intolerant, I had no clue the rice came with dairy\" she goes \"Hah, that sucks uh\" and just sits there smiling at me.   I paid $30 for the most disgusting plate of food in my life. Avoid this like the plague.  Edit: The fact the owner of the establishment responded blaming me for simply relaying my honest opinion about the experience I had, says all you need to know about how this place is operated. Also, I did not complain about the fact that the food did not meet my dietary guidelines, I just wanted to confirm it truly did contain dairy. It is just incredibly unprofessional for someone to be that dismissive and laugh at my face for simply asking a question, I wasn't asking for \"free food\" or for her to swap it out to anything.   Their food is poor. Their service is terrible and clearly, management is unprofessional and disrespectful so it seems like it stems from the top.",

The cashier told us that we the only way was add a salad for $9.99 are you kidding me? They don't have sides either. We paid $2 extra dollars for tzatziki sauce WTF??? The rice wasn't cook enough and we wait at least 30 minutes to get our food! NEVER AGAIN",

The menu has a lot to choose from. I find there aren't too many Mediterranean options around here.  I spent about $15 on two items for lunch and I was very happy. I got the Lamb Gyro. Very flavorful and not messy to eat. The lamb was cooked perfectly. I don't understand why the lamb is mixed with ground beef. I don't like beef and couldn't take it out. Some people just like lamb so having it prepped without beef would be great.  For an appetizer I had the Tzatziki  yogurt with extra pita bread. Very light and full of flavor. Great as an app or a light lunch. Even good to eat the next day for left overs.  The girl who took my order got the job done. Wouldn't say she was OVERLY friendly but could have smiled more or made a few recommendations when I said I never came here before. All and all I would come back. Maybe for sit down next time and see how that goes!!",

We figured we would find a bite down here but when we started to explore Fremont Street nothing looked good until we stumbled upon Cous Cous. Cous Cous is located near the Heart Attack Grill. I refused to eat at the Heart Attack Grill for multiple reason so greek food it was. My husband ordered the gyro supreme with fries and I ordered a gyro with onion rings. The difference was his gyro had cheese and mine did not. I thought for an extra $2 it was sort of a rip off but who I am to judge a cheese lover.  The gyro was decent and really hit the spot to help soaked up some the booze I drank earlier. Our order did take a few minutes to come out and there was only one other couple inside the restaurant. The fries were more than enough for one person and I would suggest sharing an order. The onion rings could be also enough for sharing but honestly I polished them off myself since I was quite hungry at the time.",

We had an order of hummus to start, my husband had the gyro with fries while I had a falafel with pita. I ordered an unsweetened iced tea and they brewed a fresh pot just for me!! :)  Our meals were brought out to our table- everything was delicious which was great bc we were so hungry! Lol.  The hummus was a generous scoop. They don't skimp on portion sizes here. One of the employees would come refill my drink every so often. I really can't say enough great things.

The falafel was not your typical round balls but rather a hamburger shaped patty. The flavor was decent but it was an odd orange color. The pita itself was a bit tough. The way they had it wrapped encouraged eating it from the top down. It had an OK sauce with lots of cucumbers and tomatoes at the top. This helped because there was no falafel pieces to bite in to at the edges of the pita. However,  once at the bottom I was left with a pita full of dry lettuce, no sauce, cucumber or falafel left. Overall it was very disappointing. Maybe if I had cut it all up and mixed it first it would have been better?",

My husband actually only went here to get food because the guy at Kabob Korner was too busy to take our order. Not, \"We're really busy, so the food will be ready in an hour\" but \"Come back to actually place your order in a half hour.\" I have to love the questionable business decisions of Fremont East restaurant owners (see also Le Thai). But I digress.  The hummus was good although I do not think it was accompanied by a sufficient quantity of pita. The falafel were kind of soggy and questionable even before I got to the horrifying hair lurking within. And everything is overpriced. Skip this place.",

These two couldn't come up with 5 IQ points between the two of them.  Just before getting my food I got up to ask for my money back because I had zero faith the food would be good and I was refused a refund. No manager or owner is on site so genius #1 calls the owner who said I could not have a refund as he didn't want to \"waste food\".    But it's ok to have terrible customer service.",

Instead of using pita bread, they used a stale, old torilla.  2. The food came COLD. Not room temperature cold, FRIDGE cold!  3. Everything was smothered in some weird tasteless reddish brown sauce. They tried to tell me that it is tahini sauce. 4. When I took the food back and told them it was awful and that I wasn't going to eat it. They tried to tell me that the food was cold because the vegetables were \"Fresh\". I explained that the chicken too was cold. The owner just stared at me. I said I wasn't going to eat it. And they continued staring at me. Didn't offer a refund. Didn't offer to make something else. Didn't offer to warm it up or to remake it. Nothing.  5. Rude service. Terrible, terrible, terrible food.

The place still had a crowd early in the morning. It's a pretty small place, but there's more than a few tables inside. There wasn't much of a line. My attention was grabbed by the slushie machine that mentioned ones made with alcohol. Not only were we hungry. On top of that we were fucking hot and thirsty. I ordered the mango flavor. It's $12 for a massive size. Much better than getting one of those oversized frozen cocktails on the Strip and you pay more than this. I also ordered a falafel pita. It's about $8 which is good for the amount. This was a massive pita.   I could sure come here again. I couldn't finish this the same night so I put the slushie in the freezer and had it with the falafel the next morning. They were good even sober.",

On my recently visit I had the chicken shawarma plate which came with rice, seasoned chicken, taziki sauce, hummus and pita. The chicken and rice were decently good. They were well flavored and cooked well. The  hummus and pita were lacking. The pita bread was kind of hard & I didn't care for the indents. The hummus was in need of more flavor, it was pretty bland.  Overall the food was okay, but not worth the price. I'd say for elsewhere for that Mediterranean craving.",

The gyro, to be fair, was tasty. But the meatball sandwich I ordered a few days later was so salty, flavorless, dense and dry that even though they accidentally made me a whole sub instead of just half, I tossed the remainder in the trash because it was just awful.   That said, the employees were always friendly and helpful but (as with many low-volume spots Downtown) very little sense of urgency. Although there's a small patio in the back tucked away from the main drag, their interior \"booths\" against the wall are almost impossible to sit on because they're so narrow at the seat and at a 90 degree angle. You literally slide right off them!   I was also very disappointed in the online ordering system. I placed a simple order through Yelp (which then places the order through GrubHub,) and walked down from The D Casino to the shop to pick it up: 15 minutes total. I was sure that my order would be nearly done by the time I arrived. In reality, it hadn't even been PLACED yet. I showed the cashier my email confirmation and they started to make it and about the time they handed it to me, the order came through from GrubHub. *If* I was to order from here again, I definitely would just fall the restaurant instead of placing it electronically.",

I can tell you that they did not cook the chickpeas enough, they did not add enough tahini (if any was ever added), there is practically ZERO olive oil, and I don't taste any hint of garlic, whatsoever.  Basically, in layman's terms, the cook is very cheap and impatient, and wasn't willing to add any of the GOOD stuff that makes hummus taste so good. If you're a Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern aficionado, then this place is not likely to pique your fancy.",

Because I asked them to re cook the meat and it still came out well done! So disappointing.. anyway.. the girl in the front had attitude because I sent the food back! Well, if you don't know how to cook medium meat maybe you shouldn't ask \"how do you want your meat cook\" #sigh   Hummus is okay! Nothing special. Definitely won't come back even if it's given for me for free!   Oh one more thing! Nothing in the menu is available! Everything is like \"we don't serve that anymore\" hmm. Then update your menu.

My mom had been stressed out and was trying to relax when Joshua Burkett, (one of?) the assistant manager(s?) came out and started chatting with us.  He listened to her troubles and concerns while our food was being cooked, offered a drink to help with the stress, and then stayed and continued to chat as we ate.  That is not to say that he neglected the duties of his job.  He would occasionally walk off to take care of business, but he would come back and lend an empathetic ear.  By the end of our meal, it felt like we had made a friend.  He went so above and beyond the call of duty in offering us customer service that I felt it needed to be recognized here.    The food itself was tasty.  I am vegan and was glad to find a place that catered to my needs with a minimum of special ordering.  It also happened to be one of the healthiest meals we had on this trip.  I would try to visit again if I ever return to Vegas, and its location on Fremont Street makes it convenient as a restaurant stop when gambling.",

Nicely browned fries and lots of brown gravy. But, something was off. Instead of big pieces of fresh cheese curd there were little cubes of some cheese. Not sure what kind and I didn't ask. A major disappointment. The fries themselves were really tasty. I'd forgo the poutine and just get plain fries.  The lamb shawarma pocket was just ok. The lamb was on the dry side and not overly flavorful, although in their defence when we asked what the best shawarma meat was they said chicken or beef.. The veggies were fresh as was the pita.",

I've been to Fremont Mediterranean Cafe before and wanted to bring her here.  She was up for a clean meal so this was a perfect match!  When you get into the cafe, it's exactly that.  A few tables, a long counter to order and a small seating area outside.  It's a nice, quaint size.  The staff is super friendly.  Our cashier initiated some conversation with us and made us feel welcome.    For dinner, I got the Turkey Avocado wrap for $8.95.  Pretty affordable, in fact all wraps are $8.95.  My wrap included a spinach tortilla, turkey breast, avocado, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers and a pesto spread.  I liked this combination a lot.  The mix of mild red onions and the tanginess of the banana peppers really makes the Mediterranean flavor.  They packed the wrap with turkey so it ended up being super filling.  Avocado and pesto brought the dish together.  It's a huge wrap and you will love it!  This place is exactly what they advertise:  Fresh, Natural and Healthy.  Ironically, it's located right next to the Heart Attack Grill.  Choose to be healthy and you will certainly love this place!  Come check them out.",

Looked at the specials in the window and decided $10 for a gyro and fries wasn't the  best deal but I was hungry.  I went in ordered but a not so smiley Jessica.  I went back to where my kids were sitting and decided I wanted to see if the had hummus on the menu and just then I heard Jessica Yelling at my kids \" NO DONT DO THAT\" as she comes running from behind the counter to grab the sugar packets out of there hands that they had taken out of the container.  I was completely embarrassed not of the fact that my children had moved the sugar packets out of the container but that this crazy lady is screaming and running toward us over SUGAR PACKETS!!! I immediately told her I would take it to go, I just wanted out of there.  By the time I got back to my car to eat my food the gyro was cold it had way to much sauce and there was oil dripping out the ptia from the \"meat\" I watched the cook pull from some rubber container from the fridge...The fries were ok but there were in the middle of switching brands of ketchup so I got a few Heinz packets and a few Sysco type brand...yuck! I will not be going back there and I hope that if this place wants to stay in business they will drop the dead weight!",

My salad was nothing like the menu description and came with--get this-- quartered BabyBel minis instead of goat cheese. I stated to the server, \"I thought this came with goat cheese,\" and he responded that it WAS goat cheese. Really dude? I mean, tell me you ran out. Tell me it was a mistake. Tell me pretty much ANYTHING, but don't lie to me. I know what freakin' goat cheese tastes like. My Mother had lamb that she said was incredibly tough. The hummus and baba ghanouj  were mediocre. Meh. It happens. Afterward, we were listening to a street musician a few yards from the door when the server ran out hollering about us not paying... except we did pay and had the receipt to prove it. I'm not outraged, the service was fairly friendly, but the food was a bummer and the fibbing waiter left me unwilling to spend my money at Couscous again.",

They also let us try some flavors of gelato and they were all amazing! My personal favorite was coconut.

The Fremont Mediterranean Cafe, located towards the end of the pedestrian-only part of Fremont Street near the Neonopolis Mall, was a welcome discovery during my recent visit to the city.  In fact, I would probably say that it was my all-around best dining experience in Vegas.  Towards the end of a long day walking, drinking, and gambling my way through downtown Las Vegas, I required sustenance-- and preferably something somewhat healthy, quick, and affordable.  Luckily I happened to stumble upon this place which fit the bill perfectly (and in stark contrast to the Heart Attack Grill, which is just a couple of doors down).    The falafel sandwich I ordered here was huge, delicious, and a great value at $6.  A mistake at the counter resulted in my sandwich being given to another customer, but the waitress was very apologetic and treated me to a free baklava for the additional wait.  Good stuff!  And really, having window seat facing out on Fremont Street was entertaining enough that I hardly noticed the time pass anyway :)",

Le Thai, Chicago Joe's, Rachael's and Eat., among others, were all closed. Casino restaurant takeout seemed odd, so I checked ye ole Yelp app for options and up came Freemont Mediterranean Cafe.    After ordering over the phone, I checked on the exact location and started on a trail of \"Oh sh*t\" statements.... \"Oh sh*t, it's IN the FSE\"  \"Oh sh*t, wtf is the Neonopolis?!\" \"Oh sh*t, I can't find it. Where is this place and why is the middle of Neonopolis a dead zone where no one can hear you scream?\" \"Found it! Oh sh*t, why is it empty?\" \"Oh sh*t, how is my order $28?\"  OK, enough with the cussing. The order was ready when I arrived (20 min after I called) and the staff was friendly. I rocked a chicken shawarma pita pocket and a large greek salad with gyro meat. The shawarma was solid: tender pieces of chicken in a not-to-thick tahini sauce and veggies in a pita. I crushed it in maaaaybe 4 minutes. The problem? It was $9. Ouch. $5 should be the price tag on this bad boy. Even the famous Mamoun's in NYC only charges $6. At $14, the salad was a bit much as well. The gyro meat was decent and plentiful, but the rest was an average greek salad. In my book, this meal wasn't worth the dough.",

Greek food isn't their focus, but what they have to offer isn't bad (gyros, wraps, falafels) small eating space, but the pricing isn't bad. Portioning is on styrofoam plates, but they try to fill it as best as they could. Personally I'd recommend a choice of the hot subs, or the gyros or wraps. The menu has a lot of variety, but any choice would be satisfying. Overall 3/5 stars, would come back again. (Update after eating) the meat was seasoned well, gyro falls apart at some points. And a major problem I had was that my girlfriend ordered the chicken gyro, but halfway through the meal she begins to find beef and lamb pieces. She doesn't eat red meats, so this was alarming. An issue is address from the beginning, to make sure no meats are crossing each other for future reference.",

Mediterranean restaurants should have good lamb right? But our lamb kabob was a bit dry. It comes with two kabob sticks which I shared one with one of my girl cousins and we were both still able to get full off of it. I tried a bite of the chicken chipotle wrap too and it wasn't too bad... But still not good enough for my cousin to to-go the second half after he finished the first half (the wrap is pretty big and comes in halves). Overall I've had better Mediterranean food elsewhere.",

The spinach pie and grape leaves looked good.  The lady behind the counter was friendly and quick.  1 gyro, 1 Greek salad and 2 bottled waters came to $22.  Portions weren't overly large for the price but it's located in a tourist part of town so nothing is going to be cheap.  The food was great so I'd definitely go back.",

    "text": "A quick, healthier option downtown is much appreciated! Granted, it might be a 3-star place if it weren't downtown and if they woman working the counter didn't have some fun, dry humor that we found entertaining. We came in a little tipsy, and I felt compelled to say, \"I promise we're not drunk tourists,\" and her reply was, \"Actually, locals give us the hardest time.\" Well played.   We ended up here because the wait was forever at Le Thai, and the hostess there did not appreciate our attempts at sneaking in the front door. We had to retreat quickly, and when we saw the sign that said \"Fresh and Healthy\" (or something like that), it was like an oasis.   Pro tip: The bathrooms have a code to enter, but even so, don't forget to manually lock the door like I did. Otherwise, you may have a visitor (like I did).  On to the food! They offer a vegetarian sampler plate which I love just in theory. I don't know why it's so hard to find in this town! It came with falafel, hummus, baba, a small salad and some pita. Everything tasted fresh. I wouldn't say the falafel were the best I ever had, but they were completely respectable!  The husband had the salmon skewers, and they looked super impressive. Huge chunks of fish, and the flavor was great as well. I had a little bite.   They sell wine in to-go cups! That feature may be worth a visit by itself.   If you're downtown, definitely worth a visit if you're hungry and need something quick!",

The mozzarella sticks did not come with marinara. We had to throw out our entire dinner. I will never order from them again.",

    "text": "Very dry and undercooked!   Came here on Sunday midday just before July 4th with my bf and his friend. My initial choice was going to try out the Heart Attack Grill (quite a infamous restaurant for healthwise) but the guys wanted to try out this Mediterranean cafe, which was literally next door.  The ambiance was pretty cosy, liked  the decorations around the restaurant. The menu was displayed upon entering the restaurant which was pretty good to see what you wanted.  I ordered the lamb shawarma my bf ordered the chicken shawarma and his friend ordered the chicken kabob. The waitress was kind and sweet, took our orders without a problem... then the problems came. We waited more than half n hour  for the chicken kabob, and another 15 minutes for the two shawarma's.   At start the friend says the kabob was good until he found an uncooked chicken. He later says that the parts that were cooked was over cooked and dry. The flavour was blah and it was bloody expensive for a chicken kabob.   My bf's chicken shawarma was horrible. The flavour was blah, the marinated chicken didn't contain flavour. The lettuce were black and un-fresh (even when they say \"always fresh\") the wrap was hard and cold. Even the Tahini sauce could not saved it.   They both left there dishes uneaten. They both walked out dissatisfied and disappointed.  On the other hand my lamb shawarma was equally the same as the chicken shawarma but instead of leaving it uneaten I decided to at least finished it all before walking out and never coming back to this restaurant.   Overall the restaurant was expensive, the waiting order was long, and the food isn't as great as what others say.   But hey if you want to try it, Goodluck and \"enjoy\"!",

Came here for lunch today and ordered the chicken gyro that came with fries. The meal was almost $10.00. I received a 10% discount because I work for one of the downtown properties. It was tasty and the fries were plenty! It definitely made me full. I thought it was a bit on the pricey side but I was still satisfied. I wish they offered shrimp or salmon gyro though. Because they don't i think I prefer Crazy Pita for my Mediterranean fix (it is also much closer to my house).  However if you are in the area and are looking for this type of meal, I definitely recommend giving them a try!",

As the waitress/cashier was closing down her drawer she told me (OH that's too bad)she says  You have to come back tomorrow to get your refund sorry.

She got the Fattouch salad with grilled shrimp & I got the chicken kabob plate.   YUM!!!     The prices aren't cheap, but the staff is very helpful.  I believe the owner & her Mom waited on us the first two times.  They were very sweet during our visits.  The salmon kabobs are AMAZING!!!  Actually, everything we tried was better than most places we've been to.  The tzatziki is creamy with chunks of cucumber, and the hummus tastes homemade.  Given that the heart attack grill is next door, this is the much better option.",

The Greek salad was excellent - the feta was superb quality and even the tomatoes were great! The chicken in the kebab was cooked to perfection with a crisp exterior. I was given the choice of couscous or rice and chose the former which had hearty grains and was very tasty. The pita was fresh and not greasy. I'll definitely be back or just have it delivered. So glad to have another good place to eat downtown!",

Unfortunately since originating management has left the place has rapidly gone down hill. My sandwiches are now about 1/2 the meat and less attention to quality as before and the prices have gone up. I sure they will make up in the transient crowds but its sad to see them squeeze every buck versus having consistency and quality. I just paid $7+ for a sandwich that should have cost about $4.50. I wish them luck,  they lost a local.",

I got the dolmades (canned but serve their purpose, wish they were homemade though), gyro meat (yum), and their awesome beet salad.  My mom got a turkey and avocado wrap, which she thought was great.  Their level of busy-ness is variable--we hit it while six or seven other parties were there, so we waited about 20 mins for our food.  You can't have the guy taking orders and working the cash register also running the food!  Also, for our meal, it was about $35, which was pretty pricey.  Still, I like the freshness of the food, I like the location, and I'll be back.",

The food was horribly......delicious! OMG, this was some bomb food. The pieces of meat on the kabobs were ginormous! I got one chicken and one steak and both were flavored very well and were juicy. Came with pita bread slices and also some couscous which was really tasty and plentiful. We both liked our food so much we came back the next day. I got the chicken wings and fries special. I asked and he said about 5-6 wings came with the order.....pretty sure there was 8. Pretty decent amount of food for $6.95. And besides the food being really good, the woman that runs the place, didn't catch her name, but skinny with a pixie hair cut and a tattoo going down her back, was very nice, very friendly and loved to engage all of her customers in some banter. When we left the first night I told her, \"I'd come back again for the food because it was great, but your personality is what seals the deal!\" Better than any chain Greek place....sorry Daphne's! If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular.",

Inside, they play nice music (Euro-pop?), not too loud. The food is excellent! It's almost all fresh-made from fresh (not frozen) food bought daily, according to the assistant manager, Josh. I would call this place fast-casual. You order at the counter, but they bring your food out to you on disposable dishes. The kabobs I ordered were delicious and the hummus was also! The pitas were the best I've ever tasted in a reasonably priced restaurant. Decor was decent, and the service was very good for a cafe of this type. I will definitely be back, and will recommend Cous Cous to anyone I know who likes Greek food and will be in downtown LV.",
