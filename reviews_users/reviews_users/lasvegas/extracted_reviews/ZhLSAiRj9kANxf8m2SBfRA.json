    "text": "To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.  I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.  I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.    Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.     The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.  I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?  But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.",

The yellow curry was VERY tasty. I specifically avoided the shrimp based on a previous review about the amount of actual shrimp included, and I'm happy to say that the chicken option is definitely full of chicken! And potatoes. Honestly, I was surprised at how much food it was for ten bucks.   The level 3 was a good call for me since I love spicy flavors, but the actual heat not so much. I would probably try a 2 next time.",

The reason I'm giving three stars is because I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and although the broth was DELICIOUS, it only came with three little shrimp and a couple mushrooms and at $6.95 for a pint (16 oz.), what a rip off.   I added thin sliced red bell peppers, fresh spinach, cubed tomatoes and cilantro and it was delicious, but I shouldn't have to do that...and I know most y'all muhfuckers don't have that in your fridge, which is why you tryna order food, nah'm sayin'?   A 32 ounce would have been $12.95 and unless the broth would've been made from Beyonce's sweat...nope.  Yummy grill sushi by my house has a 32 ounce soup for the same price and it is filled with shrimp, wontons, chicken, broccoli, bok choy, carrots...every time.  Aside from the skimpy skrimpys, will def be ordering again!",

We usually get green chicken curry and pad see ew noodles with chicken. Can't go wrong with that, but for our latest visit we ordered curry rice and pad Thai. Throwing off the shackles of routine, and breaking out of our food rut!   Not really, I'm joking. Worked out really well, since we're looking for something a bit lighter than our usual. We ended the night with fried bananas and green tea ice cream - even though we were stuffed. The portion size was a little smaller than we expected, and my wife wasn't a fan of the tiny bit of cream cheese added inside, but like I said I don't think we could've handled much more anyway. There's more than just vanilla ice cream available to go along with it, we got green tea ice cream, so that was a plus.   Anyway, we've been coming here for awhile, but I just wanted to share. If you're in the mood for Thai food, but just not sure what to order. Or maybe you want to try something new. The service is fast, and the people here are open and friendly.",

It smelled good but the broccoli beef was salty and the beef was super tough. The broccoli was chewy too. The wonton soup was really garlicky but I really didn't have such a hard time with that because I like garlic but it was still a bit much and I understand how someone else would have a problem with that. The white rice was ok. The Pad Thai was good. Overall it seemed like it was food made from the morning and not fresh. I really wanted to like it since it's so close to my house but I would rather go farther for better food.",

Whether I'm dining in or picking up, they are always super fast and always deliver on quality and freshness. I think one of the best things about this place is their customer service. They're all really friendly and attentive here.   They also have big portions for really affordable prices. Two entrees usually totals to about $20, enough for two to share and then some. My favorites are the red curry with tofu and the Tom kha with extra mushrooms. (Lately, they've been chopping up the lemongrass small so you have to spit it out as you eat or maneuver around it which is annoying, but I digress.)  Regardless, I love the food here and their abundant vegan and vegetarian options. Definitely recommend this place! ~",

The stew broth (like Pho) favor had me wishing it would never end, so I only ate half of it to enjoy the rest the next day. Same with the Pad Thai, the flavor and perfect moisture content makes me say here and now, it is the best Pad Thai I've ever had in Vegas....anywhere. Guest with me had different kinds of fried rice and they were also amazing. Not a very large place and has limited seating but once you are at a table, the service and friendliness is second to none. A little bit of a drive for me but that wont keep me from going back again and again.",

And if u know anything about me is that I hate driving.... But I love Thai food and even though I have great restaurants near my house I'm always in the search for new places to eat.   Service was 5/5....I was greeted right away and the young girls working the restaurant were super friendly and were totally on top of things. Great service with a smile!!  That was their saving grace on this trip.   I got their lunch special which was a decent deal.  Soup.... Salad.... Egg roll... Fried tofu pad Thai. Now let me break it down. Egg drop soup.... Looked good... But tasted like raw garlic. I LOVE garlic but not when all I could taste in the soup was raw garlic....(2.5/5).  You can't really mess up an egg roll can u? (5/5) Salad was served with a ginger dressing... Very fresh and tangy (5/5). Fried tofu pad Thai. What a disappointment. :( :( :( :(  it was soooooo sweet! Too much sugar. Not enough tamarind to offset that sweetness.  It just did not taste like Pad Thai....i wanted that sweet, sour salty flavor combination. (3/5) and overall it was another -1 star cuz I asked for level 10 spice and they have me a 2.... It was NOT spicy at all. Maybe they thought that I couldn't handle it?? Boo!! :(  I also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. I love love chicken lettuce wraps.  BUT these were overly salty. All i could taste was soy sauce.  BUT I did love the Roman lettuce vs the traditional iceberg lettuce. So props to them for the change. (3.5/5)  Overall.... If I'm in the area... I might stop by but with so many better Thai choices in Vegas...I don't think that it'll be very likely.",

    "text": "I came here for a birthday dinner with my friend. It's not a big restaurant, so there are only so many seats for dining in. The restaurant is quite nice-looking though. The menu is just one page, so not actually as extensive as most other Thai places I've been to.  Service here is EXTREMELY attentive and friendly. They really take great strides in serving you, you will know what I mean if you dine here. Another party had a birthday during our meal, and I didn't want to mention that it was my birthday, but when we were jokingly asked I responded affirmatively. Thus, my honey toast dessert came with three candles.  For my main course, I ordered basil duck off the specials board. While the flavor was good, there was not much meat at all, mostly just skin and fat. I understand that duck is a more expensive ingredient, but when they upcharge that much for duck entrees (most other dishes were $10 and under, but duck and seafood are $14+), I expect a little more substance. My friend's eggplant and tofu dish was better in my opinion. At least they don't charge extra for rice.  The honey toast for dessert was not that spectacular, it just came with toast and ice cream. It's hard to compare when I've had such elaborate honey toast in Taiwan; I mainly ordered it at Lucki Thai just to serve as my \"birthday cake.\"  Overall, a decent Thai restaurant with very friendly service.  P.S. They have a spicy range of 1-10 for all of their dishes. I ordered 5 and it barely registered for me. Thai spice can get pretty hot though, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend 10, but as a medium-spice tolerant individual, I will say that 5 here is not all that spicy.",

The most important part about Lucki is that they consistently get the flavors right, and to me that's the most important part about Thai food.   The papaya salad with sticky rice, pad se ewe, pineapple fried rice, spicy basil dishes, and red/green/panang curries are all winners in my book.  If I'm being a stickler, I think their meat quality could be better and more consistent, and when I dine-in here I sometimes feel like I'm getting overserved - but the reality is that the staff have always been friendly and make me feel like they are trying their best.  Bottom line, it's really nice having an option closer to Henderson so that we don't always have to drive up to the typical well-known Thai spots in Chinatown (or further) to get our fix.",

The only thing is the size of the place is a little small so if it is busy, prepar to wait. We stopped in here by chance waiting on a family member to arrive on a delayed flight.",

Period.  I ordered a coconut water, yellow curry, papaya salad, pad see ew and the mouthgasmic- mango sticky rice!! It was more than enough for us, we had to get boxes home. Looking forward to enjoy this food tomorrow   I'm a Vegas local, so even happier I found my go-to Thai place",

The Tom kah soup was good and something we would recommend. The pad sea ew, however, was way too salty. And when I say too salty it is no exaggeration. The restaurant booths and tables are old and show major signs of wear, but the establishment looks clean, which is what really matters! The pricing is great and very reasonable. Lastly, the staff was very friendly and sweet. Wouldn't be in a rush to come back here and overall it was an average experience",

Every time I asked a question about a dish, she would let out a sigh and her voice was so condescending! I've never had this type of treatment while ordering takeout.   My boyfriend went to pick up the food when he got home, everything was greasy and tasted like fish sauce. Look I don't mind fish sauce to enhance the flavors but let's not pour a gallon on each dish and call it a day. Thai food is suppose to be flavorful not salty and fishy tasting. We could not even finish our curry & pad thai. Yuck!   I think I'm in a go back to ordering from Thai House down the street where the customer service is 1000 times more friendlier & food not so greasy and salty. Sorry but I'm taking my business and hard earned cash somewhere else much more deserving.",

However, they are nice enough to redeliver the soup and tea in 3 different times. Literally the delivery  boy have to keep coming back 3x because of their negligence. Whoever is checking the food that goes out for delivery needs to be trained a little bit more. Take a note I ordered my food at 1107. They just opened so it shouldn't be that busy already.   Food wise no doubt it's a good thai place and they deserve a 4 stars in regards to food. I ordered  a Tom GA, spicy basil chicken fried rice and chicken tofu pad see eew. The spice level is on point. I like mine medium heat it just gives  a little kick but still taste all the flavors.   Would I order from them again mostly likely NO. But I wouldn't mine  sitting down for any meals.  Also there's a $3.00 delivery charge.",

Though it is a small restaurant and was packed, there were many takeout orders. We had fried tofu for appetizers, which was yummy, but I'd prefer they were cut smaller so they're crispier. We had fried whole pompano fish with fresh ginger sauce and pumpkin curry (chicken and tofu) with steamed rice included, which I highly recommend both dishes. They were both large portions and just right for the price. The fish was so crispy and curry was so flavorful. I'm so glad I found a spot to satisfy my Thai cravings.",

Let me start off by mentioning that the staff is very friendly! They will greet you whenever you come in and whenever you leave! Not a whole lot of restaurants do that now a days so it's nice when they acknowledge your presence! Keep it up!  We've had the garlic chicken numerous times and we also had dishes such as: beef and broccoli, orange chicken, and some lemon based chicken dish. All dishes were delicious and are made to order so it comes out hot and fresh every time! You can also add the level of spicy-ness that you prefer to most dishes. The Thai iced tea is also a good refreshing drink after your meal!  The prices are fairly reasonable , about 9-10 dollars per dish, but the dishes are very large in portions, so expect to have leftovers for tomorrow! The atmosphere is also very quiet and the environment is very clean and presentable. The only thing negative I could say about the place is that sometimes the rice is sometimes really dry, but that could be easily fixed, add more water!   Overall, really great experience with this business, the management is doing a good job. Keep it up!",

I came to yelp to help me with a reasonable lunch option that delivers that's how I found this place.  I almost placed my delivery order via yelp but I saw photos of lunch specials and I didn't see the lunch specials online so I called the place up and inquired about lunch specials delivery.  The woman informed me that the lunch specials aren't available for delivery online however she can place my order over the phone.  Hooorah! I ordered the red curry chicken (comes with white rice) lunch special (spicy 7) and a chicken fried rice.   All of the lunch specials come with a little salad, fried veggie spring roll, fried wonton, and veggie soup.  Each lunch special I ordered was only $7.95 + $4 delivery fee.    After completing my order I was told it would arrive in 15 minutes! Whoa! But if I ordered online it would've been 45-50 minutes! My food arrived deliciously hot in 14 minutes! I live about 3 miles from the restaurant.  For the amount of money, the service, the quality and quantity I must say you get your bucks worth ordering from here!

We like it spicy, 8-10 gets the job done. I've been less pleased by the Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao. Not that either have been prepared poorly, it's just I have other places that I prefer. The pad thai noodles were more thin than I like. I found the chicken in the Pad Kee Mao a bit bland, and the portion of noodles to the rest of its parts was a bit weak.  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to try more of the menu. It's great having Thai take out so close to home.",

We got a five and six spicy but will probably order higher next time but the lady gave extra chili so it worked out perfectly. The beef jerky was really tender and the crab rangoons were delish. Long story short ALL of the 4 things were very tasty and full of flavor. This is by far the best thai food around (ive eaten a lot of thai food too)and can't beat the prices too! $35 for everything. Will definitely be bl going back",

For starters we showed up close to their closing time... Which I understand (worked in restaurants before) can be an inconvenient time for cooks, servers, etc.  I normally try to avoid these times.  Anyway... These guys still gave us an amazing dinner despite our late timing. Ordered the beef jerky appetizer, crab fried rice (could use more crab but still good), red curry with pork and the fried Bananna for dessert.  Love to support family run businesses and pretty sure I saw a mother in the kitchen so you know this place is legit!  Will be back for sure!",

I give this place 5 stars because the Thai food is that good.  I am a huge fan of curries, and theirs is the best.  Great portions, they use quality ingredients, and their flavors are unrivaled.  This is the best value and best flavor I have had at ANY restaurant in Las Vegas.  BTW - they have other menu items that are on the \"asian cuisine\" side, that I have not tried. I have stuck to their authentic Thai menu. Excellent.  This is a very small place, with limited seating. I have managed to get a table each time I have been and the service is excellent, but I am guessing the majority of their business is take-out.  I have seen orders flying out of there each time I have been.",

I usually stick to the classics when I eat at a new Thai place... we ordered the Pad Thai, Pad See Ewe, Tom Ka Gha, and a Chicken Panang dish.  I really like that when I asked for spicy, they gave me spicy!   Everything was fresh and good.  The fried rice with salmon looked good, but we didn't order it on this round. Probably a next time proposition.  Considering this is effectively a strip mall joint, we were pleasantly surprised, and it lived up to the Yelp reviews.  Note that this is a ways off the freeway... farther than you probably thought it was going to be.  Don't worry-- there's pretty much one way in and one way back to the I-15, so don't settle for stateline jerky, Turkey!  Get something that will stick to your ribs through at least Barstow on the way home.  After all, you'll be sitting in that godforsaken traffic anyway, so why not make a day of it?",

First off it's kind of in the back of a big old parking lot and as I was not a local it took me a little while to find it, but it was really worth it. It's not to fancy inside, and there are lots of people getting to go orders, a constant flow in and out. me I sat down for dinner I have some potstickers and kung pao chicken. I was really happy with the pot stickers as they were the right thickness of skins that weren't so thick that it was all pasta for whatever they make them out of. All I know is I was happy and a little soy and a little chili paste and yum yum yum. the Kung Pow was just fine I was happy with the recipe and the presentation, I just wish I had three or four people with me so I can order a bunch of things and try them all. Just one person for dinner at a Chinese restaurant well bummer, but I would return the this place again and again. They were nice the service was as prompt as you can request and I was really happy with the food. Let's go to Vegas what do you say?",

    "text": "I had this location bookmarked, and I am so glad that I did. Last Sunday Thai food just sounded so good.   The moment we walked in the door, we were greeted by everyone working there. Everyone was extremely friendly and polite. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai, and Beef See Ew. They can make the food 'spicy' on a scale from 1 to 10. I am still not up to the level that my husband is, but decided to be brave and go with a '7' for spiciness.   The food came out quickly, and it looked and smelled wonderful. The portions were generous. One of my favorite parts to the Pad Thai are the bean sprouts, and these were very fresh and flavorful. They were also nice and cold. For my husband, we asked for chili oil, and got a side of it as well as sliced peppers. Of course, he used these generously on his food. For me though, the food was spicy. The spice also crept on us as well. So by the end, I had to slow down and was drinking a bit more between bites to keep the heat at bay. We had to stop ourselves though, as the food was wonderful and we were really stuffed. We ended up having another meal to take home with us as leftovers.   We will most definitely be back, as the service and food are both excellent.",

    "text": "I know this wordplay is too obvious, but I have to use it: Silverado Ranch residents are \"lucki\" to have this restaurant in their neighborhood.  Lucki Thai is another Thai restaurant in a city chock full of them, and perhaps that saturation as well as this place's slightly off the beaten path location (Southeast corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda) dissuaded me from trying them. We all have our favorites that are closer to home and/or more familiar, don't we? But since I was in the area and my friend had said it was pretty good, I decided to stop by.  The dining room is on the small side, but there were plenty of tables open at 8-ish. The lighting in the evening appeared a little dim, but I was able to get decent food photos anyway. My mom, who is familiar with the Thai language due to her studying/travels, pointed out that the employees are indeed Thai, so that was a pretty good sign. The menu looks fairly standard, and we each picked out a dish.  Pad See Ew with beef ($8.95): I chose this because it's one of my favorite noodle dishes. Almost everything was awesome: luscious noodles, plentiful thinly sliced beef, somewhat bitter and crunchy Chinese broccoli, delicious sauce, and appropriately spicy for 3 out of 10. I did find the beef to be a little too chewy, especially with one or two pieces that still had long stringy fibers. But for the price, you can't expect the moon. I highly recommend this dish.  Papaya Salad with BBQ Chicken and Sticky RIce ($10.95): my mom wanted this dish. We immediately noticed that it wasn't anywhere near 3 out of 10 in heat, but this wasn't so bad because I'd asked for additional spicy condiments on the side. The papaya salad was on the tart side and had plenty of peanuts (allergy sufferers beware. The chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and using the sweet sauce helped to counter the sour salad. However, I really didn't appreciate that the sticky rice felt pretty hard and got even harder as it cooled down.  I'll make an effort to come back to Lucki Thai. The other noodle dishes should be similarly great, and I've gotta try the curries because of Marie T's recommendation.",

If you're looking for a very laid back, chill atmosphere and nothing fancy but good food, large portions and serviceable staff...this is the place to be. However, if you're looking for fancy, Thai dining to impress someone or have an upscale and trendy lunch or dinner for Thai, then visit lotus of Siam (be sure to get the fried prawns)!!  I'll visit this place again!",

Let me start by saying this place is very nice inside and the staff is all super friendly which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.   As always when I'm at a new Thai place, I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai and a soup.  I do this cuz pad Thai is hard to f#$% up to a point that is not edible.  Their pad Thai was super saucy and really salty which was strange.  I also got the wonton soup which was also a bit salty, but not nearly as bad as the pad thai.  I had high hopes for this place since there seemed to be good reviews, but in all likelyhood I will not be coming back.  All in all it was not horrible, but I'll try other places in the area based off this experience.",

When we told her that we were not happy with the food, she was pissed off and she started yelling \"Thai food is sweet okay\". We then asked her if there's anything that is not sweet, she recommended the wanton soup. We went ahead and ordered it as we were pretty hungry by then. Guess what? The wanton soup was sweet too. Also, we found a piece of beef on our red chicken curry. We are hindus and we don't eat beef and that was quite a disappointment.",

We accidentally stumbled upon this place while looking to see if Lotus of Siam or Nataya's secret kitchen were open.  We were sad they were not, but I can't say enough good things about this place.  Service was amazing, but the food was unreal. We got the chicken salad to start - talk about flavor!! Next was the chicken Satay- and unreal how awesome this tasted.  We then moved on to the Tom Kha soup - my favorite Thai dish - the flavor and freshness was out of this world.    If I could give this place 6*'s I would.  Needless to say this is now our official goto Thai destination.",

Called 8 minutes and walked in and my food was ready. The portion sizes are huge, even for me.

When I tried to place my order the English was very bad and I am not knocking the person for that it's just that I was sick and it's hard to repeat yourself and the order taker said my card was declined and I had to hang up and call my bank and yes it was Lucky Thai mistake I had money available for the order so I called back and re ordered my re order. When the delivery person came she couldn't find my apt so my sick arse had to go all the way outside to meet her. I was so excited for my food and it was not like it usually is, saggy lettuce for chicken wrap. The won ton soup was nasty. I tried to call this evening and they put me in la la land so I stopped in to tell the manager who wasn't there what happens. Buy the way the person I told my story too said \"you don't order here that much\" ? Ok what is the point I order from them when I  Sick. So the manager who was not there suddenly appears out of the back I explained the story he told me to bring the food back. I throw it in the trash homie! He told me he is running a small business and it's hard. I didn't expect a full refund I did tell him I loved the honey toast. But the service and other food items were bad. He refused to do anything for me I asked for my $3.00 delivery charge back since I had to help the delivery driver out. Even if he didn't give my all of the money he could and should have offered me something other than a lame excuse. I am a regular and I had a bad experience and you didn't care to turn it around. So thank you! Hey this is Vegas right?! Suck it up butter cup!!",

    "text": "DELICIOUS. I still remember the day they built Lucki Thai. It looked like another generic thai/Asian food place. Honestly it looked like it would go out of business within a few months. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try anyway because their food is absolutely delicious.  Nowadays the place looks packed and gets a lot of business,  and I'm glad. I personally go there for the Beef Pad Si Iew. I think it is extraordinary. I also enjoy the lettuce wrap, the chow mein, and their fried rice. Their fried chicken isnt bad either. The spice levels used to be weak when they opened shop. I would order beef pad si iew with spice level 10, and it would be a little spicy. Nowadays, I start sweating at spice level 7. I even gave the new spice level 10 a try, and it was painfully delicious.  I was sweating, tongue was numb, I went through at least 20 cups of water (and they made sure my cup stayed full without me asking). It's a great convenient place to grab some delicious tai food. I happen to live nearby it,  so if it weren't for Lucki tai, I'd still be driving all the way to china town for some good Asian food. I'd recommend this place to anyone all day.",

    "text": "We recently moved back to Las Vegas and were spoiled in Minnesota by good Thai food. So the search was on. We walked into the restaurant on a Friday night and surprisingly we were the only people dining inside the restaurant. This was a little peculiar on a Friday and then people started pouring in. They didn't sit down to down; they were getting their takeout orders. A lot of customers do take out here. My wife and I ordered our usual favorites which are beef pad see eew and chicken green curry with 7 on the spice scale. We also ordered the Lucky Thai fried rice for our son with no spice. The 7 spice scale was hot but not as hot as I thought it'd be. (My wife and I actually were married in Thailand so we know how hot Thai food can get.) But everything was delicious, the portions were huge, and the prices were very reasonable. The entire staff was very friendly and prompt. This is now my go to place for Thai food here in Vegas.",

We were seated but not provided with menus until I asked. Which was weird because the norm is to receive menus upon being seated. No big deal - just wanted to put it out there.  We ordered beef pad Thai with level 6 spiceness. The spice tasted more like an 8. It was spicy AF. We ordered Mongolian beef spice level 3. This did not taste spicy at all so idk how level 6 was severe. We also order Thai beef Jerky, Lucki wings, crab fried rice, and some pot stickers. Jerky was good. Wings were aiight. Crab fried rice was bomb. Pot stickers were ok. Mongolian beef was good. Pad Thai was, probably good but I gave up after a few bites lol.   Will definitely come back. Maybe to order for pick-up especially if there is ever a wait here.",

We ordered the pad see ew with tofu & vegetables and panang curry with chicken, both spice level 3/10. The pad see eww is one of the best I've tasted before. It had lots of flavor, vegetables weren't too soft or over cooked, and the noodles were thin so you could possibly eat all of it in one sitting! The vegetables inside was asparagus, which I thought is an interesting choice. But it's cut up so small you wouldn't be able to tell what it is until you eat it. We also got the panang curry with chicken, also very tasty! It came with a side of rice, but tasted even better on the noodles. Both of these dishes were 3/10 spicy which I didn't think was spicy at all.  Service was awesome, servers were very attentive and always refilling our waters every time we took a drink!   I will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu, maybe even kick up the spice levels too!",

There's no doubt about that, but there were two occasions where my order came so much later than my friends' orders. One time I can forgive, but two times, really? It feels like they had a vendetta against me, but I probably just had bad luck.   You guys are lucki (ha, get it?) that I'm still giving you 4 stars. Your food is way too good to pass up. Not only is the chicken Pad Thai delicious, but the Pad see ew is such an incredible dish as well. Other dishes I would recommend would be the spicy basil chicken, the papaya salad, and their Lucki wings.   Hopefully next time I won't be forgotten during lunch. Third time's the charm.",

So far I have had the red curry, pineapple curry, jungle curry, and Panang curry. Overall I think the red curry is my favorite. It's the perfect balance of sweet, creamy, and spicy.  I always order it to go and it travels well. It also makes a fantastic leftover lunch the next day. Another noteworthy mention is their mango sticky rice. It's so so good! you absolutely must try it.",

Some of my favorite things to order are the Pad See Ew, Tom Kah, Crab Rangoons, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the Chicken Panang. I'm sure there are more amazing things on the menu. I just happen to fall in love with certain entrees and can't seem to order anything else.    The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality is awesome AND the portions are larger than most Thai restaurants. Usually I find myself not having any leftovers at most places, but here I can always bring home a bunch and let it feed me for a few days.   Servie is quick and friendly. My one criticism is something they cannot change. The place is small and busy. So sometimes you may have to order take out rather than eat in. But who cares! As long a I get to stick my face in some Thai food, I don't care where I do it.   Happy to see some yummy, locally owned and operated, Thai food in this area.",

My personal favorites and recommendations are:   Noodle Dishes - Pad See Ewe - Pad Kee Mao - Pad Thai (Chicken or Beef for protein)  Curries - Chicken Panang - Red Curry (All incredibly flavorful curries)  Soups - Tom Yum - Wonton  (Tom Yum is great for an app and Wonton is deliciously hearty)  Spice levels are typical for Thai restaurants between 1 - 10 so please be conservative with your spiciness.  Besides the food, every other reason check out Lucki Thai: - Service is over the top friendly - Take out is fast and easy - They deliver! - Inside is clean and inviting  - Open late (10 PM) - It's a hole in the wall that you wouldn't think serves alcohol... but they do!  Love Lucki Thai! Great take out or dine in Thai place for those who live close to Silverado and Bermuda.",

The reason I only gave them 3 stars is because the restaurant itself is very very tiny so makes it hard to move around if youre dining in or just picking up an order. Also, I've tried their yellow curry and also a shrimp dish and both were just \"ok\". The portions weren't very large by comparison to some of the other places in the area and the flavor just wasnt there. Maybe I'm eating the wrong dishes, but I would be willing to give them another shot when im craving Thai.",

We ordered: Tom yum soup, pineapple curry with steamed tofu, wonton soup with egg noodles and vegetable basil fried rice. I usually order the spiciest when I eat thai food but their #10 is no joke! I loved it but unfortunately it was almost inedible for my husband. One thing that was an absolute plus for me was that the soups and curry were still piping hot. There's nothing more unpleasant than to have your food be cold by the time it gets delivered. Everything was delicious but I wasn't too pleased with the vegetable basil fried rice. I've had better at other restaurants but it doesn't really matter because it isn't a dish I get often. Our entire order came out to around $40 (love it). Only bad thing I can say is that it was weird to not get utensils and napkin with a delivery order. and the rice tasted like it wasn't fresh and had been microwaved real quick. Customer service seems great so far. The man who answered the phone and took my order spoke clear English and he was very nice. Like I said, Lucky Thai is my new go to thai restaurant from now on.",

I could go on and on.  I haven't had a dish I did not love!  Their service is excellent. The restaurant is small, clean, and a friendly atmosphere.   It's  my go to for delivery also. Beats out pizza every time. Anytime I have visitors this is a must have, and they are never disappointed. I recommend Lucki Thai to all of my friends and family. Now it's their favorite place.

The waitstaff really know the menu and they are great with the customers, including my friends that aren't experienced with Thai food.  In fact, I came here with a friend who can't stand the smell of curry. But I love this little place so much I have to give it five stars, a rank I rarely give restaurants.",

Rich flavors, noodles cooked to perfection, just enough spice! And they put the bean sprouts and peanuts on the side which I feel is thoughtful! I also had the chicken satay and it was AMAZING!!! The sauce for the chicken satay has a flavor that is great! It's not your typical peanut sauce. It almost has a curry taste to it also, which I love!!! The chicken pieces are not all huge and fatty! They are the perfect size and portion and the chicken was very tender. I ordered the Shrimp fried rice as well and used some of my sauce from my chicken satay on my rice and it was GREAT!!! I also had the shrimp tempura and crab Rangoon appetizer. The shrimp tempura is some of the best I've ever had especially because of the sauce they give you to dip it in. It reminds me of a spicy mayo. The crab Rangoon's were good but just smaller than I'm used to. My recommendation is, if you see the menu and something sounds good for Lucki Thai, then GET IT because it is probably AMAZING!!!",

Found this place by accident when I was directed by Yelp to a restaurant next door that was closed on Sunday. What great fortune. This place is thee bomb. So delicious. So flavorful. So yummy. This is a bit away from the strip but it will be my go to place to go when I'm in Vegas and want to eat an affordable delicious meal. On the strip the meal my wife and I ordered of pad Thai, crab rice, egg rolls, cashew shrimp, Thai tea would have been over 150 bucks in sure. Here it was closer to 40. Was amazing. Don't hesitate to eat here! Also it's a cute well decorated restaurant. Very clean. Even the bathrooms.",

    "text": "My family and I came here for Father's Day and we were seated right away (automatic plus). There was only one other table so they were not busy at all which is why I don't understand why the waitress was rushing to get our order. After being told we needed more time, she came back only two minutes later to ask if we were ready. Needless to say, it was a bit annoying. We decided on Crispy Pork with Spicy Basil sauce, Tom Kha with seafood, Chicken Pad Thai, and Red Curry with beef. The food came out quickly enough and we dug in right away.   The Crispy Pork with Basil sauce was very tasty but had very little pork in it. It was mostly asparagus, basil leaves, and bell pepper. The porj wasn't very tender either.   Tom Kha with seafood was delicious but not worth the $15. It only had one piece of shrimp, 1 mussel, a couple pieces of squid, and little bits of chopped fish. I would order it again but maybe with chicken. Very rich flavor with a hint of curry and coconut milk.  Chicken Pad Thai was a bit too sweet for my liking. Again, they were very stingy with the meat. I didn't feel like it had enough of the peanut taste.  The Red Curry with beef was very savory. I could eat just the sauce with rice and I did end up having too as it only had a few pieces of beef floating in the soup with countless bamboo pieces.   We decided to order the sticky rice with mango. The waitress was excited to tell us that the mangos were very ripe. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed when the order came. The sticky rice was delicious but the mangos were nowhere near ripe. They looked ripe but they were extremely sour and when we flipped it over there were dark spots all over the middle of it.   Overall, the food was ok and at first glance you will think there's a lot of food. However, they're very stingy with the meat. I understand that it's a business but people will not come back if they feel like they're not getting their money's worth either.",

We try to stay away from the larger hotels for the most part and try to focus on the hidden gems of Vegas. Starving after a day of swimming, I decided to use my old faithful, Yelp, to give me a good recommendation for a Thai restaurant and it did just that. We came in around 6 and it was a little busy but not so much yet. We did have to wait because we had a party of 8 and the restaurant has very limited seating. The gentleman at the front was very friendly and promised to grab us outside when the table was ready and even started taking our orders so our wait was minimized. Who goes above and beyond to even do that? Such a blessing when you have 4 little rowdy boys with you! Awesome! We decided on the Pad Thai, Pad See Ewe, Mongolian Beef, The Lucki Thai Fried Rice, the Lucki Wings, and the Kung Pao Shrimp and Chicken. Everything came out pretty quickly upon seating. The food was amazing. The noodles tasted like they were just prepared that day and the flavor notes were on point! I honestly probably saw, while sitting there eating, about 12 groups of people who ended up leaving because the line was so long. Yes! The food is that good! The owner, who ended up being the gentleman who took our order, was super friendly. I'm definitely making my way back here when we come back in July! A must go!",

My wife and I ordered the egg rolls and two entrees. Her entree showed up really quickly. Egg rolls next, then my entree. Oddly large time gaps between.

We've been to South Point more and more lately and wanted to find a new Thai place to try out in the area. After checking on our trusty Yelp! app., we found this place!  Items Ordered:  - Chicken Pad See Ewe ($8.95) - Pork Laab (I guess I've been misspelling this \"Larb\" recently...oops, my bad) ($8.95) - Side order of jasmine rice ($1.50)  (+) Very friendly and attentive service! Never had to see our drinks empty the entire time we were there!  Chicken Pad See Ewe (4/5) For the price, a very solid portion that was very tasty. Plenty of chicken too!  Jasmine Rice (3.5/5) Kind of hard to mess this up, but they did good! Rice was the perfect combination of sticky and fluffy.  Pork Laab (5/5) Best Laab I've had in this country! Seriously, prepared exactly how I love it! Plentiful portion as well! I will be ordering this dish often!  (-) Only complaints with this place was that the seat was wet when I sat down today and there were a couple small, dried food fragments on one of the plates already at the table when we sat down. I just decided to not use that plate, but still not something you wish to see when you are just sitting down at a dining establishment.  I like this little place a lot! The people are nice and the food is really good and all that at an affordable price! With our recent patronage at South Point, I can see myself coming back here again and again!  4 stars.",

We ordered the small Tom Kha Shrimp soup, the Spicy Eggplant with Chicken, the Chicken Panang Curry and the Pad Thai with Chicken.  SO. MUCH. FOOD!    Because we don't really know how spicy things are here.... we ordered everything as a #2 (out of 10.)  I always err on the side of caution until I get a feel for a place.    Anyways.... flavors were so good.  I wanted to lick my curry dish, but I was too full.  I took 1/2 of my curry dish home for dinner tomorrow night.  Mom took home 1/2 the pad thai and 1/2 of the spicy eggplant which should be enough for 2 more meals for her.  I really liked the soup.... it was creamy but not overly so.  The creaminess did not coat my mouth like some thai soups do.  The soup was not heavy and had lots of veggies in it like mushrooms and tomatoes as well as plump, succulent shrimp.  For all the food we ordered plus 2 hot jasmine teas... the bill was $38.  Personally, I think that's a really good deal since Mom and I have food for the next day too.  We will be back!  Next time we will order more judiciously (maybe.)",

It was the first time for three of us and we were told by our friend, who frequents this restaurant, how wonderful it is! We sit down, order our food and wait. And wait. It took 40 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged we hadn't gotten our food yet and said she was sorry and it would be out in two minutes. We wait. And wait. By this time at least 3 tables had gotten their food who had been seated long after us and not to mention the handfuls of people who had come in to get their to go orders. It had been an hour and ten minutes, from the time we got there before we had gotten our fourth and final dish. All we kept getting was sorry. When we asked for the manager either they didn't have anyone in charge or they were too uninterested in coming to speak to us. Finally when one of us asked for the owners name and phone number, the waitress said \"well maybe I can call him first.\" All of a sudden not even a minute later the whole meal was on them.   They did redeem themselves ultimately but nobody could ever explain what happened when asked. Too bad the food is good but due to the lackluster service it made for a horrible first experience and we will not be returning.",

Some dishes were very good(spicy eggplant, noodles) Panang curry tasted more like peanut sauce than a rich and creamy coconut base.    I would have given it 3.5 if I could.  It got 4 for service",

All the others that work here are super friendly too. Their red curry (with tofu) is by far my favorite although I've tried several others on the menu and like them too.

The spice levels were off too. I got a five on a scale of 1-10 and it taste like a 1. My boyfriend for a 3 and his taste like a 6. Thai House and Pin Kaow pad thai dish had more flavor. Thai House and Pin Kaow red curry has more and better vegetable selections in them. The staff was attentive which is one star. The price is right which is the other star.

You can tell this is a family owned place because everyone is happy to greet you when you walk in, and excited to check in with you to make sure the meal is to your liking. We ordered the curry rice, curry salmon, and pad thai and every dish was A M A Z I N G. They were even very accommodating in making the dishes not spicy (as best as they could) and recommended some appetizers for us to have. I can honestly say every bite was an explosion of flavor that kept us eating more and more!  If you are reading this review, it's because you are looking for a good place for a good meal.

The food was really good-- I'm always hesitant to order Pad Thai as so many places make it sickeningly sweet and the flavor gets tiresome after a few bites. My struggle with their Pad Thai is that I hope to save some for later, but end up eating the whole bowl. It's a calorific punch that is worth the food coma. Their chicken wings are so fresh and crispy-- it's mind boggingly good.",

    "text": "Respect! I honestly live in a desert. No, not Henderson NV, but Gainesville GA. Not a desert absent of rain/moisture, but a desert absent of good restaurants...a so-called 'food desert.' Never has that become clearer than on my recent trip to Henderson where I ordered take-out from Lucky Thai from my hotel (Hampton Inn on Saint Rose). The person that answered the phone at Lucky Thai had a thick Thai accent, that obviously bodes well for the authenticity of the food. I ordered the Spicy Basil Chicken and he asked 'how hot would you like it 1 to 10?' I said 4. I also got 4 of what they call egg rolls (but I'd call spring rolls since the skins is crisp and thin). My entree arrive in typical white styrofoam to-go boxes.  However, they lined the bottom with a thin sheet of aluminum foil which allowed them to include all the WONDERFUL sauce!  OMG. Why doesn't every restaurant do this. The food tasted like the chef cared about my meal. The spiciest was perfect for me, although if you're a wimp I'd suggest 2 or 3. There were huge fully formed branches of FRESH basil! Did you know that truly healthy basil has vibrant purple stems?  Me either until I ate this dish. The spicy and salty nature of my entree paired very well with the 4 spring rolls with their amazing sweet and spicy sauce. The white rice was well cooked and allowed me to do something I've never done with food delivered to a hotel room - I dropped portions of rice into the intoxicating Spicy Basil Chicken broth!  I got angry while eating this 5-star meal. Certainly not angry with Lucky Thai. Angry with the restaurants in my home town, that can't remember caring about fresh ingredients and cooking with love.  Angry with anyone who lives in Henderson and takes these artisans for granted. You know how groups sometimes will adopt a stretch of highway and keep,it clean?  I would ask Lucky Thai to consider adopting a Thai restaurant in Gainesville GA and teaching them the aluminum foil to-go trick that allows customers to savor intoxicating hot broths/sauces at home.  I can't wait until my next trip to Henderson. Kop kum krup!",

Nice quality meat better than many places.   The salad had mint in it which I'm not use to but it was very good.   Tom Yum Soup - very good but I have to say it was better the second day the broth got a little spicier.  Pad Kee Mao - Excellent my favorite by far a good amount of vegetables and very flavorful.   I wasn't sure where to start on the spice scale next time I'll go higher but it was very good and I'll be back",

The food is good and the atmosphere is nice. I ordered the pad thai and it is hard to find a place that makes unique, authentic, great tasting pad thai. Their pad thai was good, but not great.   The service is a little slow but that's ok. I'd rather them be slow and know they are making my food fresh then to get something microwaved and done in 5 minutes.   There are so many thai places in las vegas. If you want a quick eat or something to grab on the way home then this place is good. If you want more upscale, special event type thai food than I suggest looking elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'm baffled at the overall rating of this restaurant as my experience greatly differs from what appears to be the consensus. I actually should've known to run for the door once we were seated, as the initial look and smell of the restaurant was extremely displeasing. It's dingy, dusty, dirty, disorganized and smells like oil that's solidified and been sitting in a frying pan on the stove for a week! I figured we'd give it a try, pushing all that out of my mind with a \"just pretend you're in Thailand and in some hole in the wall\" mentality, which I'd soon come to regret.   It continued with the menus being tattered and dirty and needing to request clean silverware and eventually plastic silverware as they don't seem to have a decent dishwashing process. Then for the food, not good at all. The rice was stale, and trust me when I say it was old because I've been eating rice all my life. The only thing decent was the edamame, but when I got to the bottom of the bowl I found shrimp fragments (legs and parts of the body) just chilling at the bottom of my bowl. Mind you , I didn't order anything with shrimp. I pointed out to the server, who brushed it off. So I proceeded to approach the lady behind the bar/counter/storage and told her what I had found. All she could do was apologize and walk away and then present me with the check for the full amount. I'm sorry, I am never out for a freebie when I voice my concerns when dining, but she really made me pay $9 for edamame with shrimp fragments that for all I know could've come from someone's mouth! Disgusting!   Needless to say, I paid the bill, as walking out and getting arrested wasn't on my agenda for the day. However, I did file a complaint with the health department as this is one establishment that could definitely use a surprise inspection!",

    "text": "Going to this place was a mistake... we were looking for Thai close by and were drawn to this restaurant based on its 4.5 star rating. Everything is not always what it seems.   When we walked into the restaurant most tables were full except one, the plum booth off to the side. Everything was looking up: lots of clientele, an awesome table, and a general buzz among the dining class present in the restaurant.   We ordered the pineapple curry chicken, pad Thai beef, and sweet and sour pork.   The sweet and sour pork came in a bowl with the sweet red goo on the bottom of the bowl. The crispy pork pieces were lightly coated but it took a bit of digging to scoop out the food stuff. We had to dig, you see, because the red goo slurry and crispy pork pieces were buried by an avalanche of uncooked fruits and vegetables including large chunks of white onion, canned pineapple pieces, carrots, unripened tomatoes, and strips of green bell pepper. When I say \"uncooked\" I mean the chef took all those vegetables in her hands, looked at the sizzling frying pan, then tossed them all on top of the bowl. The tomato, for example, was refrigerator cold.   The pineapple curry chicken was maybe the best of the bunch, but the sauce felt a little grainy in my mouth. We made quick work of the chicken pieces in the dish, though, mostly because there was so little of the chicken pieces in the dish to begin with.   The pad Thai was bad Thai. The sauce tasted burnt and the beef pieces were of such low quality that they chewed like beef jerky. The taste wasn't anything I'd write home about, let alone a positive yelp review!  Next time I've got a hankering for Thai food I'm headed to Archi's!",

There were about maybe a cominbation of 10 booths and tables but this place is a popular spot for take-outs.  Decided to give this place a try based on my co-worker's recommendation. And I'm glad I did! I ordered the chicken pad kee mao. My favorite part was the garlic and basil...flavoring was packed to the punch! My boyfriend got chicken pad thai and soft-shell crab with basil. He enjoyed his pad thai a lot but he had better soft-shell crab at another thai restaurant we frequent. Our portions were a good size....enough for leftovers.  I usually get spiciness level 8 for Thai dishes and since this was a new restaurant, I decided to tone it down a notch. Should've toned it down two or three....because WOOWWWWW the spiciness level 7 was SPICY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It wasn't a hurt so good, it was a hurting my eyes are tearing up with a constant runny nose!!! So be careful....Lucki Thai's spice levels are no joke!!!!!!!!!!   I'm really glad I tried this place. We will definitely be back.",

If anything we over ordered and had to take some home. Wha wha wha.... We had the Tom yum shrimp soup which we literally almost picked up the pot and drank from it was so nice with good depth of flavor and not spicy ( I added their green chilies and some sambal to my soup to add heat). Then the pad Thai with chicken, pad see ewe with chicken, the pineapple fried rice with shrimp ( the shrimp were huge with the tails on and not over cooked), the green curry chicken spice level 5 on all the dishes and finally the Kung pao chicken to go for tomorrow's lunch and 4 beers and two hot teas and the check was under $100 with tip.  We loved that each dish has its own unique flavor not one homogenous taste like some restaurants have!   Great deal, GREAT food, nice and fast service and the place was super busy for Sunday and a huge take out business!!  You had me at hello! And no snarky hostess at the front desk!    My only complaint was it was not spicy enough. I will try a 6 or greater next time.  But this way you got to taste the depth of flavors of the items served!,",

Since it was my first time here I ordered the chicken Pad-Thai which is usually the most popular/common dish at most Thai places. For $9, the portions were larger than I expected and the food tasted fresh. My thai-iced tea was on point as well. Service was quick and friendly though there definitely is a language barrier with some employees. The restaurant is small with line of booth and few tables so I'd imagine it can get packed during lunch and dinner times. Overall Lucki Thai was a welcome experience amongst the glut of Thai restaurants here in Vegas.",

Also, I get take out all the times I go,  but my brief interactions with the staff are always super positive.  They are a very nice,  and they deliver quick service, while maintaining quality.   Shrimp pad Thai, great flavor and portion.  They are always good with not being skimpy on the shrimp. I like the noodle they use as well.  Some places use the type that looks like spaghetti, and I just am a flat noodle type of gal.   Chicken padseew is the best I've ever had,  super flavorful and not oily like some places.   Also, just right balance of greens without them becoming a filler.   The noodles and sauce have this amazing almost carmalization that just makes you want to take another bite.   Thai beef salad always generous with the beef,  amazing balance of sweet,  and tangy,  and full of herbs.   Only downside is sometimes the salad part is barely present,  and I have to add more lettuce myself.   Crab fried rice which is basically the lucki Thai fried rice with crab.  Huge portion.  Great building of flavor profiles.   Lucki Thai wings.  So crispy,  and the meat is tender, and that creamy aioli they serve it with is addictive.   They have other good items in their menu for sure,  and some I mentioned in my previous review, these are just standouts that I think go above a lot of their competition in the valley.  They also have a handful of items I have ordered in the past I think were sub-par that have tried in the past like their crab rangoons, calamari,  and chicken satay.   I however have not had those items recently,  so not sure if they have edited them to improve.",

I ordered the pad see ew with beef spicy level number 3 (medium) and a Thai tea through the Yelp app for take out.   My order was ready on time. The restaurant looked clean and the staff was prompt with getting me my order.  The Thai tea was really refreshing. It was creamy and tasty. The pad see ew was pretty good - I would say it was a little heavy on the salt. Also spicy level #3 was not spicy at all. I ended up putting Tabasco on it at the hotel. Also, they packaged my to-go order with sporks which did make it hard to eat. I ended up asking for a fork from the hotel instead.   Overall though, good experience and I would recommend this place to other fellow yelpers.",

The best thing that I ordered here (via the Yelp Eat 24 app) was the calamari and I think those were previously frozen. The chicken satay was good, but most Thai places can't mess this up. The peanut sauce was really good too. I put that on the other dishes to make them taste better.  The beef noodle soup was not good. The meat in that was not appetizing. The Lucki Thai fried rice was not what fried rice should be. It lacked so much flavor. The chicken wings were okay, nothing special.   I definitely did not feel 'lucky' eating here. I shouldn't have ordered $46 worth of food one my first visit. That was my mistake. I won't be coming back. They did, however, get everything right on my order and packed everything well for pick-up.",

This restaurant, in the Southeast part of town, will make you feel lucky, in more ways than one.  Lucki is one of the lesser known Thai restaurants around the Southeast part of town. It's an unassuming place located in a growing strip mall location, and it's been here for a few years. But this is not a spot that you should overlook, because they are making some very good, quality food, here.  So far, I've had a sampling of much of the menu over the years. One of my favorite Thai dishes is Basil Chicken, and they do an extremely well job of making it. Their heat levels are on point as well. When I ask for a 5, I get a 5. When I ask for a 2, I get a 2. They are accurate on their spicy levels. All the food that I've had here has been fresh, and well prepared. The flavors are bright and stand out.  This is probably the best Thai restaurant that is located in this part of town. Don't sleep on Lucki Thai, it's a very good restaurant, making very good food, with very competitive pricing.",

Whenever I visit any new Thai food place I always order Pad Thai, not only is it my favorite Thai dish, I use it a gauge to rate the restaurant.   Pad Thai was pretty good, noodles were soft and stretchy and it had a right balance of sweetness, with deliciously cooked vegetables.   Spice Level - 5/10  Spicy Pork Basil -. I know I'm supposed to eat this with rice, I just pushed that side and practically devoured this. Tastes so delicious, spicy and aromatic.    Spice Level - 5/10  Tom Yum Soup -  I'll give it props it cleared up my sinuses!! It had distinct hot and sour flavors, I enjoyed drinking the the basic broth full at the end of rich herbs and spices. Spice Level - 5/10  I was impressed with the service, the staff are nice, courteous and attentive. I didn't have to wait long for my food and I felt comfortable being there.",

    "text": "For Valentine's Day, we drove all over Las Vegas trying to eat at two of the highest Yelp rated restaurants in town.  Unbelievably, my quest to eat Louisiana food at Lola's and barbeque at Rolling Smoke BBQ was derailed  when we pulled into the parking areas for both these locations at around 7:30pm and found these places to be closed.  Closed on Valentine's day???!!!!!????  Their loss is another restaurant's gain.  Lucky for my family we found Lucki Thai and after eating here, I can unequivocally say that its awesomeness isn't due to luck.  For anyone staying at the Southpoint Casino, you're lucky to have such a gem of a restaurant just approximately 1.5 miles from the casino.  My experience with Lucki Thai is something that all of Las Vegas should drive near and far to see if what I will be writing is True.  Lucki Thai is worth the drive if you crave quality thai cuisine.  Lucki Thai is not a fancy place.  Rather, I'd characterize it as a Mom n Pop, hole in the wall type restaurant, which usually means it serves food to write home about.  It's not a big restaurant and mainly accommodates customers in booths.  There is Asian influenced decor, but it's low key and not too presumptuous.  The customer service from our waitress Ling Ling warrants the high 5-star Yelp rating along with the scrumptious thai food.  Ling Ling was soooo friendly, attentive, and made right on one of our dishes that was a little too spicy for 2/3s of my family.  Lucki Thai's dishes can compete and defeat other thai food I've experienced in San Diego, which is where we're from.  We ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken, garlic pepper shrimp, and the one dish I judge all thai restaurants, Pad Thai with beef.  The Tom Yum soup was a bountiful amount of succulent chicken, tomatoes, mushrooms, and tangy broth.  The soup came in a large bowl that had a large flame shooting from its center.  Initially, my wife and son took one bite of the garlic pepper shrimp and said they couldn't eat it because it was too spicy.  After telling Ling Ling about the shrimp being inedible, she quickly had it replaced with less spice and we devoured the shrimp like there was no tomorrow.  The Pad Thai at Lucki's was one of the best I've ever eaten.  The noodles had the right texture, the beef was cooked perfectly, and the mixing of the noodles, crushed peanuts, and bean sprouts made for a clean your plate experience.  I like spicy thai food, so I asked for medium spice (#5), which wasn't spicy at all.  I engulfed the pad thai along with a side of rice and a sprinkling of thai hot chili.    I told Ling Ling that I said compliments to the chef because they threw down the gauntlet when it comes to making yummy thai food.  Since Las Vegas will be a volleyball destination for many years, Lucki Thai will be a must visit whenever we're in town.  In the famous words of Dirty Harry, \"Do you feel lucky?\", I would have to say \"Yes\" especially if he's asking me about thai food at Lucki Thai.  As I said, it's not luck. It's just plain, outstanding food.",

I was going to give this place another try for delivery but for some reason I am not zoned in there area and the kicker is its like less then the recommend mileage.

The atmosphere is set up like many other small restaurant, I guess the good thing it isn't decorated too much with cluttered things. The place setting and utensil were clean and thats a good thing. The service was slow and very the servers were not very attentive. We got ignored a lot and I wasn't cool with that.  So maybe if they step up there service, I might come back for basic Thai food, only because I am too tired to drive farther for a better one.",

Chicken, duck, and the fish here are good for protein. Their tofu is a bit hard for my tastes but a lot of people like them.   I've eaten here probably 30 times and food has been consistent every time except one. Hope they keep it up.   Order a Thai style omelet if you want something off menu. It's as good as Thai noodle house.",

There were a few younger employees up front that were very welcoming and kind. I ordered a chai tea while we were waiting on our order and it too, was perfect.   When we got home, we unpacked our delicious meal and on the plain packaging, there were hand drawn pictures and lettering to let you know what item was inside- the kids loved it and this earned them some \"street-cred\" from our kids.   We can't thank them enough and we found our new favorite Thai spot!",

Order of shrimp pad Thai noodles were a bit undercooked and the shrimp had a \"warmed up in microwave\" feel to it. Spring rolls were excellent, egg drop soup was good and spicy basil tofu was good. Thai teas were perfect. So as I said, we will probably give it another chance, just might mention the minor issues with the pad Thai because if nobody says anything, how will they know?  Again, service was very good and that counts for a lot in my book.",

They do the papaya salad Laos style also which is a plus! Beef salad is always super tasty and juicy!  One flaw was when I order the BBQ chicken combo I got duck instead of chicken but it was still good. Luckily they didn't do it to the person after me!  But overall I'm always satisfied with my order here ! Must try!",

The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the tofu pieces were large and a great consistency. The price was also quite reasonable ($9). Can't wait to go back. This will definitely be my go to Thai place going forward!!!!",

I personally have a favorite Thai place downtown, but if I don't feel like driving all the way there- I think lucki Thai comes pretty close. The prices and the portions are better here as well which I like. The only thing I would say is if you are going to eat there, it's pretty small which is totally fine- it's cozy! But we came around 9 on a Saturday and we got lucky to get the last table. I would also say their spice levels were pretty spicy. I got a 4 on my soup and I was sweating, don't get me wrong though the soup was amazing!! I am excited to come back.",

Service was excellent and very, very friendly.  Prices were very, very reasonable  Everything we ordered was wonderful, artfully presented and huge!   We were in Las Vegas for only four days but went back a second time because we liked the little restaurant so much.  We had fried soft shell crab with fried rice and also the soft shell crab appetizer.  Both were excellent.  We also ordered the beef salad, chicken Panang curry, Prik beef, chicken satay appetizer, shrimp tempura appetizer, and papaya salad (huge!).   For dessert we had the sweet sticky rice with sliced mango swimming in a coconut sauce.  We ordered level 7-8 for spicy dishes which was not too hot, just right.   We had a lot left over that we just couldn't finish - I recommend that you order just one or two plates to share and then order more if you are still hungry.",

The presentation of the food gives you the feel of an upscale restaurants. The interior is nice. It's not overly fancy but it fits the food very well.  I had the flagship Panang Curry. I picked level four for the heat and it was perfectly spicy for me. The waitress told me they have 10 levels of spice which sounded about right because lots of Thai places have many levels of heat or spiciness.  My wife ordered a pineapple fried rice with pork at a heat level number two. It wasn't too hot at all and the waitress was the one who suggested number two spiciness.  It was a little spicy when I tasted it and as with all spicy food I knew it would be a little spicier than my first few bites so I knew it would be pretty spicy for her. Ever notice how spicy food get spicier as you eat it?  Ever drink a hot drink like coffee after eating something spicy? Anyway the Thai tea took the kick of the spice down a notch which was perfect. The food was very very good as well as the service and presentation. It was easy to get to the location and easy to find and it has all your Thai favorites. I'm glad I have a new place to go to. I've eaten a lot of Mediterranean and Mexican food since I've been in Henderson LOL.",

I normally always get green curry. But the yellow curry was mentioned on lots of reviews so I tried it. It was excellent as advertised. I also got the drunken noodles with chicken. If the place was a little dimly lit.. and I had privacy. I would have taken my pants off :) kidding aside I would recommend trying this place. Service was prompt and polite.   Only negative is that there is limited seating. So if they get busy. It could be a wait.",

Today I thought I'd save myself money by ordering pick up so I wouldn't have to pay delivery charges. When I get there they tell me my total is 23.95. This is about how much j pay when I get it delivered. The receipt says each item is 10.95 .... when asked they told me it's because they charge extra for veggies when you pick up. Wtf?? This place is such a scam. I was never told the veggies were going to be extra and don't see why it would cost more than if I ordered a regular meat entree. Chicken beef or vegetable doesn't cost extra on your yelp menu and it shouldn't be different just because I'm picking it up in person. Also, I asked for no egg in my fried rice and of course, when I get home there's egg in it. I called and let them know and she tried to tell me I said egg was ok. Egg was not okay and you should know that because YOU'RE the one who asked me if I wanted eggs in it and I said NO. Very unhappy and will not be returning.",

The food is authentic, and occasionally they'll do a twist and create something original like their soft shell crab fried rice, and it becomes a favorite.

    "text": "You cannot imagine how LUCKI we felt finding this restaurant.  Ironically, they were located in the same small strip mall as the place we had originally decided to eat.  Un-luckily (or maybe not), that place was closed. A quick Yelp search settled that dilemma, and Mr. B moved the car about 50 feet.  Its location determined its size. It was small, most certainly, but pleasant and clean. It was a non-peak hour, and we had the place to ourselves.  The food was plenteous and came out quickly.  Again, Lucki.  Our order was fairly predictable and non-adventurous, but absolutely no regrets:  *Tom Yum Soup with shrimp - a good, sour version with 3 large shrimp.  It came in a small bowl, a serving enough for one for lunch, or two if you are planning to order other dishes.  *Yellow Curry with pork - delicious.  We got spice level #3.  It was just enough to make the creamy, flavorful sauce have an interesting bite to it, not spicy enough for wussie me to complain. There was plenty of meat, but also a lot of potato and carrot.  *The Beef Jerky appetizer - thick slices of marinated beef strips, fried then served with a spicy red sauce that was over the top good.  Again, just enough spice to make it interesting.  It was not real dry, as implied by the name Jerky...just lean and flavorful.  I loved it.  *The Lettuce Wrap. Other than having to ask for more lettuce leaves because there was too much filling (such a dilemma), this was a great tasting appetizer.  Served with a side of plum sauce, the meat filling was seasoned beautifully.  A great dish and plenty to feed the 4 of us.  *Pad See Ewe with chicken - Made with wide rice noodle, broccoli, carrot, and thin slices of chicken, this was done perfectly too.  Our (well, maybe only mine) only disappointment was there was no mango and sticky rice dessert.  As in the Goldilocks story, somebody ate it all up before we got there.    All in all, this was a solid and delicious meal at a price that could not be beat, $40 for the 4 of us.  I am looking forward to a follow up visit and a generous tummy full of Lucki-ness next time we are in Sin City.",

We were trying to decide what to eat for lunch one day and this place popped up on my Yelp search. After reading all the good reviews, we landed here. They have various lunch specials ranging from Pad Thai to spicy basil to curry. You choose what meat you want and your lunch also comes with egg drop soup, salad and an egg roll. All for $7.95. I chose the spicy basil with chicken and the bf chose the yellow curry with chicken. And the reviews weren't a lie. Everything was so good!! Our main dishes were so flavorful and they did not skimp on the meat. My bf's curry had huge chucks of chicken and bell peppers. And my spicy basil chicken was perfectly spiced. The portions are huge, so don't worry about being hungry afterwards. Our server was awesome and you could tell how happy he was when we kept telling him how good the food was.   Besides the lunch menu, they do have a full menu that is very simple, no frills. I do hope that this place sticks around because this is now my favorite Thai spot!   P.S. They have honey toast, but it is a 20 minute wait.",

Got seated right away but then again it was like 9pm  Decor needs a little update. Seats were all torn out  Space is a little small. Which is a good thing coz you know it's a whole in a wall type thing.   Didn't get a chance to take pics coz we were so hungry  Had the chicken wings appetizer (took long to come) prolly won't order it again coz there was nothing that says Thai about those wings.   I got the chicken red curry and let me tell you they were so good! They got the right amount of spiciness and thickness it's not watered down and it was a lot.   My bf got the drunken noodles and he loved it, it's not dry like others we've tried b4.  Will def come back here and very happy we found a really good Thai plan around our neighborhood. Too bad they don't deliver to our area.   This would have easily gotten 5 stars but can't get pass the leather seats they are peaking off and tissue on the floor holding the table to be even.",

I had the pad thai with chicken (spicy level 4), while my boyfriend had the yellow chicken curry (spicy level 2) with rice, both $8.95. My dish had just the right amount of food -- savory, with the bean sprouts and peanuts perfectly separated. The chicken wasn't the best. The pieces were on the rough side. A lot of Thai places use this kind. I tried the yellow curry, and loved how their potatoes seemed to be marinated. The carrots didn't seem to match, and tasted too raw. Service was good. The gal with the glasses kept checking on us, along with the older male tending the front counter. People were coming in and out for their to-go orders, so business seems to be going well. Will definitely come back.",

Towards the end of our meal, we also got to see how they were very accommodating to one large walk-in group, and still managed to accommodate another large group that made reservations. Customer service, alone, deserves five stars. Anyway, the boyfriend ordered Pad See Ew, and I ordered a Thai Boba Milk Tea and Honey Toast with Vanilla Ice Cream. LOL. The boyfriend liked his dish, but said it wasn't spicy enough, even after ordering a level spice of ten. What a weirdo, right?  I totally liked my dessert! Can't really go wrong with that though. It was like eating bread pudding, but I just dug into the center with melting ice cream, avoiding the toasted crust area. I liked my Thai Boba Milk Tea, but I wouldn't come here specifically for that.",

But unlike most places including the two mentioned above, when you say 8-9 on the spicy scale this place actually does it. I have said 10 at some places and had it burn like a 1. I think being white has a little to do with it but this place obviously doesn't see race. I like it spicy. And they make it spicy. So I'll be back.",

Plus as one nears the restaurant the wonderful aromas just fill your senses and make your taste buds water at what's coming. Lunch baby!  When I walked through the door I was seated immediately and handed a menu. They had a fantastic lunch special that was almost too good to be True too! Decided on veggie fried rice, which comes with a house salad, wonton, egg roll, and egg drop soup for $9.95.  As I sit here and eat my lunch I am so happy for dining here since with great wait service and food one can not ask for more. Plus my foot continues to tap constantly to the golden oldies of my day. With such bands as the Beatles and Journey. The right music makes you want to get up and dance while eating lunch, but I have controlled the urge since this is not my living room.   The taste of lunch was so wonderful all of my senses present and dazzled. The veggies were steamed so perfectly. The colors used by the different veggies also gave so much color to my lunch plate making it so much more appetizing. The egg roll and its accompanying sweet and sour sauce were amazing. Even the egg drop soup was amazing with great balance and harmony with the flavors. Aerosmith is now playing so I'm going to sit back and enjoy the beats with the rest of my wonderful lunch",

    "text": "It's been a few years that I've been here, especially according to my last review I did of this place, so here's an updated version!  Place an online order for take out through yelp, only ordered a couple items. I ordered their version of chicken soup, which it looked like chicken pho, just not with all the extras that you can add to it. First impression, they gave you a lot! Smelled good, looked good! Next was the taste, now it wasn't your typical pho chicken broth, but the broth wasn't bad, a little strong. They add green onions, bean sprouts, chicken and the noodles, that was basically your chicken soup. The only thing that I do have to say is the noodles soaked up the broth and it was mushy.   The second item that was ordered was their wonton egg noodle soup.Now when I ordered it awhile ago it was just wontons, egg noodle, bok choy, green onions and I believe carrots. This time though, they added all the above with chicken and beef, there was a lot going on. I wasn't a huge fan, I enjoyed the simple wonton, egg noodle and bok choy that came with broth. It was a lot, some of the meat was chewy and there were chunks of ginger that took me unexpectedly.   I do have to say that this place has gotten busier, they added a couple tables to the joint, so it makes it hard to get to the counter, you don't want to bump into someone's chair or table. Overall, I'm glad that they have become more known and that they still make some good food. Maybe I just wont get soup anymore and stick to their basics!",

    "text": "I love Thai Food, and when we were in this side of town we came across this place by using Yelp! The food was delicious! I read another yelpers review regarding the spiciness levels. I too usually get a 8 when the range is 1-10, but she said she wishes she toned it down a couple of numbers cause the spiciness is on another level. So, I got Chicken Pad Thai number five.   When I first took a bite I was like \"Oh, shoot it's so spicy\" but I love spicy so it wasn't tooooo bad, but later on it started having no spicy. I think the spiciness was all just on one side, and it happened to be in the first couple of bites I took. It wasn't like there was a bunch of chili flakes on that side or anything, it was all one color, so I didn't know I should have mixed it.  I had leftovers and ate it this morning, and there was very  little to no spice. I guess I should have mixed it around. I wish I lived closer to this place. Spiciness level aside, the sauce was so good and the Pad Thai wasn't dry.  My boyfriend got fried rice. He said it was really good. We also ordered crab rangoons, that was also good   The service was perfect! We arrived at the perfect time as a big party came in right after and we would have had to wait.",

We ended up throwing most of it out. I guess we will take a break from ordering at this restaurant on Silverado Ranch for a while. This place lacks the quality control to stay in business. We stopped dining In because the booth seating is all torn up and sinking., so we just order to go or delivery.",

    "text": "My mom, family friends, and I were in Las Vegas - pit stop on our road trip to LA, and we were looking for some good Asian food on our day of exploring Las Vegas before we hit up the Strip later that night.  I found this place on yelp, and it did not disappoint! It's about 15 minutes away from the strip (but our airbnb was super close, so definitely not inconvenient for us), and it's some solid Thai food. Low prices, great service, and a huge portion! Especially if you get their lunch special.   I ordered their papaya salad because I wanted something refreshing and light, especially in the desert heat that Las Vegas is notorious for. It was light, crunchy, acidic, and bright - the papaya and accompanying vegetables were satisfying without making me feel heavy or sick after eating it. THe brightness and acidity from the vinaigrette helped to keep it appetizing and pulling me back for more. Everyone else ordered different lunch specials, but unanimously agreed that it was delicious not only because it was well done/well seasoned, but also because the restaurant gives huge portions!  It's located in a strip mall, so it's a little unassuming at first, but I think it's a legit delicious Thai joint. Plenty of parking in the lot, and it wasn't terribly packed whenever we went for lunch - great option if you're in the Vegas area looking for a filling Asian lunch outside of the strip.",

I can't stand when I order flat noodles and they come out all clumped together or dry/lack of sauce or the noodles are way more than the ingredients, but with Lucki Thai they do it right. I've also had their crab fried rice, bbq chicken and sticky rice, fried banana and ice cream, almost all their apps and nothing has disappointed me",

It's in a plaza, the booth had cracked vinyl which kind of hurts your legs, but the service and food and pricing was worth it. The service was super fast and friendly enough, the pricing was very reasonable, portions were generous and the food tasted delicious! The only thing I would say is be careful with the spice level, We ordered 6 and it was super spicy...at least to us! We have ordered 6 level at other Thai places and they were tame; here it was too much for us, so next time we'll probably do a 4 or 5.",

Everyone I have dealt with here has been very friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  In my opinion, if you are in the area, this place and Galangal are the two best options for the price around.",

The women are so sweet and friendly and the food is always good! My parents are always here ordering take out as well.    This is my favorite Thai spot.  The yellow curry and chicken Pad Thai is sooo good I came back twice in one week lol.  This is definitely my go to spot for Thai food when I am in town!   Plus: they offer military discount which out here is unheard of, so I was even happier to hear they offer a 10% discount, just ask before paying!

The laab was at a level 5, but I honestly didn't taste any spiciness to it. I didn't even really eat it because it felt too bland to me where I wasn't a fan of the flavoring.   Mango sticky rice was good. The mangos tasted great and the rice was made well.  I'll definitely give them another chance but try other things.",

Rude customer service with no explanation why we has to have that way.   So finally I got my order  She had me that like it's a soup kitchen free food  Not even sorry or thank you.

    "text": "I want to start off by saying I hate being a picky customer. However over the last year I've been slowly cutting meat out of my diet, and some of the most veggie friendly places (without going to a full on vegan restaurant) are Thai or Indian. So I came in here the other night with my friend to try it out.  I ordered pineapple curry with veggies. The server repeated back my order to me as pumpkin curry with chicken. I have no idea how it became a completely different order, but I just kindly corrected her and she repeated it back again correctly this time.  But then my food came out as pineapple curry with chicken... I was confused how this happened since I already made a point I didn't want meat. I'd understand if it was just one mixup or the other, but to mess up the order twice...  They did switch out my food when I pointed it out, but this made me feel really bad as I hate sending back food. And my friend was just left to eat her food alone while I sat there waiting. It just made the whole experience pretty awkward... I did try some of her Pad Thai and it was alright.   The flavors of the curry were good and I enjoyed the spice level (10 had a kick) but I feel like giving meat to vegetarians/vegans is pretty offensive. Especially if someone is doing so for religious reasons. I just really hope they didn't throw all that chicken away bc that would completely defeat the purpose :|",

When it was half full it was immediately filled back up. The food also came out pretty quick as well without crowding the food that was just brought out to enjoy. The wait time between each food item was spot on.   Also, everything was plated  very beautifully.   Got a couple apps to start, the shumai, and crab rangoons. Both were stellar. The flavors, the temperature, the taste, literally everything. Nothing was lacking a particular flavor and didn't have too much of a certain flavor.   Got the Pad Woon Sen Chicken and it was spot on. When I ordered it the waitress said it is very good. She recommended the chicken. The glass noodles were cooked perfectly, the mushrooms, carrots, onions, etc were perfectly paired and seasoned.   The sweet n sour chicken was also very good. It was fresh and flavorful. It also came with rice.   See pics for all items mentioned. I am sad to have to go back to MN soon. I will definitely come back here on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

A lot of people seem to order to go here, but the dining environment is also cozy and it's pretty packed all around!   I ordered yellow curry and my friend ordered a pad thai; they're safe choices but the place makes both of them very well. The pad thai is flavorful without being overly sweet like other Thai spots make them.  The service is good too; servers are patient and attentive, and the food gets to you in a timely manner!   My only criticism is if you like your food spicy, this place doesn't kick it up at all. I ordered a 10 on the spice scale and it felt something like a 2. That, and the rice portions are notably smaller than that of other Thai restaurants in the valley, so you may be more likely to need a second rice serving here as a result. But as far as the food goes, it's great!",

    "text": "Went in on a busy Wednesday night.   Didn't realize until our food came that the server did not ask us are spice level nor did it dawn on us to let her know.   The food then came out so-so.  We had the Tom Kha soup, yellow curry, garlic chicken, and chicken satay for appetizers.  The soup was delicious and I added spices to kick it up a bit.  The satay was less than desirable as they came out with the sauce already on- and heavily applied.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to either state that in the menu or communicate that while taking the order.   It took away from the grilled taste and there was no need to dip into the additional sauce supplied as the skewers were already drenched.   The people that we dined with have been to this location before and we'll take their word that this was an outlier experience.  However, not necessarily in a rush to get back to the table.  We look forward to the next opportunity.    Just a note, I believe that I am responsible for my own 5 star experience ANYWHERE and that simply complaining about a spot or throwing shade is not fair to any establishment putting out a product.",

Food was very good. Papaya salad was very fresh tasting, lots of lime juice and spice. Beef salad excellent. Beef tasted like it had been grilled. massaman curry with beef and green curry with pork were both very good. Restaurant served jasmine rice which is a bonus.   Very friendly staff and nice ( but small) eat in restaurant.   July 2019  Just as good as last time we went. Warning for those who don't like super spicy food...5 out of 10 is spicy!",

    "text": "We originally wanted to eat at the Japanese restaurant located in the same plaza as Lucki Thai, but we saw how empty that restaurant looked compared to the many customers at Lucki Thai ... and so we made the decision to take our business there instead.   We arrived fairly early on a Friday night and yet we were surprised at how busy the restaurant was. They're located quite far from the strip, so I felt like many of the other patrons were probably locals. There are a good number of tables inside, and food comes out at a solid pace from the kitchen.   There are a good number of items to choose from such as soups, salads, curry, entree, rice/noodles, noodle soups, and their special items.   I went with my go-to at most Thai places - the Tom Yum Noodle soup ($8.95). I was pretty surprised at how cheap the price was considering the amount that was given. I've had other Tom Yum Noodle soups, but every place makes it a little differently so I don't really know for sure which is considered authentic. The one from Lucki Thai had a lot of ground pork, some fish balls, some BBQ pork, and some cilantro thrown into the soup, which I thought was a little odd - I liked the variety, but I've never had a Tom Yum soup with BBQ pork. It almost seemed Chinese in a way, especially with the rice vermicelli. There was a lot of chopped peanuts, which brought out the soup flavors, but everything else didn't really make sense. Not to say I didn't like the dish, but it just didn't go together too well. The noodles were cooked well and I liked the flavor of the soup - not too spicy and went well with the rainy weather that Vegas was having that particular day. Also could taste the slight acidity and herb flavoring from the lemongrass. But probably wouldn't order this again since it was a little strange.   Yellow chicken curry with rice: $8.95 they paired the rice with the other dishes that came with rice, so each individual portion was quite small. Rice was cooked really well and went perfectly with the curry. Yellow curry came with onions, potatoes, and carrots - a very standard curry. They gave a decent amount and the flavors were spot on. No hint of spiciness and the curry went very well with the rice. Chicken was pretty juicy and tender - overall nothing negative about this dish.   Beef pad thai: $8.95 nothing special, but the price wasn't too bad considering the freshness of the dish. The beef kind of reminded me of the one from Yoshinoya's beef bowl, but the flavors were good.   Yellow curry cod filet: $10.95 the most expensive item that we ordered. This was very similar to the yellow chicken curry except that the protein was fish. The cod filet was pretty soft and easy to cut into. I normally don't order fish, but I can see why people would enjoy it. It went decently with the curry and rice. I wouldn't mind trying this another time.   We also ordered calamari ($7.95) as an appetizer to share. Thought this was fried nicely with the perfect amount of batter outside the fish. Came with some radish shoestrings and a sweet and sour dip that I didn't really enjoy. Honestly the calamari tasted better on its own than with the dip.   Workers were quite friendly and quick to refill our water. But my uncle was a little miffed that the waiter gave us the bill while we were still eating dinner, making us feel as if they wanted us to pay and leave as soon as possible despite there not being a wait.   tl;dr - We were all pretty satisfied with the meal. Prices were decent and the food tasted good. There wasn't anything outstanding, but nothing that was horrible either. But we probably would not make the drive back out to this part of Vegas just for Lucki Thai.",

My girlfriend ordered the [chicken] Lettuce Wrap, which was a large portion of meat, chopped up finely, seasoned, and served with a side of romaine lettuce.  Break off a leaf of the lettuce, put the meat on top and fold it in half.  Dip it into their delicious sauce, and enjoy!  I ordered the Panang Curry with a spicy level of 6 (on a scale of 1-10).  It was DELICIOUS.  It's a good sized portion with chicken, broccoli, and other vegetables.  The curry is delicious, just the right amount of spice and a hint of coconut flavor.  It's paired with a side of white rice but I opted for the brown rice.  Unbelievable.  Service was excellent.  All of the workers were kind and came to check up on us frequently.  My water cup was refilled so often that it seemed like I never took a sip of it at all!    There's always plenty of parking so GO GO GO!",

I'm not a seafood fan, so I can't attest to that, but here's what we have tried: yellow chicken curry, pineapple chicken curry (hands down fav), steamed potstickers, egg rolls (husbands fav), chicken pad Thai, Pad woon sen chicken, orange sauce chicken, egg drop soup, pineapple fried rice chicken, lucki thai fried rice chicken (delicious). Everything is great and prices are fantastic.",

Table spices were super fresh (hotter than I expected) and the noodles were excellent.  5 stars.  My friend's meal: Pad woon sen:  2.5 out of 5 (by her reporting); she ordered \"combination: chicken, beef, and shrimp\" and received LITERALLY one (1) shrimp.  ONE.... The flavor of the noodles was great, she said, but there were way too many onions, carrots, and not enough meat.",

Everything we ordered was hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned and tasted just like it does when we eat in the restaurant. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. We ordered the Chicken Larb salad and the beef jerky for starters. They were both so good we ate every bite. For entrees we got the yellow curry with chicken for my hubs and I had the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp. So good and portions large enough for us to have lunch tomorrow. We ended our delicious dinner by sharing the mango and sticky rice dessert that even though we were full, ate every bite. We are the Lucky ones to have such amazing Thai so close to our home. Thanks again Lucky Thai you did not disappoint!",

    "text": "If you're a fan of Archi and live around the Silverado area, well no fear! Lucki Thai is here! I came here a few times and I will continue to go because I'm glad there is finally a decent restaurant around the corner of my house. The owner is a past worker at Archi so I knew that the food wouldn't be a disappointment. Lunch and dinner are two different experiences. Lunch time offers a cheaper lunch menu and your order is accompanied by a cup of soup. But not all items are on the lunch menu so you'll have to find something you like on that menu or pay more on the dinner menu. I recommend the lunch Pad Thai, it's a great portion for lunch and very delicious. Their Pad Thai is the best Pad Thai in Vegas, it's the closest to homemade. Dinner time, I like to have noodles like Pad See Ewe or Pad Woon Sen, but I also like to come with my family to have family style dinner. If you come with a large group, there aren't big tables, but they'll try to make it happen. I recommend ordering rice dishes with bigger parties. Now, the restaurant is pretty small with only a few tables so it seems like takeout is the most popular here. In one sitting, I noticed that at least 10 people come in and out with togo orders. So this restaurant is great for lunch and dinner dine-in experiences or simply taking your food togo. It's an extremely convenient location with great food!  *came back for a third time, tried the Beef Noodle Soup and absolutely, but I also ordered the Pad Thai for a second time and had a slight disappointment. The Pad Thai was so much better the first time I had it, I feel like the food needs to be more consistent. I love the food, I just hope that the food stays great and doesn't change for the worst.",

Their minimum $$ amount to order is well below other places around the area. So if you are ordering for yourself you don't have to spend 50$ to get food to your door.

Here's what we ordered:  Tom Yum soup with shrimp - My husband didn't quite enjoy that extra kick, but I loved it. It wasn't like a spicy kick...more like a tangy-ish one? The shrimps were huge!  Pad Thai with shrimp - Really delicious and the portion was pretty generous.  Pad See Ewe with beef - It was good, but my husband said it was slightly burnt tasting. I didn't really catch that though. The dish didn't look burnt so he thinks it was the pan used for cooking the pad see ewe that was.  Dessert: Fried Banana with French vanilla ice cream - OMG, I almost died! It was THAT amazing and I don't even like bananas! The fried banana was nice and hot. The skin was crispy and inside was the oogey gooey banana with some coconut flakes. The ice cream, I am not sure if it was made by the chef for if it was from a carton because it tasted homemade. It had a very thick and creamy texture to it. It was mind blowing when paired with the fried banana. The server came by to ask me how it was and I, very shamelessly said, \"It's SOOOOO goood!\" which made him laugh.  Eat here people!",

We have had the larb at Lotus of Siam and Chada Thai and we prefer Lucki Thai's over both places. :-) please support this place. I peeked in the kitchen and everything looked super clean. Did I mention they deliver too. I was always a lotus snob after trying other thai spots and this has changed my mind. The only thing I would say was negative is that it is right across the street from my house and I will now be frequenting this place way more than I should. Flavors are amazing, balanced, and complex... just what Thai cuisine is. I even called them after my meal to tell them how good of a job they are doing.",

I've been coming to Lucki Thai since I moved onto this side of town, and I have brought almost everyone I know here so that they too can have an exceptional experience. From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated as the most special guest, and the familiar faces there literally know your name and remember your order! (The server Ling is top notch) The atmosphere feels comfortable and the facility is always clean. The consistency of the food between visits is always on point, and you ALWAYS know that your meal will be just as good as it was the last time. The lunch specials are really affordable and they come with salad and egg drop soup. The Shrimp Pad Thai is remarkable, the chicken fried rice is BOMB, the crab fried rice has a whole dang crab sitting on top, the Tom yum soup is exactly what you need if you ever feel under the weather (a level 7 will knock a cold right out of you), and the Spicy Basil is always good. THEY HAVE THE BEST THAI TEA IN ALL OF LAS VEGAS! Honey toast is so good you have to give thanks between bites (I'll literally go there in the summer just for the Honey Toast AND it's my must have for every birthday) and of course the classic sweet sticky rice is to die for! When you get a delivery order it is just as good as dining in, it arrives hot and way faster than a pizza delivery! I type this as I enjoy my delivery of chicken fried rice, pot stickers, and Thai tea! I almost don't want to share with anyone how good this place is, it truly is THAT good! Sighhhh words really don't do this place justice, you have to go see for yourself!",

I went and picked up and they were so unbelievably nice and friendly. Not too talkative (I don't want to stand around and chat while my food gets cold) but greeted me and we exchanged a few words.   I'm used to the typical eye roll at my usual place. I totally didn't think they were thinking, \"another white girl too lazy to cook for her husband... Again.\"  anyway... They were so nice as I drove home I was really hoping to like this place since it was so close and they were so nice.   They even punched holes in the crab ragoon container so they would not get soggy.   Their pad Thai was absolutely unbelievably bomb. I'm from Chicago and we have Thai everywhere and so far I have not found anything I really like as much this comes super super close.   I got a little too spicy and there was definitely a little kick to it but perfect.  You need to order this pronto.   The crab ragoon were solid but I would actually skip them in favor of their noodles.    I mean their noodles. Omg so so good. Just order now.",

I was nervous to call because I wasn't sure if the service would even be decent or what to expect in general. My friend recommended this place to me, so I figured I'll give it a shot.  I was really glad I did! The girl who answered the phone was super polite and helpful. I asked a lot of questions and she maintained kindness and was very professional.  I ordered the crab fried rice. It was ready quickly and the guy at the counter was super friendly! The crab fried rice tasted delicious!!! It even lasted me 3 meals. It was awesome and I'll definitely be back!!! So happy I gave them a chance!",

The soup was good with just a hint of heat in flavour but the #4 level in my Pad See Ewe was way too spicy when I first are it. I couldn't finish it so I put it up as leftovers. The next day I tried it again and mixed it around and it wasn't as spicy. I think maybe they just put the peppers on top in one spot and I just ate it like that the first time. All in all the food was good Thai and if you like spicy then this place is for you because even a 4 out of 10 will have you tearing up!",

Panang and basil were amazing with lots of vegetables and great flavor. The pad see u (I know I spelled that wrong) is amazing and is my GF favorite. The tom yum soup surprised me here! I typically order Tom Kah soup but wow, the Tom yum is a no brainer here. Idk how to describe it but it's def a must try! (Gonna try the Tom Kah today for the 1st time).  Lastly, the service is top notch. The staff really cares about your satisfaction and is always quick to check on hiw everything is tasting.

The food got here faster then expected and everything was nice and hot. I ordered the beef noodle soup, crab fry rice, papaya salad, 2 orders of bbq chicken and papaya salad combo. Everything was grrreeat, except the bbq chicken was a little on the greasy side and a little pink in the middle. Wished they would make the grill chicken just like the streets of Thailand. Now that would be some flavorful and delicious grill chicken! Anyways, I love the fact that's it's conveniently located. The food here is good and the staff is super friendly should you dine in.",

    "text": "Lucki Thai does noodle dishes pretty well! One of the main reasons why I love Thai food is the balance and punch of all the flavors of, sweet, salty, savory, and spice with delicious vegetarian options  Pad see ew AKA pad see oOoOohhhh! Definitely, one of the better versions that I have ever had. The flavors were on point, super tasty, without being overwhelming. The pad see ew had a generous amount of fried tofu and mustard greens, which added a textural element as well as another flavor profile to the dish. I did not mind the bitterness and mustard-y taste of the greens, but this may not sit well with others. The noodles were okay. A plus on the noodles is that they were not clumpy together. The dish could have used more noodles, especially to equalize the ratio with the tofu and greens.   I had pad thai a couple times and it was great! Not disappointed with the flavors at all. Definitely, not a bland dish. A safe dish to try for the first time.   The yellow curry with chicken was a miss for me.  The curry was good, but the potatoes and onions could have been cooked longer. Biting in the onions was overwhelming and so I ended up just avoiding them. The spice level of 4 / 10 was pretty accurate.   In the past I have had their BBQ chicken with sticky rice and papaya salad. Thai BBQ still has the best BBQ chicken, but Lucki Thai's version is pretty good. I did not care for the sticky rice and opted for plain white rice. The papaya salad is good, but on the sweet side.   I see myself coming back if I am in the area, but with so many Thai options in town, it's not really my go-to.  *****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge***** 3/100",

I had the Cashew Nut w/ Chicken, and hubby had the Broccoli w/ Chicken. I ordered mine a 5 (spicy scale 1-10) and his was a 2. Both were spot on, his was just spicy enough to add to the savory brown sauce, and mine was the perfect heat without making my eyes water and nose run! I've been looking for a new favorite Thai restaurant having moved to LV in May, I think we found it! Absolutely perfect!",

Today I branched out a bit and ordered panang curry with crispy duck and it was sooo good, I didn't even know I liked duck! Pad see ew with Chicken was delicious, great flavor with super thin noodles and a good amount a veggies as well as chicken, and the spicy basil pork was awesome with great flavor- I got 5 out of 10 stars for spice which was the perfect amount of spice for me and I'm kind of a wimp. And I got a Thai ice tea, yum. Great Thai food with large portions and reasonable prices. Their 4.5 star rating is accurate :)",

It was clean, I enjoyed the setup and the dim lighting  Food - Excellent! There were so many options on the menu it was hard to chose, they also had a vegetarian friendly menu. Huge portions, great value, and the food itself was amazing. Food is spicier than most thai places, they warn you, so make sure you don't get anything over a 3 if you only want mild spice.  Service - Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful and quick. My boyfriend was clearly struggling with his Pad Thai (which was a level 5 spice) but, we weren't going to ask for a new one or complain, but the server offered to make him a new one. It was a very kind gesture.  Will be back!",

The soup were too sweet, I had to ask for lime juice on the side to even out the taste a little bit but it still need some fish sauce, they put too much sugar in it. Fried rice didn't have enough seasoning, eggplants weren't soft enough...and oh I almost forgot I ordered sticky rice with mango, I think they forgot to add salt in it and it was too sweet and the mango was too over ripe.....I might go back again but I'll stick with one dish.",

Everything is made fresh to order! I get a takeout most times and the food comes out in less than 15 minutes.  I usually get a 4 (out of 10) for the Pad See Ew and its just right on the spice! Enough spice to elevate the dish but not spicy to the point that my eyes are watering. I think the only negative to the dish is that for me there is more broccoli compared to noodles. (Might just have been on most recent order, I don't keep track of this all the time.)  I look forward to trying more things from the menu. Thats if I don't break my Pad See Ew habit!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I recently discovered this restaurant and we could not be more impressed! The food is fantastic and it has the BEST service!  The wait staff are very attentive and friendly, and the food always comes out super fast.  I LOVE the tom kha here,  some places it is too creamy, but here it is a perfect blend of coconut and lime flavors. Plus, you can get it in a small size bowl , not just the big one (although now I get the big one to take some home with me!) The egg rolls always come out perfectly crispy without being overdone. The pad thai with tofu came out perfectly sweet and tangy. We tried the fish cakes for the first time, and we were super happy with them! They came with a little side cucumber and carrot salad with a sweet sauce.  We will definitely keep coming here to try the different dishes we've never had before.",

Maybe more than I needed but figured great for later. Delivery was so fast and the food was hot still! Their customer service is fantastic when dining in. Plenty of open seating and clean establishment for those who order and haven't seen it in person. I absolutely love Lucky Thai and highly recommend any dish as they've all been delicious.",

I had to search for a place that could offer something similar to my favorite place called Thai Room. I happened to come across Lucky Thai! I've seen such great reviews about it and gave it a try. I ordered the Pad Thai through online with Yelp. It was quick and easy and the staff followed through my order very well. I picked up my food after 15-20 minutes. I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai and it had a lot of Tofu in it. I'm a big fan of tofu! So it's not me complaining. Haha. The taste of the Pad Thai was great! It wasn't as perfect as the other place I truly favor but this was enough for me compared to the other places. I hate sour Pad Thai. I consider it fake Pad Thai. Lol. This place was indescribable. That sweet peanut Pad Thai taste but not too sweet if that makes sense? The portion size of it was enough to feed 3-4 people. I gave it a 4 star for now because I still have yet to try their other dishes!",

    "text": "Decided to order delivery from here since my favorite delivery Thai place (Galanga) was closed :(   I'm kicking myself in the butt for ordering shrimp yellow curry instead of chicken  I paid 4$ extra for shrimp and quite literally only received 5 shrimps in my curry. With the tails on.  Which normally wouldn't bother me at all because I love shrimp but with runny curry I'm finding shrimp tail pieces I have to avoid eating because I poured the curry over the rice. That's not a total deal breaker though, as I said, my fault I should've got chicken!! The carrots are finely sliced and the potatoes are just okay. With all that being said the 4 stars really goes to THE CURRY ITSELF WHICH IS AMAZING. I wish it came with more stuff though, I have soooo much liquid and barely any protein or veggies.   The Thai Tea is nothing to complain about but I've definitely had better and definitely had worse.   I ordered around 5pm and was quoted an hour, pleasantly surprised when it was delivered a lot quicker than that. For the price of the food (minus the shortage of shrimp) id say I got what I paid for.",

Lucky Thai has hands down the very best Chicken Satay I have ever had, very strongly recommended.  Their Pad Thai is also very nicely done. A lot of places don't seem to cook the noodles right. They are either too dry, or too floppy, or stuck together. These guys really seem to have it together. This was my first time eating here and I must say, Whitey is impressed.  Thank you, Lucky Thai :)",

I did have to ask our server a few times for a couple of things like napkins, an additional fork & spoon since there was 3 of us and the setting was for only 2 people. That was a given but who am I to tell her how to do her job. Wait no I can because I am the consumer. The food was good ... I had no problem with it except my husbands Beef Salad sauce was way too salty. I thought I was going to get a gout attack. I still think Archi's has the best Beef Salad in town. That's my opinion. Other than that the Pork Fried Rice I did for the Lunch Special was delicious. My Husband did the Spicy Basil Ground Beef & that was good too. Just don't get the Beef Salad & make sure to drink your water slowly because We had to constantly ask for a refill even though it was not that busy & there were only 2 other tables there.",

I love spicy food so I get spicy level 6 and that's where I want to be on my spice to flavor ratio!! You gotta go during their lunch specials too!!

The food was great - but the second time I went back, I let them know the 4 was too spicy for me and ordered a #1 in spiciness instead. I wasn't complaining - but they decided to take half off my meal this time as a gesture of good will.  Again, they came from behind the counter and shook my hand and saw me out.

The veggies were crisp, just how I like them, and the Tom Kha soup had the perfect portion of ingredients.  I will definitely come back. The best Thai food I've had in Vegas (and believe me, I've tried a lot).",

The 2 was just as spicy as the 4. I'd hate to see what an 8 is because our mouths were on fire with the 2 today. Other times I've had a heat level of 3 and it wasn't hot at all. So I don't know what to order because they aren't consistent with their own heat scale.",

Genuinely warm and friendly service (even the bus boy),  great food, and prices so low I actually felt guilty. Oh, and the portions were large! The green curry with chicken, my dish, was simple and delicious, as we're my wife's pineapple curry and my daughter's pad thai.  I've taken two Thai cooking classes at our local junior college and I can honestly say Lucki Thai is the real deal. We each ate two large helpings and brought home enough for lunch the next day. They even threw in extra sweet rice with the leftovers. All three dishes were $8.75!!",

It was perfectly sweet and spicy with tons more flavor than the same dish at Archi's. My husband ordered the basil beef and he was floored. That particular dish is what he's gotten sick from at Archi's (too much oil), but this dish sat perfectly with him and again was WAY more flavorful.

The tom kha hit the spot if you're into ginger and lemongrass, it had that yummy tangy taste. The yellow curry had a good consistency of chicken and potatoes. My husband and I were full with warm tummies and we still had leftover curry. Also, it cleared my sinuses lol.   For takeout our bill was about $18 including tip.

I've started coming at least twice a week, as I can't get enough...and especially now in the winter, nothing beats a nice cozy warm dinner. The service does lack a bit just because they overcharge for things they should just give, they don't communicate well, etc., but the food definitely makes up for it. Their most popular dish is the spicy basil, but I'd say it's my least favorite actually. I enjoy the Panang curry, Veggie delight, and chinese broccoli (all with chicken or shrimp I've had), BUT the chicken satay is the best I have had from anywhere. I'm not sure how they do it so incredibly, and their peanut sauce is out of this world as well is the cucumber salad...nothing better. I wish I could eat the satay & cucumber salad for every meal. I will definitely keep coming, but I may start taking out as the staff sort of bothers me a bit. Everything is so so authentic though, please give it a try if you're in the area!",

This restaurant fulfills my cravings for Thai food and I know that my family and the Vegas community can say the same.   My two top dishes I always order is the Pad Thai and Kung Pao (pork). The portions size is perfect: not too hefty, not too small. When it comes to the spice level of 1-10, they really do a great job of hitting the spot. I tried the lowest of lows to the scorching hot level 10. It just shows how they detailed they cater to each individual's order.   Both dine-in and delivery experience has been a breeze for my family & I. As for delivery, there is a $3.00 charge. Delivery time window is estimated 45-60 minutes but I usually get my order fast and early! If you would rather have them knock your door than ring the doorbell you can state so on the order form. My preference varies depending on who is inside my household and for them to never miss a beat on my additional instructions laminates the 5/5 for customer service!  Location: Located south of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch, this restaurant is snuggled between Island Pacific Market and the Integrity Taekwondo Studios. It's in the plaza where Jack in The Box and Dunkin' Doughnuts are at and there is plentiful of parking spaces upon entering.   I love this place and if you have enough room in your stomach for desserts, order the Sweet Rice & Mango!",

We ordered a large TOM YUM SOUP WITH TOFU at spice level 3 and it was huge and filling, though it was a little on the saltier side. Their spice level is also not that spicy for people who can take spice btw! I ordered the classic PAD SEE YEW (spice level 4) and mistakingly not it tasted how it should've. The portions are very big, practically two servings per order. We also ordered GREEN and YELLOW CURRY both at spice level 5 and not spicy. Both were very delicious and filling even for two starving adults.  We also ordered a THAI ICED TEA and it's good but a little on the sweeter side! The service was also very welcoming, they all greeted us with smiles and hellos right as we walked into the restaurant. Their english isn't perfect but that doesn't take away from anything other than just a slight little more time to communicate.   tldr; food 5/5 service 5/5",

One dish was too much to eat but I ate almost all of it and was full.    I know I didn't order the traditional Thai dish... but I ordered what I knew I liked at the time since it was lunch and I had to go back to work.    Next door is an Island seafood market.  I stopped in the day prior to browse around.  There was a lot of stuff I didn't recognize but it was definitely interesting.    Stop in Lucky Thai and grab something to eat, it's worth it.",

You can get whatever spice level works best for you including none-at-all which is what I prefer compared to my husband. They have great lunch specials and don't skimp on the serving sizes!

I ordered takeout and the lady that took my order on the phone was very friendly and helpful. Then when I arrived, all of the employees are so welcoming and friendly, the vibe and atmosphere of the little place is very hard to come by these days.   I got home and the food was just as amazing as the service was. And when you find a restaurant that has great service, that makes me want to come back there for just that. But the food was amazing too so I'm definitely going to be back. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai spicy level 5 and the Green curry spicy level 5. Pad Thai was amazing, curry was good but I wish I got that one with spice level 0 cause I feel like the spice makes it taste a bit different. At least different than green curry that I had before. But either was good is great, I definitely recommend the Pad Thai.   Great place, very small inside, probably not suitable for huge parties but lunch or dinner with a few friends to eat in is perfect. One of my fav Thai restaurants in town. Definitely will be coming here when I don't want to wait in long lines to eat Pho Kim Long. Great place, love it !!!",

The dipping sauce was sweet and good, too.  I asked for the yellow curry to be veggie only (no meat or tofu). Luckily they have that option right in the order menu on yelp. It was packed full of veggies and had an excellent flavor.  The veggie delight had only veggies and was in a light sauce. It, too, was very yummy. There was a lot of this dish and I enjoyed it for lunch the following day.  I don't know the breakdown of how much rice came with which dish, but the meal came with plenty of rice.   I am, in fact, ordering from them again tonight because it was so good and I don't have to cook or go anywhere.",

The wait staff were very short with me when asking about the food and not very attentive. The front of house was fine except a glaring view of their \"junk hallway\" as Im calling it is in plain view. All of their spare freezers, racks and miscellaneous extra kitchen crap all right their. Not a big deal if the food was good but just a general eye sore. We only ordered both the red and green curry. So thats all I can attest to. Both were fine but lacked any real Thai curry flavor and tasted somewhat watered down. The sauces for both were very thin and as others attested sweet and somewhat bland. We ordered a level 4 spicy which would burn at my other spot but is barely noticeable at all here. I wouldnt recommend this spot. There are far better Thai spots in Vegas. Ive even made better myself. It deserves a 2.5 but 5 always rounds up so thats what they are getting.",

The only trouble we had was communicating our order to them over the phone. English was definitely not the first language with whom we were speaking to. Making it difficult to get our order correct. Thankfully the post mate person called us to make sure our order was correct.   We ordered:  Chicken Pad Thai - So good!  Chicken Pad See Ewe - Bomb  Chicken Pad see Mao - Really good!  Chicken Green Curry - Bomb!  Chicken Pineapple Curry - Fire  Duck Panang - Good!  Pineapple Fried Rice - bomb  Sticky rice - so good  Honey Toast - The best!  Fried Bananas - Soooo good!!!  Green tea ice cream - bomb  Coconut ice cream - Fire  Overall, amazing place for Thai. Especially takeout. Definitely a must try!",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this restaurant through Yelp, and had dinner yesterday evening. My mom and I were greeted by the staff and were promptly seated.   First thing I noticed was the placemats and booth seats are a bit worn down. Not a big deal, because the main focus is on the food. Their menu isn't too extensive, and most entree prices are based around what protein (or veggie) option you choose. I wasn't feeling too hungry, so my mom and I split a panang curry with salmon dish, and also ordered an order of chicken satay. We wanted to order some rice to go with the curry, but the waiter told us the curry came with a bowl of rice. We asked to order another bowl, but he recommended that we wait for the dish to come out first and see if we needed more rice from there. I definitely appreciate that he wanted to make sure we didn't over order and subsequently pay more. That left a really good impression on me, and it seems like they really care about their customers.  Anyway, the chicken satay came out first. The chicken skewers are laid on a bed of shredded green cabbage, and it comes with a tiny side of pickled cucumbers, shredded carrots, shredded green and purple lettuce, and thinly sliced red onions. The chicken satay also has a small cup of cool peanut sauce. I tried the chicken satay first without the sauce, and was a bit surprised that it had a thin layer of satay sauce. I've noticed that most other Thai restaurants have more of the chicken just rolled in satay seasonings, but not a sauce. I really enjoyed that because it was more flavorful with the sauce. After trying the chicken with the peanut sauce, it was even better! The peanut sauce is rich and very flavorful. The side of pickled cucumber salad was a good, refreshing balance to the heavier chicken satay and peanut sauce.  The panang curry with salmon came out with a full bowl of rice and I think it was enough for me to share for a small meal. You may need another bowl of rice if you're sharing and want to have a comfortable rice to curry ratio. The panang curry came with a large piece of salmon, and I didn't care too much about the salmon because it was a bit dry, and it wasn't really seasoned, other than the curry that topped it, so I ended up breaking up the salmon and mixing it around in the curry. I'd probably go for chicken or beef next time. The veggies in the curry included some bell peppers, carrots, cabbage, and a few pieces of broccoli. It seems like they have some steamed vegetables and pour the curry over, because the broccoli was not completely covered in the curry when the dish arrived. For the amount of curry we had, I wished there was a bit more veggies, so I would probably order extra veggies for $2 for this dish specifically or just replace the salmon with veggies. This dish was $12.95 for the salmon as the protein, but I believe if you opt for veggies, it would be $8.95, which seems like a better deal for a veggie dish. As for the curry sauce, it had a bit of the peanut sauce taste, which I really enjoyed, and I think it made the curry heartier! Very good!  Service was overall fantastic and friendly--both waiter and waitress working that night checked on us a few times to see if we were ready to order, to refill our water cups, and to make sure everything was okay with us.   Overall, solid place for Thai food--I would definitely come back!",

I had the taste for yellow curry and decided to place a \"take out\" order from Lucky Thai.   I ordered yellow curry, spice level 5, garlic pepper chicken, won ton soup, cucumber salad and a house salad. I was IMPRESSED with the flavor of the food. It was delicious! Just my kind of joint....low key, family owned and freshly cooked food. Honestly, I have to rate each dish a 10. It was that good folks!   Upon picking up my order, I was greeted professionally with a smile and enthusiasm. I arrived home and noticed everything was packaged to carefully. Nothing was missing. After eating dinner, I had enough food for one day of leftovers. After heating up the food the following day, the food was STILL good!!!!!! Wow!!!!! I will be eating here regularly. Prices are very reasonable too!  Don't sleep on this establishment. REAL GOOD FOOD HERE :-)",

I found this place through a Yelp search and was sold on all the other great reviews. We walked in to a small joint but with only two open tables so I was happy we were able to grab a seat.   We were greeted promptly, put in an order for wings, chicken panang, veggie pad Thai and cucumber salad.   The panang was so good!! The best I've had in town. The sauce was a good amount full of sweet and spicy flavors of coconut milk and curry, the chicken was incredibly tender and over a bed of warm rice made it amazing. We could have eaten two plates.   The pad Thai was also full of flavor, tons of fresh veggies and the perfect tangy sweet sauce. The portion was so large we took half or it home.   We couldn't leave without some mango sticky rice and it was the best I have ever had! Tons of fresh mango, sweet sticky rice topped with sesame seeds and a sugary salty sauce. So so good!   The service here was so wonderful. The staff was incredibly attentive, kind and helpful with recommendations. They continuously cleared our plates, refilled our waters and the food was all brought out in a timely manner. I look forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "So they place is totally outta my neighborhood in the valley, but I happened to just be on this side of town today and had bookmarked this place based off another yelper's review, so I decide why not check it out since I'm in the area.   Located in the Fresh and Easy plaza off of Silverado Ranch, the place is easy to miss if you're not familiar with the area (I was able to find coz of the yelp address and Siri ) the inside is quite small and has a quaint type feel to it. Definitely gives off a \"this is where you go to have quick sit down lunch\" type feel verses somewhere that I would want to sit down for dinner. They have a big banner outside advertising their lunch special as well, but just the inside screams lunch type dining verses the dinner type atmosphere.   Unfortunately, I walked in after their lunch special times so I missed out on that, but the prices were reasonable so definitely not the place that'll put a dent in your wallet. Anytime I try a new Thai place, I go for what I know the best, Pad Thai, Thai beef jerky, sticky rice, crab Ragoon, or curries. So here I went for the ragoons and pad Thai.   The ragoons were small and cute, but there was too much taste of just cream cheese like it was very sweet, too sweet for my pallet. Like no green onions or carrot or seasoning to off balance or blend in the cream cheese. Just for me it was too sweet.   Now for the Pad Thai, I was extremely disappointed coz it was good but just didn't taste like Pad Thai, it tasted more Pad See Eew or Lad Na... Like had more soy sauce taste like the sauces were cooked in the same pan :/ I was just eating and it was good like I said but just really didn't taste like Pad Thai at all.   The place is a bit cluttered in the back towards where the bathroom is... They could do better making it more presentable. I'm down to give this place another try if I'm in the area, but def not somewhere I will drive out to get. Sticking to Archi Thai and Original Thai BBQ on jones",

I really don't care for raw veggies and they cook these in the rice still firm but not crunchy.  PERFECT!  Well, the last time the veggies were not cooked as usual and they were crunchy.  I was disappointed in the dish.  I went back again tonight and ordered the rice and told them about the previous experience and how specifically I wanted the veggies.  I didn't get what I ordered.  The server misunderstood somehow what I ordered and I got crunchy veggies.  So I called.  The owner COMPLETELY made the situation right!  This is a business with integrity and a True focus on customer service.  If you call and report respectfully that something wasn't right or let your server know, they care about servicing their customers and making them happy.  In addition, they just have really great food!  You should make this place a regular stop.  Most places just care about getting your money these days.  Not this place.  Thanks Chin.",

When you order your food they will ask how spicy you want it, if you're not good with heat, definitely aim low; if you're ok with smoke blowing out of your ears, go high. I had basil duck with a medium level of spice and that was almost all I could bare, but that's subjective based on your taste buds. Heat aside,the duck was seared well and not dry at all. The flavor of the meat was earthy, savory, and sweet like citrus. I am excited to return and try more items on their diverse menu.",

    "text": "Oh my god.  Another 5 star review?!?!?!?!? I can't believe it. Two in one week.We came here randomly on a Friday night after seeing all the awesome reviews here. The location is a bit hard to find, it is inside of a small shopping complex and appears to be a small hole in the wall. It sure was! As it only has about 6/7 tables in the whole place. The girl that works their most of the time is super friendly and nice, greets you right away and tries to get you seated as soon as possible.   Their menu is very simple, and very traditional.  We started with curry puffs which were basically curry samosas and were delicious. For dinner I have the Pad See Ew which I can honestly say is probably one of the best I have had in my lifetime, and I just got back from Thailand. I will go back even just for that! My  boyfriend had the spicy basil entree which was good but not as good as mine! For dessert we had the friend bananas with vanilla and coconut ice cream. This was life changing, seriously. I can't wait to return to this place and eat the food all over again.   Overall I was really impressed by so many things at this place, attentive service, quality and inexpensive yet delicious food, coziness, friendliness of the staff, and really one of the best thai restaurant experiences I have had ever in Las Vegas. Well done Lucki Thai, we will be back!!",

In Naam Tok the pork chunks were too thick and tasted boiled.  There was no hint of lime and zero mint leaves which generally are added to these dishes. I'm ok with them having a different recipe, but at least make it flavorful. The egg rolls were reasonably good.  Seafood Salad $15, had several pieces of squid, few mussels, and few shrimps.  The shrimp were large.  Seafood was cooked perfectly, but again, the flavors didn't come together and it was just bland.  Onion pieces were cut too big and were larger than seafood itself.  Very disappointing.",

But when I ordered honey toast for my friend and I to share, we were told that it would take about 10-15 minutes for it to be made... We were fine with that.... 10 minutes has passed and the waitress came back to our table and said it would take 10 more minutes for the honey toast to be done. We were like ok I guess! Bout 7 minutes or so of waiting another waitress told us it would be another 10 minutes. So if your counting, we nearly waited almost close to 30 minutes for our honey toast!  When we finally got it it was kinda hard and the bottom of the toast was completely black! Burnt to be exact! (See photo added).  We were really disappointed... Our waitress came around and asked us if everything was ok? We asked her if the toast was supposed to be burnt and black? She responded by saying \" its toast it suppose to be burnt and you don't eat the bottom part of the honey toast!\" We told her that we never seen honey toast look like that before. All she responded with was \"sorry, I don't know what to say!\" she just looked at us all dumbfounded.  I really wanted to enjoy the honey toast.... I was frustrated because the whole meal was good and the dessert was such a disappointment! Btw, I was still charged for the honey toast after I voiced my concerns about it.... I don't like writing bad reviews but I had to put it out there!",

I ordered pot stickers, thai beef jerky, shrimp tom yum soup, and spicy basil beef with tofu level 3.   When I order at a new thai place, I always start low on the spice scale to really test it out.   The pot stickers were awesome, really good spicy sauce to accompany. The thai beef jerky was okay, I've had better. The spicy basil with tofu was great. Lots of tofu, cabbage, onion, and most important, lots of basil. It wasn't too spicy at all, I could have gone for a 5 or even 6. It came with a side of white sticky rice which was cooked very well, not mushy and no hard peices.   The tom yum soup was great too. No complaints there. The delivery was also SUPER fast.   All in all. With tax, delivery charge, it came to about 40 bucks.   Worth it.",

Pork lard na was disappointed, the pork was very tough. Thai tea was okay but Thai coffee was not good. Overall I will come back.",

We had deliciously fresh calamari, fried tofu, chicken lettuce wrap, shrimp tom yum soup, shrimp fried rice, and mixed veges with tofu. They were so delicous and freshly made. The size of the shrimps are huge. We love our waiter, Chin. He is attentive, courteous, polite and he has very friendly smiles. The food feels just like home made and the service made us feel like family. We were on a short weekend getaway so we made it to the point that we visit again before we leave. This is truly a hidden gem in Vegas. We definitely recommend this restaurant.",

Crab Rangoon nothing but cream cheese for the most part. Hubby's Red Curry was pretty good, but for a spiciness of 4, it was less spicy than my pad thai. Pretty disappointed first time out, but they only get one chance so....maybe Thai House up the street next time.",
