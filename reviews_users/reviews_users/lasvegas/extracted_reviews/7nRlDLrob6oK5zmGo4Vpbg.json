The cheese they used in it would have been better if it was cheddar cheese. They used sliced sand which cheese. They did the same for the omelette my son ordered. He wasn't impressed either. The pancakes were good. Next time I'm in Vegas I will try them again to see if we just made poor ordering choices.",

I like the cozy environment of a diner here plus they have a nice mini bar you can get cocktails and food to eat as well. They offer plenty of cakes and bakery options and also one unique thing is they make there own fudge which is great if you have a sweet tooth! Prices are moderate. Staff is very friendly even on late night shifts. Big portions.",

My wife and I both agree that the griddle items were the best we have ever had! Everything was better than average. While the food was very good, the service was less than average and nothing to write home about. They filled the glass with ice so you could get three sips of water and you had an empty glass, THEN, it say empty for 15 minutes. It may have just been our server. She seemed a little scattered, writing down the table number wrong on the ticket so the food was almost delivered to the wrong table, and forgetting what our drinks were not even two minutes after she asked us. A disappointing way to bring down a restaurant's rating when their food was damn good! SMH.",

I've long been a fan of the fruit compote pancakes, and the pancakes here are always absolutely massive, around 7\" dia. Fluffy, not needlessly sweet on their own, and superb with blueberries baked inside.  Understandably, mileage may vary, but I can't recall having a bad experience with the service here.  This place used to be a Marie Callender's, so rather than the neon blue glow that is characteristic of the other Blueberry Hill restaurants, you'll find that the country home aesthetic still remains.",

You can also order them grilled which added an extra dimension to their already delicious muffins.  The topping on the muffin tops are so good.  Apple pancakes also very good and you get A LOT of them!  Light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweet.  The only weird thing I found was that they serve the cooked and raw apples with the rinds on.  It didn't really add any value to the apple taste.  The cheese burger was very good too.  They boast never frozen, 100% angus beef.  Whatever it was, it was juicy and flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I do wish they seasoned it more, however, I guess they need to cater to a broad spectrum of tastes.  When we left, I noticed their display for ribs.  THEY SERVE IT ON A BAKING SHEET!!! Whoa!

I didn't get what I ordered or how I ordered it, I asked to have one poached egg added to one of the quarters of my chicken and waffles, it came without it, and after I asked her she brought one poached egg in a cup full of water, I tried to scoop it to put in on top of my chicken because I didn't want all that water on my dish but I was impossible, it ended up bursting in the water.  The manager noticed and immediately told her to bring me a new dish.  My husband was almost done with his breakfast by then.  My new dish came but my mimosa failed to come until the end of my meal.  The food is ok, some items like my husband's are pretty good, but I guess service depends on who you get.",

She's in touch with her customers and engaged. This place is an upgraded version to a classic spot. Tv's all over the place. No neighborhood feel",

    "text": "This is their newest location. I think it's also their best. Why? Well because there is a bar in this one. You can order drinks or sit at the bar (breakfast mimosas!) and watch tv during your meal. This location is not far from the strip.  I grew up on the deliciousness that is Blueberry Hill. It honestly was a staple of my childhood here in Vegas. I've never had a bad meal or had anything I did not like.  Breakfast is usually where I stay at on the menu. I've had lunch and I've had dinner. Both also good, the breakfast is what brings me back. Especially since it's offered 24/7. Their pancakes are the BEST in town hands down. Made from scratch, not a box. Served with warm syrup and real whipped butter. It's carb heaven. I'm also in love with their thick cut delicious sourdough toast. It pairs with everything from a BLT to dipping in my eggs over easy.  The menu ranges from traditional breakfast options, Mexican breakfast and all kinds of great sugar stuff. You know waffles and stuffed French toast. Then there is lunch and dinner options. And if you hadn't noticed on your walk through the entrance, they do homemade desserts that make you wanna lick the window they're being shown off in.  Seating options are booth, tables and chairs, 1//2 booth 1/2 table & chairs or the bar. So they a good for large parties too.",

Over all a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back.",

I've given this location a few chances and it just sucks. The last time was the worst. We came in at night around 11 pm and 4 employees were at the front and all of them were on their phones and ignoring us, they definitely noticed we were there but just stood and looked at us and didn't acknowledge us nor seat us or get someone to seat us. What horrible service! Our orders came out wrong, the food was bland. Won't be going to this location again. Don't waste your time at this location.",

Food is decent if not better than other breakfast places out there. Get the Truck Stop meatloaf special, the crepes, or any variety of pancakes. You can't go wrong. Location is where the old Marie Callendars once was. I like this place as a weekday destination.   One thing I find very strange is that they NEVER give you a receipt when you pay with cash. If you ask for a receipt they have to go in the back to make one up for you. Why don't they have cash registers that can print out receipts for cash paying customers? Why the hassle?

The customer service was not as great as i expected compared to other locations. Our waitress was not friendly until we started complaining about the food. And speaking of the food, it was not appetizing at all! The preparation just looked like rubbish. My father ordered the Bonanza Breakfast with ham, but when we got our food, the ham was burnt hard, so of course we got it replaced, and the second time it came out there was just a bunch of burnt char on it. Also for their french toast, it was not even cooked, it was soggy and still raw i couldn't even eat it. Very unprofessional and unacceptable to serve something like that. For a great word of mouth restaurant, i was absolutely disappointed. This might be my first and last visit.",

I had the Chicken fried chicken (but grilled) and he had the Ham and cheese omelette. Man man man the food is to die for. Although I'm not a big eater and I'm very particular when it comes to food. I must say EVERYTHING WAS FANTASTIC; the Service, the food and the atmosphere!!! Did I mention the pancakes were unbelievable!! The best I've ever had. I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

The server we had took 20 minutes to take our order then brought out our food and had us wait another 5 minutes for our toast, didn't check on our drinks and when she did ask she never brought me more coffee, at the end I asked for a water and that took another 5 minutes. It was the server we had because before then my bf asked for another OJ and the server who we asked brought it immediately. I am not one to review places with bad feedback but I found it really annoying. Oh and let me say it was not busy at all she was in charge of 3 tables then at the end 4 .",

She was extremely helpful in answering our questions and made sure our visit was perfect. So many wonderful items on the menu - I wish I could try them all! This is why I'll be coming back again and again. Potato pancakes were delicious! The country potatoes were so soft and tasty with Ranch dressing. Not too much seasoning and not bland. We didn't wait long either - for a holiday that is awesome. I like that the servers all help each other. They seemed to get along - at least in the public's view and that didn't go unnoticed.  I invite you to try this place - it's worth it in my opinion. So many different and unique dishes to try. Don't pass up the to die for desserts in the case to your left as you walk in.",

    "text": "I haven't been to a Blueberry Hill in about 8 years, and after our visit on Sunday, I'm really not sure why we have waited so long to go back.    We decided to start the New Year off right, with a delicious breakfast with friends.   We arrived at about 10am, right before the big rush.  There was no wait.   The restaurant has a huge waiting area right up front.  Probably the biggest waiting area I've seen since Mimi's Cafe.   Its well lit, and very clean.    Our server was phenomenal.  I really wish I'd jotted down her name.  She was friendly.  Prompt. Super nice.  She double checked our orders, and kept our coffee cups full.   Shall I mention the PLETHORA of flavored creamers she brought out for us?  I've never had a place bring so many before, and I use a lot, so this was perfect.  I know its odd, but I love the mugs that they served the coffee in.  I have a thing for mugs, and there's just something comforting about a big, thick, sturdy mug.  They have them for sale here, and I just might have to come back and buy one.    The food was really good too.   My fella and I ordered:  The Eggs Benedict Florentine (Eggs Benedict with no Canadian bacon, with mushrooms and spinach) with a side of potato pancakes instead of regular potatoes or fruit. (Small upcharge.  Totally worth it.) The Waitress Special:  an 8 oz ham steak with 2 eggs (over medium for hubby) and a Belgian waffle.    I didn't try my husband's eggs and ham, as I REALLY dislike ham.  He loved it though.  I did, however, steal a bite of his waffle, and it was absolute perfection.    MY meal was delicious.  I absolutely adore eggs benedict, and I only get to eat it maybe twice a year.  The eggs were poached perfectly.  The hollandaise was creamy and delightful, and everything was seasoned well.    My potato pancakes were delightful.  Served with sour cream and applesauce, they were light and delicate.  A touch underseasoned, but I'd rather they be underseasoned than over.  They were spectacular.    I definitely plan to go back again.  And this time, I won't wait for 8 years.",

Wife had cinnamon swirl pancakes and it was huge. Four large pancakes covered with a sweet icing like the cinnamon buns you get in the can. Wife ate 2 and took 2 home. Service was excellent, always filling the coffee and water glasses. Present without hovering. Will definitely go back",

Today I had the Wild West omelette, served open faced with hash browns and toast.  If it is meat and cheese you crave, this is it, lots of diced ham and cheddar!   My husband got the dealers special, eggs scrambled, choice of meat, he gets the ham steak, hash browns and toast. The ham steak is a generous portion, grilled and smoked.   Because we both love pancakes, we added the cinnamon pancakes! The are so good. The cakes are light and fluffy, sprinkled in cinnamon and drizzled with a powder sugar icing. Just enough sugar to put you in a coma for the rest of the day!  Our server today is Maria, we often have her and she is always on it, brings us refills, often remembering our drink orders even before we sit down! As always, service is great, friendly and fast.   If you want homemade desserts, they also have many pies and cakes to choose from.  I've had a slice of their cakes, one day, I'll order a whole cake, perhaps the orange cake, or maybe the chocolate, or the ... oh, so many to pick from.",

My usual go to at Blueberry HIll is the french toast combo. It comes with two slices of delicious french toast, two eggs and hashbrowns. This is all for under $10!   Their pancakes are also great. Love the apple cinnamon compote pancakes or fresh strawberry pancakes.  Service is great.   Definitely come by if you don't want to get ripped off by Strip pricing.",

I order the chilaquiles (probably was my first mistake) as soon as I took a bite of the chips they were stale. The only thing that taste good to me was the eggs; I ask the waiter of I could remove the chilaquiles because the chips were too stale for me to eat. He proceeded to lie to me about the chips being freshly cut and pulled out a thermostat to prove to me that he checks the temperature of the chips that were served to me. I was taught the customer is always right; Donald proved to me that he is more concern  with being right then a repeat customer. On a good note my boyfriend loves his food. Only complaint he had was they do not offer alternatives for pork like turkey bacon or sausage.",

    "text": "So we pull into the former Marie Callendars last night and thought we'd give this place a try as we hadn't had breakfast for dinner in quite some time. Well after sitting in a dirty dusty booth I immediately regretted my decision but my kid said mom come on don't be like that.   Anyhow we ordered cheese stuff French toast with fruit and the Triple 4.    First off their sausage links for charging more then a Denny's or IHOP which I never go to , are disgusting.  There is no meaty quality they are soft , mushy and a slight grayish color.  The bacon thin crispy salty of low quality and he eggs were just whatever.  Well my spikey red haired waitress I called her over to show her my pancake was pure batter in the middle and she takes my whole plate with eggs and all on it back to the kitchen I was absolutely shocked , disgusted and puzzled.  Wtf you see the pancake is messed up ! Wtf why did you take my whole plate with my food to the back then bring it back out had me scrape my food and take the batter pancake back? Made absolutely zero sense   So she has two more pancakes made without even asking me what I wanted to do. The biting of the battery pancake was revolting and left me feeling putrid all night    She then says \"O honey I understand I'm not mad at you\" are you freakin kidding me ? Mad at me ? For what for being victim for your over priced horrid food.  I have half the mind to call the health department because I guarantee things need to be cleaned up back there   I quickly threw cash on the table and bolted out taking the two freshly made pancakes with us.  We have them to a homeless guy closer towards Decatur.   Seriously Denny or iHop has much better quality food and service.  How about next time your client goes chomping unknowingly on a uncooked pancake leaving a batter disgusting mess in their mouth you don't make them pay for that crap. I'm still upset this morning and I feel sick now.    That French toast thing the cream cheese on the inside was lumpy and tasteless and the whole toast was covered in powdered sugar   Icing I ate it just to get the damn moment of the pancake out of my mouth and I'm regretting it over and over now.   You will get better quality meat and eggs anywhere  se McDonald's Burger King anywhere.  You tourists who want breakfast and don't go here go to a casino where the food is good quality and the servers actually know how to treat customers and amped situations and have customer service not just thirsty for a higher tip.    I had such a moronic waitress I'm really going to give them a mouthful today !   The corporate office said they were going to refund my money but here we are almost two weeks later and nothing. Thanks for the lies",

I ordered the honey coconut chicken and waffles and some shredded hash browns. The portions were very generous and food came fast and hot.  The waffles were big & fluffy with just the right crunch. Hash browns were cooked good. The chicken is chicken breast vs bone in pieces which I think would work better but it was tasty. The coconut flavor wasn't overpowering which I liked because I'm not a big fan of coconut. They have a big menu, all I looked at were breakfast items. I'll definitely come back to try some other stuff.",

I think I was better off just going to Denny's but I wanted to try something new so I don't think I will be going back there again.",

They are very rude, unprofessional, and slow. My honey and I like Blueberry late at night and every time we come in (anytime between 11-2) the male greeter/server who works that shift, ALWAYS tells us the reason they are slow is because of a cook shift change. So it takes 3 hours for a shift change? I don't think so!!! One horrible experience with him was, he had the nerve to write my order down incorrectly, so when I got home and realized I did not have my liquid crack, I had to drive all the way back. He had the nerve to come outside (as I'm re-waiting for my food) and argue with me about what I ordered. Ugh...he is the reason this location receives 2 stars. We do not eat it as often anymore because of him.",

Then she said the machine didn't work and asked for it again. We told her never mind and hung up.

I've only tried the Oreo cake, which if you love Oreos or cookies and cream, will satisfy your sweet cravings. I have tried their breakfast there and I would have to say it's an average breakfast of omelettes and breakfast meats.

After perusing the multi-page menu I decided on breakfast. The waitress accepted my substitution with a smile (four sausage instead of two sausage, two bacon) and although it took a while to come it did not disappoint. Well-done eggs, sausage as requested, solid fluffy pancakes with heft and flavor.   Service top notch, food as well. Worth a return trip and seeing as they're open 24 hours, they'll be ready when I come back.",

My boyfriend & I had been looking forward to finally eating here on our last day in Vegas. We ordered the usual pancakes, bacon, eggs & after waiting about 20 minutes our waitress came back to tell us the kitchen lost our ticket & she'd have to retake our order (which she couldn't even remember). And what was her manager going to give us in return...free coffee. How about you take care of our meal that we'll have to wait another 20 minutes for??? Customer service here is beyond subpar, I suggest finding a place that can at least get your order through to the kitchen.",

The bacon was a nice size not see-through and nicely crisp, the potatoes were deep-fried which I didn't like as I thought they were going to be like home fries.  The eggs were decently cooked but I said soft scrambled and they had a little brown on them but they were okay now the big problem my blueberry compote syrup had two white hairs in it which got in my mouth and I had to pull them out which is disgusting so I did not eat my pancakes so they need to tell someone to wear a hairnet but for the price it was a good value a good amount of food and other than the potatoes being frozen crap that they fried and the hairs in my compote syrup I would consider a good value. My sister had an omelet and it was two meals, plenty and lots of meat she said it was good, art for $30 I still would not eat pancakes with hairs in them.",

Right when we got up to leave, someone asked if we'd like drinks, it was too late. We were too pissed and hungry to deal with it.   Then the hostess said sorry and held the door open as we left.",

Asked the waitress what was going on she gave us the run around saying that they were still waiting for it to come out.  I spoke to the manager Steve he said he apologized for the inconvenience that there had been some sort of confusion in the kitchen but apparently no one could clarify what the confusion was.  Our original waitress was Chelsea and the one came to explain everything was named Felicia she said that Chelsea didn't even want to come out for being so embarrassed. The manager Steve only offered to cut the bill in half which honestly was not good enough for me.  It's one thing to mess up but it's another to let your customers sit there without explanation. I'm sure If we hadn't complained they woulda let us sit there longer.   This was my first and last visit to the restaurant. The food was good when we finally got it but we didn't even get to enjoy it because our experience had already been ruined.",

Even though it wasn't cooked to my liking it wasn't tough and it was still flavorful. The pancakes (OMG!) some of the best if not THE BEST pancakes I've ever had!! They were light and fluffy and HUGE!! The portion sizes are huge and although i was starving i needed a to go box. My friend had the sausage , egg and apple pancakes. There were no complaints from his side of the table. Next time i come to Vegas, I'll be back!",

Keep in mind this was at 11:30am on a weekday when the place was half empty:  - waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated despite only one party in front of us and tons of empty tables - waited more than 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order (we were ready to order food, but he told us he couldn't take food orders and would get someone) - waited another 10 minutes before we were able to flag down someone else to take our food order - waited nearly 40 minutes more for our food to arrive  To top it off, our order was messed up in multiple ways (wrong type of toast, eggs cooked wrong, missing hash browns), and when we asked to complain to a manager, we were left waiting long enough that we just decided to pay the bill and leave. The only possible explanation I can have for my experience is that servers and staff here are not trained well and management just doesn't care. It's a real shame, as I generally prefer the food at Blueberry Hill to other chains.",

Located on a busy corner, with a parking lot nearly filled to capacity by 9:00am though the enormous restaurant was only perhaps 2/3 full, it was with the first of several cups of 100% Arabica coffee that the meal began and with bold flavor and a smooth finish one must say this is an area where Blueberry Hill excels, a statement no less justified in describing the 'limited' run of Blueberry Muffins, baked fresh each day and served warm with a streusel top and sidecar of butter, quick to sell out and \"gone when they're gone.\"  Having sampled the Monte Cristo and Oreo Pancakes on a prior visit to the Decatur location it was once again in two entrees that appetite was invested and with a rich buttermilk recipe handed down since 1966 the supple texture of a 3-stack of pancakes was only improved by smooth whipped cream and a handful of melting chocolate chips, a chocolate fudge drizzle requested in place of the included syrup making things all the more decadent at absolutely no additional charge.  Moving next to something somewhat savory, suffice it to say that Blueberry Hill's Chicken and Waffles is nothing like that which one will find down South, yet having watched a young line-cook hand batter each strip in the kitchen, roll it in coconuts, and then toss it in a fryer the attention to detail was appreciated as each piping hot piece paired nicely to a pliable golden waffle well suited to soak up a drizzle of honey and plenty of butter soaked in the same.  At this point happily sated, but with a long wait at the car dealership ahead, it was with two slices of cake made in the on-site bakery that I took my leave and although the carrot cake was dry, spongy, and almost entirely devoid of flavor aside from sweetness from the cream cheese icing the Blueberry Crumb cake was a masterful composition with moist yellow cake, buttery crumbles, and bursting blueberries beneath bright blue frosting that tasted surprisingly natural, and not overly sweet.  A bit more expensive than chains such as IHOP, but obviously committed to using better ingredients and taking extra steps to assure customer satisfaction, Blueberry Hill remains one of Las Vegas' best 24/7 locally owned stops - the sort of place I'd probably never eat dinner, but one where breakfast is never a bad choice.",

    "text": "One of the challenges when you come with your family is finding an affordable place for breakfast. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all the Strip Buffet's and fine dinning but sometimes your just not in the mood for all the \"extra\" aka waiting, driving, etc.. so having a place like Blueberry Hill off the strip and near our hotel (walking distance) was ideal.   Its a traditional breakfast restaurant with a lot of options (can be good or can be bad) but you know it will carry the staples from Pancakes, French Toast, Waffles, Omelettes, sandwiches, soups,.... you get the point. Excellent food and breakfast was consistent with what we expected. Our selections of food varied from the Waffle w/coconut Chicken, Chocolate chip pancakes (lots of chocolate chips), spaghetti, and Tender Pork Loins with a few sides. Again, we were all over the place but everyone was happy.   When ordering, ask questions and don't expect it to be the same thing you got back in you home town at the local breakfast spot. For example, it comes with sausage... is it a link or a patty, is it port or beef... is it fried or panko covered, what's in the salad, can i get it on the side... you get the point.   Over server was cool and kept the refills of water and soda's coming. They have a great selection of desserts to choose from when your getting ready to leave (mainly cakes). Given our proximity to our hotel off of Flamingo, we would definitely come back as they have plenty of options for the pickiest of person's.",

Today was a particularly slower day in the morning which was nice, no wait and quick ordering. The menu is pretty vast, breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts.... whew! About 8 or 9 pages to it. All kinds of breakfast selections pancakes, waffles, omelettes the list goes on.  As you walk in you are greeted with a waiting area in the lobby and a specials board (mimosas & bloody marys were on that board today) as well as a grand display of cakes and pies See my photos to see what was in todays case! Mmmmm. Carrot cake!!!!  The dining room has lots of seatings for small or large groups as well as an old school diner style seating at the counter. As we were sat the dining room wasnt too crowded which is a good sign, fast food! Instead of looking at the menu we opted for the specials today. Real simple! 2 Mini waffles w/eggs and sausage ($8.99) for my little and a spinach and cheese omelette add bacon (+$1.69) (total $9.99) Everything came out quick along with my coffee and OJand my little was satisfied with her chocolate milk ($3.09 and no refills) dang!!! Thats okay she was pleased especially with that whipped cream for her waffles   The service is always good when we come no complaints. Today was slower then normal so expect a waittime on the weekends.   Love Blueberry Hill!!!!!",

Good coffee, attentive and friendly staff, large portions, and delicious food. Prices aren't that cheap but hey, we don't go out for breakfast every day! My husband got the chicken and waffles and they were superb, they looked so good I just had to steal a bite. I got the vegetable fajitas with all the fixins including guacamole and beans and rice and roasted jalapenos. If we ever are wanting to treat ourselves for breakfast again, this will be our first choice :)",

The restaurant set up a large table for the hostess to use for a dessert table.  Blueberry Hill has its own bakery, but management was gracious enough to allow her to bring a \"special baby girl\" cake.  The party hostess and management selected a list of 12 entrees for the guests to choose from for dinner. (The restaurant's regular menu is HUGE with wide range of prices; often difficult to make decisions on a selection.)  This allowed for preferences but was time-saving.  The serving staff were prompt, polite, kept our drinks filled and, when done eating, tables cleared.  The guest of honor, the party hostess and others were very happy with the event.  We will use their private room again for other meetings and parties, after this pleasant experience.  Sincerely,  Haze K.",

Service is very efficient, got water and coffee right away and it was refilled very quickly.  Now the yummm part. Have to admit, the BEST WAFFLES AND PANCAKES. Waffle is crisped to perfection and their home made butter on top... mmmmmm.. pancakes are so fluffy and flavorful. They make it look real fun for kids, my kids pancake pic attached :) When was the last time you had a great side of toast at a breakfast place? I can't praise their toast enough lol, perfect temperature, so buttery and crisp! My kids even raved about how good the bacon and sausage was.  Highly recommend, this is going to be our new fav bfast place. They serve lunch and dinner too.",

I get to work, open the bag... first of all there was NO hash browns, second I go to eat my waffle. It was completely Soggy and a little warm. OBVIOUSLY, it was NOT made fresh. I work in the service industry. I would never send soggy, not freshly made food with my customer. Completely unprofessional, I will never again order food from Blueberry Hill.",

I can't speak for any other items on the menu, aside for the breakfast options; which are pretty basic in my opinion.... so you can't really mess up lol.   Today I ordered the Tennessee fried steak and eggs, with a side of chunky potatoes extra crispy (of course)!!! Steak was 6.5/10 for me, it wasn't very fried; but I didn't really mind. The parts that were fried ended up being super soggy. So I stay stick to the 10oz sirloin.   The omelettes are huge too! And always come out 8-9/10. Can't go wrong.  I frequent this place when I'm in Vegas because my boyfriend's family loves this place. No complaints here.",

Particularly the Flamingo and Decatur location. Not all of the staff is great, but we can name a few that definitely make the experience way better! The bussers work their tails off, Martin you are awesome! And Norma, Chelsea, and Marvi, you are the few waitresses that place cannot do without! The food is good, but the people can really make or break the business. We love their homemade soups, chicken noodle and the meatball soup are the best! Their chicken parmesan is a classic, but I enjoy the crispy chicken without the sauce, the sauce can be a bit bland to those who eat without salt, but im sure if you add a dash it might be better. Regardless, I always enjoy the dish. Their honey coconut chicken is a must! And so are their pancakes!!! And their french toast too! You must try them with a side of ice cream! Yum!!! The only downside to eating here is the \"itis\" at the end...the \"food coma,\" if you must...but definitely worth it.",

I arrive at around 10:30 and surprisingly beat the morning brunch crowd, which was a big plus! Our server, Jessica had some really appetizing recommendations. One of which, I had to indulge in. The Very Berry French toast was the BEST French toast I've ever tasted in my life.   The eggs Benedict came out looking super tasteful! The diced potatoes were so delicious, I wish I ordered some to-go!   The kids menu is so full of many choices, I was surprised my daughter took a VERY long time to decide. Her pancakes came out looking so appealing to her, she chowed it down so fast.   I absolutely love the fact that this is a FAMILY restaurant, only because I have 2 young children inherited my raging hangry attitude. The crayons was a perfect touch to distract them while our food came out. It was also cool how they tag-teamed to deliver our food to the table, rather than multiple trips.   Jessica recommended so many items, I'll be back to knock them off the list! She is definitely one of the cooler servers I've ever had in a dining experience, which will definitely bring me back again!  Can't wait to try more!",

We showed her the drips and she said \"oh, that's just water\". We had to show her that it was sticky and she said \"ok I'll wipe it down\". Granted, she did come back and wipe the table down, but I still ate my breakfast with someone else's crumbs in my seat. Call me old fashioned, but if a customer points out the table being dirty, it shouldn't matter if it's water or not. In the service industry, you should just clean it up with no argument and not try to excuse the table being dirty.",

The other bad note was they do not offer senior discount on the weekend my one last complaint is we waited over 1 hour and 10 min for our food. We told the manager and he had the too bad soo sad attitude. I also noticed on the menu omelette comes with gadh browns and they still charged me $2.95 extra.

We arrived with a lady in the parking lot trying to sell me and my friend jewelry to buy laundry softener, super random and declined politely. Wait time was less than 15 minutes, getting our drink order was also quick and ordering just went smoothly. I admired the three plate specials displayed by the front along with the rotation cake fridge. I ordered a chilequile which meant I cleared my plate. My group cleared their plates as well and didnt forget to tip our server. While we were heading to pay our tab the wait line was pretty long but I was digging this old lady's style with wearing two eye glasses trying to keep the queue down.",

The kids had the Kids Chocolate Chip Pancakes... which had to be a mistake as there were 3 huge pancakes with chocolate chips for $2... Folks and sister had the Chicken Parm...it had a nice presentation...but tasted flat.  It needed a lot of salt and parmesan cheese.  Brother in law had the Sausage Skillet.  The portions are generous.  The coffee is outstanding  The service is somewhat unconventional and there appears to be a lack of \"must be adhered to standards\" that you get at corporate restaurants... Service wasn't great...but it certainly did not suck.  With a little work by someone who knows the business, this easily could be a 4 or 5 star family diner.",

    "text": "So,  the first time we dined at this Blueberry Hill our experience was OK. It was a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quickly,  service was OK, the restaurant was clean, food came out in a decent amount of time.  My daughter was happy with her chocolate chip pancakes,  boyfriend was satisfied with his steak and eggs, my \"little boy blue\" was meh. Portions were large,  prices are reasonably cheap,  flavor/seasoning was meh (my blueberry pancakes, while tasty on their own,  were smothered with an ample amount of blueberry goo... firm, almost hard, blueberries in a heavily corn starched \"sauce\").  The second time....  Again,  it was a Sunday. The lobby was full so we were expecting a half hour to 45 minute wait,  so imagine or surprise when the host informed us it was only going to be 10-15 minutes.  Score! We were seated in the allotted time,  however it took about 15 additional minutes for our server to greet us and another half hour for our order to reach the table.    My daughter's medium steak came out very well done (dry with no pink). My over medium eggs came out sunny side up (I'm pregnant and \"shouldn't\" have eaten them but was starving at that point). Boyfriend's medium burger and over easy egg also came out disappointingly over done. Our friend's biscuits and gravy came out burnt? But as mentioned earlier,  we were super hungry/over it and didn't want to wait another hour for a refire... our server was nowhere to be found.    To be fair,  we'll probably give this place another shot in a few months.   Until then,  we'll stick to our go-to weekend brunch spots with consistently awesome food,  consistently long wait times and consistent service (Mr. Mama's, Babystacks, and Eggworks).",

After ordering, she proceeds to complain about the food they serve saying it's \"gross\" as well as making very unacceptable commentary on the customers at other tables. One comment she made was \"they're so f***ing needy.\" Soon after, she drops off our food to the table and immediately asks \"could you guys check out early so I can leave?\" Unbelievable. Never have I ever been rushed to eat and pay at a restaurant because the waitress didn't want to stay. I ordered nachos, which were meant to come with various toppings and it was only cheese, and the chips were burnt black. After letting her know she became irritated and scratched it off the check and says \"there, took it off. Eat it if you want I guess.\" didn't even OFFER to make a new plate. This was my only entree. She talked over me and I had to wait to flag her down to have a new one made, she was busy chatting. She handed our table off to another waitress (who was very kind) and she was out the door. I guess the managers are gone after 6pm according to young lady up front, but I have a card and will be contacting manager tomorrow. This was the most unprofessional, appalling behavior I have ever encountered from a waitress. Very disappointing considering I've been a loyal and repeated customer for years. It's been a couple hours now and my roommates, as well as myself, are still very bothered by our experience tonight.",

Still, nothing was said but \"follow her\" --  The waitress Barbara walked up to the table and said with an attitude \"Are you ready?\" We started to order; the entire time she was very unpleasant not looking at us once, and throwing her hands up in the air when I asked what salad dressings were available.  At that point I could no longer handle the negative service and as she started to repeat the order in a rude tone, I let her know we no longer wanted to eat here because she is rude.  She then stated \"I'm just repeating your order\" again, throwing her hands up.   Ended up at the location on the east side of town. Much better service.

The service is fantastic our waitress made sure to offer great substitutes for things they didn't have ready yet and persisted on giving us what was missing when it was ready. Great little diner",

My wife's eggs, potatoes and bacon tasted like they were cooked in old oil that was used to cook skunk before! The manager did take her breakfast off our bill! As we left(without leaving a tip) we saw Tammy pointing at us and talking to another waitress! Maybe Tammy didn't like the fact that I was carrying my gun, which is perfectly legal! Never had such a problem in other Blueberry Hill locations! We won't be back!",

    "text": "Nice clean and big restaurant. Extensive menu...lots of breakfast items to choose from. The hubby said the coffee was good. The others in my party had pancakes...short stacks. They were really light and fluffy. There were three pancakes about the size of a salad plate. So here's the thing...I ordered a ham and cheese omelette. They make them with four eggs. I asked if I might be able to order one half the size. The server said sure, it could be made with two eggs. Cool!  She asked if I wanted bread and potatoes. I said no carbs for me. I happened to look at the menu after she left and saw three pancakes could have been one of the sides I declined. One of the others in my party could have had that. Oh well. But the real surprises when I got the bill. My two egg omelette was $13.99...full price, just as one made with TWICE the ingredients. AND there was a full charge at menu price for those who had short stacks. They didn't take one off since it came with my breakfast. Come on, guys, just because we were in Vegas, it doesn't mean we had money to throw away. The food was good, I was just a bit put out that the server didn't suggest one of the short stacks to go with my $13.99 omelette nor did she mention that a half omelette is full price.",

Food is solid, and staff is good.  This location use to be a Marie Calendars so it is quite new in appearance and spacious compare to the other Blurberry locations.  Great place to take the family and kids.  Pros :  Good place for breakfast. Pies are yummy. Staff is friendly This location was bigger than other Blueberrys Kids menu items were huge  Cons :  Coffee could be stronger.   Steak should have more seasoning for steak and eggs breakfast.  If still give this classic Las Vegas breakfast spot 5 stars.",

It's great for brunch, reminds me of a Marie Calendars with the desert display in the front. I always get the chicken and waffles which are delicious. The Oreo cheesecake was really good too. Last time I was there I ordered a mimosa which was more juice than champagne, I was a little upset about that. Other then that I've never had any complaints, the service is always fast and they are friendly. I'm going to to try the pancakes next time which I heard were bomb!",

She always takes care of me when I stop in and highly recommend her as a server at this location.   Food is awesome for breakfast, lunch or even late night munchies after the club.

Okay, so maybe my taste buds are feeling some type of way right now because I've seen the reviews and not many people have enjoyed this place BUT I feel it's one of those gems that are a little underrated. Maybe it's just me?  I too was a little skeptical. I wanted mashed potatoes or just an All American type of meal. My BF had tried it many years ago (lol, palm to forehead!) okay babe, Let's give it a go.   Exterior looks a little dated and interior looks like the outside...dated but in a weird way, I dig it! It was clean and well kept.  So I saw our waitress take pancakes to another table and I told my BF that we needed to order pancakes because they were HUGGGE and Fluffy!!! Dripping with that yummy strawberry compote and whipped cream. Let me tell you, they were worth every bite!   Our server was sweet and welcoming. She was knowledgeable on the menu items and also letting us know about portion sizes as well. I ordered the chicken noodle to start. Very hearty! Full of chunky veggies, chicken and noodles. I also ordered the Honey Coconut Chicken which came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies (broccoli and carrots, yum, my favorite!) My Bf ordered the special which was meat loaf topped with red sauce, fettuccine and a garlic bread. He said it was very good and really liked the fettuccine, it was simple and tasted homie. And to share, we got the Fresh Strawberry Pancakes topped w/ strawberries, whipped cream and strawberry compote.  Everything we had was splendid! Definitely give them a try at this location.",

A server then came over after a slight delay and we weren't quite ready so she said she would be back in a moment.. that was probably a 20 minutes later moment.  We even flagged down someone else who worked there and asked for our server.  We finally ordered which included a beverage..   We then received our food, still no drink, and there were breakfast potatoes instead of hashbrowns.  Rather than just apologizing and getting me what I ordered she showed me she had written down breakfast potatoes.. I work in F&B.. I don't really care what you write down.  I continued to wait for my drink until after the hashbrowns I ordered came out.  It was as if my drink was the dessert at the end.    We then had to flag down our server again to pay as we had been there for nearly 1.5 hours at this point.

I come around 1 when it's a little bit slower but this place I always full. For great reasons! I believe the best bang for your buck are the skillets. It's an entire skillet with potatoes meat and cheese served in a pan. I opt for the Guadalajara skillet with chorizo and potato and I get the skillet added with mushrooms! This meal is a 10! Ofcourse you can't go wrong with the Chocolate Oreo pancakes. I always buy pies here for events! They have the best pie in Las Vegas I choose the coconut creme pie and chocolate silk pie and they're the first pies gone at gatherings! I have also tried the monte Christo sandwich with French toast! I love the taste but my only thing is the French toast becomes a little soggy ! I'm sure you will find something for everyone here!",

    "text": "Las Vegas' Blueberry Hill Restaurants have been around since the 80s and we finally got around to having a taste. Conveniently open 24/7 the restaurants are a great fit for every mood and occasion; all-day breakfast, lunch, late night specials (aka drunk food), and all-American comfort food.    Some of the other locations are old and run down, but this \"new-ish\" location is well kept and modern while keeping its warm diner-esque feel. Late night specials for $5.99 are offered from 11pm-7am, daily specials are affordable at $7.99 a plate.   We were two of four customers early this morning, waitress Nix took care of all of us. Great customer service! Very attentive and friendly. She seemed to get along really well with the other patrons. That small-town restaurant banter is hard to find in this city.   We look forward to dining here again.",

Immediately knew that if the found was even half-decent, we would become regulars here.  Sure enough the service was on-point. Wait staff was on their game. The food (Pro-tip: honey coconut chicken waffle) was a winner. Great food, easy in & out. Well priced. The dinner menu looks great too, and I wouldn't mind trying it out sometime if in the area. Didn't get to try out the desserts this time but that looks worthwile too.  Thank you! We will be back and we will be bringing (lots) of family and friends with us!",

    "text": "Norma royalty screwed up!!!!  I love BlueBerry Hill. I've brought my mom, family and Fiance here a couple times. And we have family visiting next month and plan to bring them here. ...BUT...NOW we might not come.   June 14, 2017 approximately 8:30pm. We came for a late dinner. I called ahead of time to see if there was a wait. I was told no. When we got there we had the wait like 5 minutes for them to clear off tables. ...restaurant wasn't even a 1/4 full. And many tables were already set up. Then the Hostess seats us all by ours ourselves in another section of the restaurant.  Tell us our waitress will be right with us....nope....after like 10-12 minutes we had to send my son to ask for our waitress. ..then she came over.. didn't greet or even apologize for I ur wait.. just asked if we know what we want.  We order a Monte Cristo Sandwich and I Double Chesse burger. She asked if I wanted the one with Chili. I said Definitely not. Just the cheese burger. She said okay left.     After a few she brought over our food. My son order was right expect for no extra sauce on the side as requested.  And she handed me a Chili Chesse Burger.  I said oh no, I didn't order that.  I said I can't have Chili, I have intense heartburn. That would be a bad thing for me to have. She said oh, I thought you order it. She didn't apologize nor say she would handle it, instead she said can we just scrape off the Chili? She said I have a group of 18 over there.   What?!?!?!!!!  I was offended that she ask to scrape off the chili off my burger and give me the same sandwich back. She didn't offer to make me a new one. I told her it's already late and if she not able to just get me a new one soon. Go ahead, I couldn't have the Chili.  She ended up taking it back to the kitchen then brought it back to me.   As habit I took the top patty off to ear and noticed there was still chili on the burger. They just swapped the bottom for the top patty. I wasn't happy at all but it was coming on the 9:30 now she came back and ask if we were okay. We pointed out the problem and I said I don't feel like I should have to pay for a this kind this. She said no, I'm going to waive the charge for it. She said she just wants to make it right. I said it will be fine. I WAS through the roof, upset at this point.   I started eating one of the patties, then a few minutes later she brings me a new burger. I said okay, I didn't ask her to do that. I Ended up eat like half and boxed the rest up due to me losing my appetite.    After she brought me the second hamburger,  we were completely ignored by all staff members.  Until the Hostess came over to bring me the ticket.  So obviously wasn't ask if everything was okay, do we want dessert,  is there anything else like drink refills ..   When we went up to pay the tickets was showing full price. I told to the hostess that our server said she would to comp the burger due to a mix up. She asked the waitress she said no, she ended up getting the right one. I said excuse me, you said you would take care of her. She mumbled something and the Hostess changed my total.   I was completely disturbed how the situation was taken care of and the to do it.  I am going to reach out to management in the morning.   Thanks for reading,   Victoria Martinez  Executive Housekeeper",

The turkey was dry, the stuffing was bland, the the mashed potatoes were cold and the corn was very salty. I really wanted it to be all that I wanted and more but that wasn't the case. My fiance got the country fried steak which was okay but nothing spectacular. Guess we should've stuck with ordering breakfast food. Apparently their French toast is delicious.

    "text": "Huge portions!  The prices are a bit high, IMO, but considering the quality of the food and the amount of food, the prices are not too unreasonable.  I went with my mom and my two year old.  The 3 of us shared a Spinach and Mushroom Omelette and we didn't even finish all of our breakfast.  Omelettes are made with 4 eggs and come with your choice of side (3 homemade buttermilk pancakes, 2 wedges of french toast, or hashbrowns and toast).  We opted for the 3 buttermilk pancakes.  They were delicious,  thick, fluffy, and great flavor.  I was impressed that they were served with real butter and it was whipped.  Nice!  Also, the syrup comes to the table warm in a syrup dispenser (no cold syrup from a single serve pack).    The omelette was good, nothing too special, but good.  We told our waitress we were sharing and she was very accommodating and brought us extra plates.  We asked for more butter and she brought us a large portions of that glorious whipped real butter.  Went again with the husband and baby and I ordered the Ham and Cheese Omelette with pancakes.  Omelette was cheesy and tasty.  Pancakes were still delicious.  Again, asked for more butter and got a huge dollop of real butter (the pancakes probably come with plenty of butter but I like A LOT of butter, especially when it is real and whipped).    My husband ordered the Blueberry's Meat Lover's Skillet.  He loved it (and he is not afraid to let me know when he thinks something is not so bueno).  He said it had tons of meat, but not too much, and the pieces of meat were large and great quality.  He had plenty to bring home and had it the next day from breakfast and still did not finish it!  Both times our servers were extremely friendly, courteous, and attentive.  The ambience is nice and they had sports on the tv's through out the restaurant.  It reminds me a bit of a Mimi's Cafe or Marie Calendar's, as far as style, but a small step up and much better food.    Menu is huge with tons of variety.  There is something for everyone, anytime of day.  Oh, and the cakes in the front look amazing.",

Inexcusable guest service, she made no attempt to interact with us.  I will not be coming back again.",

    "text": "Hello.  Thank you for letting me write an review for this restraunt. Here is how I judge my reviews off of each restaruant I visit. Example Layout:  Cleanness Of the Restruant  Quality Of the food  Pricing  Service  Speed  Now, at my visit, I ordered the double trouble cheeseburger. Rating:  Reason: The things I like about this restaruant are how comfortable the seating is as it is relaxing and has some leather back cushions. Both the Cleanness of the restaruant and service I like because once you have been seated, they offer you drinks and the menu has the pricing. Now the pricing is not a star because the sandwiches are at least 9.00 to 12.00 which doesn't include tax and as for this is why I  give it a .5 star. Now for the speed, it all depends on how much people are currently in the restaruant. I am currently in the restaruant and have gotten my meal within 15 mins of waiting. So for that I rate a full star for the speed. The Quality of the food is amazing, not burnt and ready to eat. So overall this restaurant 4.5 review, but since the site woulsnt let me do a half star, ill jsut bump this to a 5 star review!Thanks for having me!",

    "text": "There are so many things I like about this restaurant that I wanted to let them know the few problems I have so they get them fixed and I'll have a perfect restaurant to go to!  Blueberry Hill on Flamingo is in an old Marie Calendar's so the booths are big and comfortable.  Their menu is huge and has a dish to suit any craving.  They have a full bar which is a lot of fun too.  So, now the bad stuff. First and foremost, I DON'T WANT TO EAT TEFLON. Their skillets are served in the scratched up teflon egg pans that are no longer useful for quick-flipping eggs.  When teflon is scratched it chips and gradually comes off the pan.  Teflon is toxic.  It would quit easily get into your food.  The fact that they are using these for table service is UNBELIEVABLE.  Either strip all of the teflon off or throw them in the trash.  Those pans are not meant for table service.  They look cheap and the chipped teflon freaks me out.  The other problem I have is the over abundance of offensive noise.  The music is often too loud and the playlists are alternately depressing or irritating.  The volume on the television sets are often turned up as well so you are forced to listen to a mix of commercials on the TV and bad music from the PA.  I like that the staff is high-energy and has a lot of hustle but sometimes they make quite a racket slamming down silverware and shouting across the room.  The patrons are forced to raise their voices above all of this to hear each other with the overall effect being a constant assault on the senses. I hope this has been constructive because I really do want to keep going there.",

Like it's really too big its way past the point of diversity and just takes way too much time to go through just to see all your options (I like small and simple). Anyway we ordered the pancakes all around (buttermilk, fresh apple, and smiley face) while we waited I took the kids to the bathroom to wash their hands and the men's bathroom smelled terrible and was pretty unclean I cringed thinking my toes might touch the floor in my flip flops. Came back and food was there quickly but the portions were MASSIVE which is usually nice but I wouldve rather paid less and gotten half since pancakes don't really reheat the best. Gf sent back her pancakes because they were too tough and the server was very nice and insistent that we did so and took it off our bill hastily which was really nice. My fresh apple pancakes were pretty good but I'm a big guy and I could only finish half of them.  Overall this place seems to be really popular but it's just not my piece of cake. Really think they should have smaller portions and not just serve and charge for your breakfast and reheated lunch. Probably won't come back since I feel iHop is better.  3 stars because of the bathrooms and the all the food besides mine wasn't really that good.",

The bacon had good flavor but was hard and over cooked,  it tasted like it was saturated in grease. I Also ordered I side of chunky potatoes which were hard and undercooked with no flavor at all.

Served with three buttermilk pancakes or hashbrowns with toast and jelly. - $13.49).  It was divine and a side of fluffy pancake. Worth the price and calories. This is a gem of a place!",

    "text": "Okay well this was my first time coming here but my friend recommended it. I guess the place looked really big and the cakes and bakery in the front all looked really pretty and even the menu was really big and had so many items to choose from. The lady that was serving us was really nice and the place played really hip music but only issue.. I don't think place is really clean at all! Like our table was a little dirty the lady forgot all our silverware (we had to go take silverware from another table) I ordered the chicken Parmesan because the waitress said that that was her favorite .. And when I got my food omg it looked absolutely NOTHING like the picture in the menu ): it looked like a giant SLOP on my plate like something you'd be served as a school lunch but probably worse.. the picture showed that there would be broccoli but the plate had a whole pile of corn BLECH! so I told the lady I expected something like the broccoli from the picture and she said she'd give me a side dish of veggies so I got broccoli, cauliflower and carrots (that was a bit better)  then halfway dining I see this GIANT COCKROACH ON THE GROUND WALKING TOWARDS ME OMG. I absolutely HATE roaches and seeing one in the place I am dining in made me lose my appetite real fast and that thing ran right under me too *cries* this place just disgusts me , I'm only giving this place a 1 star because first I can't give 0 stars and second the lady was actually kinda nice so 1 star goes to the waitress but I recommend not coming here the place is dirty and food isn't made to perfection not very quality food if you ask me",

It could've had more flavor. Small portion of alright hash browns. My roommate hated his burrito. He didn't enjoy it at all. My boyfriend loves his apple pancakes but when I had a bite, it was super starchy. For our food, it took forever. I understand that there were 4 of us but no on was ahead and it shouldn't have taken that long. The food isn't bad, but it's not good. I don't recommend this place.",

Still reminds me a lot of the MC that was there before they took over, but still clean. Very Clean. We were seated in a booth that was comfy and was told our waiter would arrive shortly. Shortly must have ment 15 minutes because the busser with the coffee came by several times before we our water showed up.  Now our waiter, Josh, was a young kid. But boy did his face read disdain when he arrived at our table. We ordered right away. My mother ordered a piece of blueberry pie, I ordered the Bonanza, and my 5 year old ordered the kids mac'n'cheese with fries.   Then we played the waiting game. Which actually didn't take long at all. My mom received her pie right away. Somewhat to our disappointment because we figured all our found would arrive together. Then came the other meals. I really wish we had taken pictures of the food. My \"scrambled eggs\" were a little on the runny side. and two pieces of bacon were somewhat burnt. (my daughter actually ate those) Her mac'n'cheese though had burnt noodles, or cheese or whatever it was. She took one bite and almost threw up on the table. Now she's a picky kid so I tried it.... She wasn't lying. It was thick and not creamy and tasted of the burnt whatever. So what does she do? Go to town on the fries.I really don't blame her for not eating it.  So here comes Josh, oh Josh, he asks how everything is and my daughter immediately replies \"It's gross!\" to which I then in turn tell him it was, when he reached for the plate I asked him to leave it because she was eating the fries.  Fast Forward Check time. JOSH DIDN'T REMOVE THE MAC'N'CHEESE FROM OUR BILL! My kid didn't even touch it and you are going to charge me for it?!?! You even went to go take the plate! Honestly, I was so angry, we paid and left. We will not be returning, and I will not suggest. The only reason I'm giving it stars, is because the other two meals were delicious.",

This location is on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur not to mistake for the other location on Decatur across from Wal-Mart. The menu is just silly, way to big and full of food I know they dont sell everyday. Why sell food items you hardly get orders for. They should refine the menu and throw out 75% and just fix the items that are okay. Everything is so bland, they do not flavor the vegetables at all and other things really lack flavor. Only things okay are breakfast items, waffles are good, biscuit and gravy okay. I never really get everything I want though because they are not very flexible, if you wanna make adjustments it might cost $3 when they shouldn't. Service is funny, most servers are just okay and no one works together. They should help each other, refill drinks, ask if everything's okay because your server might not come around. I have literally never got an egg order right though, they always under cook eggs even if told how the yoke is preferred so don't be picky. They hand write receipts and use a hand calculator so confusing what you paid. The menu is confusing, a lady expected hash browns at the other table but was basically told sorry learn to read, no attempt to make them happy. My over medium well eggs came out over read easy again, they didn't even try. Had to ask for refills twice. It's crazy how much this place could improve. The owners hopefully will take note and make adjustments but things have not changed at all since opening. I'll be back for late night wake waffles and will update with any changes. Enjoy",

Never pushy. If every restaurant had a server like her; business would be booming! Every restaurant needs a Veronica!! Thanks again! We will be back",

Their chocolate chip pancakes are solid, but so are all their other flapjack creations. I've tried the Oreo ones, cheesecake, nibbled on the banana strawberry ones off my friend's dish; I'm telling you, if you want pancakes in Vegas, don't even glance in the direction of IHOP, this is the place to go.  Pancakes aside, the rest of the sweets are fantastic. I've tried the chocolate malt shake--so indulgent! The rest of the cakes look divine, so I'll definitely dig into a slice of chocolate of carrot cake on my next visit to Sin City.  Servers are on-too of their game, efficient, funny, and quick. Keep an eye out for Sally, she's the best.  Lastly, the prices. For under $12, you'll eat like royalty, I guarantee.",

The Blueberries are not fresh- they are frozen and tasteless, even the cup of blueberries they gave me on the side (which were thawed, cold and nasty) - the chefs should pop one in their mouth and see what they're serving people. People must be fooled by the blueberry compote they pile on of these pancakes. I opt out of the canned blueberry filling on top of blueberry pancakes so the \"real\" flavors can come through. This was very disappointing. Blueberry pancakes should never be made with old, unthawed blueberries.  The eggs and bacon were great though and so was the omelette my husband had, so I'm sure other breakfast items might be delish- will try something different if I come back again which I probably won't because there are sooo many other places to eat in Las Vegas. But I will recommend it to others as someplace to try for yourself.   Prices are great for the amount of food you get and the customer service was lovely.",

    "text": "Nothing comforts like comfort FOOD: I was so surprised by this restaurant.  We used to have a place that seemed similar called Millie's later cleverly renamed \"Mills\" in my neighborhood and they couldn't even fry an egg...But here, 24 hr breakfast favorites in an array of choices like blueberry or cinnamon and the list goes on.  One of my go-tos is country fried steak and this one was so juicy and tender, no gristle like some other CFS dishes.  You can change up the sides to curly fries as yours truly did.  I wished they would have done green beans with bacon and onion like other country restaurants do, this one was red peppers which dominated the green bean taste.  I want to go back for one of the variations of chicken and waffles like coconut chicken or original.  I'm a sucker for chicken and even more so for a waffle.  Honey chicken strips were alright and both come with either cornbread, biscuit, or both, why not both I say.    You can upgrade to soup/salad and a dessert choice. They have quite a few choices of dessert: strawberry shortcake, chocolate oreo, various pies: blueberry, apple etc.  Cheesecakes like strawberry or oreo.  I have to say, I can't remember a BETTER blueberry pie.  I went home after this and started researching pie crusts and blueberry pie filling - NO LIE!  And as for the soup, it was freshly made and on the brothier side like when you have a flu...I prefer thicker and creamier chicken noodles but this was still good and I got my daily dose of veggies.    Service/Ambiance: actually super spatious, tall pillars and lots of windows and various seating areas.  Feels like an 'Fancy' Denny's with more space.  Our server was super professional and super friendly, she told us her name was Xena/Zena like the warrior princess.  Sorry about the spelling but I'd definitely ask for her again.  She offered drinks to go and made sure every aspect of our dining experience was \"On Point\" as they say.  So much so that we would definitely go back !!",

She eventually warmed up but it wasn't very inviting. Our waitress kept forgetting items and when reminded, her response was either a curt \"I know,\" or \"yeah I got it.\" If that were the case it would have been nice if she said something to the effect of \"I'll be right back with your orange juice,\" as opposed to dropping off most of our items and walking away. Never saw that orange juice halfway into my meal. Instead, she went on to take another order from a table next to us. She passed me three more times then I canceled it. It's ok to be busy and forget. It happens. However, when I politely remind you, I can do without the attitude. It's a weird environment. A lot of the waitresses were frowning. I personally like friendly service so I wouldn't return or recommend it. Oh- good food also helps. My omelette was just ok but none of the kids enjoyed their waffles and refused to eat them.

We went out for a little walk around the new strip. After working up an appetite my sisters friend suggested for us to go here.  Now I'm the type of guy who couldn't pass up on a locals recommendation. I did the chorizo skillet which was definitely pretty good. It's too bad I had that nasty flu that was going around. You know the one that screwed with your taste buds, made you have no appetite what so ever.  Anyways, the service here was definitely pretty good. I think our server was one of two women who was doing the whole floor and she definitely kept up. Our waters and coffee were refilled and never did we ever have a long wait. Would definitely eat here again.  Thank you for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!",

Once we were seated, our waitress (Bonney) greeted us with her warm smile and gave us excellent service!   If you're tired of the Vegas buffets and craving for comfort food, come down to Blueberry Hill!   P.s. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because when we first walked in the restaurant, no one greeted us and the ladies by pie shelf just looked at us without acknowledging and walked away. Eventually, someone did arrive and seated us to our table.",

Anyhow my first impression is this location is alot bigger then the other location and I love the design they also have alot more to add on the menu compared to the other location as for the food it was just as good as the other location same big portions for the same exact price the only negative was the potatoes some were cooked the others were real raw to the point where I couldn't eat anymore but that's my only grip with the food as it was delicious I'm still full and this was about 10:30 am and now it's 1:24 pm lol. As for the service it was so so the lady didn't check on me as much as she did and she didn't offer me a knife fork or spoon she was nice but I just wish she checked on me more then she did other then that with those major gripes I think I might come back here again.",

We came on a Sunday at noon and probably the worst time you can go to a family restaurant. We waited about 20 min. We got our table and served drinks within 3 mins. The menu is hugh! Don't really know if I would eat anything but breakfast here but we ordered the country breakfast and the pancakes were great. They were hot, large, and great taste. We just got regular ones too. I can only imagine how the speciality ones taste. The eggs, bacon, and rest of the food was great. The service was good for being a packed house with others waiting outside. We came at their busiest time and I can say that it's been the best so far in this town of excesses. Without going on the strip and paying through the nose on atmostphere instead of quality, this is the best. Great Job Blueberry Hill. We will be back often.",

We're sorry we didn't find this place on our first day, we would have been here every morning for breakfast. The portions are huge! My husband is a big guy with a big appetite, and he could not finish his meal. We both had the ham and cheese omelette with a side of pancakes. The ham tasted like fresh baked ham, not restaurant supply ham. We took the extra pancakes back to our room and noshed on them the following day, they were still just as tasty as the first day and even tasted good cold! Our waitress was on the ball, I wish I got her name because I would give her a special shout out for being so great.  When she packed up our leftovers, She even offered to put my husbands beverage in a to-go cup~! I'm going to look and see if this restaurant chain is in New Jersey~ I cant wait until our next trip to Vegas to eat here again.",

They didn't change much as far as interior decor goes, but I am glad after quote a while of this location being vacant that there is a new restaurant in the area. Even better to have a new breakfast spot.   On this occasion, my mom and I stuck to the dinner menu and they have several grand opening specials going on now. We opted for dinner entrees and received a free dessert. The menu is huge and after a long time of perusing I decided on the honey coconut chicken with a side of fries and green beans. I do not like canned veggies, so I avoided the green beans, but enjoyed the rest of my meal. The chicken was moist and not overly sweet like I was expecting. My mom enjoyed her pork chops and for dessert I ordered the carrot cake and my mom went with the blueberry pie. She enjoyed her, but I felt mine was a little dry for my taste. I took it home and my fella enjoyed it quite a bit, so it's more of a acquired taste.  I'm usually a fan of this chain's breakfasts, so I'll be back for that. They also have an enormous assortment of desserts to choose from that are all made in house.   The food is nothing amazing, but it's solid and this location is a lot nicer than others in town.",

I've been to this location 3 times, and I always order either the Classic Eggs Benedict or the Alaskan Waffle. Both are absolutely delicious and this new location carry out same great flavors.   The reason I gave this location 2-star is due to their customer service. All three times I've been here, I've had to wait at least couple minutes for someone to greet me when I walk in the door. During my most recent visit, I was with a party of 5 and we got seated at a booth with no menus, no servers in sight, and no busser to serve us water. We waited about 15 minutes to get our iced waters. And then waited approximately another 5-10 minutes for a server to come and take our order. I understand that it was a busy day (Saturday morning), perhaps the hostess shouldn't have sat us until the server was ready to serve another table?   I probably won't be coming back to this location, I am willing to drive to the location on Charleston and Decatur for a better dining experience.",

Syrup isn't needed that's how delicious these were  First my experience here was pretty good we were seated by a host in less than 5 mins (lunchtime) very friendly staff  Server arrived fairly quick and was friendly greeted with smiles...served us beverages we ordered apple juice (which was cold some places neglect serving cold apple juice for whatever reason) but the water tasted like tap some people like myself are fairly anal about that but I couldn't bare drinking it   Next server took our order which was a basic four , four , four breakfast with eggs , bacons and pancakes and also I ordered the speciality cinnamon pancakes   After that the speed in which we received our food was legendary, however as most know that's not always a good thing could mean cold food or just bad quality HOWEVER that was not the case the pancakes were extremely delicious, bacon was average as well as eggs but i stand firm these our the best pancakes in town by far...  One thing I did not like at all was we were served our checked with our food basically.. it made me feel like I was rushed this was a family trip so we weren't at the bar we were at the table.. I suggest future reference that they present the check when they are 100% for certain the customer is satisfied. It can give off a bad vibe if you present the check with the dinner.  Pros -------- Pancakes , servers attitudes, preparation time,   Cons  ----------- Water , delivered check with the food,",

The syrup vessel was covered in sticky syrup (hadn't been cleaned off in a while).The cakes and pies on display were beautiful.  If you are on a budget, this is the place to go (more for your money). Great place for large groups as well.",

Attempted again today cold eggs, cold burger, cold everything.   Over-worked waitresses leaves food to sit forever before bringing it to table this has happened on 5 different visits. I give up, I have tried to like this place but cant tolerate luke-warm and cold food. especially eggs.Way Way over-priced all you folks that gave this joint 5 stars are idiots with deep pockets and no tastebuds.    Once again though all the employees here are great, the food lacks taste and heat.    I give up....",

I enjoy thier other Decatur location by 95 and the first time I came to this one the service and food wasn't up to par.   I ordered thier Giant Baked Ham Sandwich and it was huge! The menu says a quarter pound but I honestly think there's more in this one. Comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo and your choice of bread. You can also have curly fries or regular fries with it.   This sandwich was definitly satisfying, more than enough and very reasonable at $9.99, thier menu is huge! So much to choose from, definitly no shortage of options. I'm not much for breakfast so I'll eat lunch food in the morning if I'm out, and there is a ton of options if you don't want to just be limited to lunch food.   The service was on point, never had to ask for a refill, very friendly and kept checking up on us. This experience was a lot better than last time, I always give places another chance. Sometimes it could just be a shitty day, this one not the case on this visit.",

Aside from having an extensive menu, we feel very much at home and this particular location treats us incredibly well.  Ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a \"hometown\" type diner. The staff is friendly and casual, the furniture and fixtures aren't the newest, nor are they the nicest, but they give off a warm atmosphere and it is very easy to feel comfortable here.  The service is always friendly and attentive. I couldn't ask for more from a five star restaurant, let alone a little family style diner. We always get smiles from our servers and our food is prepared quickly and correctly. Interacting with the staff here is always great.  The food is the highlight, undoubtedly. Blueberry Hill has an incredible menu and we've gotten a different item every single time we've been. It would take a long time to work your way through the entire offering. My personal recommendation is the four cheese French toast. Out of this world.  Blueberry Hill is a great place to get filled up for cheap and enjoy delicious food and gracious service. This is a \"comfort food\" place first and foremost. Nothing fancy, no glitz or glamour, just warmth and heartiness.",

BH Ambiance & Service:  Tons of seating to anticipate lots of diners and it's very busy during my breakfast and lunch visits. There's also a counter and full sized bar.  Servers have consistently been good and it seems like everyone here knows how to handle big tables.  The kitchen gets your dishes out fast even when the restaurant is at full capacity  BH Cuisine:  I'm a fan of their breakfast plates and I order them during non-breakfast times.  Recently I had the Mexican skillet and it was tasty dish paired well with two fried eggs on top.  You can't go wrong with any of the omelettes and the pancakes are always generous in serving and fluffy.   Their monte cristo is delicious and loaded with meats and cheese. When I'm not eating a breakfast plate, their cheeseburger is what I'm ordering as it's done well for me here.    I don't order anything too complex at high volume restos.  Overall, I stick to the simple dishes and Blueberry Hill has delivered every visit.  They're open 24/7 and if I'm on this side of town I'll visit here before any Strip coffee shop.  Enjoy! =)",

She wrote down over easy and then tried convincing me what I ordered.... So I munched in buttered toast while I waited. This place is super loud. Not just table laughter/ chatter but the dishes are slammed often.  The syrup dispenser was gross- it had yellow egg yolk on it. I read the reviews expecting large portions and it was average sized portions to me. I ate just my eggs and corned beef in my skillet and left the potatoes. Waitress didn't ask how the food was or anything. She did take our plates. Worst first and LAST impression I'll have of this place. Cashier felt bad about our experience but I rather pay the bill than get a manager I'm sure he/she hears enough complaints. I got all dressed up wanting to make it a special holiday morning.  Maybe we caught them on an off day but I thought the food was okay - truck stop food. Coffee was jet fuel and no flavored creamers to lighten the heavy taste. Left here in a bad mood when breakfast is supposed to make you happy.  We paid our bill and decided never again. Such a shame too - gorgeous restaurant and bar!! Crap service.  Guess I'll stick to what I know as good breakfast I feel so sick from the amount of soybean oil in the food it warns you on the menu. That should of been a red flag for me.",

I just got the cheese burger and fries, and another Alaskan waffle. Friends got the monte Cristo sandwich and an omelet .  The burger was just ok, I guess I can't expect too much if I am coming to a breakfast place looking for fantastic burgers. We also asked the waitress to put out the Alaska waffle last, because we wanted to have it as a dessert since it has ice cream on top of the waffle. When she put out the waffle the ice cream was completely melted like it has been sitting out for a while rather than recently prepared like we have asked. The Alaskan waffle dish itself was great though, waffle made perfectly, it would of just been much better with not ALL melted ice cream   I sampled my friend's monte cristo sandwich, it was delicious savory meat on a sweet French toast bread, definitely something different you could try.",

We were seated fairly quickly.   Once seated, I was overwhelmed by the amount of options on the menu.  I couldn't decide on breakfast or a sandwich so I settled on a Monte Cristo. It was very good.   The reason why I am giving the restaurant 3 starts is because the service was not that great. We asked for additional silverware and the waitress just stumped it all on the table in front of me and when I asked for some extra napkins, I was given 1. Literally, one. Someone at my table ordered pancakes and it took us about 15 minutes to finally get syrup and no one ever came to check on us about the quality of the food. Thus, it took a decent amount of time to get a to-go-box and our check.  I would definitely still check this place out. Maybe I just went on an off day.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me based on good food and good prices.  It did not disappoint!  I walked in and was greeted by a very friendly hostess.  Since I was alone, I asked if the bar was open seating.  With a smile, she said yes, so I found an open seat at the bar.  The server handling the bar area seemed very busy.  She was working hard, but perhaps it was a little much for her, or maybe she wasn't having a good day.  She still greeted me with a smile and gave me a glass of water.  A gentleman who arrived after I did was served first.  That didn't sit too well with me, but I understand that in a busy atmosphere, mistakes can be made.  She then proceed to ask me if \"I was ok with just water.\"  Strike 2.  I normally enjoy iced tea with my meals, so I ordered one.  She was constantly moving and didn't seem to rest, so I knew she was working hard and doing her best.  I ordered the Tennessee Fried Steak and eggs which, according to the menu, seemed to be a specialty.  The server was very friendly while taking my order, so my forgiveness for the service began to start.  My food arrived promptly, and I was very pleased to find the hash browns were still hot, and my steak was still steaming.  Fresh, hot food is always a plus.  The steak was delicious, tender, and cooked perfectly.  The hash browns were delicious too.  The sourdough toast were thick slices, and although they were a little burnt, they still tasted like sourdough toast should.  As the crowd let up a bit, my service improved.  She not only asked if she could refill my iced tea, but she also asked if she could prepare one for me to go.  She was very friendly at this point, and she wore her hard working smile well.    Overall, I was pleased that I ate here.  The recommendation given to me was accurate.  Delicious comfort food at reasonable prices!  If I decide to return, I plan on trying the pancakes or chicken and waffles plates.  Both looked like they would be delicious.",

    "text": "Having long been a fan of Cracker Barrel and looking for something similar and slightly more convenient, we happened across Blueberry Hill.  Being a fan of anything blueberry I liked the name immediately.  Inside there is a large dining room and friendly staff.  They have a very extensive menu of dishes ranging from breakfast to meat loaf and American classics to southwestern cuisine and beyond.  I decided to go for the honey coconut chicken.  I opted for the upgrade ($4 I think... ) which gets you a soft drink, soup/salad, and dessert as well.  The chicken looked a little different than the picture, but it was crispy, juicy, and had a perfect coconut taste without being overpowering.  I opted for the green beans and mashed potato for sides.  The green beans were decent though a bit overpowered by all the red bell peppers that were present as well.  The potatoes were smooth and definitely had a homemade taste rather than a boxed, dehydrated potato flavor.  The salad was fresh, crisp, cold, and had a good variety of dressing choices.  Save room for dessert... They have so many!  Of course being at Blueberry Hill and loving all things blueberry I went for the blueberry pie.  Truly out of this world!  Outstanding juicy blueberry filling with an excellent crust with sort of a streusel topping.  Truly one of the best pies I have ever had.    Blueberry Hill definitely exceeded expectations and will definitely not break the bank while providing a delicious selection of mainly \"comfort food\" and outstanding desserts!",

I ordered the Texas chili omelette which is described on the menu as onions and American cheese with homemade Texas chili on top.  It's an open face omelette with lots of beans but a bit less chili than previous times I've had this.  The recipe has changed.  You have your choice of a side and I got hash browns.  I ordered rye toast.  There was a bus person who came around often and refilled coffee mugs as needed/desired.  It was good to see him coming toward my table.

When she did arrive to take our order, she wasn't friendly and her demeanor seemed like we were taking too long to state our order. She seemed to rush us asking \"are you ready?\" to each of us.   We had to ask for two more set of utensils when our food arrived. My hash browns looked like the cook just tossed the leftovers from the griddle onto the plate. There were pieces of hash browns all over the plate. Our waitress never returned back to the table to check on us if everything was ok. The staff was not attentive.

Restaurant was very large inside. I was fooled frim the outside. The decor is nice. It looks like they may have recently remodeled. TVs hanging everywhere as well.   This spot was like denny's on steroids. The popular dishes are the waffles with chicken tenders in top. I went with the chicken apple compote waffle. For $11, it was definitely a lot of food. The apple compote is house made. Not too sweet. Chicken was okay with it. I felt it could have used a bit more seasoning. The waffle was good. It did get a little soggy but it was expected with the compote. I ordered one biscuit and gravy a la carte, $4. I thought it was good. They take a large biscuit and slightly toast it and slather it with their gravy.   Kids were happy with their pancakes. No complaints there. Plenty of food and drinks to go around at the table. Coffee was regularly served.   They did take a long time to bring us the check. I had to get up and ask for it. We paid  $63 for 3 adults and 2 kids. Not a bad deal. I would eat here again. Stop by the dessert counter and check out all those confectionary works of art.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE service. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant. We waited an hour for our pancakes and waffles which never did come out. We finally got up and left. No apologies from ANYONE!  The waitress that waited on us (or shall I say never waited on us) forgot drinks, silverware and of course our food. When I went in search of her (after 45 minutes) I found her flirting with the cooks. She saw me and flat ignored me. When we were leaving, she saw us, got another server to act as management and then hid in the back. This was not the first time something like this has happened at this restaurant. Steer clear of this one. If you want Blueberry Hill, go to the one on Decatur. This one has not only bad service, but their food is not even mediocre compared to the one on Decatur.",

    "text": "I really want to give 4 stars for the big portions and yummy food but I came in drunk at 3 am and really wanted to enjoy my meal in peace without talking to anyone since I came in alone. Luckily, I was feeling like a happy drunk that night, but my server was testing my patience. As I waited for my food he talked to me and made it clear that he thinks I'm attractive but said nothing rude or offensive but clearly I'm like half his age. Then the food comes out and I'm ready to grub. He leaves for a second, comes back then says \"I'm your server so you don't have to be embarrassed of stuffing your face in front of me.\" Then he goes off about Adam and Eve and his theory behind it. First off, I came to the place to eat, not to be social especially when I'm exhausted. Second, religion is the last thing I want to talk about. Third, I like taking my time to enjoy my meal rather than stuffing my face so I can get you to leave me alone and stop talking. I have never once had a server talk to me during my whole meal. I think I just felt too hungry to give a shit about telling him off. I literally kept nodding my head the whole time as I'm stuffing huge bites in my mouth. Oh and after he tells me his theory, I have one bite left and he says \"You can tell me if I'm talking too much.\" And starts laughing like it's funny. I'm not sure if that's just the way he serves people by making conversation or if he was just trying that hard to get my attention. I was just bored and uninterested I'm sorry to say. I swear I'm not a mean person but damn, that was annoying.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Blueberry Hills for a while now and decided to check out this new location last month. Ive been back 7 times since! The food is always delicious and the pancakes and crepes have never failed me. They have a bakery in the store too and bake their desserts fresh every day. We normally come in the mornings, service can be a little slow at times but never horrible. The staff is fun and quirky, I always hear a waitress laughing with their tables. Nix is one of my favorites, she is always upbeat and cheerful and makes me leave in a good mood after a big breakfast.       We decided to stop by for dinner this week for the first time to check it out. It was extremely busy and I was a little dissapointed we couldn't sit in our normal spot. Our server was Josh, he was very attentive and informative on their massive 16 page menu. He knew the prices on everything we asked off the top of his head , and let us know how we could save on some money by deluxing our pancakes and meals(we added it up and we saved $13.78!!). Our side salads came out quickly and we were offered dinner rolls AND corn bread (I had no idea they had these?!). The food took almost 40mins to arrive after placing our order but it came out pipin hot and everything was delicious. Our server checked in on us twice after we started eating but I noticed the poor boy(looked 18) was practically jogging taking orders, serving food, making salads, seating people, working the register, and carrying plates of food all over the store. I got the feeling the store was under staffed... I only saw 4 employees with the store fully packed.       Overall I would have to say I love the place. Its by no means the best place out there but it's definitely worth checking out. Great food, good prices, and a hard working staff is all I can ask for",

    "text": "The disaster started before we even walked in the door. We couldn't figure out where the entrance was due to no signage. We tried three different doors until we figured it out. We were seated within ten minutes even with it being moderately busy. After we were seated someone asked if we would like coffee and we put our cups out and only one was poured and the lady simply walked away with no explanation and did not let us order our daughters drink. Once the waiter, Cesar, came over he explained it was brewing which was completely fine with us. We ordered around 12:20 and then didn't get our food until almost one. The ticket time was way over what it should have been, and then we got our food and didn't even get all that we had ordered. We were missing a plate of pancakes but no one ever came by to check on us so I had to get up from the table and go find another server to bring the rest of the food as well as syrup we had requested before we ate. When our waiter found out we were missing food he brought out the pancakes and said \"they were not ready that's why I didn't bring them out\". It was extremely rude and he never once apologized or checked on us. Luckily the manager was willing to discount some of our food. If Cesar would have just apologized and checked on us, this would have never happened. I'm a server myself so I'm very patient but this was completely unacceptable and rude. We would have even ordered dessert if we would have been treated well!!! Unfortunately I will not be returning because of the awful service. The only reason that I give two stars is because the food was decent and the manager did discount our bill for the service and timing.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed in the service here and especially with the customer service. We went on Saturday January 15 and we had a party of 5. From the time we walked in, we felt an unwelcoming feeling.  Plenty of the waiters and persons working in that late morning/ afternoon shift were very unpleasant. Our waiter was Tammy and she was by far the worst waiter I ever came across in my life. She wasn't welcoming. Her attitude came off as she didn't even want to be there at work. We were very polite and she still was cold and mean. She was very aggressive with her responses. We ordered a omelette and it came half cooked. When I mentioned it to Tammy she rudely said \" What do you want me to do with it?\"  and rolled her eyes.I was startled with that response. I felt very insulted and I had to tell her three times to take it back. I told her to please take it back and bring me a menu. Grabbed the plate and ran off with it. She never brought back the menu. Since she never brought the menu I requested to just make eggs and some bacon. She comes back with it and slams it on the table and walks off. She never came back and asked if the food was okay and if there was something else we needed. We were low on water, juices and she never came back. Then she comes with the checks and slams it on the table in between the  menus and said \"Here you go, Bye.\" There were five separate checks and we couldn't even read who's bill was what. She didn't even have the courtesy to hand out our separate checks. We had to ask another waiter what was the process of paying because she never came back. We then saw her and told her if we can have boxes. My friend was trying to ask  her something as well and she just walked away. We had to ask another waiter to bring what we needed.  Tammy was very disappointing and I will never recommend anyone to this location and to deal with the horrible customer service that we went through. At this point we felt enough was enough and told Tammy to bring her manger to speak with us. The manager then comes and she was very nice and was able to help with the situation.",

I was hesitant to go because of the  bad reviews, but it's just across the street. We were seated promptly and got our drinks soon after. The menu is a bit extensive.  So many choices.  After ordering we didn't  wait long. They brought the wrong  order. (A little confused because the orders were somewhat similar). A few minutes later we rec'd the correct meal. The servings are hearty and the eggs were perfect. The potato pancakes were actually pancakes with shredded potatoes cooked in. Different, but I liked it. My daughter loved the pancakes. Big and fluffy. The food was good  and except the earlier glitch, the service excellent.  We'll be returning.",

We saw that this had replaced Marie Calendar's, and my boyfriend read the reviews were good (turns out he read the Yelp reviews for a different location). So we decided to try here. I ordered two cheese enchiladas, my mom ordered a chimichanga, and my boyfriend ordered a bacon burger. My boyfriend loved it, but my mom and I thought ours were disgusting. The sauce on the enchilada was so strange... I don't even know how to describe it. The \"shell\" on the enchilada tasted and looked fake. My mom's chimichanga was full of peppers and onions. Refried beans were good. I was hungry and we bought it so I ate it. My mom ate a little of hers. Long story short, we all ran to the bathroom when we returned home. I still feel sick to my stomach. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 is because the waiters were nice. Bottom line? Don't go here if you want a good meal and a happy stomach after.",

    "text": "The people (at least the ones I follow - Jessica, Josh and Cesar) are still there and still excellent.  The food preparation has taken a hit recently; it's not as good as it used to be (seems like the cook staff is getting lazy), and the management is just plain apathetic.  The last three times the Orchid and I were in this place, there was one or more annoying, abrasive or just plain rude party making everyone else's lives miserable.  Now, we are aware that the trend in service management these days is to ignore the jerks and make the polite people bear it or leave.  We have in the past made comment to the management staff concerning the screeching children, the loud-to-the-point-of-pain raucous laughter, and the foul language of certain parties.  My mother, the most honorable Mama Hawk, and the politest person I know, attempted to light-heeartedly bring to the attention of the mother of the screeching child that he was causing the patrons around them to not enjoy their meal; this woman started screaming at my 88-year-old mother, complete with a litany of her \"right\" to eat wherever she pleased, and threats to my mother's health and well-being.  When management was notified of this incident, it was suggested that WE leave, as if we had been the offending party.  Jessica, Josh and Cesar - you've always been great, and we will miss you. Sylvia (management staff) - your attmept to insert yourself into the conversation I had with the other member of staff was unwelcome.  You don't know our family's history with the Blueberry Hill organization, nor do you know what really transpired the last three times we patronized your restaurant.  (For that matter, you don't know anything about the eight years we've done business with the Hill.)  You are not entitled to an opinion, and anything you attempted to say was unwelcome, unqualified, and, frankly, irrelevant. Male member of management staff (I think your name is \"Steve:\"  I thank you for listening to our complaint this time, but your droopy, three-quarters-asleep eyes gave me the impressuion that you were either too tired to be on duty or that you really didn't care what we thought.  So ... this will be the last time we patronize Blueberry Hill.  One star because Yelp says I can't give a zero but that's how I count it), and one for the three memebers of wait staff who do a wonderful job in spite of the environment they are forced to work in.  On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 15 ... five points for each of three wonderful servers.",

I feel like I would be doing a disservice to Blueberry Hill and it's possible patrons if I don't post a review on my recent visit.  First and foremost....PLEASE REMOVE the turkey dinner from your menu!  I've only been to your restaurant a couple of times and ordered breakfast both times.  In addition in both cases I visited the Decatur/W Charleston location.  I wouldn't have anything negative to say about my two previous visits.  On my most recent visit my husband and I stopped for a quick dinner on our way to a concert.  I love to have a traditional turkey dinner and have ordered that item at other restaurants with great enjoyment.  However on this occasion it was a colossal mistake.  Let me start with the gravy that covered every inch of my plate, first of all it was clear!  It had a weird gelatinous consistency and absolutely no flavor, matter of fact the entire dish had no flavor at all, I had to add salt and pepper to everything.  The stuffing, if you can call it that, was basically soggy bread crumbs.  The turkey was piled high but I'd prefer quality over quantity, although very dry it was at least edible once I scraped the gravy off.  The mashed potatoes were also edible without the gravy.  The corn was definitely straight out of a can but it was really the only item on the plate that I ate almost entirely.  I only wish I had taken a picture for further proof of just how horrible this menu item was.  If there were such thing as zero stars that what I would have given.  I implore Blueberry Hill to either remove or revamp this menu item.  On a positive note the Oreo cookie cake was very good.  But Being that my husbands meal, although edible wasn't much better than mine we've both vowed to NEVER eat at Blueberry Hill again.",

Their scrambled eggs were sloppy and kinda wet. The presentation blech, but kids ate it since they had to to obtain pancake heaven.  My potato pancake Benedict was awesome, but stingy on the hollandaise, one poached egg had about 1 tablespoon of sauce.   It was delicious, though. Top notch, just, I'll get more sauce next time.

Food was just ok. bacon way overcooked, pancakes are good, but really thick. Don't get the chunky potatoes, they are undercooked and flavorless.. honestly we have better breakfast at farmer boys and for half the price",

The steak was poor quality and the hash browns had a greening hue to them. I went back to try the honey coconut chicken and waffles which many had recommended on yelp. It was good but the chicken could use a bit more seasoning.",

The lady at the front when you walk in, and the lady who served us were both very kind and accomodating. This location was lively, filled with families. The decatur and charleston location isn't as full of energy just because of the crowd which is mostly seniors or office workers. Their restroom here was clean, unlike the location on flamingo and maryland. I ordered the Chicken Cutlets and Spinach Fettuccine Alfredo. It was mouth-watering and juicy, full of flavor but not too salty nor greasy.   One thing though, there was a 1x1cm piece of plastic in my fettuccine. Please be careful.",

I went years ago and had a hair in my honey coconut chicken so I stopped going.  Recently a friend suggested going there so I thought I'd give it a try. Basically in two weeks I have been here 3 times. All three times I asked if the carrot cake has buttercream or cream cheese frosting, NO ONE KNOWS! I get varying answers so last night the hostess offered me a very small slice, paper thin so I could find out, because carrot cake can only have cream cheese frosting or I won't eat it. But in this paper thin slice what did I find? A BLACK HAIR. A fairly decent sized one. Luckily I saw it first thing, I pointed it out and said hopefully the rest of the cake isn't like that. At this point I simply don't care what kind of frosting it is because I will sadly NEVER go again.  The cook I saw behind the line wasn't wearing a hair net or a hat either.  Sorry but when I have only been to a place maybe six or seven times in my life, years apart and I get hair in food twice it makes you wonder how much hair are you consuming that you don't catch.  Never again!!! Sorry not sorry.",

Hubby & I both ordered the mini veggie omelet with 2 pancakes special and it was not a MINI omelet! Probably more like 3 eggs, loaded with mushrooms, onions, green peppers and, the best part, small dice cheddar cheese (instead of shreds either in the middle or thrown on top), which gave you a tiny taste of salty cheese with each bite of omelet. The pancakes were fluffy. A lot of food for $8.99. Even tho they were very busy, our waitress was very friendly, and kept our coffee cups filled! So much better than overpriced hotel food!",

The building was renovated a couple years back and the interior looks great -- reminiscent of bakeries/cafes out east with dark wood accents and floral cushions. The place is spacious with comfortable booths found throughout and TVs scattered around the dining room. It's not just a breakfast spot either, their extensive menu spans breakfast, lunch and dinner with a decidedly American bent, but plenty of options like Mexican and Italian fare.   Their version of chicken and waffles ($9.79) consists of four small and breaded, coconut chicken tenders with just enough coconut flavor to taste without dominating the flavor. The waffle was pretty basic, but after pouring syrup on everything, it was delicious. Potato pancakes ($8.79) were pretty much giant hash browns. Three of them nicely fried and crispy. An order of kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.69) was massive. Much larger than any kid should eat and definitely large enough for 3 kids to share. The pancakes have chocolate in the batter and are topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. Clearly this isn't a healthy choice, but fuck it... I have a sweet tooth and so does my kid.  Service was less than stellar with a grumpy older lady taking our orders and occasionally checking back on us. For those who don't want to sit at a table or booth, there's a bar area just inside the main dining room.   3.5 Stars",

I ordered the classic turkey dinner which was $12.99 for a complete turkey dinner which included, soup or salad, drink and any dessert! The sage stuffing was delicious and the gravy was so tasty! They really packed on the turkey which was tender along with stuffing, mashed taters and corn.  My guest ordered the cherry glazed Ham dinner which included, soup or salad, drink and any dessert for $12.99.  This was a lot of food and both of our meals were delicious! This was a Holiday special keep in mind however I would make a visit even if not a holiday to have a turkey dinner which is always on their menu!  I really enjoyed this new location as it was clean, bright and comfortable.  The dessert counter looks Amazing as you walk in the front door. The hardest part was deciding on what dessert to order at the end which we asked them to pack up to go.  We will be back for sure to enjoy a nice restaurant meal and experience!",

I don't want to play the race card either but I'm a brown skinned woman and I was eating alone just a table for one and No one came to check on me, never received my food only water after almost 2 hours had approached and I decided to walk out and leave.",

It wasn't hot to the point the cheese did not even melt. Traded it in for chicken noodle soup. It was HOT but the veggies and noodles were soggy, not chewable. The gravy was a strange consistency probably homemade because it was lumpy. Stick to fried foods!",

The only down side is the onions were not a cooked as I like and some were very crunchy. I am used to the onions on the patty melt being cooked until soft. Other than that it was good. This by far is not a phenomenal place to eat, but it does the trick especially at breakfast. I would recommend it if you want breakfast and diner style food, but if you are looking for the best of the best this is not your place. We will be back from time to time.",

It's a nice family restaurant with the expected atmosphere. The wait staff was very nice. Back to the pork chops, they are offered two different ways. You get two when you order and since my wife didn't know Erich way would taste best she asked if she could get one of both. We were told they normally don't do that, but since it was slow she would ask. The waitress didn't come back so we assumed it was ok. Our food came out and there we two of the breaded pork chops. That's when we were told that they wouldn't do one of each. That's understandable, but it would have been nice if she would have asked my wife which way she preferred them. The pork chops were bland and unevenly cooked. She had to douse the potatoes and gravy on top of the chops just to get them down. Sad to say they didn't hit the spot.  I ordered the Oreo chocolate pancakes that were VERY rich and sweet. I enjoyed what I could.  There were other service issues, however, the waitress seemed to know we weren't satisfied and tried to make up for it the best she could.  Bottomline, the service was pretty good, meat portions not so much.",

Upon arriving to the restaurant, I checked in with them to let them know I was there to pick up. The person working the counter didn't ask who the order was for or anything, just said \"oh it will be a few minutes.\" After waiting for over 30 minutes, I approached Steve at the hostess counter and confirmed he was the manager. After simply asking what was taking the order so long, he proceeded to be very rude and say things like \"well I have over 100 customers in here right now\" and \"Maybe you shouldn't accept orders from us next time\"and \"Grubhub isn't the only delivery platform so I'll just cancel\" I was trying to remain professional during this whole thing but Steve made it impossible to do so. What he should of said was \"let me check on that for you.\" But no, instead Steve was very unprofessional. After I asked another employee if the order was done, he put his hands on my shoulders in an attempt to move me out of public eye and into the kitchen. After instructing Steve to not put his hands on me, I willingly moved into the kitchen to hopefully get an answer.  Steve then claims to be the owner of all Blueberry Hill locations all of sudden and brings the employee that supposedly takes the online orders into the situation and she proceeds to verbally attack me even though I never said a word to her. Come to find out, the customer's food had been sitting on the kitchen out window the whole time I was there from the beginning.",

Our server took a while to come to us but water and menus were brought to us by staff right after we were seated. I just wished their portions were bigger for the french toast. We paid as we exit but was unsure on where to pay at first no one came back to check on us and the bill was just left in the table by the server",

The meat looked like it was cooked yesterday and it took 45 Mins to get out food. They got the order wrong for the French fries them took another 20 mins to bring the right fries. I would defiantly not recommend this to anyone . Save your money and cook at home.",

My party and I were in a hurry and the gentleman at the cash register must have been doing a drawer change and said that he would be 3 minutes. Uh.. We didn't have 3 minutes so we just left more than enough money and left.  They would have gotten 5 stars if the food was better and the service at check out was more prompt.",

At this new location the workers there are super nice and look clean (if that makes any sense). I never know what to order so I asked the waiter what she recommends i only knew I wasn't pancakes and she suggested the potato pancakes. My first thought is yea sure lets see how this goes. My mother always orders the same thing fresh fruit creeps .   When my order came the pancakes look like hash brown. I knew I was going to like it because I love anything made with potato. But these pancakes where amazing. I tried it with Apple sauce and cream cheese. But I enjoyed it with maple syrup. It's like hash brown but sweeter. I will order only this from now on.   I love the cleanliness of the  restaurant And how it looks and feel like a house . The pies look amazing in the entrance.",

I work a restaurant and there is no way that I'm going to respond to a customer in such a way that this waitress did let alone make them wait for 20 minutes just to place an order.

This surprised me though because there were plenty of people waiting in the lobby, but I can only assume they were larger parties.  Blueberry Hill has one of the LARGEST menu's I have ever seen. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and are open 24/7. The breakfast menu alone is around 4 pages long. I am the most indecisive person, so it took me some time to figure out what I wanted. I finally decided to get the chicken fried steak which comes with hash browns, eggs and toast. My friend got the Irish eggs benedict. Our server was nice but I didn't even get her name. She just kinda wandered by and took our order. Someone else brought us our coffee and water. I am not complaining, just saying that it felt a lot more informal than I am used to at most restaurants.  The food came out quickly and everything was delicious. I really enjoyed the chicken fried steak, and the gravy that came on top was really good. This place is also a bakery, and they have delicious cakes and pies for sale.",

But now the Food!!!  I ordered the combo with steak, eggs and pancakes and a piece of apple pie from the best waitress this side of Heaven! If she hadn't been married and me being marriage adverse...I would of proposed on the spot and gone to visit Elvis downtown. She knew how to make a Man happy!  I really enjoyed the Steak, it was covered with grilled onions it was tender easy to cut and chew and packed with flavor. I had the scrambled Eggs they were fine as well...I didn't have any more room for the Pancakes and they did look dead sexy at the time.  The waitress said they are the best pancakes in Vegas, I will have to take her word on that because heating them up 24 hours later in the Microwave they were well...not so great.  The Dutch Apple Pie slice, she recommended to me as I was paying my bill was fanlickentastic. I want to go back an order a full pie ASAP!    As the King would say, \"Gimme some Sugar Baby\"",

    "text": "Just a few minutes off the main drag lies a hidden gem of a restaurant known as Blueberry Hill. And it's damn delicious. I love the cozy vibe inside this place. It's like a diner ate another diner and created this place. Loads of seating. We got in for brunch on a Saturday with no wait at around noon. WINNER.  The menu is ridiculous. And by that I mean ridiculously GOOD. I love options, especially when they're all within the same style of cooking (i.e. they don't overreach). This place delivers a ton of variations of classic American diner dishes that make my mouth water.   POTATO PANCAKE EGGS BENEDICT. If you are in any way a lover of poached eggs in hollandaise sauce, this is it, man. I misread the description and assumed that the English muffin was replaced by the potato pancake, but you get BOTH. Carbs upon carbs upon carbs to wash away my bad decisions. Or maybe yours. I don't really drink. But this is the ultimate hangover cure. That hollandaise sauce is bomb. Perfectly poached eggs. Potato pancake that makes my Jewy heart sing. English muffin lost in all the madness, but swimming in yolk and sauce and deliciousness. Oh yeah, and there was fruit somewhere on the side. I left a very clean plate that would make my grandmother proud.   And of course I tried all my friends' plates; isn't that normal?   Fries and ranch: what the fuck is in this crack ranch?! IT'S SO GOOD. I didn't even need the fries so much as my finger, but let's face it, I'm a somewhat classy lady. I couldn't do that. Not with so many occupied tables nearby. -_-  Biscuits and Gravy: ENORMOUS portion! Enough to feed a linebacker. Biscuits so fluffy, I could sleep on them. Gravy so divine, I felt like I was in the south.   Chocolate chip pancakes: one of the lesser indulgences on their sweet menu, but my friend didn't leave a bite on that plate. Plus points for serving sugar-free maple syrup so he could pretend like he wasn't one step closer to full-blown Diabetes for polishing off that meal.   Service was so excellent. Our server, whose name I have now forgotten since it's been a few weeks, was on top of his game. Super friendly. Chatted with us about lots of random stuff. The meal was very reasonably-priced and I left feeling like I had made the best decision of our whole trip by coming here. What  can I say? I love food.  My only thought once we drove away was: \"WHY DIDN'T WE GET PIE?!?!\"",

    "text": "After searching hi and low (I asked a local where to get good local breakfast).  He said, \"Blueberry Hill.\"  So my colleauge joined me and off we went and called Uber.  In 20 minutes, we got to Blueberry, sat down and ordered a nice homemade meal. I'd have to say their chicken waffles was really good.  Chicken was very crunchy and moist. Even their black coffee was not too bad (and for being a coffee connoisseur, you get my drift).  Overall, service was excellent, our waiter (he must have been with Blueberry Hills for quite a while) because he had a lot of stories about Vegas oh years ago!!  I think before I was even born!!  Hahahah :p  By the way, that was the highlight of our visit.  He was such a cool guy!  We would come back just for his stories and his great optimism of life!  Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p",

    "text": "When I first came to Las Vegas seven years ago I ate at the BH on Decatur at Charleston. It was disastrous. Another year or two went by and I figured that it was a fluke. No, no, I had an almost identical experience and said, \"Never again!\"   Now, years later, I was talked into going to a different BH on West Flamingo.   This is what happened: The table staff started to pour coffee into a cup that was clearly dirty. The staff was looking directly into the cup and beginning to pour when I pointed out how dirty the cup was.   Back with a new cup, he filled it and left. I looked around the table for some Half and Half and there wasn't any. Lots of chemical choices but I don't like the aftertaste. I had to wait a considerable time to get H&H and by then my coffee was cold.   The restroom: Only one toilet (!) and it was filthy. I haven't felt the need to use a tissue toilet seat cover for probably 30 years but I had to at BH.  Then the hand dryer just made a little rattling noise and put out no air.  Bye, this time for good. There is no excuse for this level of institutional ineptitude and mismanagement.",

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in town! It's always open, the food is always excellent, and it's cheap. As you walk in, there's many different desert options on display, just like Cheesecake Factory. This spot used to be a Marie Calenders, so I'm not sure if they're just taking advantage of the display cases that were already installed, or if they are filling the desert market that the closure of Marie Calenders left behind, but either way, it's awesome.  If you're a regular Blueberry Hill fan, this is the best location. It's the only one that serves alcohol. It's centrally located, and the go to place after a night of drinking and partying, especially if you still want to drink some more. During the day, the parking lot is quite busy, and that's a pain, but that's the only downside.   For pancake lovers, one tip I have is don't order the specialty pancakes by themselves, they're pretty expensive. Instead, order a dish that comes with pancakes then request the specialty ones instead. It only costs a little more, and you get the full meal too. It seem they have a dollar per customer number to hit, which of course, we all understand.",

To get to the minimum delivery amount, I also ordered meatloaf, which came with a side; I chose chili. The order arrived. I got back to my room and there is no cake, the only thing I wanted.   I called the restaurant and Autumn tells me that she's absolutely sure that she packed the cake. I call the driver who says the woman didn't go over the order with her the way she usually does to ensure everything is there. I do the live chat with @Grubhub and they offered $3 for the cake.   After talking to the driver, I called the restaurant again. Autumn answers the phone and, lo and behold, her story has changed. Somehow, there were TWO orders at the same time of meatloaf with a side of chili and chocolate cake. What are the odds?! And because the restaurant was so busy, she put the chocolate cake in with the other order. Never an apology, never a \"we'll get this right,\" just a \"we were really busy and I put the cake in the other bag.\"   Interestingly, when GrubHub called me, the guy said Autumn told him that SHE wasn't the one who packed my order. It was now \"the new girl\" who doesn't know the difference between one container and two. The solution offered by the restaurant is that I could come in and get the cake THEY forgot to pack. Now... if I had wanted to go to a restaurant, why would I have used GrubHub in the first place? I'd spend more on a cab than the cake was worth.  I tried one bite of the meatloaf and it was dry and flavorless. Had I been in the restaurant, I would have sent it back. It was inedible. There are hundreds of restaurant in Las Vegas. Avoid this one.",

Our server was Xenia( I hope I spelled it right). She was very attentive and was very pleasant. I had plenty of food and then some to take home. My kids scarfed down there food. I will definitely come back. When I left and got home I realized that I left my phone. I drove back to the restaurant thinking it would not be there, still. However our waitress and Jessica had found it and held it for me. Thank you Soo much. I will be recommending this location. For its awesome food and exceptional service. Thank you",

Though the meal we consumed was what we could describe as \"school cafeteria food.\" My guests had consumed the Italian meatloaf, there was almost no taste of seasonings, and the spaghetti had the taste of canned food. Our waiter was on top however until when it was time to get our receipt, she didn't come for almost 10 minutes. The desert was not the best either which was highly upsetting. Chocolate pie and strawberry cake was what we ate after. The pie had a weird after taste and the strawberry cake felt canned as well. The whipped cream was the best from these. Because of these, we might not ever return.",

Walked in for dinner before trick or treating with my family which included myself, husband, nanny and two toddler children. We all had our costumes on (hello it's Halloween) immediately the host informed me we she couldn't seat us because there were no masks allowed in the restaurant so I offered to pull it up to my hair (like a headband) to which she immediately said she'd have to check with her manager and let me know. In the meanwhile my children start wondering what we did wrong. The host comes back and says that we need to pull our masks completely off our face/heads and then we could be seated. I understand that for safety reasons lone masked people should probably be asked to take off their masks but I had two toddlers ! What did they think we were going to do ? Perhaps they should close this location for Halloween if they can't use their common sense that a mom with two kids under five isn't going to hold them up for some pancakes.  The waitress apologized but the host had already taken our happy vibes away. That sucks",

Local and casual... server never let our coffee get below half a cup, portions were huge and even through we were all tasting each other's tasty dishes, nobody could finish their own.

On top of that some of our food didn't even come out right, like we had ordered it, so we had to wait even longer. They never came back with my lemons for my water. It took asking three different servers until we got what we asked for. I used to come to Blueberry Hill all the time when I was younger, but now, the food isn't as good and the service was really bad. I'm not surprised with how many people were actually dining there when we were there. None of the food was fantastic, mediocre at best. Our waitress didn't even seem like she wanted to be there. Everytime we asked her something, she didn't really have a direct answer for us. This location is definitely one that I don't care to go back to anytime soon.",

I had the waffles with fresh fruits and boy it was delicious. The waffle batter was really good the waffle was nice, golden and crispy. The service was good. Our waitress was really nice and polite it was so much on the menu we couldn't decide   took a while to figure out what we wanna eat.

We went in for breakfast on a Saturday around 9 in the morning, and the place had a really nice diner vibe with lots of people and great smelling food in the air. We were seated in a booth almost immediately, and had a really nice waitress who had the diner customer service (sassy :D)attitude down. We were very amused with her throughout our meal, and she answered all our menu questions with expertise. I got a blueberry muffin, still warm out of the oven, and a bacon salsa omelette thing that I can't remember the name of. Both were delicious. My mom got pancakes, and definitely bit off more than she could chew as the portions here are huge. The coffee was also quite good.   We liked it so much that we went back for breakfast on Monday around 7 before Mom flew out, and it was just a good of food. It was a different vibe as we were one of three parties in the place, but the waitress did a great job of making sure all were attended to and had plenty of coffee.   This place is definitely going to be a tradition when I have family visit in town, and I'm happy I found a nice laid back diner that I can take people to. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "Great spot for breakfast and more.  Very extensive menu.  Nice location in the SW and close to the strip but with somewhat limited parking.  Sunday's can be really busy but as of yet when this review is written  and while this location is rather new, the weekdays are not that busy. This place reminded me of diners and family restaurants up in the Chicagoland area where I used to live.  It really had that big city vibe on that Sunday I went.  The countertop  seating  not facing the kitchen was a nice touch and is good for a solo dining experience and to do some B.S ing with the staff.  Had the vegetarian omelette which was fluffy, big and and tasty with 3 homemade pancakes as a side which were also fluffy and good.  The waitress was on top of it and often offered refills for the coffee.   Here what their site says:  \"All our Beef is U.S.D.A. Certified Choice Beef Our Coffee is 100% Columbian, not a blend Our Eggs are Certified by the U.S.D.A as Grade AA, the highest in the industry for quality and safety, and are size extra-large. Fresh Blueberries Our Bacon and Sausage are 100% Oscar Mayer. Our orange juice is 100% pure juice, no water, no preservatives, never frozen, not from concentrate. All our fruit compotes are homemade in our kitchens, not from the can. Every fruit compote will be served with slices of fresh fruit on top. Strawberries when out of season will be frozen\".  Next got try some of their coconut honey battered dishes.  Its sound great.",

They have a very large breakfast menu and if you aren't from Las Vegas this may be a place that you will lo ve to eat at but for me it wasn't worth the hype. I don't eat pork so it limits my breakfast options but when i went in i had the the chicken and waffles which was VERY disappointing. The waffle was good but the meat was horrible,  I don't even think i can honestly call it chicken, it was bland, and chewy i was actually scared to eat it. But I do give the manager credit because they noticed that I did not eat it and only charged me for a waffle. I don't think I will ever go back to eat at a Blueberry Hill just isn't the place for me.",

Food is good and cheap, and they provide excellent service. Service was a big plus here, they  will actually speak to you and wait you unlike the service you receive on the strip.

    "text": "After having so-so experiences at two other Blueberry Hill locations, I decided to give this new one a try, mainly because it's conveniently only a few blocks from home. I was impressed by the new style of the interior, much more modern than the other ones. Unfortunately that's where my being impressed stopped.  We seated ourselves and were attended to quickly enough. Our server, whose name escapes me now, wasn't really rude, just kinda snippy with us when we asked questions, like if I could have my burger with no onions. She said it doesn't come with onions and they had to be requested, and I pointed out the top of the burger page where it very clearly says that the burgers come \"dressed with lettuce, tomato, grilled or raw onions and pickle\", and she insisted I was reading it wrong and seemed to speak to me like I was a dummy. Whatever, I worked all night and I'm not looking for a debate for my breakfast/dinner, I just want to eat. We settled on the breakfast of champions: two orders of bacon cheeseburger & fries. As I sat waiting for my food, I noticed that my fork was pretty dirty. I really didn't want to be \"that guy\" and gripe about a dirty fork, especially because I wasn't going to use it anyway, so I cleaned it with a napkin and put it back. The server brought out our drinks and two glasses of water.   When the meals came out, I was really expecting more. For $9.59 I got a medium size burger on a slightly hard bun, and what seemed to be a handful of fries. On the side were 3 sad-looking pickle chips - I guess a whole pickle, or at least a lengthwise slice, would be too extravagant. Having dealt with BH before, I knew better than to ask for some cole slaw, because that's going on the bill. The food tasted good enough, but I really cannot justify paying almost $10 for a skimpy plate of mediocre food.  What really ruined the experience for me was when I finished my iced tea, and went to drink the glass of water. My glass, which I hadn't really paid any mind to until then, was filthy. Hopefully it wasn't dirt, just residue from their dish detergent, but I still wouldn't want to drink from it, even with a straw. By this time I was truly over BH, and still wasn't feeling like arguing, so we paid the tab and left. I mentioned to the cashier about the glass while we paid and she went in the kitchen and scolded someone as we were walking out the door.  Like the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a first impression, so I can now say that I'm truly done with Blueberry Hill - if you need me, I'll be at the Black Bear stuffing myself on huge, worth-the-price portions and dealing with friendly people.",

My friend ordered meat loaf..the menu read Home cooking. It was a big mistake to assume \"home style cooking\"meant they made a good meat loaf...or dessert. The plate of food looked like cafeteria food. Nothing on it was the least bit appetizing. Granted meat loaf is rather ugly..food looked plastic & lifeless.  My slice of cake - dryyyy, The frosting was ok.. I was truly disappointed because their display case was really well done..We barely ate the food.  Place has a big menu.

I ate some strange concoction that involved a grilled biscuit, topped with meat loaf, strips of bacon, served with a side of mashed potatoes and veg.  Everything was covered in a thick layer of country gravy.  It was a little spicy.  It was really good, but it was so heavy I was not able to eat for 6 hours - and I didn't even finish half.  We also had a pretty good pasta dish.   Unfortunately, the waitress didn't offer and desert so we just left although the deserts looked good in the case - mostly cakes.   I would try this place again, but I think I would split a meal.  The portion sizes are off the chart - which is a good thing.   The side dishes are a little wanting.  The steamed veg not so good.  Mashed potatoes not bad.  The county gravy needed more meat, but was passable.  The bacon was top notch.  The decor is basically a Marie Calendar's location that closed.  Traffic in and out of the parking lot is a nightmare.  The place is huge inside, but strangely laid out in odd seating sections.",

    "text": "My friends & I decided to check out this location because it is new.  The hostess sat us down & we skimmed our menu.  I ordered the Oreo pancakes & my two friends ordered a simple breakfast platter & fried chicken.  We waited almost an hour for our food. The old guy who got seated after us (he looked like a regular) got his food almost immediately along with a few more tables surrounding us.  The bar was empty so they were not that busy.  When we tried to ask for our waitress, the man we tried to flag down just ignored us thinking \"you are not my table....\"  All our food came out one at a time in about 5 minute increments.  My pancakes were still soggy/wet/uncooked in the middle.  The waitress asked us if there was anything else we needed to which I replied, \"sugar-free syrup.\" I had to repeat myself because she did not listen the first time.  Overall, the long wait, the food being undercooked, the attitudes that the waitress & another worker gave us made the experience very upsetting.  I, along with my friends, will never go back to this place again!!!",

    "text": "I heard great things about this place so I went and I was highly dissapointed. I ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine and they were the worst I ever had. The hollandaise sauce was flavorless, which makes up the dish. The English muffins were soggy. We also ordered a chicken omelette and the eggs were overcooked. How do you overcook eggs????  Besides for the food, there was an intoxicated patron inside laughing and being extremely loud. I would have expected an employee to tell him to keep it down or get him out. I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I ordered the wrong plates. Highly disappointed tho.",

Everything came out cold & bland. Perfectly cut square potatoes they just put into the microwave & watered down drinks. SO disappointed!!!",
