    "text": "Tender is located inside the Luxor Hotel, Ate here because I was fiending for a nice piece of steak, and heard they they have fresh seafood and meat flown in daily.   Can't complain about the service because our waiter was awesome.  The head chef also made his way to our table making sure we were well taken care of, and asking us how are food was.  The decor was elegant and classy red walls, dim lighting good ambiance.   Started off with the wild mushroom soup, damn i really wish they gave me a bigger portion of this soup because it was absopositively delicisous.  Never had anything like it.  I ordered their prime rib, but to tell you the truth it was whatevs, I was more into the wild mushroom soup then the prime rib lol.  Although the prime rib was a really nice cut, I couldnte even finish it all.    Overall great restaraunt out of the many restaraunts in vegas.  Pricey, but they have prix fixe menu's for that.",

I ordered the chef's special as an appetizer, which were multi colorted heirloom tomatoes, with basil, buffalo mozzarella, with garlic evoo.  Very good, but a little pricey  for just tomatoes and cheese!  As an entree I ordered the filet mignon which tasted like butter! It was cooked to perfection, my bf had the ribeye which also was prepared to a tee.  As a side we shared the grilled aspargus drizzled with lemon evoo.  I was a little disappointed with it, not quite as crunchy/flavorful as I would have liked.  When we had finished out meal, the waiter came out with a cake and a candle.  I had completely forgotten that I had wrote on the reservations request online, that it was my bf's birthday!! They had actually read it and remembered!! I was very impressed with that gesture, as well as the excellent service, nice place, cozy, romantic, would definately recommend trying!!",

They were great - sat down our party of five, got us drinks and food superfast, but didn't rush us, and got us out and to the show (unfortunately).   We had the surf and turf burger (HOW DECADENT! kobe beef and lobster?!?) which was one of the most amazing things ever. Also the trio of soups (delicious, but it wasn't steak so not as spectacular as it could've been), the ONION RINGS which somehow were as melty and  incredible as a hot Krispy Kreme donut, the roasted carrots (YUM) and the blue cheese bacon iceberg wedge. Which was also fantastic.  It was all good good, good, so good. OH and the best Mojito I've had, like, anywhere. It was fabulous. We should've stayed there all night instead of rushing off to that absolutely godawful show.",

We were staying at the luxor, and we decided to stay \"in\" for the night, but didn't want to go out on the strip for a good dinner.  After reading the other reviews on yelp, I decided this place was worth trying.    We had to wait maybe 15 mins for a table, but had a really good drink at the bar, so it wasn't a bad wait. After finally being seated, we decided the wait was worth it.  They seated us to a very nice, intimate booth.  Right away we could tell this place was great.    We started out with an iceberg lettuce salad, I had the 2.25 lb lobster, and my husband had the angus ribeye.  My husband requested his steak medium rare plus, and most places don't ever get this right.  His steak was cooked to perfection.  My lobster was brought to me in a covered dish, with a lobster bisque type sauce, which was delicious, even though I usually prefer my lobster plain.  For dessert, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake, which the waiters presented me the cake with a candle and chocolate \"happy birthday\" design.    Tender is definitely worth checking if you want a fabulous steak or surf and turf dinner!",

The pros:  oysters were good as well as the wild game tasting (don't forget to eat the marrow).  cons: bad service, the waiter avoided our table after the food runner poured oyster ice down the side of my friend.  He was MIA for most of the meal. The supposed diver caught jumbo scallops were gritty, all five of them! (which make me wonder if they really were diver caught - me thinks not!)  - the grittiness left what looked to be promising - inedible.  My other dinning companions ordered steaks and they were under seasoned and left us underwhelmed.  The rest of the sides, (grilled asparagus, exotic grains tasting trio and fingerling potatoes) while good, nothing worth mentioning other than they didn't suck.  Oh the sauteed Hudson Valley foie gras was delicious. Unless i go on a bender, i wouldn't go back to tender.",

Each couple had a My Vegas Rewards voucher, not problem using both, plus we also each had a $20 credit from the coupon book that the Luxor gave us at check it, great deal.  Our bills each came to over $150, but with a huge tip on the full price of our meals we still spent less than $100.  My husband and I started with drinks.  He had an IPA beer and I had the Red Maiden off their cocktail menu.  Delish.  For appetizer my husband had the Big Eye Tuna platter, his favorite was the planks.  I had the Mushroom Soup (amazing, def. A+ for flavor, I am very picky about my mushroom soups, have had a lot in my day).  For Dinner I had the range-fed beef, Silver Fern Farms, New Zealand. Medium Rare, it was cooked perfect, no need for a sauce, it was great all on it's own.  Very juicy and filling at 12oz.  My husband had the range-fed, Silver Fern Farms, New Zealand beef with a side of bearnaise sauce.  Honestly he didn't need the sauce, it was great on his own, but he wanted sauce.  The sides are large enough to share so we shared the lyonnaise potato gratin roasted onion & cheddar sauce with sour cream & chives.  Amazing and it went great with the meat.  We even had a little left over. We chose not to have dessert as we were already full and it was 11:00, late night dinner as we flew into Vegas that night.  Our waiter was very good at helping us with info on the food items and taking care to use our vouchers.  He was very friendly and quick to take care of our bill so that we could head out for a great night of fun.  Though the food is expensive, we easily spend the same amount in Portland, Oregon on the same type of food with the same quality.  In Vegas it is pretty expected to drop money on a nice dinner out.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting, yet not overly hush hush, as we were in Vegas and wanted to have a great time and not into the romantic.  If you were there for romance, ask for a corner or side booth.",

    "text": "Wasn't expecting to like this place.  Fine dining and the pyramid don't really go together, but wanted to eat in house.  Clearly the best place in the joint is Cathouse, but didn't book that early enough because of questions of whether it was inappropriate for a 13 year old girl.  Wanted to try a different place (company?) but kept getting steered to Tender.  Very surprised when I saw it, it is a beautiful space.  I believe it is very new as there were not yet even the directional signs for it in the lobby.  Actually, was pleasantly surprised by look of all the various restaurants and lounges in the Luxor.  The wines by the glass list was fantastic.  It's probably a bad thing that I knew all the wines since I don't really know as much as I would like about wine, but nevertheless I knew all the offerings and, better yet, liked them all.  So that was positive.  The menu looked absolutely fantastic.  So many choices that looked appealing.  Started with the ceasar salad since that is a True way to determine if a place is good or not, by the quality of their ceasar.  This one, not so good.  Trio of soups was equally uninsprining, the butternut squash/apple was decent, but the wild mushroom and the lobster/crab both just tasted like cream.  Got the Japanese Wagyu fillet (I just can't help myself).  Was it like True Japanese Wagyu?  No.  Was it one of the best fillets I have ever eaten.  Probably.  Does that make it worth the three digit price tag?  Probably not.  Aly wasn't too impressed with the menu so I suggested that she get the lobster.  It came in a ramekin that was probably four inches in diameter.  When a thirteen year old girl who eats more than a quarter of the food on her plate about once in a blue moon finishes everything in two minutes and then jokes \"well, I guess I am done with my lobster\", you know the portion is a little light.  They do have a larger lobster on the menu, but the meat from a 1-1/4 pounder should have been plenty.  She liked the mashed potatoes.  I liked the approach for the creamed spinach.  They don't cook the spinach to death like most places do, it is still kind of fresh.  The garlic cream sauce was also pretty good, but the entire dish was ruined by too much salt.  Doubt I will go back because if I ever eat in the Luxor again I want to try Cathouse, but if the situation arose I would not hesitate to go back to Tender.",

I was impressed by the meat selection, but the cut I got just wasn't good. It was a thinly-cut Kansas City Strip (bone-in). I love bone-in steaks because the meat close to the bone is great and very flavorful. Ordered medium-rare. It came out barely medium, pretty much well at the edges and MAYBE medium by the bone. I asked the server what he thought and he started writing something down without answering me. He acted like he didn't wanna offer me a new one, and since I was with a group of people who had to get to a show, I chose to just eat it. Pretty much just your average char-grilled outback-style strip steak. Except it was almost $50. Not gonna give them any more money, that's for sure. That server should've looked at my steak and immediately said, yeah, it's not quite right, let's get you another one. The sauces/complements were very good, and the New York boneless cut that my buddy ordered was fine. Nothing special here. Plenty of better options on the strip.",

In addition, the soup trio was really good, and all sides ordered were enjoyed thoroughly.  To top it off, they sent us a cake & ice cream dish after the main course. Not necessary but very appreciated!  The prices are definitely on the higher end, but I do feel it's justified by the high quality of food and preparation. I've been to many other steakhouses on the Strip, and I would not hesitate to place Tender in the upper echelon.  All in all, a wonderful experience.",

The crab deshelled, which was perfect. The filet was so tender. It was the best filet , I have ever had. The crab was thick, sweet and plenty of it.  My husband ** steak. And creamed spinach. The steak was also excellent. The creamed spinach was too rich for me but he loves it.   We tried the maple bourbon honey, Hawaiian honey and Las Vegas honey with vanilla cream. All delicious . My favorite was the maple honey.   The iced tea I ordered was awful. changed for a decay coffee and at was good.",

We got the seafood tower, tomahawk steak,3 sides and bone marrow...it fed 3 of us with extras! We might have over done it in the amount of food but  everything was just so delicious. Our waiter was also amazing and been there for 23 yrs (who would guess we'd get the waiter from Hawaii). I often judge other servers by how empty my water gets before refilling...not even half way, not once! When in Vegas this will def be my go to steak house!",

A woman at the table next to ours harassed everyone who came over to their table, including the host, servers, the manager, and a photographer employed by the restaurant, to ask for free stuff for her friend who was getting married (it was a small bachelorette party crew). She degraded them about their job, demanded free things, complained about and haggled their prices, harassed them to get them to bachelorette photos with the women that were in poor taste etc etc. The waitstaff went above and beyond to be patient with this woman and we watched from our table as they accommodated the women far beyond what they should have, and tried to politely shut down the situation. The woman was particularly rude to the photographer, a young woman who looked visibly uncomfortable but remained cool and professional the entire time. These people totally kept it all together and were kind in the face of utter disrespect and obnoxiousness and we wanted to let them know we saw them handle the situation like total rock stars.",

Our appetizer was the salon sampler.  I'm new to eating fish, but I enjoyed each item. For my main course, I had the 8oz New Zealand filet with blue cheese topping. Yum! Also a side of creamy mashed potatoes and a wonderful wedge salad that was very fresh!   I had to try the bread pudding for dessert...it was good, but I didn't want to finish it. It was very delicate and refined. I was hoping for something a bit more classic.   The food was moderately priced for a steakhouse and pretty decent quality. The drinks really bumped the bill up at our table by quite a bit (6 cocktails total). I'd recommend sharing a bottle or two at the table rather than pricey cocktails.",

I sent it back and didn't reorder as the 20 Oz rib eye on the plate of Lady beside was so big she wouldn't finish it. Well we both didn't finish it because it was so tough and had no flavor.   The chef nor the manager EVER came to our table. I sought the manager out privately and told him our issues. He did apologize but he NEVER came to the table. They still CHARGED me for the steak I sent back.  The liquor selection is better at  at the airport.  The service was ok. I actually felt bad for the waiter but in the end he did nothing to correct anything.  So my advice... there are literally dozens of better places to drop this kind of money in Vegas and actually enjoy it.",

I would definitely order this exact pairing over and over and over again.   Many from our party had the steak mentioned that it was perfect.  Our sides included lobster risotto (wowzers), mashed potatoes (creamy) and the mac n' cheese which was sub par. Stick with their specialties.

We had several different \"servers,\" couldn't tell you which was ours or if they were a server, but we were definitely an afterthought, even though we made reservations. And we felt as though we were in the server's quarters. They were clanging dishes, making loud noises doing the normal server stuff that most servers do behind kitchen doors, in front of us.   You really pay for the service and if you are charging a certain amount, you should be getting that quality of service. They needs to take giant leaps forward... would never, ever return.",

Granted the apps were a little pricey but what isn't at these restaurants right?! I digress - why talk about the money in Vegas.  It was a party of 12 so we ordered just about every appetizer there was on the menu - the escargot was delicious, but comes in services of 4 per order - the entire time I was thinking about how much escargot I could get a the buffet down the street!! LOL  For our main, I ordered their Rib-eye steak, medium rare and the wife ordered a filet mignon. I have to say, my 20oz piece of steak was DELICIOUS - it was the way I wanted it cooked - crispy on the outside, juicy inside.   TENDER may very well be added to the family destination for Vegas from now on...will have to return for a second time to see if the service and food is consistent - then it'll become a family tradition!!!",

Here is what we ordered:  Lemon Drop martini: it was very well made, strong, but was tasteful. 5/5 Lobster Bisque: It was warm, not hot, and it was good but a bit too...buttery. 3/5 8oz Angus Filet Minon: Cooked perfectly (medium), very tender, took it without sauce since I like to savor the taste of meat and it was delicious. 5/5 Kansas Rib Eye?: Asked for medium, it was very RARE. We both cant eat rare meat and it was NOT cooked correctly that my boyfriend pretty much had a piece then ate off my plate. 1/5 Yukon mashed potatoes: moist, very good. 5/5 Grilled asparagus: Cant really mess these up. 5/5 Cheesecake: VERY creamy, chocolate topping was very sweet, crust was delicious. 4/5 Chocolate cake: its not really a cake as much a souffle, very sweet and creamy, wish there was more of the break part. 3/5  On a brighter note, my boyfriend shared our experience with the manager and he comped our desserts but we were pretty much done with dinner so we declined to have the steak recooked. We had a food comp to use so it wasnt too much of a hassle for us but if we were paying out of pocket I would have been VERY upset.  The ambiance on the other hand was dim-lit, we had two waiters, one was good but one was very slow, took a LONG time for absolutely everything. They also keep your waters next to you in this little hanger thing so everytime the waiter for the table next to us needed to grab water or drinks for the table next to us, I felt like our privacy was a but invaded. The decor is beautiful but the music they play is NOT correlated well with the ambiance of a steakhouse, it lowered the quality a bit. I would not bring children, its a great place for small parties I saw many parties of 4 dining here, but it doesnt seem to be very packed....is it due to the quality of food? Who knows?",

Potato was 15.00, vegetable was 12.00, salad was 15.00 if you wanted to add that! Are you kidding???? The place looked like it used to be maybe a cafeteria, not a romantic dining place and we would NEVER pay a price like that, all dinners should come with a veggie and potato for that price, Lobster was like 85.00 and that was JUST the Lobster. We drank our drink and paid and left, went over to the Pub next door at the Mandalay Bay and ate like King and Queens and the price was great! We won't ever be back to Tender!",

Highs and Lows:  - The bread and pumpkin seed pesto was delicious.   - The photographer kept lurking around.  Annoying. - The shrimp cocktail was delicious, but not enough.  It came with 4, which is probably normal, but they served it with a number of different dipping sauces, which only accentuated that there were only 4 shrimp. - I got the filet mignon.  I ordered medium, but this was definitely medium rare.  Still good enough to finish. - The husband got the porterhouse.  He would have picked up the bone and gnawed on it if I would've let him.  It was that delicious.  He also got the mushroom sauce, which he loved. - The green bean casserole was great. - The Yukon mashed potatoes were very smooth and rich. - For dessert, we got the grandma's chocolate cake, which was recommended by our waiter.  It was obviously sitting in the freezer for a while, but it was delicious! - We also ordered the espresso martini with our dessert...FREAKING AMAZING!  It was sweet, but strong and super delicious!!!",

Arugula salad Filet Mignon (Australian cut)  And if you have one other person that doesn't mind a wandering fork: Order your guest the mahi mahi pasta in pesto cream sauce, and down it all with one of their impressive wines.  I was so impressed with the hospitality, service and quality at this restaurant, it nearly made up for all of the subpar places we visited all around it.",

    "text": "I went here right as they were closing, which made the food come out extra quick, obviously cause the staff wanted to leave.  That was one of the few good things, and there aren't too many compared to other fine dining in las vegas.  Anyway, the decor is pretty cool. Reminds me of an old country club style or maybe even a law office with dark wood and comfortable booths. also a plus.  The wine and cocktail lists were good. They had a wide variety of stuff, this is standard in Vegas though.  I had the halibut for an entree and I must admit it was pretty good! The reason why this only gets three stars is because of the appetizers. The chili was bland, I like staggs better and it's much cheaper. The shrimp cocktail was...small, expensive and are probably the same shrimp you can get at the all you can eat buffet.   Overall, food was average, everything else was great. There's so many good places in Las Vegas, it's hard to give this anything more than 3 stars.",

Went to LV for a long weekend and we decided on Tender for dinner our first night.  The menu has so many delicious items to choose from, and, they start you off with delicious bread and pesto dipping oil.  Our server, (Dewey I believe) was amazing, he was attentive, informative and friendly.  The menu is al a carte, but, the portion of the sides are enough to split.  (we had a group of 4 and I would say each side is enough for 4).  The bar made yummy drinks and the time between sitting down, ordering and receiving food, was just enough to make it a comfortable experience.  The restaurant offers little tables for your purse to keep it off the floor which, was nice.  The decor would be considered a bit dated if it were a standalone restaurant in BOS but, for Vegas, it was great.  There is a woman that walks around to take \"prom\" style photos of your table (I find this is a staple at most of the restaurants I have been at in LV), we had fun with it.",

Why doesn't it say gelato? He didn't have much of a response. But after trying it I'm sure where from. Anyways if you can't tell already, the service was horrible.  The  server, Alan, was preticerly rude and very short and unknowledgeable about the products at the restaurant he worked...or he just didn't care to give us the extra time. Either way the food definitely did nothing to commend the service. Lobster in the bisque was chewy...gross, I didn't even take more than 3 bites. Steak was over done and under seasoned. Creme brulee is hard to mess up and was the best flavor of the meal. I don't recommend wasting your money here. There are so many places in Vegas... Go somewhere they appreciate their guest. I'd recommend Delmonico's or the Steakhouse in circus circus.   Goes without saying but I will anyways, we will not be revisiting this restaurant. This was our first and last meal here.",

My expectations weren't high as I haven't heard anyone really talk about Tender before. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice my dinner was!  We had two male servers who assisted us for dinner which was different for a steakhouse. Both were kind and professional and made a point to check up on our table throughout the evening.   We got a half dozen oysters and a salmon platter to start. I really enjoyed the salmon platter which came in three small presentations: salmon poke, seared salmon, and smoked salmon. For steak I got the dry aged rib eye and was pretty impressed! It lived up to the name of the steakhouse; very tender and juicy. There wasn't too much fat which I liked. For sides, we ordered the asparagus for some greens and the lobster risotto. Asparagus wasn't anything special and the risotto was very rich and creamy.   I would choose Mastro's or Craftsteak over Tender but I still really enjoyed my experience here. I think that some may underestimate how good Tender actually is!",

The back room is similar to old style steak houses in New York with great personal service from experienced waiters.   Menu items; The Ribeye trio which is 3 different cuts of meat including bison is a wonderful selection. All steaks were tender and flavorful. Side note: Don't come to fine steak restaurants and order steaks medium or well done. A great juicy steak is prepared rare to medium rare.   The Tomahawk steak looks like something the Flintstones would eat. Both of these cuts of meat can be split among two people.  The fish choices were somewhat unspectacular however if you are going to a premium steak house, you should be prepared for the turf and not the surf. The grilled asparagus, mash potatoes, cream corn are all extra ($10 ea)   Deserts: the banana foster was recommended and for a good reason, the rum sauce was simply great. Overall a great dining experience.",

The Menu was not huge but the Server was very knowledgeble about the cuts of meats and best sides to have with what.  I ordered a Lamb Shank and a side of Yukon Gold Mash, and the wee Cuz ordered a trio of Fillet with a Kobi,Bison and Venison and a side of Bone Marrow.  My Lamb came with Lentils and Vegatables although I very much enjoyed having the Potatoes they were not really necessary, the lamb was very tender and tasty. The wee Cuz loved all of her cuts of meat they were cooked just as she wanted and she loved the Bone Marrow.  We had a glass of house wine with dinner I had a very nice Merlot and the wee Yin er usual Rose with Soda and Ice.  We were not thinking of Pudding as we were both happily full, but the attaentive server had heard Pauline say it was her Birthday and brought her a trio of Desserts with Happy Birthday pipied onto the plate a very nice gesture.  Ther was a delicious Creme Caramel with a shortbread biscuit topper, Chocolate cake and a Caramel Cheese Cake, Mmmmm I am not a big pudding eater but the Creme Caramel was delicious. After Dinner we retired to the Bar and had our complimentry Cocktail I had a very nice Cosmopolit and and wee Cuz had a Mojito.  All in all a very nice dining experience so much we returned on the Saturday to repeat the experience.",

The food was pretty good.  I ordered the sea bass, my husband had the rib eye.  Then we ordered 3 sides (I think the deal was 3 sides for $20).  Oddly enough, our favorite item.  The creamed corn.  Amazing!  Also ordered mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms.  If you aren't into truly exotic mushrooms, I wouldn't recommend.  They tasted great, but there were two types of mushrooms in the blend that we so hard and mealy they were basically inedible.  The meat and fish were good, not the best we've ever had, but pretty good. We'll be back next time we're in town, just hoping waiter #1 won't be there! ;)",

    "text": "Review #500  Allow me to preface this review by thanking Yelp for providing me the opportunity to become part of such a friendly and positive social community.  I am thankful, as well as grateful, for all the acquaintances and friendships that I have nurtured and developed over the past five years.  Since becoming a more active member last year, I have attended numerous enjoyable and lively events, met many fun and humorous people, gained knowledge on the art of photobombing, co-hosted three UYEs, and established new friendships.    Though this review is about a restaurant, it's significant since my meal at Tender was with two wonderful friends I met thru Yelp.  At the same time, my main purpose of traveling to Las Vegas was to meet and reunite with old/dear friends.    And so, I dedicate my 500th review to Yelp, good friends, good food, and good times.  Now, on to the review:  a TENDER moment.  Truly some of the best food and service I have experienced has been in the gambling capital of America, Las Vegas.  Many thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U., for introducing me to his \"kitchen\" while vacationing in Las Vegas recently.  Located on the casino level of the Luxor, the bar area is inviting while opening up to the remainder of the spacious restaurant.  Though Tender doesn't look very grand or large from the outside, surprisingly the restaurant stretches farther within (as I soon found out after a visit to the restroom).  Since Rod had dined here numerous times (and actually regained his Dukedom during the trip), I allowed him to take the lead on where to sit and what to order.  Rod's area of choice:  the bar, of course.  Now, for those of you who are not fond of bar seating, I implore you to rethink your decision.  Bar seating is quite enjoyable and entertaining to say the least.  It was clearly no surprise that Rod knew practically all of the bartenders working on both of our visits.  Mike and Robin stand out, particularly, in my memory for their outgoing and social personalities.    FOOD:  *Tomato salad (shared):  A special consisting of various types of tomatoes from the Napa Valley served with mozzarella cheese and spattered with olive oil.  It was exquisite.  The perfect start to our meal.  Recommended if available.  *Chilled salmon tasting:  Three types were served including house cured gravlax, hot apple-wood smoked Skuna Bay salmon, and cold smoked Atlantic salmon.  Absolutely delicious.  I'd order this appetizer again for sure.  *Lamb Tasting:  This dish included lamb rack chop and lamb loin porterhouse.  Served with couscous and rosemary garlic lamb sauce.  Having only tried lamb once before, I decided to be adventurous.  The lamb was prepared well, and I enjoyed this dish immensely.   Cuts and portion size were just right.  The second dinner/visit with Rod and Terry K proved to be more enjoyable, humorous and full of laughter.  It seems its always a party with these two whether in Hawaii or on the mainland.  Of course, we all sat at the bar where we could engage in good conversation with the staff and amongst ourselves.  Plus, another round of drinks is quicker to order at the bar (*wink).  FOOD:  *Escargot (shared):  A nice start to the meal.  Small portions shared between the three of us.    *Bone Marrow:  Generous portion that looks intimidating, until you realize the actual portion must be separated from the bones themselves.  Very delectable.  For those that have yet to try bone marrow, take a chance and do try it at least once.    *Pork Chop:  I was shocked when the dish was finally set before me.  The portion is a behemoth certainly.  My fear was I wouldn't be able to make a dent after all the appetizers we ordered.  The meat was tender and preparation just perfect.    DRINK:    Martinis and wine were the beverages of choice for dinner.  An extensive wine list is available.  DESSERT:  *Espresso martini:  The perfect end to a delicious meal.   That is all.  SERVICE:  Friendly, accommodating, meticulous, with superb attention to detail.  And I'm not just talking about the bartenders.  All staff we encountered exhibited such exceptional customer service.  Waters were readily refilled, rounds of drinks were quickly provided when requested, plates were cleared away and silverware replaced in a timely manner.  Appetizers and entrees were also delivered within a reasonable amount of time from when orders were placed.  There were some great conversations had with the bartenders especially, as they asked about where we were going and what we planned to do while in Vegas.  All the while they were also seeing to other patrons and filling drink orders for the restaurant.  Just an outstanding showing of camaraderie, teamwork, and exceptional service overall.  A job well done.  BOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and delicious meal shared with two wonderful friends, whom I never would have met were it not for Yelp.  Cheers to good friends and good food!!",

    "text": "Dinner was on an early Friday evening at 730.  We arrived right around that time and were seated immediately.  The hostess was polite and courteous.  Soon after, our servers Manuel and Tham introduced themselves.  Water and bread with the pesto Parmesan cheese in olive oil was delicious.  The menu has more than enough items to satisfy a steak and seafood eater.  Anyhow, we had the heirloom tomatoes with the side of bacon-the tomatoes were fresh, light, and surprisingly tasty.  The bacon added a savory element to the lightness of the tomatoes.  Our entrees consisted of the 8oz filet and the sea bass.  Sides were potatoes au gratin and asparagus.  We did actually have enough room left over for dessert and we had the bananas foster bread pudding; it was very good.  In summary, I really enjoyed dinner at Tender.  The wait staff was attentive without being annoying.  The atmosphere is typical of the old style steak house; dimly light with darker tones.  I do like that there was no obnoxiously loud music playing in the background... my pet peeve is having to yell to hear one another.  The food portions were perfect for me.  That being said, they will probably too small for you lol... The prices to me were reasonable for what you get.  We did have the MyVegas comp, and I think that made this meal even more enjoyable.  I've paid more for less at other high profile celebrity chef restaurants and I've paid less for comparable quality of food and service at other steak houses.  This is Vegas and it is what it is.  All in all this was a positive experience and one that ensures that the gf and I will be returning to Tender when we can.",

The sauces that come with really complemented the oysters!  Delicious! For my meal I had the Maine sea scallops.  It was 3 jumbo scallops with duck bacon on roasted bell pepper and edamame quinoa salad with avocado lobster blue crab puree.  It was AMAZING!  For dessert I had some type of blonde brownie that came in a skillet  and it was yummy as well.  My server was super nice and very social.  I am really glad I came here!",

Ordered the Ribeye trio: you get 3 small cuts (4-6 oz) of Australian wagyu, New Zealand, and bison. All three were distinctively different. Wagyu was best as expected: flavorful, buttery, and succulent. New Zealand was second, and Bison third (gamey taste).  Wife ordered top sirloin which she enjoyed.

    "text": "This review is for their Fall Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2014 menu.   Yelp Confession #265: I've never had an actual sit-down meal at a steakhouse, but Restaurant Week changed all that and Tender introduced me to the world of steakhouse dining. With that being said, bear with my newbie-ness to steakhouses.   Appetizer - Maine Lobster Bisque: A thick and creamy soup with several pieces of soft lobster meat. A good starter soup to warm you up for the next course.   Entree - Organic Free-Range Jidori Half Chicken: Sooo, I didn't order steak. Yeah, yeah, I know that I should've, but I ate steak the the day before and wasn't expecting to dine here the following evening. But hey, wouldn't you expect their other carnivorous offerings to be exceptional? The chicken breast and leg were perfectly cooked; no dryness at all. What I didn't like was the filmy chicken skin. I just can't stomach the idea of eating thin, fatty skin....of course, unless the skin was battered and fried or roasted -- hey, it's a preference.  Entree - Certified Angus Beef 10oz Rib-eye Steak: Tender, just like the name of the steakhouse it was prepared in. Soft to bite into, and juicy, no gnawing required. On the other hand, my boyfriend, who ordered the steak, didn't like its smokey flavor. Maybe my taste buds were out-of-whack that evening, but I wasn't able to detect any smokiness. Perhaps this might not be the best entree to order if you like your steak prepared as is, or with minimal seasoning.   Dessert Tasting Trio: The desserts were chocolate souffle, New York-style cheesecake, and creme brulee. All the desserts were delightful in their own way, but my favorites were the cheesecake and creme brulee.   Foie Gras - I couldn't resist ordering a side of foie gras, which was served on a small bed of fried rice -- yes, fried rice, and being Asian I squealed with excitement in my mind. On top of the seared foie gras was a heaping spoonful of blueberry compote. The combination of fried rice, foie gras, and blueberries was divine; I loved every. single. bite! Plus, you can't beat the portion size and the $19 cost. Other restaurants would easily charge 26 bucks for all that.  Service - Fine.   Other - The complimentary slices of bread were cold. Really?! Come on, Tender! Even the Grand Lux way down the street serves warm bread.    Overall - Not bad for my first steakhouse dining experience. Obvious tip: Stick with ordering the steak, or something other than the jidori chicken. Bon Appetit!",

I was a bit nervous because the reviews were mixed but decided to at least make a reservation and if something else came up then we could always cancel. I am so glad I didn't as this was one of the best places I have ever eaten!   My party of five arrived a few minutes late because we had trouble getting a cab from our hotel to the Luxor. It was not a problem and we were seated immediately. Our waiters were attentive and gave us suggestions on the menu. They assisted my table with cocktail and wine choices and were able to answer all our questions on the menu honestly, which I appreciate.   I ordered the tomahawk steak to split with my husband and our other guests ordered the porterhouse and New York strip. Every steak was cooked to perfection. All of us ordered different \"sauces\" to try with the steaks and although they tasted delicious, I don't even know why they are offered as every steak was insanely tender and amazing. Our tomahawk steak was probably the best thing I have ever eaten, the fat melted like butter and I hardly needed my knife at all to cut it. My table ordered the asparagus, gratin potatoes and mushrooms for sides and they were equally flavorful and a great suggestion from our waiters.   I made a comment that we were celebrating my husbands birthday, and to our surprise, the waiters remembered and brought my husband a cake with a candle Very sweet and I didn't even know they heard me talking to my table.   Overall I would highly recommend Tender and I am honestly very surprised that this steak house has received any review that is other than stellar. I dont see it...it's nothing other than amazing, delicious steaks!",

    "text": "Back to Tender for Restaurant Week, and another fine meal.    Excellent fresh Multigrain Bread with rich butter and good Sourdough dipped in fresh Pesto were nice complimentary openers.  Maine Lobster Bisque with Creamed Fresh Roasted Maine Lobster was silky smooth, with just a hint of a Sherry-like accent.  And a 10 oz. Certified Double R Ranch Angus Beef Ribeye Steak with Bell Pepper Sauce was perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The sauce,  a type I had never experienced before, tasted remarkably like Green Bell Pepper, and was very pleasant and complemented the beef quite well.  I just wished I had more of it to ladle over the melt-in-the-mouth meat.  But the Bearnaise Sauce ordered by Diane was so good it was drinkable, so my steak was not  suffering from any lack of sauce.  Baked Potato Wedges were soft but surprisingly tasty --like giant, full-figured French Fries.  After a long break between the completion of our entrees and service of dessert, the final course, a Dessert Tasting Trio of Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee, Chocolate Souffle Cake, and New York Style Cheesecake, included a rather bitter Chocolate Souffle with Mango Pearls and Mango, but excellent Cheesecake and a very fine Creme Brulee.  Two waiters served us very proficiently throughout our dinner.  Our water glasses were regularly refilled, and the restaurant manager even paid us a call to see that our party of four was being taken care of properly.  We were made to feel welcome, and each of us enjoyed a very satisfying dinner.    4-1/2 stars overall!",

The hostess was very sweet in greeting us and she was one of the highlights of the dinner, besides the wedge salad with bacon. The server was snooty and a bit awkward. The food is very overpriced for what you get. The sides are really only enough for one person, maybe 2 at the most if you aren't hungry- certainly not for table sharing.  The wedge salad with the bacon was delicious though- that was worth the $14 for sure.",

Dress code is not enforced, the people ahead of us looked like they just came from a 1980's Guns n Roses concert (no, the rock group was not in Vegas). We were seated quickly, the ambiance is nice and so was our waiter....who seemed to be working as a busser too. The wine list is meh, mainly a lot of cheap big name wines ie Kendal Jackson, Mondavi, etc. Nothing really unique. The bread (rolls) came out and I'm pretty sure they were bought at the local grocery aisle. Onto the main course, I got the ribeye and the wife got the filet with crab. Both were very good and cooked correctly. But overall, too many little things knocked this steakhouse restaurant down to 3 stars for me, I had/used a $75 comp from the MyVegas app and that was probably the only reason we had eaten here. Otherwise, Tender is not any cheaper than other Las Vegas steak houses but it lacks the \"wow factor\" of a high end steak house.",

It was just our luck we were sat down in one of his tables. He was super busy but he was by far one of the best waiters we have ever had. Even though he was busy, he didn't lack service at all.  His knowledge of the menu and his recommendations were perfect. The manager even came out and asked how things were going which shows how important the customer is. We both had the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and asparagus on the side. The meat was cooked to perfection per how we asked. When Dewey had time he stopped and chatted with us which showed he also a very personable person which I think is very important to the experience and how important the customer feels to the restaurant. To sum it up, staff was great, food was great and the ambiance was romantic if that's what you're going for. Bad reviews are from grumpy, entitled people with expectations that aren't achievable. Haha! Go there. It's worth it and I hope you get Dewey as a server. He's the best!!!!",

Whenever I have steak I always like to bring my own bottle of wine, when I made the reservation I asked what the corkage fee would be and was perfectly fine paying it. When we are sat the first thing the waiter says is \"you know you're going to pay for me to open that right?!\" ...um what the heck???????? Obviously! A nice steak house with that kind of service? Give me a break! I felt very offended at his condescending demeanor and disrespect! Our server knew nothing about steaks or fine service for that matter! He could see I was annoyed and essentially said the bare minimum to me the rest of the evening.   His original comment totally set the stage for the actual dinner, our cuts of meat where all ok, perhaps I was just annoyed from my greeting that everything just seemed blah. My wife's filet mignon was overcooked, my ribeye was actually very tasty but not the best I've had.   The highlight of our evening was the dessert. Wow! Banana foster plus bread pudding and banana rum sauce made and absolutely amazing delicious banana bread pudding experience! Absolutely the best.   When you visit a steak house or any type of better dining establishment you expect a certain level of service to complement your experience, unfortunately this restaurant completely failed.",

As in most fine dining establishments, everything was ala carte, but I find it a little hard to pay $9 for a bowl of so-so mashed potatoes. I decided on the fresh fish sampler ($44) and it consisted of three pieces of fish 2\" x 2\" squares on a variety of lentils and other legumes and all three pieces were salty.  The fourth item was a prawn on some other spoonful of lentils?  The prawn was good, but I would have preferred sauteed spinach or creamed corn or mashed potatoes as the base instead of what was used in this dish.",

The decor is typical of a steakhouse.   To start I had one of the special a caprese salad, with heirloom tomatoes it was delicious. Absolutely perfect tomatoes and the cheese was perfectly seasoned. Loved it. My mom had a Caesar salad, she also enjoyed it. For dinner I had the small filet, it was good, I've had better, but nothing to really complain about, cooked to my liking of medium rare. The lyonnaise potatoes were ok, the wild mushrooms were delicious! We both loved those! My mom had a lobster tail, which they gladly removed from the shell for her. She said it was a little bit bland though.   We had a MyVegas comp, so $150 certificate. Our meal came to $149 before tax. So really not bad price wise. I would have paid full price for my meal no problem. In comparison, we did go to Stripsteak at Mandalay the next night, our prix fix meal was more than this... a full meal off the menu at Stripsteak would of probably been close to $300 so it was a great value at Tender!  Overall a great meal, great ambiance, great service. We had 2 or 3 servers waiting on us, all very attentive. I would suggest sitting in the back room, we sat there it was nice, away from the casino. I would say if you are staying at Luxor or nearby it's a great steakhouse and worth the money. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though.",

Admittedly, I am always somewhat skeptical of places such as this because I have been disappointed before- NOT the case here.  First off the ambiance and staff are phenomenal, despite being connected to a casino. The waiting staff is well versed on all of their options as well as proper items to accompany with. I tried many things and not one was below par in the slightest, but the star of the show (surprisingly enough) was a burger...  Definitely not any normal burger though, I wont ruin any secrets but all of the ingredients of the \"surf, turf, and air\" burger are of the highest quality and it can be tasted. Without a doubt the best meal I have ever had anywhere.",

As a vegetarian I asked what the chef could prepare for me (I know it is a steakhouse, but most places are accommodating) They said they might be able to make a pasta dish, not really what I was looking for so I just ordered some sides.    One of the biggest complaints I have is with the waitstaff.  Overheard one complaining to another about a tip they just received.  Our waiter ended up overcharging us for what we ordered.   Probably will not eat here again, unless all I'm getting is the cheese plate.",

    "text": "This review focuses on 4 letters: K-O-B-E and can be summed up in 4 words - prices don't match quality. I guess that's what happens when you don't have time to go to Japan, Hong Kong, or Macau to have authentic KOBE beef. You think you can get by with American KOBE to satisfy your taste curiosity. But keep that box on your bucket list unchecked.   It was Thanksgiving weekend. We ordered the following dishes at Tender. Filet Mignon: wagyu Kobe-style beef, Dixon Ranch, North Dakota (boneless 8 oz) ($80) Filet Mignon: black angus Omaha beef  (boneless 12 oz) ($49) Top Sirloin: wagyu Kobe-style beef, Snake River Farms, Idaho  (10 oz) ($35) Grilled asparagus ($9)  Visuals and Tastes Sizes shouldn't matter in this case as long as good things come in small packages.   In retrospect, although we should have toned down our expectations, we couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed when the waiter showed us the portions. It's a piece of small steak, accompanied by a few drips of sauce and a tiny bit of onions. The dishes all look quite \"lonely\". By that, I don't mean exquisite like some French cuisine. I mean the chef who prepared our food probably didn't bother to showcase any traces of his vision of food arts.   The steak looked overcooked despite it was easy to cut through. It's tender enough and juicy on first bite. But the flavor was rather bland and uninspiring. I had better KOBE-style beef before and honestly think some sub-thirty-dollar steaks from certain steakhouse franchises can top this.   The overall quality of KOBE beef at Tender doesn't warrant their price tags.  Since I'm giving 3-stars, I should leave this review with something positive. The ambience. it is great for couples who enjoy dining under dim lights as part of their romantic getaway.",

Hmmm... 7pm dinner and your already out of something? I would have accepted that answer if they were slammed with patrons or if he had advised us prior to ordering. Waiter also cleared our wine glasses even though my husband had every intention of ordering a glass of wine with his meal. Food was ok, although we've had better for the price. Bread was served cold, would have been nice warm. Also would have liked to have salt and pepper, not displayed on the table and not offered to us freshly ground table side.

On my last night and after having seen an advertisement on tv in the morning, I decided to go see the musical \"Menopause\" at the Luxor and eat dinner at Tender, also in the Luxor.    After the show, I walked through the casino and found Tender.  With no reservation, I asked if I could dine at the bar and the hostess staff were very pleasant and seated me right away.  My bartender brought me an awesome glass of Cabernet,  and let me unwind while I perused the menu.  Very lovely choices of beef, and some unusual big game kind of entrees for the more daring palate - I saw several items that I'd like to try.  On that night, though I selected a wedge salad and a classic filet - It was perfection!  I would highly recommend this restaurant and plan on going again on my next LV visit!",

    "text": "At first, I was going to rate this place one star, but the decor really is something to admire. Rest assure, that's where the compliments end.  I came to the Luxor to see Criss Angel with my sister and our men. we had called to book tickets for dinner as well. Tender was recommended. They gave us a list of options for a meal with a few exquisite options and based on those choices we agreed to fine there.  Upon arrival we receive an entirely different menu than what was described to us. When we notified the manager, he explained that we were told the wrong menu, that the box office has an outdated list. (Not our problem, we booked this place based on THAT description) After our expressed disappointment that we would not be getting the Filet Mignon that we were promised, he told us he would talk to the chef an see if he can have that made for us. (I'm confused...why he would have to talk to the chef since that's something that's on their full length menu) He returned and told us that the chef was able and will make us what we asked for. (This whole ordeal took 30 minutes! Keep in mind we had a show to get to)  Once the meal arrived we noticed immediately how large our filet's were. Cutting into them, we were sure this was NOT anywhere near a Filet Mignon! I'm sure they dressed up a chuck steak and tried to pass it off for what we ordered. They took us as fools! This meal alone was $100 a head! And even without great expectations, they fell wayyyy too short.  Tired of complaining with the little time they had left us to race to our show we ate in peace, and by peace I mean the waiter was absent almost the entire time. My sister had to get up and chase him down at one point! And no...it was no where near busy.  At the end of the meal, the manager promised to comp one of the bottles of wine we ordered, and only reduced the price by 25%. This was incredibly bad service. And to treat us like that, was incredibly disrespectful. I wouldn't advice going to this place....not unless you want to feel drained and insulted.",

Bread came right away and they were on top of the water glasses.  Our server Alan was very good and checked on us enough and not too often to be annoying, he was a nice guy.  I had the Kansas City Strip steak, it was actually pretty good, we shared asparagus and french fries, not the best fries in the world, I have had better but they were okay.......     The steak was soft and pretty tasty, my husband had the porterhouse and that was good as well.   This was much better than Camelot at Excalibur...... don't waste your time going there, we went there for Mother's day and will not return to Camelot.  Mescalin salad was good, I requested cherry tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes which they did...... it was good.  They ask you if you want steak sauce but they don't tell you there is a fee which I found a bit amusing.  He named three or so, so I picked the Bearnaise and we were charged $3 for it. I don't really care but it would have been nice to know before hand.  OH, if you check in on 4 square, there is a special, buy one glass of one, get one free, so that is an added plus :)   We will probably go back here again.

My girlfriend and I had booked a table for NYE 2013/2014 and we had been looking forward to eating in Luxor as that was where we were staying. Unfortunately Tender is almost as bad as the hotel.  We had entrees, and before we were finished eating them, steaks came in. They realized that we were not finished eating and quickly took them back to the kitchen, hoping we had not noticed. As a result, the steaks were pretty cold when they came in 10 minutes later.  I had ordered a medium rare steak and it was a lot more rare than medium rare. The bearnaise sauce lacked taste, they must have forgotten to add tarragon.  They also managed to try to take my plate two times, before I was finished eating. I thought it was well know that unless you put the cutlery in the \"I'm finished eating here\"-position, it means that they're not supposed to touch it. Not at Tender. We pretty much only tipped because it was New Year's Eve, as they were terrible at their job.",

    "text": "Visited on May 30, 2016  In my many, many years of restaurant dining, this is only the second occasion in which I have not given any tip whatsoever, this time for two reasons:  1. From the moment my wife and I entered this restaurant at the Luxor Hotel this evening, the service was disappointing. I won't list all the shortcomings but suffice it to say that it was very unsatisfactory. And in my discussion with the manager after the meal, she agreed with me.  2. Viewing their menu and prices, prior to selecting this restaurant, is difficult. The restaurant does not have its own website. The easiest way to access their menu is through the Luxor Hotel website. But when you do find it, no prices are listed for any of their menu items. Hmmmm, why not? (I later found that I could find their menu prices through a Google search but the prices listed there are already out of date.)  \"Fine dining\" offerings at the Luxor are limited to only Tender Steak & Seafood. Given the shortcomings we experienced, this might explain why, on a holiday evening, the restaurant was almost empty of diners.   For my next steak dinner in Las Vegas I'll take my beautiful wife to Ruth's Chris Steak House at Harrah's. Yes, the prices will be about the same but the restaurant is more straightforward about listing them, the food quality will probably be slightly better, and there is little doubt that their service will be far superior.",

The rest of the meal was OK (but not as exceptional as the mashed potatoes). The oysters were scrawny and on the dry side.  The arugula in the salad was not de-stemmed which made it nearly impossible to eat. ......but the mashed potatoes....dreamy.....",

The decor was very manly man sort of like a cigar/oak room, which was awesome.  The steaks came out perfect!  Since we had the free $150 voucher, I indulged and ordered the seafood platter, which came with lobster. (I then got a stink eye from my wife because we went over the voucher...but hey at least I ate some lobster!).   We would definitely go back when visiting Vegas again.  Order the Porterhouse and Ribeye!",

Loved it. The plush booths, the dim lighting, the interior overall set the perfect mood. Service was spot on with presentation, attitude and timing. Bear and I split a big ribeye and some sides, everything was as delicious as I wanted it to be. Boggles my mind that TENDER exists in the same casino as Rice & Company. I guess these are two great polar comparisons in terms of what served food should be like. After the initial shock that this met my (normal) expectations, I found no other surprises here-- in a good way.",

    "text": "We visited Tender during CES in January. It wasn't our first choice, but we wanted to take a client out for steaks and we were able to get a reservation at the last minute. This should have been a sign that perhaps there was a reason this restaurant wasn't booked during the busiest week in Vegas. The reviews online were very mixed though so we crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, what we experienced was far from excellent. Calling it mediocre would be being generous.  The absolute best thing about the meal was the mushroom soup that I ordered. I read many reviews saying to try the soup and it did not disappoint. In hindsight, I should have just ordered 2 bowls of the soup and nothing else. Everything else was a disappointment.  I ordered something on the \"special menu\" with daily features. It was a filet mignon (Omaha) that said was served with lobster tail. I was expecting a delicious filet and a lobster tail with drawn butter. For $95, that is what one would expect. Instead, I was served a mediocre filet and my lobster tail was cut up and mixed with rubbery shrimp. This tasted horrible. No drawn butter. The shrimp weren't even deveined. Yuck. Major disappointment.  Service was lacking. I wasn't even given a steak knife and had to use a butter knife. My fork was dirty and when they brought me a replacement, it too had dried food on it. Not sure how the server didn't notice this before he sat it down on my napkin.  Overall, Tender was a total disappointment. The soup was amazing. Everything else sucked. You might as well go to Logan's or Outback Steakhouse -- and even there you'd probably get better service.  Sorry, Tender. I won't be back.",

We got sold on one of the specials which was a 37ounce steak which they suggested we could split...Well when it came it was about 10 ounces of steak and 27ounces of bone.  So bad that the bone was twice as long as the plate.  Not to mention that it was way more expensive...  Sorry guess Im not use to the old bait and switch at  a high end steak house...  Should have stuck with the regular menu.... Needless to say we left a little hungry and this should never happen at a SteakHouse...",

We started with a bottle of Casiller Del Diablo... a nice medium bodied Cabernet recommend by the manager as they were out of our first 2 choices, by the way which they were extremely apologetic about and offered several alternate suggestions at the same price range. Paired with the cheese tasting... 3 or 5 samples of artisan cheese with 6 baguettes, dates, jams, candied walnuts and a fresh honeycomb (would have made a nice dessert as well), it went very well. Our fav was the Purple Moon Cheddar soaked in wine and it was delicious. Other reviewers complained about the size of the cheese samples, but we thought they were the right size for a tasting. The bread basket was awesome with bread with feta and a pumpkin bread that were both wonderful and served with olive oil infused pesto.  We split a 24 ounce Porterhouse, which was seasoned and prepared perfectly with great flavor and had sides of braised brussel sprouts and fries with house made ketchup and mustard aoili, More then enough for two! We finished with a dessert for each and coffee and the bill came in at $150,",

My husband and I stayed in vegas for a few days and decided to save this place for last. our flight left at 10, so we came here around 5 to enjoy what we thought would be a great meal.  they open at 5 for dinner. we were seated promptly. our server (cant remember his name but he was cool) greated us, asked for water service, and cocktails. i ordered one of the house drinks and my husband ordered beer. we started with a cheese plate, the tuna three ways (tar tar, seared and sushi roll) while the tuna was very fresh, it was bland. not alot of flavor. the cheese was good, cant go wrong with cutting cheese.  next course were salads. my husband ordered the ceasar and i had the wedge. the ceasar was very fishy, and my salad was boring. no flavor at all. extremely dissapointing.  Now for the entrees. i ordered the small ribeye, medium rare plus, and my husband ordered the strip medium rare. we ordered the red wine sauce and the ghost pepper sauce on the side and a side of the potato au gratin. my steak was cold, my husbands was over cooked and the potatoes were gross. they made my husband a new steak, but at that point he was so turned off he just wanted to leave.  the manager came over to see what was up, and had no idea there was even an issue. pathetic. maybe because i work in the service industry, I'm aware of how situations should be handled. but this place was just bad.   def better places to check out in vegas if your going to spend $300+ on dinner.",

I realize there are many great options for steak and thought we'd give Tender a try.  We were certainly not disappointed.  We had the Mediterranean Vegetarian Mezza for an appetizer and it was delightful.  She opted for the Wild Arugula and Watercress salad and I chose the Garden Bay Greens.  Both were fresh and tasty.  For dinner, I chose the 20 oz. bone-in Rib Eye and she had the Northwest Salmon.  We shared a dish of the Yukon Gold potato puree Both dishes were prepared perfectly.  My steak did not have the \"char\" some of the great Midwest steakhouses have, but the rib eye was generous and lived up to it's namesake, \"tender\"!  For desert, it was recommended by our wait staff to try the Banana Foster's Bread Pudding and, again, a home run!  There is not a more delicious and decadent way to get your daily requirement of potassium!   And speaking of the wait staff, from the hostess to the waiter to the server, everyone was attentive, friendly and accommodating.  They even have a house photographer who can take a picture at your table for your special evening, if you so desire.  We couldn't have asked for a better end to our Las Vegas getaway!",

We started with the soup trio. It can out warm but not hot like I enjoy soup. I doubled the lobster bisque and had a mushroom soup. All was good but not super memorable. I had a flat iron steak @32$ that was very gristly and had to be sent back. This angered me to no end because I'm literally sawing into this supposed tender piece of meat like I have a hacksaw cutting metal. Saw saw grind grind. Literally can't cut it. The waiter (big guy with trouble tucking his shirt into his pants reminded me a bit do Dan Connor from Rosanne but not funny) makes a snide comment about it being a knife and a steak and you have to cut it. Really? Seriously? I'm 52. I've cut a few steaks in my life. Jeeesh. I finally had to ask for a manager by the assistant to our waiter. Manager came over and was very apologetic and took it away. Finally waiter came by and said \"looks like you got that one in a 100 bad ones huh?\" By the time the new steak came out our lobster risotto was now cold and still had some undercooked rice. Just an annoying crunch here and there. My husband had a bone in ribeye which he enjoyed and a baked potato that was fine. We started with a salad that had bacon. I can't remember the. Are but was very good and we split it. For dessert we had a trio. This was probably the thing most disappointing. We had asked our waiter what was good. He said well you don't get chocolate souffle at many places. Ya ok but is it GOOD?  Not really. It went in like this and finally got trio. Usually on a trio you get smaller sizes but still generous. This was ridiculous. One bite snacks. The only thing we could get more than a bite of was cream brulee. The cheesecake was tasteless.   Our server was lackluster heavy set man who did not seem at attentive. His assistant was better. The ambience was very nice dark woods and comfortable tables that are a fair space between each other. Food 21/2 stars. Ambience 5. Service 2. Of this hadn't been a 200$ plus tip meal,  things could have been forgiven easier but at that price point with no alcohol, it should have been STELLAR.",

    "text": "One has to wonder where people's head are at in their reviews.  I can only assume they cannot tell the difference between standard quality dishes and elite dishes.  I've eaten here many times and I tell everyone who visits Las Vegas that Tender is the 2nd best steakhouse in the city.  I understand people are skeptical because it is after all in the Luxor who have about the worse places to eat on MLife properties after Excalibur.  Do not let it being in the Luxor fool you.  I will start off with my waiter - the man, the myth, the DEWEY.    DEWEY knows the entire menu, wine list and can give you a history lesson on Tender menu history.  He is like Dean Martin in charge of the roast, he is in charge at all times and commands the floor of Tender like a Field Marshall in battle.  I've pretty much had everything on the menu which sadly has been cut in half within the past year (HINT TO MANAGER, bring back a few more dishes).  The best steakhouse in LV is Jean Georges at Aria.  Tender is better than Stripsteak, Gordon Ramsey, Prime, Gallaghers etc, all places I like and eat at regularly.  Salads at Tender are all quite good.  The sides are above average. They cook baked potatoes properly, their mushrooms are excellent, asparagus has a nice lemon twist to it and pretty much all sides are solid.  Steaks and game dishes are ELITE.  Tender has one of the best fillets in the USA.  The Center Cut is a touch better than the standard cut.  Their Porterhouse and Prime Rib are also 8 to 9 out of 10 in taste/quality. Strangely though their bone-in cowboy style Rib-Eye can be a slight miss once in awhile.  If you are eating there and want steak, start with the fillet and you will thank me.  Their desserts are all quite good.  Ambience is laid back, no high roller snobs here.   Manager here is also ace.  Cocktails are excellent to boot.  I will eat here again and again for a long time.",

Cutting edge, imaginative food?  Michelin quality service?  Magical ambiance?  Dare I say, as a foodie, they all contribute, but Michelin stars, James Beard awards, even yelp stars mean jack $hit.  Great dining experiences are based on the company one chooses to share the meal.  Everything else just plays a supporting role.  To some, it's the neighborhood deli down the street or the okazuya of their childhood.  To me, simply the place that I have celebrated more evenings with friends, old and new, forged more new relationships in a new city than anywhere else...  170 visits.  Solid food.  Outstanding service (especially at the bar).  Comfortable ambiance.   When a rare problem arises, it's corrected with no fuss or excess intrusion.   Nothing get's in the way of a great time.  New management is currently updating the menu and the wine list.  Many old time favorites are gone, replaced by simpler dishes and seasonal specials.  For starters, the seasonal heirloom tomato plate (over a dozen different types of tomatoes dressed in EVOO, topped with pink Himalayan sea salt and micro basil) is a must.  Colorful and playful for the palate.  The contrast in sweetness and acidity between the different types of tomatoes is very pronounced.  The exotic mushroom soup is also outstanding.  Mushroomy flavor in a broth seemingly including bone marrow in consistency and flavor.   Fresh oysters and a classic shrimp cocktail round also make for good eats.  This is a steakhouse and the beef shines.  The A5 Kobe is the real deal.  Ask for the certificate if you don't believe it.  Offered in both a filet and boneless rib eye, absolutely delicious and the lowest price anywhere on the Strip.   Very tender, sweet, with a clean beef flavor.  Very buttery.  Order it simply seared (below rare) for the best experience.   A good selection of cuts from different producers including an outstanding bison rib eye.  All are perfectly seared, cooked to temperature, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  Other standout mains include the always delicious wild game trio (venison osso bucco, elk medallions, and wild boar rack chop) and the full size, perfectly braised and sauced venison osso bucco.    Solid sides including a very fairly priced bone marrow ($6).  Great albeit huge desserts, try the souffles.  Very good selection of wines by the glass; massive pours.  Well chosen wine list with reasonable Vegas resort pricing.  Experiences ready for the making.  Bravo.",

We were staying at the Luxor and decided to have a nice dinner and chose Tender since we walked right by it each time we went to our room.  We made reservations and were seated after about 10 minutes, we waited in the lounge area and met a nice older couple visiting from London.   Our server Chuck was fantastic! We started off with 1/2 oz Caviar ($35) - first time trying it for both of us, and it was rather tasty! My husband ordered the Beef Angust Flat Iron Steak($25) with a slow roasted russet potatoe($7) - i didn't sample anything of what he ate, but he couldn't say enough good things about his meal. I ordered the Omaha Beef Filet Mignon ($40) --and OMG!! was it to die for...it melted in my mouth, and i'm still having dreams about it.   All in all though I rated 5 stars, don't think i'd revisit simply because there are about 500 other restaurants i've yet to try in Las Vegas!",

On Saturday we walked the strip all day, completely forgetting that it was Saturday and we should probably make reservations for dinner at some point.  We got back to the room around 7, and the BF called the concierge (we were staying at Mandalay Bay) to look for reservations within the hour, since we were starving.  After trying several options, Tender had the earliest opening.  We were seated right away, in a round lovey-dovey booth, and ordered a bottle of Ruffino Chianti, one of my favorites.  For appetizers, we enjoyed half a dozen Virginia oysters and carpaccio.  Entrees were the hanging tender and bone-in ribeye, both medium rare, which we shared, and a side of the sweet potato puree, which we also shared.  Both steaks were delicious and perfectly cooked, it worked out well that I liked the ribeye better and he enjoyed the hanging tender better.  Either that, or he was just trying to make me happy.  I was.  The only thing that makes me sad is I didn't get around to eating my leftovers.  Service, decor, and food, all outstanding.  Tender is not one of the places I had heard of or remember seeing in my research before heading for Vegas, but definitely a hidden gem to check out!",

    "text": "We received a comp for Tender so we tried it last night. Apparently, we had two waiters but you wouldn't have ever known because the service was painfully slow. They weren't busy so there really wasn't any excuse for the inattentive service. Also, the two waiters didn't seem to be communicating so after one offered us dessert and we declined, the other came by 10 minutes later to offer the dessert menu. The biggest issue with this place is that it's not cheap yet it has the crowd of an Outback. If I'm paying $200+ for dinner and wine, I'd also appreciate they at least TRY to enforce a dress code. It definitely drags down the ambiance to watch the people who brought their 5 year old and allow him to run around the tables, seeing men in shorts and baseball hats, and women in clothes that look like they're typically used for yard work in the same restaurant. I dressed business casual and felt severely over-dressed.  Even the waiters though (who wear shirts and ties) have their shirts unbuttoned and their ties are sloppy.  The food was good however. I had the wild game and my boyfriend had the filet. The food was good... not great. Comps or not, I wouldn't ever return and I would not recommend it. If you do go, just know that you can wear sweatpants.  ;)",

Minus 1 star because the main course was just meh.  Leaving a total of...3 stars. Good thing I can do math.  I was roped into making a reservation here after the Criss Angel show when speaking with a hotel rep on the phone. She claimed it was only $30 per person per entree. What a lie.   I like how they have two servers who wait on you to maximize the quality of service. That was really impressive. We never had a lull in service the entire time we were there.  We started out with a complimentary amuse-bouche of kobe beef in sour cream and chives. Delicious. I was really excited about the rest of the food after that.  I ordered the pumpkin and fuji apple soup which was wonderful and the Scottish Salmon with pilaf and roasted red peppers. The portions here are pretty small...so I was comfortably full afterwards and not stuffed beyond belief. The pumpkin and fuji apple soup came with some kind of pumpkin spice bread and apple butter. The butter was incredible...it was sweet and dissolved in your mouth.   I was less impressed with the salmon. Granted, it's not salmon season and I should have thought about that...but I thought that because it was Scottish, maybe it would be better. It was just mediocre. Nothing I would ever order again.  The problem with this restaurant is that it was EXTREMELY hot. As in EXTREMELY hot. I was SO overheated that I couldn't enjoy my meal and almost had to leave. By dessert time, I ran out of there and hopped into the bar Minus 5 to cool off.   I would come back here, but I'd order steak, as it is a steakhouse. The bf ordered an awesome looking steak which was very tender and delicious. I'd definitely do that. But just be forewarned that after 2 appetizers and 2 entrees (on the lower side of pricing) it still came out to over $130. Bummer.",

I didn't like the mushroom soup at all. The steak at first was okay, but the after taste made me want to vomit. The service was so slow that we ended up leaving before we could get the dessert since we had a show to watch. We had come 2.5 hours early to eat before the show, but the service was so slow we just had to leave. Never again. I do not recommend.",

Also a plus that you can mix what kind of sauce and vegetables you want yourself. The downside was the price on the restaurant which was kinda expensive. Also we had to wait some time to get our food, but this was accepted since we were a party of 17!",

    "text": "I would avoid this one for food, service, and price.  We came here for their Thanksgiving prix fixe since we were in town that day. The experience started with a 10-minute wait to be seated in a mostly-empty restaurant (despite having a reservation), and then another 20 minutes before anyone even came by and asked about drinks. Then another 20 minutes before anyone brought the drinks and bread. About an hour after we arrived on time for our reservation, we finally ordered our food. The rest of the evening went comparably.  Nothing that we had was passable for a restaurant at this price point. The escargot appetizer was completely chewy. The soup was bland, literally a broth with some apple flakes. The white meat was dry and the dark meat was full of veins and cartilage. Etc etc. I understand that this is primarily a steak house, but I would a expect a restaurant charging these kinds of prices to be at least somewhat competent with a range of basic cooking techniques.  The only positive thing I can say about the place is that the drinks were decent, but they weren't spectacular. I was frankly expecting more for $15.",

Ordered the cheese board ($35). Had 6 slices of cheese. 7 pieces of sliced meats (venison, smoked something and rabbit??) Awful. We used to come to this restaurant just for the board, now we will never return because of it. Ordered shrimp cocktail ($20) 4 shrimp...smh. Finally we ordered three side dishes. Creamed spinach (Mom said it had soured), Augratin potatoes (they we served in a skillet, guy says careful they are hot...they were warm at best. The dollop of sour cream they placed on top stayed the entire time. If sour cream isn't melting, something isn't remotely hot.) and finally the mushrooms. Out of everything we ordered the side dish of mushrooms was the best part. The service sucked royally. They didn't ask us once how we were doing.  I don't usually write about bad experiences, but I figured with Las Vegas being a vast place with 1000s of places to eat. Be warned about dining here. *Manager took off the side dishes, but by that point the entire experience was already ruined. He made no effort to make it right. We asked for the check with the table full of food and left. Tisk tisk.",

    "text": "We've been here before and the food has always been pretty good. This time  - not so much. We started with the soup trio and the foie gras. The soup was fine but the foie gras still had bits of membrane attached. It was also unevenly cooked to the point of being cold in places.   For mains my daughter had the game tasting and I ordered a medium rare filet. For sides she ordered the mushrooms and I ordered Brussels sprouts for us to share. And so the problems really began.   Each table has a team of 3 servers. Our main server, Joe, was great. The rest of his team was seriously lacking. To start with, no one cleared the plates from our appetizers. When the gentleman arrived with our mains he actually left them cooling on the stand and made us wait while he cleared plates. Might have been smarter to move the plates, give us our mainz and sides and then take the other plates as he left.  But that's not the worst of it. As he set our sides on the table I noted to my daughter the discrepancy between the menu description of roasted Brussels sprouts and the braised/stewed ones we were being served. The server became quite rude and condescending , literally telling me that I was wrong. He said they were roasted and it was only the addition of sauce that made it appear otherwise. I was appalled at the way he spoke to us.   Once he left and we started in on the meal I discovered that my filet was rare instead of medium rare. Not a huge issue as they were quick to bring another that was properly done.  Would I eat here again? Possibly. In multiple visits this is the only time we've had less than stellar service. It's also the first time they've undercooked a filet for me. Having read lots of reviews noting undercooked steaks as an issue, next time I'll order it a little more done.",

One of the few reasonable things was the lobster risotto which was only twenty bucks. But probably worth about half that. It wasn't what I expected from Its description was thinking it would be filled with lobster. It was ok though for what it was. basically cheesy rice with barely any lobster in it, just a few lobster pieces. Really more like lobster flavoring.   The drinks here were more expensive than the bar just a few feet across the casino so I say buy them there. The menu did sound delicious so if you win big I say check it out.

Fatty pieces of meat (not in a good way, I love Ribeye fat but I swear they cut off the fatty parts they could not sell as a full steak and put this on this taster) and I ordered it medium-rare, as suggested by the waiter (I usually get rare). This steak was so rare, it was not good. I can't believe a steak house could not get med-rare. I felt like walking back and giving them a lecture about the doneness of meat and how to tell by touch. I can cook and serve four people four different doneness of steak, so I don't know why Tender could not get these three fatty, full of gristle, cooked to medium-rare is beyond my understanding.   Why not one star? We have very good service and tipped accordingly.",

The steak was average as well as the service but with upscale steakhouse prices; a 36 ounce Tomahawk steak was $90 for 2. We finished our meal by 10:30 PM. Upon requesting dessert; the waiter advised us that none of the desserts were available as the kitchen closed.  We requested to speak to a manager. All of a sudden the dessert menu spontaneously arrived. The waiter advised us that he located the chef and he was still in house.  Hence he could make any dessert we wanted.  We then ordered the banana foster.   A few minutes later the manager arrived at our table and informed us that the only thing that was not available was the banana foster but we could order anything else on the menu.  At this point we were somewhat disappointed as it seemed that our waiter was more interested in leaving then taking care of us.  My vice would be to pass on this restaurant. We will not return.",

She told us she would have a manager stop by which never happened. All in all the worst restaurant experience we've had in Las Vegas.   I ended up emailing their customer service the next day and they apologized for the crappy service and emailed me a 25% discount code for our next visit. That was nice, but their website is so confusing that you can't find where to redeem it. Luxor Fail!",

Soups were ok-I would not order again, Mains were a Wagyu Ribeye and the lamb tasting. Steak was great) and totally ala carte ) lamb came with couscous and roasted pearl onions. Both mains were great. We ordered kale and lobster risotto as sides. I would split the lobster risotto as a first course next time.  We shared an Apple Donut for desert-it was yummy.  Tip- ask for one of the rear/side dining rooms as the first room gets noise from the casino.",

My steak came out exactly medium-rare, like I ordered. The mashed potatoes were top notch as well. The service wasn't anything special but definitely nothing to complain about. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because of the price to food quality ratio. The food was definitely good but the steak also cost $65, so I wouldn't say it exceeded the cost.",

    "text": "Yes, there is a great restaurant at Luxor, yes, the previously run down Luxor and I'm not drunk when writing this.  Thanks to my Yelp and poker buddy Rod U. for dinner and the great find.  First thing you have to try is the wild game tasting trio.  Yes, it's very polarizing as some may like it or some may not.  One thing for sure, that almost everyone will agree with is that it's unique.    Start off with the antelope Osso buco, very tender and fall off the bone, not gamey at all.  Next is the venison, can't really describe this, best effort: the texture of duck but with the taste of beef.  Finish off with wild boar loin, it's a better tasting pork with a wild game twist.  Started off with the escargot Rockefeller style, it's a different take on escargot.  Another worthy try.  Luxor has done an extremely good job with their remodel, the carpets are no longer filthy, old and dated furniture was replaced.  Personally, I've avoided the Luxor because it was getting run down.  I will pay more visits here for sure.",

    "text": "Romantic setting, exceptional steaks that are expertly prepared, and generally great service! You would never expect a steakhouse of this caliber to be hidden in the Luxor, but yet it is. It's worth the trek through the dated casino to experience a meal that will leave you yearning to return!  We've dined at Tender five or six times now. We found it due to the MyVegas rewards program and while we no longer use their rewards, we still stop at Tender each time we're in Vegas. It's that good.  Over the years, we've had the creamed exotic mushroom soup ($12) (delicious but very rich), Maine lobster bisque ($15) (also delicious but very rich), Charcuterie board ($16) (good with a variety of cured meats, cheeses and mustards, etc.), Yukon mashed potatoes ($9) (very good), fried potato wedges ($11) (a tad greasy), the filet tasting trio (1-New Zealand organic, grass fed; 2-Black Angus grain fed; 3-Wagyu), the Snake River Wagyu sirloin and also the Wagyu filet. We've tried a lot on their menu! But, now we always have the Wagyu filet. It is, hands down, the best steak either of us has eaten! Period. No debate. It's very reasonably priced at $115 for 8 ounces and it needs no garnish or sauce; it stands alone. It's so good, on our last trip, we ate at Tender two nights in a row and had the Wagyu filet both nights. Folks, this is the kind of steak that is so tender is almost loses its shape! It literally starts to spread on the plate since the marbling of the fat is like spider webbing. You can cut it with a fork and that's no joke. I can't stress enough that if you're a steak lover, you have to try this at least once. Although, consider yourself warned...you WILL be hooked! (Note: They have a Wagyu Ribeye, 10oz for $135)  As for the service at Tender, we've had Tom as our server for all but two of our visits. He's extremely knowledgeable, efficient and a super nice person. He's great with the wine pairings and always has a smile on his face. If I were rating Tender on the steak and Tom, it would be five stars! But since our service wasn't as good the two times we didn't have Tom and due to a mix-up with our reservation on one visit (and how that was handled), I have to give it four.  We will go back again...but we will make sure Tom is working that night.",

    "text": "Had to make a short notice trip to Vegas and found a good rate at the Luxor. This is not a review of the Luxor so off I go to Tenders with my $20 coupon.   I dined alone and went there about 5:30 for dinner. I started out as the only person in my section of the dining room but by the time I left the tables started to fill. I started with a tomato variety starter which was tasty and plated nice. I got 2 different kinds of bread, not warm BTW and ordered the lamb shank with 1.25lb lobster accompanyment. The lamb was served with some type bean sauce and a sausage link that was bone dry on the inside. The lamb meat was tender and was easy to pry from the bone. The lobster was served in it's shell prepared in a buttery cheese sauce I think. I tried to save room for desert but all I could muster was a coffee after dinner drink.  There is plenty of staff around. Maybe too many. I saw my waiter chatting with another employee while my order was on his tray.  I was expecting more noise and stink since it is located right off of the casino but the noise wasn't too bad and there was no casino smell.   Pleasant ambiance but is a little dark around the booths which may bother some people.   Being right off the casino floor the location is convenient but it is not a high end restaurant even though the prices are on the high side.   Overall, not a bad experience but northing special. Fits in with Luxor environment",

The entire staff was accommodating in providing quick, yet attentive, service.  We decided on a variety of appetizers: the pumpkin ravioli (awesome), tomato & buffalo mozzarella (fresh & light), the surf & turf sliders (delightfullly different) and split the Kobe chili (just the right flavor). Of course, pre-show cocktails were a must and love that our martinis were shaken at the table.  Nice touch!  The ambiance, service and quality of the appetizers has sold me to return to experience a full dining evening at Tender in the VERY near future!",

If I were  a local (or stayed in Vegas long enough) I'd imagine it'd be fun to try all of their selections. The cut I had was well marbled and prepared to the proper degree of rarity (or is it rareness?).   They have a good drink selection as well.

    "text": "Okay here we go, here we go! FANTASTIC!!!  When staying at Luxor Hotel in Vegas or even if you aren't staying at that hotel, but are visiting Vegas. This place is a must visit.   Our dinner choices were-  1) an ice cold, crisp, and delicious iceburg lettuce salad, with blue cheese crumbles, and dressing, and fresh fresh plump tomatoes. One of the best i've ever had, and I am a huge fan of these salads, so i've had many.  2) The main course ala carte was the Huge Australian Rock Lobster Tail-OMG!!!! Massive in size, perfectly cooked, wonderful tail.. They served it piping hot, still steaming as it arrived, with a draw of butter.   No crazy accompaniments or sauces. Just delicious firm,( never chewy), melt in your mouth lobstel that was approx 12-15 nice sized bites of this lovely sea creature. Very rich and satisfying. You and I both know how a tail will usually just be a tease, and give you like 4-5 decent sized bites. Well not this hummer. It was a mega bionic Lobster tail. I've had this type of lobster tail before, but this one put the others to shame. Both in it's preperation (perfect) and its largeness, and it's simplicity.  A must eat!  3) A wonderful buttermilk and truffle shaving- side of mashed potatoes. A large helping- it was more than enough for two of us. It could've actually served three people. Very rich, and satisfying with just the right muddling of flavors. Perfect with the lobster.  4) i would've liked to also try their mashed japanese eggplant and/or their grilled olive oil sea salt brushed asparagus, as they presented and smelled delicious at the table next to us, but we were getting a large enough infusion of both deliciousness and calories to overpower even the biggest foodie or Wisconsinite. (kidding)  5) I am a huge cheesecake fan and have enjoyed it at literally hundreds of places over my close to 50 years. HANDS DOWN! THE BEST EVER! DIDJA HEAR ME?! THE BEST EVER...and yes i've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for dinner. No comparison Let me tell you why. This cheesecake was listed as a New York Cheesecake. Now let me tell you about the ingredients. Picture it.... Combination of full fat cream cheese, and a mild light goat cheese combination (no not the pungent goat cheese). a light and mild happy well fed organic pampered goat giving it up for this heavenly concoction of dessert heaven.  So cream cheese and goat cheese, on an apple cinnamon graham cracker crust. (super dense and thick) perfect aftertaste of like a madagascar cinnamon. Fantastic. There's more. A warm caramel sauce on the side and drizzled over the slice and the plate, a small amout of crushed pecans, and  marzipan cream likely infused with a touch of citrus-.all on the side. which if you took a dab of the marzipan, the carame-l and the crushed nuts, and then a nice sized bite of the cheesecake along wtth a morsel of the curst  .  Explosion!!!! of the best sweet, and a miniscule amont of slavory flavorings in your mouth that will leave you sitting with a face where one might think you are having a stroke. Such HEAVEN! The flavors and texture combined were almost shameful, it was sooooo good!  My partner enjoyed a cheese plate for dessert (3 cheeses) a delicious pungent blue cheese, a camembert that was perfection, and a goat cheese that was slightly pungent but very creamy, and all were accompanied perfectly by crusted bread, figs, nuts, chutne,y and sea salt.  Very much a go for it after dinner bit of deliciousness easily could've served two!  RAPTURE! I could only take about 6 bites of the cheesecake,  before i was near coma. Could've served two people easily along with strong cup of espresso....  NOW--, we enjoyed a meal that could only be described as in my top 10 EVER! and i love my food, eat out often, in both moderately priced, to very famous and pricey venues. This kicked most of the places asses- and was of the same league as Michael Minna- and Fleur De Lys in San Francisco.,,,for maybe half the price.   My partner enjoyed two glasses of a dry oakey Chardonnay and we shared a liter of sparkling italian water...  Total damage was less than $180...not including the tip.   Would've easily been $300 in San Fransisco where we live. Very reasonably priced.   The service was excellent. The ambiance very nice. It was designed well and looked like it could've been an old established 5 star 80 year old steak and seafood house We enjoyed nice dim lighting, the best leather seating, flowers, etc.. There was never a moment when we felt rushed, or that we got too little, or too much service  . It was a well constructed meal that was choreographed perfectly from beginning to end. . You could NEVER go wrong. 5 star all the way. We can't speak to the rest of the menu, but it held about 6 cuts of steak, about 10 exotic side dishs ,a well appointed menu, with a nice selection of wine, a nice seafood section, and a nicely put together dessert menu.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",

The escargot comes in a set of four and a piece of pita bread on the side. The snails are cooked in a cream sauce and spinach. I thought this dish had a good flavor, but the escargot was definitely lacking in quantity...we found one, maybe two tiny bits in each bite. The soup was disappointing to say the least. I am usually a big fan of cream of mushroom soup but this one had a sour note to it that ruined the soup for me. The lobster bisque was also sour and had no lobster flavor at all. Out of the three soups, the one that was most edible was the kobe chili. Even then, it was so over-salted that I only ate three or four bites at most. The entire meal had me reaching for a beverage just to drown out the saltiness. I shared the porterhouse with my boyfriend, which was a good choice because that piece of meat was huge! It was actually cooked to perfection and was quite tasty. The foie gras that I ordered with the steak was a good companion, so I was satisfied with this portion of the meal. Regardless of the good steak, I won't be coming back.",

Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.  If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.   I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me. The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).  The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.  The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.  The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad. This was the first time in my life I had to refuse a glass of wine.",

    "text": "I took Chris L. here for his birthday in April.  Don't get me wrong with my three stars: the steak is good!  He had buffalo (I think) and I had the classic filet mignon, but I really felt like there was nothing special about the food or restaurant.  It had a nice ambiance, the services was good, and the sides were fine (we had potatoes and asparagus).  But nothing about this place popped.  If I'm going to pay an arm and a leg for a steak it better blow my mind.  I was impressed with the hand-made chocolates that they will box up for you to save for later, but that's not really a saving grace at a steak restaurant.  I don't know, Tender.  You're gonna have to do something a little more exciting for me to try you out again.",

We were seated and it took about 8 minutes before anyone came to the table.  Our waiter set the tone of the night when he crossed us.  We all ordered Soup, which was incredible.  I had the mushroom soup and was outstanding, my other friends ordered the lobster bisque and both were very good.  I ordered the Kobe Steak and was so very disappointed.  It was a thin slice of prime.  The menu said 10 oz but I would beg to differ.  It came out cold, I ordered Medium Rare.  It was tasteless for $75 it wasn't worth $10.  We had sides of truffle mac and cheese and lobster risotto.  Both sides were very good.  I would avoid this restaurant.  It is WAY over priced and the service is horrible. There are other outstanding Steak Restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "For Vegas, I would expect a little better.  I was in Vegas for a big fight weekend, staying at the Luxor. Our group debated back and forth between Tender at the Luxor and Strip Steakhouse at Mandalay. Out of convenience we chose Tender.  That was a mistake.   The staff was friendly, the decor was pleasant. And then it went slightly downhill.  The appetizers were just okay. The oysters were oysters and tasted fairly fresh. The salads were pretty unimaginative across the table. I ordered the standard Iceberg wedge and it was okay.  I ordered the beef strip steak. It was fatty and a little grisly. Another guy ordered the ribeye medium rare and it came as beat-red rare as I've seen. Not to mention the meat was not that TENDER. Two guys ordered the grass-fed bison steaks and those were pretty good. They had a nice grass-fed taste and were cooked proper. But they weren't brilliantly seared or overly juicy.  The sides were pretty mediocre as well. We had the mushrooms, the creamed spinach, and mac and cheese. Nothing out of the ordinary or memorable.  Overall, it wasn't the worst steakhouse experience by any stretch. It was \"just okay\". We left FULL but UNIMPRESSED.  And unfortunately, with all the amazing choices for steakhouses in Vegas, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SETTLE FOR \"JUST OKAY\"?",

    "text": "I'm not sure where to start.....  First off I love the Luxor and the vibe it gives off.   My fiance and I had reservations for us 2 plus another 2. 4 altogether on New Year's Eve around 8pm.   We walked given the convenience from Mandalay Bay. Right on time, there's a line at the hostess' desk and we get seated promptly. I thought okay it will be great since we were taken care of immediately.  We got seated at a big, and I mean huge round table for the 4 of us. I will admit it's better than being smushed in a booth or having no elbow room to eat so no complaints there.   Tick tock.. I kid you not we literally sat there for 20 minutes. Observing all other tables, NO menus, NO water or NO drink offers, NO waiter to approach us at all. We even tried politely waving down the busy servers running around and none gave us the time of day. Other tables probably got more attention than us. I'm not sure why. My thing is, I was also a hostess AND a waitress and if you are unable to attend to your newly sat table a minute or 2 within seating, have them wait until so. Not at the table to feel like they're being ignored. I was really frustrated but tried to not let it show since we were out with others  Okay, then our waiter arrives and he seemed exhausted. He asked for waters, sparkling, bottled, iced. That took another TEN minutes. Oh AND THEN he asked for drinks after waters. We all ordered different glasses of wine, which again took probably another 10 minutes. I'm starving. I'm frustrated. I just want to order and get to the new year (which isn't a way to \"enjoy\" dinner)  So let's get going on food: We had apps like the veggie/hummus dip platter (which was mediocre for a place like this I think) and mind you that our food took a very, VERY long time, even for an appetizer or BREAD with pesto oil.   They had a really good special for New Year's Eve, which we took advantage of. I believe it was a 36oz ribeye on the bone for an amazing price. So we did 2 orders or that which were a la carte. One piece medium rare, the other medium well.   We also added on another special they were offering - truffled mashed potatoes (the only really delicious thing here lol)   Creamed spinach - I wouldn't even bother  Asparagus - basic asparagus steamed with a spritz of lemon for flavor   So. Our food finally came out. After chowing down on bread and our basic app we just want real food.  My fiance and I shared the medium rare. I personally love meat on the more blue side but I could have sworn this was just RARE. It was beautiful on the outside but... it wasn't cooked medium rare AT ALL. You'd think a steakhouse would know what's up????   So... we go on and ask for horseradish both creamy and not and that took another 10 minutes to receive. The waiter also rolled his eye at my fiance when asking.   Dinner was so-so. I'm telling you the mashed potatoes were the only thing worth waiting for.   So another thing that ticked me off was that upon calling for the reservation, I mentioned it was my fiance a birthday. Which really, his birthday falls on New Year's Eve and I was expecting at least a decent experience. Jeez, I had to remind the waiter about his birthday and it was SO rudely taken upon that it wasn't a surprise anymore. Which in the back of my head I'm just annoyed because I KNOW I told the host who helped me on the phone that it was for a birthday celebration.   So blah blah they bring out this trio dessert that was okay. Creme brulee, brownie muffin thing, and another pastry. It was whatever. I just wanted to get out of there by now.   So we try to salvage the night and get out and the waiter mentions don't forget to give your Mlife card for points so we did. And only to find out 2 weeks later our points didn't even post on our account. REALLY?   We call customer service and they say we have to go out of OUR way to call Tender again, request them to email Mlife adjustments to do so accordingly. We have to keep going out of our way for an already cheaply experience? Dinner wasn't cheap and we didn't even get our points... when our waiter forsure took our mlife card and payment card. It's not worth the frustration, the rude service, the unawareness of tables. I think what also made me more mad was that I know EXACTLY what waiters are supposed to do and not do.  I wish the reviews reflected what this place truly is because... we had a terrible time and for a STEAKHOUSE the service was definitely not up to par. Not at all.   We come to Vegas probably every 3 months (often), and give different restaurants a try but this place isn't to do so.And I'll probably receive a response saying this was great feedback for future purposes and that they're deeply sorry for the inconvenience.... well, you know people pay for good food, service, and a good time and \"sorry\" doesn't really fix the terrible experiences people go through CONSISTENTLY it wastes their money. there's a serious issue with this joint that management needs to fix",

It's like eating dinner at the rogue, haberdashery facade in The Kingsmen.  The staff were incredible. The two waiters, who provided nonstop attention, interacted with us as if we'd known them for years, and by the end of our meal, we felt that we had. They were both the absolute best. The food was top notch, but sadly, we ate relatively little for such fine dining (still coming down from our BoB's pass). The complimentary pepper spread for the toast points was an outstanding amuse. We each had a soup; she, the mushroom, and I, the sumptuous, velvety lobster bisque. As I said, we ate very little. She finished with a salad, and I had the carpaccio which was exactly the uber-light main that I was hoping for that evening.  We'd definitely come back, and maybe try something wild... like actually getting a steak at a steakhouse.",

I ordered a bone in Ribeye rare and what I received was a 90% fat, very tough, over cooked cheep piece of meet. I've bought and cooked a grocery store bought Ribeye that's better than what the served. My wife ordered a Chicken and shrimp dish. The chicken was so dry, totally inedible, the shrimp was good. We could have had a better meal at Applebee's(and I hate Applebee's).

She had lots of suggestions on menu items as well as drink options. I decided on the crab cakes and my husband got a filet and a side of mashed potatoes. The food was good.

    "text": "First, let me start by saying that our bill for 2 without any alcohol or dessert was close to $190.  We have had better meals for $50 less at Ruth's Chris Steak House.  The bread served is nothing special.  Cool to room temperature, not much taste with chilled butter.  We order the $20 cheese plate.  Was ok, but uninspired.  We both ordered the bone-in ribeyes.  These were very good but at $54 a pop, you would expect them to be.  I ordered a baked potato and the wife order the lyonnaise potatoes.  We shared an order of carrots.  All the sides were very good.  Unfortunately since we were staying at the Luxor for another 4 nights and no microwaves in the room, the leftovers went to waste.  In all honesty the meal was comped by the hotel due to a security breach in our room by the maintenance staff along with the inconvenience of having to switch rooms.   The service was very good and they gave my wife a dessert for her birthday though surprised it was peanut butter.  However, for $190 there is no way I would recommend this for this kind of price.  Just not worth for slightly above average food and good service, even in Las Vegas.",

It had a lot of great things on it that I had never tried before.  For my entree I ordered the wild game tasting which consisted of an elk chop, bone in venison, and a wild boar chop.  Everything was delicious!  The venison had a similar texture to a pot roast and actually pulled apart with my fork!  Insanely tender!  I would love to go back here again!  I'd get the wild game tasting and probably the lamb tasting also!",

Not 5 stars because my steak wasn't medium throughout, and the truffle mac and cheese needed some salt. Also, at the end of the meal it took a long time for someone to check to see if I was ok and bring me my check. By that time I was so stuffed I just wanted to get out of there!   I had the lobster bisque which was superb, which is supposed to be broth but had a couple of pieces of lump located in it. Then I had the 14 oz NY strip and the truffle mac. The steak was amazing in the parts that were actually medium, and the truffle mac was good, but probably not worth the price on the menu. The waiter did offer to do another steak if I wasn't happy, but it wasn't that serious and I was hungry.   The wait staff was very nice and attentive, just took a little long to check in at the end. I'd give it another go if I came back. Lots of competition on the strip, but I can see how it's holding its own. While the meal was over $100, I won $65 at the slots immediately afterwards so there's that. Lol",

Holy shit. I couldn't remember what restaurant we were in, the wine, our meals, any appetizers, if we had desert...but this goddamn soup, I remembered.  This year, we wandered the Luxor and the Mandalay searching for the fabled magical soup we barely remembered sure that we ate in one of these restaurants. We asked the hostess about the soup, she confirmed and in we went.  The service was ok. The guy was good, but not great. For a waiter in a steakhouse, I wasn't impressed with his knowledge of beef. We weren't 100% about the soup, so we decided to order one, taste it and order another if it was it. When he brought the soup to the table, my girlfriend and I looked down at the plate and said, \"Yes. This is the mythical soup we remember.\" After one taste, we ordered the second bowl. Freaking unbelievable. Such good stuff.  I ordered the flatiron, J ordered the beef pot roast. Without hesitation, I can say that this was the best piece of meat I've ever had. The knife slid through the tender goodness without even applying pressure to the top. It was cooked perfectly. The pot roast was good, but not great. We actually chatted about how our crockpot pot roast was a little bit better than this.  The wine selection was good, the ambiance was great and the busser service was very nice.  The following day, we stopped back again for more soup and a few glasses of wine. That's how good this soup is.  We'll be back for another flatiron and another bowl next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I saw the mixed reviews but since I was staying at the Luxor, decided to give this place a try. It's a bad idea - don't do it.  First, we ordered an 8oz Filet medium and the sucker came out rare - not only that, but it wasn't even one 8oz piece, it was two smaller pieces set together closely to make it look like one. When I told the waiter, he offered no apologies but took it back to the kitchen on my dirty bread plate (which I am certain is a health code violation). Several minutes later, he dropped it back off onto the table and despite the outside looking black, the inside was still rare. Sent it back a second time, once again, no apology or assurance that this kind of thing never happens at a steakhouse that charges $44 for a single filet. When it came back to the table a third time, it was jerky - burnt to a crisp on the outside and well done on the inside.  Perhaps we need to send Chef a link to how to cook a steak! The meat itself was nothing special, it could have very well been picked up from Kroger.  We also got the scallop dish, which was perfection and the reason for the second star.  Another disappointing thing is my friend had inadvertently tipped over her wine glass and it fell into her quinoa and another waiter saw it happen and quickly came to clean up the spill and take the dish away. What is crazy is that nobody even offered to replace the half glass of wine she spilled. We are about to drop $150 for a meal that was poorly prepared and you can't even offer us that courtesy?   Management should be replaced, there is no excuse to have a staff that inept. I suspect this is why most of the tables sat unoccupied on a busy Saturday night.   Most of the positive reviews on Yelp are from years ago. This place is currently in the toilet. If you are in the mood for good steak, I'd suggest trying The Barrymore. It's far better and a bit less expensive.",

My partner and I shared the short rib ravioli, which was topped with some rich red sauce- delicious, not too much cheese, just right.  For entrees we went with the 12 oz filet and the 16 oz dry aged Kansas City strip.  Wow we're we sad when the last note was gone!  Rarely am I completely satisfied with how my steak comes out of the kitchen, but tender really hit the nail on the head!  When the check came, they were gracious and took my myvegas $75 off comp and explained the remainder of the bill & where I should sign.  If the manager was not so busy, I would have loved to stop him and tell him first hand what a beautiful job his staff did.  To conclude, thanks to Juan, Jesse, and the great minds in the kitchen, I will be recommending this place to my friends and am looking forward to coming back myself!",

We were told that there were two groups in front of us but that it would not be long.  About 10 minutes later we were taken back to our seat which was a large circular leather booth big enough to fit 6.  The decor ended up being lots of soothing earthy tones with the exception being the chandelier which was made to look like flames and I thought it looked cool.  After we were seated for about 5 minutes someone finally came over to talk with us, give us water and deliver the dip for our bread.  We were then left to stare at the dip for about 20 minutes before our bread came out.  In the meantime we ordered the Mediterranean appetizer, I went with the 10 oz flat iron (medium) while my fiance went with the big eye tuna and we decided to split the truffle macaroni as a side.  Once the bread finally came it tasted awesome with the olive oil dip that had basil and sea salt in it.  Whenever my steak came out it looked lonely on the gargantuan plate only garnished with a sprig of rosemary and 3 little pearl onions.  The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely leading to a great taste.  I also tried my fiances tuna and loved it with the only bad part about her plate being the sweet and spicy accompaniment being too spicy, this coming from a guy who owns scorpion and ghost chiles and loves spicy.  The truffle Mac and cheese came topped with some shaved black truffle on top.  It was amazing as the Mac and cheese was creamy and the truffle flavor was ever present.  While I loved it I do think that it overpowered the cheese and I was unable to tell the subtle flavored of it.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back her again in the future. All of my food was good and on food alone I would give it a 5 stars but the seeming lack of service at the beginning, especially for a pricier place, dropped it to 4 stars.",

I had the Omaha filet, creamed spinach, variety sauteed mushrooms and sea scallops all to share with my husband. The sea scallops were seared and some of the best I have ever had. For dessert, we shared fresh mango sorbet. delicious!  Two waiters assisted us through our meal and were very helpful and attentive.I would go back/ I also ordered a cocktail- Sidecar,  and it was made very well.",

We started with the kobe meatloaf sliders pretty yummy except for the seaweed spread didnt work at all with the sliders. Next I had the Hawaiian Blue Prawns with risotto it was OK nothing spectacular. The mashed potatoes were delicious but its really hard to go wrong there. My friend had the hawaiian blue tuna and she wasnt impressed at all and oh I almost forgot there was a gross odor at our table the whole time which the bday girl didnt appreciate. My friend had the spare ribs and he LOVED them. Oh and the Cooler was the best cocktail I had in Vegas. overall it was OK not sure if I'd go back for the 4 of us with 2 cocktails and a glass of wine it was $220.00.",

When we checked in we were surprised by the list of items they ran out of.  Cherry tomato's, a certain salad, some seafood dish.  Kinda odd, especially since it was not a special event weekend, or the end of a busy 1.  Portions of the food was good.  Meats were fresh, split our salad at not cost.  Some places don't do that, or don't like to.  This was a good steak dinner, just surprised by the missing food items, and people eating.  Maybe just an off night.  I will try some new places before I go back",

    "text": "I was almost outragged after my experience and then seeing my bill. I went in the beginning of Jan 2010. We were approached by the waiter (whom was from Albany, NY- being from the east I picked up on the accent). He might as well been from Jersey because he was very brash and not at all professional.  I started out ordering the tuna trio and my guest ordered one of the salads with a glass of sav. blanc and kahula and milk. The first coarses were okay- nothing to write home about, but by far the best part of our meal. We then ordered our 2nd coarses; I ordered the hanger steak cooked medium rare with a side of spinach and my guest ordered the fish trio (scallops, shrimp, and bass). My 2nd coarse had been prepared really rare, I mean almost blue (burnt on the outside, raw in the middle). The silver lining hadn't been taken off the steak so I choked with every bite. My guests scallops (her first time trying them) were grossly over cooked, little rubber bouncy balls would be a more accurate description and her entire dish was just unappealing. She finished eating her plate first and the busser removed the plate before I was done. The waiter came over and my guests plate was gone and he said, \"let me guess your steak was overcooked?\" Really???? She didn't even have the steak and when he took my dish away, which was barely touched he didn't even ask if it was okay. The bill was $190 for 2.   You can do so much better in Vegas. Don't waste your time on this outdated restaurant!",

Finished a shrimp, a scallop and half the salmon, and then as I bit into the other scallop, Rocks! Not One, not two but close to a dozen pieces. I could not eat any more. When the waiter came, I showed him the pieces of rock that I had taken out from my mouth and set aside. He came back with a plate, collected them and took them inside to show to the chef. He came back a few minutes later and said it was \"rice\". Said the scallops were placed next to rice, so some of ithe grains stuck to the scallops.   Now, I know rice. I can tell the difference between rice and rocks.  If there was a mistake on their part,  I would understand and even appreciate if they admit it. Blatant lying is another thing.   Not only someone here was trying to coverup a mistake, but on top of it, insulting my intelligence by lying about it. I would never go back. My advise:   There are plenty of choices nearby, so go elsewhere and have a pleasant evening. Don't bother going here.",

I will credit the attentive service, which met my expectations and the reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2. We had a quick dinner there. I ordered the hanger steak, my guest ordered the trio of seafood. My steak was well seasoned, but I can't say it was worth the $30+ bucks I paid for it. My guest really like the grilled prawns, which were ginormous. But the fish was not cooked through. It was chewy at the bottom, so obviously left unfinished. We ordered the potatoes gratin and creamed spinache. It was all just okay. I'd go back, but not before trying other steakhouses on the strip. Not a must-go place in Vegas.",

    "text": "My party of two had the: Hawaiian tuna appetizer trio Lobster Bisque Seafood Trio Entree Australian Filet Mignon Armed with the 20$ off 100$ coupon, my boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for our end of the year dinner. We are two students but we have eaten in many great restaurants around this price before. With the prices we were expecting something amazing. But what we got... did not come close. To summarize I think all the entrees should have been 10-15 dollars cheaper, and still that did not excuse the terribly cooked seafood and the general lack of seasoning. The sides that usually come with the entrees are nonexistant: if you were expecting your steak with a side of potatoes you are going to be disappointed. You will be just paying for a 39$ piece of steak with nothing near it and for it to only be 8 ounces. The Good: Service was great! Lobster Bisque was very good! The juicy pieces of lobster in it were delicious. The Bad: Hawaiian tuna appetizer: Consists of: A. the poki tuna salad: nothing amazing about the seasoning, pretty standard B. the weird ginger tuna thing: it is literally tuna dripped in honey and yuzu sauce, uninteresting to the palate C. sesame crusted tuna: once again not interesting, bland Seafood Trio Entree:  This was my entree. Consist of three shrimp: they were ridiculously salty. two scallop: you know that weird taste in scallops where it tastes like it just came out of the ocean and has that odd unpleasing flavor? this had it, I had to rescue it with lemon wedges. and sea bass: no flavor. did they just add salt and cook it or something? so bad, so not worth it.  The Australian Filet that was 39 dollars. Literally a piece of meat on a plate. Classy...not. once again as I watched my boyfriend get his single 39$ piece of underseasoned steak I could not help but think of how awesome the prix fixe menu at Ruth Chris Steakhouse (went to the Saint Louis location) was and how much better deal it was than this single underperforming piece of steak.  Who would give this five stars!!! seriously I don't understand those people. not worth it, even with the coupon. Please don't go here. There are better places to go in Vegas!! why spend 80 dollars (100$ plus tax and tip) for two people and eat terribly!!",

We ordered three New York Strip steaks and a tri tip for main coarse with salads to start.  Upon arrival of the salads we were given the wrong salads!! They apologized and went to fix.  One slip up lets be honest its not going to ruin the night.  HOWEVER when the our steaks came we ended up with ONE Ribeye, ONE New York, ONE Tri Tip and no fourth steak.  We waited for the waiter and they said they would make the steak and bring out (Gee Thanks).  To top it off it was my WIFE's Birthday Dinner and SHE did not get her meal. (Again great job!!)  We asked the manager and explained what happened and was told they would take the one steak off and that she TRY's to please everyone but sorry.  I would highly recommend  that if you want to go out for a nice dinner to AVOID THIS PLACE,  the female manager WILL NOT TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM even if you are a guest at the hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We also had tickets for the Chris Angel show which we made however missed the beginning of the show further ruined the night.  I gave it one star which was earned by the photographer other than that  there are many steak houses in Las Vegas HUGO's is outstanding, a local place MONTANA MEATS puts this place to shame plus the price is half.  HOPE THIS HELPS PREVENT ANOTHER VICTIM OF BAD SERVICE.  By the way the Chris Angel Show 5 stars a must see.",

    "text": "My experience mirrors that of Roy R.'s, leading me to think Tender has a beef (no pun intended) against people getting married.  I was part of a bachelorette party of 9 and we chose this place so that we could dress up and have a fancy meal.  It looked promising. Decor: dark lighting, dark wood everywhere, both of which are nice.  I felt like I was in the dining hall of someone's mansion.  We were seated in a semi-private room that had two long tables that could each hold 10 people.   Food: we were there on a Sunday and the majority of us chose the $39 prix-fixe menu which offered a good value: choice of soup or salad as a starter; choice of salmon, organic chicken or six ounce filet of beef as an entree; choice of cheesecake, creme brulee or flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  A glass of wine could be added for $15.  I had the salad which was quite tasty.  I had a sip of the mushroom soup--it was very mushroomy to the point of tasting almost like a seafood soup.  The beef filet was indeed very tender, but lacking in flavor.  I had to douse it in the peppercorn sauce that accompanied it.  The side order of mushrooms were delicious, as were the potato fingerlings.  The creme brulee was delicious.   Service: TERRIBLE.  Especially considering this place is supposed to be four or five star dining.  First, after we were seated, a server named Chuck came out and introduced himself as our server and asked us what we would like for drinks.  Then he went away.  Five minutes later, someone named Ezekiel (\"Easy\") came out and introduced himself as our server.  What happened to Chuck?  Usually servers announce a shift change; they did so earlier at the buffet we were at.  Then as Ezekiel was taking down our order, he made a tasteless joke towards the bride-to-be (will not elaborate).   When Ezekiel brought the drinks over, he brought two of us the wrong drinks and there was a few minutes of delay until the correct ones were brought out.   At one point after the entrees were served, I excused myself to the use the restroom and when I came back, 8 of the 9 dishes were cleared, including my 1/4 finished filet.  The servers were in the process of putting the unfinished side dishes into styrofoam leftover containers.  I asked if they had put my 4 ounces of steak in a doggie bag, and Ezekiel acted surprised.  \"Nobody told me you were not finished.\"  Um, Easy, it's YOUR job to ask if I was done with my meal and given how much was left, it should've been a no-brainer!  He kept saying he didn't know and that nobody told him.  I was about to throw a fit, but 1) this is supposed to be a happy occasion and 2) we were pressed for time.   When Ezekiel brought out the desserts, I got the cheesecake even though I ordered a creme brulee and had to wait a few minutes for the correct order.  Admittedly, the drink and dessert flubs are minor, but completely not expected at a 4 or 5 star dining establishment.   Taking away someone's unfinished entree is unacceptable at any establishment.  When that happened at California Pizza Kitchen, I got a voucher for a free appetizer for the next visit.  Here, he knew he messed up royally but did nothing to make amends.   I would wholeheartedly recommend against going to Tender.",

I've had better salmon for half the price!! My friend agreed also. I tried her filet and it was pretty dry. The heirloom tomato w/ mozzarella appetizer was great, if you love tomatoes. We wanted to make up for our just ok expensive meals so we treated ourselves to grandma's chocolate cake for dessert. It was absolutely delicious!! I would have been 100% content had I just had the dessert instead. Other than that, the service was pretty good.",

It's expensive here and it Vegas.  Be aware of hidden taxes and fees when you go to Vegas.  All in all pretty good.",

Both of which were not worth but 10 bucks - they had no flavor and were dry even though we had it cooked medium and medium rare. I've been to classy, expensive steak restaurants and have no problems putting down $200 for a meal if it is worth it. But this was terrible - almost ruined my night. the service was exceptional but the food was revolting. Will definitely never return and it makes me to sick to my stomach that this place got $200 from me.   STAY AWAY!",

    "text": "Argggggh, where do I start??  Well, I just got back from a buddy's bachelor party in Vegas and we (8 guys!) stayed at the Luxor for the long weekend.  I had actually made reservations at Nobu for this particular evening but we had a fair amount of luck at the tables so our wonderful pit boss dropped some show tickets on us...oooooof, Carrot Top???  Nevertheless, we figured good seats and a fair amount of scotch would make even Criss Angel bearable and at least Carrot Top is \"supposed\" to be funny.  So, canceled reservations at Nobu (1st mistake) so we could hit the show which wouldn't let out until about 10:30pm and left us with dining at the hotel if we still wanted something decent for our buddy's night...steaks sounded like a no-brainer (2nd mistake).  As expected, the show let out late and we had to book it to make it down to Tender where it seemed like we were one of the last tables to be sat.  Did I mention we were a group of 8 guys celebrating a bachelor party??  Oh, because I did when I made the reservation yet we were still sat at a round table that should have sat 6 girls, at most, at an organic salad bar.  I digress...  It's cool, we're gonna have some amazing service and delicious steaks...oh no you're not!  Our main server came out and did his thing where he tries to confuse you into buying the expensive water by giving  regular water a tricky name.  He then introduced us to some of the other grommets that would be helping him out.  Keep in mind that we had been drinking all day at the tables but had definitely sobered up at this point thanks to Carrot Top...so if you're picturing a boisterous crew, we were not they...yet.  A few of us ordered a beer because we knew that wine would be the night killer after a large meal.  After that, things went downhill as we barely ever saw the service again.  Beside the fact that we were seated so close together that we looked like we were in a rugby scrum, there was no sign of a bread basket or anyone to even request one from.  So, that left the few of us that didn't order apps and/or salads longingly watching the other dudes once those were delivered.    Once steaks were delivered, I was near boiling point but so hungry I didn't have the energy to complain.  Everyone at the table ordered a different cut of meat for the most part and I had the boneless strip...major potential.  HURT-ING.  Strip had no flavor whatsoever and I had to steal some of my buddy's horseradish just to put it down.  The sides we ordered (au gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and mac n cheese), which we were told would be more than enough, were more like the sample you get at Costco by the time they hit all 8 of us around the table.  Did I mention we were sitting at the same table that little kids get stuck at on Thanksgiving??  Bottom line was that the whole experience was horrible, service was weak, food was lacking, and we felt very rushed to get out of there since we were one of the last tables.  Whole tab was a bit over $600 and I didn't even stay long enough to see it come out.  Couple of guys stayed back, one of which is a very successful restaurateur, to complain to the manager and he acted like he could care less (3rd and final mistake, but not ours).  Called the hotel that next morning and complained about the abysmal experience at Tender and they asked us how they could make it right.  The answer from 8 guys???  BUFFET.  That was the best service, ambiance, and elbow room the whole weekend and the prime rib was exquisite...muah!    Don't waste your money at Tender folks.  I've already read a few reviews that sounded identical to our experience.  Criss Angel needs to make this place disappear.  BELIEVE that!",

Not having had time to read any reviews, I was skeptical and at first suggested we order only apps.  But the gentleman at the Luxor front desk was so convincing in his recommendation, and the staff was so nice when we walked in, that we decided to go for it.  We were pleasantly surprised!    We sat at the bar and ordered the bartender's recommendation:  13oz Bison steak and a wild game sampler (with antelope, wild boar and venison).  The day's special had a side of mushroom risotto that the bartender informed us was also available ala carte.  All were incredible!  Service was great... not impeccable... but great!  Again, super friendly, responsive and attentive.  We got out of there with two delicious meals, a half bottle of Chateauneuf-du-pape, and two shots of espresso for under $200.  Perfect in our book!  Side note:  Stop at Tenders. Do not proceed to Criss Angel.",

This is how it was described on the menu: seared diver-caught day-boat jumbo scallops, roasted corn quinoa & lobster, blue crab salad.  That is definitely not what I was served.  I received scallops on a bed of PLAIN quinoa that was the dryest, most tasteless quinoa I've ever had.  It was topped with the most tasteless guacamole that seemed to be prepared with edamame.  It was topped with very thin, overcooked, hard bacon bits that tasted like pieces of wood.  It also had some edamame tossed on top of it.  There was no crab salad, no lobster and no corn.  It was terrible.  The service was mediocre and the restaurant was expensive.  It was probably the biggest dining disappointment I've had in 5 years.  Truly sad that my fast food burger from In-N-Out was better than the meal I had here.",

Soups were salty.  Actually everything was a bit on the salty side.  Some of the meats were overlooked.  Tuna tartare was actually tuna sashimi.  I don't mind spending a chunk of money but I do expect something good.  Presentation was really good so it fooled you.",

My husband got the 2.25 pound lobster and we both thought it was the best lobster we have ever tasted.  We also shared a side of Au Gratin potatoes with cheddar.  I'm not usually a fan of these types of potatoes, but these were not too rich, it was delicious.  Everything from the service to the food was superb.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were in Las Vegas and we were staying the the Luxor Hotel. We were trying to think of a nice place to have dinner and were walking around our hotel before going up and getting dressed for a night out. We came across TENDER Steak & Seafood and figured, it's right in our hotel and the selection looked good. We went up to the room, changed our clothes, and came back down for dinner.  We started with the Trio of Soup which included tastings of the Lobster Bisque, Kobe Beef Chili, and Mushroom Soup. I ordered the Kobe Beef and Foie Gras Stroganoff and my boyfriend ordered the Bone-in Rib Eye with Mushrooms sauce. When the soups came out, OMG... these soups were amazing!! If we knew how good this was, we would've ordered two and stuck with one entree to share. My entree had a slice of kobe beef and foie gras meatloaf with slices of black truffles baked inside over pasta in a creamy stroganoff sauce with roasted whole vidallia onions. So rich and savory. My boyfriend's rib-eye was huge. The mushroom sauce that came with it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a side of Onions Rings to have with our meal, which was nothing too special. Heavily battered and a little soggy. =(  At the end of our meal, we ordered Creme Brulee for dessert. So yummy. Creamy custard, burnt sugar, caramelized bananas, and a shortbread cookie. It was so good that we almost ordered another one, but we were so full.  Ambience is dimly lit, but nice and quiet. Service was attentive. There was a photographer there that took people's pictures. Not sure what that was about, but my boyfriend ended up buying a set which costed us $80 on top of our bill. Two picture books of two 8 x 5 photos inside. They were nice, but I don't think it should've cost what we paid for. I guess that's what you should expect in Las Vegas. Never again...",

    "text": "In Vegas as a general rule I try to eat at the steakhouse located in the place I am staying in. I love a good steak dinner so this is not a hard one to follow. So with that being said I found myself here at Tender and here is my experience.   Service: I thought the service was good. My water was constantly refilled and my food was given to me promptly. I always had what I needed and when I asked for steak sauce they brought it to me quickly. Even though I was a party of one I still got treated well which has not always happened in fancier places like this.   Ambiance: The restaurant was dark and quiet and it was exactly what I like. I sat in a big booth and it was comfortable. I was nice to have a quiet dinner in peace.   Food: Ok now for the part that matter most right, the food. I ordered the 8 oz Black Angus Omaha Beef Filet Mignon and the Lobster Bisque. I like mine on the rare side. I noticed when I go to a steakhouse that specializes in steak I can order it medium rare and have it be the way I like it. Anywhere else I have to go rare. Here I ordered mine medium rare and it was perfect. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. I enjoyed eery bite. The Lobster Bisque was amazing too. It was hot and creamy and had plenty of lobster in it. I really enjoyed my dinner alot. I ordered steak and soup only for dinner so I could save room for a little dessert. For dessert I ordered a scoop of the blueberry patch icecream. They had a great dessert menu so believe me it was hard to choose. The icecream was great. A generous scoop of icecream with plenty of blueberries in it. The one thing about the food that I did not like was the bread. It was cold and hard and the olive oil and pesto they gave you to dip it in left something to be desired as well. That was the only bad thing.   Overall I really enjoyed the food and service here and next time I am at Luxor I will be back.",

I went cause my hotel gave me some dinner credit here, and I was craving scallops so I ordered scallops with quinoa along with a side of asparagus..The asparagus came out dry with too much blackened charring on the outside, to the point where they were wilting.  The scallops came out a bit cold, but I was too tired and hungry to ask them to be reheated.   It wasn't bad here, but I would say, seek out memorable meals that will knock your socks off.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to eat at TENDER steak and Seafood on a recent business trip to Las Vegas.  I love bison.  I cannot find it at too many places, but Tenders had it on the menu.  I ordered the Bison Ribeye.    As an appetizer they brought us a sampling of different breads and edible oils.  The Rye was way better than I was expecting, and the sourdough was great.  Then the Ribeye showed up.  I also ordered the green peppercorn sauce to add a little bit of kick to the Bison.  Normally I slather horseradish on my steaks, but they didn't have it as an option.  The bison ribeye was great.  My taste buds loved it.  So why did I rate the place as A-OK.  Quite simple - for $30 there should have been some veggies and mashed potatoes on my plate in addition to the single solitary piece of meat.  This would have been a 4-5 star rating if the meal included these two items in the meal.  For dessert I had the Banana Bread Pudding.  I love Bananas, Cinnamon and Bread Pudding so combining them in one dish was awesome.  During my trip I kept thinking of sneaking back some evening just to have this awesome dessert again, but sadly I didn't make it back.",

I was so impressed when Adie and the restaurant manager both remembered me from my last visit 2 years ago. It felt like I was dining with family.  That is what I call True customer service!!!

Thomas was our main server and he was GREAT! My daughter and I shared the Tomahawk Ribeye and it was flavorful and cooked perfectly! ( Only recommendation here, since it was a steak for 2...after presentation it would've been nice for them to have cut it)  Husband had the buffalo ribeye and that was fantastic as well and my daughters friend had the filet! All steaks were cooked  perfect and were flavorful as well as the asparagus and lobster risotto we all shared as sides! Yummy!! Very much enjoyed ourselves! Will be back!!  UPDATE **** February 2019 Well......hmmmm not sure what happened here..... Was looking so forward to returning here after our beyond fabulous meal back in June 2018, unfortunately I can't say the same this time :( I am not sure why so much change to the dining experience, from the menu (which is every meh and lacking of luster and considerably smaller) to the quality of the products served for such a higher \"fine dining\" price. I am a Rib Eye gal, and my rib eye, which cost $59  a la cart, was probably one of the most tasteless and tough steaks I've ever had. Definitely not worth the price. My husband had the Halibut, which was served over pasta, $38, and my husband said it had so much oil from the pasta or preparation that the taste was not enjoyable at all.   We again ordered the Lobster Risotto, which was alright, but a much smaller portion from before, $18, and the dish presentation was completely new. As the the pictures from before, nice serving plates, the risotto this time was served in a small cast iron pan. Again, not \"fine dining\" in my opinion. Neither of us finished our meals, nor did we partake in dessert.  We go to Vegas several times a year, and always stay at the MGM properties, so we visit Tender almost every time in town. It, unfortunately, will be quite a while before we try again. Hoping consistency and quality returns soon.",

My BLT Wedge salad was good, and my husband enjoyed his half chicken, pawns dish but we didn't love this place and its high price tag with food that didn't match our expectations.  The sides were off--the Brussels sprouts reminded both of us of our most feared childhood vegetable because they were grayish-green and slimy in a watery, oily sauce.  I tasted one, and it was less scary tasting--kind of smoky with too much salt and just on the verge of mushy.  It was, we concluded, our parents' generation Brussels sprouts, not even close the the crispy, flavorful morsels I've been obsessed with for the last 10 years.  Pity.   The mushrooms had potential but were over salted by a lot.  The mashed potatoes were creamy but also over salted. The mashed potatoes were the best of the three sides.  As I write this several hours later, I'm still drinking water to recover from all that salt.  Ugh.  We were full and skipped on dessert.",

Not fresh and tasted store bought. Ceaser salad was outstanding, that's why I bumped up a star. On to the main course, we both had the Top Sirloin, they both were cooked to taste, but for the price, I have had better cuts for a fraction of the cost.  The baked potato was tough, I had the garlic mash, good flavor but not sure if instant. A 200 dinner tasted more like a cheap steak house meal! Won't be back.",

    "text": "We went here for a family celebration with 14 people.  The restaurant is beautiful and we were seated in a semi private room which seemed perfect.  Unfortunately, we had a less than perfect experience here.  Our dinner should have lasted 1.5-2 hours but we felt like hostages in this steakhouse for over 3  hours waiting and waiting and waiting for everything with almost no contact from anyone, not even a waiter with a water pitcher!  It took forever to take our orders, forever to bring the food and even longer to bring the check.  When the checks arrived the waiter was so confused and he went back to re-do them several times. Even after correcting one check THREE TIMES it was still incorrect and he told the guest \"Oh yes, I know it is still incorrect.  I will change it when I get to the register\".  He took the credit cards and disappeared for another eternal wait.  I believe the bills were still incorrect when we paid them but everyone was so frustrated we just paid so we could finally leave.    Overall the service was seriously lacking.  Even when the food came none of the servers knew where the plates should go and they seemed confused about what the item was on the plate to even ask whose it was. The food was completely mediocre and yet highly priced.  We were told that the side dishes were good for 2 people but that was incorrect also, luckily we ordered more than one.  Honestly I have had better steaks at Outback steakhouse.  We ordered several desserts for the table-the cheesecake was good, just like a store bought cheesecake-the warm chocolate sphere was a neat show as they melted the chocolate but the taste was actually bad, no one would eat it-the elevated chocolate pyramid was beautiful and tasted fine but not memorable.  Tender steakhouse was a HUGE disappointment.  We had a good experience here in the past, which is what brought us back for this family celebration.  Unfortunately that will be our last visit.",

Very easy to get a table with no reservations on a Monday night. This place is surprisingly very large, with several \"rooms\" of tables.  It's a bit pricey, like any steak house on the Strip. My sister in law went with the Filet Mignon 10 oz size Oscar style, I think that was around $68. My brother and I went with the Ribeye sampler which featured Australian Waygu, Australian Angus, and Bison ribeye in 6 oz portions ($75). The Waygu was fantastic, tender and flavorful, and the Bison had a nice strong flavor as well...both easily outshined the Angus. No sauces were mentioned, and of course sides are individual. I also had the lobster bisque which was very good, but not the best I've had (The Palm still has that title).   Service was prompt and on point. The steaks came out pretty quickly too probably because it wasn't that busy. Steaks were cooked right and seasoned well, not overdone in either category.   Its not the best steakhouse in town, but I was happy with everything.",

Both were good. For our entrees my wife had the filet Oscar style with crab. I had the Kobe filet. Best testing filet I ever had! Our sides were creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. The only issue with the potatoes is that we wished we had more. The services as great. John and team did a great job.",

We needed something quick to eat before we headed out for the evening but were a little too dressed up for the quick food stops or buffet line at the hotel.  We popped into this place after peaking at the menu outside and decided to grab a drink and a few hefty appetizers at the bar so we wouldn't be delayed.  This restaurant is right next to the casino with an open seating bar area as well as a private room for large parties in the back and a regular seating styled restaurant hidden behind the bar.  It was a nice little stop.  We ordered the charcuterie board which had a nice selection of artisan cheeses and meats, the wedge salad with big sweet flavored slices of bacon on top and the mushroom soup.  Everything was delicious but the mushroom soup was the star of the show.  We enjoyed a nice glass of wine and were not rushed at all.",

    "text": "If I based my experience on the food alone, the chef deserves a 4.  The buffalo ribye was served perfect.  Overall, the ambience was warm.  The service was satisfactory.  We had dinner reservations for a party of 5 on Christmas night.  I had trouble finding parking at the Luxor, but the rest of party made the reservation on time.  I came 30 minutes later after parking the car.  The rest of my party was seated.  Here's why I give my experience a low rating based on customer service (this is for the restaurant management):  1)  The young Asian female hostess at the entrance was NOT HELPFUL and very UNPROFESSIONAL.  As I entered the restaurant, I gave her my party name (Eliza G) that was seated already.  Her stoic reply was, \"I guess that they're back toward the left.\"  She didn't bother looking at her monitor to tell me the table.  I walked toward the dining area with no success for 2 minutes.  I finally found a very helpful blond female staff member who wore a red sport coat.  She walked with me back to the Asian not-so helpful to me female hostess who promptly gave the blonde employee the table number where my party was at.  DON'T PISS ME OFF when I'm spending $300+ for dinner that night!  2)  When the very helpful blonde female staff member (KUDOS) took me to the party table.  I was met by a Hispanic male waiter who sarcastically told me, \"You're the one who's late.\"  I gave him a stoic look and took a seat.  I was already frustrated from trying to find parking and dealing with a lethargic hostess.  To the management, please take into consideration your customers.  I don't care for obsequious staff, just friendly service with a positive attitude.",

Let me be clear, hosts, bartenders, servers were all great. This was clearly a management issue. We ordered soup & salad before the meal. The salad was literally rancid. I NEVER return food but there was something very wrong & I wanted the kitchen to know before they served anyone else ate the corrupted food. The server was very nice, took away the salad, took the salad off the bill & gave us a free drink. The manager actively avoided coming to our table for the duration of our meal. The rest of the meal was okay, but after having the taste of the spoiled food, it just all tasted bad from that point on. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and this behavior was truly baffling. Especially compared to the amazing food and service we experienced throughout the rest of the Mandalay & Delano properties. I totally recommend eating everywhere else within the property but we will not return to Tender.",

    "text": "I ate here one night with my wife and my mom on our most recent trip to Vegas.  All of the major hotels in Vegas have a steakhouse, and Tender is the one located in the Luxor.  When I think steakhouses, Tender isn't one that would usually jump to the front of my mind, but we had a $75 comp and were certainly willing to give it a shot.  It definitely had a steakhouse feel to it.  Lots of dark woods and dim lighting.  I thought it had a really nice ambiance.  We were given one of those circular booths, which are nice and cozy.  The prices here are pretty standard for a Vegas steakhouse, though not as steep as you might pay at Wynn or the Bellagio.  You can get a filet from anywhere between $40 to double that, depending on the type/grade of beef you want.  As with most steakhouses, all of the sides are a la carte.  They give you a bread basket that has a really nice selection of various breads.  It was quite good.  For our meals, we split a caesar salad, as well as the tomato mozzarella salad.  Each of us ordered the standard filet for our meal.  We added one side of potatoes for the table.  All of this was more than plenty to fill us up.  We didn't even have room for dessert.  The food was great, and the service was excellent throughout the meal.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience.  I honestly had no idea what to expect from this place.  Overall, everything was very good, and I can't find anything to complain about.  We'll be back here if we ever stay at the Luxor.",

    "text": "Honestly our experience have been a 5 star one as we had a 75$ coupon (on a minimum order of 150$ without taxes and tips), but the place is definitely overpriced just like any other steakhouse in Vegas.  The meat was incredible, very tasty and very well cooked. The fact that a 70$+ sampler of 3 filets (nor any other entree) doesn't even include a side though is little too much even for Vegas.  But again, the quality is there so if you want to taste some great meat and especially if you want to know where every single cut comes from... Tender is a place you should definitely visit.  Service was top notch and deserved a 20% tip without any doubt.  Out of our budget without an offer like this so it's quite unlikely we'd go back in the near future, but reccomended is steak is your way of life! :)",

Two of the side dishes were very good.  The truffle mac n cheese was outstanding and the garlic mashed potatoes were quite good.  The lobster risotto was a disappointment.  The flavor was lacking, the rice was too al dente, and the dish was pretty much cold on arrival.  The wagyu beef chili was outstanding, and had great kick.  The service was on point, and friendly.  Their bread and pesto were outstanding.  We would eat here again, but the meal for two, with one glass of wine was $230.",

I saw that they had a tuna sashimi appetizer and thought, eh, I'm not that hungry anyways, and we all get what we want....  The food came out pretty quickly, but it turns out only one of us actually liked what we got. On top of it, the quality of my sashimi was sub par to say the least. Very disappointing. They literally just took the scraps from the tuna they serve as an entree and clump it together three different ways.  The stars are for our waiter - he was very attentive and went out of his way to see that we could bring our unfinished bottle of wine home =)",

He noticeably was irritated by that and said waters will be there shortly.  He arrived back within a few minutes and we still weren't ready to order.  This seemed to further upset him.  My wife did order a beer at that point.  It took almost ten minutes for him to return to take out order.  Nobody in our party likes seafood, so the appetizer selection didn't appeal to us.  We ordered a couple of salads to start, which were delicious.  When our meals came, two of us ordered the filet mignons.  Mine was surprisingly all fat, which is truly odd for a filet.  We both ordered the filet, butterflied medium rare.  My sisters was well done and mine was more towards medium well.  They re-did my sisters steak first while I tried to eat mine.  When my sisters returned it was cooked perfectly.  It did take 15 minutes for that steak to return.  I then had asked that mine be re-done.  It took almost 20 minutes, only to come back out close to being well done, again.  By this point, everyone was done eating and I couldn't eat my steak.  The manager seemed not to really care.  At the end of the meal, I asked to speak with the manager.  The server said it was not necessary because he removed my steak from bill.  I thanked him for that.  I was still bothered by the lack of concern from the manager.  For being a fine dining restaurant, and also that I am a manager at a upperscale  restaurant; I expected more from this dining experience.",

Started with warm bread that they bring to all the tables with whipped butter.  Caesar salad was fresh and crisp with thin pieces of toasted bread and toasted parmesan cheese. Clean crunch in every bite and not too much dressing.  New York steak was tender, flavorful and superb. Had the mushrooms and onions with it, complemented each other really well. Staff was nice, sat me at a table instead of at the bar.  Will be back when in Vegas! P.s. was so good, forgot to take pictures.",

Tender meat for your orders of steak right? Instead you got medium cooked 40 oz. ($135) tomahawk steak as chewy as you can possibly imaging. When telling waiter, he did not even apologize or comment on it, we each ate less than 1/3 of the steak, and think the salad were actually the highlight of the meal. Looking at neighboring tables, pretty much the same thing, steak were not even half way finished....",

My sister's steak was undercooked which is easy to fix but shouldn't have to be. My steak was good but I've had better! Everyone else's meals were good but the reason for my low review is they charged us for water!!! Granted it was only 3 dollars which is nothing except that THEY CHARGED US FOR WATER!!!

Everything you'd expect from a steakhouse: a clean and classy decor, dim lighting, older men with escorts aplenty, a faint scent of cigarettes mixed with Febreeze.    Our service was excellent as Dewey was attentive and kind.  As a group, we ordered the 24oz Porterhouse prime rib, Mac and cheese, Yukon mash potatoes, steak burger with duck bacon, tomato bisque soup.  Have to say our food was good, but not as good as other steakhouses I've been to.  Mac n cheese was a bit dry for my liking.  Steak lacked flavor and I wish they would have recommended a sauce to put on it.  We left with empty wallets and empty stomachs as the sides were quite small for 2-3 people.    All in all, I left unenthused and kinda wished I went somewhere else.  This place wasn't bad, just didn't give you the bang for your buck you'd expect.  I guess its my bad for even eating inside Luxor, but what can I say, I'm an optimist.",

We had to wait about ten minutes after arriving to a restaurant on a Saturday evening that wasn't hardly busy. The hostesses were very short and rude to us.   Okay so we sit and are given the menus.   The steak is outrageously expensive for the poor quality of food.  Nothing was extra ordinarily spectacular.  I was expecting a fantastic flavorful steak for $90. On top of the steak the side are a la carte at $9 for each side. We got fries, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Nothing special about the sides and the asparagus was a little to crunchy for my taste.    The waiters were very nice, treated us respectfully and was on top of keeping our drinks full!!  The lady that takes pictures was Friendly and outgoing but one photo at a dinner table was $65 and she wouldn't take a photo of us with our phones even after we purchased one of her photos.   We didn't use the bathrooms not sure they even had one or if you have to use the bathrooms in the casino like most restaurants in casinos.  The facility was actually quite dirty, which again was surprising for the cost of the food.   If you come here good luck, I'd much rather find a buffet to eat at over Tenders.",

First, when I made the reservation, they made it a big deal that I was dressed business casual. I show up and everyone is in shorts and t-shirts.  Second, there is a prix fixe menu and they didn't bother to show it to me (since it has the special discount early prices). Third, I had a reservation, but when we sat down, they told us there were no booths available.  After I sat down, we looked around the room and there were 6 booths with no one there. I saw the reservation book and there no other reservations.  Fourth, food was so so. All the sides were drowned in olive oil (mushrooms and potatoes).  Steak was so so. Go to ruth chris, much better. Fifth, we got our bill before we even got desert.  I expect that from mcdonalds, but a 4 dollar sign fancy restaurNt???  If I could, I would have tender owe me stars.  We did get two waiters and a bus boy. I waiter and bus boy were good... Other waiter sucked.  Only go to this place if you have free dining vouchers..and even if you did, ask for new vouchers and go elsewhere.",

I ordered the Kobe meatloaf with \"foie gras and truffle\" which were either in minute quantities are not in the dish because I didn't notice either.  The portion was small and food was ok, but not great. One of the members of our group found rocks in his food and they tried to claim it off as uncooked rice.  As Indians who probably eat rice for 2 meals a day quite frequently, this felt like an insult to our intelligence.  The waiter was brash and didn't bother to apologize for it either.  The food is way overpriced and the service is average at best. Go somewhere else if you want a good dining experience.",

It was 6pm, New Years Eve, and they were able to accommodate us. Awesome! My first thought was...uh oh, does that mean the food isn't that great? We ordered our drinks: jack & coke, and I had the \"Summer Delight\" which was too sweet for me. My husband had the oysters which he said tasted fresh. For my main meal I ordered the \"8oz organic & Range-Fed Filet Mignon\". I asked for medium well and although there was some pink, it tasted great. Unfortunately the steak did not come with a side dish so thankfully I also ordered the \"Baked Truffle Mac & Cheese\" which was delicious. My husband ordered the \"lamb tasting\" plate and his came with a side of potatoes. He cleaned up his plate. We had a Maroon 5 concert to attend so we didn't have time to order dessert. :(  Overall, we're glad we serendipitously found this place.",

    "text": "This is one of the places where if you have to ask the price, you can't afford it. If you're not interested in throwing a Ben Franklin and then some at dinner, find somewhere else. Chances are you would have already known that, since if you don't make a reservation, the odds are pretty low you're getting in.   But all this is to know what you're in for. Vegas, despite being sort of a piece of crap in many ways, does have some very high end restaurants, where nothing is left to chance, all the way down to the decor which is rather dim and inviting and features heavy wood paneling quite heavily. The food is generally outstanding and if this isn't the highest end joint in the city, it's in the running. If you're with a large group, expect a fleet of staff, including one guy who does nothing but explain what's what and also how to eat it, if you need that. Expect the manager coming over to earnestly inquire as to your satisfaction. Expect to tell him everything is great because it will be.  This reminds me somewhat of Spencer's in Salt Lake, with their meticulous attention to detail. The actual menus are different (I somewhat prefer Spencer's overall), as far as sides and appetizers (Spencer's is much better) and exclusivity of cuts of meat (this one has more of those), but they are still of the same very high quality. It's hard to isolate anything I had as less than very good, as all of it was top notch, top shelf and trying to choose shortcomings is largely just nitpicking.   You can't go wrong with any of the steaks or anything red meat related, including surf and turf. Venture into the other meats at your own risk. I also highly recommend the creamed spinach. Thank me later. The menu is overall pretty well thought-out and designed and the chef at the helm executes as near-flawlessly as I've seen. Every one of the presentations was magnificent. If you want the \"big night out\" and are willing to pay for it, this should be a definite contender (no pun...well maybe).",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of pretentious people or restaurants. So the whole vibe was rubbing me the wrong way when they handed me the menu and I saw that the least expensive \"real\" steak was $45.  Our waiter was fantastic. He offered us the house specials, his recommendations, and giggled when we went against his advice. For desert we ordered a $10 slice of peanut butter pie (against his advice) and it was so tiny that it wouldn't even fill and elf. We asked if this was a sample and he said, \"No, I'm sorry, tee hee, that's all you get! Tee hee!\" (I warned you!)  The food was good but I've been spoiled with too many steaks done over charcoal. Pan fried meats turn me off.  Honestly, I'd rather have hamburger over mesquite charcoal than a filet mignon cooked on a pan.  All in all it was a great meal but when I know I could have had a better meal someplace else for less than the tip I feel like and idiot.",

    "text": "Decided to splurge a bit at TENDER during a recent stay in Las Vegas.  We had early reservations for Tuesday evening, so we were among the first patrons to arrive.  The layout of TENDER is nicely done; there's a bar area in the front with the host/hostess station, and the interior is divided into separate rooms with open walkways between them.  The layout allows the restaurant staff to adapt the seating to the level of business; a room could be mostly seated and seem lively and bustling even if 3/4 of the restaurant were empty, or guests could be spread out effectively even if the place is slammed.  For guests, that means that you're unlikely to feel like the place is dead or like it's too busy no matter when you go (unless they are truly full to capacity with a long wait, which certainly didn't happen during our Tuesday visit).  The service was exemplary; we were treated as honored guests during our visit, from quick seating at our arrival, to unobtrusive but careful attention during our meal.  Our servers were very professional and polished; the effect was almost like having a personal footman for our table.  I ordered the heirloom tomato salad, and split the ribeye trio special with my wife: 6oz cuts of the range-fed bison, the New Zealand black angus, and the Texas wagyu, all medium rare.  My wife ordered a side of creamed spinach.  I also ordered a Chimay Blue with dinner; it was a pleasant surprise to see it available on the beer and wines list.  The heirloom tomato salad was good, similar to a caprese salad (but without basil).  We were excited to try and directly compare the three different ribeyes, so when they arrived we sampled each in turn right away.  To my surprise, we both liked the bison the best; it seemed to have the most marbling and was both very tender and tasty, though it did also have the highest ratio of fat to trim off.  Conversely, I was underwhelmed by the Texas wagyu; there was absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I had expected it to be my favorite with superior tenderness and taste, and I found it to be similar to other cheaper ribeyes I've eaten.  It was still very good, but I couldn't find anything exceptional about the texture or flavor.  The creamed spinach was excellent as well (if you like creamed spinach).  Overall, the experience was very positive, and the food was very good.  We enjoyed our evening and would certainly go back.  If I had to pick something that would set this place apart from a Ruth's Chris, it would be the service, which I found to be every bit as attentive and a bit friendlier (though of course service can vary from server to server).  As a disclaimer, we did not try any seafood dishes during our visit, so I can't speak to the seafood quality.  If it's in line with the steak, I doubt you'd be disappointed.  I have seen many other reviews refer to the prices as unusually high or exorbitant, but overall they are really in line with equivalent prime steakhouses.  The prices at TENDER are almost exactly what you'd pay at the Ruth's Chris up the strip.  The menu is posted online, so you can form your own opinion before deciding to go.  Definitely recommended if you're near Luxor and looking to visit a prime steakhouse!",

Just find it off from a steakhouse with music of Michael Jackson's Beat It or Katy Perry's or NSync's. Hilariously weird. Food: Steak = portion's huge, split the steak with BF 20 oz  ribeye. They split it already. Perfectly cooked, but the taste is a bit off, maybe because of aged 28 days. But then Gallagher's aged theirs but still have a very nice taste to it. Scallops = BF said its a bit overcooked to his liking, a bit more chewy Lobster Mac N Cheese = OK, not too many lobster bits on it. Sweet Corn = Good, but prefer Envy's wayyyy better.  All in all, I will dine here again only if I have another food voucher, otherwise.... NEXT!!!",

    "text": "Last night was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had at a nice place like this.   Steak and lobster.  Fillet rare when ordered medium.  Lobster was barely warm and bland.  The service was less than expected too.   When I asked for some assistance with my undercooked food the server said it was rare not even med-rare let alone the medium I ordered and took it back.   They brought back the same cut up piece of meat that we dissected together at the table to confirm it was undercooked before we sent it back to the kitchen.   Where am I at Sizzler or a fine dining restaurant?   It gets better. After complaining about serving me scraps the manager asked if I would like a whole new steak. I told her yes, the first time maybe but not after 20 minutes of this!   At this point the lobster is gone the sides are almost gone and I didn't come here and order steak and lobster to be forced to eat one item at a time.   Bring a new plate all together the way I ordered it. Remember this wasn't even close. Two stages off on your cooking temperatures. The center was slightly warm or even room temperature you blew it!  I opted to just cancel the steak. My son was done eating and as mentioned most of my other dishes were finished also.   Then the bill came and they charged me for the sauce that I was not able to eat because I had no steak! Now this morning I noticed they have charged me full price for a lobster dinner vs. the add on price of 39.00 for lobster to be added to any meal as the menu clearly states.  Hence steak AND lobster.   My wife and I enjoyed this place several years ago and enjoyed it so much we dined their two nights in a row.   Obviously chef Kenneth Fazel was either not running this place at that time or if he was in fact the chef during our previous visits he must have recently taken up Smoking crack because it was a night and day difference from previous experiences.  Either this guy doesn't deserve to be at these type's of establishments or he needs to clean house and start over!!!!  I'm not talking about just blowing it on a steak. You guys blew it on several levels.   A very disappointed local!!!!",

Girlfriend and I both got the filet medium rare, broccoli, asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, and lobster bisque with pinot grigio to drink.  Steaks were juicy and well cooked.  I added the A1-style homemade sauce (bomb!) and a crab medallion (make your own surf and turf for half the price.  Total bill with tip was under $200 for 2 people.  There is a $20 off coupon in all the rooms if you stay at the hotel.     Only thing stopping this place from getting 5 stars is that it lacks windows or a view.  For this reason, I still prefer the Range at Harrah's for Vegas steak.",

This was the best reward that we used. Their food is amazing, but a little pricey. It was nice though because we had the credit. They have a wide variety of wines, but we decided to get cocktails. I got their elite margarita which was good. Also a lemon drop, also good. We then got a hummus, peppers, and olives trio with pita bread and crackers for an appetizer. That was also really good. For dinner, we both got a skirt steak with a side of Garlic mashed potatoes. We also got a side of these chopped baked potatoes with cheese and sour cream. All of it was amazing. For dessert, we got their sampler which came with a cheesecake, a triple chocolate cake, and a vanilla creme brule. The brule was a favorite. It came with a sugar cookie also. During our dinner they also came by to take a couple pictures of us. Although they aren't complimentary with your pricey dinner, you do have the option of purchasing them at the end of your meal. Overall, the food is pricey but you get what you pay for. It was all amazing! I definitely recommend.",

I wanted another glass of wine and dessert but it took so long for anyone to come by I just gave up.

That aside, I never eat red meat, but this place is the exception! Honestly, if all steaks were this good, I would be an incorrigible carnivore.   My husband always orders the exotic plates--wild game and the like. He advocates for this. I love my husband and usually value his opinion, but I would suggest that if you order anything except the filet, you are crazy.  They have an organic grass-fed filet option, but I went with the Kobe beef.  I plan to dream about it again tonight.  Side dishes are excellent and include the standard steakhouse fare like potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and asparagus.  Dessert list includes the necessary chocolate options like chocolate souffle.  I am still not convinced that this isn't what Meg Ryan ordered during the famous \"When Harry Met Sally\" scene.  Very pricey, but totally. Worth. It. Do yourself a favor and opt for the cheese plate as an appetizer. It's the best thing ever.  And make sure to visit whenever you're in Vegas!",

After being tempted by the steak menu (which looks amazing) finally i decided to make a reservation for the wife's birthday. On the website it clearly states locals get a 15% discount. Clearly. So i called the week before to make a reservation for Monday Aug 10th-not a holiday that i know of. I made my reservation then asked about the discount only to be told they don't honor that anymore! ITS ON THE WEBSITE! I emailed the Luxor to explain why i canceled my reservation-and they told me they honor whats on there website(-holidays and weekends i believe) So the hostess has 3 jobs. To take reservations, seat people & know the offers the restaurant has! If she/they cant get that simple communication right-this place isn't worth the phone call i made. I think based on this basic screw up i would not feel comfortable blowing $150-200 for a dinner. To many options in town",

We were in shorts and flip flops, but they let us in.  It wasn't crowded at all, the service staff was very nice and the food was delicious.  We both ordered the Bone in Rib Eye 22 oz medium with corn and garlic mashed potatoes.  The sides were kind of on the small side, but they were good.  Also ordered a reasonable price bottle of Syrah ($32) that was very smooth.  The food was on par if not better then some of the more known local steak houses such as Ruth Chris and Morton's.  The interior atmosphere was more along the lines of Morton's, with the dark wood, cigar bar feel to it.    It almost seems out of place at the Luxor, as the Luxor isn't known for being high end, but it is close to the mandalay bay connection point.  For a good steak I would recommend Luxor's Steakhouse anyday.",

    "text": "I'm staying at the Luxor and made reservations to try this place at the hotel as recommended by a manager at guest services.  When we got there, the hostess greeted us and told us they needed to set up the table and it'll be about 10 minutes.  Well the place had about 10 empty tables and booths(I didn't expect this bc I made reservations), so they told us to sit by the lounge area.    A waitress came by to see if we wanted cocktails, but we're not big drinkers and told her we'll order at dinner.    the atmosphere was very elegant and walls and ceilings were dark wood with dim lighting.  the booths were nice and looked good, but it's never fun to slide into the seats.  At Lawry's steakhouse, the waiter pulls out the table so you can get in easy........maybe they should do the same here.  we were sitted in the booth and our waiter Chuck was very nice and patience with us..........as we took forever to order.    I ordered the prix fix menu for $39. and you get to pick either mushroom soup or salad with a balsamic dressing.  Entree choices were salmon; chicken breast or beef filet.  Dessert was creme brulee; cheesecake or flourless chocolate cake.  I choose salad, beef filet and chocolate cake.   Also, ordered a glass of cabernet savignon red wine for $19. which was very good with my dinner.  the salad came out, but no one offered fresh pepper on it.  I waited a few minutes and asked Chuck for pepper and he went to bring over a salt and pepper shaker for our table.  This was a surprise bc I would think of this as a high end restaurant and they should grind fresh black pepper on my salad when they served it.  The salad was very good, but was lacking fresh walnuts or some kind of nut.  the beef filet was just as I ordered it medicum rare and was tender, melt in you mouth yummy good.  the carmelized onions was yummy too.  I ordered extra red wine sauce to go with my beef, but it didn't need it.  They offer you several choice of sauces for your entree for an extra $3., but this dish didn't need it as it had very good flavor by itself.    The flourless chocolate cake with a dab of whip cream was okay.  I'm not use to eating a chocolate cake with no flour, but it wasn't bad.  I just don't understand what's so great about a chocolate cake w/o flour.  This was the least fattening of the 3 choices.  My dining partner order the short rib ($25.) and ala carte yukon mashed pototoes ($7.)  It came out tender and melt in your mouth good and the mashed potatoes were perfect with it.  Chuck, our waiter who's been there for 17 years explained about their dishes and how they were cooked.  We enjoyed hearing the behind the scene of the restaurant.     Overall,  the restaurant appears be high end . there are several other dining room areas and the bathrooms were elegant with cloth hand towels.  Our experience of the food was good, but we were surprised at:  ie. they didn't offer fresh ground pepper when they served the salad,   The staff was not snobby and that was nice, but  Chuck was a friendly waiter, the others were very professional I thought and helpful.  I would recommend this restaurant.  It's pricey, but if you want a nice treat...........it's a good decent restaurant.",

It was very quiet considering we were right off the casino floor.  Nice Morton's type atmosphere with very attentive wait staff. Started out with a round of drinks.  Loved the Manhattan and my dad said it was the best Long Island Iced Tea he'd had in awhile.  Hubby had some firewater kind of cocktail that was very spicy.  I had the baby lettuce salad, which was their twist on the standard wedge salad.  It was fantastic and much easier to eat than a wedge! Pops had a standard tossed salad that was a nice size. Hubby had hangar steak ($27) with a humongous baked potato.  Pops and I had the Omaha fillet ($40) and it melted in my mouth.  OMG best steak ever! We were too full for dessert.  Note that everything is ala carte, but they have prix fixe menus that were very reasonable for 3-4 courses.",

I appreciated how they pre-cracked the shell for me, as King Crag legs tend to be spiney and painful to open.  Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for, and their drinks are good if a little weak.  I give the place four stars because it took a good 10 minutes for anyone to help us.  The person that was supposed to be our server never showed.  However, we didn't have a reservation and it was close to closing, so I can't complain too much.  Considering the food we got, the price really wasn't so bad.  The Kobe beef can run you over $100 a steak, but my crab legs were $40 and my boyfriend's filet mignon was $40.  The deliciousness was worth every penny.",

We enjoyed our New Year's Eve dinner here. My husband and I split the Winter Garden Greens Salad. Greens were fresh and not wilted. The vinaigrette was very tasty. Interestingly we were not offered fresh cracked pepper.  My husband ordered the black angus beef hanger tender (10 oz) with a side of grilled asparagus and Yukon mashed potatoes. The beef was very tender and not overly seasoned. The vegetables were also well prepared.  I ordered my favorite the veal osso buco over a creamy polenta. Wow, it was rich and savory. It comes on a bed of polenta along with onions, potatoes and celery. I'll have another please...  A bit disappointed in desert.  Knowing how long a souffle takes to cook I let the server know that I would be having the dark chocolate souffle when we ordered our entree. He was a bit surprised by my request and said it would be fine to order it after my meal. So I did and low and behold it came to the table under cooked. Geeee what a surprise. So we asked that another be brought to the table cooked. 15 minutes later another souffle appeared slightly better then the first. I ate a little of it and left the rest. Long story short, the server did not charge us for the souffle. Kudo's to him.  We will return!",

I asked them to redo my steak, the waiter unhappily took it to the kitchen and brought it back per the chef's request to show me that part of it was cooked as I asked.  As if I was going to eat just the third that was cooked as i requested. Rude and unprofessional. Steak lesson: the steak has to have the same thickness to cook properly! They gave me a piece of filet that was shaped like an uneven pyramid (clearly not pretty either).  Kudos to a lady (likely a manager) that tried to address the issue, but the chef must have been clearly upset because he then sent me a piece of cold meat that wasn't even seasoned (not even salt was added to it).  Never going back, never recommending to anyone.",

Drinks were AWESOME, the cocktail waitress shook our cocktails for us table side... THANK YOU.  The cheese plate we shared was delicious, although it always amazes me why places give so few slices of bread for the cheese... there were like 6 slices and 4 girls.   My friend got her kobe beef burger and skinny fries... she likes her meat very well done but when I tried it it was still juicy. I had the meatloaf sliders which were pretty good, although the artichoke/seaweed spread it came with just tasted odd to me. Wasn't crazy about the crab sliders, the consistency was a little rubbery and I'm happy I didn't order it.   Decor is sexy, dark and comfortable... there's a lot of dark wood paneling, antler chandeliers, and very nice bathrooms that remind me of the Member's Only clubs in London.   Although I was originally hesitant about trying Tender's I'm happy we went here and do recommend if you're looking for a better meal but don't want to deal the the hassle of those other trendy spots.",

These were the fruitiest, juiciest tomatoes I have ever tasted. Buffalo mozzarella was top notch too; melted in your mouth.  We actually smelled the fishy smell right as the waiter placed the salmon dish on the table. It must have been sitting in that freezer for a good while before they cooked it. The dish was totally sub par, I didn't even finish it. The garlic mash it came with was good but I've had better for the price.  So yeah, stick with the antelope.",

Our food came in a very timely manner and everyones steaks were cooked perfectly--all 16 meals arrived at the same time and were all hot.

Those less than stellar reviews are justified.  My filet was ordered medium rare and arrived medium/medium well. It was sent back and I recieved a replacement that was closer to rare, but acceptable. The red wine sauce that was brought out with the first steak was left instead of being replaced or reheated for the new steak. The meat (and sauce for that matter) was lacking in flavor.   The wife's seafood sampler of crab, salmon, a whitefish and something else was well presented but also lacking in flavor.  The sides of truffled mashed potatoes and mac and cheese (I have a carbohydrate deficiency if you must know) were above average, but certainly not nearly as good as those at other steakhouses like Bellagio's Prime.  Next time, if this is the best restaurant at the Luxor I would eat elsewhere instead.",

Our tomato and mozzarella salad was very good, although a bit pricey at $18. The steaks (which should have been the main attraction) were the big let down...  My wife ordered a filet cooked medium, and it was medium rare / rare. I ordered a medium rare bone-in ribeye, which had two problems: First, it was medium / medium well, and IT HAD NO BONE.  I brought this to the food runner's attention, and he says, \"Yes, it HAS a bone...\" I jabbed my knife several times into various parts of the steak with vigor and feeling vindicated, I proudly say, \"See? No bone!\" He stares blankly and says, \".....Well, it HAD a bone,\" and walks away!   \"Ok, don't panic,\" I tell myself, \"the SERVER will make this right!\" When I explain the whole bone-gate scandal, his response is, \"Yes, it HAS a bone!\" At this point, I gave up. When the manager comes around to ask if everything is wonderful, I explain to her that my wife and I have traded steaks, and her response was that she'd tell the chef to watch those steaks in the future. Shouldn't he have been watching them all night? Why were we \"Patient Zero?\"   Anywho, we won't be returning. For that much money, they should be able to nail a steak temperature way better than you or I can at home on the grill, and their first test on hiring waitstaff should be \"Bone Recogniton 101!\"",

My girlfriend and I shared it,  2 sides and 2 glasses of wine and it was $110! I knew it would be expensive but had we not shared the meal it works have been $200 before top and tax.  Too much in my opinion.",

    "text": "Before heading in to see Believe Nick and I decided to make a big night of it and eat a nice dinner. Every hotel has a steakhouse so it wasn't like we looked over all the menus or anything to pick this one. It was chosen sheerly by the virtue of being in the same place as the show we were seeing. With that said I felt it was a very, very good choice.  We started with a cheese plate that had 3 types of cheese and accoutrements for a mere $14, which I thought was very reasonable. I appreciated the fact that they had a good assortment to choose from, I think around 10 cheeses. I also had a glass of champagne and Nick had a Chimay. Both of these I still found to be a pretty good deal, considering where we were in terms of city and restaurant style.  After that we shared a salad with comice pears, smoked bacon and blue cheese, roasted fingerling potatoes with creme fraiche and chives, and grilled asparagus in a lemon citrus olive oil in addition to our main entrees. I had a black angus Niman beef strip steak and Nick had a Berkshire Heritage pork with apricot chutney, both of which were cooked exactly the way we ordered them and were priced in the mid to high 30s.  While, this was definitely an expensive meal it was also a meal worth the price. We had the dual servers so when one wasn't around to help us the other was no matter what we needed. There is something about this system that I really like because you have two familiar faces so you're never left without drink refills or other necessities, but they also aren't done by a stranger each time so you get a sense of familiarity throughout your meal.",

    "text": "There are many steakhouses in Vegas. A great meal at a top steakhouse will cost about $80.00 - $120.00 per person including 1-2 drinks + appetizers and dessert and coffee. But the dining experience at this high lebel should be exceptional ...in fact, every part of the meal should be exceptional:  the quality of the food, the service, the ambiance, etc.  My advice?  Select another restaurant or another steakhouse. This one is not a top steakhouse, but commanding $$$$ as if it was of that caliber. Should I have received a warm steak? Should I be required to wait for a steak knife after being serve the steak? Should I need to find the waiter for ground pepper? Should I need to remove pieces of muscle/tendons that cannot be chewed? Should I need to be grilled twice about these issues by the manager? Should the quality of the steak be of a high level so that I would not need to return it? Should I need to find the waiter to request coffee?  I cannot return here. There are other ways to lose money at a casino.",

    "text": "The good, the bad and the ugly  The good : the food. The salad was amazing. One of the best things I've eaten at a restaurant. The steaks were good but I cook them better on my charcoal BBQ. The side dishes are separate and if you don't order many you'll end up just with steak, a detail I didn't like.  The bad : the service. The maitre D was, well, I can't write it here. Fortunately she wasn't with us for a long time. The first waiter we got was all huffing and puffing, trying to impress us. When he saw we didn't respond to his machismo, he left us and a bored woman ended up servicing us for the rest of the evening, which made the tipping part confusing. That first waiter was point blank rude to drop us for other clients who were entertained by his sideshow antics (this is in Las Vegas after all).  Another bad was that it's overpriced. For example, if you order 4 different veggies separately (as mentioned above, like peas, carrots, asparagus and mushrooms) you end paying $40+ just for something to eat with your steak.  The ugly : the showy waiter stoked a group of 6 or 7 men nearby who were drunk, extremely rude and obnoxious, and not necessarily in that order. We could barely hear ourselves at our table. The loud waiter and the loud men at that table basically ruined our evening there which wasn't cheap. If it wasn't because of them, the meathead of a waiter who prompted the obnoxious customers all along and the b**** of a maitre D. this place would have gotten 4 stars.",

Service was cold and emotionless and the atmosphere was so far from upscale or romantic...their whole website was a complete misleading Falsehood!!!  In fact had we not made reservations and they immediately brought out bread, we would ABSOLUTELY have left!!!! $200 that I could have saved...and completely ruined my anniversary!!!

The first night they Overcooked my porterhouse; I was sitting in the bar and I actually had great service there. Including a very responsive manager. So I decided to come back another night and see if they could get my steak right.  I came back another night and had the porterhouse again, this time it was cooked right, but since my order the an alcoholic drink my server turned off. The porterhouse steak had a ton of gristle in it.  To top it off, they charged me more for my ice tea in the restaurant and they did at the bar which was five dollars, unacceptable. I won't be going back sadly.",

    "text": "This is a solid steakhouse with a menu that has a large variety of choices--something for almost everyone. I had a reservation for 6:15 and I was greeted on arrival by two very pleasant ladies.  One of them showed me to my table and it was the first encounter with the friendly and attentive staff that work here.  I studied the menu online before I went and I had narrowed my decision to two choices, the Japanese Kobe wagyu A-5 filet or the wild game tasting of three game foods.  The waiter went through some special items that weren't on the menu and he threw a curve ball at me by telling me they had a bison tasting menu with 3 preparations of bison.  I knew they were having bison during July, and this sounded really good.  After some discussion with the server, I opted to order the Kobe filet as I have not tried real Japanese waygu before.   For starters, I ordered the soup tasting trio and got the lobster bisque, the heirloom tomato, and wild mushroom flavors.  The soup comes in a container with three small wells for the soups.  It gives you a chance to taste three of their four soups.  The lobster bisque was good and even this small portion had some lobster pieces in it.  The tomato was absolutely the best.  Very flavorful.  The weakest of the three was the wild mushroom soup.  I thought it was a bit thin and didn't have a strong mushroom flavor.  The runner ground some fresh pepper into each.  One small nit here was the soups sit on another flat plate.  Since the fit is not quite exact, the soup moved around some and on delivery, some of the tomato had mixed into the other too.  Points off for this on Chopped, I'm sure.  Then came the filet.  With it were 4 pearl onions.  I ordered a side of fries to accompany the steak.  They bring you a small dish with house made ketchup and mustard.  A note on the fries.  Some of the Yelp reviews state they're not crisp fries and they're correct.  The fries have a less than crispy texture and they are oily and pre-salted, just exactly what I like.  I didn't mind the lack of crispness nor the oil.  It's just the way they prepare them so if you don't like fries cooked that way, don't order them.  I very, very rarely use ketchup yet I was drawn to try the mustard and ketchup.  The mustard was OK, but the ketchup was actually better than I expected.  It was sweet, from some small raisins in the mixture.  I didn't dip many fries in it--just enough to try it out a few times--but I was intrigued by how they changed the flavor from the standard bottled kind.  The filet was very tasty and tender.  I had asked for it extra rare, and when my server suggested \"blue\" I responded affirmatively.  It was done a bit more than I like but it was OK.  The only thing here was that on one side of the filet, there was a section that was very sinewy and I was unable to cut it with my knife.  I tore it with the knife and fork into a couple of shreds.  I thought it odd that a cut of Kobe would not have had this trimmed or would even be like this.  Since I expected the steak to be above and beyond anything I'd ever tasted, I began to wonder if in fact I had been served A-5 wagyu but being a neophyte, there was no way I could accurately tell.  Suffice it to say that when I finished the steak, even thought it was very good, I was thinking I should have ordered the bison.    For dessert, I got the bananas Foster bread pudding.  Very tasty and very filling. It was a good ending to the meal.  Service was excellent.  I had Team 1.  I believe one was Raul but I cannot remember the other's name.  My iced tea was refilled regularly, one of the two checked on me throughout the meal, and two other people from the restaurant stopped by to see how everything was.  It was top notch service.  I'm sure I'll be back to Tender to try some of their game meat.  It's a fine restaurant.",

In addition we had dessert!  The service was professional they were not pushy did not rush us brought our drinks out as we asked but were not over bearing and did not stand over us or try to rush us out the door ! I have to say it must be a Las Vegas 5 star standard to let the guests just enjoy their experiences as they wish ! I definitely made us go back again ! My family referred us here and my friends dine here often and invited me here ! Most definitely worth the money and the time !! I highly recommend making the trip to the Luxor !!!!!!",

I am an Mlife member and stay at the Luxor frequently with food comps.  I almost always use the food comp at Tender.  The service here is always great, and I have had several cuts of steak and fish and always been satisfied.  They have a great charcuterie and cheese selection, great happy hour, and nice atmosphere.  So, why a 3 star rating?  Just a couple small reasons.  The bar area is just a little too close to the gaming floor.  The other reason is I've never actually paid full price for a meal here.  The menu prices just aren't in line with other steak houses on the strip for the same price range.  I 100% recommend using your dining credits here.  You won't be disappointed... but if you are, the manager will make sure you feel like you are taken care of.",

    "text": "Located in Luxor with nearly three-hundred seats and the sort of pandering service that describes everything as 'beautiful' or 'amazing,' despite evidencing zero knowledge of the province or preparation technique involved in the cuisine, it was finally on Saturday that myself and two friends sat down at Tender - the combination of a gift certificate and one of the few menus in Las Vegas to offer wild game making up for everything service and the humid, stagnant space lacked.  Heralded by some as a hidden gem, while others find the entire Luxor property almost entirely irrelevant to Sin City's culinary landscape, it was just after 5:30 that our trio sat down in one of several dining rooms and with heavy wood speckled with rustic decor beneath low lighting the upsale specials were largely ignored, a focus on the cheese menu showing far less unique options than those suggested online (and described, oddly, as only available 'at the bar',) leading to a three course menu - one friend's Oysters Rockefeller completely forgotten when the waiter tried to push 'outstanding' tuna tartare while the rest of the order trickled out slowly with minimal description, but excellent execution from the men and women behind the grills.  Having reached out through social media in order to understand how the wild game menu had come to be in such an unexpected space it was not long after warm bread and aromatic pesto arrived that GM James Clare stopped by to say hello and subsequently fetching Chef K.C. Fazel, a gracious man with obvious passion for his products and preparation, the story of Tender's relationship with farmers up north as well as the Chef's Midwestern upbringing soon had me all the more interested in what was to come - not even the frequently empty water glasses, 80F+ temperature, or ongoing \"beautiful,\" \"wonderful,\" \"excellent\" verbiage being fed to each and every table around enough to bring me down.  With the aforementioned oysters forgotten, course one began with two appetizers, and as one friend was treated to a rich broth teaming with tender oxtail, caramelized onions, grilled bread, and cheese that ranks amongst the best I have ever tasted my $19 slice of duck liver a True first glimpse of things to come - the foie gras' sapor more intense than generally seen amongst steakhouse fare with the crispy rice cake providing a texture-rich base more than amicable to sopping up both the offal's residual oils and a drizzle of port wine and juicy red fruit.  Moving on to mains and sides, it was after some delay that seven plates arrived tableside and although presentations were sorely lacking, save for the young man who described the seafood tasting, it would be nearly impossible to find fault in anything save for mundane potatoes - the smoky bone marrow portion exceedingly generous given the $6 tab while both the crispy duck bacon and thick, cheese-imbued rice were equally well prepared, all of them dishes best shared.  Speaking to entrees, for myself the beef was a bit humdrum, though the sear and center were both on-point medium rare, while both tastings were every bit as good as the quality of sourcing, the whitefish admittedly a touch fishy thus allowing both salmon and scallops to steal the spotlight while each constituent of the wild game trio was peerless, the Osso Buco tender and full of funk while both elk and boar delivered on the chef's promise that even his leaner cuts were bound to impress, the latter particularly impressive as smoky saline notes met a perfect foil in housemade chutney.  At this point feeling the effects of a full stomach combined with the restaurant's toasty temperature it was in an elegant iced coffee presentation that I indulged while my tablemate fancied tea and genuinely unable to resist dessert the team at Tender had me at the words \"Bread Pudding,\" the sizable round swimming in a pool of boozed up bananas beneath slowly melting ice cream - an excellent dish its own right but certainly no match for the torched s'mores cake, an absolute stunner that was neither too sweet nor too heavy, something I only wish could have been said for a fallen-on-arrival souffle that was worth neither the twenty minute preparation nor the calories involved.  Flying well below the radar given its gaming-floor adjacent location in Luxor, Tender is at once the sort of 'big meat' place that many envision when thinking of the typical Vegas steakhouse AND the sort of place where a largely unheralded chef has been allowed to carve out a niche that few would expect - if only the front of house could be brought up to speed with the team in the kitchen there is little doubt that this diamond in the rough could shine amongst the city's best.",

We ordered the wedge salad with bacon, the bacon was probably the best piece of pork I've ever had. Got the filet mignon again amazing. Got the bone in ribeye and potatoes au gratin, those two where the ones that made me give this a 4 star instead of a five. Total bill for 2 people $300. Not bad for a restaurant of this caliber. Will be back next time I'm staying here.",

    "text": "Save your money and go *anywhere* else. Getting a slice of greasy pizza and rubbing it on the back of your head would be more satisfying. Tender is a third rate establishment with first class aspirations, but fails miserably and somewhat embarrassingly like Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. What do you expect when you're in the basement of the Luxor?  Dim lighting hides scratched furniture. Waiters being pushy on drinks that are way too strong and poorly mixed. Belike their target customer just tossed their giant neon drinking tub into the waste bin before cruising into Tender, but if you have any level of sophistication in your palate you may want to reconsider.  Still none of that would matter as much if the food was even passable, but after tasting several dishes I have to imagine there's a huddled mass of culinary school dropouts and failed clowns pouring your dinner out of Sysco labeled shrink wrap.  Steaks are overpriced with very low quality beef. Poorly cooked and the sin of no seasoning whatsoever - not even salt and pepper. Zero. WTH. Who hired these people? Instead they try to upsell you one of their crappy \"steak toppings\" no doubt to cover the total lack of flavor in their choice grade meat. The irony is that my ribeye wasn't TENDER. It felt like I was sawing through a warm garden hose.  Look, this review may seem harsh, but you'll want to write one just like it if you make the mistake of eating here. I had the misfortune of having to eat here because a co-worker picked it and sat down before I had a chance to voice an opinion. So take my word for it - I'm trying to save you from a deeply unsatisfying meal.",

Noticed that the server was a bit hesitant on sharing their pre fixe dinners they've been offering.. which I get.. higher check total means more tips.  I didn't order off of the prefixe anyways. Their bone-in rib eye special is worth sharing with someone and their sides are of decent sizes. I do recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good steakhouse on the south side of the Las Vegas strip and for the simple convenience of eating before the show.",

Last night at Tender it started off with the hostess being rude, the wait staff forgetting that we requested lemon in our water and this was the first time we did not get fresh pepper grounded on our food by the wait staff, but the salt and pepper container handed to us for us to do our selves.

Leather booths, large black and white photos on the wall, great ceiling fixtures. They gave us sourdough,  Multigrain and feta bread with olive oil with pesto sauce for dipping. Great start.  I had the ribeye medium rare. It was a pretty good cut of meat. It was seasoned well, tender ans had a good flavor because of their 21 day aging process. Also got their petite lobster addon. Delicious! It came with a tail sliced in half and 2 claws in a rich lobster sauce.  For the sides, we got potatoes lyonnaise au gratin, mushrooms and creamed spinach. The potatoes were perfectly creamy and rich with sour cream and chives on top and lots of melted cheese. The mushrooms were well seasoned, very soft and juicy. And the creamed spinach was perfect. Slightly sweet from the cream and onions and the sauce was really good.  All in all, it was a great meal. I've seen previous menus where they had more variety of steaks. I would like to see thrm bring back the kobe and wagu options. But if you're in luxor and you want a great steak dinner with all the trimmings, look no further than Tender.",

My husband had the Filet and you could cut it with a fork. I had the exotic mushroom soup for an appetizer and it wasn't what I expected (exotic mushrooms in a broth) but it was almost a puree, but the mushroom flavor was wonderful. It was Super Bowl Sunday and we weren't really into a loud crowd, Tender had the game on and it was just an overall wonderful experience.  A huge thank you to our server Robin for making both experiences a wonderful memory.",

Pressure to up sell, to drink more.. we had just arrived after a long drive, really hungry and not looking to have more than 1 drink with dinner. Had a coupon from the Luxor to keep us dining at their casino eatery. Showing the coupon prior to ordering really means you receive sub-par food. For $38 our seafood cioppino looked like it was missing half of it. Of poor quality and we think the shrimp may have been bad. Was sick for 2 days. The Panamanian cobia sea bass for $34 was actually very good but not much of it came on the plate. 1 star added for tasty bass. Had to ask for bread with our meal which is supposed to come with it. Would never come here again, would not recommend. Way too pricey for what you get and I cannot risk getting ill again like that on vaca.",

    "text": "A great location to grab a phenomenal dinner before shows at the Luxor or nearing casinos. The service is a 10 on a 1 to 5 scale. Our wait staff was attentive and ensured that everything they could control was well above standards.   So why did I rate this a 3? This is a steakhouse. And while we were there, the place was 1/2 empty, meaning that the chef(s) were not overwhelmed by a huge rush of orders. However, in our time there, we saw three meals sent back due to meat being undercooked. Two filets at the table next to us, and my lamb. This wasn't simply underdone because we were picky people - the center of these cuts were all rare. Cold & uncooked.  The wait staff was quick to respond and get these resolved, but at a steakhouse of this tier, this occurring 3x in one sitting is simply a red flag.   That said, once cooked properly, the meat was phenomenal. The wine & cocktail list is well above standard. The starters were perfect in size and preparing our pallets for the main course. And dessert was spot-on.   I will qualify that the desserts being spot-on comment had nothing to do with the fact they were comped due to the meat being sent back.  This taken into account, I would actually return. The peripheral meal and experience was phenomenal. Perhaps I'm too forgiving, but I'd still recommend Tender to anyone visiting Vegas looking for a solid steakhouse.",

Food is fantastical!   I've ordered the top sirloin w/some disappointment as I felt it t/b too tough a cut and I've ordered the rib-eye w/great satisfaction indeed. The rib-eye is a huge cut and takes the place of an entire plate by itself!! In addition to, I also ordered a red wine sauce, which I am absolutely in love with, as it brings out so much more flavoring in the meat itself. I also ordered a baked potato w/sour cream butter and chives.  Yummy.   Tender serves an amazing bread basket w/3 varying breads and an olive/pesto sauce for dipping prior to the serving of your meal. It's heavenly.",

    "text": "TENDER steak and & seafood looks like an old-school steakhouse, with its dark leather chairs, hazel floors, and its burnished umber surroundings. But this restaurant in the Luxor also plays by its own rules, offering diners a chance to sample meats like bison, venison and boar.  My first visit here was a late night one. The main restaurant was slowly closing for the night, but the bar and lounge were still open. We ordered a selection of cheeses and the charcuterie board that included wild boar sausage, duck ham, and antelope pastrami. Those quick bites hit the spot, and along with their selection of Belgian ales, led to our decision to visit a second time.      Unfortunately, trip number two was a bit of a disappointment.   First the good. The appetizer I sampled was astounding. It was a short rib ravioli that was cooked to perfection and served with a horseradish marinara sauce and a bit of crisped smoked bacon. I would highly recommend it.  Having dabbled with their game meats the last time I was here, I ordered the wild game tasting as my main. I was feeling adventurous, and I imagined if it was good enough to be on the menu alongside the Omaha beef and Kurobuta pork chops, they knew what they were doing. The tasting included three meats, but sadly, each one was tougher and a bit more disheartening than the last one.   I need to stress that this wasn't my first encounter with wild game. I've typically eaten it in bit and bites, most often in sausage, or cured, or served tartare style, as I did on my first visit to TENDER. I know these meats can be quite tough if cooked less than perfectly, which is why they're often served as charcuterie items. You get the full flavor without having to gnaw through meat that would be better used to make Lady Gaga a Grammy dress.  The wild boar loin was the best of the lot and did echo this restaurant's name, but the venison medallion served alongside it was a bit too dense. Venison tends to be drier than beef, because it lacks the same kind of fat marbling in its meat, and this cut was cooked just a bit too long for my liking. Next.  The Nilgai antelope osso buco was even more vexing. A perfect osso buco is cooked low and slow and falls off the bone. This one was simply unyielding. To be fair, I've never cooked antelope myself, much less in an osso buco, but my understanding is that the process is very similar to the veal version, and the meat should be cooked slowly until it is fork tender. This was not the case on this night, and most of the meat on my plate remained uneaten.  It's truly unfortunate, because this dish was priced at $36, which is not unreasonable. It's low enough where one might be willing to gamble that amount for a new foodie experience -- this is Vegas after all -- and a fair price for the exotic meats  included in this tasting. But they were definitely not representative of what they could be, and I would hate to think someone might be enticed to try them (as I was) and leave with the wrong impression:   \"I went to Vegas and ate antelope! It wasn't that good. It was dry and tough. It's probably just a gimmick, but I can scratch it off my bucket list.\"   I am not, however, ready to condemn TENDER completely, and might try a regular steak there some day, just to see if they've got the chops to handle the chops. I did really like the side I ordered with my sampler -- a trio of exotic grains that included a quinoa and corn pilaf,  farro piccolo, and black forbidden rice.   I am also fond of the cheeses they have available, that are typically served with fresh baguette, honeycomb, dates, quince paste and a cherry fig chutney. I would suggest the cabernet sauvignon soaked Purple Moon Cheddar from California's San Joaquin Valley, the nutty Marieke gouda from Wisconsin, and the butter-like San Andreas sheep's milk cheese from Valley Ford, California, if they're ever on the menu.",

Started with two waiters~ one nice and one mediocre. Cocktails with cold bread and basil olive oil...yummy (just wished it was warm) .  Next up mushroom soup and lobster bisque~ so good! The soup had five kinds of mushrooms (including truffles) and tasted amazing (served warm...wished it was hotter) . Lobster bisque had good portion of lobster. Next up was chef's special: filet trio to split with accompaniment of duck bacon and blue cheese on the side. Loved it! We also had the garlic mash with truffles and asparagus~ very good. Tab was $185 and worth very penny.  HINT: Plan on $100 per person...it is worth it. Also, ask for bread warm, and don't be in a hurry. I noticed most complaints are the price and time- this is a place to enjoy and not be in a rush.",

It's located in a property I don't frequent often, so it allowed me to venture outside of my comfort zone. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I liked the fact that it was split into several dining areas, which gave it a more intimate feeling.  The food and service were both spot on. Our server was very attentive throughout the meal, kept drinks filled, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I started with one of the special salads he mentioned... beefsteak tomato and mozzarella. It was one of the largest caprese salads I've ever had, but the amount of tomatoes heavily outnumbered the amount of mozzarella on the plate. It was still delicious, nonetheless. My husband enjoyed a nicely prepared caesar salad. We both ordered filets, which were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and shared a side of parmesan potato wedges. The potatoes were good, but it wasn't quite that sharable size I'm used to seeing on a la carte sides.  I would definitely recommend this unassuming steak house to others. It's a nice change from some of the high end steak houses in other Vegas properties that charge more for food that is equally as good.",

    "text": "I had a reservation last night 04/16/14 at 7:30pm under the name \"Michael\"  To be fair let's start with the positive aspects of this establishment - the environment, ambiance decor and proximity to Luxor is 5 star and made me give it another try hoping the first visit was a fluke.   THE DINNER, WAITER, AND ESPECIALLY THE WINE - SUCKED.     The appetizers were barely there. You are literally paying for nothing. I ordered the Kobe beef strips and they were paper thin and tasted like they were from a cafeteria. Only the little salad on the side was good.   The dry aged steak tasted like something you would find in supermarket for $10.00 marked \"managers special\", Gristle included. I ate half and refused to finish it. It was undercooked. Just garbage. Total garbage.     Now onto the wine. The wines by the glass were at best average, and at worse, bland, tasteless and out of date. The price was inversely related. And the most expensive wine on the list tasted like something you would buy at a corner store for $5.00 in the bargain bin at 12:00am. It was absolutely tasteless,  bland. It was poor wine in addition to being possibly incorrectly stored with oxidization.     I politely noted to the waiter, who was rude the minute he came to the table, the  wine was tasteless and I would like to try something else. At that point his response should have been \"yes sir let me take that for you. What else would you like to try from our wine menu sir?\"  Instead he started arguing with me. Telling me I was mistaken about my taste in wine. I told him the wine tasted oxidized \"or something\" perhaps incorrectly stored. He then immediately lied claiming it was just opened.   I further informed him it tasted nothing like Cabernet Sauvingnon. He further disagreed with me essentially telling me I didn't know what I was talking about and refused to take the wine back to kitchen. He then said:   \"If you let the wine sit out on the table for a while in the glass it will bring out the flavor and it will taste good\"  This has got to be the most idiotic comment I have ever heard from anyone. Let alone a waiter at a five star steakhouse on the Las Vegas Strip.    Clearly this waiter has judged me as being too ignorant to know anything about the wine I'm drinking. At this point I informed him I have a 300 bottle wine cellar (wall shelf and Vino wine cooler)  in my residence (which is True).  I politely reiterated my opinion of this wine. He then reiterated his uninformed ignorant nonsense and waked away refusing to take the wine with him.    Other waiters had to come by and cover for him because he refused to come back. As a result they did not even bring basic things such as napkins, sauce, etc.   Not one to hold back my opinions I told the hostess and other women this place was overrated  and that the service, food and especially wine sucked. And I would strongly advise everyone reading this of the same.   Normally I don't waste my time writing reviews. I vote with my dollars and don't go back. I write this in the hopes the owner will read it and implement some changes to improve his steakhouse because as mentioned the environment, ambiance decor and proximity to Luxor is the only thing, in my opinion, that would make this place a good place to eat.",

We had a few apps and finished with bananas foster bread pudding, cheese cake with a chocolate ganache.   Service was notably great.  Both the front and back waiter were knowledgeable and attentive of the food and wine selection.  Since we all had food that would pair with different wines they suggested two bottles that had great drinkability with the food that we ordered.    I can't say enough about this restaurant.  Diamond in the rough is the best way to describe it.",

    "text": "This was a sensual delight! The chef's palate is similar to my own which is why I chose this restaurant. I often have trouble enjoying high-end restaurants due to my inability to find \"just the right thing\" on the menu to order. The chef has a lovely cheese course where you can order 3 or 5 cheeses from a delightful selection and it is paired with yummy bits such as raisin and sourdough breads, quince, dates, walnuts etc.   Next, there was a delightful list of entrees including what I came there for...steaks! I ordered the most expensive steak on the menu as a rare treat. (A5 Waygu Beef filet mignon) I was so excited! Unfortunately, the steak came overcooked. I ordered medium rare and it arrived medium and medium well on the ends. Bummer!   The waiter, Dewey, was prompt in asking me what I wanted him to do about it, although that made me uncomfortable. He did get the manager who offered to discount or to remake my order. I chose to take the unknown discount as I did not have time to deal with the re-do. This was not the best experience, but the steak was still yummy!  We also ordered sides of creamed corn and kale/broccoli rabe which were excellent in addition to a lovely bottle of Justin Cab well priced at $65. My boyfriend ordered a porterhouse steak which was prepared perfectly and the red wine sauce (ordered separately from a list of extras) was textbook perfection. We were full and were not tempted by dessert, but I wish that I had been as I am certain that it would have been excellent.  I would have no trouble recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for an \"old-school\" steakhouse experience. Most expecially, I would recommend Tender for anyone who enjoys being able to mix-and-match their own sauces, sides, etc. to create the best possible combination for their own palate.",

Bread should always be heated. We split the wedge salad and the bacon was very good but the rest was very ordinary. Since it sounded so large, my friend and I decided to split the 20 oz. boneless rib eye.  I was very surprised when it came out of the kitchen on one plate and we were expected to split it ourselves!! Seriously? The kitchen couldn't plate each of our meals? And it was just a steak on a plate with zero garnish....a tasty but very thin steak. It was perfectly medium rare. We also order potato wedges ($11) and got 3 WEDGES each!!! I don't think it equaled up to one whole potato--potatoes are cheap and that was all we got for $11? The grilled asparagus was limp and no grill marks or grilled flavor.  I don't mind paying top dollar when it is worth it but I certainly expect quality at those prices.",

    "text": "Typically Vegas! It tries to be a high end restaurant but doesn't follow the rules nor the etiquette of what one would expect in a fine dining establishment.  I would suggest table cloths and a dress code.  I didn't need to see all of the notches in the tables neither did I need to see young men dressed in Hurley t-shirts, plaid shorts, and flippy-floppys.  \"Dude, are you sure it's ok to eat steak, it hasn't been forty-five minutes since we've been out of the pool?\"  Oh the future of America,  sometimes I'm glad I'll be dead. Back to the restaurant. I ordered the wild game trio with a side of foie gras.  I received dry meat and no goose liver.  Oh well.  My partner had the bison ribeye and said that it was pretty good and well cooked.  Good for her, since we used her MyVegas points to get $75 off.  We also had the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese.  I thought they were ok, my partner gave them two thumbs up.  If she wasn't lying here next to me I'd tell her to get her own yelp account.  But she had the coupon and she also has the \"Hey-nanu-nanu\"  and if I want to keep dipping my meat into her sauce I'd best behave. Anyway back to the restaurant. We also had the soup trio: lobster bisque, onion and leek, and wagyu chili.  Chili was nice and spicy, the lobster bisque was more bisque than lobster, and the onion leek soup was not as smooth as anticipated.  We also had the short rib ravioli, they were good, but we just wished that they were warmer. For dessert we had the trio.  Chocolate cake (souffle), cheesecake, and creme brulee.  The creme brulee was excellent and came with a flaky buttery cookie that would make a Dane weep! My recommendation if you have a MyVegas coupon go and try it out.  I would suggest other options if one had to pay full price.",

Everyone in our party of 4 agreed we'd be back in a heartbeat if not for the music.  We spoke to the manager to let her know and also informed our great wait staff who agreed that if any music had to be playing, it should be classics and at low volume.  Amazing food - truly fantastic for everyone.  I loved the bison sampler and game-based deli meats for an appetizer.  There wasn't a single thing from the soup and salad starters to the gorgeous deserts that we wouldn't pay for again but none of us are willing to do it with that shitty cheesy music going in the background.  I really hope they listen to us.  I'm no big spender but would drop another 500+ for dinner for four if the ambience were fixed.   When we go back, we plan to walk in to check and if we hear that crappy sappy pseudo pop, we'll take our money elsewhere  It's really a shame because the food and service are fantastic!.",

For dessert we ordered the sampler of 4 different sorbet flavors. I believe they were red orange, mango, raspberry and a cinnamon pear? Whatever they were, they were delicious.   If you are staying at the Luxor, make your way down to Tender. And even if your not staying at the Luxor I do recommend you try it.",

When we were first seated, there was a very noisy, large party sitting near us.  We politely asked to be moved, and the servers immediately escorted us to a more quiet table.  Service, in general, was very good, with a team of two servers caring for an area.    Many steak choices, including kobe beef.  Also saw a wild game sampler.  Delicious bread and salads before our meal.  I ordered the lobster, and hubby ordered the filet and lobster.  We were both extremely happy with what we ordered.   To top it off, we had an amazing dessert that was plenty big for the two of us -- graham cracker crust, flourless chocolate cake, and marshmallow (yep, s'mores!), which was presented very well.",

    "text": "Mom, best friend and I were headed to see Carrot Top and in desperate need of some food. We were short on time, so we did not have the option to peruse the best of The Strip or even venture to Mandalay Bay. We had to take the best of what the Luxor could deliver. Mom was not in the mood for Mexican, so T&T was out, and Company Kitchen and Pub House was only serving a prix fixe menu on Sunday (weird). We landed at the bar at Tender noshing on salads, soups and some onion rings.   The $8 Garden Green was more affordable than some bar salads I have had, and it was nicely done with sundried tomatoes and artichoke. The tomato basil soup was a bit acidic, but I slurped it down. If I had been feeling better, I definitely think I could have gone to town on the onion rings with their splendid condiments: Scottish ale malt vinegar, tomato pear ketchup, and mustard aioli.  The service was solid, as everyone was courteous and quick, and given that the restaurant is ENORMOUS, it takes extra effort to be quick.   Maybe I am getting more Goth as I age, but I really enjoy the dark, mysterious vibe, and Tender does it up dark and toasty. Dark woods, black chairs, including a furry chair that I might be afraid to sit in but enjoyed looking at, lots of leather and heavy chandeliers. I was completely sold on the atmosphere; pre-show drinks here would definitely be comfortable. To top it all off, Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul was enjoying a steak at Tender before HE went to see Carrot Top. He seemed pretty happy when he left, so he must have liked the leather too.  The one shortcoming was the bread. I did not like it. It wasn't warm or crusty or tasty or anything, so that makes me a little tentative about what the rest of the menu might deliver. Still, I would definitely give it a second shot, and I would be happy to lounge in the bar any night (just don't make me sit in that furry chair).",

We were not going to dump our drinks out, so we just turned around, didn't acknowledge her and left! LITTLE BRAT!   We then decided to try Tender!

    "text": "Oh the Tender Steakhouse in the Luxor -- you had some promise.  Actually the place wasn't bad.  There were just some things that could have made it better.  Where to begin......OK, the food, that's always the most important in the end.  It was good.  The Salmon appetizer was terrific!!  You get Salmon three different ways.  The cold and hot were awesome.  The tartar was simply magnificent, and caviar, well it was my first try -- and I didn't mind it, and this is from a non-fish person.  Terrific way to start.  I had the 12oz Filet Mignon, and Heather had 1.25lb Maine Lobster, to go with a shared side of Scalloped Potatoes.  Here's where things started to fizzle a little.  My steak came out over cooked -- asked for medium, and got medium well teetering on well.  So that had to be sent back -- the second one was right on.  Cooked just right.  But not a lot of flavor, or seasoning.  Reason being is that they want you to try one of their six different accompaniments with it.  Which half way through the steak I had to.  I did the mushroom -- which was good.  Just didn't want to have to pay for a glaze to go with the steak.  While I enjoyed the bite Heather had me try of the Lobster, she didn't like that the lobster was already hanging in a sauce.  Which while she thought the sauce was not bad, she would have preferred to have a dipping choice.  She did like that they took the claws out of the shell when it got to her.    The Scalloped Potatoes were fantastic!!  Caught both of us off guard.  Really good.  Cocktails were pretty darn good.  I don't remember what Heather got, because I was all too consumed with my apple infused Woodford Reserve on the rocks.  Simply outstanding!  The decor and atmosphere were not bad.  Nothing that made it stand out good or bad from any other high-end steakhouse I'd been to.  Though when the the fire alarm went off for a good ten minutes, and there wasn't anything said, or condolences made, that was a little irritating to be kind.  Our waiter was OK.  He was nice enough, but wasn't around much.  Little disconcerting.  I will have to salute the Manager for coming by to give us a free dessert b/c of the steak temperature mishap.  Which was nice.  Pretty good place if you have a voucher like we did, and are staying in the Luxor.  However in the end, it wasn't good or bad -- it just was.",

I made reservations at TENDER to celebrate. The restaurant is located inside the casino.  Upon arriving, we were told to wait in the lounge for a few minutes and they'd call us when the table was ready. The lounge is an awesome place to have a pre-dinner cocktail. Mohagony or Brazilian Cherry wood floors and walls. Plush padded-leather chairs and sofas. We sat here for maybe 5 minutes before they showed us to our table. The dining area had a more elegant & upscale look to it. Just by the look, you can tell you're going to be dropping some serious cash.  I was trying to conserve my cash a bit for after-dinner activities (It is Vegas, afterall), so I ended up ordering the certified black angus beef flat iron steak and a side of baked macaroni & cheese. The steak was cooked to perfection! Flavorful, JUICY, lightly seasoned with just salt & pepper. And definitely TENDER. It nearly brought a tear to my eye. The mac & cheese was also VERY good. Torchio macaroni, smoked bacon, panko and white cheddar cheese. Definitely not my mom's mac & cheese. (No offense, mom)  The prices here are expensive. All good steakhouses are. And the portions will look a little on the \"smaller\" side. But I left the restaurant feeling stuffed and quite satisfied.  The service was also outstanding. The staff is friendly and courteous. Our drinks were constantly refilled. The whole place seemed to run like a well-oiled machine.  TENDER Steak & Seafood easily makes it into my list of \"Top Steak Restaurants\", and a MUST whenever I'm dining in town.  VIVA LAS VEGAS!",
