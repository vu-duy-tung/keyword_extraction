If  Garret is your server RUN!!!! He is the rudest waiter I have ever came across in these 34 years of my life. I never write reviews but I had to after coming to this place. McDonalds has better customer service! At least McDonald ask if there's anything else I would like! Garrett was just an a@$hole! He didn't even ask if my husband wanted something to drink and when my husband ask for a drink he just walked away in the middle of ordering and just brought our check!  I've tasted better sushi! This place isn't all that! Your better off getting some nachos upstairs. Remember if a big fat Japanese man named Garret comes your way, RUN!!",

For $17 one extra piece of Yellowtail, Salmon, Tuna would have been better (it came with 3 of each, 9 pieces total).  I don't recommend the calamari.   It's coated in something sweet and it's not very good in my opinion.  Service was fine,  in fact we received our sashimi before our salad and calamari which wasn't ideal but not a big deal.  I might go back just to satisfy my craving for sashimi but not as often as I would like due to the portion size for the cost.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here one night just to try out a different Japanese/Asian restaurant.  We were standing by the hostess waiting to be seated for about 15min with no one else in line but us, although we could understand that she was on the phone with another customer who had a lot of questions. Regardless, I wish the manager, who was walking around just asking people how their dinner is, could have given us any of the many tables that were available that night.  After we were seated, the server took about another 15-20min to get to us and said she thought our order was taken already. She was nice about it though but I still expected a little more than that. My husband had their beef teriyaki and I had a couple of their sushis.  His beef teriyaki was extremely disappointing as the beef seemed old and re-heated. It had an ok flavor to it but the quality of the meet was just terrible.  The two rolls I ordered were just ok and had too much rice packed into it. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Paying more than $70 for a meal that I would have quickly tossed in the trash was painful.  The one star I'm giving this restaurant is for our server who was kind enough to keep coming back to re-fill our hot tea. Other than that, I would never recommend anyone I know to this place to waste their money. There's a lot of other better Japanese restaurants in town.",

Not a busy crowd at that time and it's a pretty spacious restaurant so I'm liking it already. Right away I'm greeted by Leo who is by the way a genuinely very social person and good sushi chef. Whenever I look at the menu I'm never really sure what I want. So I'm always open to suggestions. And Leo made his right away! Most of the rolls were $3-$4 and they had some that were five or six.  I had their 777 roll, Salmon poke, fried oysters. $2 for Asahi beer! Pretty good rolls. I looked over their entire menu and they have a full selection and a few interesting menu items. Overall the service was very friendly. Most importantly though the service was very quick from Leo. Of course there weren't very many people in his section. But I don't know how many times I've sat down in a restaurant that didn't have a lot of people in there, yet the service seemed very slow. And sometimes when I'm dining alone I don't seem very talkative, but he got me to be social. He also let me know what was going on at the Southpoint and not just at Zenshin, such as the $5 movie specials at the movie theater. Great experience overall!",

Served with a light and tasty honey mustard sauce that compliments the eggplant wonderfully. We were both somewhat disappointed in the two different bowls we ordered. I chose the pork and my wife one of the chicken bowls. They were both \"ok\", nothing special. The protein was tasty but the onions on a bed of white rice didn't add much flavor. The service was decent. Especially liked how the servers would keep refilling our water. I would give this establishment another chance and order something different.",

I had already bookmarked the restaurant on Yelp as a place to try and I noticed it was happy hour (2pm to 6pm daily), so I figured I was meant to eat here.  The decor was Asian inspired and everything looked clean and organized.   The hostess led me to the bar and offered me the happy hour menus. For drinks, I ordered a water and a strawberry bangkok (strawberry colada - patron silver, malibu coconut, fresh sweet n sour, fresh muddled strawberries with a thai chili pepper inside) which were brought out to me quickly. The sushi chef behind the counter took my order of teriyaki beef slider (thinly sliced beef, asian slaw & spicy miso sauce), hoisin pork belly with bao buns (pickled vegetables, green onions & cilantro), and a crunch roll (shrimp tempura, crab, avocado roll, topped with crunchies & eel sauce).  I enjoyed the strawberry bangkok drink and the crunch sushi roll was delicious. I had to force myself to slow down and not inhale the roll. I enjoyed the teriyaki beef slider more than the bao buns. The bao buns weren't terrible at all, they were okay. Just not my style.  Both the food and service during happy hour were a joy to me, especially after the terrible happy hour I received at another place, so I definitely want to come back to Zenshin. Heck, I even want to come back here when it's not happy hour, that's how much I liked it.",

Saw it come out and sit at the counter for 7 minutes before walking over and asking for the Mgr. All Keani had to do was offer us a seat inside or at least call us over when the food was ready for pick up but NOPE, instead she let our food sit on the counter and DIDN'T call us over from the slot machines we were sitting at in front of the resturant (we don't gamble) we just sat there looking over and even getting eye contact with the girls at the counter. Mike the Mgr handled it well, offered us a seat INSIDE and had a new order of tempura cooked up.i sure hope Mike changes the way people get treated here. We were dressed pretty casual but no reason to treat us like that. California rolls, spicy salmon rolls and tempura was very tasty and what we expected the quality to be like. 2 Stars for the good food, 1/2 Star (if I could for MIke making it right). I'll shoot Steven an email and see what comes of it.  Updated review, Mike, Steve and Terrance are excellent examples of Business leaders that take pride in customer service. We will be back to Zenshin for the great food & customer service.",

Service was very fast and the waiter was really friendly!  The ramen smelled delicious when. He brought it out. However I found the broth to be a bit too salty. There were thick cuts of meat and the ramen noodles were pretty thick too. It was good but not the best. If it was less salty I would have enjoyed it more.   I also got a taste of the spicy tuna bowl and wish I had got that instead! It was a pretty big bowl too!   Overall I had a good experience here and will probably come back when it's happy hour :)",

A bit too much garlic on the chili garlic edamame, but that was good as well.  The restaurant is a lot larger than it looks from the outside and is really nice inside. It looks like they have a private room.   Would definitely recommend!",

    "text": "I'm basing this review on the happy hour menu. We had a team outing here last night and decided to check this place out. We hadn't initially anticipated doing happy hour, but since we got here before the 6pm cutoff, we decided to order a majority of our meal off the menu. They have plenty of appetizers, drinks and rolls for $5 or less on the menu. We ordered a number of different things to share. I started with a Strawberry Bangkok to drink. It was pretty refreshing, nothing amazing, but good for the price. Here is a rundown of what we ate.   Hamachi kama - Not the best yellowtail collar I've ever had, but it was a nice size portion and at only $5 I can't complain.   Shishito peppers - A little oversauced, but the flavor was nice nonetheless.   Candy cane roll - My favorite of the night. Flavorful and refreshing. I'd definitely order this again, despite it not being on the happy hour menu.   777 roll - Not a fan, despite the $5 pricetag. The flavors were just off and I probably wouldn't order it again.   Squid legs - Chewy and overcooked. Really not a fan, wouldn't recommend.   Salmon poke - This dish was just ok, although there was a little too much sauce and it was a little vinegary.   Eggplant fries - Second favorite dish of the night. I'm not really a fan of deep-fried food but this was light for fries. The eggplant was really tasty and well-seasoned. Skip the mayonnaise dipping sauce it's served with. It was not good.   We tried a few desserts as well. No standouts, but mochi is always a safe bet.   This was a 3 1/2 star experience rounded up for their happy hour value. Most of the food quality was just ok and I don't think I'd be too interested in paying full price for most of the items. Definitely a great value and worth a visit for happy hour. They accommodated our large party quite well and service was good until the end when it was time to order dessert and we couldn't find our waitress for a while.",

Upon request, they served us both the Miso Soup and the Salad for starters.  I had the Lobster Tempura for my entree and the Young Coconut Bread Pudding for dessert.  Although I really could not taste the lobster, I thought the presentation was good and the portion was generous.  I thought it would have been better if the batter were not so thick.  The Bread Pudding was more like a hard cake cut into squares, I thought it was just okay.  I tasted the mackerel entree that my friend ordered, this was a simple dish, ample serving, and well prepared!  I also tasted the Banana Foster Lumpia, very creative and yummy!  The service was attentive and responsive to our requests. I would come back here and bring more friends!",

    "text": "This dining Experience took place last night after 10 PM on 6/14/2014  As a food lover, I enjoy most foods out there.  Sometimes the food can be good to fantastic, but the service is not the best.  When a mismatch like this happens,  I really have to write about it.    My friends an I came to the Southpoint Hotel for a Health Convention, we decided that we should come here, since we were here last time and the Chicken Curry Katsu was pretty good.  So we came, had to wait 20 minutes because there were a lot of people.  So we thought wow, must be pretty good like last year.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  The 6 of us, missing 1 because he was busy winning at the slot machine, looked over the menu and decided we were going to eat light tonight.  Good thing for Happy Hour.  I ordered a Spider Roll and 777 Roll, my friends ordered a Beef Teriyaki, Chicken Katsu Curry and Beef Fried Noodles \"Japanese Style\" w/ Fried Egg.  For me the rolls were excellent in both taste, texture and presentation.  I would give it a 4/5 for the rolls.  My other friend who got her Fried Noodles was not impressed at all.  The fried egg was a sad looking overcooked, extra oily flat ovoid, that was begging to be part of a high school cafeteria unhealthy meal.  This was sitting on top of oily thick egg noodles and thinly sliced beef that was overly marinated with sauce.  To make a long story short she could not stomach it and had to bring it home.  The other 2 friends were way too tired and hungry to care much about the food.  After, finishing, or not wanting to finish the food, we waited for the wait staff to return.  Thinking that it would not take long for the pricing and atmosphere, we were sadly mistaken.  At 20 minutes of wait time, I tried to wave somebody down to get the check, but he said that our waiter will be with us.  After waiting another 10 minutes and my friends asking how come we can't get a waiter,  I decided that I needed to be proactive.  Going to the front, explaining how long we have been waiting, the ladies, said they will look for our waiter.  One came back with the printed check.  The worst part of this communication transaction, was that they did not even apologize have out waiter come to give us the check and apologize for the long wait.  Bad customer service trickles down from the top.  I have been at less attractive meal locations and had the best customer service, to a mediocre meal.  After paying our meal in cash, so we can hit our beds quicker,  we realized something.  They totally forgot the Miso soup that  was suppose to come with the Beef Teriyaki and the Chicken Curry Katsu.  This prompted me to write this review.  I can only say this, like the shadow economy the past year, along with oil,  Service has gone down, way down.  If you are desperate and don't mind to wait and waste your sleep time, by all means this is perfect for you.  If not, invest your time and dining experience elsewhere.  The Customer Service is a 1.5/5.  If you need recommendations for food in Vegas let me know,  I can help.  There is life after bad service.  Take care.",

    "text": "Cool modern place.  The sushi was above average and very fresh and can stand on its own.  Fresh.  If I couldn't tell by the taste, I seen them wheeling it in air tight bags on ice during lunch.  I think the strengths that put this place over the top are the non-sushi items:  The black cod was crispy, flaked off the fork, was not dry at all.  In fact it is very succulent with zero \"fish\" taste.  Pork belly was totally fantastic.  Just get it is all I can say--find room for it, share it, whatever...  just try it.  The servers are good and an enjoyable bunch.  They definitely know their menu if you are not sure about something and are having trouble deciding.  They will tell you details and have had stuff on the menu themselves.  I am no paid food critic--but I am not some schlub who stuffs his gullet and has no concept of what is going on.  I'm pretty surprised with 1-3 star reviews but notice they tend to be closer to when the place opened so maybe the restaurant was working through some things at their opening.",

    "text": "I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this place, but the truth is that good sushi isn't exactly scarce here, so you'll need a few other points of pride if you want to do well.    We've been twice.  The first time was right after they opened.  We approached the hostess stand to the right (if you're standing in front of the restaurant) and the girl snarled, \"You need to put your names in over there,\" pointing to the other hostess stand to the left (basically just a counter where menus were spread out).  Okay.  Our visit that time was unremarkable - nice waiter, good food, really dead for a place that just opened.  It was the second visit this weekend that solidified my opinion.  Wouldn't ya know, we approached the \"correct\" counter this time and stood there waiting.  And waiting.  And... waiting.  A hostess approached... no, she diverted to the right-hand stand and began counting out her drawer.  After a couple minutes I cleared my throat, she looked up and said, \"Um, are you dining in?\"  I said, \"Yes, we were hoping to, but we've been standing here for almost ten minutes.\"  Not even the grace for a perfunctory apology, she grabbed two menus and stalked into the restaurant.  I assumed we were meant to follow her, so we did.  Big mistake!  We ordered two apps (garlic edamame and eggplant fries, both good) and three rolls (two of which were very good).  I don't know what to say about the third roll, a baked roll, because it never came.  We waited and waited... our waitress disappeared.  She finally showed up and we asked for the check, which of course, included the missing roll.  We explained that we didn't receive it and asked her to take it off the check.  She was embarrassed, very nice, about it, but explained that \"the first one got burned and they are trying to make you another one.\"  Really, 30 minutes after our food came out?  And no one was going to tell us unless we asked?  There were literally three other occupied tables in the restaurant.  The bartender was eating a pretzel.  It's not like it was too busy to handle the Saga of the Burned Roll.  Needless to say we will not be back.",

    "text": "This place was never that great when it was first opened, but the service was great then.  Now it got worse!  I went there by myself this one night, this hostess refused to seat me...she asked me to rather sit at the counter, or to just stand there to wait while there were many empty tables available.  I asked her about those tables, she told me they were reserved, which was a lied.  Because no ones ever came in for it.  Then this waitress named 'Jane', the biggest rude air head I have ever seen.  And here's come this food runner, absolutely rude, rude, rude.  'Rude' is probably his last name.  I believe those people have never received any kind of training before working there.  Although these two managers were running around the whole place acted like they were real busy.  But then again, if they were doing such a good job/management, why would the place be so bad?  The sushi were not fresh, they should not be serving it at all.  I am the kind of person who look for quality, especially when it comes to sushi.  The only good food in here was this 'Eggplant Fries', and that's about it.     Overall, it was just a horrible experience!  And Warming...DO NOT go there to eat by yourself!  Singles are not welcome there.  They do discriminate against single customers.  I've read one of the man who wrote a review about this place earlier, and he also noticed about the similar issue.  Wow...isn't that a shame!",

    "text": "Really enjoyed my meal here with Anthony and Sarah-Marie. We try to fit a \"sibling\" meal in at least monthly to catch up; trying out the latest spot @ South Point was a great idea. I'm trying desperately here not to hold it up against my favorite neighborhood Sushi-Ya, because it is a fusion/Hawai'i style location. Never having been to Island Sushi put me at a loss as to what to expect.   Speaking of lost, holy heck, this place might as well be in CA. The car park was INSANE. I was cursing like a sailor on the phone with SM trying to find a spot for 15+ minutes. Do yourself a favor & go to Self Park.   Normally, I'd be sitting at the sushi bar, but SM & Anthony procured a table in dining room to right. Kind of glad because the sushi bar area was open to Casino and it was packed Friday night. It is brand spanking new, which showed in decor and some service hiccups (they ran out of menus? So our server had to take away the one we wanted to keep: no biggie, but since we order family style, we might have ordered more with a chance to really peruse it as we munched and gabbed)  We had the Eggplant \"fries\" deceptively light for a deep fried item and the batter was airy, like tempura. We also shared the Ahi Poke Tacos (x2 orders) which were very good, with high quality tuna, guacamole and creme fraiche. The Hamachi Sashimi with jalapeno over truffle oil & yuzu was indulgent. We turned at least 4 over zealous bussers away because we wanted to keep that oil for the House Sashimi Sampler and the Salmon Carpaccio. I did not taste the Dynamite Mussels, but I'm picky about mussels. The fish was fresh enough, cut and presented well. It just wasn't that \"flown in last night, killed in front of you\" quality I've become accustomed to. We all really enjoyed the salmon skin salad: on a bed of super fresh micro greens with a light delicious dressing. The only ding was that the slices of salmon skin were very inconsistent in their cuts, with most being on the thin side.   There were choices for any palate on the menu, so carnivores, ramen lovers, local Ono style and bowl folks alike should walk away satisfied. My Belvedere with a side of soda (I'm super picky and usually mix it myself: former bartender problems) was only $6. You read that right. So clearly, marking up premium vodka is not an issue here!   In all, this is a great spot to grab \"Asian\" food in this part of town. On a funny note: I was lost and asked SP employee where the new restaurant was and rolled my eyes when she said \"Oh, the Asian place...\" and very kindly pointed me there. Then I walk up and see a giant honking sign proclaiming \"Asian Restaurant\" so I was getting all non politically correct riled up over nada. 3.5 stars rounded up because it shows promise. And ALL of these delicious dishes were just 30$ each+ tip (split 3 ways which is our style) extremely affordable!   ***see pics from SM & Anthony, I ate ;)) ***  Yelp 100 Challenge",

I was hesitant about the shisito peppers cause they were a bit simple, but that was all it needed to be.  The plates were cleared out along with the savory BBQ pork belly and fresh oysters.  The appetizers where a great start especially if its something you just want to nibble on with a drink on the side.  I've been getting into trying new brews lately and the server was very knowledgeable and introduced me to a great beer line up.  Most memorable one was KOSHIHIKARI ECHIGO.  I had to make a side note just so I can find this beer again cause there was no way I could have made up an acronym to remember that.  My friend gave the perfect description feeling of a geisha underneath a waterfall...refreshing and you can't help but say ah!  JALAPENO YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI!! Enough said I savored every slice! Totally fit with the one commercial, \"When you really like something, you just want more. You want MORE!\"   Definitely my favorite next to the dessert!    Thank goodness I still had some room for the mini malassadas! They were a warm delight with the dipping sauce finished the meal with perfect bang of satisfaction!    Definitely need to take advantage of their happy hour on my next visit!!",

The food is amazing, fabulous, delicious, yummy etc. etc. etc.  We had the California Roll, Crunchy Crab Roll, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Spring Rolls, and something new that is a Crab Roll and it is fried and wrapped in green soy paper.  It was amazing, and so beautifully presented.  We went during their late Happy Hour and the service and the food was outstanding, and lets not forget Steve the GM who is such a delightful person and always stops by the table to say Hello.  If you want delicious sushi, served beautifully, and great service this is the place to dine.  The staff are attentive, actually its like a family, everyone helps and makes sure the water glasses are filled, removes the empty plates and the waitress is always checking back to see how you are doing.

They then say it's because it is an item on the regular menu.  No sign explains that but the menu the point out say 3.00 upcharge.  When I stated that it's not on the sign all five girls and the manager chime in to say it's in the fine writing on the menu in front of group of people.  They are calling me out over their False advertising. But not the 80% upcharge. No, I'm sorry for the confusion.  Maybe there's other up charges they are not telling people about.  Too bad I'm sure there's a lot of people in the hotel who would visit.  Maybe an upcharge for a clean table.  Who knows.  I had invited Japanese wife to eat and she eats alot of sushi.  It's right next to the poker room where 200 people sit and would like to eat healthy food all day long.  But not at $13 a roll.  I ordered  chicken wrap I was going to order 3 things.

    "text": "This place was the last stop of the day. Had some grear other grub but had to take the babies out for a little thank you for being so good. This place was conveniently located across from out resort and the fact that it was happy hour was the kicker.  Now, contextually, you'll have to understand that this restaurant is in a casino/resort that hosts alot of rodeos and things of that nature, so, I'm not sure they are going for completely authentic sushi, or sashimi. I'm guess they are going for a wider or broader audience so tje have diluted it, alot. But, I digress.  Obviously, the food was just okay. We ordered a bunch of stuff off the happy hour menu and the lunch menu which lasts until late afternoon. The best items were the pork skewers which were very very chewy, think I'm still chewing it a day later.  The crunchy shrimp roll was really crunchy, I think, due to maybe shells being in there was my guess. The oxtail tostadas were disappointing, didn't taste like oxtails though, and the seasoning was questionable. The waygu burger BG  ordered was killed by the kitchen, totally overcooked. And, it didn't really have much flavor which makes me sad because it's waygu??? The best thing we are I think we're the eggplant fries which were good once we put some salt on them.   Overall, I would take the kids back here if they wanted to go and it was convenient but other than that, not so much...",

My mom and I ordered the Edamame, Hamachi Kama, Spring Rolls, and Lettuce Wraps. Everything was good while I am not used to eating the collar of the Hamachi so I probably wouldn't buy it again. However, I suppose it is normal to not expect much from HH as the portions are small. They weren't bite sized but small enough to force you to order a lot or leave not quite full. The sushi looked good and I regret not ordering that. But for those seeking a satisfying Happy Hour, I recommend you look elsewhere.",

We had such an awesome server named Mochi and she sat us around 8:30pm. We ordered calamari and 4 shrimp tempura for starters. Then when 9 o'clock hit Mochi gave us the happy hour menu and we ordered one of EVERYTHING on the top. The garden pizza was demolished mostly by me with sriracha on the side. I didn't really dig the fried oysters just because Im used to eating them raw. Besides water our table had 2 merlots, a beer & a martini throughout our meal and ended with 4 green tea ice creams for dessert. We went over our voucher budget by ~$40 lol This place wasnt hard to find being located towards the back with a huge sign readig Zenshin. I love how the sushi chefs were always yelling their usual Irasshaimase greeting whenever a guest entered.",

The staff were very polite and friendly. Honestly after a canceled flight and transferring hotels I was starving. I was looking forward to the pork Belly buns that were pictured here on Yelp but unfortunately are no longer on the menu and have been replaced with hotdogs? Considering that they actually have a hot dog stand in the hotel casino I thought this was bad move, but I'm just a foodie passing through :)  However they do serve sushi! I decided to get two rolls one being the spicy tuna roll and unfortunately I can't recall the other roll, they were ok, nothing special but price appropriate. I also got a bowl of ramen which tasted like it was from the package. This particular bowl had pork Belly and hard boiled egg in it however it tasted old and the bowl overall just kinda bland. The atmosphere was nice, they played great music and I left with a full tummy. All in all I give a 3.",

I am used to paying almost twice as much for 3. The poke was fresh and the toppings and won-ton shell were perfect.   Bad: I LOVE shrimp tempura so I ordered the bowl with onions. The batter they use is very thick  and the shrimp was small. I like tempura done very light and crunchy, this was more heavy and oily. I didn't finish any of it after the first one.  I didn't get to try the sashimi, but I wish I had ordered that instead of the tempura. The creme brulee is really good here as well. I would return just for the poke tacos and to try the oxtail soup.",

I wish the happy hour portions were a little bit bigger for their prices, but other than that, I have no major complaints!  - Come hungry, because the dinner portions were huge! My fiance and I shared every dish in my photos, and we were stuffed!  - If you like sweet and subtle fruity drinks, I recommend the sake sangria! It's not currently on their menu, because they're in the process of creating a new drink menu. However, if you ask for it, I'm sure they'll be able to make it for you!   Environment: 5/5  - I really like the convenient outlets on the booths and by the bar.  - The environment was nice and classy. Perfect for happy hour, date night, or a family dinner.",

Ok during lunch was fantastic guess because it was slow but dinner time different story. I got a nice quiet booth in the corner  and we ordered  calamari apatizer  which is served with a nice aoli sauce. Mine was braised beef very tender but a bit on the small side for basically crock pot beef with bone. Served  with a fried rice that was done with flair well plated and good presentation. Our waitress was very nice but hostess  seated rowdy  people next to us.  No sense same age demographic should be seated near each other Lisa let us move, which helped but the bus boy kept pestering for my plates guess wanted us out. Ok so quality fantastic value not so much, seats and ambiance varies 3 our of 5 people were great hostess and busboy as I mentioned weren't",

After placing our order it took about 20 minutes for food to begin to arrive.  The California rolls arrived first and D said they were really good. About 5 minutes later a soup and a salad arrived and they were basic. About 10 minutes later everything else arrived.  About 10 minutes later a dinner salad arrived.    Most had teriyaki, chicken rice bowls that were fine not great.  While we were waiting 20 minutes for the check and discussing how average the food was and how untimely the service was someone from the kitchen brought another dinner salad after we had finished dinner.

The name you would never know but they do tell you on the menu the Chef same guy. I always been fan of Island Sushi. I been too both locations one on eastern and downtown. One thing diversifies this location is much more upscale feel too it. The sushi bar area is easily biggest one of the three. It has very modern current look too it. Overall never know upscale because the prices are very reasonable most of the items are under $10. There is no real dress code seen braddahs going casual shorts and tank top action. The portion sizes are good size goes along with the local style food. It just opened so you could tell that the wait staff still working out the kinks. Overall say the service was great! Some of the sushi took little longer but still got everything that we order.   The food I ordered the torq fever sushi roll (spicy tuna roll) the presentation was beautiful. The taste was solid spicy tuna roll. I had the tonkatsu ramen. I know why ordering ramen if not the big three. I was in the mood for ramen. It was another solid dish. The broth was Ono! It was filling with all the toppings. Lucky enough that got too try some of my friends dishes. I tried the gyoza, softshell crab, sashimi platter, and eggplant fries. All tasty stuff. The presentations on all the food was really nice definitely for the price thinking something off. It all on point.   It great addition too South Point Hotel. Hotel that always felt lacking in diversity comes too restaurants. Zenshin not only great sushi and local food. Another part of Vegas and find some comfort local food 808 style!!!! Sure I plan on going back if ever in the area need too get my local food! =)))))",

The meat on my Korean BBQ short ribs was so tough I couldn't eat it with anything but my bare hands. My fiances ribs tasted a few days old and were still cold. Don't even bother the waiter who couldn't take time to check on the patrons. Now for high prices and small portions you should expect quality. Not what we received. The best part was the drinks which numbed the pain of feeling ripped off. Sixty dollar one course meal...",

I ordered the crunch roll with soy paper (it was very good!) but the 777 on the happy hour menu was strange. It said topped with spicy tuna but what came out wasn't just spicy tuna. My server explained they blend the tuna with something to make it spicy. But the result was this strange creamy, fishy paste on top. Not what I was expecting. I'll definitely be back here again though. Nice place, nice service and great prices. I will avoid the 777 in the future, however, and any other roll topped with \"spicy tuna\".",

Misoyaki black cod: - This was my favorite dish! The fish was soooo delicious and the sauce was fantastic! It was served with bok choy and rice. I would definitely go back for this alone!  777 roll: - I was weary about ordering anything with soft shell crab because I had never had it before but it was soooo good!   Spicy tuna roll: - A classic staple. Always good. :)  Len Ying drink: (I think that was what it was called) - Really interesting. It is a hibiscus flavored drink that was recommended by our bartender. Never had anything like it!  Strawberry cocktail of some sort: - Also really interesting. Very very tasty! I was skeptical because it had muddled fresh strawberries and a thai chili inside but it ended up being so good!  Green tea tiramisu: - A nice light dessert after a big meal. :)   Mini malasadas:  - Served with a dollop of custard and chocolate, it was the perfect dessert to share along with the green tea tiramisu.   The owners did Zenshin right. Food and service was amazing! We especially enjoyed the company of Katie, our bartender/server. She was very personable and accommodating. When in Vegas, I would definitely go again!  P.S. They are located in the back left corner of South Pointe Hotel and Casino.",

    "text": "It is difficult to give a full detailed review of Zenshin since all I ordered last night was an appetizer and a beer but I can tell you a story of that much.   It all started when I won tickets to a screening of Last Jedi from my bank. It happened to be booked for the theatre at the South Point so I came in from work and prepared to get my nerd on. I had some time to kill before the show so I walked around the casino looking for food. The National Finals Rodeo was in town and the South Point was the place to be for all the cowboys. With all those cowboys over running the casino, most every dining option was packed. But not Zenshin. There were pleanty of open tables and no line. Plus they have happy hour specials from 2:00 to 6:00 PM daily and it was now only 5:00. Since I was a party of one, I was seated immediately at the bar.   I already knew what I wanted to order having looked through the menu outside. I asked for a Sapporo beer ($4.50) and an order of the chicken lettuce wraps ($5.00). My beer was up within a couple of minutes and was simply a nicely poured lager. Refreshing but nothing spectacular. My lettuce wraps came out just a couple of minutes after the beer. There were three pieces of bib lettuce on the plate each with its own small fill of ground chicken and mushrooms. I could smell the mushrooms above all else. Fine by me as a mushroom fanatic. There was also a small bowl of thick sauce which I spooned over the chicken. Each wrap lasted about three bites.  Not huge portions but it was just an appetizer. Despite the small size they had big flavor. A punch of salt from the sauce. Earthiness from the mushrooms. A hint of spice. It was perfect to get me through the movie.   At $5 for this app, I am not upset. But I would never pay full price for it, whatever full price is. And the beer at $4.50 was high too. Especially for a happy hour pint. Though I guess it was technically an import. All in all, the beer was cold and the food hot. Service was friendly and the cowboys were not (just kidding guys). And everything came to my table fast.   Historically I don't really come to the South Point more than once a decade so I probably wont be stopping back by Zenshin. If by chance I should I find myself back here, I'd be happy to give it another go.",

One customer walked in while we were still waiting and seated himself at the sushi bar, without being told to wait.   We start to think it's discrimination.

Their sushi is always on point and the dessert is beyond delicious. We came by yesterday and the servers were all friendly as we remember and we never had to ask for a refill. We also tried their spicy Garlic Edamame for the first time which was amazing! I am however sad to hear they have removed the pineapple cake and ice cream from their menu...it was one of the reason why we have returned so many times. We were lucky enough to order it yesterday but was informed it may not be available again moving forward. Either way, we will definitely give them another visit for happy hour before we head back to San Diego.",

What made tonight's visit so terribly bad was the Zenshin manager and his 2 hosts wouldn't allow My brother-in-law in to the restaurant with his seeing eye dog. I guess he doesn't look \"blind enough\" walking around with his new pup- who was wearing a fully labeled GUIDE DOG harness!   The manager asked for my brother's \"blind\" credentials and after reviewing his IDs insisted casino security come and verify his dog was a service dog and give her a pink tag. The manager said it was part of SouthPoint's new policy. What made it worse is the security guard came and kept asking \"what's the dog for? What's the service?\" To which we all had to reply \"He's BLIND!\"   The cherry on top was the service was terrible and they didn't even offer to comp my brother a drink, appetizer or dessert for the inconvenience, embarrassment or harassment!! Seriously?!   Shame on Southpoint for being so ignorant of ADA rights and for being blind towards a blind man! Apparently, their \"new policies\" include discrimination towards the blind.   While the food is great, that kind of \"service\" is not acceptable! Mom and I will be looking for a new place for dinner from now on!",

I asked what was not on the main menu and she said one item.  so I was going to pay  5 for one item upcharge?.  I think the lady was making up new rules as she wanted.   anyways 52 dollars later I had a lunch.  wont eat there again im afraid they will charge a dish fee.  not sure what happy hour is for but I thought it was to get business on the slow times?",

I know I know I ordered ice cream to go at a restaurant but in my defense I stayed in hotel vicinity. We ordered and they gave it a 15 minute wait. Now my common sense tells me u bring it out of the freezer or prep it at that 12-15 min mark but anyways, we showed up waited just a minute to get helped, the hostess told us our food would be just a few minutes. No problem u guys are busy we can see BUT as time went we noticed there was a box of food behind the counter and we got to thinking I wonder if it is ours. Sure enough it was and she had no idea. Then she checked the bag told us I have to get your dessert excuse me. We waited as she asked around, my coworker says I bet $20 it was in the bag the whole time. Well I'm glad I didn't shake on it. It was in the bag and not only in the bag but the first thing placed in the bag. Sooooo not only did u not communicate about our food but u put ICE CREAM at the bottom of a hot food bag... Who does that. I called and got a refund and they were very accommodating asking if I wanted a new dessert I declined but was happy with their accommodations. All my coworkers love it there and we're pleased with their meals.",

The Standouts:    Dynamite mussels - two savory morsels in every half shell.  So good. Fried Calamari - crispy fried on the outside, tender on the inside.  Comes with a nice sweet mayo sauce which gives you a great sweet/salty combo. Mini Tuna Tacos - so fresh, with a little spicy bite from the wasabi guacamole. Pork Belly - honorable mention.  Very tasty with the little white buns.  Happy Hour prices are great for the above apps.",

Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing (the happy hour deals are the best in town) but the service was phenomenal. Christina was our server but she had a whole team buzzing about, constantly bussing our table and giving refills. I don't know if either of our drinks ever got lower than halfway gone and they sprinted (no, literally, they ran from table to table) to refill them.   The food was great. The pork tonkatsu was tender and crispy. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough of the delicious katsu sauce for the portion size. My wife got two of the happy hour rolls-- the 007 and the Crispy Roll. They were only $5 a piece, but were huge. 8 pieces per roll and very flavorful. All-in-all, it was one of the best all-around dining experiences I've ever had.",

I wish they did a bowl with half poke and half spicy tuna.   Tonkatsu ramen was also good. The broth wasn't salty. I would not order the udon at this place. It looked and taste like the udon packet we buy at an asian store.  I would have given this place a 5 star if it wasn't for one of their employee.   The girl at the reception desk was the rudest person my group had to deal with. If you do not like you job, don't take it out on your customers.   We had a group of 8 and when we got there, there were plenty of seats open. We asked the girl to put out name down and she said its a 20 minute wait. We ask if we could sit separate to make it easier and faster to be seat and all she said was give me a minute and rolled her eyes at us. We waited 15 minute and asked her how much longer do we have to wait and she would not reply. A group of 7 people came and she sat them right away. We asked she why we can't get seated when half the restaurant was free and she said they have a list of people waiting before us. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE! This girl said we can't get seated because the other people are not there yet for their dinner reservations. Ten minute later and yet no one else showed up. We finally got seated after another girl came to take over the position.  Horrible hosted! Other then her, our waiter was great and very informative!",

Our party of eight was whisked away to a huge round table the back where we thought we would get subpar service... That was not the case. The whole night the service was second to none. We started with drinks and right after those arrived our server asked if we would like appetizers.  We started with the classic salted edamame, then garlic chicken, and gyoza. The garlic chicken was fantastic, so much so we ordered an extra one as we were licking our finger & chopstick.  I WANT THAT SAUCE!!!!!  It was sweet & garlicky & mildly firery and so much like a crack substitute I am shocked there are not addicts waiting outside the place.  The gyoza was perfect, crisp yet tender & not slimy inside.    For our main dishes, we were under time constraints so we opted for entrees meals which included soup & salad.  The miso soup while slightly salty for my taste was perfectly presented otherwise as was the simple salad that had such depth of flavor from the ginger vinaigrette that I could have just had a big bowl of that salad & been happy!  I ordered the tonkatsu which was served in a huge portion, was perfectly fried crisp yet Tender inside. It was served on a bed of shredded cabbage with tomatoes on the side a wedge of lemon which I did not use, and a side of Ponzu sauce.  Others in my party ordered the chicken teriyaki, glazed I a deliciously sweet & sour sauce cooked perfectly to a juicy and tender perfection, chicken katsu, Also tried to crispy tender perfection and one of the teens ordered a beef noodle bowl, full of tender moist noodle sans soup which was served in a bowl almost as big as her head!  There was a few more that I wist I had wrote down but all tasted great (we stared tastes).  Zenshin was a surprise find at the South Point Casino (my guests were staying next door at a timeshere & I was at SP) considering one of the guests wanted to go for Chinese takeout. Instead we found a fantastic place to sit down and enjoy even with the time constraints we had.  It's now a must eat every time we come to Vegas.  It's that good!  Great portion sizes.  Killer Service!!!!    Garlic chicken on the appetizer menu...GET IT!!!!! Bring mints!!!!  4.5 overall",

The happy hour is the best and the drinks are delicious. I love the lychee martini. Such a great taste all around from the food and the drinks. We like reserving a table during happy hour so that we are seated once we get there. The vibe is peaceful and the playlists are great! I love it here and I recommend everyone to try for the best fresh sushi! The miso salmon is to die for also!",

Only thing tho the rice wasn't really fresh. Rice kernel should be whole and chewy. The sushi rice had been marinated for awhile where it started to break down and lost its chewiness. It was still good though. Service was great, nice people, and I was full, which is rare with vegan diet but I left satisfied with the portions per $$.  We will be back for sure!",

    "text": "First time coming here today from my cousin's recommendation and I was extremely disappointed. My cousins, brother and I were craving some sushi and ramen. My cousins told me this place was really good.  We walked in about 4 in the afternoon. We waited about 5 minutes, not too bad of a wait. As we sat down, our server got us our drinks quickly and was able to take our order immediately. My cousins ordered about 4 or 5 stuff and then my brother and I ordered: miso ramen, teriyaki pizza, crunch roll, takoyaki and a salmon nigiri.  All of my cousins order came out first and then later my brothers teriyaki pizza came out and then my miso ramen. We were still waiting on the salmon nigiri, takoyaki, and crunch roll.  After about 10 minutes, my cousin ordered another crunch roll because he thought it would take awhile since our order was. 5 minutes after he ordered, his crunch roll came out. We started getting very impatient, especially due to the fact almost 30 minutes has passed and we didn't get our items from our original order. It was also very aggravating that our waitress never came to see if we got all our food or to see if we were okay.  We flagged down the guy wearing a suit who we assumed is a manager. We told him we haven't gotten our full order so he told us he would go in the back and check it. Few minutes later, he said that the takoyaki and salmon were taking too long because they were doing some \"preparations\" for it and it would take about 10 to 15 minutes. Okay... so in total it would take almost 40 minutes to due prep for takoyaki and salmon nigiri??? If that was the case, why didn't our waitress say that there would be a wait so we can order something else? ALSO what preparation takes 40 minutes for salmon nigiri? Honestly think the guy was making excuses. He didn't even mention an excuse for the roll we were missing.   Later on, our roll FINALLY came out. And the man we spoke with said that they made the salmon nigiri for me. What happened to the 10 to 15 minute prep???  The guy told us that he didnt charge for the salmon nigiri. I honestly did not care that he did but okay sure I appreciated a little bit. It amused me that our waitress never came back to even apologize to us for the inconvience or even checked to see if we needed anything else or hot tea. When we asked for our checks, she just handed it to us and walked away. No \"sorry for the wait\" or even a \"thank you.\" Okay.. What kind of service is this? I was okay after we got some of our food even though it was VERY late. But then even as we are about to leave, our server didn't care for us at all. That triggered me really hard.  This was the most unpleasant experience I've ever had. I wanted a nice lunch before I went to work but ended up in disappointment. I do know the name of our server and the manager, but I would not rather call them out.   Also, out of everything I ordered, the crunch roll was the best. I give them the 1/2 a star for the crunch roll and 1/2 a star for the guy who somewhat helped us out.",

    "text": "I came here with friends for Happy Hour (2-6pm) before going to the movies. We had a to wait a while for a table since we couldn't sit at the bar because we had somebody under 21 with us. They finally opened another section of the restaurant and we got seated. The interior is quite nice and something I didn't expect from South Point.  Their HH menu includes: edamame, seaweed salad, kurobuta corn dogs, gyoza, garlic chicken bites, chicken lettuce wraps, karaage chicken, fried oysters, ika geso, teriyaki beef sliders, soft-shell crab sliders, salmon kama, pizza, sushi rolls, cocktails, beer and wine. Their regular menu looked promising. They have oxtail soup, for example. Since we only had a few minutes left before our movie starts, we only ordered a few things: Philadelphia roll, Spicy Tuna roll and 777 roll. I normally prefer un-Americanized sushi but for $5-6/roll, why not?  We told our server that we had a movie to catch so, our food came pretty quick. It was waiting for a table that took forever.",

    "text": "Food: I've only come here during the Happy Hour and ordered from the HH menu. I've been here a couple of times now and was disappointed to see that their Eggplant Fries are no longer on the HH menu. It reminded me of Portobello Fries but more tender.  Although there wasn't much flavor to it, the dipping sauce complimented it well. These were probably my favorite on their HH food menu. I've had the Chili Garlic Edamame as well and I really liked the flavor here. It was a good amount of seasoning that really fought out the flavor of the edamame. We also had the Ahi Poke, which was really good, but I felt I could have fresher fish elsewhere. I really like the fact they have a number of sushi rolls on their HH menu, and what now looks like some kind of pizza. I probably will try one of these during my next visit.   Environment/Ambiance: The restaurant itself is tucked in a small corner of the casino and is a bit small, with booths lining the walls and a large sushi bar in the middle. It's a very open area that's connected to the casino floor. It looks as though they may get a bit busy during their Happy Hour so sometimes there's a bit of a wait.  Service: During my first visit, I don't remember our server being negligent. During our second visit, our server was attentive...at first. But when she noticed that we were just ordering drinks (we had already eaten and were planning on eating later) we saw her less and less. She only checked on us once and that was just to see if we wanted a refill on our drinks. It came to the point where I honestly thought she had forgotten she was our server as she walked by us a number of times without even a glance our way. We were on a time crunch and we couldn't even flag her down to ask for the check.  Tips: They have great deals for the Happy Hour, which is every day from 2pm-6pm, but come early as it can get a bit busy.",

The service was quick, food came out fast, and we satisfied by the end of the meal.   The chili garlic edamame is the best I've ever tried!!! I could seriously eat two bowl of it in one sitting. (I've already dined here twice and gotten it every time hehe)   The dynamite green mussel is so bomb! Very cheesy though, but nonetheless so good. The salmon poke (also on the HH menu) was good! Also on the HH menu was fried oysters!! So cheap and good! I also tried the 777 & Spicy Mexican roll. 777 was delicious, spicy Mexican was okay! Kinda plain. The YT sashimi was very fresh! I enjoyed all the sushi I ate here. And let me tell you, I am a picky sushi critic.   The tonkotsu ramen with pork belly was okay! Nothing toooo special.   If I lived in Vegas, I'd drive here just to eat this place :)",

Didn't get our waiter's name but he was an Asian guy with a bigger build and he was very attentive. Never did we sit around and wait for him to come and take our order, refill our waters, or get our check.  What we got: 777 roll, $6. Spicy soft shell crab inside, with spicy tuna outside topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. Gotta say I was expecting more like a spider roll as far as texture. Couldn't really tell it was soft shell crab. And with all the \"spicy\" in the description, it wasn't that spicy. 3/5  Hamachi kama (Yellowtail collar) w ponzu $5 They were out of the salmon collar so the waiter recommended this. It was actually really good and had a good amount of meat on it. The skin was nice and crisp, but make sure you eat it fast! 5/5  Fried oysters $5 Three pieces panko coated served with Yuzu aioli and tonkatsu sauce. Loved this as well! The oysters were very silky and still had a nice oyster taste. Some fried oysters I've had were overcooked till they fried the snot out of them.  I couldn't tell the aioli was yuzu flavored though. 4.5/5  Hoisin Pork Belly Bao $5 Served with pickled radishes. I was expecting actual pork belly slices. This was more like pulled pork. Also the Hoisin was very sweet to me. I preferred to use the tonkatsu sauce instead. 3/5  Including tax and tip, the two of us for this light meal was $27. Not too bad. Usually Happy Hours end up costing us at least $40 and then does not feel like a deal at all.  Even if we got drinks, we still would have gotten in under $40. Will def return!",

Prior to our visit, I called to tell them we had a large group coming for oxtail soup.  I didn't want them to run out.  Steve, the manager returned my call and thanked me for considering dining with them.  Upon my arrival, I went to the restaurant to meet with Steve.  He was very nice and professional.  He said he was all prepared for our reservations for Sunday, spoke to the chef and staff and assured me they will not run out of Oxtail. On Sunday, he greeted me and my family, set us up in their private dining room, and introduced us to our waiter for the evening, Rory.  Rory and the rest of the wait staff were very attentive.  The sushi was fresh and yummy.  The Oxtail was fall-off-the-bone delicious.  Thank you Steve and Rory!  All 15 of us had a fabulous time at your restaurant with our family and no one left hungry.  We will see you again next year!",

The hot dogs are good, get the happy hour one, pork belly skewer was very goodWe also ordered the oxtail tostada which didn't taste like oxtail at all, it was shredded meat could have been pork meat but ultimately haf no glavor. The family had edamame, spring rolls, and a teriyaki bowl which were just okay. Eggplant fries are good, my wife liked them once she put soy on them. The fries also needed salt. It's only okay.

Which was not expected but well worth it. The Kitchen  was clean and organized which got us more excited about the food.    Yoji recommended the Japanese Ox Tail Curry... Yummy... Authentic Japanese Curry with tender ox tail that falls right off the bone served over rice... This was the first dish that came out and it was so delightful.  We also had sushi the Blazin Tuna, was one of my favorites, Spicy tuna with a bit of Cajun tuna topping it off.  All the sushi was great and was fresh.   We had about 5 more rolls and the Cajun Albacore Sashimi ... They all left us wanting more to bad we were full..    The Service was great and was checking in with us. They made us feel at home.    We took my cousin that lives in town and she says she told me this place will be in her eating rotation from now on.    We will definitely be back and will bring more people too....  Its worth the the stop at South Point Casino.",

(california roll and teriyaki chicken bowl) I would definitely come back here or any of the other south point restaurants since they are all allergy friendly.",

Make sure you ask for Chris or Rex!  There is a good selection on whatever type of sushi or rolls and a variety on sake as well. Apparently, the bar in the lobby have $1 shots or drinks after 10pm? Didn't get a chance to check it out.   Overall, definitely recommended. 10% off the bill if you check into Yelp!",

From the very first taste tasting, we were blown away at the professionalism and quality of service provided! My spouse and I were coming in from out of state to have our wedding in Las Vegas and had many obstacles, especially finding the perfect caterer, but Zenshin made it an easy choice from the beginning.  The management was extremely personable and detailed in the services they provided. We never felt pressured into anything we did not want and they genuinely made us feel like we were their most valuable customers. Additionally, there was a vast variety of food on the menu, and every single thing we ordered was delicious! It was hard to narrow down the choices because we wanted everything on the menu after we experienced the taste tasting. On our wedding day, the caterers were all set up and ready to go at our venue when an hour before the wedding started we had to move the reception across town. Not only were they flexible, the rushed over to set up at the new location and their execution was FLAWLESS and they did not miss a beat! Everybody loved their food, especially their sushi and desserts! Zenshin saved the day and I would recommend this staff any day of the week!",

(Honestly, it takes a little bit more effort for me to be compelled to say or share the positive than the negatives like most people do).  Zenshin's owner and general manager had reached out to me after my negative experience.  I shared my story and they replied that I felt it was sincere.  They handled my situation fair and well.  I am actually impress of how they handled themselves towards me because during our communication via email, I was still feeling the bad taste in my mouth regarding the service I and the rest of my group received in their restaurant.  Everyone knows that first impression counts and they failed miserably on that category but the lasting impression I received left me feeling respected.  Thank you for not giving up on me Zenshin.  I can definitely respect that.  Moving on........here is my final review.  The food is delicious (like I mentioned in my original review).  If service was good the first time around, I would have no problem giving you Zenshin all 5 stars.  So....the fact that I went from rating Zenshin 1 star to 4 stars should probably give everyone an idea that their food is a delight.  Again, thank you.",

Both rolls were great and yummy, 4.5/5. One thing i will say that i wasn't aware of was the 3$ fee if you want to box  up your uneaten leftovers.

Unfortunately I won't go back due solely to the hostesses as long as they work there I will not go.  They are always rude and treat me poorly which is bad for a regular. Last week was the worst. I arrived and 75% of the sushi bar was empty they made me wait to be seated. That was fine but when they seated me they put me at the angled end of the bar basically at the waitress station and almost in the kitchen. It's not even a full seat.  When I said something they offered me another seat wedged in between 2 other people.   The restaurant was seriously 75% empty and this is how they treat someone who spends a lot of money there.   They have 3 hostesses who have no idea how to treat customers.",

My one complaint is the long wait times with a number of open tables. I am sure this has to do with labor and not wanting to overburden staff; but it does leave a pretty negative image when you're waiting to sit down and see 5 open tables.",

The broth was very full bodied, with a soy sauce base.  Very ono.  The other two nights I had the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Miso Ramen.  Both ramen bowls had very good broth.  Do yourself a favor and order an extra piece of pork belly char Siu.  So ono.  The noodles in the ramen are not overdone and still al dente, like it should be.  Soup was piping hot like it should be.  Highly recommended for their ramen!",

I had the burger also and let me tell you,  it was one of the best burgers I have had. I think it's soy sauce in the meat. Whatever special delicious sauce they used, It was amazing. I didn't really like the eggplant fries but the dipping sauce that came with them was very good.   Everyone there was really friendly and to top it all off, you get a 10 percent coupon from yelp when you check in. The sushi was so good we went for lunch one night and came back for dinner a couple of days later. This was one of my favorite restaurants in this hotel. I don't think that you can go wrong here. It wasn't that crowded, which was nice because it allowed me and husband some time have a mini date. I definitely recommend going there if you are at south point hotel.",

Hostess told us no you can't just sit there, there's 12 parties ahead of you.....okay, so we waited, and waited. All the parties were large parties that required tables, not one person was sat at the sushi bar itself.   Once seated, we ordered an appetizer of edamame, never got it, had to ask....oh ooops. Then our sushi came, the fish pieces were the smallest I have ever seen, the roll that we ordered had huge pieces of something that was almost impossible to chew through. This place is not cheap, but their idea of sushi certainly is. Avoid this place at all cost....!!!!",

Well, the salmon in the salad tasted brunt. The bottom of the crispy rice also was burnt. The 777 roll was pretty good. Their garlic chicken was nicely fried and was probably the closet thing to mitsu-ken's garlic chicken in Hawaii.  The oxtail curry was delicious! I liked the pickled and fried potato strings that came with it. I thought their creme brulee was the best looking dish of the night and it was good. If it wasn't for the burnt dishes, I would give this place 5 stars. We will try this place again during happy hour...",

Aaron is great, his suggestions are spot on, he remembers us and what we have had and liked, and his sushi rolls are beautiful and delicious.   The happy hour is a great deal. I've been able to try many items at an affordable cost. The crunch roll is my favorite but I am now a big fan of the 777. The garlic edamame is fantastic! The Asahi beer is nice and cold off the tap and refreshing. Jesse is a terrific bartender we are always happy when he is there! The service is always wonderful and we have no complaints. Our visits have been friendly, inviting, delicious, and enjoyable.  I am now the the one begging my husband to take me out to see Aaron, Jesse and the rest of the crew at Zenshin!",

We were pretty patient, but we lost it when the table next to us who was seated 20 minutes after my group got their orders before us. On top of that, no one cleared our plates... standard sushi procedure. Three servers passed our stack of plates by. Our server was not remorseful, instead he gave us attitude when we asked for our bills. We spoke to a manager to report the service and the answer we got was basically \"tough luck\"  Don't waste your evening here. There are too many good places to choose from.",

From the miso black cod to the 007 roll to sea weed salad and even a cocktail.  The rolls are good and there are plenty to choose from. And the cod has been both excellent and not good. But fish is a delicate dish so let's call the few misses victims of circumstance.   They are always very friendly and accommodating. And with all the menu options, I dare say even those who aren't down with sushi, will be able to find something they are happy to eat.",

    "text": "The Happy Hour is from 2-6pm and the menu dedicated for Happy Hour has one side drinks under $6 and the other side appetizers, sushi rolls and pizza..average price is $5. I saw Karage Chicken, Salmon Poke, California Rolls included in HH menu.  I ordered the pork belly bao buns which were really good! The bun was soft, the pork belly was a little too crisp though. 3 appetizer sized came in a fancy platter. Unfortunately my phone had low bat so no foodporn for this review.   The menu I was given was primarily sushi and a few beef/chicken bowl options. I didn't see any bento boxes as my choice. Come to find out later that is only on the dinner menu?  So I ended up with eggplant fries and the beef teri as my entree since I don't really care for sushi...(yeah I know blasphemy)   The Eggplant fries: YAY!....  The Teriyaki bowl: NAY! ... I really like these fries!!  Veggies dipped and fried in a light tempura batter and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. For sure I would order this again. Very good!  The Teri bowl though, not so much. The sliced beef pieces I had was a little dry and tough and the teriyaki sauce was too thick and salty for me.  Location: Inside South Point Casino next to Steak N Shake. You can either sit at the sushi bar or the tables and booths surrounding it. There is also another dining room but it was not being used at the time.    Service: Staff is still lacking in finesse department. Service started out fine but after I got served my entree, I didn't see my server till I got my check. Granted he had to cover a lot of tables in his area, it was not that busy in my opinion.  I needed silverware and couldn't get his attention at all so after a few minutes went by I had get up and ask someone else. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot but a little acknowledgement can go a long way you know?   Hopefully the kinks will get worked out cause I really would like to come back and try more items on that Happy Hour menu. That Lychee Martini sounds good.",

The hostesses graciously invited me to sit in the waiting room and use it. One hour later as I was getting ready to leave, the Director of Operations came by to offer me a glass of water. If I did not have dietary restrictions, I would definitely have eaten there. I appreciate their generosity and thoughtfulness in customer service.",

I ordered the fried noodles with vegetables for takeout ($10) add $2 for chicken or $4 for shrimp Japanese-style fried noodles with onions carrots green onions bonito flakes and pickled ginger. The dish was very tasty with good texture not overcooked but after a while was salty and not consistent. Would've loved to give these folks a 4 star but due to the saltiness and three glasses of cold water after my meal I decided to give them 3 star! The folks where friendly taking my order quick and fast! YES I would go back because... I give many places a second chance even after three stars next time I will order but request little or no salt!",

The service was pretty good and prompt and drink refills were attended to as well as periodic check ups on how we were doing.  I had the miso soup ramen and the pork tonkatsu.  miso soup ramen was just the right amount of salty you'd expecct from miso soup.  I thought the corn was out of place in  such a yummy dish.  I ordered some Hamachi sushi and it was a nice belly piece and tasted fresh from the ocean.  I also had some tempura fried California rolls and that was the right mix of crunch.  These guys do it right.  I'd go again.  Maybe next time I will sit at the sushi bar.  Oh, the pork tonkatsu bowl was standard fare.  Nothing different from your typical Japanese/Local Hawaiian food shops around.",

The slight difference between the two is that Zenshin's menu is more Japanese focused. I just learned recently that they're under the same management, what a coincidence!  I'm all about the island fusion flavor so I had high hopes. The layout and seating was quite clean and modernized with a centered sushi bar. We were a party of six, and gorging is what we came for. It's an Asian Hog Feast is what I call it. So the dinner started with Ahi Poke Tacos, Eggplant fries, fried calamari, dynamite green mussels, fried soft shell crab, and tons of mouth watering rolls specifically the 8 second bull ride. The eggplant fries and ahi poke tacos was the highlight of the appetizers. If you're itching for ramen or anything soup base, try the oxtail soup or the Ton Katsu ramen. :)",

    "text": "This little sushi place in the South Pointe Casino is extremely good.  I don't know why others say this place is expensive. This place is very reasonable; I would know bc I'm Japanese and eat out to Japanese restaurants all the time. Their quality of fish is much higher than the kind served up at an all-u-can-eat. Obviously noob yelpers can't tell the difference. This place also has delicious fried eggplant fries with a garlic mayo. Soo good. Oh yeah, and their California rolls are one of the best I've had. It was literally a perfect balance of fake crab, rice and veggies/avocado!  Highly recommend for a quick, delicious meal.  I only found it because my family wanted to find a casino that had bingo lol.",

The food is wonderful, (happy hour has great specials) the servers are really nice and efficient and a manager always comes by to check on things and say hello. Today the manager waited on us because our server was busy. He was really nice and took great care of us.   No matter what time of day we go to Zenshin we never seem to have to wait. It seems to be a well- kept secret, hidden in the back corner of South Pointe Hotel and Casino.",

    "text": "BOOORING...same ol' sushi places serving up your typical sushi dishes you see everywhere else.  If you're as tired as I am of the usual, THIS is the SPOT to go with their unique an innovative dishes!!  We had a lot to eat here so forgive me for the long review.  SERVICE: Greeted with a smile and promptly seated to accommodate our group of 6 as promised with our reservation.  The night we went was pretty busy so I would recommend a reservation ahead of time.  Our server explained all the popular dishes like they were being presented in front of a panel of judges on the the FOOD NETWORK.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  On with the food!   FOOD: I had to say at first thought, how great can a sushi restaurant in South Point be, I mean I see SHISHITO PEPPERS everywhere....WOW...these peppers might be the best things on the planet right now.  A perfect appetizer; their menu is much too humble.  The peppers are nice and flavorful from the grill with a miso sauce that melts in your mouth.  I could eat a hundred of these with the most authentic Japanese beer and liquor selection I have ever seen.  The TOKYO BLACK stout was especially complimenting of the meal.  And EGGPLANT FRIES nice and crunchy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. Truly a great texture experience for the palette.  JALAPENO YELLOWTAIL sashimi; fresh as it was caught the moment we walked  into the restaurant.  Nice sizeable slices of yellowtail with a pleasant ponzu sauce. OYSTERS on the half shell, I can't remember which ones they were, but we picked the recommended ones by the server.  Once again, I swear these guys have their own ocean in the back.  Very fresh and subtly sweet with great yuzu sauce compliments.  DOUBLE DOWN SALMON; I do love my salmon and this roll is perfection.  combining fresh salmon with crunchy salmon skin with salmon eggs with the ailoi cuts nicely through the richness.  The 8 SECOND BULL RIDE is truly a treat for the senses. Harmonizing the ingredients much like a surf and turf into a roll.  The beef is so tender that its like velvet.  DESSERT: MINI MALASSADAS are addictive!  The only complaint is that they don't give me a box of them!  I suppose its their lure of getting me back into their booth. (which is working).  Next time I'll have to try their in-house made Ramen noodles.",

Friendly staff,  but bad service during non - happy hour time. 2 tables were only being served (including our's), but it seems that our server is you busy chit-chatting with other waiters. Ordered Spider roll, not as what I expected from the reviews. Oxtail soup what ok, bland. Can't go wrong with mango mochi, just well presented in a plate. Also, we didn't know we are 10 minutes before happy hour until I heard the other party next to our table. The waitress gave them an option if they're ordering for happy hour, they can wait for a couple of minutes.  That's our waitress,  but she never gave us that option. Anyway, if you have time to drive a few minutes for a great Oxtail soup, I'll go to California Hotel & Casino instead.",

    "text": "Food was decent but overall my experience was pretty bad. My friends and I went there for happy hour. We had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated. They never apologized for the wait or reassured us that they will help us soon. The hostess even seemed unsure about the situation when we asked how long we had to wait. It wasn't even busy. My friend was on a time crunch so we were hoping we could eat together for a little bit and she could leave. The wait lessened our time and my friend told the waitress she had to leave soon so she wanted her food to go. The waitress said she couldn't do that and explained that they couldn't let her bring it to go because people take advantage of the cheap price. But my friend didn't have time because of the wait and had only ordered one roll to go which is not taking advantage of the prices They messed up her order also which made her have even less time to eat. Our waitress only came back to us once when we asked for the checks. The only person who was friendly and made it a better experience was the guy who cleared our table and filled our waters.  I ordered the crunch roll which is okay compared to other sushi restaurants. The furakake salmon poke was good but would not be worth the price if it wasn't happy hour prices. I tried other restaurants that serve the same items that are better and aren't even Japanese restaurants.   I would give the food another chance just because I can't judge the quality based on my 2 items I tried but hope the service wouldn't be as terrible as what I experienced.",

I had the Asian Pear and Goat Cheese salad, and Keith had the Poke Salad and a sushi roll (not sure what it was). All were beautifully displayed, and tasted amazing. As always, the service is impeccable and prompt. Very romantic for dinner, and a bit lighter for lunch. If you are looking for a modern style Japanese restaurant with super fresh and beautiful food, try this place, you won't be disappointed!",

On the one night we wanted some Asian food but did not know what was nearby. I decided to take a chance with Zenshin and was pleasantly surprised.   We got the teriyaki beef and the teriyaki chicken with the baked California rolls. It was fantastic from the service to the decor to the food. You will not be disappointed except that if you are staying at SP that they have no fridge or microwave in your room for leftovers!",

The teriyaki chicken was good, flavorful, but missing some grilling - needed maybe a bit more for nice crunch. The salmon appeared to be very good.  Creme brulee was very good. Loved the nice touch of the sugar netting over the dish. The yuzu-orange semifreddo was also very tasty.  All in all, nice place, nice servers, nice environment, nice desserts - the entrees could maybe use a little work - they're good, just not the best.  Oh yeah - Yelp check-in was silly. It was a High Five. What was it? Waiter didn't know, had to ask manager - oh yeah, it was a \"high five\" - no food, no discount. Silly.",

I ordered a refreshing cucumber cocktail ($5)... it had a fancy shamncy name, but I forget what it was called.  It was a part of the happy hour cocktail menu, however, so it's easy to find.  For food, I ordered the chili edamame, furikake salmon poke, and spider roll.  Everything was good; delightful for a happy hour.  I also ordered an Asahi, $2 draft.

    "text": "I've really been dreading having to write this review....  I have wanted to dine here for quite awhile, and heard that they have great Happy Hour.  So on a Sunday night, before my bowling league, I decided to stop in for some dinner.  It was pretty busy (around 5pm), but the hostess was able to seat me at the sushi bar.  I was approached immediately by a very nice server and ordered an Asahi Draught (only $2!).  I also mentioned to her that I am not a very experienced sushi eater and she offered suggestions for me.  Although I was more than ready to order some sushi, she kind of led me away from that....  I ended up starting with the chili garlic edamame ($3 I think?).  This was a large portion for one person, so definitely enough to share in the future.  I then ordered the Karaage chicken ($5) and teriyaki beef sliders ($4).    While I was sitting there, enjoying my beer and Edamame, I saw the hostess following a gentleman who stopped by me at the bar.  I heard her telling him that she could not ask me to move - so he stood there, hovering over me.  It was extremely uncomfortable, and after a few minutes, he asked if I would be willing to move over 1 seat so that the 3 people in his party could sit there (again, awkward).  I know that this isn't the restaurant's fault, but it was weird.  I had food and drinks in front of me and I would just never ask someone to move while they are eating.  In the meantime, it took a long time for my small food order to come out.  I hadn't really noticed, but the waitress came to apologize and said that the kitchen was a bit backed up, trying to catch up on the last hour of HH.  No big deal, it came out a few minutes later.  I'll start with the sliders.  There were 2 in the order.  The meat was very dry, but overall they were tasty, especially for the price.  The karaage chicken was a HUGE disappointment.  I took 1 bite and almost threw up when it tasted (and looked like) it was raw inside.  The outside was very well done and crunchy, so I am not sure how this happened to the inside, but it was not appetizing.  My server seemed very busy and didn't ever come back to check on me.  A Manager came by awhile later to clear some plates next to me, and I told him he could also take mine.  He asked if I didn't enjoy the karaage chicken, but I didn't say anything.  I am not a complainer (although with something that could be a heatlh concern, I probably should have brought it up), and I was in a bit of a rush at this point.  I just told him that it was \"alright,\" and that I was just full.  When the server came around, I asked for my check.  She brought it back a few minutes later and mentioned that they removed the karaage chicken since I didn't like it.  I thought this was AWESOME.  I know that the chicken was only $5, and I didn't complain....but the manager recognized that most of it wasn't touched and removed it without me saying anything.  More restaurants should do this.  I gave my server the check, with my debit card immediately, but after about 10 minutes, she hadn't returned with it.  After awhile she saw me still sitting there and said \"they haven't brought your check back yet?!!\" Apparently someone else was running my card because she was busy, and they walked up right at that minute.  There doesn't seem to be very good communication with the staff - while sitting at the sushi bar, I heard many times that people had been waiting 30 minutes or more for sashimi.  Maybe they were just having a bad night altogether.  I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and 3 stars based off of how proactive the manager was, even without me saying anything.  All of the other reviews seem pretty decent, so it could have just been an off night.",

First, Zenshin was super accommodating for getting our party of TWELVE seated in short order. I'm not going to try and remember everyone's dishes but EVERYONE was totally taken care of by the serving staff. The food came out in a timely manner and the drinks were topped up before they got the halfway levels  I enjoyed my daughter's miso soup, a serving of half dozen oysters and the 8-minute roll. The oysters were from BC.  They were on the small side but very flavorful and meaty.. No points off here .I go for quality over quantity. The roll was also a hit..  This experience was so good that I am actually on my way, right now, to pick up a togo order before I head out on the red eye",

Got off to a bit of a rocky start.  They asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or a table.  We said first available then waited over 20 min for them to sit us at the bar that was vacant the whole time.  Once inside we could see there were several open tables as well.  I understand restaurants need to stagger tables.  20 min seemed a bit much.  Maybe I just needed a drink.  Lol.  You can make reservations for happy hour so I will definitely do that next time.    We started with a Melona Breeze and Coronarita.  Second round was Caribbean Cosmo and Carpe Diem.  Drinks were yummy.  For food we chose Chicken teriyaki pizza, 777, crunch and spider rolls.  Everything but the spider roll came out quick.  Sushi tasted great.  I don't usually think of pizza when going to sushi but the chicken teriyaki pizza was really good too.  We thought they forgot the spider roll.  We were pretty full so didn't mind as long as we weren't charged.  If ended up coming out after we were done with our other food.  Not sure if that was by design.  Food, drinks and value make up for the few minor hiccups.  Zenshin will be in my happy hour rotation.",

I had the calamari appetizer ($9), which was good, however very processed.  I like to see tentacles, this was like steak fries of calamari.  Flavor was good.  Entree was ahi poke bowl.  I thought it would be small and I would still be hungry afterward.  I was wrong.  This thing fought back and I had trouble finishing.  A good value at $14.    The food was very good, quality was amazing. This is in stark contrast to the neighboring buffet that I experienced seafood night at - that was a total bomb as the food quality sucked.  I would totally recommend Zenshin over the buffet, especially since Zenshin was a few dollars less than the dog food experience at the Garden Buffet.  I would also recommend Zenshin as a top place regardless of other restaurants.  If I stay at the casino again, I'd like to take the wife out here.",

I was looking for a nice meal in Las Vegas before catching a plane and was afraid to stay on the main strip because of rush hour traffic. Zenshin is located inside the South Point Casino, not in a standalone building as your favorite map may indicate. To get there, park in the large surface lot off of South Las Vegas Boulevard, enter through the main casino entrance, and walk through the casino to the back left corner. Despite its location, the smell of smoke was not too strong. We had a 5PM reservation on a Monday, and were seated at the bar right away. All of the servers were very friendly, but oddly it took a while for service to get going; with so many servers available, I am not sure why we were seated at the bar where there was only one bartender working to both make drinks and take our order. Once our order was in, though, our meal came out quickly. Both the tempura roll with fried sweet potato and the garden isle roll were flavorful and beautifully presented. It took us about 30 minutes total to be in and out, exactly what you want before catching a plane. I really enjoyed this last meal in Las Vegas and would not hesitate to come again!",

    "text": "Seeking salty, delicious, vegetarian, healthy cuisine! Seems to be that I discovered that here at Zenshin!  Even though I have incorporated healthy eating into my lifestyle; I am not going to stop eating out. Never! Food is my passion, so I am incorporating new delights into my life. I will be adding Zenshin as one of these ideal places where I can enjoy fresh and delicious food while staying physically fit!  Best happy hour in Las Vegas! One has to come to the far far South of Las Vegas to experience this exceptional excellence! Is that a play on words? You decide.  One would think with the best happy hour menu that I have seen there would be lines, not the case! I was seated immediately at the squarish table around the bar! In the middle of this square is the space the raw zen chefs create the masterpieces that we eat. Hooray for Zenshin restaurant for allowing the customers see how they make and prepare the food. While being seated by the lovely hostess, I was asked if this was acceptable. Replying of course I sat down and took a gander at the menu!  With so many choices here for dinner it is hard to select something for dinner! What to choose? Not knowing what I wanted, I ordered a few dishes the only thing wrong with this choice I discovered afterward is with what to do with the left overs. In order to take leftovers they charge you! Inquiring more about this policy they do this in order to keep their baseline low so they can keep providing amazing food at such minimal pricing. Plus if an individual is dead set on taking home a doggy bag it will set you back $3.00. No biggie but another first for me. Vegas always continues to surprise and keep one on their toes.  Cocktails are a must and this was the first gander that I tackled. The happy hour menu again has an exceptional variety for around $7.00. The Aloha Sunset was the martini that I decided to try this visit. Eventually I will try them all. The green of the Midori liqueur gives that stunning green visual as a back drop for this drink. The other flavors that are infused to make the sunset are the bright yellow of the pineapple juice and the red of the Grenadine. Together this trio makes a glowing sundown even livelier. The drink uses ginger Vodka to tie the trio of liqueur flavors together; and as many know ginger has fantastic healing process for the body. Now you know that since this drink may add to ones betterment of ones health then have seconds.   At new places I like to sample a few dishes to get a feel of the menu, especially if I plan on eating at that location frequently. On this first visit I decided to first explore the vegetarian menu; which all one has to do is ask for it. The happy hour menu incorporates most of the items that I was considering; so a win-win. Knowing that they make Cucumber Rolls this is what I started with. In fact, the chef in the middle of the square handed me the rolls after I watched him make them. So fresh and amazing. Don't we wish all of our food was made in front of us and then handed off! The Vegetable Stir Fry I tried this time around and was it a delightful choice. The sauce was light and not heavy, while the veggies were cooked to perfection.   To continue with my order the vegetable spring rolls were so tempting, but I thought would taste great along side the heavenly steamed veggies. You know what they absolutely did! If you like it hot and spicy then the sauce that they serve with the spring rolls will appeal to you. I love it hot so the sauce was yummy. In fact the left over sauce after finishing the spring rolls I mixed in with the Veggie Stir Fry, and kicked it up a notch. As I enjoyed my food the server checked in on me several times and asked how everything was. The server was very pleasant and kept the drinks coming and the water cup filled.   The only issues that I did experience on this trip was with one of the dishes that I ordered. I decided to have the chicken lettuce wraps. The only reason for this was the inclusion of mushrooms that the server told me comes in equal parts to the chicken. This is False, or the server was misinformed. The chicken lettuce wraps are appealing to the eye at first glance. I decided that when I got the order that I would brush off the chicken and use the mushrooms in the lettuce only. This was not the case. There was literally small pieces of mushrooms and the rest chicken on the said lettuce wraps. Not what I was expecting, since the server informed me otherwise. Well lesson learned I sent the plate back with only picking at the mushrooms and trying the lettuce from one of the three on the plate. Its not that it was terrible, it is not what I wanted. I was just misinformed. For this mishap I left the review at four stars.   While I plan to eat here many more times as I have already, make sure that when placing your order with your server it is clear and concise. If you have an issue ask for the manager. This was a meaningless mistake. Now enjoy Zenshin! Go!",

Came here on a friend referral who is a local of Vegas. Remind me to call my friend later. Appears most of the locals come here for the oxtail ramen. Sounds delicious and hearty right? Negative. Oxtail was tough. You had to pierce your fork into the meat and kind of fight with it just to eat instead of it nicely peeling off the bone as it should be. Also tried out some of their HH appetizers, none really worth mentioning. The Hamachi tail was actually cooked well. Location is off the strip, inside South Point Casino. Another negative. Not well ventilated, my eyes were burning from the smoke, my poor lungs were working doubletime. Overall, I don't see myself coming back here.",

Rory, Chris and Rex have all been long gone and although the server, Sunny, we got last night was excellent and the food by Dan and Andre were great at the bar it has a couple issues...the music has gotten too thumpy for dinner time and each time we come, even if the place is dead and no one is sitting at the bar, we are asked to wait 10 minutes.  I asked about that but I got a song and dance about \"We have to make sure we don't slam our waiters\" which is silly considering no one was there.  II think the management needs to hire more adult or better trained people at the door. Still the best Japanese food and service anywhere in Vegas!",

I made the reservation as I was walking towards the Restaurant.  When I got there they mentioned a 1 1/2 hr wait until i showed them my reservation on yelp.   That reservation got me in in 10 minutes.

Impressed with our first visit we came back.   Do not miss the oxtail dumpling soup. The broth has a hint of \"Bulalo\" flavor, if you're Filipino (or enjoy  Filipino food), you'll know what I'm talking about. Must try the garlic shrimp, stuffed shiso with spicy tuna, grilled Scottish salmon and eggplant fries. They also have a wide selection of sushi rolls - the 8 Second Bull Ride stood out and lingers in gastronomic memory. Yum!  Also need to mention the service was excellent. You can make reservations through your Open Table app.",

Their menu consisted of Japanese and Hawaiian fusion. I decided on the Shotgun Waygu Burger (not sure if I got the spelling right) on the lunch special with Parmesan eggplant fries! I wasn't even able to take a picture because the food looked too good and I inhaled it right away. I unfortunately didn't do it enough justice. Sorry guys! Let me tell you I don't normally eat burgers unless they are an Asian fusion, but I ate everything! It was amazing and a must try. It also came with onion rings. We tried their crunch roll on the lunch special and it was delicious. I usually get special rolls but the taste was on point! They were very accommodating with the little one when I'd ask for little things like extra cucumbers for her etc. They even gave us another miso soup for whatever reason was wrong with the first that I didn't notice. Lastly the dessert was as equally impressive with presentation and taste!  Our server frequently checked up on us and the manager was even able to stop by our table to greet us.  Overall the service was on point and the ambience which I forgot to mention was soothing. We will definitely come back here to try other things on the menu!",

But I called and told them we were coming down and wanted to get a table. They made sure we would have a table that accommodated all of us by the time that we got there 30 minutes later with no wait. Our server was very nice and attentive, making sure that the food for the kids came out first as they were both starting to get \"hangry.\" I ordered one of the specials which had the teriyaki salmon collar, miso soup, salad, rice, and came with a glass of wine (which someone else drank cause I don't drink).  Just like our last trip, the food was fantastic and very flavorful. The shishito peppers I ordered for my appetizer was really good, but kind of wish they were spicy. Not complaining though! Over all, great service, great food, very accommodating staff. Will for sure come back again!",

He had a nice personality and was courteous without being overbearing.   The food was tremendously better than expected. I ordered a tempura roll, with the chicken teriyaki entree and my boo ordered the hibachi salmon. Both entrees included miso soup (which I don't like in general), but our server was able to give me an extra serving of salad, instead of miso soup. The salad was exceptionally fresh! Although I'm a sushi virgin, the tempura roll was delicious ;-)  My teriyaki chicken was fresh and cooked to perfection. The chicken wasn't dry, like most dishes. Although I did not taste the salmon, it looked very appealing! The presentation of the dishes was admirable..  I left feeling full, but not heavy...like I usually feel after eating...especially when the good is good. Lol. The food was light, healthy and FRESH!  I will definitely eat here again.

Well, I finally came myself.   We had Glory as our server and I believe Robby was the name of the busser. Both were very attentive, sweet and fulfilled our needs. I love sauce and always order the specific sauce I need when I order. It grinds my gears when my food comes out without the sauce, because then my food sits there until the sauce is delivered.... BUT my sauce arrived with the food and I was PUMPED.   We started with calamari, which were steak chunks and served with a thinner version of teriyaki. Very good. I prefer sweet chili sauce with my calamari but was not disappointed with this sauce.   For rolls, I got the jackpot and my husband got the shotgun shrimp, both with soy paper. The jackpot was fantastic. I loved it.  As for my husband's roll, we think it would be better without the cucumber because it takes over the taste when you bite into it, but otherwise it was great.   There were a good 4 desserts I was eyeing but was too full the try any. We will most definitely be back!!!",

Our server was new, which I understand, and she really tried to make our experience favorable. Initially, she said that our combos came with a miso soup and side salad. Also, I had ordered oysters as an appetizer.  The sushi was okay, the soup was tasteless, and the oysters were the size of a quarter. Six to the serving. They weren't delivered until halfway through the meal, when I asked for them again. When dinner was served, the portions were small, and the prices were big. The green tea ice cream tasted like vanilla.  Then the check came...NO taxes nor total shown!! So I had to add it on my calculator to figure out what dinner would cost. I came up with $70, including a 20% tip, give or take, for the two of us, and we were still hungry.   I asked for a corrected bill, and after waiting for the 15 minute \"hiddle,\" in the back of the restaurant, the manager, Andrew, I believe, finally came over, gave us some dog & pony show about the fraudulent initial check, demanded over $90 for meal, and said that he can't do anything to attempt to satisfy us, but ask for him \"next time.\" Oh, they tried to charge separately for the \"included\" dinner salad, too.  Like we'd ever go back...",

Fresh and tasty!  The service wasn't as good as I would have liked. I ordered takeout. I had hoped to receive everything I paid for.  I take some of the blame for this poor review. It clearly states on the sales receipt to check your order for all items. I feel I shouldn't have to, the should get it right. I paid for it. Well I think you can guess my dessert was missing from my order. $8. They got free from me. Consider it a tip.  I won't return and don't recommend!  I feel they should have made sure everything was in the order before handing it to me to go and wait on someone else. It was to fast and hurried. My fault for not looking but I only saw the note after I had gotten back to the room.  Lesson learned!   UPDATE:  May 11, 2019  I didn't expect a reply,  but today I received it. I was contacted by the owner who offered an apology. It was greatly appreciated! To me that is great customer service. Both of us in the wrong yet, he stepped up to offer an apology and correct the situation. It was never about the food quality it was excellent.  I would recommend this restaurant based on the excellent food I received as well as the management and ownership willing to reach out to correct a mistake made on both parties. Thank you !!!",

    "text": "This was a very good dining experience for a hotel restaurant!  The exterior looks simple, but inside you'll find a very upscale-looking dining room. Staff were extremely friendly from beginning to end and were extremely attentive with drink refills.   We tried a variety of dishes including gyoza, edamame, and calamari to start. All were very good!  The gyoza tasted handmade and not frozen. The calamari was the real highlight, though. It was not prepared in rings but looked more like a mozzarella stick. It was delicious!  Tender and crispy with a perfect flavor.   For entree I had the pork tonkatsu. This was quite good. It was not the absolutely tenderest meat I've ever had, but it was quite good and crispy without being greasy. I opted for the side of curry which was honestly nothing special. It tasted a bit like a boxed mix, so I would pass on this add-on next time.   For dessert we tried the fried ice cream. This was excellent! It had a wonderful thin coating of cake surrounding the ice cream between the ice cream and the crunchy coating. A small touch, but it made it even more delicious!   Overall this was a very good experience and is definitely recommended!",

In terms of seating, they have tables, seats near the sushi bar, and a couple private rooms.  Ate here for dinner on New Year's eve and we didn't have any any reservations. With it being a big holiday, we were thankful we got in. There was a short wait so we gambled while we waited. Not long after, we receive a call from the hostess letting us know our table is ready.  The spicy salmon roll was my favorite!  Don't forget to check in on yelp for a percentage off your bill.",

Only part that sucked is when more people showed up from our party (indecisive men that \"weren't hungry\" when we first went), they had to get on the waitlist for their own table instead of pulling up chairs to ours. I get it though, it's a busy spot with limited space. My girls got the ox tail soup and loved it. I got the carnitas tacos and wasn't super impressed. They were decent but the carnitas could've used more flavor. However, I can't complain! It's not a Mexican restaurant lol. Overall great experience.

I had the Shogun Shrimp Roll- Shrimp Tempura, Snow Crab, Cucumber Roll, Topped with Cooked Shrimp, Avocado, Torched Garlic Aioli, Eel Sauce & Green Onions, the California Rolls and the Crunch-Shrimp Tempura, Krab, Avocado Roll, Topped with Crunchies & Eel Sauce.

Located on the floor level in the South Point hotel and casino, it's easily accessible for casino patrons and hotel guests alike.   Happy Hour has to be the best part of this establishment: daily from 2pm-6pm, Sun-Thurs 9pm-11pm & Fri and Sat from 10pm-1am. My favorites include the Lychee martini, edamame, Crunch Roll and 777 Roll.  Tip: Make a reservation prior to happy hour to ensure seats, especially with a party of four or more.   Restrooms: Located a matter of steps away from the restaurant--bonus!  Parking: Ample parking located on both the casino grounds as well as street parking. Bonus--free!  Customer Service: Consistently good.",

I recently been told that I'm an off the menu orderer, guess I'm spoiled from LA restaurants. I asked if they could do an unagi bowl which wasn't on the menu and the waiter said he'd find out how much it would be. It was something like $34 which was a bit steep to me, so I just got the goat cheese salad with chicken breast. My sister got a poke bowl, two of the kids split a salmon plate, other kid got ramen and my bro in law's mom got udon.  Food took a little while but was really good. My sister's poke bowl had a TON of poke! My salad was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I will say the salmon plate (kitchen split it in half) didn't have a whole lot of salmon.  My niece enjoyed her ramen, but my bro in law's mom said her udon was a bit salty.  Guess you just gotta know what to order here - poke bowl all the way!   But staff was super nice and the food was pretty good!",

Since we held dinner reservations at the Silverado Steakhouse, we decided to take advantage of the $7 happy hour pricing by ordering one cocktail each.  The happy hour seems to be popular so we were told it would be about 15 minutes before we could be accommodated, an estimate that proved to be accurate.  My wife chose a Caribbean Cosmo which included mango rum, pineapple and cranberry.  My beverage of choice was the Li Hing martini (Tyku silver, mango rum, triple sec, lime and a Li-Hing rim).  Both drinks were refreshing and well worth ordering again.",

    "text": "Very poor customer service skills from a gal named Azure. I asked her 3 times regarding seating and she gave me the same mono-toned answer to another question....like a programmed robot. Well, I put that aside and got seated by her at the worse possible seating. Though many booths were available, she put me and my wife at the sushi bar right next to the kitchen door on the end with my seat having no table space for the stack of menus which apparently are there normally. She had a smirk on her face which didn't help. We had a mind to walk out, but timing was upon us as we had pre-purchased movie tickets and needed to eat. So, a fantastic view of folks cooking and washing dishes, not to mention the extra ambiance of kitchen noise. Only good thing about this section was Jesse our server who was great and also two other staff members, even one who looked like the owner or manager in a nice suit came and filled my glass when it was empty. So that made for very good impressions on us. Regarding food, we are from San Francisco (right by the ocean), so we may be what some might consider \"sushi snobs\".....(this being the Nevada dessert), and the portions were rather small and flavor only passable. Too much cucumber in the California Roll, (SF restaurants have only avocado as the veggie, along with the crab and nori......never cucumber....filler?) Again, all our rolls were about 70% the size of what we get back home. After eating we made sure Jesse got a nice tip, and we ended our meal. Now just to make sure I got her name, I said a pleasantry to Miss Azure on the way out so I could see her name tag.......True to form, she half smiled and did not say a word...... So......I will recommend this place for a quick sushi fix but ONLY on Miss Azure's days off from work......not kidding, she really doesn't understand how to talk (or not talk) to customers....too bad she is in a service business. She easily ruined our meal experience with very poor customer service skills. Seriously, does anyone know if there is an opening at the DMV where she can apply for a position? It would be a perfect fit for her.....no lie.",

So, I ordered the rib-eye..... =) =) =)  My advice - try the rib-eye!  Zenshin is a great addition to the South Point Casino!  If you like Japanese food, go check it out.",

When the server brought it out, it was cold.  It was probably sitting in the kitchen waiting for the server to pick it up, service is terrible.   The soy sauce container was empty, asked the server for some more, he never came back.  It's the little the things that makes a great dinner.  The staff needs more training.   Don't go there for service, you won't get it.  And the hostess/cashier had no customer services skills.  Didn't bother asking how dinner was, took our check and told us the amount.",

Usually the service is great when we get served by an asain girl with short hair or a white girl who happily serves us but the last few times we got this bigger guy. I accidently ordered a seaweed salad instead of the cucumber salad last time he served us literally 3 minutes later as i realized it, the server was no where to be found and it was coming to the table oops that was my bad i guess.... (i dont know if it was that because i was so nice and apologetic) we almost felt like he was avoiding us after that the only time he asked if we needed anything was to take our order and once towards the very end, he would fill our waters and leave without seeing if we needed anything else or how it was not even making eye contact. He wasn't busy he had like 3 small tables and was standing by the host stand. The asain girl checked up on us more then him. I work in the food service industry and this was dissapointing how his service was inattentive.  I felt kind of uncomfortable. Oh well ill still go back hopefully he's nicer or we get the girls lol.",

We were with a large group, that took up 3 large round tables, you would think that the management would have better prepared for this. 2 people at my table had to send their food back due to lack of freshness and incorrect preparation. The 18% gratuity they add to your Bill its a joke.. The Service was not worth that tip...  I guess they figure, I'm getting a tip anyway so Service doesn't need to be good. Getting our Bill paid was a nightmare. We asked for separate checks.. They only allow 2 per table.. Well our group was 7 separate checks..  My portion of the Bill was only 21.00.. Having to pay a tip of nearly 50% for crappy Service just killed me!  Not due to the amount, but because that tip was not with the Service.. I'm giving 3 stars because my roll was good. Will I ever come back? Probably not.. My regular sushi place is bar none, hands down, number one in food and Service.",

For 4 rolls, an appetizer, a drink and two green teas, we spent $90, which was a total waste of money.  I left hungry, not wanting to spend another dollar in that place trying to find something I liked that actually tasted good.  I have eaten at other places not in a casino or on the strip and got better food, better tasting, bigger portions with less money.  I love sushi and eat it every time I can, but this visit was disgusting.  Even though the poki tacos were tasty, there was little fish on them.  I could have put all the fish on those tacos on a tablespoon.  We have even ordered  asian dishes in the cafe that were prepared in the asian restaurant that were equally as disgusting as this visit.  My son who loves asian food would not eat that dish.  Great service but the food isn't so wonderful.  I will never eat there again.  Save your money, go off-strip and find a better deal and better tasting food elsewhere.",

    "text": "I went to this place because I read all the great reviews. I may have gone on a bad night but it was truly awful and I would never go back, nor would I advise anyone else to go. To begin with, the sushi chef lied and tried to pass off something that was not what he said. When I sat down, I asked the chef if he had hamachi toro, or hamachi belly. He told me \"no,\" they did not. Five minutes later he miraculously appears with a hunk of fish and tells me, \"look, I found some hamachi toro!\" Really? Ok, I guess it could happen at 10:00 pm...He prepares it, hands it to me, I eat it...it was eatable, but it WASN'T TORO!! It was regular old hamachi and by old I mean tomorrow it will no longer be good except for deep fry. My son is a sushi chef. I know my toro!! It only went downhill from there. You would only ever expect salmon skin to be used in very small quantities, almost as a condiment. We ordered the \"double down salmon\" roll, believing by the description it was going to be some great salmon with a sprinkling of salmon skin. Wrong! It was a roll full--FULL--of crunchy, salty salmon skin, with two anemic, tasteless pieces of salmon, but mostly unripe avocado slices on top. Disgusting!! AND, we felt the chef KNEW this was distasteful as he and his fellow chefs were joking about the salmon skin as he was making it. Lastly, we ordered the \"sizzling tuna\" sashimi. \"Sizzling\" apparently is accomplished by passing a torch flame over the pieces until they are somewhat grey and lukewarm. I don't know how this place got such rave reviews, but if someone is going by those reviews as I did, you should know it isn't always so great.",

I had the Dynamite Green Mussels and the Miso Black Cod, both of which were fabulous!    Their wines by the glass selection was limited, but had a very nice sauvignon blanc that went great with both of these choices.    Service was vey attentive without being overly obtrusive, and fast.     I loved this so much, it will be on my agenda once again this week, and a permanent addition to the rounds for every trip (I am in LV about 6 times a year on business).",

Hub has never had, and after begging him to finally try, I almost had to slap his hands out of it.  He could not get enough.

One star off for that. The food was good. Happy hour specials were the way to go. Hamachi grilled collar was excellent along with the Chile spiced edamame which tasted more like black bean sauce. Had the poke bowl which was more than filling but wouldve appreciated less of an amount with better quality fish. When you want the convenience of eating Japanese food where you are staying then this fits the bill. Otherwise there are better places around.",

The prices were decent and the specialty drinks were really fun. However, I was a little disappointed in the food quality. My mother ordered the beef rice bowl which was essentially two vegetables and a mound of extremely sweet rice with kind of chewy beef. I ordered the Wagyu hamburger special, which was delicious and worth the price, but the beef I was served seemed almost imitation, and was spongy like a tofu substitute. I will say though that the eggplant fries were phenomenal and the rest of the burger, including the house made bun, was on point. Just wish the meat in both our meals was a little better quality.  Admittedly I had never ordered this type of beef before, but I'm pretty sure beef shouldn't be spongy. I should have stuck with sushi, which from what I could see looked amazing.",

Service was efficient, friendly, and helpful with menu recommendations. I like to think of myself as a \"Foodie\" and have no problem recommending this restaurant to my fellow \"Foodies\".

Ok so our neighbor has some trouble distiguishing between Asian food.  The ramen was too salty. The sushi platter was good though and fresh. The green tea was ok but when it was refilled, they refilled it with room temp tea! I love Japanese food but I probably won't go come back here and I don't think I can recommend this place neither.",

I ordered assorted sashimi, and it doesn't taste fresh at all. It's chewy. A good sashimi supposed to feel like it \"melts\" on your mouth.  Another failed dish: Spicy Tuna Bowl. Not authentic at all and they smothered it with thick layers of unappetizing mayonnaise-based sauce.  The okay dishes I tried were beef teriyaki bento box and tempura. The bento box was honestly, a good value. Comes with rice, pickled cucumbers, roasted kombucha, and salad. Good portions of food and taste was standard.  Service was meh. The hostess was your typical teenager with attitude.  The server was friendly at first, but then gets too friendly afterwards. I know she was just doing her job to give me recommendations, but she's pressuring me too much. She offered dessert for like three times and every time she ask, I would have to say 'no' multiple times.  The chef.. was too slow.. It wasn't even crowded. There were only about three tables out..  Bottom line.. If you have to eat here, just order the Bento Box sets. It's the only one that's worth it. If you want to order sushi, don't expect it to be fresh or in a good quality.",

Anyhow, we got our tickets and wanted a place to eat. Because we've never been here before, we decided to try it. And OMG, so glad that we did. The service was great. It was quick and the atmosphere, setting, mood was sooo nice that it really made my boyfriend and I forget that we were in a casino. It just really felt like a restaurant to us. We wanted a table where we could sit next to each other, but we chose the sushi bar instead because we didn't wanna cause the trouble of the hostess moving tables around and stuff for us. We didn't interact too much with the waiter or the sushi chefs, but when we did, they were so kind and totally recommended us to come back for their happy hour. The food was also really good. My boyfriend got the beef teriyaki and I got the chicken stir-fried noodles and it was not what we expected at all. It was more than what we expected. We thought it was just gonna be a mediocre type of place, but the price is totally reasonable for the food. Awesome experience! We will definitely be coming back here. Thanks!",

    "text": "Having tried just about all of the places in Vegas that serve oxtail soup, this place, by far, was the best. I used to come here once a week with the family. Went back last night after a month or so hiatus and was sadly disappointed. The flavor was still delicious but it seems the pricing went up from $10 to $12 and the serving size diminished drastically. We used to get served a larger bowl that contained all of the oxtail you could handle in one sitting; 5+ decently sized pieces. Now the bowl is smaller and all 4 orders of the oxtail soup we ordered contained 2-3 pieces each. What used to be a meal that had you bursting at the seams, now left you yearning for more and leaving South Point still hungry. The flavor was still great but the value is now gone. Sad to say, we will not be returning. A little bummed since we only live 2 miles away. I even ran into some friends at the restaurant whom we made the recommendation to and was embarrassed at the disappointment that was served.",

We went and try their late night happy hour and was VERY disappointed. We got 2 rolls of 777, 2 rolls of spicy tuna, and 1 of the Philadelphia. The tuna didn't look fresh (see pic), as you can tell by the color of the fish itself (not bright red but very pale).  The 777 roll was supposedly spicy soft shell crab but again (please see pic), the majority of the filling was fake crab/kani and not the soft shell crab. The small amount of crab that it was in there was mushy and not have the texture of freshly fried crab.   Quality was very low for a nice restaurant inside a (busy) casino. And I have to agree with my husband, people will check the restaurant out usually during happy hour. If they actually reduce the quality during happy hour, people are just not going to come back. Just saying.... (IMHO)",

    "text": "I've always thought that your host/hostess is a business' first impression.  Zenshin's hostess, Tara, should rethink her job choice.  My husband took me out to celebrate my birthday at Zenshin on Monday, Memorial Day.  When we got there we had to put our name on a list and were told it was a fifteen minute wait because they were cleaning tables.  Tara took my name and phone number and said it would be 15 minutes, maybe sooner.  So we walked around SouthPoint for a bit to find some lucky machines.  About 15 minutes later when I didn't receive a phone call I walked over to the hostess desk and noticed that she was seating people who had arrived after we did.  So I walked up to the podium to take a look at the list and saw names crossed out below ours.  I asked what was going on and all she said was, \"oh sorry, your table is ready\".  As we were walking toward the table I told her, we requested a booth.  She completely ignored me and put the menus on the table and walked away.  I decided I wasn't going to let her ruin my celebration.  Granted, the food is fantastic and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  While we were having lunch we noticed that a gentleman with a walker was waiting to be seated.  Tara, grabs a menu and walks over to the sushi bar and realized she couldn't seat him there and there wasn't a table ready.  She says to him, wait a few minutes while they get a table ready and just leaves him standing there and walks back to the podium.  Really? Is that how you treat customers?  What appalling treatment.  Love the food, but your hostess has to go.  She's going to tank your business.  What a shame.",

Only sea food I like is shrimp and sometimes a little bit of crab. He pointed out the cooked shrimp rolls. Honestly we tried almost all three!! Skip the garlic shrimp there isn't any garlic flavor really. But the crunchy roll and the deep fried California roll are the best. So yummy!!!   Rory kept coming over to check on us. So nice and we kept ordering something else lol. Next was the chicken katsu meal. Scott had the miso soup that came with it, we shared the salad and then shared the rice and katsu.  Really good!!! Everything we ordered he could eat because there wasn't any corn in it!!! Yay!!!! I had the island drink and he got the plum wine special. He liked them all except for the one with honey. Two managers came to our table to check on us. Such good service and they give you 10% off with the check in offer!!! Our bill was $65 for all that food!!!!  Next time he comes back to town we will head over here again!!!!",

We got a side of ginger but sheesh it should be standard to give that to every sushi customer right away.  and...they..are..SO...SLOW!!!! One sushi chef for the entire place??  Mexican roll - terrible. Not worth $12 an there was nothing inside except old, cold fried crab tempura. Gross. The 777 roll was just OK but it too was not worth $12.

The sukiyaki was decent the beef was tender and sliced thinly so how can it not be tough.  They give you a lot of cabbage a couple of mushrooms and some yam noodles.  Not too sweet like the way I like it but decent.   This place is probably better for happy hour which we did come during those times.   Expensive and not very good.",

The Crunch roll was a little plain, not crunchy and fell apart when I grabbed it with chopsticks. The lettuce wraps were delicious with little mushrooms mixed in with chicken and savory ponzu sauce. I'll work my way through the menu on my next visit, good first impression overall. Service was excellent. Managers walked by several times to make sure we were satisfied. Our glasses were always full. Plates were tactfully taken when emptied. And our server was polite, even when busy.",

    "text": "While at the South Point checking out the Glass & Bead Expo, I wanted to grab a quick lunch. I noticed the sign for Zenshin and it clicked that I had seen this under recently open businesses on Yelp. I made my way to the menu and was surprised at how extensive it is...they had anything from sushi to ramen on the menu. The prices seemed reasonable and they had bento boxes and lunch specials. I opted to give this place a try.  SERVICE: This is their weak point. Our server was nice, but not really on the ball. He was not well informed on the menu nor the drinks that they offer. When I received my bento box I had asked what the pickled vegetable was...he walked around asking three different people until he found out it was squash. Perhaps it was busy, or they're still working out the kinks, but this is their main area for improvement right now.  FOOD: Reasonably priced and delicious. The fish was fresh, the roll options vast and unique. They had several lunch specials and I really enjoyed my bento box. I had couple of classic rolls such as cucumber roll and california which were priced accordingly between $5-6 per roll. I had one speciality roll Tuna Mango Passion and that was $13. Their speciality rolls were between $10 - 13. I generally don't like fruit on food that is suppose to be savory, but this roll was very well executed. I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki bento box. It came with miso soup, salad, steamed rice, pickled squash, and a generous piece of salmon in light teriyaki sauce. This was a great deal for $11.  AMBIANCE: This is an open restaurant inside of a casino. It is definitely noisy. The decor is very sleek and modern, and the restaurant is spacious so personal space even at the sushi bar isn't an issue.",

The calamari (which is called something good else in Japananse) were the legs of squid and larger than you might expect from traditional calamari.

    "text": "********************* 1244 **********************       I've followed Chef CHRIS RECAIDO on Instagram for sometimes now www.Instagram/C_REC, Have dined at his former place SENSEI sushi inside the Marriott Hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii before. I told myself, I will visit him at Zenshin Asian Restaurant at the South Point Hotel in Las Vegas at some point.      I come to Vegas average 6 times a year, some trip like the CES one last month, I stayed for 8 days, I finally got to visit Chef Chris Ricaido. All I can say is WOW, I'm impressed.     If you look at their website, no where mentioned his name besides the owner and the executive chef, or their website is so dated, they even misspell the grape varietal. However, be sure to call in advance, to make sure chef Chris is in, you will be in for a real treat.     Zenshin Asian Restaurant is spacious, you don't have that feel of a cozy Japanese restaurant. It's big and almost feels as you walk into a cafeteria. However, the oval sushi bar, makes it perfect for foodies, you can watch to chef and cooks do all their magic in front of you. Don't the look and feel of Zenshin discourage you.      Their HAPPY HOUR is amazing, such a great deal on cocktails and not-so-small-bites:  - Strawberry Bangkok - $6  - Rising Sun - $6  - Beers & wine - $2-$3  - Hamachi Kama - $6 Grilled Yellowtail Collar & Ponzu Sauce, the CHEAPEST in Las Vegas! Order it!  - Teriyaki Beef Sliders or Soft Shell Crab Cake Sliders - $6  - Karaage Chicken - $4.50      Now the regular menu:  - Jalapeno Yellowtail - Hamachi, Jalapeno, Shiso, Tobiko & Truffle Ponzu - order this!  - Sizzlin' Tuna - Sizzled with Grape Seed Oil, Ginger, Chives & Truffled Soy - delish  - Teriyaki Beef - Marinated in Soy, Ginger, Garlic & Simply Grilled, simply falvorful.  - Uni with caviar, toro, tai, hamachi were all fresh and high quality fish.  - Cucumber roll with tuna, hamachi, salmon was so delicious, fresh, and it was my FAV roll, off-the-menu, but if request on a week day, chef will do it for you.      I have met many chefs via Instagram and Twitter, Chef Chris Ricaido is 1 of the most genuine chefs, he's humbled, kind, young and very cute too!  And I probably enjoy his company a lot more because he's from Hawaii where my half broski was born and raised, what not to love about him :-)     Service was very attentive, the price point is so CHEAP compare to everything on the main strip or San Francisco Bay Area. This is why I love to come to Vegas for food. TRUST ME, take a short cab drive to the South Point Hotel to check out Zenshin, it's a perfect sushi spot for a big group or for a family on budget.       Follow chef Chris Ricaido and you will see: www.Instagram/C_REC",

I never thought twice about this restaurant before because of the location, which is inside of the Southpoint but when we saw the positive reviews we decided to try it. This will be our new go to local sushi favorite, at least for a while! Everything was very fresh and they have unique rolls. I'm a big fan of cilantro on top of sushi rolls and they had a few to choose from which sold me immediately. The rolls were sized correctly, most sushi places love to make the rolls so big that you can't fit it inside your mouth but that's not the case here. They have good happy hour specials and they're open late which is a plus. They also have a 10% off yelp check in which is always a perk.",

Uncooked egg and inedible pork? Don't think so.  After he checked with the manager they took off a whopping 40%.  Will be my last time coming here.  Thanks.",

Our server was very fast, attentive and very kind! The food runners and host were also very friendly.   I ordered the eggplant parmesan fires which were super good. Perfectly crispy and not greasy and quite addicting! I also got a few sushi rolls which were pretty good and standard for Vegas.   Sadly my Miso Ramen, was really really bad :/ Being Japanese and a ramen fanatic and having experienced many kinds of ramen in Japan and America, I kinda have an idea of how it should kinda taste. Basically the broth was like they skimmed all the fat and grease from a fryer and put it in my bowl. It had no flavor and no evidence of miso.. The chashu pork was tender and the noodles were cooked perfect, however I could not taste anything due to my grease broth. It was also supposed to come with tamago (egg) which it did not.   I let our server know of the nasty grease ramen and she quickly took it away and apologized. I had already eaten half the ramen (I was super hungry and didn't want to be rude) but I felt quite sick and ran to the bathroom and puked. I was sick for the next two days... :(   Though it was not the fault of the serving staff and I don't blame them, I do however blame who ever made the broth and called it \"miso broth.\" Certainly not a good representation of how real miso ramen should taste, so hopefully they can raise the bar and learn from a mistake.   I will maybe try this place again since the service and the other food items were good... but... I really hate puking so we shall see..",

The edamame was amazing and tasteful, I recommend the Thai chili version. Chicken lettuce wraps were the favorite merely because i was looking for a light appetizer. I was disappointed with the Crunch Roll. Felt it was bland and could of been better if the shrimp had a better crunch texture along with a more fresh taste. Because this is a place for sushi and my lack of impression on the Crunch Roll, I could not find myself to rate this a 4 star.",

It really is as good as sushi place that I have been to in Vegas or back home in Los Angeles. Just to sweeten the deal, it's inexpensive. Ridiculously inexpensive.  We shared the sushi sampler, an extra order of CA Rolls and had alcoholic drinks...and left stuffed for around forty dollars. The fish was fresh and the soy sauce is house made. It was really delicious.  The staff was extremely personable, with both our server and sushi chef chatting with us and making sure that we were happy. I felt like we were getting a lot of personal attention, like being a regular at a favorite bar.   Zenshin was good enough that I am sure on future trips, we would make the effort to drive over, even if we were staying on the Strip.",

A few dishes I recommend is the oxtail curry with rice and can last you up to a few days to finish since it is so massive. All their sashimi dishes are wonderful and fresh, you cant go wrong with the eggplant fries or shisito peppers.

The sushi roll I ordered looked as if they were trying to discourage us from coming during happy hour. A 5-year old could have done a better job. I was SMH. Well, it worked.

The Japanese noodles had an Indian type twist which was interesting.   The lettuce wraps were boring.    The garlic fried chicken was fried perfectly. We paid an up charge for breast meat. The garlic sauce was almost non existent. I could barely taste the sauce and had no sense of garlic at all.   Maybe if I had been drunk like my friend who recommended this place I would have liked the food.",

A few minutes later  a manager was passing by and asked me the same question and he got the same reply from me.  His response was quite different from the waitress.   He looked at me like I had just said \"nice suit\".  He just walked away with a smile.  Nice customer service.  Don't know what I was expecting but not that.

I'm not sure, but the service was so awful in so many ways. The waitress consistently forgot we were a party of 7 and only brought 5 of everything (plates, silverware, etc). She even forgot to take the orders of 2 of the people present!   We were so shocked by what was going on that we thought for certain we were being pranked by a TV show...but no such luck.  One of the appetizers we ordered arrived at the END of our meal. The timing of all the food was just awful. The bill rung up incorrectly to top it all off.   Thankfully the food was good. I didn't expect much of the sushi but it was fairly good. And the bites I had of everyone's food around me was pleasant as well. If you get the edamame, try the chili garlic flavor (or whatever the non-regular flavor is), it's surprisingly delicious!",

We got there around 5:40pm and still had 20 minutes left on the HH menu!   And what's great is that the HH menu is available in the regular dining area. SCORE!  So... we had $3 Asahi draft beers, veggie pizza (more like a flatbread that was surprisingly good), potstickers, sweet thai chili chicken and a chicken garlic bowl. Both chicken dishes were great.  I was surprised.  I figured it was just ... ya know... plain chicken with sauce... nope... both were juicy and had wonderful flavor. I think we liked the sweet thai chili chicken the best.  It had the whole sweet / hot thing going on.  Service was nice, and the food came out as it was ready... not all at once which really worked for us so that we could nibble here and there.  Since it was Monday... it wasn't crowded. I bet on the weekends it is tho.  We will be back... especially for HH!",

I sat right at the bar with my mom and so the chef asked us directly what we wanted to eat. My mom told him what we wanted and he made it right away for us. Getting that experience right at the bar is always cool and it didn't get any less cool for us. The waitress took our order and got us our chicken lettuce wraps. Those were really good, the chicken tastes like it was cooked over an open fire and that is what made these taste so amazing. The rolls were average compared to a lot of the different places around Vegas where you can order sushi, but you can't be picky when it comes to happy hour, you get what you pay for, but I still enjoyed it a lot with my mom. The manager was personally walking around making sure everything was going great for all the guests and I really appreciate that gesture. I will definitely be coming back after having such a great experience here!",

Our server was attentive and friendly, he seemed a bit timid at first but soon enough relaxed. He did recommend a few items which we did try and I'll admit they were good suggestions.   Might stop by again if I'm in the Southpoint.",

    "text": "I wish I would have paid the extra $15 to Uber to an actual Japanese fusion restaurant... where to begin.. their mixed drinks are good.   But the food.. first of all... the Thai Shrimp Cevice.. it was 6 pieces of small frozen shrimp in a plastic martini glass with Mai Ploy sweet chili sauce and sprouts sprinkled on top with two orange slices and stale chips. And the waitress even said it was really good, that's the atrocious part. No tomatoes as listed in the ceviche as well, not even any onion as it is normally made regardless of regional variation, so how was that ceviche at all? For $6 I could have assembled that on my own from a quick trip to walmart. Second.. the takoyaki... adequate amounts of sauce but there was medium sized rubbery chunks of octo in the dumpling.... not minced or diced at all so it was an unpleasant surprise to say the least. Third, the tofu was.... flavorless... even though it was in a cute broth. The broth lacked any flavor and I ended up having to put soy sauce *cringe* on the cubes of tofu... extremely displeased with how this food turned out, everything screams lazy or uninformed about how the items should actually be made.   Customer service was decent at best. The food came out quickly and the drinks were good. Can't expect too much from a casino restaurant but for the prices they should actually make the menu items as listed and not a sad imitation. Was not worth $30 happy hour prices. And the servings are small (HH given). Wish I had never spent my money here. If you have never had any Japanese (fusion) food or think California rolls are bomb then this is the spot for you because it'll be just fine. If you actually know what you are eating then buyer beware. Will only be returning for HH drinks.",

    "text": "Zenshin, advertised as an Asian restaurant, is a Japanese sushi bar located in a far corner of the South Point hotel. Upon entry, you're greeted by many enthusiastic hosts, and even the servers passing by will also welcome you.   The interior is very minimal, which is the popular style in Japan, however, I found that the establishment might have some identity issues.   As I first mentioned, Zenshin is advertised as Asian, but it's a majority Japanese. Their choice of decoration include the lucky new years cat, Buddha, and metal traditional Chinese garments, which are all things usually seen in a Chinese restaurant. There are a few things Japanese, such as the samurai chest piece, and the choice of wood on the sushi bar, but the vibe I got was more Chinese than Japanese.   As for the staff, I found that they mainly left their tables to the more experienced staff members, while the younger staff remained at the host stand and the cashier stand. The waiters seemed to have worked there for a long time from their thorough understanding of the menu. I asked one of the host for the name of the roll that I was just given and she was unsure, which left me to believe that maybe everyone who goes into training start off as a host.   The server that I had was very knowledgeable and when I asked for recommendations, it was very comforting finding out that he didn't point to the most expensive dish on the menu, which is usually the norm of many restaurants.   I ended up getting the miso soup, gyazo, and the Silverado, all at the recommendations of my server.   Starting with the miso, it was made with mushrooms, green onions, tofu, and seaweed. The broth was a lot more white than what I usually have and it was made with a lot more filling than most miso soups, but it was absolutely delicious. There was a lot of flavor and the textures really pulled together. The tofu was there but in tiny bits, which I really enjoyed.   The Silverado came next, which is a bit out of order considering my appetizer didn't come for another 15 minutes. The Silverado is a shrimp tempura unagi roll, covered with spicy crab, salmon, and plated on eel sauce. I have to say..the roll was definitely more sweet than spicy. It did start falling apart a little when I tried to pick it up, but it tasted really delicious.   The gyazo, which is a Japanese potsticker, came last. It was served with Chinese black vinegar, which I found to be a bit overwhelming mixed with the already flavored pork and vegetable of the gyazo. It wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be because I don't honestly believe they were made fresh, and chances of it being bought in package is more likely.   All in all, I did enjoy the service and the food, but I do believe they need to put more thought into their identity. Having a majority Japanese menu but a mixed Asian atmosphere doesn't really work.",

It really reminded me of supermarket sushi. Don't ask me how I know. Sometimes when the craving hits, the craving hits. Lol..   Then the scallop had a weird taste. Not a fan.   8 second bull ride Roll.. not worth the $16. The garnishes up top made it taste like dirty grass. The asparagus so mushy and soggy that I forgot it was even there, it just all mushed in together. Very disappointing.   Would probably never try again. Not worth it.  Odd though since I'm a frequent visitor of Island Sushi & Grill, which is another one of their restaurants I guess? They have better sushi and food imo.",

I have had miso and tonkatsu ramen before in other restaurants. What we got looked and tasted like tonkatsu due to its white color and creamy like texture. We still ate it since its ramen. It tasted like normal ramen...nothing special in particular. Afterwards we got our 007 which looks and tastes like a capterpillar roll. So all in all..our experience was so so. Spent close to $80.",

We read the reviews and it's has a lot of really good ones.   We decided to check it out before our movie. We showed up around 9ish and walked up to the hostess stand. The hostess was on her phone .. Maybe it was an important business call she was on so we didn't want to interrupt her. We waited and waited until I cleared my throat and at that time she put her phone down and stood there. We had to ask if there were a table available for 2 people. The place was decently busy so we didn't mind waiting for something to open up. She said it would be a 20 to 25 minute wait. As soon as she said that 2 people got up and a table opened up. We asked if that table was available and she said \"it will still be a 20 minute wait\" .. I work in the customer service industry and this place tops the cake. I could only assume they had to go to Walmart and pick up new cleaning supplies to wipe down this table.   The hostess was very cold and not a attentive. Let's just say we ate next door at the burger place and it was just as bad.  What a shame because we really like going to the South Point for the movie theater.",

I had a bowl w/brown rice and my husband had a beef bowl w/brown rice as well both w/teriyaki  The  sauce they used was so good and mixed well with all ingredients to deliever a very fresh and hearty flavor. It wasn't too heavy and it was the perfect amount. Waitstaff was nice and did their job well. As we were leaving it started to pick up which made sense, we must have lucked out during a down time. If your staying at the hotel, don't hesitate to try it. Prices are very reasonable and they have sake and fresh sushi as well.",

The strawberry Bangkok drink was really good along with the yellowtail collar. Nothing stood out for me, tasted like an Americanized sushi bar. I've had fresher fish elsewhere and the rolls were lacking flavor. My boyfriend really liked the Cajun pizza, their dough was great. We spent about $80 and I still was not full or satisfied.",

    "text": "2 days late but after my experience at tgi Fridays I wanted to post a positive review for a change instead of a rant. First off this restaurant is in a casino so expect a bit of a wait to get seated during dining or late hours. I had the teriyaki steak while my parents had the oxtail soup which is usually their favorite . But while the portion was big the meat was not the usual fall off the bone they are used to , the Teri steak on the other hand was decent but it was the restaurant style where the sauce is separate from the meat itself as a dip, I should have inquired to which way they served it before asking for it to be well done , an error on my part. Also as a side I got a panko style pork belly , 2 small pieces with average taste , IMHO not worth the price. The greeter was friendly as well as the restaurant but due to the average oxtail soup and skewers, it's hard to say it is worth the price charged . Unfortunately there are limited choices within the hotel that serve rice so it is still better than the buffet rice.  I had eaten earlier in the day.",

    "text": "I thought this place was fantastic. I went with 3 other people and we were seated in a large booth. The atmosphere was upscale but not froufrou or intimidating. The restaurant was busy but not noisy or crowded.   We were recommended the oxtail curry which wasn't on the menu but were told it would be added to it in the near future. The oxtail was awesome! It was so tender and flavorful. We also started with the Dynamite Green Mussels...simply delicious!  As far as sushi, we had 5 different rolls: Cajun Albacore, 777, Candy Cane, Blazin Tuna, and Salmon Skin. All were good, but I think the 777 was my favorite. It's a spicy soft shell crab roll, topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce. The Cajun Albacore sashimi was super good too. It has a great kick for those who like spicy.  I'm a BIG stickler about service and I must say the service here was great. The waiter was friendly and helpful and prompt. He checked in on us sevrel times and we didn't have to wait around for him to take care of the bill.   Overall, my experience where was awesome and I cannot wait to eat here again. I will make it a point to go here the next time I'm in town.",

Definitely order eggplant fries. Try the oxtail curry bowl. Order poke if you love poke. Chicken karaage is great. Tempura ice cream is awesome.

(I agree the elevator music is cheesy, but I think it's coming from the casino.) The service was good and friendly.  I had the $5 lunch crunch roll which was yummy and well-portioned. I made the mistake of ordering the shogun burger (who orders a burger at a sushi place?, never again). The eggplant fries were really good. The burger had redeeming qualities, but it didn't appeal to me. I ate 2 bites and left 90% of it on the plate. I mentioned this, but no compensation was offered. *** update! Before I gumshoes my review, the server took the burger off my check, and still gave me the 10% yelp check in discount. ****  Conclusion: The crunch roll, service, my love for sushi, and other yelp reviews mean that I will have lunch here again while I am at the South Point Resort this week. I'll stick with traditional fare and let you know how it goes!",

    "text": "Ok first of all please note I am not a sushi fan so to be fair if I could rate it 2 1/2 stars I would. We went here as a family birthday dinner only one or two of us liked this place, everyone else was trying not to roll their eyes.  Guess which side I was on?    First off we wanted to change tables and they made this big deal out of it even though the place was empty. Trying to say the back room as closed so they had to ask the manager, yet there were people back there already. So that annoyed me. And that was only beginning.    Not being sushi groupies three of us figured we would just get the teriyaki chicken bowl, sounds easy. Well the waitress was either making pretend We wanted the more expensive dinner version, or I was simply not clear but we got the dinner one which was more money ( also asked for less sauce and got sold up to with cut chicken that isn't teriyaki for a 2.00 upcharge). And the Miso soup was disgusting and no one wanted it. The plates had a small amount of cheap white rice with some seaweed embellishment on it, two very small cold squash like vegetables, a spring mix style salad and the chicken which was dry as hell. My Cousin who doesn't eat much laughed saying we'd be hungry later. ( He's psychic!)   They got some eel, and sushi or fish platter that was served on a huge mound of ice. there wasn't much there for the money. It looked fresh though.  We also got ribs, they were good, we ordered another lot and the next round were tough. Also got eggplant French fries these are very good but be warned eggplant in general really sucks up the grease so if that makes you wonky don't order em'.  The drinks looked expensive but I am not an expert on that since I don't drink. My cousin got one mixed drink and it was 12.00.   The wait staff were pretty pushy, they were friendly and attentive but obviously trying to pad or bring up the bill at any chance they got. ( which made me wonder about the \"miscommunication\" with the teriyaki bowl thing) She suggested dessert so many times I was ready to scream by the end of the meal \" No we don't want any more of your lousy food\".    There is a bar, and it looked nice with nice decor and seating.  They do NOT take points, I think you can get comped but they are considered separate from Southpoint and don't take any points on your casino card.  The plates, food presentation, the atmosphere, decor is not bad, This place is trying very hard to be classy or unique so kudos to them on that. I think people who like slick places and drinking and appetizer or sushi eating might love it here. I would not suggest for family dining as the menu is limited and the portions weren't too big. At least have won ton soup for people who don't like miso! In fairness some meals were not overpriced. You can eat here for 10 or less if so inclined to scan the menu for that price range, not everything was expensive. The bill was over 200 for 5 people and we got about 30 bucks worth of food. A few of us did not even order a drink.   Honestly this place just strunk me as a tourist trap all the way, there were no lines at all when we went and it was dinner time. The Steak burger place next door had a huge line, and I thought to myself you'd think people would get sick of waiting and just try the new Zenshin place but no one was buying into it. Smart folk.",

    "text": "Small rolls, hefty prices, good fish, and slow service.  I stay at South Point every year, and I was happy to see a sushi place open up.  It's not very busy yet, so we were able to sit down fairly quickly, but that's the last time anything happened in a timely fashion.   Everyone we talked to had pretty much the same thing to say, \"It's not my favorite place for sushi (which is XXXX), but it's here.\"  The menu: It's got a good selection of sushi rolls and nigiri... but not much else.  Very little in the soup and noodles section, and for those who like a lot of tastes, there's only the 2 combinations... one sushi, one sashimi.  The food: The fish was certainly as fresh as you can get in Las Vegas.  The tako with the cucumber salad was just excellent.  The special rolls are small, especially for 12-14 bucks a pop.   Go somewhere else for your teri-bowl, too.. it was teri-ble.  The service: Here's where they really need some work.  The staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know much about how long things take.   We sat down, ordered inside 15 minutes or so, then proceeded to wait.  20 minutes later my wife's teriyaki beef bowl arrived.  15 minutes later her cucumber salad \"appetizer\" arrived.  15 minutes later my two special rolls arrived.   50 minutes from order to arrival... with no warning from the staff except apologies as it kept taking longer and longer... shows a complete lack of interest in setting expectations with the customer.  Another example of the same.  My wife doesn't eat sushi, so she asked about the teri-bowls.  \"They're both great!\" the waitress says, so we order the beef bowl.  It comes, but is very fatty and the meat was tough to chew, which we then mentioned to the waitress.  \"I do like the chicken better,\" she then adds.  Well, where was THAT when we were ordering?!  Finally, we ask for the check... which doesn't have the comps we mentioned both in line and at the time of ordering.  So we wait again for her to come back with a modified check... which only has one of the two comps on it.. again mentioned before.   I walk up to the register to get it fixed, and have the remainder billed to the room, which the cashier does without giving me a chance to tip.   Total time from first check to walking out... 10 minutes.  Will the place get better?  I have to assume so.  They're starting from a good food and presentation base, but it's pretty obvious they've got some kinks in the preparation line, as well as some staff to train better.",

But what was truly 5, no, 10-star worthy was the incomparable service. I was treated with such kindness by my waitress and the manager, Bronson, that it totally turned my trip around. Thank you to the incredible staff. Nothing goes with great sushi better than attentive and generous service. I'll definitely be back, and I hope all of you Yelpers stop by, too.",

The menu prices were very competitively low compared to other restaurants in Vegas and the Happy Hour was even BETTER! I did not expect much from the food since the cost usually reflects the quality but I was very pleasantly surprised. The food was incredible and well worth a $25 cab ride from the Cosmopolitan. This sushi was better than any other sushi I got directly on the strip. I will definitely visit again.",

Eggplant Fries were the decisive winner. Get these now!    The calimari tempura was ok. The pork belly was good, but with the sweet and smoky sauce and sour pickle you lose the pork belly goodness. The chicken teriyaki bowl was excellent. Very moist because they used dark meat. The ton katsu was also very moist and crispy. Didn't try the sushi, but looked like they had some worthwhile selections.   Overall, good experience. Nice staff, not overly loud, decent food. Get the eggplant fries to go if you're not interested in the rest. They were that good!",
