Great place to watch a game. The menu was awesome! Over 10 different taco options to mix and match and also a giant burrito and more. They have a large beer menu, however when we visited, they were all out of Mexican draft beer, which we were in the mood for, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Friendly staff, good food, at reasonable prices. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good taco bar.",

They have a wide beer selection from breweries all over on draft with a supplemental bottled list that is sure to hit anyone's tastes or prefences.  They have a full bar so if beer isn't your thing,  no worries.   That leads us to the tacos, there is such a variety of different amazing tacos that we found ourselves hard pressed not to order way too many.   Rather then having plates the tacos are are alacart. The al pastor taco was my favorite, but nothing we tried was short of a 4 to 5 star taco.  If you havent tried this place you have to get in here!! The service was amazing, Emily was so sweet and attentive helping us navigate through the many tacos.  Will be bringing our friends here!!",

This time, hostess was wonderful, server was attentive (enough) and the food was still incredible! I'm so glad this experience made up for the terrible service I had the first time I came here, because the food is just too good!   One of the owners, Carlos is absolutely wonderful and his beer knowledge is impressive. If you don't have a palate for beer, like me, you should really ask him what to order, if he's around. I was so surprised that I found two beers I LOVE, 1) Tangerine Haze (IPA)  and 2) Elephant Heart Brett.   It's a fun atmosphere and you should really bring a friend, or two or three and come have some eats and laughs!",

The dishes themselves were the perfect size too, not too big, not too small, and everything flavored just right.

Beer Battered Avocado -beer battered avocado, slaw, cilantro-lime dressing, pico you had me at avocado and I stayed for the cilantro-line dressing! Super tasty. Veggi Empanada - roasted poblanos, caramelized onions, mushroom, corn, vegan cream cheese, chipotle dressing.  Freaking bomb-tasty goodness. On top of the hella reasonable prices they also have quite the beer selection...tacos and beer..yeah I should have expected that. But it's not just beer - the cocktail selection included a prickly pear mule that was quite refreshing.   Our server, Alyssa, was on it!  She knew the menu well and was great with recommendations as well as the 2 minute, 2 bite rule. Definitely coming back on my next trip to Vegas.  Kinda bummed we don't have one of these in Reno.",

I've only had one bad experience: I called to order for take out and the lady answered with \"thanks for calling Tacos and Beer please hold..\" so I held....and held...and held until I started hearing the hosts chatting back and forth \"yeah she's covering my saturday\" blah blah blah. So she had forgot she had me on hold. I was on hold for 20 minutes until I hung up. Unfortunately when I hung up and called back, the call wouldn't go through because the phone was off the hook and obviously the host wasn't realizing any time soon that she had someone on the line. I ended up having to go in to order for take out, then wait for my food. The phone was still off the hook when I got there. love the food though!!",

You'd be a fool to skip it. Lengua is always a crowd pleaser. Pork al Pastor was one that I wasn't sure would work, but it definitely did. It's marinated pork taco with avocado cream / pineapple / and achiote. I did not and still don't have a great understanding of achiote. All I know is that, it helped make this taco taste amazing. Not sure you can go wrong with any of the tacos there.  &  Beer: I had the DirtWolf (Imperial IPA) by Victory Brewing and 1000 IPA by Mikkeller. Both pack a hell of a punch. The 1000 IPA was not as bitter as you would think and it wonderfully warms your soul. Nothing helps also warm that soul too than some fantastic Mexican food. Mexican soul food. Nothing better.",

Fun, relaxed atmosphere with a hipster vibe. We sat outside on the patio. It seemed like most others outside with us had been there before. Upon being seated, we were given a binder with beer and cocktail options. There were about 2 dozen tacos on the menu. We ordered the carne asada, beer battered avocado, jackfruit, puerco verde, beef barbacoa, and the crunchy. All were perfectly delicious! The Crunchy was surprisingly the standout for us. Mainly, because it was like a gourmet Taco Bell Taco Supreme, for lack of better description. It was delicious! And it had mashed potatoes under the beef! This place is amazing! We're only here for a few days, but considering going back!",

We got a bunch of chips & salsa, guacamole, queso and flautas for the table and those disappeared. The guacamole is top notch with lots of avocado and the queso is probably the best I've had. I'm not sure what all is in it but it has a great flavor.  The beer selection is one of the best I've seen in town. They've got about 20 beers on tap and a lot more bottles. The beers on tap aren't your average beers either...they are hard-to-find microbrews and Belgians. The people at Tacos & Beer seem to know a thing or two about beer so they pick out the good stuff.  As for the tacos, I only got 2 since I was full from all the appetizers and beer but they were both touchdowns. I got the carne asada (a classic - and it was delicious) and the fish tacos. The fish taco was probably my favorite actually: big chunks of fish, tasty and crunchy veggies and a big dollop of guac on top.  Definitely recommend if you're visiting or a local.",

She ordered carne and chicken asada tacos and loved them as well. The atmosphere was also very comforting and down to earth.

Good selection of saison, ipa, Pilsner, wit. I had a St Somewhere saison and my wife had DFH Romantic Chemistry. Then I found the bottle fridge in the back. They have a bottle list, sure it's nice, but this fridge is like a gold mine. They had a bunch of rare beers/semi-whales including 5 variants of Eclipse, BCBS and one bottle of FW Anniversary Ale that this guy paid (maybe too much) for. It was totally worth it. Now, on to the food....it's delicious thank God. I can justify coming here and spending exorbitant amounts of money on beer bc the tacos are awesome. They have lengua which is my requirement to call yourself a legit taco place, and it is tender, well seasoned and ample portioned served with a nice green sauce. The Puerco Verde is redonkulous, everyone at the table ended up ordering one or a second helping. They also have cochinita pibil, one of my faves, and it was also delicious. They have fish and veggies tacos also. It seems like 4-5 tacos is good if you don't eat sides or apps. We got salsa and it's really good also. And wouldn't you know it they even have good dessert (dammit!). We were so pleased with everything else we threw caution to the wind and tried the desserts, there's only three, churros, choco tacos, and flan. The churros were my favorite, super fresh, crispy/chewy. God now I wanna go back...",

Average sized off strip restaurant with an open air patio cooled with misters to tone down the 100 deg Vegas nights. Inside is a walk up bar and table seating. Good music mix creates a lively atmosphere.   Beer - Good mix of craft and mainstream Brews both on tap and bottle. And no taco place is complete without a list of margaritas.   Tacos - Wow! Great selection of individually ordered tacos for 3-4$. And the flavour was amazing. Tried the grilled fish and carnitas and both were stuffed with fresh toppings.   Only knock was the service was a bit slow. Waited 15min to place drink order but looked like the waiter was swamped. He seemed like he was working hard but maybe a bit light of staff that night. Glad we had patience though as the food made up for it.  Do yourself a favour and get off strip and get some Tacos and Beer....  FYI... Apparently the Techno Taco Tuesday is packed and loud. Great to people watch but expect to wait and get ready for noise",

We had a couple with mashed potatoes in them.  Who woulda thought to put mashed potatoes in tacos but they were delicious.  Make sure you order the corn salad.  My girlfriend asked for the recipe, it was that good.  Our server was quick and attentive.  He was helpful with my beer options as well.  Manuel, the manager, talked with us and was fantastic.

    "text": "I wish I could give this place a good review because the food is delicous, but unfortunately thats about the only good thing there.   Ive been here three times now. Every time the order is always wrong. I'm very specific about ordering the barbacoa tacos with no cheese and no crema. The first time I went I ordered three but they brought out only one and it took forever so i decided to just not wait another 20 minutes for two tacos. The second occasion they had crema on it still when i ordered it to specficailly not to. People have food allergies so I dont understand why this is taken so lightly to get an order correct. The third occasion being last night I went with a party of 4 and they got our whole order wrong.  First lets talk about service, there's not much to it that is tasteful. Someone came by and dropped off chips and salsa that we didnt request for.  We asked if it was complimentary but they didnt say anything and ended up charging us for it on the bill She wasn't our server but every time she came by to pick up plates she kept on giving us attitude and rude glares. Our server took 15 minutes just to take our drink order and left in such a rush to not even ask if we wanted to order food. He came by 4 times before finally asking if we wanted to order. It isnt our job as a a customer to have to say hey, we're ready to place our order.  This is a rule of thumb in any restaurant - serve your tables with a proper greeting and ask what we would like to drink and order in timely and professional manner. As usual, I ordered my barbacoa tacos with no crema and cheese, three to be exact and I orderd a fourth taco being chicken. Two of my barbaco came out as the crunchy taco which is a different meat and those tacos still had crema and cheese on it. Now i'm left with missing two tacos again having to wait AGAIN for them to be made properly.The upsetting part was that the server repeated the order? So maybe it's kitchen staff who don't know how to read the quanity of how many tacos to make?  I'm never coming back to this place again. It's not that hard to get an order correct and the service doesn't make up for giving this place another shot.  Also, this isn't really a place to bring your kids unless you want them to get a free show. The host wears a really skimpy romper out with no bra. NO BRA! We are not in a nightclub people. This is a dine in restaurant. Where is the uniform? My poor son had to keep looking over at her because her boobs were popping out of her chest. This place is so dissapointing from all the other good yelp reviews.",

I keep giving them another chance but they seriously need to get it together with their horrible service. I timed it on my phone and it took 10 min before a server came over and that was after I flagged him down. He rudely told me to hold on. Exactly 20 min after being here we finally got our drinks. Food was fantastic. But once again service was terrible. They should have more servers on if they can't give good service",

The waiter wasn't exactly polite, he forgot our appetizers, and didn't even acknowledge it. A place with beer in the title should have a lot of beer--yet the *binder* of drinks handed to us had maybe two pages (out of like six), mostly cans, and mostly not even available. Tacos were mediocre at best. And the churros were basically stale carnival fare.   Bottom line: If you want cheap mediocre tacos, a surprisingly limited beer list, and you don't care about customer service, then this is the place for you.",

No napkins or utensils given despite seeing them provide for the others. I'm not sure if this treatment is because I am here alone but it's unacceptable. And the entire time I have been writing this review no one asked me if I needed help or my check.   The food was ok. Ordered: Beer batter avodaco; the Veggie and the Jackfruit Carnita tacos.

He did bug out to who knows where as we were waiting to pay our bill, but by that point I was already picking out which stickers to buy.  Beers: They got em! Itemized by style, with all the deets, and if you know me, I found an IPA that I've yet to swallow, and remedied that soon after ordering.  We had the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. KILLER!!! The tacos were each a different instantiation of awesomeness. We ordered 5 and bit a bit at each. I've had a better deep-fried avo taco (in TX), but that's just dumb to mention cuz damn! We tried the puerco verde with the chicharones, which was incredible, and along with the shrimp taco, our only representatives of anything resembling traditional Mexican fare. There was some out of control veggie taco with cactus and black beans and mushrooms and, you know, mashed potatoes... yup. The mashed potatoes are also featured on their \"crunchy\" taco, which is just a regular crunchy taco, but with mashed potatoes, cuz ya know, mashed potatoes... Neato tidbit: the ceiling lighting fixtures are re-purposed old Mexican Santo candles like you can buy at corner groceries. We sat right under St. Anthony.  Dope.",

I ordered the carne asada which comes in a house made corn tortilla that has a good thickness too it, but the meat was charred to the point it tasted burnt so it really ruined the flavor for me.  I also ordered one Barbacoa with onions and again the corn tortilla, the meat was tender and chewy but the taste was similar to BBQ from a bottle you get from the local store . The last taco I ordered was the Crunchy Chicken taco this was a hard shell, grilled chicken, lettuce, cheese, and potatoes. This was a hearty good taco but not something to write home to mama about.  The tacos are average and convenient",

It is served with a red and a green salsa; the green is a bit milder than the red and they were both fresh tasting. The tacos themselves were good. I had the carne asada and the carnitas. The carnitas were good, but the meat itself was a bit bland. It was topped with a crumble of chicharones, which was a good offset to the tender meat. The carne asada had very tender and flavorful beef and it was tasty. Between the two tacos, I preferred the carne asada.   What I did like about the tacos here was that they were medium sized tacos and not your tiny, street taco size. Overall their tacos were good.",

The tacos were good, don't get me wrong but all of these people's reviews saying they are the best in town are kidding themselves.  I love the variety and even love that they have so many vegan options (even though I am a staunch meat eater).  I love the variety of unique appetizers but the flavor seemed to be lacking on everything and I made sure to try a lot.  I had 6 different tacos and 2 appetizers and a passion fruit margarita which seemed so fake tasting, way too sugary.    I would go back and try this place again but probably not for a bit.  I feel like there of plenty of other places that you can have a better taco at in the valley.  Maybe the atmosphere won't be as nice but it will be cheaper and tastier.    I was so full though after eating all of that that I unfortunately did not get to try their desserts which I REALLY wanted to try.  I guess that gives me an excuse to go back!",

I was feeling adventurous and immediately regretted it after the first bite.  Nothing was wrong with it, my taste buds just did not agree.  Everything else was amazing.  Tortilla soup was very hearty, almost filled me up! I was bummed about the Pacifico.  Our server....Franco?  Very nice man, he recommended another beer for my michelada...starts with a B; Jesus my memory is sh*t today.  This is going to need some editing. Favorite taco was probably the beer battered fish.

My issue was that a good portion of our order was incorrect. I asked for 3 sides of green salsa and got some red flavorless stuff. Props for labelling it the flautas sauce, but fail on being what I asked for. Luckily I'm saving them for leftovers. The ceviche was good but I felt like it was weirdly chunky. If everything had been cut finer, it would have been even better.   The carne asada fries were a total fail. My boyfriend asked for no beans or guac and both were on there. Cheese wasn't shredded so getting extra created just pockets I'd melted cheese.   Frustrating because the receipt showed exactly what we wanted but they didn't seem to pay any attention.",

Luis was my server and his service made my experience pretty sad. His service is very slow I think he needs improvement on multi tasking and approaching his tables more often. Also he ended up getting me the wrong stout beer after drinking it which made my experience even worse. Overall love the place but staff needs work on smiling and being happy all around.",

But then it took a while for our tacos to be served.   We got chips and salsa along with the jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. Both were good, I kind of wish we tried the guac too.  The tacos were just ok. I got three; the al pastor, carne asada and the crunchy. Out of all three the crunchy was by far the best and most unique. It had meat, mashed potatoes, sour cream, tomato and cheese. The other two were just ok, I would prefer taco y taco.  I recommend if you come here order the tacos that are out of the ordinary because they taste better than the normal taco staples.",

They always have music going with a pretty big crowd inside and outside that seems to be consistent during late hours. One of my favorite things to start with is the chips and guacamole or the QUESO FUNDIDO which is my favorite appetizer by far. Some of my favorite tacos are the Carne Asada, Crunchy, Fish, Chorizo and Barbacoa. The enchiladas, burritos, and nachos are all very good. The margaritas are good with quite a few to choose from. As always one of my favorite things about this place is that they are open late! So if you haven't had a chance to try Tacos & Beer do yourself a favor and get in there.  Adios",

Great selection of eclectic American/Canadian beers on tap (seasonal, regional, funky), and crazy good gastro-pubby tacos and sides. Sweet vibe and rockin early 2000s indie rock...perfect for alone time lunch or conversation. Thanks for actually saving my sanity, Tacos&Beer! Great service, too!",

I wanted to order 3 tacos from the recommendations he gave me but ended up having one carne asada and one chicken and let me tell you I got super full even though I usually can eat. Very rich with guacamole, cheese, beans, pico de gallo and salsa and the tortillas were just amazing .. I honestly would have had more if I could.. I definitely recommend it and will come back on Tuesday. Tacos are only $2,50 each ..",

    "text": "I'm a passionate foodie native to San Diego, California and happen to have a significant other who is Mexican and Columbian. So trust me when I say we KNOW good tacos. But this place didn't have \"good tacos.\" I mean, they didn't even have \"great tacos.\" In fact, when we first heard of Tacos and Beer our expectations for an authentic Mexican dish were sub par, and we definitely weren't prepared for what was about to happen in that restaurant off the strip. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager, and offered a margarita. Ok, Brownie point #1. We were promptly seated amongst fellow hungry patrons and handed a menu to gaze over the vast options of appetizers, tacos, and beer. I quickly discussed the options with my date and we decided the only way to be sufficiently satisfied was try every single taco. So we did. The waiters didn't miss a beat! To our amazement taco after taco began to emerge from the kitchen and onto our table. We both grabbed one and immediately made mouth to taco contact.  What happened in those next few moments may only be understood by other Tacos and Beer diners. My taste buds were sensually awoken with powerful flavors of tenderly marinated carne asada layered between the savory caresses of cheese. My salivating mouth discovered many new tastes and textures with every second that passed.  I gazed up at my co-taco entrepreneur and realized he too was going through the same experience.  Our ravenous eyes locked and tacitly acknowledged that our trip for a simple bite rapidly became a life altering experience.  We exchanged tacos, allowing the other to orally grasp the new combination. More explosive tastes erupted from each bite, putting every other hand made taco I've ever had at home, or in Mexico to shame.  After sufficiently divulging each morsel (in some cases twice), we concluded that 1) to say that the were merely \"great tacos\" would be committing a great disservice...2) We were compelled to try dessert.  My sweet tooth landed on the churros, and his on the chocolate taco. Like with tacos in SD, I thought I was a veteran churro eater. I mean they sell a bag of 30sec old churro in the border crossing line...but as with the tacos, my palette was put to shame.  As I finished devouring the last of my devine, sugary stick of perfection, I became remorseful that our time at Tacos and Beer was coming to an end. All in all, the service was absolutely amazing,  and the food..well. The food was nothing short of mind boggling, mouth-gasming goodness that we will definitely be coming back for next trip to Vegas!",

Nice mix of craft beers on tap, including some locals, and the wide array of tacos available were mind-blowing. Frank was great in offering up suggestions of his favorites (and tips on which hot sauce paired well with which tacos). Amazingly good was the beer-battered avocado taco. What's especially nice is that they have several clearly labeled vegan options.",

The salsas they serve with chips are a little underwhelming, but I liked the avacado one the best.  Approximately 20 beers on tap from all around, makes it easy to find something to enjoy.   I'll be heading back whenever I have a taco craving that needs a fix.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch after picking up our Rock N Roll marathon packets.  We each ordered 3 tacos and also sampled an empanada.  I had the Jackfruit taco, Deep fried avocado taco and the beef Barbacoa taco which happens to be listed in the order of my preference! Haha. The jackfruit taco was simply the most delicious taco with a little bit of a kick!  The other 2 were good but nothing spectacular.  My brother had the crispy taco, avocado taco and the tinga.  That was his order of preference as well.  He didn't care for the tinga and absolutely loved the crispy.  It is just a regular beef taco but he said it was delicious. My mom has a beer battered fish taco and chicken empanada.  The fish taco was good but didn't particularly care for the empanada.    Tacos are a pretty decent sized street taco.  I was definitely full with 3 however I don't eat much anyhow.  Ordered a beer but was told the tap was empty until later that evening so had to order something else which I didn't really like that much.  Prices were ok by Vegas standards.  Between $3-$4 a taco!  Decor is nice with the Mexican rosary candles handing from the ceiling as their lighting source.  Very cool!  Will be back to sample the other taco offerings!!",

Tacos & Beer service:  Excellent service throughout our visit.  Our server was so on it with checking keeping the beers fresh and suggesting ones to try.  On a packed Saturday night, the kitchen got our tacos to us pretty quickly.  Tacos & Beer, Tacos:  They have so many different tacos (20+?) on the menu and I love it!  You can order them individually to personalize your own taco combo.  I went with the Carne Asada, Beef barcoa, and the Crunchy.  My favorite was the Crunchy.  It was a traditional taco (ground beef,lettuce, pico, sour cream, hot sauce, cheddar, etc) but was very tasty.  The Carne asada was very good but the Beef Barcoa was a little too salty for me.  All in all, this was a great taco experience.  Tacos & Beer Ambiance:  The ceiling is adorned with individual candle lights and makes for a very cool look.  A Cheech and Chong mural is showcased at the bar and the there church influenced murals throughout the building.  Lots of dark wood matched up with this make for a very attractive dining area.    This place gets really busy and I understand why as they deliver in Service and their food. There will definitely be future visits as I'm looking to sample more tacos, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

We all ordered 2-4 tacos each. I myself had more beer than I should have, which they have a pretty extensive and awesome craft beer list, and so ultimately forgot specifically what I liked about the tacos. Oh, lengua! I think that's how you spell it. I'm used to the texture being chewy, and full of flavor. I prefer it to be that way, similar to burnt ends. BUT, this was done slow cooker style. It was soft and the texture freaked me out. It was a me thing, I just don't like tofu textured protein, unless it's actually tofu. The Barbacoa (sp?) was AMAZING. As it always is.   Overall, I enjoyed the flavors, they were fresh. I love cilantro! The proteins were all done pretty well. We had a vegetarian at the table, who loved the jackfruit other vegetarian options!  Because our table was too much to handle, I ran up to the bar to order drinks. Our sever was just too overwhelmed with us. But the busser/food runner was awesome! Constantly refilling water, clearing tables and gave me napkins! Too bad he wasn't the server.   Awesome, up beat atmosphere. Great for a fun/hype crowd. Just a short drive away from the strip.",

Once, as I arrived and was still in my car and the second time as I was leaving - BE ALERT**  I finally got around to trying this place after hearing the name tossed around in popular conversation amongst several of my friends.   First of all, the ambience is pretty cool. The lights are all repurposed devotional candles and the artwork is all from all different movies and significant people of hispanic culture. It's all dimly lit with a great vibe! I went here about 9pm on a Monday, so it was pretty chill.   Unfortunately, I was just underwhelmed with the food. The guacamole didn't have much of a flavor and I don't even remember the salsa, although I tried it.   I got the Rajas con Crema, the Chorizo and the Beer Battered Avocado tacos. The server didn't tell me which was which, so I just had to guess. It took me two bites to figure out I was eating the avocado taco first and, despite being \"beer battered,\" there the avocado was pretty limp and tasteless. The white sauce on top was flavorful, but I felt the taco would've been better if there was more of it. The Rajas con Crema was good but the Chorizo was my favorite, all around. None of them blew my mind.  One thing I wish I had known was that all the tacos can come in hard shells (although I believe the soft ones are made to order.) The waiter never asked us if we had a preference as, so far as I can tell, the option was not stated on the menu.   We didn't order any drinks here, so I can only comment on half of the namesake items, and it probably would be fun to come on Tuesday with friends, but I wouldn't go out of my way. They are open until 1-2am depending on the night, so that is a perk!",

You can order the tacos individual and they pair up well with a cup of tortilla soup which is delicious. The chips and salsa are not free. I'm sure they make a killing charging for 20 tortilla chips and a few tables spoons of salsa! People still order them though including myself lol .  The place is decorated nicely it has a modern Mexican hipster vibe to it and the lady making the fresh tortillas in the corner adds an extra little spice to the place.",

Everything I've had, I've enjoyed and is very very tasty. My favorite Mexican in Vegas hands down for a party in your mouth where all flavors are coming. Nom nom nom nom",

On this Friday 9pm visit, the place was packed (inside and out) with every seat filled, under the dimly lit, hanging electric candle lights. The place is very clean and tidy, decorative and stylish, all fitting for a return visit.   While getting service wasn't an issue, it seemed the kind crew was understaffed on this busy night. I saw maybe two waitresses in a room that probably packs 60+. I think even the bussers helped refill waters and chips.   BEER: I went for something new and different with the Gose Gone Wild Tijuana ($9 in an 12oz. sniffer glass). A bit sweet then immediately sour. Not my thing so I fell back to a safe beer, Corona, to compliment the tacos.   3 TACOS: BBQ Beef ($3.70), Lengua ($3.70), Grilled Fish ($4.15). Damn, they were all bomb with BBQ Beef being favorite - it just had an awesome marinade to it. I only had three on this evening - there's probably a dozen more to try.   Great food. Will come again to try new beers and tacos. On a busy night, it's a good spot to get in and get out. But I think the experience could be better on a slower night.",

But if you are looking for exceptionally tasty \"mexican enough\" food, this is the spot to be. Their taco selection is extensive, I'm a huge fan of their al pastor and baja fish. Puerco verde is delicious as well. Tons of beers on tap, hip interior design, and great overall ambiance.   The only draw back is that this place is a tad pricey for what you get (each taco and side is ordered individually). If you have an average appetite, it's no big deal. You really do get the quality that you pay for. However, if you have a bigger appetite you, might be a bit less satisfied with what you'll spend to fill up.

They were amply filled. One corn tortilla for each taco which kind if annoyed me because anyone knows you should always use two to support the filling so it doesn't all fall apart which is what it did. Not sure if this is normal or they decided to cheap their guests because the majority are tourists. Couldn't tell how the drinks were but they did have an extensive cocktail, beer and wine list. An ok spot if your looking for cheap eats but I've had better at fast food taco shops around the city.",

The reasons for the 4 star rating are: the side of rice was extremely salty, and more so because my wife asked about her taco being spicy and was assured it wasn't and the salsa would be placed on the side. Although the salsa was on the side the chicken season was pretty spicy. Would think the server would have mentioned that.",

    "text": "I was in here more than a month ago, but after traveling cross country with my husband, I finally had the time to write a review about my favorite taco and craft beer place that contends with every place in this country. We came here on a Wednesday night. The hostesses knew what they were doing, which if you eat out as much as we do, you know the best indication of quality service starts with hostesses who know what they are doing.   We got seated outside because it was a great afternoon outside, and the patio was where we wanted to enjoy some amazing tacos. The tacos were authentic. Our server, Alan, knew what he was talking about. Every question we asked him, he answered us with a knowledgeable answer, and when he didn't really know questions about the wine selection, he asked the manager, Armando, who came up to us with a professional manner and answered our questions with amazing knowledge. We could tell he wasn't  hired from the outside. He was a server who worked his butt off to be a knowledgeable manager who helps his servers, bartenders, and bussers without question. Seriously, he was bussing tables and helping the restaurant without being judgemental.   We are from San Francisco, which our server Alan was also from, so when we are in Vegas eating at Tacos & Beer, we will be asking to be served by Alan, who has impressive customer service skills, and Jordan, who made the most amazing cocktails...seriously, try the Hicubus Mezcal, best cocktail I've ever drank.",

Staff is always super friendly and they come around to refill your water often,  ambiance has a buzz (especially on Techno Taco Tuesday, where they have a live DJ spinning all night) place is open late night which is huge, and the lighting is awesome with all of the votive candles re-purposed as lights. Bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed Jalapenos are a must and are to die for. Flan is very rich and perfect sized. Alberto served me the other night and he was very attentive and fast with taking care of everything. This place needs to multiply soon.",

We've been accustomed to thinking that only a 4-5 star restaurant is acceptable but please remember that 3-stars in YELP means \"A-OK\" which in my book, means I would return.  Came in Sunday afternoon for a quick bite to eat at the recommendation of a friend. Within our group of four, none of us had been there before but were all happy with the food.   We had a couple of instances where our server may have gotten overwhelmed. We were her first table, but quickly picked up 3-5 more tables and that could have crossed her threshold of comfort. She was VERY sweet and we did not pressure her. From our table, three of us had been bartenders/servers so although we were understanding, our expectations were higher.   Our guacamole was asked to be served without pumpkin seeds, it came with. We were given an additional guacamole as compensation. One of our tacos was asked to be served without the traditional flour tortilla, it came with the flour tortilla. There were just a few instances where our very specific dietary requests were not met.   Regardless, the food was pretty decent. I was not impressed with their chicken taco but was very happy with the pork (had pineapple in it too). For the bigger eater, the bill can run a bit high than you might expect but you can tell this is absolutely a great spot for happy hour.  We will be back!",

The hostess ended up being our waitress too, and she was unfriendly from the moment we entered the door. The bartender looked like he was offering much better service but unfortunately we were seated in the main dining room and experienced the slow and unfriendly service instead.   I ordered a soft drink & it literally took between 5-10 minutes. She wanted to take our order as soon as we sat down but since it was our first visit we needed a moment with the menu. It took another almost 10 minutes for her to return. It wasn't as it they were slammed or too busy, just bad service.  That being said, the food was really good & I would be willing to give it another shot sometime, maybe for happy hour.",

    "text": "I came here on a Tuesday night for Techno Taco Tuesdays. Their complimentary chips and salsa were good. Their salsa is not spicy. It's the slushy, mild kind. Their tacos were $2 that night. Their tacos normally are $3-$4 each. I already had an early dinner so only got two tacos- beef adobada and the veggie potato cheese taco. The tacos are small.  They have a very impressive craft beer selection. However, they need to know their beers. My husband ordered an IPA and one of the Belgian beers for the second round. The second beer tasted exactly like the first beer. When we asked the waiter, he said it was the right order. Uh, OK? My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.  I came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.  I would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!",

At 7:50pm, I receive a call from the hostess letting me know that they will not be honoring my reservation. When I asked why, she said \"well someone should've let you know earlier. Someone was supposed to call you, but it's Taco Tuesday so we don't take reservations.\" She couldn't be bothered to even apologize for the inconvenience. I informed her that obviously someone had taken my reservation and I had a large party. She said that if I got there by 8:15, they would put us on the wait list now and have us seated then. So I rushed down there, and when I arrived, the same hostess then told me that it would be another half hour wait. We waited for an hour. The hostess sends me the text letting us know that our table is ready, so all 15 of us head in. She then lets us know that the table isn't really ready yet, but she just wanted us to \"be ready so we wouldn't lose our t.\" So now there are 15 people clogging up their entry way and blocking the only exit for an additional 5 minutes. They finally seat us, and the tacos were amazing as always. Our server was great! I truly love the tacos here.  I wish they had better management and hosting staff. Truly horrendous. No matter how much I love the serving staff and the food, my party of 15 will never eat here again.",

Their Guacamole, corn salad, and cilantro lime rice are great too.",

Lackluster place with no zest to it, place is always empty and it feels like there's only 5 tables in the whole place.  They need to improve the vibe for this joint, there is no appeal for customers to visit this place.  Salsas are stale, tacos are not good and they're expensive.   The only good thing is the beer selection which doesn't make out for the fact that you will get bad service and bad food.  Overall I would visit several other taco places before you go and take a look at this dump. There's a great variety of places in town that kill this place.  Avoid at all costs!!!!",

They were amazing.  The rice was flavored with cilantro (my favorite).  My sister's wedding cake was a huge churro cake.  The churros served to the guests were HOT and soft with raspberry/chocolate dipping sauce.  I have only had the hard chewy churros from warmers at theme parks.  Never again.  I don't know if I will ever find a place with such delicious churros near home.",

The place is very clean and not too crazy. Good environment to have a business meeting and dinner. The guacamole is delish. So fresh and chunky. The margarita can be frozen or on the rocks. Good flavor choices. Tables are setup well and gives everyone ample room. Not too overcrowded. The place is located in a small strip mall and has plenty of parking outside. There is also outdoor seating but not with a great view.  I don't think you'll need a reservation but if you suspect the area to be busy, be safe and call ahead",

Cool that they offer vegan and vegetarian options as well. Bathrooms were well stocked and clean as was the restaurant itself.  I always  appreciate well lit parking lots too. The only bummer was our server seemed a bit absent from our first time experience. This was a Monday dinner service with many open tables inside. I'll be back as the food quality exceeded that of the service, and look forward to doing so.",

I have been disappointed by taco places all across the country but this place hit the spot and knocked it out of the park each and every way. The decor is metal, the customer service is solid. They have plenty of seating inside and out. Their menu is expansive. For a place that advertises tacos and beers, they still offer a few other options like quesadillas and burritos but as you'd imagine, they focus on tacos and they do it spectacularly. I tried the 8 tacos and honestly could have kept eating and eating and eating. I could eat through their whole menu and probably not be disappointed. They also have vegan and vegetarian ( and pescatarian options as well) if need be. Definitely worth a pit stop, you won't be disappointed!!!",

And, Victor, the Colombian bartender was not only adorable, but knowledgeable, friendly and a superb mixologist.  What MORE could you possibly ask for???

    "text": "Craving Mexican food I knew that something had to be close especially with the wonderful array of choices here. The Envy Hotel that I am staying out recommend Ed this location, besides me already being aware of it. I have always wanted to try Tacos and Beer, so here I am. I know in my own experiences that tacos go especially well with beer. This establishment is no different, since their tacos are amazing. The style and feel of the restaurant is so laid back bar type cool. I am surprised that they don't have pool tables, this seems to be what they lack. One can dream of course. This is a sit down restaurant with very amazing murals and paintings surrounding the guest. The service is stellar. The music is upbeat and in English which is something I like since it is old school rock from the 90s and it takes me back to the old days.   The alcohol choices that they provide from the bar are exceptional. Their prices for example on mezcal vary from $11-40. So it is nice to see the various variations of alcohol choices from low to high; and the in between too. I ordered Coors Light since I wanted to taste how the beer would pair with their carne asada tacos. The soft tortilla shells on the tacos are larger than that of street tacos and they taste so good. These tacos melt in your mouth in essence and pair well with beer.  I am a real big fan of green chili's so as an appetizer I tried the green chili's with cheese and held the chili sauce. The chili sauce is hot but I feel that it ruins the cheese filled green chili's. Dessert was something that the twins wanted so I ordered them the dessert tacos. These dessert tacos are waffle style cones shaped like taco shells with chocolate on it and vanilla ice cream inside . On top of the ice cream is chocolate and Carmel sauce . These dessert tacos pair well with beer too. What a wonderful restaurant to come and eat great Mexican and have a moving experience with beer.",

I'm still exploring the whole menu but I always get the shrimp taco. Most places will plop 3-4 whole shrimp in there but here, they slice up the shrimp so the taco is easier to bite, and it's sauteed w/guajillo chili, topped w/cilantro-lime slaw, pico, guac, and chili crema on a flour tortilla.  Service is always fast and the place is always busy but I've never had to wait for a table.  I'm not really into beer, but I discovered tonight that they have a whole craft cocktail menu and half of it is seasonal specialties!  It was hard to decide, but I settled on one called purple haze (pictured). Gin/lemon juice/lavender/ginger beer/mint leaves and a couple other things.  Very unique and tasty.",

The bartender made sure to take care of us very well. There was also a second bartender Jesus who was very helpful and even recommended a beer to try.  I ordered three tacos and boy was that enough! The tortillas are hand made and a very decent size. I chose three different meats and they were all AMAZING! Being Mexican I didn't really expect much from the food here but I was wrong! The flavor is very rich and similar to authentic Mexican meat.  My fiance ordered there burrito with barbacoa and he absolutely devoured it!  We also had some very yummy micheladas!  Definitely will be coming back !",

    "text": "Went here for a business lunch but it's very casual. The name of the place just made me laugh, very straightforward :) Place was busy but we were seated quickly and we had a large group. Menu had an extensive selection of tacos. We started off with some appetizers, the guacamole and ceviche. The guac was delicious. The ceviche was good, but even though I love everything in it, together it's not my thing.  Now for the tacos! These are typical hand or street tacos, so you'll want to order at least two to four. I had the Carne Asada, Chicken Asada and Shrimp Tacos. Every single one was amazing, with the shrimp being one of my all time favorite shrimp tacos.  Unfortunately, this business lunch did not include any beer, so I can't comment on that aspect other than to say the beer list was shorter than I expect, but looked well rounded. Until next time!",

So many taco options even vegetarian options. Who'd thought putting mashed potato on a taco could be so awesome. Got the Pork al Pastor/BBQ Chicken/& Shrimp tacos. I understand now why this place is super packed I was shocked we didn't have to wait and they sat us immediately",

From Chicago, so was expecting real house music. Although, music wasn't bad. The food and atmosphere, more than made up for it. Went back , three nights in a row. The staff was great! Armando, the manager, treated us like we were VIP. Thanks for a great time. Can't wait to come back. Check out Sunday night. More like real house music!",

Our server poured a bear into a glass partly filled with water (had dried it after being rinsed out, I'm guessing), was rude pretty much every time he asked questions (for example, when he asked if we wanted something to drink, I told him I hadn't yet looked at the menu. He then immediately got annoyed and said \"so, what do you want to drink?\"  Not sure what part of \"I hadn't looked at the menu yet\" he missed). Salsa showed up after we had already eaten a couple of tacos, no explanation of what the salsa were, and when asking us if we wanted anything else, all he did was start to ask the question and before we could say anything (or swallow the food we were eating) he just turned his back and walked away as he finished the question.   Just a whole host of other small, bad customer service moves which when added up made for a really disappointing experience. Server clearly didn't want to be there and was not interested in anything. Really hope management there gives a bit of a refresher on basic customer service training. Will definitely steer people clear of this place. There are plenty of other Mexican places around with food that's just as good but have far better service.",

They missed out on a group that would have spent over $100 because they tried to shake down their customers at the door. I explained that we just wanted dinner and weren't trying to go to their outdoor club thing, but they said everyone must pay. Good thing there were other food options in the plaza.",

    "text": "As I sit in the parking lot in front of tacos and beer, I am floored by the level of professionalism and courtesy when I had a small complaint about an order I placed for to go food. I am so pleasantly surprised with the prompt responses from leadership, the pleasant service, and the delicious food. I am particularly picky, and ordered food without salsa, and the mistake was so small I almost didn't realize that there was salsa on the tacos. I called that night and the manager I spoke with was awesome and she offered to replace the food. Unfortunately I am a terrible customer and didn't come the night that I told her I would. Tonight, I called and spoke to Carlos, the manager at this location for tonight. He was polite and respectful and got my order prepared for me before I even arrived. He came out and greeted me himself, apologize for the mistake, and made me feel very welcome if I were to come back. He also upgraded all of my tacos to carne Asada instead of just giving me the chicken, for free. He also took the extra step to separate the cheese so it wouldn't get soggy on my way home. I am so happy and feel like I could eat here every night for the rest of my life and get this high level of service every time. This place is a total five star and definitely a place you should check out if you're a tourist or a local like myself. Also they have really cool shirts and I can't wait to buy one. Thanks tacos and beer, thanks Carlos, and thank you yelp for letting me share this awesome experience. I will be back over and over and over. Totally worth the drive from my house, and I will be sure to tote along my coworkers with me whenever I come in. -Rachel",

It just did NOT match the food... it felt like high school music, but maybe they put the music on purpose because they wanted us to leave. We did arrive right at last call...   Besides that, the food was amazing. I did have a taco that did not have meat, and that was not my fav, but it wasn't bad haha.   I had been here before and remembering i didn't like the flan, so i had the churros instead this time around, and it was YUMMMMMMYYYYY.   So, i definitely do recommend this place if all you care about is food, and beers (because duh, tacos and beers) but I kinda picky about music...   About the service... i believed they hated us when we first walked in. Probably thought we were just going to take our sweet time. But my husband and i have worked restaurants on the strip, so we understand last call. We were just hungry.... but they finally realized when we payed the check in like 30 mins from entering",

I sat at the bar and began looking at a menu, but my attention was diverted to the giant board with a list of beers available on draft. This place is a craft beer drinkers heaven. The board covers a lot of beer styles from bitter pale ales to tart and sour ales. Really great beer selection here. They also have a cooler with bottles beers for in-house consumption. Although a bit pricey, most were all from respectable breweries.  There's quite a bit of tacos to choose from. Whether you're a carnivore, vegetarian or pescatarian, they have it all covered. I ended up ordering the flautas because they will always hold a special place in my heart.  The food was good and the beer was even better. I am definitely returning to keep up with the draft beer changes and to try all the tacos!",

They have great guacamole. Everyone enjoyed their tacos. The ceviche was just ok. About 6 shrimp, with red bell pepper, 2 pieces mandarin orange and some sliced fresh jalapenos. I've had better. I will definitely go back and stick with the tacos, a great variety which all taste great.",

The servers were super attentive and nice, the service was efficient and we were all perfectly taken care of. The place was packed and despite that, we had a great experience all around. Key tip here: the best decision of the night was making a reservation because there was quite a wait when we got there for people without one.  The menu of taco items was vast and almost overwhelming, but some of us asked the servers for recommendations and everyone loved their selections. The tacos are large, and one would have sufficed, but I enjoyed trying two different ones just for the heck of it. If I could have tried several more, I would have, they all looked so good!  We got chips and queso as well as chips and salsa and both were delicious.  I would definitely go back.",

When we had asked for Tito's on the rocks with lemon we got limes instead. I got an ice full of ice in my water and my friend had to get up and get the napkins I had asked for several minutes ago. We were sitting in the patio which was nice since the weather last night was perfect but felt we were ignored too. It was packed inside with a table or two open and the several bar stools available. Their choco taco is hard to eat and not what I had expected. It was two scoops of a gelato sort of ice cream but a watery cheap version with a slight flavor of horchata. The flavor was interesting the texture not. Then it's shell was a hard crunchy waffle and it's choco Hershey chocolate syrup. Not the choco taco you get down in Cali's neighborhood ice cream truck so disappointed.",

    "text": "THE TACOS: Several options to choose from, including 3 vegetarian versions! Unfortunately I found the lengua plain and greasy, but the grilled fish taco was fairly good. Unfortunately it was wrapped in a waxy, store-bought flour tortilla. Prices are a little high, ~$3-4/per with a 50-cent discount on Taco Tuesdays. If you're going to hype up your tacos and price them higher than nearby taquerias, at least buy the good tortillas to use even if you don't make them in house (which isn't that hard).  THE BEER: Sat at the bar for my visit. Selection looks good, but my server/bartender wasn't particularly knowledgeable, friendly, or service-oriented. There were several friendly ladies behind the bar but the one serving patrons seemed to be the least suited for it. She barely made eye contact, didn't engage in any conversation, and didn't seem to want to be there. Perhaps she was having an off day.  THE REST: Interesting setup, lively atmosphere. The surprise hit of the night was the taco salad with grilled chicken, which had a lot of different, fresh ingredients (toasted pumpkin seeds, a tasty cilantro-ranch, some citrus!) and a low price tag. They have some live music events and are really pushing their Nacho House Sundays.",

The variety of tacos they have is fantastic, but the over all taste for they ones I ordered was nothing amazing. It also might be that I'm not a huge taco person to begin with so that probably isn't helping.  I ordered the Carne  Asada, Shrimp, Chicken Tinga, and Pineapple taco. Pineapple being the best without a doubt.  The service/staff was excellent and so was the restaurant itself. They have a great selection of beer and a good sized menu of tacos. This is also an excellent place for vegetarians as they have a number of veg tacos.   Tacos range from $3-4 each. I say that so you know this isn't your cheap 0.50 cent taco place. The price might be a little high but for the quality of ingredients and customization its expected.",

We are so glad we did! As we pulled up, our Lyft driver said.....This place is awesome! We were seated right away and within a minute, our server Frank came to take our drink order. My husband chatted with him about beer and Frank came back with samples that he thought he might like. Great choices. I had a Cadillac margarita. Both the beer and the cocktail were delicious. Also you have choices in margarita size. Pretty cool. We ordered the queso fundido and the guacamole. Both were tasty but I could have just eaten the queso. Make sure to dump in the jalapenos...huge portion and delicious. Next tacos....black bean and pineapple, chorizo, beer battered avocado, crunchy beef, Baja shrimp, and the mushroom veggie. All were unique and well done. Definitely try the the avocado and the chorizo! Homemade corn tortillas! Everything was served quickly so Frank managed the courses very well. Though we were stuffed who can refuse hot churros with chocolate sauce and horchata ice cream. Creamy inside, crunchy outside.  Kudos to the great staff that helped Frank keep things moving. Super responsive and nice. Thanks Frank for the great service and conversation. Go now! This place is awesome and we will come back.",

If you don't mind watered -down salsa or guacamole that taste like its from the grocery store, then go ahead and go in. This place is nothing but a trendy over-priced hipster place. If you just want a place to meet friends off the strip then  it's ok but if you're looking for real Mexican food, this place is not it.",

Everything else tasted basically the same & very average. The sour and acidic sauce overpowered the taste of everything else & gave us a horrible heartburn afterwards. Our food server never checked on our table & we had to wait 25 minutes for our check. I saw he was Overwhelmed with too many tables. Meanwhile the hostess at the podium was just standing there and chatting with her friends and doing absolutely nothing. She could've totally see us waiting for a check and help but she even didn't bother to leave the podium and see what's going on.",

A place that serves tacos has a Latin night? It turns out there was a band who began laying in as we were leaving (which means we could have say in the dining room). The coctel was more like canned clams, canned crab, strangely halved shrimp in a ketchup sauce. The tacos were way overpriced, as was the beer. For the price of the carne asada, I expected some flavor and no gristle, but the most flavor I got from one was when I bit into the hidden lime. If you want some authentic Mexican food, get farther away from the strip and go somewhere that has actual recipes.",

    "text": "The selection of tacos is huge and includes a number of vegetarian and even vegan options. The deep fried avocado taco was great.  The beer selection is vast especially when considering the bottle and can lists. They have a lot of specialty large bottles (750ml). So of them are on sale so if you're a fringe beer drinker, you might hit the jackpot here as I did in finding an out-of-production Berliner Weisse from Bruery Terreux.  The place isn't huge but clearly has no shortage of business. We arrived just before 6pm and still had to take a table on the patio. But there were ample heaters which made things quite comfortable even outside in January.  My only complaint here would be the coordination of service. It took a long time for the server to initially visit our table. After that, we got our appetizer before our beer. Before we half through the chips and guac, here comes our tacos. So now on a small square high table we have water glasses, beer glasses and cans/bottels, chips and guac, refill bottle of water, and four tacos holder trays. It took concieous effort just not to knock something off of the table while trying to eat. I'm not sure if they were out of napkins this night or what, but after receiveing tacos we had no napkins. When we asked for them, the server was almost confused as to why we had requested them. He returned with only four cocktail napkins. So we shortly asked for more, this time receiving another stack of about four cocktail napkins. Weird. It's a taco place. There should be a big stack of full size napkins on the table once the tacos arrive.",

We mentioned to the server that our friend has a shellfish allergy. Pretty standard allergy. The server seemed flustered and said our friend would have to sign a waiver. This is ridiculous! If a restaurant does not know the protocol when it comes to allergies how are they still open? No restaurant should require you to sign a waiver because of an allergy. The server was not very professional and did not smile once. He seemed to hate being there, which didn't ruin our time, we just felt bad for him. We found out which tacos our friend couldn't have after the server went back and forth to the kitchen a few times. He didn't seem to know how the food was made, which is embarrassing for him and the management for not training their staff thoroughly. We found out that they fry the fish in the same oil they put everything else in, which is not only gross because the other stuff tastes fishy, but it could potentially hurt someone very badly if they weren't aware of this.   Again the tacos are delicious, but if you have an allergy make the management aware.",

Rajas Con Crema $2.70 Taste way better than it looks. Seasoned well and the cheese was delightful.

Twice with my husband to be before our wedding - once on my bachelorette night and then the day after our wedding with my family.  Everyone agreed - great spot. I tried the carne, chicken, and beer battered avocado tacos. Now I'm plain so I only get the meat and cheese and In the avocado case just beer battered avocado and cheese.  I kept going back to the beer battered avocado though. By my last visit this was the only taco I ordered x3. So good.  When we got back from our honeymoon I wanted to come here one more time before going home and we ALMOST made the 30 minute drive but we were too jet lagged.  That's how yummy it is though.  They are served in cute little perfect taco holders!!  Oh yea the nachos - hubby raving about them it's almost like they were baked the chips were golden crispy and be sure to add chicken!  Also my sister loved her taco salad and best friend had the jalapeno margarita and it was spicy enough for her spicy self.   Oh And the churros!!! Served with warm chocolate sauce oh melt in your mouth!!!   They have happy hour I think every day but Taco Tuesday (that's another deal in itself).  Anyways very happy with this place and convenient location to the strip with an easy parking lot!!",

Our waiter was very attentive, even with a huge party at the tables next to us, plus he recommended we get the happy hour pitcher and saved us some money!!! I will definitely be back soon!",

Some of you will understand when I say that the tortillas tasted clean! The meat is flavorful and tender. Carlos the GM is very engaging and friendly and willing to explain the place to you. I had the privilege of eating one of their empanadas. Sooo good. I really hope they continue to grow and expand. Hopefully to Savannah Georgia.",

Excellent service from staff with recommendations on the menu.  And finally the best tacos we ever had anywhere.  The corn tortillas were hand made, pressed and grilled and then handed to finishing chef who stuffs your tacos.  We had the amazing Fried, breaded and crunchy Baja fish, crunchy chicken, roasted pork and chorizo tacos, all spectacular.  And our cheese stuffed bacon wrapped jalapenos were spot on sitting top a delicious chipotle enchilada sauce.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "So for months my cousin, Tracy Lee, had been posting pictures of her food from this restaurant so when I was finally in town and had the opportunity to finally grab some lunch with Tracy, she mentioned this place and I was like YES! I love me some tacos.   First of all, the decor and feel of the restaurant is what I'd like to call \"modern taco chic.\" Cool vibes and fun colors. If Paisley happens to be the host, give him a high five because he is so wonderful and friendly.   Their menu and beer selection is one of a kind. I'm loving this whole trend of gourmet tacos and this place does it so right. Tracy took charge of ordering the appetizers because she knows what's up. She went with the chips and guacamole with extra pomegranate seeds...possibly my new favorite thing to put in my mouth. Next she ordered the corn salad with a side of rice, which once you get them, mix them together! The corn salad is their take on Mexican street corn which we all know to be fabulous. Next I ordered two tacos, the Al Pastor and the Baja Fish. It was SO difficult to just chose two, they all looked mouth-watering. The Baja Fish was very yummy and big! However, I wish I would have followed Tracy's suit by ordering two Al Pastor tacos because OH. MY. GOSH. Easily the BEST Al Pastor taco I've ever had the pleasure of eating.   They have an extensive list of craft beers on draught which will pair wonderfully with any of the food on their menu. We finished off our meal with their churro dessert and I can say I've never had churros quite like theirs, filled with deliciousness and chocolate sauce for dipping.   If you're in Vegas, please check this place out!! I really wish they had a location in Arizona for me to go to!",

I ordered the 8.95 mini taco special so I could try a few different meats. I ordered chicken tinga.. Carne asada and bbq beef. They were tasty I was just surprised how small they ended up being! My love Ordered 3 tacos.. Shrimp .. Al pastor .. And chorizo. Overall it was good and I would come come again!",

They have some amazing taco combinations and you buy them individually, so you are not stuck with a plate of food you only wanted half of.   They also had a great beer selection, most I had not heard of.  They are happy to offer suggestions and give you samples until you find something you like.  All of the staff here was great and the bill was small even with all the food and beer.",

So many servers have tunnel vision and are all about getting the guest in and out. She read our minds and understood we just wanted to do some drinking and hanging out. She let us tell her when we were ready to go. Thanks for starting our Saturday off GREAT and making it full of great margaritas. Look forward to seeing Ciara again!",

Asada fries(no pico by choice) it was a small plate but still shareable portion for atleast 2 ppl or 4 in our case bc we had the chips and salsa as well.   Chicken Tortilla soup - definitely recommend.  The tacos are folded and STUFFED. They are not huge but so flavorful. We ordered a few different kinds of tacos Carnitas, chicken, fish, Asada, chicken/potato.  I love that the carnitas came with chicharones on top of it. I ordered a side salad with my 2 tacos. I thought it was weird when the waiter didn't ask what dressing I wanted, so when it came out with green salsa and Mexican cheese crumbles I didn't think I would like it. But it was surprisingly good! I even added on top of my tacos.   Anyways, this was the 2nd time we've come here and never regret it.   Service is 100% perfect. Always checking on you and someone is always refilling the waters.",

The only issue I usually ever have at this restaurant is getting any sort of refills on the drinks in a timely manner. They charge for the chips and salsa and I had one server charge for refills on salsa, but none of the other servers have ever charged us before, so I am not sure what that was about. I tried the carnitas tacos and found them to be bland, personally. The burritos are quite large and according to my friends who have ordered them, they are very good.   The green salsa that comes with the chips and salsa is fantastic. I wish I could buy a bottle of it for home!   Tacos & beer is a great lunch spot and though I haven't been here for dinner yet, I feel like the atmosphere would be fun for dinner as well.",

We arrived an hour early to a no wait to be seated dining room, table of four right this way. Once you order it's on, speed eating, drinks, guacamole with chips followed quickly by our taco selections. As you grab your taco first thing you noticed was a cold tortillas. All the hot ingredients seem to be lightly warmed at best and the toppings were super cold. Our vegan jackfruit taco was more fruity then meaty in flavor. The chicken asada meat was a bit on the dry side, while cilantro rice was decent. Avocado taco, barbacoa both tasted on point, but temperature was luke warm. The asada fries came loaded, but the fries couldn't handle the onslaught of toppings, fries need to be cooked crispier to handle all those toppings. As soon as you remove your hand from a plate, cup or bowl its swooped off the table, no words needed. We appreciate a staff's attentiveness, but this was just a hurried experience from start to finish. Table lacks salt, pepper or any offerings of a house hot sauce or commercial brands..",

If anything isn't right with the food they fix it asap.  Now, the tacos.  Mouth watering right now as I think about the tacos I ate on this past Tuesday.  I had the Barbacoa, El Pastor and Chorizo tacos.  Melt in your mouth with explosive flavors.  It should be noted you can see a lady pressing tortillas inside the restaurant behind glass.   So that alone tells you they're fresh.    I started with chips and salsa.  Fresh tasting warm and crispy tortilla chips.  The red and green lime cilantro sauce is a must.    Drinks were micheladas that were on point with a Cadillac Margarita that was sweet and strong.    Tacos and Beer is a must for those who visit and live here in Las Vegas.  Now for that person who has yet to find a taco place that's not white washed or fake Mexican made this is the place you will need.    Back to the tacos.  Every single time they are packed with whatever meat you order.  It's all in the toppings and the preparation of the meats.  Consistently tasting amazing each visit.    Techno Tuesday has a DJ with pretty loud music so if you're not into that go a little earlier in the day.  Do check out the happy hours because your entire meal is pretty cheap on Happy Hour.  Even without Happy Hour this place does not have the high Strip Prices.    If I had a last meal, I would order tacos from here. - Miguel",

As soon as you take a bite, it melts in your mouth. Our sever told the cooks how much we loved them that they all started staring and smiling.

Something to keep in mind when dining with children.  A couple areas to improve; the toilet, there's a pretty strong smell and cleanliness isn't up to par with the rest of the restaurant. This is a poor reflection on the kitchen. Customer Service, explaining the flavors on the menu could be a great for up sale and maybe a taco to cocktail recommendations could put this place over the top.",

I had their tortilla chicken soup and this was the best I ever had! It was actually thick like a stew and not runny liquid like many versions were.  Their salsa and chips were a cut above too and the employees and service were great too.

    "text": "The Tacos here are pretty good. The meat actually taste like authentic Mexican style marinate and grilling. We tried the carne asada, chicken asada, pork al pastor, and shrimp. The taste of the food was mouth watering. The guac was tasty and the chips tasted home made too. Beer selection was excellent and not to pricy (some beers). The environment was modern and chill. We went on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was not busy at all. We used the groupon deal so we saved quite a bit of money. Without groupon deal I do think the tacos are a bit pricy.   CONS:  Due to it not being busy what so ever it did take a bit of time to our drinks, but once our drinks came it went by quickly.   The portion of guac is way to small to share with another person, it should be a tad bit bigger.   They give you a slice of lime per taco but the limes did not have any juice in them.   We had ordered a Lambic Framboise beer thinking it was going to be a regular sized or on draft,  it came out to be $24 for the beer which is way to over priced for that type of beer.   Overall good experience will be coming back.",

Football was on a couple of televisions and futbol was on one. The bartender Natalie was a True delight. We both had tacos, me the fish. Surprised at how reasonably priced the food was. The draft beers which I guess rotate often are listed on a giant blackboard by the bar with a description.  We tried a couple of different ones and enjoyed them. My wife order something in a can that I realized later cost ten dollars and since the staff had all of their clothes on that seemed a bit pricey or I could see this being a five. Thanks for the improvements and we will be back.",

The bar was full I think it was happy hour,  but because I am pregnant we sat in the very empty dining room. We love the beer selection and the ambiance.  I really wanted to give this place more stars because the food was actually excellent.  We had nachos,  tacos and tortilla soup... All were great! The service was pretty bad I must say.  At first both out orders came out wrong.  My nachos were missing meat and my husbands tacos were made with onions which he had told the server he wanted no onions, and if it hadn't been for the busser,  who also sat us at our table,  we would have had a much worse experience.  I wish I knew his name so I could give him the props he deserves.  He ran all our food and brought us everything we needed, including drink refills and also fixed the server's mistakes with our food.  When the server actually came to the table he didn't even acknowledge or apologize that our orders came out incorrect and just pretended like nothing had happened.  He had a completely careless attitude about his job. I give this place three stars because of the attentiveness of the busser who took care of us so our whole experience wouldn't be a flop,  and for the excellent food.  If our experience would have been handled differently by our server I would have given it five stars.",

The ambaiance made me feel I was walking into hogwarts with what looks like floating candles all over the ceiling. We ordered:  - traditional margarita: amazing combos of freshness made from scratch.  - guacamole: also made from scratch you with the perfect amount of salt and chips  - salsa: chopped with a delicious chipotle twist  - quest fundido: can you go wrong making this dig? What I loved about this was that the queso remained warm through the duration of our meal and the tortillas this came with were the BEST hand made tortillas I have ever had.  - veggie empanadas: this was the one dish we went \"hungry\" and order it was delicious but we were okay with our ordering. The empanadas were topped with a sauce and paired with a light salad - veggie taco: this was the one taco with cheese, it was good - lovely combo of veggies - pineapple and black bean taco: blew my mind away with a sweet and savory combo it's a must have!  - jackfruit taco: perfect amount of seasoning I would 100% get this again.  - flan: also delicious  - tequila shot: the smoothest shot I've taken in a while.  (Shout out to Ivan - who was an awesome waiter and who convinced us to take that shot!)   Overall this place was delicious and very reasonably priced on the lower end of the spectrum but the quality of food was not sacrificed!",

I am always surprised with the positive and upbeat customer service that is receive from the minute we step in to the restaurant to the minute I walk out the door. Lucas our waiter was on point with his recommendations for food and beverages. I had my guilty pleasure Queso Fundido a variety of tacos and the much needed Jamaica and Mescal cocktail. Francisco was also a pleasant and quick with bringing us our food and salsas. Let's face is a taco is not a taco with out Salsa and Limon. Our water glass was never empty and I really enjoyed the attention to detail and the fun vibe we experienced. We were also full we didn't even make room for Dessert, but I am sure I won't make that mistake again.  I hope the management/owners really take the time to praise these two wonderful individuals, for representing there Brand to its fullest capacity.",

The location is not ideal either coming from the SW it is tough to get here without avoiding the crazy traffic from the strip.

A lot of great beers to choose from also!  So once started eating the tacos not so impressed, the lengua taco was good. The shrimp taco was full of toppings but only three little shrimp. The fish taco was the best of the three tacos but it was also just off on taste.  Now to the flautas that was the best part of my order!  They were tasty and filling for a appetizer. The potato and chicken filling was great.   I love authentic Mexican food and this was just not on par for me.   Over all good place to get some great beer and descent food.",

When I drove up I was a little confused as there was yellow construction caution tape all over the front of the building.  I'm not sure if someone ran into it or they were under a remodel. ????  But when I got inside it was lively and very busy at 6pm in a Tuesday.  Luckily I had reservations for our party of six.    There were so many taco choices and good prices.   The flavor and presentation of the food was very professional.    It was a little loud and our server seemed a little irritated with one person in our party and could have been a little more personable. But it was hard to hear him and we did ask for a few substitutes from the menu.   I'm sure we'll be back as the food was great!",

Our server, Lily, took very good care of us and was very helpful in deciding exactly what to eat - asking questions about my likes and dislikes before she gave her own recommendations.  The restaurant is full of \"locals\" but since it is located just a mile away from the Strip, it would make a great place for anyone to enjoy some great food in a fun atmosphere.  The prices are very reasonable and they even offer a  1/2 ounce tequila flight so I tried 4 tequilas I have never had before and now have a new favorite!  Looking forward to coming back on my next trip and will be sure to get here and take advantage of Taco Tuesday (50 cents off each taco)",

Tables were full on the patio, but there was plenty of space inside and Franco took great care of us while we were dining. Super friendly and attentive and always making sure I had a full drink. Love that.  The Paloma I had was delicious, but not the best I've had. I forgot to ask if they squeeze the grapefruit juice in house, but it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked. Good, not great.  The tacos were delicious for the tortillas alone. I had the best view watching the gal making them, from scratch. Makes all the difference.   Jackfruit carnitas Al pastor Crunchy beef with mashed potatoes   Good tacos, great tortillas.   Catch me there next time, hopefully on the patio.",

As someone who lived less than an hour from the mexican border for the majority of my life, I've searched far and wide for the Mexican restaurant I would call home and this is it.   The ambience is great. Casual, but could easily be a place to grab drinks with friends/family or be a date night. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very friendly and always made sure our drinks were fresh and the bussers were constantly keeping our table neat.   Finally, the food. It was so good! They had everything I wanted on the menu. Quest fundido, carne asada fries, any kind of taco you can imagine. (All around $2.50) the value of the food is fantastic. You get high quality, delicious food, for a very reasonable price. Two people can get appetizers, drinks, tacos, and dessert for around $60. That's insane to me. Especially considering their proximity to the strip.   I know where I'll be whenever I crave Mexican food, which is often. Hint, I'll be here, stuffing my face in an ungodly, unladylike manner. #notashamed",

You could tell how fresh everything was and it was one of the best guacamole I've ever had. Then we ordered tacos (the best part). They have a pretty large selection of tacos served a la carte ranging from $2.50-$4.50 per taco. Its cheaper when you come on Tuesdays. I got three tacos (avocado, shrimp, jack fruit). Each one was so tasty and had so much flavor. I was so full when I left. They also have a few vegan options that are actually labeled \"vegan\" on the menu.  Our server was so funny. He had a great sense of humor and gave our tables recommendations for everything. The whole staff was super friendly and on top of the service.",

They need to have a bit of more flavor or add a sauce or quac.  Drinks - Had ordered a Michelada it wasn't good at all, so asked for a new one and then it was actually made better.  Service - It was kinda slow when I went so the service was chill but for how slow it was they could of followed up a bit more.   Venue - Place is chill with a decent layout but a bit too dark in my opinion but not bad of a place.   Probably will check out other places around town before coming back.",

    "text": "A fantastic taco spot lives right off the Las Vegas strip just down the street from Hard Rock Hotel.  Tacos & Beer is a small spot in a strip mall that serves a large variety of differently made style tacos, with plenty of beers on draft, and a great venue.   I actually live in Austin TX and we have tough standards when it comes to quality tacos.  My friends took me here one time and instantly loved it.  I have made it a mission to visit every single time I am back in Las Vegas.  You can easily take a $8 Uber/Lyft from your hotel room on the strip to go there.  This place stays open past midnight each day.  They have a covered outdoor patio also at the venue.  It is more of a restaurant than a bar, but the venue itself is great.  Not too crowded, well run, friendly staff, and some really tasty food.   First start the appetizer off which some salsa & chips or maybe even order some guacamole.  The chips are freshly made here. Now you have this huge list of tacos to choose from.  The tacos are mid sized so a normal person will probably want to order 3-4.  The menu has such a great variety to it.  The steak carne asada taco is an easy win with the grilled skirt steak, beans, guacamole, pico and queso fresco.  I love the spicy pork Chorizo taco with cilantro and onion. Certainly enjoyed the chicken tinga taco with verde salsa and pickled red onions.  The BBQ beef taco was just ok, but didn't care much for the bbq sauce.  Loved the fried avocado taco.  Lastly, who doesnt love a basic bean and cheese taco?  Mix and match your taco selection to get the full combo of flavors they offer.   They serve the tacos on this cool rack that holds each one in place.  Come on Taco Tuesday for $.50 off each.  The bar has plenty of beers on draft and specialty drinks.  Seems Vegas locals also like this spot from chatting with a few different Lyft drivers.  When you are in Vegas, sometimes you just want a simple meal but you still want it to be tasty.  I would much rather pay for the Lyft fare to this spot, get a great meal, then just get another ride back to the strip.  You will realize the cost isnt that much higher than eating in a Vegas strip hotel's basic food court.  This Texan loves Tacos & Beer, and I will keep continue to visit here every time I am in the 702.",

But enough about me and my life without Adderal. This place had great tacos. Great beer and drink selection and a menu that explains everything including the price and size of their beers. To sum things up in two words: I come back.",

    "text": "The food here deserves 5 stars but I'm giving it 3 because of the staff. I've been coming here for quite some time now and everyone that comes to Vegas to visit me, I bring them here and highly recommend this place to all my friends. But recently when I come in the staff is so incredibly rude it's starting to make me hate it here.  Last time I came I brought 7 people with me and was basically told by the door girl that my party was too big and they could \"see if they could seat us\" and that the wait would be over an hour. I gladly gave them my number and told them we would be at Sushi Way (next door) having a drink while waiting. After about an hour and a half we went to check and they claimed they called me (but they didn't) and made us wait even longer then put to tables together and stuffed us in. Then when the table next to us opened up we asked if we could add the empty table so we weren't elbow to elbow and they were so incredibly rude about it, it made all of us uncomfortable after asking that.   My friend (who I highly recommended this place to) came in on his lunch break and sat at the bar. He told me he actually timed it and sat for 21 minutes before the bar tender even acknowledged him. By this time his break was almost over so he got up and left. And said there were only 4 other people sitting at the bar.   I use to come here and be personally greeted by the manager, matter of fact I have about 3 of his business cards. That's how great the service use to be here. Now they're rude and completely disrespectful.  Hopefully you guys get it together and hire more friendly staff. I'll give it a few gos before I stop bringing people here.",

    "text": "Pretty stinking good tacos, mis amigos. I've heard that this fun, little taco joint is owned by the same owner as Firefly (located a hop, skip and a jump down Paradise), one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why would we expect any less quality and amazing-ness from Imperial? This place absolutely exceeded our expectations.  The tacos were very thoughtfully crafted with some lovely, complementary ingredients. We tried a wide variety of their signature tacos and I don't see any reason to stray into the other entree options. The cochinita pibil taco was the only land creature I ate that day and it had intensely good flavor; I especially loved the habanero marinated onions. The grilled fish taco didn't blow me away, but was definitely solid. I loved the fried fish taco, but felt the shrimp taco was probably the winner of the day. Family said the puerco verde was a winner, as was the guacamole appetizer we had to start with.  Their tap selection was great and we were able to buy some IPAs for the table. However, I always forget how expensive Vegas is (we aren't residents) and couldn't believe paying $8-10 for a pint of craft beer. Fortunately, we came during happy hour and were able to quench our thirst with some $3 Negra Modelo on draft.  Finally, we had to get dessert. Their version of choco tacos and churros were awesome and expertly crafted, but the gold medal goes to the churros with their chocolate y whipped cream dips.  EAT TACOS AT IMPERIAL AND BECOME AUTENTICO YOURSELF!",

Typically carne asada is the way to go, but it's definitely further down the list here. Not because it's bad, but because there are others that are simply incredible.   If you like fish Tacos, try the grilled or fried Mahi Mahi, it's very tasty and full of flavor. The beef options are plentiful with lengua, ground, and steak. Then their are a few veggie options, which I haven't tried, and finally... The coup de grace, the pork. First is the pork Verde, which is pretty much sauce less and has (get this) pork rinds. It's very tasty. Lastly, their pork al pastor is to die for. Pineapple, some delicious sauce, perfectly prepared pork and more. Literally the perfect taco.   On top of the food, this joint has the BEST brews in Vegas. I'm a snob about this stuff, and believe me, the selection is INCREDIBLE.   Anyway, if you're on Yelp, you clearly will try this place out before got believe me. Do it. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Ridiculous. They've been open for at least a couple months now, and they're operating as if they'd thrown together a crew of teenagers last night to open today.  We stood at the front for 3-4 mins near the absent hostess table before we began to be greeted. I say \"began\" because before she was even finished with her sentence, the person who greeted us promptly turned around and walked off talking to another worker.  A minute later someone else hesitantly approached us, and the first girl came back and addressed him as if we weren't there: \"can you seat them?\" He did; left & came back only seconds later to take drink orders, and since we hadn't had time to walk up to the bar & look at the current beer selection (the taps change & their waiters evidently don't bother memorizing what's there), he disappeared for a while.  He finally reemerged, took our drink orders, said \"that's it?\" and in the 4 secs it took us process & say \"um, just to drink, yeah, but food wise...\" he was gone again. He didn't come back until later in the evening. I say \"evening\" because the whole experience of ordering & receiving 2 drinks & 4 tacos took nearly two hours.  A different guy walked over 10-15 mins later and asked if we were OK. I told him we wanted to order food, to which he replied, \"oh, I'm just filling in, I'll be back.\" Why did you ask if you weren't expecting to have to do anything about it? To his credit, he did come right back and take our order, and you could tell that he probably had just been called over from Firefly to help out; he was the most communicative out of all the employees we encountered. He checked on our still absent drinks for us and apologized for the wait.  Meanwhile, it was still 30 mins or so before 2 of our 4 tacos were finally delivered. It was another 10-15 mins or so before someone else (who'd also apparently just arrived) came by and asked how we were doing. I said we were still waiting on half our order, and he went to check on it. It was another several mins before the other two got delivered -- and one was missing half of the ingredients the menu said came on it. I finally got someone's attention and let them know. He brought it back to the kitchen window, where one of the cooks dumped a small dollop of salsa & avocado pieces on it, & it was brought back and put in front of me by the first waiter kid, who turned & left again without so much as an apology.  By this time I'm kind of over it all, so when the guy who also apparently just got there came back over to ask how everything was, I told him how there'd been several misses over the course of our time there and I really couldn't see myself coming back. He apologized & said he'd just gotten there (yeah, I gathered that much), and next time he came by he said he'd take care of our food. The 4 tacos cost less than our 2 drinks, so I guess that's good for them.  Food-wise, it was meh. Salsa was decent, but had no spice at all. Chips OK. The veggie and the beans & cheese tacos were pretty good; the baja & chicken tinga tacos, not so much. All together, food would have been a solid 3 stars, & beer selection is decent. The myriad customer service faults dropped it to 1 star. Raised to 2 stars because at least the dude comped the food part of our bill, & one of the other dudes had brought us a second thing of chips & salsa because our food was taking so long.",

Drink order or even any order he has friends dining with him the times I go he put all of them before other guest which is fine but I wish he would acknowledge his other customers instead of hanging out with his friends letting them taste every tequila on the menu while he is working so annoying  I refuse to go in this place again I'd rather go to fireflys next door food is great and staff is at least attentive",

    "text": "Color me impressed. I wasn't sure what to think going into this restaurant. But hey, we had a Groupon.  It's located in the same spot as the original Firefly on Paradise. So it's small-ish. And parking can be challenged when this little strip mall is packed. But that said, we had zero issues at 7pm on a Friday night.  We were seated immediately. Though, there was no hostess at the hostess stand. So we did stand around for a few minutes trying to catch someone's eye.  They're repainted it and whatnot, but it's still a similar layout to how Firefly was. Nice decor. Good ambiance.  The waitstaff were attentive and pleasant. Particularly quick to refill drinks and clear plates.  The guacamole was good. Nothing particularly noteworthy. Next time, I'd probably opt for one of their queso options (they have 2!).  The tacos were delicious. It's all a la carte. The tacos range from $2.50 to $3.75 for one taco. And you can mix and match to your heart's content. The Groupon included 6 tacos, so we tried 6 different ones. They even have vegetarian options, which were quite tasty. In fact, my 2 favs were a veggie one and the pork al pastor (good flavor and topped with pineapple). The beef ones were also good choices.  You can then pick various sides. We went for the chorizo and bacon beans and the cilantro rice. Both were full of flavor.  The drink list is actually pretty good. There's some cocktails and wines, but beer (duh!) is the star here. The beer list was pretty lengthy and had some good finds.  All in all, we had a pleasant and tasty dining experience here.",

I really enjoyed the shrimp taco and chicken nachos, but wasn't a fan of the carne asada taco. The service was really good, I will definitely be retuning.

The manager Manuel kept watch on the whole floor and made sure to assist his staff when they were busy with other customers.   They're salsas were homemade and their hottest one quickly became our favorite. (It was so good we tried to buy a bottle for home.)  When the staff got really busy, Manuel came through in a pinch and personally took our dessert order. He even added an anecdote on his personal favorites and made sure we were never left needing anything else.   The delicious food, laid back attitude, and Manuel's attention to detail has made me a repeat customer for years to come.",

I enjoyed the guacamole and chips as a starter. The guac had a nice hint of lime, and the server was really great at refilling our chips. I ordered the shrimp, baja fish, and al pastor tacos. The seafood tacos were flavorful, and my boyfriend, who doesn't fancy seafood much, helped me finish my baja taco. I loved that the al pastor had pineapple chunks it. The only little downside was that it was a little saucy for my liking.   Overall, the food was amazing, the portions were great, and the service was on point. I definitely will be coming back again, and I'm looking forward to checking out the happy hour specials!",

I have been here many many times and have tried a lot of tacos, but I usually get the al pastor, baja fish, and puerco verde. The other tacos I have tried are the crunchy, carne asada, cochinita pibil, carnitas, barbacoa, and shrimp. All of the tacos are good! You pretty much can't go wrong, but my least favorites are the carne asada and crunchy chicken, but that's not to say those are bad just the others are better. The salsa they give you for the tacos in the little bottles are also good- I personally like the mild salsa  and the hot salsa.   Chips and salsa or chips and guac are good for starters too, just wish it was a free starter. Another good starter I enjoy getting is the corn salad. Also, the margaritas are really good!   I would highly recommend making a reservation for Taco Tuesday since wait can be pretty long, but the Taco Tuesday deal is just 50cents off each taco. The only other downside is that it's kind of pricey for tacos.",

The staff was friendly and we were given a table and menus. Drinks were ordered and appetizers were on its way.  The first to arrive were our chips & salsa (green & red salsa) - but the shining star was the guacamole! We liked it so much, we had to order additional portions.  The next appetizer that arrived was the Bacon Wrapped Jalepenos! Wow! Mild sweet Jalapenos wrapped in smokey bacon. The name alone should have you salivating already! This is the other shining star of the appetizer menu!  The food arrived for our party and I remember how everyone was commenting on how fresh the tortillas were and hailing the guacamole as an encore.  I ordered the hamburger with guacamole & creme. It came with a side of chips and cheese sauce (homemade!!) my birder was awesome - though they did forget the guacamole creme, but quickly redeemed themselves by giving me some on the side.  We stayed and enjoyed our food and conversation. The staff were pleasant and nice. We even took a selfie with one member of the waitstaff!  The place does get busy! We were smart to arrive at the beginning of happy hour!  The prices are pretty fair, our only negative experience was the wait time for our second round of drinks.  I would definitely come back again with friends or other coworkers.  That's my 2 Cents :)",

The decor is really fun, I love the lights. Our server was super friendly and made some good suggestions. I had a house margarita with salted foam, which was good. I also had a mango margarita which was also good and not too sweet.  We ordered guacamole, and added bacon since they were out of pomegranate seeds. It was okay, I've had better but I've definitely had worse.   We ordered a variety of tacos - our Groupon included 6 tacos, 2 sides, and the guac. For our sides we shared a cilantro rice, and the corn salad (street corn, off the cob).  Flavors were great, but the tacos were cold from the toppings/sauces. The corn salad was also served cold, and I would have preferred it to be hot, or at least room temperature. Overall it was a good experience, the temperature variance of the food was kind of a bummer, but I would eat here again.",

I guess that this used to be the old Firefly restaurant, with the same owners as Firefly. Instead of a tapas restaurant, they have turned it into an upscale Mexican restaurant.  The interior is dark and moody, giving the place a very relaxed feel where you can just kick back and chill with your buddies.  First ordered the house guacamole. It was nicely made, but I thought it could have used a touch more seasoning. But, I did enjoy that lil kick of heat that they put in it. The chips were super crispy, and not too greasy.  Then, my tacos came out. First, I gotta say, I love the tacos here. They put a lot of attention to the small details. The rock shrimp tacos are bomb. Coated with a slightly spicy (but not too spicy) seasoning, they were cooked to perfection. I would also recommend the crunchy tacos. They actually put mashed potatoes in them! And it works marvelously. The lengua and barbacoa tacos were hits as well.  Ordered some sides as well. The charro beans were just OK. I did like the fresh chicharrones on top though. Also got the hot chilies. I would say to avoid this. It came with just 3 roasted chilies that were cooked with lime juice. I'm sure there are better options on the sides menu that you can choose.  I like this place and would come back here with friends and colleagues. I would also like to try some drinks here next time, they seem to have an interesting program going on there.",

    "text": "Hi Yelpers, this is my first review, and to be honest the first time I have been absolutely compelled to write a review. I only wish I had pictures to illustrate my point.  My story goes: I spent all night driving to Vegas with a jonesing for some tacos and I stumbled upon this spot. The ambiance, menu and staff were great (4.5 out of 5). Now the food was... horrible. The chips were stale (I dunno how that even happens?), and the tacos were uneatable. No flavor whatsoever, and the ingredients seemed a day old. The final straw was when I opened my al pastor taco and saw a single piece of cilantro! Just one piece! These cooks bestowed no pride or effort into making these tacos, I would have been better served at TacoBell (and I hate saying it). My only mistake was taking my food to go, or else I would have demanded my money back! I wish this restaurant well, and maybe they can turn it around but until then, stay away, far far away from this place.   In a nutshell: The taco's are equivalent to cafeteria food, but the ambiance is great, and unless thats your thing don't waste your money.",

Very friendly and helped us through the menu. Lots of great beers. Most of the craft is in cans or bottles (wish they had more on tap). Food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend that if you order more than 2 tacos only order 2 ate a time. By the time I got to the 3rd it was getting cold. As for the food I ordered the chicken tinga* carne asada and the al pastor. Everything was cooked perfectly and were amazing. We also got the table side guac and tried the bacon and corn on top. You can never go wrong with more bacon in your life (minus the whole cancer thing). We will be coming back here soon on this trip and futures trips.",

The draft beer selection, while not exceptionally large offering about a dozen choices, was varied in style. Our exceptionally friendly and helpful server (?Kaycee) happily provided samples of the interesting choices. The margaritas were tremendous and were quite the bargain during the early and late happy hours at only $4.  P.S. and to all of the previous posters that recommened to get the pumpkin seeds added to the guacomole dip, you were all correct.",

First, we were there on a Friday night at 10:30pm and sat right down.  Service for us was GREAT ... from the bus boys to the servers.  And I'm the kind of guy that WILL tip less (or not at all) for bad service. Second, I felt the price of the tacos was right in line for what you get.  These are definitely not your regular street tacos (which I like too).  For two us .... 4 tacos, one beer, and tip came to $21 (no complaints). Third, the tacos were really good.  Only got to try two, so looking forward to going back and trying some of the other creations. Fourth, probably my only complaint (and it's a small one) is that I feel for ANY restaurant that serves a lot of finger food, they should have hand sanitizer all over the place ... very accessible.  With that said, I did go to the bathroom to wash my hands.   :)",

Very good.  We also had the shrimp taco, the Baja fish, and my wife's favorite, the bean and cheese.  It was made with a soft corn tortilla, beans, cheese, and some fresh veggies on top.  As simple as it was it was full of flavor.  We also particularly enjoyed the cilantro lime rice.  Overall the staff was friendly and helpful and made sure we had enough beer at all times.

So when i heard that this hip little place that used to be Firefly was slinging some seriously good grub, i had to check it out. I was NOT disappointed! This place is fantastic. I've only ever sat at the bar, and only ever ate the tacos, but i've heard everything on the menu is dynamite, but my main obsession is the al pastor and the puerco verde (topped with chicharron), but the fish tacos or to die for, and the chicken tinga is simple and delicious.  I highly recommend this groovy little spot, especially for happy hour!",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW. What an atrocious experience I experienced last night. I flew in from NY and I was there with my brother, his girlfriend, and my boyfriend and we came to enjoy some tacos & beer for Taco Tuesday.  We had ordered our tacos and my boyfriend wanted to try the beer sampler my brother had recommended to try. So minutes later we got our guac and tacos and beer sampler.   I wish we COULD have enjoyed it but.. MINUTES later.. our beer sampler had been SNATCHED from our table from the manager (Chuy Ramos) without us even knowing why. Just gone- disappeared right off of our table. I thought he was going to come back and explain himself--- but NOPE. HE didn't. So in awe that ANYONE in the restaurant business would do that, I called my waitress. First of all, vegas is HUGE on hospitality and taking ANYTHING off anyone's table without first explaining WHY is a NO NO. You just DON'T do that. So back to my story, I spoke to the waitress to call him over because I wanted to know first hand why he took our beer sampler away without any explanation of why. He came over, was rude and DEFENSIVE- NOT apologetic at all. He told me that he thought that our table had no intentions of paying for it.. WHAAT?? How does that even make sense. REGARDLESS- I told him it was inappropriate and unprofessional and rude. His response: \"I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE. HAVE A GOODNIGHT!\" .. I WISH I was joking.  Management or the owner should know that this is the kind of manager that is running this restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be returning and neither will anyone of my family members. That is definitely not the Vegas hospitality I was accustomed to.  I'm from Vegas, grew up here, went to UNLV here.. and I have never experienced such rudeness. He should have been apologetic and brought back our beer sampler.. but nope he did not. Just watched us until we finished our food and we left.",

I started with a Tahoe Mountain wild pale ale that had a fragrance of grapefruit and a pleasantly hoppy finish. My wife had a Gose which she found too sweet, but I found very tasty. Salsa offerings with the chips and salsa were very fresh tasting. The Queso Modelo on the other hand was bland with a very un appealing texture, in our opinion. On the plus side though, it was a huge serving for an app.   Entrees were the taco sample with a few more tacos on the side. The stand out had to be the Adobada. So flavorful. Carnitas and Puerco Verde were also very good. I thought the Lengua was somewhat flavorless; all the punch on that taco came from the delicious pickled radishes and salsa on top.   On the side we tried the Charro beans. They were so good they made me wanna slap my momma! Definitely a must try.   Service was speedy and attentive. The food came just about as fast as it takes to make a fresh tortilla and make a taco. We will definitely be coming back especially for the happy hour specials.",

We started out with the Queso Modelo and ordered our own individual orders. I ordered the Carne Asada taco, barbacoa taco and chorizo taco. We received the queso modelo first and proceeded to absolutely destroy it. We loved it so much we ordered another. Mind you, this is before we received our individual orders. Shortly after we polished off the first order of queso modelo our individual orders came up. My three tacos I ordered came out perfectly. I loved every one of them and they got better and better with every taco I ate. My grandma ordered the fried avocado taco with cilantro dressing and proceeded to destroy it commenting on how it was the best taco she'd ever had. My cousin ordered the carne asada fries and asked me to eat half of it and they were extremely good. We were extremely satisfied with every aspect of this restaurant. Frank, our server made us feel very comfortable he was extremely sociable and kept up on empty drinks before we could finish them. One of the best servers we have ever had the pleasure of being around. He made us feel at home and relaxed. Overall this restaurant is a 5/5. Everything was right throughout the order and we will be returning and recommending to friends. Thank you Tacos and Beer!!",

Chips are good, salsa is solid.  Everything is pretty inexpensive and they have a solid beer listing.   Service is outstanding, especially for a place that is busy as they are.",

The corn was also so good and full of flavor. If you like corn I definitely recommend this.   Next we ordered practically every taco on the menu and they were ALL amazing, fresh homemade tortillas as well.. My personal favorites were the fish taco and the baja fish taco. They were both so packed with flavor I couldn't decide which I liked better! By far some of the best fish tacos in Vegas, I'm also a huge fan of fish tacos...  The carne asada, chorizo, chicken tinga were also yummy...   We got churros for dessert and those were also to die for.   Overall everything was amazing and we will definitely be back!!!",

The most expensive I've seen outside of a sporting venue or concert arena. Paid $12 for a 10 oz. farmhouse ale!   Worthy stop for tacos & beer choices, hence the name. 20 taps and a bottle selection.  The restaurant name on Yelp says Imperial Tacos & Beer. There is no mention of Imperial here anywhere so it was tough to find at first, especially on Open Table.",

Got there around 10:50 pm The happy hour started at 11pm where they have Mexican beers and margaritas on special for 3& 4 dollars. The shots of patron we got were like 10$ each but big shots worth it with a diet coke back . (Also they refilled my diet coke through out the night it was on the bill After but they took it off cause I told them it was my backer for my shot) it was a big glass.  Customer service was great! Waiters are pleasant and attractive.  The tacos are amazing! all reasonably priced and sized like 3/4$ each . They are speciality tacos and very good not like generic ground beef or something. Each is unique and flavorful   The spicy shrimp (big shrimps ) n steak taco were my favorite! I will definitely be going back for those. They were spicy and had different amazingly yummy hot sauces to choose from On each table . I also got mahi mahi taco and ceviche was an amazing appetizer with loads of chilled mahi mahi . Tip : come during happy hour and your tacos are only 2/3$ and happy hour is 3-6pm Or 11-2am The ambience was great! There was live DJ spinning great music, I didn't want to leave.! And it makes it for a good place to have some drinks of course.   Crowd was classy and attractive. And it is a mexicAn resturant , so there was also a Mexican soccer team There. It was cool :)  It was pretty dark with green neon lightening . Which I loved added to the night life ambience.   In summary an amazing Resturant and I will be back! Hope they have a DJ again! It was a Tuesday night when I visited!",

    "text": "Hello welcome to Tacos and Beer. I went here for an event . Elote tasting event. This event was advertised on Facebook and had 550 people saying they were going. My expectation for this \"event\" was not what I experienced. If you are going to have an event and advertise it, you must be prepared for it. I was thinking maybe parking lot blocked off with a beer tent and Elote being cooked on a grill nearby. The Elote were these barely bite size tastings, and there was hardly enough for all that came to participate. I had one flavor of the four offered. When I arrived the staff had no idea about event or where we should sit. We sat in restaurant and I guess we should have been sat in bar. Bar was way overcrowded standing only. We did get some food and drinks where we were and the staff did their best to keep checking on us. I ordered a beer and did not get what I ordered and it came in a plastic cup half the size of the glasses my friends got. For the price of the Beer I ordered I asked for a proper container and correct beer. the server had me keep the one he gave me and I never saw him again. No charge for beer though, so that was fine. Overall this was my best view of the restaurant and was not happy with it.   Thank You for dining? Tacos and Beer. I may go back and give them a second chance. Menu looked good and I saw some plates that looked appetizing. I can say will not attend any more poorly planned events there.",

The tacos run $3-4/each normally and were pretty good. The roasted corn w/ poblano and the baja fish tacos were my favorites. We pretty much tried all of them. Can't speak for the beer selection since we decided to get pitchers of margaritas since we had already had a few before the restaurant. The pitchers of margaritas were a great price at $32/each giving about 5-6 margaritas each. Would def recommend trying out this place.",

While this may not be a \"traditional\" Mexican restaurant, their tacos are amazing and come in a variety of flavors! I got the barbacoa and the carne,  while my buddy got a crunchy taco with ...

The Pork al Pastor is great, but the Fish Taco is out of this world! Further, the integrity of the management and wait staff is really commendable. I left a bag with something valuable within on the back of my chair (on the patio)  and didn't notice til I was at the airport. I called the manager, who had it, and I was able to retrieve it without difficulty. And the manager would not take the cash I offered.  If I ever get back to Vegas, I will stop here again.

Drinks: hands down the best house margaritas I've ever had in Vegas, and I've been out here my whole life. My boyfriend had the michelada, he is from Mexico and said their micheladas are amazing! Also the bartender was Blake and he was awesome, had a great personality and was very attentive to all of the guests. They also have such an amazing wide selection of beers !! I can't wait to try them all.  Food: the tacos on happy hour are so good, we got 3 chicken ones and 4 beef ones, I don't recall the names of the meat because they're fancy names and in Spanish, that my boyfriend had to explain to me, but we were just looking at the happy hour menu,but they were tasty and an awesome deal for $2.50 each. I also love how they have housemate hot sauces! They are all so tasty I can't even tell you which one I like the best. Atmosphere: great people, great vibes, awesome staff, and good conversations. We will definitely be regulars here. Thank you for the great service. If I could give this place a 10 star I would. Thank you Blake for making our experience as great as you did, you're an awesome bartender, and you make the best margaritas I've had in Las Vegas.",

Best ever was from a truck in Nogales Arizona. Second best was El Camino, Columbus Ohio (of all places). But now the two-spot is Tacos and Beer.

The restaurant and bathroom are clean and well-maintained; the decor in both with the European tilework is very pretty. The parking is easy and convenient as their is a parking lot directly in front of the restaurant. It took a little while for our food to come to the table, I was also starving so it might have seemed like forever, but it was delicious! The waiters were great and helped in deciding which tacos are more popular, etc. I got three of the pork tacos (slow-roasted pork, chorizo, and al pastor), which cost me ~$10. I forgot which one, but one had pineapples in it which was my favorite! The tacos are delicious, though a little oily. I also thought they were tiny...I'm 5'2\" and I was content after 3 tacos, but could have easily eaten a 4th. I highly recommend this place to everyone who's looking for some solid Mexican food, especially as they have great vegetarian options, as well! Looking forward to coming back.",

Let me start off by saying there was 17 of us and we understand it takes longer due the amount of people. For starters the restaurant was not even that packed and there were a lot of employees standing around in the back of the restaurant. Not a bad thing because it's nice to see they have enough servers to accommodate the customers which I was sadly mistaken. I can go on tell you our experience but this place is a joke when it comes to customer service. Rather than apologizing for getting our order wrong, the staff  argued with us and defended themselves. To the owner, all of the negative reviews are about service and that should be a hint to maybe reevaluate the current staff you have on hand. You are better off going to Taco Bell getting better service and receiving your whole order at the same time.",

I asked where the meet up was at the door and the two men standing there didn't know and then said the waiter would know. The waiter took me outside while they set the tables fast because it was 105 degrees.    He took my wine order then next thing I know people are getting their food so I asked the woman serving water if my wine was coming and she assured me it was but looked confused. After 30 mins I finally just went to the bar. The water was refilled every 5 mins but no one took my order and the whole situation happened all over again. It's just easier to go up to the bar. I didn't eat but the menu looked great and had loads of options. Very inexpensive and everyone at the table seemed to be taken care of. I would definitely give this place another chance.",

The treatment of guests at night is substantially different than during the day/lunch hours, which is when I would usually be here.   I was ignored by the bartender most of the (slow ass) night. Things started badly when I asked for the HH menu, which says a certain set of bottled beers are half off - and that these beers are marked on the menu. It turns out to be a disingenuous menu because none of the bottles are marked. When I asked my bartender about this, she seemed confused, and called over someone else. This man was very unclear.  Me: \"Which bottles are on happy hour\" Him: \"oh what kind of beer do you usually like\" Me: \"I like various beer, but I want to know which bottles are on special\" Him: \"If you tell me what beer you like, I can get you one similar\" Me: ...  This went on for a minute until he informed me that they weren't doing bottle specials anymore, and that was an erroneous menu page. This was a bait and switch, pure and simple.  Frustrated with the experience, and just wanting to leave but still waiting for my tacos, I asked for an iced tea, it was served with no ice - just a room temperature brewed tea, and the bartenders/servers couldn't even be reached to try and fix the problem. Finally, although it was HH, I was charged regular menu rates for my clearly HH tacos. I left disgusted with the overall experience. I had two tacos and an iced tea, and want my $9.04 back for the trouble it caused. Tacos were good.",

Thank you Groupon for bringing me to this place, because I seriously gave up on finding decent Mexican food in vegas.   The guacamole was probably one of top 2 best guacs of my life. It was fresh and flavorful.   I love their chips. It has a great texture, and it's my favorite kind of chip. I don't know if it makes sense, but I hate it when I can smell old oil or taste it in my chips when they haven't changed it in a while. Not here.   Baja fish (beer battered Mahi Mahi) tacos- 3 star.  Shrimp tacos - 4 star.  Carne Asada tacos- 4 star.  Beef barbacoa- 2 star.  Guacamole - 5 star. Corn salad- 4 star. Refried Beans with Chorizo - 1 star.  BEANS and CHORIZO! Doesn't that sound amazing?  I was sold by the description but it had a lot of chili powder or some spice in it that was overpowering. I couldn't really appreciate the flavor at all.  Service- 5 star. They were on point most of the time. I did have to ask for some refills on my soda, but, it's all good.  Ambiance- 5 star.   I'm a bit confused as to how I'm giving this 5 star after seeing my average up above of each item. I think I was thoroughly impressed with the guac, chips, ambiance, and service. I also loved their flour tortilla (made to order) that they use for the tacos. Presentation of the tacos reminded me of China Poblano (at the Cosmopolitan) so it has this \"fancy\" feel to it without having to pay $4.50 for a taco.   I think the Groupon deal made this place worthwhile too, considering that we paid almost half of what the dinner was worth. I will definitely be back to try other tacos on the menu next time!",

I like the \"crunchy taco\" -\"guero\" style seasoned ground beef & mashed potato, crunchy shell w/lettuce, pico, sour cream, hot sauce, cheddar cheese  Cheap but not Free. Like $2.50 - $4 per taco.  1.99 for chips and salsa  Advice: Go with the pitcher of Margarita not by the glass, or beer.",

There was around a forty minute period after we finished eating that nobody came over, eventually we flagged down a bus boy who got the waiter. And then our bill included items we didn't even order.  Edit:  The manager reached out to me and discussed the situation.  It sounds like it was just a hiccup that comes with a rookie staff in a recently opened restaurant.  The manager was truly excellent in how he handled my complaints.  I have changed my review score to reflect the food more highly rather than the service, because I believe the service will improve with time.  The food is truly good and they have the best craft beer menu in the area by far.",

    "text": "On our recent trip to Vegas we were looking for something reasonably priced that was open a little later (dinner around 9:30pm.) We also decided to include the idea of going off the strip, and after a random search of restaurants not too far from our hotel selected Tacos  Beer.  We were pleasantly surprised to have discovered this hidden gem.  It was dead when we arrived (only 2 other people inside) which we were a little worried about at first, but any worries we had quickly went away once we got the food.  The guacamole was delicious and the tacos were some of the tastier ones I've had in quite a while (my favorite was the baja fish taco.)  The cilantro-lime rice (side) was also very delicious.  Staff were very friendly and attentive.  Overall a great value, tacos were an average of $3 a piece.  For dinner for 4 of us with two rounds of beer the bill came to a very reasonable $100...and it was definitely worth exploring slightly off the beaten path of the strip.",

We received a free beer sampler after discussing how my bf and him shared the same beer tastes. Not only Carlos, but the rest of the staff was amazing. On top of everything they were speedy! They really wanted to makes sure we enjoyed ourselves and you can tell EVERYONE cares about the business. They treated all the customers so nicely. The tacos were unique and DELICIOUS.

    "text": "We gave this restaurant a second chance and this second visit in comparison to the first one below was a total 180! The food,service, prompt and efficient service was impeccable. Our server, Armando, was beyond attentive and knowledgeable. The GM and Manager, Manuel and Carlos were equally hospitable to not only us but, all the customers dining. Everyone helped out with serving, cleaning and seating that this was the best teamwork I have seen in any restaurant so far. Round of applause to this restaurant and we hope to see another location up by our neck of the woods soon. Affordability meets Quality!! Bravo!!! You have gained a couple of regulars and many more to follow us.. First review below but, I want to state that our complaint was with the service not the food... My husband suggested this place because he heard the food was good. So, we were first timers here. May I just say that the food would've tasted so much better had we had good customer service and hot food. When we walked through the door, there was no greeting. The hostess walked passed us to seat another person. It is Sunday and there were only 4 tables with people... meaning they were not busy at all. They had one hostess, one bartender, and about 6 people maybe more in the kitchen. So, the hostess comes back and she seats us. We wait about five minutes, then we get served our water. Again, this is our first time, so we start asking the person serving our drinks to us about their sauce and options about the menu and he was clueless. So, I ask him \"Are you our server?\" and he says \"Ah, good question\" smiles and walks away. So, we wait another 15minutes, looking at the menu... then the hostess who sat us comes over and to our surprise, she is also our server. So, we start asking about the menu & order our food. Now, I don't know who hasn't been to a Mexican restaurant but, normally when you order Chips & Salsa (which wasn't free) you get it before your meal comes out. So, we are talking, having conversation and about another half hour later, No Chips , No Salsa or my extra side of Refried Beans. So, we get caught up in conversation again... another 15minutes goes by, and our food arrives.. not hot but lukewarm... and still No Chips or salsa. So, assuming they forgot, I told the guy who served us our food to just cancel the Chips, Salsa and Refried beans... he says \"Oh, you ordered Chips& Salsa? I'll get it now\" ... he then goes to the hostess/Server and tells her. Then, comes back to me and says \"So you sure you wanted to cancel the chips & salsa?\" I say yes and he apologizes. Mind you, only one other table sat down after us making a total of 6 tables filled now. In addition, our hostess/server did not check on us at all until the middle of our lunch. She did not apologize for the mistake in our chips&salsa order either. The table that sat waaayyyy after us also got their food before us. The only time our supposedly hostess/server was nice was as the end , when we asked for the check and a to go box. Don't get me wrong, the food here is good and I wish the service was better. I have a background in customer service and management and if this was my restaurant, I would want someone to let me know what I could do to improve it. Well, this is me telling them what needs to improve. I only gave this place 2 stars for 1) the food and 2) because I feel bad that I can't give more. Normally, I take pictures of the decor, menu and the food but, I was distracted by the lack in customer service that I just wanted to hurry up and eat and leave.",

Also, be prepared to pay $6 for Tecate.  For those prices, you're better off anywhere else. The food didn't taste great, it was severely over-priced, missing key ingredients, and took much longer than necessary.  Patrons beware.",

I saw on Yelp that it was a new business on Paradise Blvd and vowed to check it out after work.  It's in the old Firefly building.  Many great memories on that patio :). The decor is all redone Spanish mission style and much better lit now.  I ended up getting the shrimp tacos.  Small street tacos with intense flavor profiles and a small side of gormet salsa. I also got a Hitachino's Nest -- this is a Japanese microbrew and they have it ON DRAFT!  The beer list is written on the wall by the bar and contains all the best stuff- Unitis, Lost Coast, Stone, Brooklyn Brewing.  Staff was attentive and really sweet and funny.  I'm so happy to have found this.  Ok I just read that this place is owned by Mr Simmons - that owns Firefly.  They have had some pretty publicized scrapes with the Health Inspector in the past. Make your own decision.  Casinos do get away with a lot compared to small private places.  It looked VERY clean and well run when I was there.",

Salsa was good...they just don't give too much. I love the water of all things but maybe was just thirsty. I got the happy hour margarita.

Yeah yeah, I'm breaking my own rule that no place that serves everyday food should get more than 4 stars but the extra star is to keep this place going so I can come back for lunch over and over.    The tacos are excellent...not as big as a \"Los Tacos\" taco but very tasty.  Definitely an artisan concept as other reviewers say.  Everything we tried was complex in ingredients and flavor (as much as you can pack into a street taco sized portion).  Our table tried out almost all the tacos on the menu and there was an overall preference for the various pork tacos but they were all good.  Service was fantastic but we need to go back to re-review as traffic was light today and it seemed all the staff was focused on a few tables.  Hope more people start going so they can continue to do well.    Definitely looking to go back after work to try all the beers....oh yeah...the tomatillo salsa was the best I've had in a while.",

We ordered al pastor,  carne asada, Baja fish, cochina pork and another pork taco that I can't recall the name of and lengua.  We also ordered the beans and grilled Jalepenos....those sides were the cherry on top. They're not your typical beans that's for sure. I can probably eat two  orders to myself (no shame, they were that delicious) they also have a nice selection of craft  beer, so that's definitely a plus. I will be going back for sure.",

The meat itself had very great flavor and the toppings tasted just as great as they looked. The overall presentation of the food was pleasing.  I do have to say that the waiter hardly came to the table. Anytime something was needed, which was rare, we had to flag him down. Once the order was put it, drinks and food came out quickly.",

An hour later, still no table and I was tired of standing, plus it was getting stuffy. I went to check the patio, however I was stopped. The gentleman said talk to the girl to my left. Puzzled, I looked over, she waved hi. Apparently she was signaling me to pay $5, which I thought was profound. At this point I'm hangry and frustrated by the whole thing, so I pay for my party. As she charges me, I'm told they don't have seating outside; real class act. At this point, I'm ready to leave, when another guy reaches towards me asking for my ID. WTF!?  I walk back to the hostess and ask the table situation. Surprised, she says \"you haven't been seated yet?\" I already had more friends in their way, so I was stuck. We waited another 30-minutes before being seated and another 20-minutes before a server came by. All in all, I waited 2-hours for two choco-tacos and I went home. At least they tasted good.",

The beef taco had a bottom layer of beans, meat some type of relish, cheese and cilantro. The beef had a tanginess that I was not ready for.  Still good, but different.    The Avocado taco was served in a soft corn shell.  Wish I would have asked for crunchy.  Just my preference.  It was good but had a bit of bitterness to it.  Not sure how I feel about it.  I also got a draft margarita which was bomb!!!  Too much ice, but good.  The waitress was very accommodating.    My daughter said the enchilada's were good, but drowning with the relish.  She only ate half of it.  I heard this place good, but I found it to be just ok.",

    "text": "Fancier tacos for just a little bit more than a taco shop. The restaurant is small and cozy and there's a patio towards the parking lot. Some nights can get reaaally busy and loud. So much so that I've left because I don't want to deal with it. However, their tacos are far better with more variety than you'll get anywhere in town.   I've had a lot of their tacos but the number one recommendation is: anything with mashed potatoes. It's a game changer. The BBQ beef taco does this well. Lately I've been trying out their vegetarian options and I must say the Veggie taco is surprisingly good. The mushroom is thick and flavorful and of course the potato adds smooth creaminess. I tried the beer battered avocado taco last night. It was packed full of avocado and creamy sauces. The batter definitely reminded me of having a beer battered halibut taco, minus the halibut. I'd probably get this again but it's a lot of food. The guacamole is nothing special, but it is fresh and I like the queso fresco in it.   I'm usually good just ordering two tacos, and my boyfriend is usually full off of three. I do recommend eating any crunchy tacos first, as they get soggy pretty quickly. Also make sure to ask for hot sauces, they have four to choose from. Overall it's a great place to bring friends and family. There's a lot to explore on the menu and the quality is a surprise to people expecting taco shop food. Check the website to see if there are events going on to avoid the place being packed and loud music, unless you're into that.",

Ordered drinks from two different people, only to have to go open a bar tab myself just so I can get my drinks. Place came highly recommended and I had been blindly recommending it to others as well. Finally gave it a try and had a tip added to the bill and it went unmentioned, had empty drink glasses the whole dinner service, the server never returned after the food was brought out. Took my family here promising them a great time and was left embarrassed... and so I thought maybe it was a fluke so took my husband in last night well needless to say, but after last nights service, my recommendation will come with a warning of wait times and empty drink cups and missing servers.   It's a shame when a great spot with a stellar menu gets muddied up because they let service go by the wayside.",

Server drops off drinks, then rushes off without taking order. We wait and wait and wait.......no server. Other servers just walk back and forth past our table, no acknowledgement. There were about 4 tables at the time. I flag down a young man, who gets us a server, not the original one. The server seemed annoyed and rushed off to put in the order. The young man came back and told me that my original server went on break and didn't tell anyone we were waiting to order. Like it was hard for the other servers not on break to notice? Thank god the food was amazing. The cooks and chefs should quit and open up their own place, not do the servers any favors. While leaving, no one said goodbye. Male server and hostess stood at the front door talking about a boyfriend or something and didn't even acknowledge us leaving. I will never come back and never recommend.",

    "text": "Last night after a few drinks my fiancee and I were in need of some quick, cheap and delicious drunk food. At first we were thinking fast food but then we passed by tacos and beer and thought, why not! And we were not disappointed at all. We ordered guacamole and added corn, bacon and cities. It was absolutely delicious, had some hint of spice, lots of crumbled, crispy bacon and sweet corn. Our tacos came out shortly after. The prices were amazing, most expensive was shrimp at $3.95 and a lot were under $3. I got shrimp and carne asada, and they were the best tacos I have had in Las Vegas. They were big, over flowing with pico sauce, guac and meat. If you are a fan of shrimp tacos, you have to try the ones at tacos and beer. My fiancee got lengua, carnitas and beef barboca and each of his were better than the last. Each taco had an array of fillings and sauces and the flavored were perfect. We didn't try any drinks (had just come from a bar) but next time for sure.  The only downside is that it took a pretty long time for our waitress to come over and get our order, but the food quickly made up for that minor misstep on the waitress' end.   We will definitely be heading back to this place very soon and often.",

I asked the hostess for a table and she asked me, \"Did you already order at the bar?\", and I respond yes. She told me that she couldn't give me a table because the server would get mad! I asked why and she said, \"Because you've already ordered at the bar.\".  I asked why this was a problem and she said that the servers lose money whenever you order at the bar. So apparently I'm not allowed to sit at a table because the server might not like it. The hostess noticed that I was getting upset and she said she would give me a table, but if she needed it to seat someone else I would have to take my food and move to the bar. I told her that's fine because at that time the restaurant was getting empty and a lot of tables were getting clear.  My server must have assumed I wasn't going to tip him because he brought me water and never returned to take my order. I ended up ordering food at the bar. I finished and tipped the bartender for being so helpful, and also my server even though he was useless. Maybe the managers need to watch their servers and hostesses more closely.",

    "text": "Don't go here!!!! This is the worst place I've been to in a very long time and it really really takes a lot for me to say that but I feel everyone needs to know so that they don't experience what I had to go through. From the beginning I knew it was a bad sign when my party and I were not greeted , not knowing if we can seat ourselves or have to wait for someone, after waiting for a minute to be seated we were told to sit anywhere and when we chose a table we were told \"you can't sit there\". What!!? So after we were given a table that we could sit at our waiter came by and took our order, well that was the only time we saw our waiter, he disappeared never to return, never checked up on us, NOTHING! Our order was wrong when it was brought to us and our side dishes didn't come until the end, the point of side dishes are to enjoy them during the meal. The food was nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary, their beans taste exactly like Hormel chilli beans and everything lacked flavor. Del taco has better tacos and beans than this place and they even sell burgers! With no service from our waiter I flagged down the busboy and then took the job of our waiter refilling our drinks and taking our plates, etc. When it came time to pay the bill it was just as awful, more like a 25min awful wait. I literally could've dined and dashed with all the opportunities I was given not being served but my party said no because karma is a bitch so I agreed. I ended up getting up to pay the bill at the front of the Resturant where I met the owner and told him about our horrible experience and he didn't seem to care, at the same time out waiter magically appeared as we were leaving and talking to his boss. After a couple of minutes of them talking our waiter came back with a revised bill, I paid him and gave the tip to our busboy. On top of all the horrible service and horrible food I ended up getting food poisoning that I still am suffering from as I write this review. DONT GO HERE! Save your money, there are way better places with better food than this place.",

The wait staff and bartenders are pretty awesome and I have never had a bad time here. I highly recommend it to friends and family, and visit there about once a week these days. I've been for lunch, dinner and for drinks late. There's never a bad time to stop in. The beer is great, and I usually ask for a sample of the ones I don't know. They are always generous with the samples and usually recommend a good beer based on my tastes. I end up with something on the light side like a Maui Blonde, but my brother likes the Sucaba and darker beers from Firestone. The prices are very reasonable, unlike Aces and Ales which is similar but very pricey. Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.",

I will say that the idea of the ambiance that was created was very inviting and  had somewhat of an authentic feel to it. Once we were greeted and seated, we started to notice that there was quite a bit of disorder and chaos near and around the kitchen area.  The waitress took longer than most places to take our order. Once we received our food, which was mediocre to say the least, it felt as though employees were hovering over us.  We felt very rushed and uncomfortable.  I looked around and noticed that they were doing that with all the tables.  Just a word of advice, if you are looking to enjoy a meal at your pace without helicopter employees, I would not recommend Imperial Tacos & Beer.  I honestly think that with the proper training in this industry to bring it up to standards, this place could have potential.  At this point, I will not be returning.",

We started with chips and guac which were mediocre, a little bland.  So we thought we add some spice.  We asked for hot sauce and continued asking for it, 3 times to be exact, didn't get it till our tacos came out.  I don't know if maybe they were having an off day but will definitely not be back to waste my money.     I am a very understand customer especially being that I work in that industry but man, it was honestly that bad!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I am a huge taco fan!  So when I tell you that the tacos here are some of the best tacos I've ever had, that really means something. I've been here multiple times and tried almost all the tacos so far, my favorites are the al pastor and the veggie. The al pastor is so flavorful with little chunks of pineapple on top... And you might think I'm crazy when I say the veggie taco is one of my favorites, most people like meat in their tacos, but this veggie taco is so tasty! Mashed potato in place of meat, mushrooms and what ever else veggies it has, perfect... It might just turn me vegetarian! Jk but it is very good. I'm not a beer fan at all, so I can't comment on the beers, but the cocktails I've had are the Dirty South Andy (kinda like a Moscow mule with little tweaks) and House Margarita (it has \"salt air\" instead of salted rim which is pretty unique and cool!). This place is pretty new still but I think once the word gets around it will be pretty popular!",

    "text": "I made reservations two weeks ago for my girlfriends birthday  for 12 of us at 2pm. We were seated quickly upon our arrival but that was about the end of our speedy service.   Our server started off by taking our drink order. We all ordered waters and some ordered beer. I ordered a Purple Haze Drink and a friend ordered the Jamaica Con Mezcal, both of which were too strong and too sweet. We both had everyone at the table try ours and not a single person liked either of them. They were gross and at $12.00 a piece, I didn't want to take a chance on anything else.   About 20 minutes later, we were ready to order some appetizers, but our server was no where to be found. When we all finally were able to order the chips and salsa or chips and guac, they all came out at different times. It was confusing, some of us were sure if he got our order or not. Eventually everything came out and we snacked on that for a while. The green salsa was delicious and the other needed salt, it really had no flavor.   I was over the drink I ordered and decided to order a glass of champagne. I had two kids with us that ordered drinks and all three of us were forgotten about. My glass came with a shot of bourbon, that I didn't order and sent back, which ended up on the bill later.  A half hour of waiting later, our table started to get restless and wanted to order food. It was extremely difficult to get our servers attention. I don't know if they were busy or if he was the only person that can take orders but it was frustrating for the entire group.  We eventually all ordered our food and in about ten minutes, everything started to come out sporadically. I ordered 1 chorizo taco, 1 al pastor taco and 1 shrimp taco. While I appreciated the homemade tortillas, they were soaked from the sauces put on the taco and they fell apart in our hands. That was a unanimous comment from everyone at the table as well as the flavor of the tacos \"just weren't that great.\" I also ordered a side of the cilantro lime slaw.......it was a pinch of slaw with some sauce poured on top. It was laughable and seemed more like an afterthought and not worth the $2.00 that they charge for a side.   A friend ordered the tortilla soup and she said it was just alright and tasted different than every other tortilla soup shes had. My son ordered a plain bean and cheese burrito that came with Spanish rice that had NO flavor at all.  My father in law ordered the vegan avocado taco, I was  going to order one after my first three and he told me not to bother, it wasn't that great. However, the bacon wrapped jalapenos were a hit, we had at least three orders of those.   We sat there once we were done eating waiting for the check to come, it didn't. We all tried to get our servers attention, we couldn't. Eventually,  two people got his attention and our server had the check on him and left it at the table. I did let him know when we first sat down that it was my girlfriends birthday and he brought the birthday flan when picking up the bill money.  This restaurant charges 20% gratuity for a party over 6 and they also do not let you split the bill. Everyone brought cash and that was fine. What is NOT fine is the mandatory tip. I am not cheap in any way and will give large tips as well as track down the manager to let them know what a great job a server did. Being forced to pay 20% of this bill for the service that we got is a little messed up. Not a single person at our tale was happy and no one wanted to leave anything more than the mandatory tip.   I do not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "So we had a event at UNLV that night and we were having one of those taco cravings. We had driven by this place a few times recently and kept saying those famous \"next time were here\" phrases, well we decided to pull the trigger and were not disappointed, here is our take on things...  Food - In one word, awesome!!!!!. First there were so many different tacos to choose from but we ended up with me having chicken and my wife having steak and carnitas. The tortillas were homemade, the meat was flavored well, juicy an tender. We did a side of guacamole and chips and will say the guacamole was pretty good. The dessert is what put this place over the top, churros with some trimmings were amazing (DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT GETTING THE CHURROS).   Atmosphere - There is both inside and outside dining, the inside is intimate so may want to make reservations on open table or, better yet YELP. The inside was decorated really well and had a unique feel. The bar can only be described as bad ass, reminded me of this old school place i visited in Mexico once.   Staff - The wait staff was very attentive, do not think my drink was every empty. Our waiter was very calm and relaxed, thou there were people waiting we didn't feel rushed at all. The waiter was even able to help us create a meal for a finicky 6 year old.  To my locals, if you have not tried this place, put it on your radar. Thou close to the strip, the place felt like a chill place away from the hustle and bustle of a weekend on the strip.",

And tbh, when I saw the menu, I was immediately drawn to their vegetarian options as well.  I think I always find taco/meat somewhat salty so, I already knew I wanted to try their avocado and pineapple taco! And I have to tell you, I still think about their avocado tacos. I just loved the fried Avo and the texture.   And their churros **drool** very very very good. Crunchy on the outside and soft to the bite. It's how they should always be! Then they have chocolate and frosting dipping sauce on the side **DED** the chocolate dip was my fave!  Considering it was a Friday and my party of 20 with 4 kids was available was great for our family of friends! There was more than enough room for us and the kids even ran around the table after dinner.   Just note that with large groups, they don't offer split checks. So we all had to bring cash!",

It took about 10 minutes before being greeted and the service just lacked the whole time with her. She was friendly but def affected the schedule we were on.  She even dropped off our check without asking if we were done but we went ahead and closed it. We weren't quite done with drinks and informed her we wanted another round of drinks when closing out the food tab. She dropped off our paid check and we asked her to plz take our drink order bc she was slow and before her new table of 7 ordered but she didn't. She took their order 1st, punched it into the computer and then attempted to hand us another tables check, still no drink order was given.   Also the bar service was very slow as well  This place is delicious and worth checking out. I just hope service improves bc it this doesn't encourage us to return.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and generally, my experiences have been mediocre but the last time I went there was generally awful.   We were celebrating my wife's birthday and had a large party. We sat outside. It was a Tuesday so there were good specials on drinks and tacos. We had around 8-10 people at our table and probably another 8-10 at another table. Ordering was almost impossible. We asked people repeatedly to please take our order and they all responded with a version of \"we will go get your server.\" This got so bad that a couple of our friends eventually left and ate somewhere else because they couldn't order food.  Beyond the brutal service, the way the check was given to us was ridiculous. The server dropped our check and a couple of people in our party had left and we began to try and figure it out. It was around $400 and I was trying to figure out who ordered what. This is a normal problem for eating and a large group and often times someone ends up paying a bit more but we were looking at paying $200 of the check and couldn't figure out why. When finally went to pay the check, I had to go track down our server and he said, \"oops someone paid for there portion and the bill is actually $250.\" So then I had to go back and give people money back in our group who had chipped in more because our server didn't tell us that people that left had paid.   I realize that service to large parties is difficult and stressful but just neglecting us was pretty terrible. On top of this, paying a 20% auto-grat made it feel like they didn't care about or table because they were going to charge gratuity anyways.  I probably won't go here again even though the food is pretty good. The service was just too bad.",

My only negative is that the place is small! I had this same complaint in my undergrad when it was Fire Fly's. Somethings never change. They can accommedate 2-3 large groups 6-10 inside. They also have patio seating. Great for a date night spot. They also have happy hour from 3-6pm. If you don't mind being cramped in there on a busy day and you love music on then go on Taco Tuesdays. This could be a favorite spot for locals and contender with Pink Taco. The drinks aren't strong either or maybe it's what I order, the blended margaritas. I'll be going back tomorrow so maybe I'll try something new.",

I was recommended the chicken tinga from a hot chica and I also got the barbacoa taco. Both were very flavorful, but the winner is the tinga. Not necessarily my kind of tacos, but they were delicious.",

My first thought was that the tacos were decently priced at about 3.50 or 3.75 for one and some special ones going over that 4 mark, such as the shrimp taco. I got 3 and so did my boyfriend. We both got the chicken potato one, I got a shrimp one, he got some other ones that I don't remember. They were great! So much good content inside. The sauce for each one was delicious and was just so good. We spent the rest of the trip comparing the tacos here with tacos elsewhere and this one won by a long shot.  I would've given it a 5 but the waitress we had was a little.. blunt and just didn't seem to have much emotion at all. Didn't really feel hospitable. Other than the service, great atmosphere, great food.",

I also love that you can peer into the kitchen area and witness tortillas being made fresh.  Their happy hour food offerings are a bit underwhelming, but the drinks are a great deal! I opted for the Cadillac margarita and it was pleasant. I wish it contained a tad bit more tequila, but that's honestly just who I am as a person.  Pescatarians (like myself) are sure to enjoy the array of meatless options. They even have a vegan jackfruit taco. I personally prefer the rajas con crema taco. I usually pair it with the shrimp taco and fried avocado taco. The latter is a bit spotty, sometimes it's very good, other times it's a bit questionable (the shrimp taco and rajas con crema taco have never let me down).  We finished off the meal with an order of choco tacos. They're always perfect. The waffle cone/taco shell hybrid is a piece of art. Surprisingly, they're not very messy--when eaten with care.  Altogether, I'm a fan of Tacos & Beer. I wish the prices were a bit more reasonable so I could go here more often. The ambiance is on point and the staff is always super friendly. Our server this evening was Lily, she was incredibly attentive and sweet! Her service made a great meal even better.",

    "text": "Picked up my family at the airport and wanted to find a Mexican restaurant near the airport so we went here. I made reservations which I suggest anywhere if possible on a Sat. Night anywhere in Las Vegas. It was a cool funky decor and nice atmosphere overall. I got the 3 tacos. Carne asada and shrimp. They were small to average size street type tacos and tasted good. The margaritas however were very small and they weren't even filled up-when you're paying $10-$14 per margarita you expect the glass to be filled or looked like it was missing 2 inches of drink so that was disappointing. It was ok but def not a lot of alcohol Tho so if you want strong margs they weren't it. But  the food was pretty tasty and besides our waitress forgetting my guests sour cream and he waited and we asked numerous people 3x...which was frustrating-it was a decent experience. However when a customer specifically says NO Crumbled Mexican cheese and sour cream on the side-don't bring no sour cream and put crumbed cheese all over the meal. That was a bit frustrating. If those issues didn't occur I would have given a higher score. Having to pay for chips and salsa is usually a deal breaker bc we always eat lots of chips & salsa. You have to pay @$2.99 and you only get small amounts of salsa and small bowl of chips-thankfully the busboy brought us more chips. Overall it was a lace I may return to in the future.",

    "text": "Good food, cute venue and of course, beer. Because I failed to plan, we didn't have any reservation for dinner on a Friday night... The first wait across the street was 1+ hour so we tried our luck at Tacos and Beer. Originally we were quoted a 40 minute wait. They took my name and phone number while we headed across the way for drinks while we waited (bar was full.) I got a text about 15 minutes later saying our table was ready! They pushed tables together and got us seated as quickly as possible which I really appreciated.   I got the veggie taco, pineapple black bean taco and avocado-potato taco. That's ranked in order of my favorites and oh my gossshhhh they are so good! And vegan too. Plus, they're only about $4 but they are small. We got a few pitchers of margaritas to share for about $35 per pitcher and some basic cocktails. The only downside was that we couldn't split the check at all but that's their standard for big parties.   Overall, I'm grateful they were able to snag us a table of twelve so quickly- it really set a good tone for the rest of the night. I've been here often for food but the pineapple black bean taco was a new menu item and it should absolutely be in your next order whether you're vegan or not. Thank you Tacos and Beer!",

Lil disappointing the hotesses did not have control of the wait list and was not doing anything about large parties sitting at dirty tables & seating themselves ( huge turn off to fellow f&b ) We had a small wait and needed a 3 seater so its trivial. We get seated grab some appetizers. Salsas where good. Chips where gross though. I dont know if they are house made? Cold, bland and hard. Ive had better chips from the grocery. Tacos where just ok. We each ordered 2 each Beef, pork , fish and chicken. Was not impressed in an understatement. Size and portion was nice , dressed nice. Flavor bland and dare I say old. We had leftovers a rarity with these guys. I went to eat them the next day and just felt they where gross, eneded up tossing it.  Servers are nice , host was nice , bar was nice. Beer menu chalk board and numbers to order are awesome and worked well for us. We loved almost all the beers. The fruit beer no one enjoyed but hey you didnt brew the beer.  Techno tuesday was fun. A techno tent with lights & some music outside. We enjoyed the photo booth and the couple selling natural wraps outside.  Idk thought maybe they where just having an off night. Seems more like via the other reviews they are having a hard time with quality control.",

Located off of the Strip in a random strip mall, this place is definitely a local's spot. They have an amazing late night happy hour with tons of food and drink specials. Some of my favorite tacos are the al pastor and fish. The tacos are decently sized and come with handmade tortillas. However, the best part about this place is Techno Taco Tuesday. On Tuesday nights not only does this place have a happy hour, but they bring an entire party to their restaurant. They have great local DJs tear it up on the patio outside. I know it's hard to believe that you can find a great party at a Mexican restaurant, but trust me you should totally check it out. Can't wait to rage again at Techno Taco Tuesday!",

I wanted to give 4 stars because they used to have these amazing street tacos that they took off the menu and have no interest in bringing back (best thing on the menu and super popular so WHY!?!?!!) but I guess that wouldn't be fair. I'm assuming it's because they weren't as expensive as their gourmet tacos (their main menu) but were way more popular so they were probably losing money. I would come here again anyway though because everything else is great. Just wish they'd considered bringing those tacos back!!",

Not very busy on the late night tip, but that makes it even more perfect for those \"we're hungry and don't want to spend a billion dollars on food\" nights near the strip.  My friend and I ordered the chicken tinga and barbacoa tacos, both of which where amazing. A real plus is that they are regular size tacos. No street minis here, so 2 filled me up quite nicely. Got some guac too, and it was perfect. Passion fruit margaritas hit the spot to wash it all down.  Service was great, even at closing time (2am). As a night owl who loves late dining, I highly recommend Tacos & Beer.",

Taste was decent, but I couldn't tell til it thawed.  -Chicken taqutos: again crazy portion sizes; fat, thick rolled tacos. Ends were crisp the way it's supposed to be, middle was soggy.  - Tacos: disn't take more than a bite of each. Fish taco tasted like a frozen fish stick, & was kind of fishy. Crispy taco w/ shredded beef was just huge & salty & greasy.   Obviously, quantity over quality is the name of the game here.   Waitress was overwhelming. We were one of three parties there before noon & she annoyingly showered us with attention, asking every 5 minutes, \"and how are things tasting?\" I was polite & didn't tell her.   I'm seeing a pattern with vegas eateries: as long as a restaurant doesn't completely suck, they're bestowed a near-perfect four-star rating. That rating system doesn't work for me.",

I went there on a Thursday and it was not very busy. We were eager to sit outside as the weather was just perfect, not a breathtaking view but sometimes it's just nice to sit outside. The server took a while to get to us and server seemed a little bit rushed. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. It was pretty good, not sure if the chips were made in house or bought. I ordered the margarita and the server kindly let me know they use \"foam salt\" I had never tried it prior to coming here and I was feeling a little bit adventurous so I decided to opt into it. It was more foam than salt flavor but it didn't really change the margarita, next time I would order just the plain salt grain.  I had one carne asada taco and one lengua (beef tongue taco). The tortilla was definitely one of the best I've had in town, other than that, the carne asada was too salty and it did not come with limes. The lengua was pretty good.   Overall I wasn't particularly a fan of the service but the food was decent. They do have an extensive beer menu and taco selection which I was impressed with.",

    "text": "What a cool place to enjoy a few drinks and tacos on a night you just need to unwind and relax. I saw Melissa Y. check in here and I've always passed it while driving on Paradise so I thought hey why not give them a try. I can certainly say this is a young hipster-y vive of a Mexican joint. Can't exactly say the ambiance nor the food is your Abuela's authentic Mexican cooking, but a bit more Americanized and modern. I ordered the Baja fish taco, veggie taco with chips and salsa on the side. I enjoyed both tacos they were both pretty stuffed. The guac was a bit more \"whipped\" than I prefer, but once again this a modern fix on the tacos. This was all I ordered and it came out to $9 and some change. I was pretty full, so I did get my money's worth. I didn't order any drinks, but plan on doing so the next time I come. I sat at the bar and the bartender was okay for the most part but was just kind of whatever. I can't wait to come back here with friends to enjoy our selves.",

Both salsas were delicious!  our server was great, fun personality and was able to manage all tables with ease.

Barboca was also delicious, but the shrimp one was just ok. My friends say the lengua and other chicken tacos were also good. Lots of tacos to choose from as well as other items. HH only includes 4 basic tacos and is better for drinks, but taco tuesdays is .50 off all tacos. The passionfruit margarita was super strong, but yummy. Would give 5 stars but server took a long time to take our order after serving our drinks and on the check the HH prices didnt show. When we asked he said \"again?\" Not sure if it was only that day and not to be cynical but I think they dont check before giving it or fix it unless you say something. Besides that he and the bussers were very friendly. Food also comes out fast.",

Needless to say I was in a horrible mood. Then Lily came over. She was so sweet and understanding of my mood. Her smile and positivity instantly cheered me up and changed my mood. She made amaze suggestions on food and continuity check on us while we dined.  The food was amazing and delicious (as always) and Lily made the experience and my day so much better. Can't wait to come back!!! #tacosandbeerOP #TACOTUESDAY #craftbeer #VegasLocals #localspot",

The only reason this is getting a 4 instead 5 was that we asked for \"guacamole with chips\". The waiter up charged $2 for the added salsa. We did not ask for this and being new to the establishment didn't recognize it as \"extras when placed in front of us. We now know for next time.",

    "text": "My flight got canceled due to the surprise snow storm of March 2017, but it meant that I could stay an extra day and catch the legendary Techno Taco Tuesday. I'm so glad I could.  As a beer fiend, I was definitely excited about the draft beer menu. There's something here for everyone, and they feature a lot of very good beers per style. I didn't check out the bottles list, but I did see it was large and likely also nicely curated.  Wait for a table at 10 was an hour, but we got a seat after about 40 minutes. It was very hard to pick tacos since they all sounded so good. My favorites were the baja fish and al pastor. The quantity for the price was pretty good, I ca think, at least compared to some other taco places I've visited while in Vegas.  The TTT event itself was a lot of fun ($5 cover). I was impressed by the line up, and really dug the DJs, especially the dark techno. The headliner, Hito, got on at 1am, and she vitalized the packed crowd. Generally, other patrons were courteous and not too pushy, though some people commanded a large space for their dancing. Nonetheless, it was a memorable night and a great spot to dance with locals. The vibe is truly \"come as you are\" and mostly in their 20s.  Definitely check out this spot for the techno scene and some delicious drinks and eats.",

I will definitely dine here again because of how professional the staff were during an electrical outage.",

Flavoring was on point but  my food came out cold. I also asked for no potatoes in my crunchy taco because i'm allergic. Food finally arrived and I bit into it and my mouth instantly began to tingle I had them take the tacos back for new ones and they still came back cold ( this time with no potatoes). So I coughed the rest of the time waiting for my throat to clear up. I also ordered clinatro  lime rice it was good and flavorful but also cold. We set next to the front window it's small inside not much to look at but I'd recommend this place",

    "text": "I really like the design of the restaurant, very rustic and industrial, along with the twinkle lights. A great ambience always seems to make the food more enjoyable. I had the chicken enchiladas. They were delicious!   There are only 2 things to watch out for:   1) If you want great service and the food to be at its full potential, be smart by trying to go at less busier times. That's a rule of thumb for any restaurant anywhere.   2) It's a shame, I wish this restaurant was in a better location. Outside of the restaurant (in the parking lot), there are a lot of homeless people walking up to you asking for money day and night. I wish the city could do better by providing them with simple necessities  they need to get off the streets. Every time I've been to Tacos and Beer, they walk up to my friends and I. It never fails. And they're aggressive, almost harassing you for money. The thing is, not a lot of people carry cash now a days. And although I wish the homeless well, I don't trust anyone. (Especially when I'm a female walking fast and alone in the parking lot at night, trying to meet my friend in the restaurant.) You never know what somebody's True intentions are, whether they're homeless or not. I'm not being judgmental, I'm being honest.   So, if you feel unsafe, try walking in and out with a friend. It's such a great restaurant. Like I said, I wish it was in a better location.",

The key here, I think, is the hanging out with friends and beer part; while the queso was definitely amazing the tacos weren't the best we had in Vegas.  Thoughts: Stop number five on the eat and drink all the things tour in Vegas. It was fairly late at night, at least for us, as we had spent the evening visiting some friends at their house. We decided we wanted something to eat, but nothing crazy heavy, and really wanted it to be a quick in and out.   Since I think it's impossible to eat too many tacos we decided to go get tacos for the second time on our first full day in Vegas. Tacos and Beer wasn't far away so we decided to swing in and give them a shot, especially since they were still open. It's definitely more of a restaurant then your standard taco shop and there were a lot of people there drinking and hanging out. Make sense because you know, beer is in the name. We sat down in their cool outdoor seating area and quickly perused the menu. We settled on sharing three tacos and their Queso Modelo after some opinions from our server.  It didn't take long for the food to come out and we dug in. The tacos were all very good, but if I'm being honest the place we went earlier in the day was noticeably better. The fried avocado was good but was just fried avocado, the pastor was good but not quite as flavorful and juicy as some of my favorite taco places, the only real exception was the pineapple taco. The pineapple taco was made with small chunks of pineapple that were grilled and then tossed into the taco almost like chunks of meat. I don't know that it would be a favorite taco of mine, but it was very delicious and was a sweet, cool, refreshing taco versus the standard tacos filled with meat.  The real winner here was the Queso Modelo! Imagine your standard queso but with a special sauce and ground beef added in! It was killer. Absolutely something I would come back to Tacos and Bear for. It actually got me wondering whether the thing to get here Is there appetizers instead of their entrees. Regardless it was a pretty good choice for a late night. And it might be something I come back to if I was in the area. I think there are better tacos around but still overall a really good place. And it's worth pointing out that they staff was very friendly and very helpful, and you could get in and out pretty quickly. Overall a good place to grab some tacos and queso.",

The 1st time I called before the kitchen closed they let me order my food so it would be ready when I arrive & could eat there after a long day of work. They were happy to take the order while I was driving & once we arrived our food was sitting hot & fresh out of the kitchen.  Luckily the rest of the place is still open so we were able to order drinks as well. I did this another time also when I needed to take my food to go then changed my mind & ate in & they had no problems with it. They have been very flexible!  Regarding the food, it's always been delicious although I have only been here for tacos & drinks.  They have a good happy hour menu & the main reason I love coming here is they have a good amount of vegetarian & seafood tacos. A taco could probably be eaten in 3-4 bites since they are the smaller street tacos but they are very flavorful! Fun decor as well. Definitely worth a trip!",

Pros -best beer selection in town that I found during my trip hands down. They offer full pours and flights  -Awesome home made salsas the green and chipotle were both outstanding, I couldn't stop eating.  -Tacos were all amazing - honestly some of the best I've ever had. I went with the crunchy chicken, pollo Assad and fish taco - all were outstanding.   -Easy parking in the lot and about a $5 cab from the strip  -Prices were super average not $7 per taco like you'd find on the strip  -Massive selection of tequilas   Cons -Guac was made the day before and wish it had a bit more heat   Overall, I highly highly highly recommend this spot whether you are a beer lover or just like awesome tacos.",

They forgot about the no cheese on the beans though, sad about that part. Only slight downside was the food was at a room temp level and not hot, so the fried avocado and tortillas got to be a bit soggy.   I got 1 of each - avocado taco, jackfruit taco, pineapple & black bean taco, veggie taco, plus a side or rice and beans. Holy deliciousness!! I was so happy to finally have tacos that were not bland!!! YES!!! 10/10 would order again but would prefer to go down to the restaurant and check it out.",

The margaritas are about $10, which isn't unusual. It's just small for what you pay. They could maybe make it stronger. It's not that bad because the tacos are cheap. The tacos are something like $3 each. The flight of tacos is about $10, so you can get a variety. It has several vegan flavors. The avocado is the best of these.   Overall the tacos have good taste. It has a few specials. Of course they have Taco Tuesdays.",

Found this place on yelp, figured it was down the street from the hotel so might as well try something new.. oh and the prices were pretty good for being off the strip.   Side Note: If any of you remember where the old firefly used to be, this spot took it over. Re-did the whole inside, so it took me a minute to remember which restaurant it used to be. They still have an outside patio. Also this place gets busy, so expect to wait a bit.   I got here before her so I put in for a table for two, inside since it was really cold out that day. Only had to wait maybe 10 mins for the lunch rush to leave, then we got seated down pretty quickly. Our waitress did however take forever to get to us, and in general she wasn't very prompt on checking up on us.   However the food was really good, I got three kinds of tacos, I wasn't too fond of the vegan carnitas.. but the other two vegan tacos I had were really good. I definitely would like to try more items on the menu. We also shared the churro sundae, which was quite tasty.. however the horchata ice cream just tasted like plain vanilla bean, I didn't taste the hint of cinnamon in it.   Overall place was good, gets crowded around lunch, during the week. Would like to come back here again, next time I come out for a visit.",

    "text": "Thoroughly, all-around, amazing tacos. And cutting-edge beer selection.  Tacos & Beer might as well be called a gastropub with their excellent selections in both food and beer. I recall hearing about their takeover of the old location of the original Firefly, which was marred by food poisoning issues, and I kinda avoided both of those for that reason.  However, I first learned firsthand about their products at the Hopped Taco Throwdown in June 2017, where I enjoyed some of the more delicious and competitive offerings amongst all of the off-Strip and on-Strip heavyweights.  I was determined to try them at that point, and I finally did return for a \"Flight Night\" (offered in partnership with beer guru Beer Zombies) in February of this year. The tacos weren't quite as memorable overall, but I fondly remembered the beer-battered avocado tacos for being surprisingly strong vegan offerings. Moreover, the total value of $10 for the entire flight of 3 tacos and 3 beer tasters (from relatively inaccessible Boneyard Beer of Bend, Oregon) was completely unbeatable.  Finally, I made a proper visit today during their happy hour. I was aware that tacos were $0.50 off for Taco Tuesday, but I was also pleased to learn that flights are available anytime. Incredibly, you'll get 1/2 off price for 1/2 volume compared to the regular pours; it's usually a slight overcharge, understandably. Whether it's 4 or 6 oz, craft beer connoisseurs will find pretty solid value for one of 19 rare brews from breweries that, today, included Finback of New York, The Bruery of SoCal, and the Barrelworks subsidiary of Firestone Walker of Central California.  More relevantly for this review though, some of the tacos that are permanent fixtures on the menu are fantastic. Cochinita pibil ($3.35, or $2.85 HH) was my favorite. It had a mild heat and an incredibly rich flavor in every bite. It was my favorite pibil ever, by far. Baja Fish ($4.25/$3.75) was a surprising favorite, perhaps outweighing every great beer-battered fish taco I've had in both San Diego and in Las Vegas. You can't miss the crispy fish and the incredible flavors in the toppings.  Carne Asada ($3.90/$3.40) and Pork Al Pastor ($3.35/$2.85) were both really good too. They're not the absolute best, but they're top 3 in town, respectively. The Carne Asada was a bit too smoky but benefits strongly from the refried beans, while the Al Pastor is a strong offering but simply pales compared to one local legend.  I didn't dislike it, but I was least satisfied with the Lengua ($3.90/$3.40), but it was also a top 3 amongst what I've tried locally. Delicious, tender beef was present in every bite, but it lacked just a bit of flavor in either the salsa verde or the meat itself.  I'm definitely going to have to keep my eye on the beers at Tacos & Beer and plan a return visit to try even more of their tacos. They are easily one of the best taco restaurants in town, and the beer is just the icing on top for somebody who's recently become interested in the vast variety of liquid flavors as I have.",

We were at a meeting at one of the Strip resorts and wanted to catch a quick bite before taking our colleague to the airport. Quick look at Yelp and we found Tacos and Beer in the space on Paradise where Fireflys used to be (they've moved to larger space next door).    At any rate we had a great experience. Excellent and expansive beer selection and yummy margaritas went along with chips and house made guacamole to start. We each ordered three unique tacos which were street taco size and all very good. Among the recommendations...Chicken Asada , Chicken Tinga, shrimp, grilled fish and Baja fish. I've had a Baja fried fish taco from at least 4 yummy taco shops in the last month. Loved them all but Tacos and Beer have the crispiest fish that still melts in your mouth with every bite.   Looking for a value stop with great food, close to the Strip?  Tacos and Beer is just right!!",

The inside is on the smaller size, dimly lit, with seating around the restaurant and at the bar. There's also a cute outside patio they renovated recently which is great option during the sunny weather!  The tacos here are delish which would be my main recommendation. They have an enormous selection to choose from - a few favorites are the crunchy, beef barbacoa, BBQ beef, and pork al pastor. For apps and sides I really enjoy the carne asada fries and corn salad. Corn salad is very refreshing and a small side pairs great with the filling tacos!  The service is always friendly. I've been there a few nights where they are slammed and the service may be a bit slower but definitely not complain worthy. The friendliness overall is consistent and so is their food - which is most important!   I highly recommend Tacos & Beer. If you get a chance to check it out, be sure to order a michelada!",

I liked that they had different flavor options like mango and strawberry. I also tried a couple of the HH tacos, the Chicken Tinga and Rajas con Crema. I actually ended up liking the Rajas taco better than the chicken, but both were still very good. The guac was also solid, fresh & tasty.  Another awesome taco spot with a sweet happy hour.

It's really uncomfortable if you have kids and the tables are over crowded with stuff. Would never eat there again and I love mexican food.",

The barbacoa, and al pastor tacos are usually my go-tos, and both are delicioso. Last time, I ordered the veggie taco, and it was so tasty that I considered ordering at least a dozen more even tho I wasn't even hungry enough for the first one. *Hunger is of no concern when tacos are involved. The mango jicama salad is fresh and tasty and they have a unique selection of draft beers which is fun for those who like to explore outside of the Corona bottle. And ultimately, the best part is getting to sit outside, eating and drinking and good-timing, on the patio just like the good 'ol FF days.",

Waitress came by and we weren't ready to order so she huffed off. 20 minutes later she showed back up with even more attitude and was really bothered when a friend asked about the desserts  (which aren't on the menu). I ordered a soup and when she came back with the soup and my soda her response was \"I lost your straw\" and never came back with a new one. I had to track the waitress down just to pay my $10.00 bill (soup and soda). I could totally understand if she was busy with tables since she was the only waitress BUT she had like 3 other tables besides us. I will give this place another try. Hopefully the wait staff gets better.",

Their tacos are ala cart so if you're a fatty it can get expensive, but it gives you the freedom to sample the menu. Tacos are delicious, I had carne asada, crunchy chicken and chorizo, all three were fantastic. The crunchy tacos come with mashed potatoes which may sound odd but was quite delicious. Also tried the carne asada fries and was impressed, great thick cut carne asada steak, decent fries and plenty of toppings. Beer selection is quite above what I expected, quite a few local brews, decent cider selection. Definitely going back!",

We say two she takes us to a high top we ask for a table or a booth she says there is no both available boyfriend and I turn around and see the whole row empty . We sat there our server came up and we asked to sit outside because it was too loud inside he was nice and said sure . The hostess came up again with an attitude and took us to our table . We ordered the food did come out super fast which is why i am giving 3 stars it was pretty good the michelada was amazing . The service I would give 2 stars at most due to the attitude and when we tried to get the check we had to ask 4 different people . Finally after 25 min we got it .",

    "text": "For a beer right off of Howard Hughes, this place could be my new after work spot.  Their selection of draught beer actually was quite surprising.  They had the usual options like Dogfish and Ballas Point that you can find easily throughout Las Vegas restaurants and stores, but they also had rarer varieties like Stone specialties, Evil Twin, and an extensive bottle list.  I came to have a few beers after work with some others and I guess we missed the Happy Hour, but supposedly it ends at 6:00PM.  My main complaint is the seating issue I encountered.  We had trouble finding a seat immediately so we decided to go to the bar and still put our name down for a supposed 10 minute wait.  20 minutes later we finally got seated, though we noticed 3 separate tables throughout the restaurant stay open the entire time.  We never got updates from the hostess and those tables stayed open (on a Friday night) for the entire 1-2 hours we were there.  For a nice beer with a crowd of younger, working class people, this is your palce near the Corporate sector of town.  The prices are more in line with the strip, however.  I have not been for Happy Hour and do not know the deal, but I would be back.  Just don't expect the service to blow you away.",

They tasted store-bought, nothing fantastic.  Its a shame since they're making homemade tortillas for the tacos.    My wife had 3 carne asada tacos.  She enjoyed them.  I had a shrimp, a baja fish and a chicken tinga.  I loved the baja fish, probably my favorite.  The chicken tinga was good too.  I wasnt a fan of the shrimp.  The shrimp were chopped up into tiny pieces and they were served on a huge flour tortilla.  The tortilla totally overwhelmed the small amount of shrimp.  The rice and whole black beans were good, very small portions of the sides.    We left full so all in all a good value.  Not sure if I'd pay 4.00 for the fish taco, or 3.00 for a chicken taco.",

We started with chips and guacamole - this was good although I've had better guacamole elsewhere. Our margaritas were solid although also not necessarily anything to write home about. For my entree I had the enchiladas which were really delicious with very fresh ingredients. It is worth noting the prices are very reasonable especially for the Vegas Strip area. Overall, great food and recommended although I wouldn't say this is a must visit if you are in Vegas.",

I have tried the chicken, the fish, the shrimp, and the pork, and liked them all. Chips and salsa- BOMB. Corn salad, 6 stars. Even the cilantro rice was impressive.  Want to know my only complaint? $3.50 for an overstuffed street taco is not ok, ever. $20 for me to have lunch alone, $35 for a Togo order for 2 people to have tacos? Seems a little outrageous to me.  However, if I like your food I am willing to spend the money, because I keep returning. And have no intentions of stopping anytime soon.  I actually want tacos as I write this.  The decor is semi day of the dead type. The service was great. The food, well I have yet to try something I do not like.  I expected less from this place. It's nice to have a place exceed your desires.  But there is always going to be that little voice in the back of my head saying, \"I hope this doesn't get me sick\". Maybe I am harsh, and I should have more love for the Vegas natives such as myself. I consider it realistic.  Please don't let me down!  Next time, I plan on trying the enchiladas. I will keep you posted.",

Tacos and Beer is a cute, chic restaurant/bar that is perfect for a cute date night or even a family dinner. The music is soft so you easily have a conversation and is appropriate for group get togethers.  We started with the frozen margaritas. Mango, strawberry and passion fruit were all amazing. The passion fruit was slightly sweet, more sour. They were small, not very strong. For $9 they were a little too juicy, not enough drunk for me.  Bacon wrapped jalapenos!!!! The jalapenos were stuffed with cream cheese, had the seeds they out so NOT spicy and were amazing. I highly, highly recommend them.  I ordered 3 tacos and that was pretty filling. I was pretty basic and got the carne asada, beef barbacoa and baja fish. The baja fish was the BEST. Best fish tacos I've ever had- next time I'm ordering 3 of these. They were stuffed and the fish was so thick, breaded lightly and perfect. None of that all breading, little meat stuff you get at other taco joints. This was a FAT fish.  I'll come back for date night, I'll come back for family night. 50cents off per taco for Taco Tuesday!",

Being a brewer I can be picky on beer.  The beer list is quite frankly one of the better ones I have seen in public. The service for the most part is great.  The waiter was nice and did his job excellently.  Taco Tuesday is cool because all the Taco's are 50 cents off.  I highly recommend the Lengua and the Shrimp tacos.   The only knocks on the place that gives it 4 not 5 stars are three things. #1) When seating us the hostess warned us we only had 1 to 1.5 hours to eat or they would ask us to leave so the can clear the table.  Highly odd and somewhat unsettling especially when the restaurant is 1/2 full at 6 pm on a Tuesday night.  Starts the night off with a bad tone, has you constantly checking your watch, and for an a la carte place like this it isn't unusual to order again after eating the first round.  #2) was the Queso.  We got the one with meat, etc in it.  It was OK not great.  Too much milk in it and the most bland thing we ate that night.  #3) Charging for chips and salsa is lame.  Just lame.  No excuse.  Lame.    Overall definitely a great place to check out.",

Our server (who's name I've forgotten) wasn't very attentive for it not being busy, however he was very kind. Our orders got mixed up and I ended up paying more then I should have for my one taco and one margarita because of it.

I thought the name was unimaginative and thought it must be a dive. BOY WAS I WRONG!  The decor was/is very welcoming. An upscale place. Where you can fit in with a Chevy shirt and jeans.... sitting around nice dressed folks.  I had a small appetite tonight, so I ordered the chiquito taco platter.  (Small tacos) You can mix up the flavors. I had the 1/2 dozen (by waitresses recomendation) carnitas, BBQ beef, and the been and cheese.  All were good.  But I'm a sucker for carnitas.  So those were the favorite.   The waitress, Mandee and server in training, David were very polite. Mandee was very attentive in her service.  Not only with me but with all her customers. Definitely a very seasoned waitress or just plain rocking the customer service!  David was very personable as well. I think he'll fit in well with this group.   The hostess was very friendly and got me a table very quick. (Was fairly busy night on a Monday too)  Now the creme' de' la creme'..... I absolutely despise guacamole.  Hate it with a passion.  But I ordered the chips n salsa. Out it came w the, assumed normal guacamole n salsa. No.... I thought let's just taste the green stuff. (My grandma always said just try 1st then judge) So I do.....and wow. All I can say at my 1st bite. The \" tomatillo-avacado salsa\" was amazing!!!! A hint of spice with a little salt paired superbly with the chips.  Since I moved to town from Montana days ago..... I think I found my \"spot\". Next I'll have to sit at the bar and try to see how the mixologist fairs.  Lastly..... enjoy folks. You won't be disappointed! #tacos&beer",

Also they serve their tacos in a soft corn tortilla that they make fresh as soon as you place your order! The staff was very friendly and attentive and the price was definitely right!

The servers were decent when they actually acknowledged our presence. As we waited and waited and waited for our bill and our server to come back in the building we counted the employees. Including kitchen staff and bar tenders there were approximately 15 employees onsite. They seemed to be more interested in each other than the customers. Some looked like they may have been off the clock or just hanging out but still went back and forth behind the bar and in the kitchen so it's hard to say. It was painfully difficult to get someone's attention. Mind you there were only about 20 or so customers in the place. We finally got our bill and waited another 10 minutes or so for someone to pick it up.  We even joked that it felt like a prank show to see how long we could keep our cool! Again, disappointing!",

Save yourself the trouble and just go to firefly. The food may be expensive there but at least the ceviche they make will be 10 times better than at this place.",

    "text": "Man, oh man, this place has some good tacos. I'm not going to lie, I'm always hesitant of eating tacos from a restaurant considering they will never live up to my exceptions seeing as we always ate them homemade or from the neighborhood taco cart. So, I would have have gave this place 5 stars BUT I was so bugged by our server. The guy came one minute after we got the menus and seemed annoyed that we weren't ready, he offered chips and salsa and then left. Which was okay but, 15 minutes passed and we were starting to look for anyone. My boyfriend finally stared him down and he came. Now to the food, the chips and salsa, man. So good and you can taste the freshness of the chips. As for the guacamole, pretty good can use some more flavor  no complaints though. I got the chicken tinga which was really good, just tasted a tad too much like an enchilada for me not a bad thing, but I wanted taco ya know? The chicken asada, yes. Yes as in GET IT. I loved it. Back to the server so, we didn't know what to expect so we order just two tacos. Now we're just waiting on that good ol' \"how's everything\" so we can order some more. He went to all the other tables twice except us. I understood it was busy, but seriously dude? My boyfriend said screw it since another 15 mins have passed and flagged down a lady who gladly came and we figured was the manager. She took our order and even asked if we wanted more beer. More chicken asada tacos, yeah! Finally, we were content and she even came back to check up on us after that. So the gist of that was, we basically only saw our server twice. Food great! Service meh, expect for that awesome manager? Lead? Thanks, if you're reading.",

Of course today is Cinco de Mayo and the restaurant was pretty full but it's a tiny restaurant so I didn't really see a reason to be neglected... our service was completely horrible.. I don't know if she was new or what but she was a beautiful brunette young lady maybe she was just overwhelmed... But we asked a server if she was news she told us no, so I guess there's really no excuses for the service that we got ... I'm not sure but she took FOREVER to give my husband a refill , To take our order, and even just to check on us .. The managers never came over to check on us to see how everything was either .. I mean if you are THAT BUSY you should at least see how everyone is doing .. But I'll go back again it's just I think I want a different server or maybe a different day would work .. The food was just AWESOME .. I had the shrimp taco and beef tongue taco ! Awesome sauce . With a mango Margarita!! I think that they just need a bit more training on how to handle under pressure ..",

I squirted a little lime juice in it which kinda helped.  as for the tacos, blah.  the famous crispy taco was pretty boring and the mashed potato was gag worthy.  the pork taco wasn't bad but at 4 bucks I'm gonna put it in the fail category.  finally, the barbacoa taco shared the same fate.  for a place that supposedly specializes in tacos, Imperial has a lot of work to do.  go try the lamb tacos at carson kitchen if you really want to be blown away.  and, they make their own tortillas.  almost forgot to mention the beer.  they were out of the one I wanted.  that fact, combined with the lack of front of the house service, and a mostly empty restaurant at dinner time, lead me to believe this place is in serious trouble.",

We were a large party they did an amazing job keeping our drinks filled, taking our order and getting us our food.  There were times you had to flag someone down but with the level of business they do there, the food was very consistent coming out of the kitchen and no one was kept waiting.  The food here is actually pretty good as well as the selection of drinks they have available for you to choose from.  The prices are very reasonable and if you can make a reservation or call ahead, I would certainly suggest that as it seems this place stays packed.  This is a place I would go back to and I would recommend for some decent Mexican food with a Tapas/Small Plate selection as well.  This is not your average Mexican place, I would say it is a step above the rest and they try their best to impress.",

The food was ok, the beer menu was more hipster than authentic Mexican, but the service is what earned the one star.   There's ZERO decent parking in the lot, it's very small and crowded by 7pm. We waited 30 min for a table in what seemed like a pretty dead night for early taco Tuesday. We went to the bar to grab a beer while we waited, the bartender in her grungy beanie ignored us for several passes, and when she finally got to us, she seemed annoyed and was very rude.   We actually discussed leaving and trying something else further down the block because of this, but no one in our group felt like re-parking so we stayed.   When we were finally seated for dinner, we ordered chips and guacamole, another round of beer and we all ordered a set of 3 tacos. I was really hoping for truly authentic when it came to the food, and it was pretty much white-washed. They were still good, just not what I was hoping for. Decent portions for tacos (I had the Rajas, Carnitas and carne asada). Didn't care for the techno dance club tent they also set up in the parking lot either.   This place came recommended from good friends at work, but I can't say we will be back or pass on such a good review. Pluses were definitely the",

On paradise by musashi sushi place and satay Thai lounge. We started off by ordering the ceviche appetizer. I ordered a super must have stout called the fruit beer. Tastes like Chocolate covered strawberries!!! Super on point. My boyfriend ordered the oxhata beer that tastes like horchata! Not my cup of tea because I'd rather have horchata the milky version, but what the heck right? Our \"entree\" meal, I ordered the carne asada taco, bbq barbacoa, and the crunchy taco. All three were so good, but I would have to say the bbq barbacoa is my favorite out of the three. My bf ordered the half dozen baby tacos which you can customize with your choice of meat! And a side of their charro beans! That was so good btw...it's one of their signature sides I believe.  I wish we came during happy hour! I would have definitely gotten more of the bbq barbacoa taco which is by the way...on the happy hour menu! Each taco varies from $2.95-3.95 depending on which one you order. All in all...great food!!! Just wished the prices on the drinks were a bit more reasonable. Would have to come back during happy hour.",

    "text": "Great food! Ive been here several times and tried lots and everything has been absolutely amazing. Why the 3 star you might wonder?   Everytime ive gone service is bad which i dont understand why when they are always over staffed. When i sit at a table there's a guy that brings you water, the server that takes your order and the runner that delivers your food, and in your 30 minute dining experience youve had 3 different people come to your table. And no one comes back to make sure you're ok maybe because they all think the other person is checking in.  Today i was frankly fed up with it, which led me to finally writing a review because i noticed its an ungoing problem. I went in around 5:30 sunday july 30th sat at the bar, bartender was chatting with some girl seemed like her friend. Didnt say anything finished her conversation grabbed some menus without sayin a word. I said \"hi how are you\" otherwise there would have been no interaction other then what can i get for you. We ordered our food, food came out and we got half way done with our food and i needed hot sauce so i then got up to ask for hot sauce because by now she had some other friends she was busy talking to.   This bothers me greatly because i am in the industry. Ive served ive managed and i would never allow unfriendly people to be in customer service. I understand life happens and it might not be your day but get your shift covered or leave it at the door. We are paying patrons that expect an experience when dining out.   you are handicapping your business with people that cant provide good service for your patrons.",

    "text": "Stopped by for late night tacos and a night cap.  Had four different tacos. 1. Beef Barbacoa.  Delicious, moist and flavorful.  The meat was tender.  2. Chicken tinga.  Super tender and moist. Salty but sweet?!?  3. Puerco verde.  Same as the barbacoa.  Moist flavorful.  Not too spicy.  Oh, and served with a handful of pork cracklings on top 4.  Pork al pastor.  This was my favorite.  I love the hot spicy of the pork and the cooling sweet of the pineapple.  And a small swath of crema on top.  Yum.   Only one complaint. The tortillas which are made in house, were cold.  I'm sure there's a reason for this. But I prefer warmed taco tortillas.   Would I come back? Hell yes.  I think it's a bargain. The food was top notch, and fairly priced.  These aren't street tacos. And they're not Taco Bell tacos either.",

I've had each of the vegan tacos and honestly can't choose a favorite. Their chips and salsa is an easy addition. You can ask for more chips for free but extra salsa will cost a dollar. The jalapeno margarita is great- it includes a light chili powder on the rim instead of salt which fresh jalapenos mixed in.",

The customer service was lukewarm and it was more about getting you to buy as much product as possible instead of giving you a good experience. The jack fruit was the best out of all three tacos but ultimately it was WET, just like the other taco I had that stained my shirt. The establishment is just filled with snobby people who think tacos are on trend. I was really disappointed by everything this place had to offer. Save your money and go to Tacos El Gordo, better tacos and they're authentic.",

Our server was Noehmi and she was exceptional. She took care of every individual at our table. The entire restaurant was busy too. All the tacos and other dishes came out in order, and to the correct people. There was a mix up with a taco that was carne asada instead of Pollo but it was returned correctly in reasonable time.   Some thing I will mention is they do not split checks, but will accept multiple payments.   Drinks I would like to mention is their Hefeweizen beer & tequila sangria.   My favorite tacos are the Jack Fruit Tacos, Crunchy Pollo (I THINK it had chicken lol) Taco, & Beer Battered Avocado Taco.   We were charged a few drinks we did not order but it was taken care of easily.   I received complementary caramel filled churros, whipped cream w/fruit, Hershey's chocolate dip, & horchata ice cream with a candle on a plate for birthday. It was delicious!  I could not thank our server and the restaurant enough. I had a great night, check this place out next time when you get the chance for unique tacos & a good selection of alcohol!",

He picked here.   I love the decor! The lights are main with the Jesus candles which is pretty cool!!! And there is a mural of Cheech and Chong behind the bar! Once again awesome!!!   Drinks- Some beer comes in tall cans so ask before you order. Passion fruit margarita so sour and tart that I couldn't finish mine. It was awful! And it's $9 for a small glass on the rocks! Originally I was going to order a cider but wasn't about to spend $14-$16 on one cider!!!   Food- Crunchy taco the worst taco I've ever had the meat is drenched in a sauce that tastes sooo bad I didn't even finish it. Shrimp taco had too much going on. And shrimp isn't whole it's pieces. There was no shrimp flavor because of all of the sauces. Best taco was the bean and cheese. It was actually really good and I think it would have been better plain.   Service was interesting. When I first came in. I said I was expecting someone and took a table. Ordered margarita. The nasty passion fruit one. I asked how it was and he said a little sweet. Liar!!! That thing was like drinking sour candy! And he kept coming up asking if I was ready. Seriously in 10 minutes he came up 5 times. And when my friend sat down asked if we were ready. I literally had to say give us a minute. Geez the guy hasn't even looked at the menu yet. Then he wasn't around when we were ready. Finally he came back and ordered. Two other people came up and checked on us. Then we waiter forever for the check.   Don't waste your time!",

Chicken quesadillas, Baja fish taco & queso fundido, and chicken/steak nachos were ordered. For happy hour, select tacos were on special, but we chose to partake in the $5 margarita deals + $3.50 bottled beers. The margaritas were ok, either too sweet or tart. No complaints on the food!

    "text": "Best tacos in Vegas! Not even close. Their fish taco is sooo yummy, great white sauce, nice fresh cabbage and the flavor on the fish is wonderful. Great crunch on the breading. I ended up ordering six tacos (they're a la carte) but reasonably priced. My wife had five. I tried the lengua, first time and it was pretty good. The spicy beef and the both pork tacos I had were really nice too. The service was a bit slow and inattentive, not bad but just meh. Also, the check in process and wait list was very disorganized. We didn't wait long but there wasn't much in the way of systems in place for it to be executed well.   All in all, A+ food with B- service. The food alone will bring us back",

    "text": "Imperial House of Tacos & Beer is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. They are located in a strip mall across from Gordon Biersch. Parking tends to be a ridiculous situation, and it's not uncommon to have to park across the way near the thai restaurant. Once you do get parked, you have to now wait for seating. They sometimes do and sometimes don't take reservations, depending on who you talk to on the phone that day. It's always crowded and we usually have to stand by the bar with some beers before we do get seated. Once you finally get seated, however, that's when the magic starts. They have amazing Margaritas to start with, and their chips and salsa and guac are delicious. Finally, you get to the tacos, where they have both great vegetarian options and amazing meat options. My go-to tacos are usually cochinita pibil, Baja fish, and Al Pastor. However, with the amount of times I've been, I've heard about or tried almost every taco on the menu, and there have never been complaints. If you want a more local bite of Vegas, go 2 blocks off the strip and check the place out!   PS: GO ON TUESDAY FOR TECHNO TUESDAY.",

The imaginative tacos were amazing and each one I tried tasted incredible.... especially the mashed potatoes in a delicious crispy shell. There really is something on the menu for all dietary needs, even just the picky eater. The atmosphere is awesome with the most amazing lights hanging throughout the restaurant. The staff was attentive and the food came out promptly. We went on taco Tuesday where they have discounted tacos!!",

Every encounter that I made with the bartender (there were three men behind the bar) was because I flagged them down. Finally, I was able to flag down a bartender toward the end of my meal. He asked me, \" Is there anything else I needed.\" I proceeded to say, \"yes, there was\" and he turned his head, ignored me, went back to the conversation he was having with these two men who were clearly his friends. When he finally got around to acknowledging me I asked him if it was customary to ask how a customer how they are doing and then promptly ignore them while they're trying to convey their needs. He apologized and gave me a margarita on the house. Too little, too late. I'd rather pay for hat I received and get the service I'm due. I have frequented this establishment at least once every two weeks since it opened. Not anymore. I have recommended this place to countless people. Not any more. I have taken out of town guests here. Not any more. Maybe if I were a man, maybe if I were white maybe then I would elicit some respect in the eyes of these bartenders. At least, enough to be acknowledged when I'm spending money at the establishment where they are being paid to do just that. AWFUL.",

The portion was kinda small though. Most Mexican restaurants, chips and salsa/bean dip are complimentary so I felt it could be bigger. Next we had the tortilla soup. It was good, but wasn't the best. It lacked garnishes like cilantro or lime that would have taken it to the next level. I ordered three tacos: the lengua, al pastor, and the grilled fish. I loved all three of them! Whatever they topped each taco with was perfect. The flavors were amazing! My boyfriend ordered the baja taco and that's like battered fish. That was too big and greasy, the only thing we didn't like there.",

    "text": "Always a decently fun and entertaining time for Techno Taco Tuesday's, but I've still no reason to come here otherwise. Each week, I attend TTT with a group of 7 other friends. Working in retail/customer service myself, I understand the importance of putting the customer first and leaving emotions at the door upon starting a shift. The fact the bartenders here always seem to project negative energy and place blame on customers for any dissatisfaction in food/drink orders is horrifying, concerning and an upset to say the very least. Tonight was the third strike for me & all I'd asked for was a \"Negra Modelo\" for myself and a Corona for a friend. When I was handed a (classic?) Negra I verbalized that I wanted a Negra Modela, and was told by the bartender that I \"should have specified what I wanted then.\" & I was completely flabbergasted and appalled. A word of advice: train your staff in customer service practices. I guarantee you'll see an increase in profit because they've cost and prevented your business from making a profit from *at least* 7 people to continue spending money tonight. Keep in mind that there are currently only 41 people outside. That's roughly a 17% loss. Congrats!",

Fuck this over priced place go to tacos el gordo and get authentic tacos more per order and cheaper and you'll actually get your fucking order.. How do you run a tapas restaurant and you can't get an order that consist of 3 tacos down correctly or even at all when the place has as many people dining as I can count with one hand.

I was so wrong about this place. It was fabulous!! Tortillas are made fresh right in front of you. We split a corn salad to start. It was absolutely bursting with fresh flavor - a little kick but not spicy - just perfection. The pork tacos are amazing - melt in your mouth delicious with a flavorful tomatillo sauce and a sprinkle of pork rind for a punch of texture and flavor overload. And those tacos are only $2.50 each for happy hour! Oh, and by the way, these are not tiny tacos - they are big, full of fresh ingredients, and absolutely made to order. Amazing for the price - even after happy hour they're only $3.50. We also tried veggie - with yummy pureed potatoes, along with poblano - with fresh cojita, chicken and finally barbacoa. They were all great! I ordered my tacos in a lettuce wrap which allowed me to sample a few more flavors as I didn't get so full on tortillas and they were fabulous. We can't wait to come back to this place.",

Not super attentive, but definitely friendly.   We spent $15 on three tacos and chips & salsa. I'm not a person who understands paying for chips & salsa. But I will say that their red salsa had a strong roasted flavor that was really enjoyable!  My husband got a shrimp taco he said was fine, but nothing special. And we both felt the same about the fries avocado taco.   However, I absolutely loved the BBQ Beef taco. Their BBQ sauce was nice and sweet, just the way I like it. It also came with potatoes, but not enough o be over-powering. And I really enjoyed the crunchy shell. I haven't had one of those since childhood and I found it really satisfying.   The patio is pretty great because it's not crowded (go figure) and they keep it cool with misters.",

The proteins were subpar (tongue in particular was pretty bad; fish was nothing special). And the combo of flavors didn't do it for me.   They charge for chips and salsa (altho price isn't that bad... Approx $3). We also got the carne Asada fries, which consisted mainly of fries and some kind of dressing.   We actually came for the house Sunday event which is advertised to start at 9pm. It hadn't started at 930 and we had to leave for something else, so that was a little disappointing.   Nevertheless, because they support good music (house Sunday's and techno Tuesday's, I'll up my rating to 3 stars).",

Pace yourself or you can be in trouble.  Not much more to say....just trust me and wander off the strip to find this place next time you're in Vegas.   (Oh, and order one of the vegan tacos...while ordering flautas, bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers and cochinita pibil and chorizo tacos. Cuz that makes sense.)",

I wish I would have been told they offered different salts for the rim. I didn't know until after I ordered and saw it in the menu. The waiter was very nice and available when we needed him. My friend and I spilt the guacamole as an appetizer. It's a very hearty portion for 2 people. We each ordered 3 tacos. I ordered the shrimp one, mushroom one, and carne asada one. The shrimp one hands down was the best to me. Since we were there at happy hour and taco Tuesday our final bill was very reasonable. I will definitely return!",

They have a good selection of beer as well. Their margaritas can be either on ice or snow ice. It is sure definitely a good spot if you are craving for tacos and sport.",

Tortilla soup was hands down best I have ever tried! So hearty and flavorful!  Loved our tacos I only wish there was more room in my belly for more! We will be back!  Decor was so unique and hip!!! And to add...the rest of the staff was very attentive as well!  My fave was shrimp tacos and if you go on Tuesday's the tacos are all 50 cents off!!!! Take a bottle of hot sauce to go trust me!!!",

Our server was good for suggestions.   So the tacos, WOW. I had, a shrimp, Baja fish, beef soaked in beer, and an al pastor. Shrimp was my least favorite but still good if you love shrimp. Fish was really good! Not too fishy, perfect fried crunch, the beef was super flavorful, and the al pastor was bomb. I tried my buddy's poblano pepper taco...AMAZING. Not too hot, but cheesy delicious. Looking forward to coming back for more!",

Had a cold taco on the plate (it came out cold), so ordered a bowl of rice and beans to replace it bc lost appetite for the taco...25 min wait without getting checked and the group had finished their food. Had to flag down the server and asked for them not to put the rice and beans on the bill and to not bring them out bc we had waited too long and we were ready to leave. Instead of an apology, I received an eye roll. And they weren't even busy!!",

The beer list was long and extensive but a bit over priced for the place.   The BIG disappointment I had was my michelada! As any Mexican knows, Micheladas are like our daily protein shake! The mix wasn't good at all. I asked for other sauces to fix the flavor and the bartender (nice girl) stated they didn't have any and all they could serve was the mix. I found it to be a big thumbs down. Definitely that should be looked into. Have Maggi, Wosteschire sauce etc....   Sucks to say but, the Micheladas at broadacres (Vegas swap meet) are more authentic then here.   Great place but expensive tapas in this area.   Review made 2/14/16.",

Service was a little slow at first but they redeemed themselves after. Now I can see why people rave about the tacos. They were fricken bomb! I was expecting them to be as good as everyone said and  they were right. The margaritas were really good to and I'd love to go back and take advantage of the $5 dollar margaritas. Good job Imperial Tacos! Aplausos!",

My go to tacos are the fish tacos and crunchy tacos. The crunchy tacos have FREAKING MASHED POTATOES in them! It might sound weird, but it's genius and so delicious. They have taco Tuesdays here where you get 50 cents off each taco. The prices are relatively cheap. About $3 to $4 per taco. I'm usually stuffed with 2 tacos. They also have the option to replace the tortilla with a lettuce cup, which is a good alternative if you're looking for something a little healthier. The dessert here is not that great so I'd recommend skipping on that and get a Margarita instead.",

We started with the chips and salsa, both salsas were really well balanced. Was looking for something on the lighter side so I went with the grilled fish and veggie. The potato puree in the veggie taco was flavorful and really filling. My husband went with a variety of pork tacos and enjoyed all of them, although he really couldn't distinguish between all of them. Finished our meal with the flan and churros. Both were very flavorful. The flan was one of the best that I have ever tasted.   I will say that the service was a bit slow. I did notice that the tortillas are all freshly made, which is a nice touch, but the chips and salsa took awhile to come out. We also had 3 different servers which was a bit confusing.",

It was pretty empty for lunchtime on a Saturday so we sat right down.   I ordered 3 different tacos: beer battered mahi mahi, pork with pineapples, and a crunchy beef taco with mashed potatoes (yes mashed potatoes). All were amazing but my fav was the pork. It was difficult to narrow it down to just three tacos so I'm definitely coming back for the rest.   Do not leave here without getting the churros! Next time I'm eating those first. Came with a chocolate dipping sauce and some fresh whipped cream...I almost died it was so good.   The kids ordered the quesadilla that came fried, they weren't too excited about it and the waiter noticed this without us saying a word and brought out a regular quesadilla on the house for each of them. Overall the service and the food was wonderful! Already planning my next visit.",

    "text": "My husband had scouted this place out and we remember it as \"the old Firefly\". One thing that reels us in is Happy Hour - and a late one at that. The late night Happy Hour is especially great because it's a great pitstop after being on the Strip. It's 11-2 AM every day.   The food is amazing. I find it to have flavors way better than any other taco I have ever tasted. The service was also great - your drinks and water are always getting filled and multiple people come by to check on you. The tacos are $2 each and we tried most all of them on the Happy Hour Menu.   We especially loved the Al Pastor and Puerco Verde tacos. The Al Pastor has pineapple in it and that's what gives it such a bright and great taste. They also give you a starter plate of chips and salsa - also very fresh tasting.  We went back to the restaurant a few days later during their afternoon Happy Hour from 3-6 PM daily and again, it was equally as good, both food and service. We were checked on multiple times and never had to ask for anything.   The very next day, we told our friend that we had to take them to try Happy Hour. So yes, three times in one week. I am happy to say that we are so far 3 out of 3 in food and service. Amazing all the way around and I can't wait to go back. It's refreshing to have a Happy Hour that has really really good menu items at such a reasonable price. Three tacos and I'm full - at most four tacos.   The last time I was there - also tried the Churros. Delish!!!",

I decided to try the chicken enchiladas mole with charro beans. I really liked the flavor of my meal, but the enchiladas were not hot, they were cooked, just not warm. With that being said, I still ate them.  I also tried a couple of bites of my husband's fish and beef barbacoa tacos. Again, good flavors but the beef was a little chewy. Kaley responded pleasantly when we provided the feedback. We ordered flan for dessert, which was also good, a lot of caramel in a custard with a firm texture.  Overall, I would give them a second chance but would ask them to check the enchiladas if I ordered them again.",

They have an amazing selection of hard to find craft brews. Everything from imperial stouts for my husband, to wild sour beers, and even honey mead for me. The general manager, Dave, knows more about beer than anyone I've ever met. He was kind enough to introduce us to, what are now, several of our favorite beers!  And the food is absolutely delicious! Chips and guacamole are great. Oh and the beer cheese dip is ridiculous. We've tried most of the tacos and love them all. Our favorites are; the crunchy tacos with mash potatoes, the puerco verde with pork rinds, the beef adobada, and the pork al pastor. The flautas are also great! We have also eaten dessert there, and my goodness, the flan is amazing, definitely the best flan I've ever had. The churros are really great as well.

Great ambiance, great music, great service.",

    "text": "Absolutely delicious! :) My friend and I got off of work and were looking for a new place to have a few drinks. I saw the Tacos and Beer sign and the appeal was instant.   The place itself has a great ambiance. Very welcoming and bartender was friendly. The food was great. I had to order more.. I had the beef adobado and the green pork. I also had the beer batter fish. Yum!!!  Margarita was delicious! I love the salt foam with tajin. that adds a great kick to it. Nachos were not all that great though.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to the Happy Hour menu was extremely limited. There is a great selection of beer and hoped there would be more options on the HH menu. Just four taco options. I had to order off the HH menu to get a variety of tacos. Also the bartenders were friendly but the rest of the staff was not welcoming at all. Sitting near the service bar, all I heard were the servers taking bad about their tables. I thought that was a bit unprofessional.   Regardless, I would absolutely recommend it to my friends!",

    "text": "Giving three stars because it's a local spot that has great wait staff, a good vibe and good selection of beer and cocktails. Food is meh but I like that you can order to fit your appetite. Started with salsa and chips. Do not order this. Bagged chips from the supermarket with \"fresh\" salsa that tasted like ketchup. Also had the crunchy chicken, carne asada, and barbacoa Tacos. The carne asada was the best, really good. The barbacoa had some sort of BBQ sauce on it, like Hunt's brand. Not good. Crunchy chicken taco was just ok, nothing special. There are a wide variety of tacos on the menu, this was my experience with three. If you want a good local spot that doesn't have the tourist crowd from the strip, give this place a try.",

I am not a huge fan of the tacos (a little to much going on even with a simple taco, sauces, seasonings) and I don't like the nickel and dime you mentality. It is weird that they charge $2 or something for chips and salsa. Then all the tacos have prices around $2-$3. The point is to sit there with some chips and salsa, scope the menu and drink your first drink. Instead you order, order again, wait and then order again. Seems drawn out. The entire menu is this way as well, which I don't care for. If you want something it costs less than $3 most of the time but two people, two drinks, tacos and 2 appetizers was $50 pre tip, and i wasn't exactly full. I think the format works with their other restaurant (Fire Fly) serving tapas, but with tacos it feels odd with tapas tacos.",

Greeted at the entrance with a friendly smile and seated quickly on a Thursday night. Our waiter was very friendly and provided excellent service all the way through our stay. Since Im a vegetarian, I was worried about my options but the veggie taco just blew me away with the delicious flavors that I ended ordering 2 more tacos.. We also had the chips and salsa which was just as good as we added some of the salsa to our tacos just to kick it up a notch.. The ambiance is perfect for my flavor, very chill with low lighting,, cool background music and nice modern mexican-latin decor.. Tacos & Beer in now a standard for me to stop by when Im in town as I will be checking out the Techno Tuesdays/ house music on Sundays..  Stop in for some chill eats, drinks, and beats...",

    "text": "Enchiladas and mimosas. Burritos and bloody Mary's. Tostadas and Martinis. These are all Mexican food and alcohol combinations that you're not going to be eating here, because when a place is called tacos and beer then you better order some tacos and beer. Capiche? Now when I hear tacos and beer, I was expecting a tiny little place with 3 types of tacos and some cervezas. I walk into this place and was immediately taco slapped in the nostrils with some sweet sweet smells. Me and my crew had tacos going up..on a Tuesday and these tacos so good, we ain't choosy. These tacos here are well made you can tell they pay attention to detail. My two favorites were the chicken tinga and the al pastor. I also got to try the shrimp, the fish and carne Asada. All sorts of delicious and I can honestly say this was the first time I've had mashed potatoes in a burrito, so I tip my sombrero to you.  As you, my astute reader, have noticed, I haven't mentioned the beer part of tacos and beer. Worry not, because they hold it down. I expected a few beers, but this place had a whole book for beers, I only got to down a few IPAs and some tequila shots, because when life hands you lemons, pretend they're limes and do tequila shots. If you're a beer nerd then come right on down They have a few other menu items like tamales and enchiladas, and they offer margaritas. I didn't get to try them and I'm not bothered because if you come to a place named tacos and beer then you damn well better order some tacos and beer",

    "text": "I got the wrong beer three times in two visits, but I'm still giving the place 5 stars. That's how much I liked it. Everything: the food, the beer (when I got the right one, and even sometimes when I didn't), the ambience, and the waitstaff.  I was in town for a trade show and in search of good tacos and beer. What luck to find Tacos + Beer just a mile away!  Let's start with the food. I'm from Florida and lived in New Mexico for four years, so I've had my share of good Mexican food. This is very, very good Mexican food. You can get individual tacos ($2.50-$4 ea.), enchiladas, tortas, nachos, etc. There are about 12-16 taco varieties to choose from, and over my two visits I tried pretty much all of them. My favorites were the Baja (fried) fish and the Rajas con Crema (roasted chiles + oaxaca cheese), but they were all phenomenal. The tortillas are fresh-made on site (you can watch it being done) and the ingredients all tasted very, very fresh. If you're a cilantro hater like myself, they'll happily remove it when possible. I also had a bit of someone else's torta and it was very tasty if slightly soggy due to the filling they chose.)  Then there's the beer. Las Vegas is a s**t town for beer. Everyone knows this. But this place has a beer selection to rival some of my favorite places in Boston, which is really saying something. There are 20 taps and they offer a really surprising mix of local, faraway domestic, and international beers. In my first visit, for instance, I had a Tilquin Gueuze, a Tahoe Mountain wild ale, and a Ballast Point Victory at Sea. These would be great addition to taps anywhere, let alone Vegas. Lots of German and Belgian drafts, and even some from Switzerland(!). Reasonably priced, too.  The service was also excellent. We arrived on time for our first reservation but our table wasn't ready. The manager greeted us, explained the situation and gave us a free round of drafts (it was a group of 8, so 8 free beers). He also stopped by the table later on to give us some samples of newly tapped beers. The waitstaff were also extremely friendly, efficient, and accommodating. They happily handled split checks, despite our large party size.  The downsides? Either the bartender or the waiter mucked up our beer orders a couple times (perhaps a lack of familiarity with the subject matter, since they weren't like-for-like mixups), but they made it right quickly and without fuss.  Did I mention the place is really affordable? Fully belly and a nice buzz for $27 + tip. Can't complain.",

We were greeted by one of the owners, whom was exceptionally nice and overly apologetic for the wait. We had a group of 7, no reservations and arrived at 7:30. We were expecting to wait, but he insisted it was abnormal and offered us each a drink as the restaurants apology.  We got a strawberry marg, Dirty South Andres and a traditional marg which all were awesome.  The chips, salsa and gauc are amazing. I'm from LA. We don't fuck around with chips and salsa so believe when I say they are good.  We all got tacos. An assortment. We got a both types of fish taco, carne asada, shrimp, chicken and carnitas and let's just say it was silent for 10 mins at our table of 6 girls and myself while we stuffed ours faces and looked up at each other reassuringly. If you're in Vegas and want a inexpensive meal - off the strip - go to IT&B. 5 stars. All night and day!  The decor is legit too. Chalked full of kitschy Mexican art and candles. I was a huge fan of the taco chested Virgin Mary in the entry!",

Out of the three the fish was the best but it still wasn't great. Baja fresh has better fish tacos! I also ordered a chips and salsa very basic. The green salsa was pretty good.  I had a cold beer 4$ at happy hour.  All being said I was not very impressed and won't be back I think they're over hyped. There's better taco spots out there.",

The crunchy beef is interesting as it has mashed potatoes in it. Tasty and one of the people in our group would say it's her favorite. The beer!! Oh it's great. I love sitting at the bar with chips and their various hot sauces....just trying all the different types on tap. I think it's usually 20 awesome unique types...the bartenders are always helpful in choosing different types based on personal preferences of the consumer. I go at least once every time that I'm in Las Vegas.  They have never dissapointed.",

Although the vibe was a bit off when I visited, the service and the food was great. The waiters promptly greeted us, took our order and made some awesome recommendations for us.  Although went for the happy our specials (tacos and margaritas), the available variety was awesome and, for just $2 a taco, you cannot go wrong with any of them. Even the tacos that are not included in the happy hour pricing, are still very affordable and of good value. We had the tinga, shrimp, pastor, carne asada, chicken and pork tacos and they were ALL delicious! I am not sure about the rest of their dishes, but if they are as good as the tacos, you should be safe ordering anything off the menu.  Before ending this review, I want to give them props for their passion fruit margarita. It is perfectly TART with balanced sweetness, so it is incredibly refreshing. I hope you like it as well.   Central location, good service, awesome tacos, incredible drinks. Definitely a place I will come back to.",

    "text": "Experience:  I had a groupon that included chips and guacamole, 6 tacos and two sides, so I brought my girl to check it out.  We actually hit it during happy hour too, so our beer was a very reasonable price too!  Service: we waited for a few minutes before anyone greeted us at the door.  The owner or manager finally came over and seated us.  He did apologize for the wait too.  Our waitress was ok...she was nice enough, just not very attentive. She was pretty busy, so it wasn't the best service. I'm reasonable about being busy, but when your waitress is the only one in the restaurant and she's too busy, that makes me think it's poor management.   Food: the guacamole and chips were good. I ordered the fish taco, shrimp taco and the crunchy taco that has mashed potatoes in it, and the cilantro rice for my side.  My fav was definitely the fish taco. The other two were good, but the fish taco was great!   I ordered a Tecate, but they serve it in a can. I sent it back, because I'm not a fan of canned beer. I feel like the waitress should have warned me.  So, then I ordered a grey lady beer, and it was actually very good.  It was a witbier or white beer. It's my first time trying it and I was impressed. Nice and light and even a little citrusy flavor....perfect because I did not want to fill up on beer.   Facility: this is a cute little casual spot with some outdoor seating too. Would be great to sit outside in nice weather during happy hour for cheap beer and $2 tacos!  Overall review: I am going to give this a 4 star, because of the lacking service. However, I do see me returning to this spot for more tacos and beer!",

Crispy Taco is a really good flavorful ground beef, but a little to heavy on the mashed potatoes for me.... still, and excellent taco.... I will definitely order again. What is better?????

We started with the TNB salad, and had a variety of 6 different tacos. We had the BBQ beef, shrimp, grilled fish, pibil, crunchy chicken, and the pastor. The pastor tacos are out of this world good, for sure favorite. I strongly suggest trying a few different ones, and sharing if need be. Looking forward to coming back to try the hurache, which is always a favorite dish of mine when I come across it on a menu.    I would have totally given this place a 4 star, but the service was really, really sub par. We had the dozen mini taco plate, and two full size pastor tacos, and the bacon wrapped jalapeno peppers. The jalapenos were really tasty, and the pastor tacos were fantastic. The dozen mini taco plate on the other hand, was a bit of a let down. Our server did not indicate to us that the minis are not served as they are described on the front of the menu. They are served with just the meat, cilantro and onions. Not as they are described with specialty toppings that I feel make the tacos unique. So do yourself a favor and order the specific tacos in full size form, they are totally worth it.",

    "text": "Fact: I hated tacos UNTIL I came across this place!! I'm such a picky eater and I never convinced myself tacos were good until now. My friends suggested we eat here and already just hearing the name got me all skeptical because tacos AND beer aren't my thing.   Taking a look at the menu, they offer different varieties of tacos. From shrimp, beer-battered or grilled fish, to grilled skirt steak, bbq beef, etc., I completely avoided the taco section and got a Steak Hurache, but when I found out you can get a lettuce wrap instead of the tortilla it was game over for me!! My first round I ordered two shrimp tacos and grilled fish all with lettuce wrap. I fell in love with the sauce, it goes great with the lettuce. I knew I was getting full but that didn't stop me from getting two more orders of the shrimp tacos. It was bomb!! The portions aren't small either, great to size and worth the price. The Steak huarache on the other hand was forgotten, my boyfriend ended finishing my dish because I totally abandon it. It was a little dry, but came with a lot of sides.   Okay technically I'm cheating because I replace the shell with lettuce, but it's definitely a start! Ever since I left the place I've been craving it every day. The only downside is that it's a little too far and there's no other locations, but worth the drive!!",

I will warn you though...if you are considering the Carne Asada Fries...prepare to share or take some home...it's massive.

    "text": "UPDATE: My boyfriend and I have been coming here EVERY Sunday night for as long as we can remember. We've also come on other nights when we crave their veggie tacos, including on \"Techno Taco Tuesdays.\" Tonight is \"Techno Taco Tuesday,\" and I guess they have started a new cover fee program, charging $5 per person to enter the restaurant. Huh? I just want my veggie tacos. I'm not a fan of techno music at all. I am not here to party. We just want to eat. I've never before heard of a place putting an extra charge to enter the restaurant on top of buying food and drinks. Even the top nightclubs in town don't charge cover if you get a table! The cover charge amount is not the issue...yes, we did pay the extra $10 so we could get our food and drinks. My issue is the principle! They are taking advantage of people that just want to eat at the restaurant. They should just charge the people trying to party, not the people that are just trying to eat.   Old review: My boyfriend & I came in on Nacho House Sundays last Sunday night around 1am. We have recently been cutting down our meat consumption so we gave the veggie tacos a try this time. We each got a beef taco and 2 veggie tacos. OH MY GOD! The veggie tacos were by far the best ever! We both preferred them to our usual favorites. You know a restaurant is good when their veggie dishes are just as good as their meat dishes! The food is always solid here, and the drinks are usually on point as well.  I have complained in the past about the volume of the music, but this time it was low enough that we could hear each other while we were eating (at the furthest table from the DJ booth). After eating, we walked outside to the DJ playing some great old school soul music. I am not a fan of their Techno Taco Tuesdays, but man do I LOVE their Nacho House Sundays! We ended up staying an extra half hour dancing with everyone else I the dance floor. So much fun!!! We are definitely looking forward to spending every future Sunday night here!!!!",

I was hoping for homemade chips but they were from a bag.  The guacamole was good though.  I had a very tasty chicken empanada and a gigantic chicken burrito.  My favorite was the churro.  It was the best churro that I've ever had!  I will definitely be back again!  It's a great value for a lot of food.",

Vegan tacos for me, vegetarian for my boyfriend, and plenty of ones with meat and cheeses in them for our friends! Whatever you want me up ordering here, you're going to love. (Although I highly recommend getting the jackfruit tacos even if you're not vegan or vegetarian)  Staff has always been super friendly here, drinks are great, and the atmosphere is wonderful as well. If you have a chance to, you need to head here!",

    "text": "5 star for food-3 star for service=4 star because of good management.   As someone who doesn't eat meat or cheese it is generally pretty hard to find a place with good tacos. Yes, there are places that offer meatless tacos, but they aren't always good. Come on-- no one wants to eat just a tortilla with a few fillers. Tacos are supposed to be all about the vibrant flavor of a simple comfort food. When I found Tacos & Beer while preparing for a Vegas trip, I was thrilled to find out that they offered vegan options. My husband and I added it to the top of our list of places to go.  As soon as we made it to Vegas, our first destination turned out to be here. I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the coolest taco space that I've been. You can find candle holders hanging from the ceiling, sweet decor, and friendly faces.   I started my visit here by ordering the chips and salsa. Yes-you do have to pay for it, but the salsa is soooo damn good. It's most definitely worth the $3. Our order arrived shortly after ordering. As soon as the plate was served, I had the most beautiful sight looking back at me. 3 perfectly plated vegan tacos were right before my eyes. They include a grilled pineapple and black bean taco, jackfruit carnitas, and beer battered avocado. My husband and I already started discussing when we could plan to come back again during our trip.  Unfortunately, our next visit was NOT so great. We arrived with two other friends but decided to order our food to-go instead of waiting for a table. This wasn't a problem at all because we only cared about the food, not where we were going to eat it at. All 4 of us ordered our food and then stood by the door to wait for it. After a few minutes, my husband and I decided to go snag two seats at the bar because we were exhausted after a long day. Immediately the bartender(Karen or Kerri) rolled her eyes and demanded that we give her our ID's. As we were getting our ID's out, I smiled and let her know that we had just ordered food to go and that we wouldn't be ordering any alcohol because we don't really drink. She immediately got an attitude and told us that if we weren't ordering a drink that we couldn't sit there and would need to get up for someone else. I was shocked! My husband and I travel to many places to try new restaurants and do reviews and NEVER have we been told that we can't sit at the bar and need to give up our seats for someone else. I'm really hoping that this wasn't because we are an interracial couple. There were other seats at the bar, the bartender was still able to make money, and she was busy anyway. I'm not sure what the issue was, but this is totally unacceptable. As soon as the next couple sat down, she had a beaming smile and loudly welcomed them.   We requested to speak with a manager and the other staff members quickly worked to try to resolve the problem. The manager was at the sister location so we opted for a phone call instead. My husband and his friend (a Local) both talked to the manager on duty who was incredibly nice and apologized for the incident. They offered us a credit for a future visit, but we opted to not use it since it wasn't the businesses fault but an employees. It seems that the manager and other staff members do care about the customers. Overall the food here is amazing, but the service the 2nd visit really made us change our view.",

Our server was Allen(I went with a frat brother of mine) and he treated us very well. He was knowledgeable of the menu when we asked what was good and what he would recommend. The only problem I had (why they got 4 stars) is because my order came out wrong twice. Once on a drink order and another on one of my taco orders. I should be giving 5 stars because Allen offered to give me the wrong taco for free (he handled the situation very well) but the third thing that got me was the portion size compared to the price. I tried the carne asada, chicken asada, and carnitas tacos which were all marinated and seasoned very well with a good portion of each topping but the tacos were so small that if you are a big eater you're gonna have to order A lot.",

It's not groundbreaking and they don't have the best tacos in the world but the flavors are solid and I never have an issue.    On this particular occasion, my friend ordered a large margarita but received the smaller one.  The waiter seemed concerned but was able to convince us this was the better choice as the value for alcohol content is better.  He even came back with a half margarita to make up for the mistake, which I think was really appropriate.  The tacos are all unique and heavily flavored.  I'm kind of a purest and like my tacos to be more simple but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Tacos & Beer is trying to do here.    Being so close to my job, my coworkers often come here for celebrations, good byes and just to hang out.  It's a pretty solid choice for any occasion.",

She said it popped up when she was reading reviews, which is very convenient! There were still a few open tables, however, when we got there.   The decor is cute. It's in the old Firefly location on Paradise, but only half of it. I believe the other half is a sushi place.   We both ordered a veggie empanada and some beer to start. Unfortunately I do not remember the name of mine. It's on the fruity list, and came in a light blue almost Hawaiian can. Only complaint I have is that my friend had taken a drink of the beer that had been left in the can, and the server walked by and poured it in to my glass of beer without asking. I'm a weirdo about spit, so I was very turned off by this. The can wasn't even sitting by me. I know he didn't know better, but still.   The veggie empanadas were very good! I ate all of it, including the side ingredients on the plate!  I also ordered the jackfruit carnitas taco, and the beer battered avocado taco - both vegan. The jackfruit carnitas was pretty good, could use a little more \"umph\". Still overall pretty tasty. The beer battered avocado taco was my favorite by far. The avocado was crisp and not mushy like I half expected. Very tasty.   There are a few things I would like to go back and try for sure. Service was good, not too crowded, and pricing was good!",

Super disappointed  The aesthetic is very pleasing, from the Virgin Mary holding a holy taco down to the hanging candle lights. Too bad I didn't get a chance to eat there due to their poor service",

Also try the tinga empanada which my server suggested and it was beyond expectations! Definitely coming back here !",

They were not as expensive as I thought they were going to be, and we even shared a side that was pretty good. The beer part was also a good experience. I ordered the Romeo and Julius, which was pretty tasty. Although I wish they had more options, I liked the lineup they had. It wasn't too busy, and it seems like it has a pretty \"current\" vibe all around.",

I've tried all the tacos, ceviche, cocktail and fries. The ONLY thing that I can say I enjoyed was the micheladas! Well that's the only thing I remember I liked...till this recent visit. Jonathan was our server..I'm assuming because his name was on our receipt. But he wasn't a good server at all and he was rude about my drink order.   We were the last to join the table...and he came and took everyone's order and then just left when it came to mine and my boyfriends order. My friends even asked if we ordered yet...and we said no. He finally comes back around and asks if we want anything to drink..I asked for a michelada and he asks what beer I wanted, I said modelo. Jonathan tells me they don't have modelo and continues to tell me what beers they have. He recommended Dos esquis...I asked what it tasted like because I'm not a huge beer drinker and like light beers. Jonathan than looks at me and says \"if you are getting a michelada, it doesn't matter! You can't tell the difference!\"   I beg to differ, I replied back \"actually if you know a good michelada than you can tell the difference\"   I'm definitely not saying I'm a connoisseur by any means. But you can tell when anything tastes bitter or not good! So for him to say that like I'm new at drinking was actually pretty rude of him and to talk to any customer that way is not good service. And the beer he recommended was bitter and I did not enjoy it. So for the last resort of actually liking something at this restaurant has now gone to nothing.   I definitely will not be going back or recommending it to anyone for food nor service!",

    "text": "Not sure why I loved this place so much, I am still wondering if it's due to the fact that I was drunk. And I am wondering why this place has such a high rating -- it might also be due to the fact that we are in Vegas and people are often drunk too.   A few things I want to point out though; first, the parking is not a friendly parking lot. I was approached by some guy who asked me for money first and as I refused to contribute to his cause he became physical. Second, reservation is a must, unless you are willing to wait over an hour.   This place has the biggest selection of tacos you'll ever see. From veggie tacos to pineapple black bean taco or avocado-potato taco. You'll never get tired. Since I was with a bunch of friends we decided to ordered a large sample with pretty much any taco that was on the menu.   If I had to choose the best ones I would said the Al Pastor and the Rajas Con Crema tacos are the finest, although my friends and I had a hard time to agree on the finest options. That seemed a positive sign as we figured this place would make pretty much anyone happy. And for dessert Choco Tacos, so amazingly delicious.   The bar has a terrific menu too, the selection of beer rocks and the mezcal and tequila options will keep you looking forward to your next visit.   As long as you do not get shot at the parking lot you'll fall in love with this place. Just remember, make use of the second amendment and securely bring your gun. By doing that you'll be making sure you have an exceptional experience while not dieing while you go through it.",

First off our server when he was taking our drinks kept flipping around his notepad like he wasnt even paying attention which proved True because he forget about 3 drinks and my cousin had ordered a modelo which never came, then when we asked for her beer he informed us that they didn't have modelo. Ummm okay why wouldn't you mention that first ?? Second we tried to order chips and salsa when we put our drinks in and didn't even get those until our food was about to come out.   Third my husband had ordered a taco salad and asked for steak. Only for them to forget to bring it out but once it came out it had no meat at all. When we asked the server about the meat he then proceeded to say that he asked him if he wanted meat in it. Thanks for insulting when we already had asked for meat. The food was great but service was just terrible. We definitely will not be back at this establishment. Wish the service was better.",

We took a cab over and discovered this gem. It was fairly dark in there, reminiscent of a dive bar, but much much cleaner.  First of all, our server, Noemi was amazing. She was super helpful, nice and happy. The four of us each ordered some beer, and a couple tacos.  The tacos were better than average. My taco standard is fairly high though. I thought the lengua tasted a little gamey, but the pastor and carnitas were good. I also thought it a little odd that the hot sauces are chilled. We also got the queso, which was awesome.  Also of note, the taco trays can be flipped upside down to accommodate 2 or 3 tacos! I'm guessing other people knew that already, but it kinda blew my mind.   If you get time to head off-strip and want some good tacos and a good beer list, head over here for some cheap eats and drinks with no BS service.",

Umm, for starters we weren't greeted at the door. Servers and workers around glanced at us from afar, no one bother to come up. However the host seated us within two min. The restaurant itself is fairly small. It was not busy at the time. The lights were my most interesting thought about the environment! The setting was appropriate and matched the menu.   We were greeted by a guy by the name of Dennis. He we very quick and straight to the punch. Patient with me and my love as we had never been here before. He suggested a few things in drink and food menu. He was friendly and a good listener. My babes likes to talk peoples ears off so...lol   Long story short we got two beers and tacos with the a quick app. All which came in a matter of 5 min from each other. All of which tasted great. Tacos come single around 3 bucks each. We ordered bbq barbacoa, carnitas,fish and one with fried avocado. Super delicious especially with their homemade tortillas.   Lastly, we had a great time. Met nice people, it was almost two so even though we weren't rushed out it kinda felt like we had to since everyone wants to go home. All in all, good place to eat and chill with you and your friends or significant other. In my opinion, not meeting the hype or talk but certainly would come back.",

I do not care for tacos enough to pay that much but I was willing to give it a shot.  The service was quick. They were constantly refilling our drinks and chips, they never missed a beat.  The tacos I had were mediocre. Keep in mind this is simply preference and I just didn't care for these. The steak in my carne asada taco was dry and tough. The others were simply fine, but for the price I expected more.",

    "text": "I'm so glad I found tacos & beer the first time I came was a few years back and I hadn't forgotten how bomb it was so I definitely had to come back.  The restaurant is very nice very clean with plenty of seating with a very popular patio area as well. But since it was full we had to sit inside no problem. Took a minute for a waiter to come over but it's all good we're on vacation. Our waiter was a really cool and relaxed guy he was super helpful as my dining companion had a bunch of questions.  So to start things off right we got the house margaritas One frozen the other on the rocks. Omg it was soo good you can tell they use fresh lime or an in-house mix because it was so flavorful and not overly sweet. As an appetizer we ordered the chips and salsa it came with a roasted tomato and an avocado tomatillo salsa it was absolutely delicious and definitely homemade. It wasn't spicy which I was kind of hoping it would be but if that's what you're into this would be perfect for you.  For my entree I ordered three tacos  The barbecue beef, the Carnitas, and the Baja fish all were amazing! My favorite had to be the barbecue beef with the mashed potatoes shredded lettuce and sour cream all the flavors combine perfectly and the crispy shell perfectly complemented this taco. The fish was delicious too it had to be my second favorite cooked perfectly w/flaky fish and slaw w/the lime crema and guac mixed it was perfect together overall great flavor. I wanted to try the Carnitas because the pictures looked so good. I thought it was OK but it was my last favorite I think it was because of the chicharrones they tasted too intestine like. Which lets me know they must be fresh and not from the bag like I'm used to.  Anyway all in all I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "It's Tuesday and you're hungry!   After a long and hot day at the Las Vegas Comic Con, I was hungry for tacos and wanted a chilly IPA in my hand, Tacos and Beer, I see you. First off, the outside is pretty deceiving, like most Las Vegas \"snackateria's\" it's located in a strip mall with a plain look and minimal signage, but when you walk-in it's dark, cool (temp wise) and has clean rustic-hipster look. I'm sold already.   I went with two tacos; a Fish Taco and the Pork al Pastor plus, chips and salsa, and bacon wrapped jalapenos. The Tacos were amazing, the al Pastor was super tender and the pineapple chunks went with the avocado cream sauce perfectly, great sweet and savory combo. The Fish taco was not fried, but grilled which sometimes can lack in flavor, but this time around that was not the case. Flaky fish, habanero-mango salsa, and cilantro, boom. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for \"lighter\" taco option.   The Bacon-wrapped Jalapenos were huge and stuffed with cream cheese and came with a guajillo chili sauce. These were a hit it on all cylinders for me, even if it meant I would be paying for it later on in bathroom.   The service was fast and our waiter knew the beer menu very well, he even mentioned a few beers that weren't on the list, but were still available. If you haven't been here yet, the beer list is pretty extensive, so for him to memorize the entire beer wall menu and know the taps was pretty impressive.   Tacos and Beer, You have made your namesake proud",

I had nachos and they refilled it for free, as well as 3 different taco's which were good, a little messy but good. The Ceviche was awesome and I definitely recommend it to everyone who hasn't had ceviche. What really sealed the deal was the Churro dessert! it was an amazing twist on a classic for me and it was amazing and tasty. Especially the Horchata Ice Cream. 5 stars!!!!",

Even my many postmates orders have been prompt, fresh, and 100% correct-- an area many establishments struggle with because delivery orders are frankly a pain (speaking from a fellow food service employee.)

First thing I noticed, obviously, was the outside seating. Very casual and fun vibe to hang out with friends. Inside, it's dim with religious candles acting as ceiling lights, giving this place a \"dia de los muertos\" kind of feel.  I sat at the bar.  Comfortable bar stools and enough space to enjoy dinner without feeling crammed.   Immediately I was greeted and had a menu in front of me.    They have a full bar and a variety of margaritas, with happy hour specials, and Taco Tuesday discounts. I started with a Passion Fruit Margarita and absolutely loved it.   Great balance between tequila and the fruit, keeping the tartness of it.  Even though it was Taco Tuesday, I went with a Shrimp Quesadilla.  Excellent choice.  Generous amount of delicious shrimp, with perfectly melted cheese, and a small side of salad and guacamole, if you want to add to the quesadilla or eat on its own.    Before I was done, I had to try one more margarita.  This time I went with the Jalapeno one.  Another winner.    Drinks and food were great but, what I liked most about this place was the service.  I went by myself and not even for a second did it feel like it. The bartenders were so attentive, friendly and funny.  They included me in conversations, made fun of each other just to get a laugh out me, made sure I enjoyed my dinner...  5 stars all around!  This is a place I would definitely go again and would recommend to anyone in, or traveling to, Vegas.",

They a huge taco menu with over 30 different tacos to chose from. The fish taco is my absolute favorite. When I'm not in the mood for tacos, I usually get the nachos. It is huge portion that is great for sharing. I recently started order the Queso Fundito (cheese sauce with toppings and served with chips) and the Queso Modelo (cheese skillet served with tortillas). Both dishes are great as appetizers as well as for topping your tacos. Whatever you chose to order, make sure you ask for their delicious hot sauces. Lastly, tacos are $0.50 less on Taco Tuesdays!  DRINKS: It goes without saying, you should be drinking beer with your tacos at Tacos & Beer. They do serve pitchers of margaritas if you want to share with a group.  ATMOSPHERE: Service here always amazes me. I often go with a big group of friends. The waiters here never mess up our super long orders and they are able to seperate all our checks. The food comes out quickly and they are attentive to their customers. Once, I dropped a lime on the ground, within seconds, the waiter brought me a whole plate a limes without me even asking!",

    "text": "Definitely my favorite taco spots in Vegas as a local residents.   First, the environment is very fun. It's a great social spots to bring friends, enjoy delicious foods and hang out. There may be a wait time, especially on busy nights and Tuesday's, i would say reservation is recommended. Also they have techno Tuesday, you have to go to find out. Their decoration is also sick, with candles floating on top and some funny Hispanic artwork.  Second, the service is great. The staff is very friendly and the waiters never left me thirsty. The food and drinks came out very quickly as well.   As for the food, they have great sangria and margaritas, a wide variety of delicious tacos, my favorites being the Baja fish taco, al pastor, shrimp. Their carne asada fries is super good too. They also have a lot of beer choices, and a bar to hang out at.   As I mentioned before, this is one of my favorite spots in Vegas, whether you are hanging with friends or on a date, you'll have fun and enjoy some good drinks and food.",

Service was fast and on point with everything.  We tried a few appetizers and I can't begin to let you all know how good the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers were!  Off.  The.  CHAIN!!!  Crazy good!  Careful tho, the cheese on the inside gets scalding hot.  The waiter didn't let us know and he absolutely should have because I'm thinking the inside of my mouth is gonna be hurting for a week.  Still tho, good af.  The Queso Fundido was excellent.    All the tacos were fire.  My faves were the Puerco Verde, Carne Asada, and Cochinita Pibil.    Desserts were all excellent, but I have to say the my favorite was the caramel flan (I think that's what it was called).  I'm not the biggest flan guy, but I can't tell y'all enough how good this flan was.  Get it.  For real.  Trust me.  I was fighting my friends for it.    Service was A+ and the manager was the best.  One of the best of any restaurant that I'd ever been to I'd say...and he's been this good on multiple occasions.  Manuel, you're an example of excellent customer service.  My hats off to ya.",

The shrimp taco was bleh. Didn't like anything about it. Not the flavor nor the texture. My favorite was the fish taco! It was probably what made this trip decent. I wouldn't personally return for my sake but if my sister wants to go again I would definitely just order the fish taco.",

Also during their happy hour it wasn't too bad when I went at 12 am. Here's my thing, the wait was fine and we got seated right away. Once we ordered our drinks and tacos they took WAYYY too long and made no sense because our waiter decided that he'll do the other table who came in after us order wise and they got their orders quicker than we did?!! Hmmm I was mad and so was our friends, check this out?!! How are you going to bring us to a table and not have napkins or utensils on a table?!! Like that type of stuff should be prepared and ready to go for customers? Will not comeback and waste my time for a restaurant who doesn't try and put effort for its customers.",

    "text": "After a horrible experience at El Dorado Cantina, we decided to try Imperial Tacos and Beer -- wow, so delicious.   The restaurant has a great feel to it and from the moment we walked in, the customer service was on point. Our server was attentive and did a great job making suggestions. There are other items on the menu, but the extensive taco list is the only place you need to order from.   At $2.99-$3.50 taco, you can't go wrong and the opportunity is there to mix and match. My first round consisted of: 1 carne asada; 1 al pastor and 1 carnitas. All three were tasty but the al pastor and carnitas really hit the spot. In fact, after those three, I ordered another al pastor and carnitas. The tacos are loaded with meat and the toppings compliment them well. All the tacos are served on homemade corn tortillas and I believe that makes all the difference.  If you're in the area and looking for a clean, sit down establishment serving ice cold beer and tasty tacos at a reasonable price...head down to Imperial.",

While out for July 4th weekend in Las Vegas, we stumbled upon his Mexican joint that has good tacos and a wonderful environment.  Alberto, our server, was super friendly and made our experience wonderful.  I recommend the chorizo tacos...my favorite!!   I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good time and excellent food! Home away from home.",

There wasn't really too many good options but this place popped up on Google and that's where we went. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff (Karen was our bartender), just all around friendly people. I had a passion fruit margarita which wasn't that bad. Boyfriend had a regular ol' lime margarita which was really good. The chips y salsa was delicious, especially the green mild. Ended the night with a tequila sangria which amazingly was delicious as well. I'm from the Reno area and would definitely love if we had one in our area. Next time we're in the town, this will be our go to spot for some drinks and salsa. Thanks for the experience guys.",

Some of the tacos are really good, many of them are very average, and a few of them are not good at all. It's about $2-$4 per taco, and they are very small.  You will get one order of complimentary chips and salsa, and then you have to pay to have a refill.  I think I ended up paying about $12 for my lunch, and I was pretty hungry afterwards. The environment is very casual, with plenty of televisions to watch any sports games going on. I haven't had the alcohol, so I can't speak to any of that.  As far as the food goes, it's very average and you could get a much better taco at Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo. I wouldn't avoid eating here, but this would definitely not be my destination of choice.",

And the rest of the staff h I mentioned an unusual taco that I had at a place 100s of miles away and containing ingredients not even on their menu, in a few minutes two appeared on the table. Amazing flavors, and each type different. So often the difference between tacos seems to be crunchy or soft but the flavors were each wonderful.    Tacos are only half of the name though and the beer list almost out shone the tacos. Rare and flavorful beers from all over. Yes, you could drink the common mexican beer, but why when their are so many amazing flavors to try. With a 20 beer tap list on a chalk board, they change so often that naming them would be pointless, but the manager knows his beer so they are all amazing. If you are feeling adventurous, get a flight of six, 5 oz. beers. The bottle list is pages long and incredible.   Seriously wonderful food and drinks.",

I'd say they executed it pretty darn well~ fish was perfectly crisp and soft inside and their avocado sauce accented the fish well.   No-  don't do the carnitas - they were lacking flavor and crisp usually from being broiled. I was sadly disappointed by these soggy carnitas tacos and do not recommend.",

You have 1.5 hours for the table for HH but server said if it's not too crowded they'll let you stay for longer if you need it. We did not need the full 1.5hrs. We ordered and were served very quickly. Turn around time must have been like 15 minutes for a table of 7!   50 cents off all tacos. I ordered 3 tacos and was quite full.   I ordered the Baja fish, crunchy and al pastor.   Baja fish 5 stars: crunchy crispy fish with guac and other condiments. Absolutely delicious.   crunchy 5 stars: this one was my favorite. Crunchy taco with mashed potato on the bottom and ground beef. Mashed potato I thought initially was kind of interesting combination in a taco but ended up being amazing. If you get this taco eat it first so it doesn't get soggy.   Al Pastor 5 stars: pineapple and pork. Meat was tender and flavor was amazing. This taco was better than taco y taco or tacos el gordo to compare.   I will definitely be frequenting this place more often! great job all around service and food!",

Even the vegetarian tacos with fried avocado were to die for, and i only ordered them because i wanted to try them. Im not a vegetarian, and id order those again! My goal is to try every taco on the menu!",

    "text": "This place has a huge selection of tacos and beer (big surprise given the name, huh?). It was actually pretty good over all, though this isn't the place to go if you just like good simple street tacos. This place definitely targets the hipster/trendy crowd, and the menu (and prices) reflect that.  The menu has at least twenty types of tacos, ranging from the basics to more fusion style. The have carne asada, the classic crunchy taco, carnitas, al pastor, etc... along with unusual things like bbq beef. By far their most original creations were their vegan tacos, which actually blew me away (at least the ones we tried).  Since this was our first time here my wife and I ordered way too many tacos to sample their menu. It was taco Tuesday, so all the tacos were 50 cents off. The tacos range in price from $2.70 to $3.70, which seemed a little pricy. However, when the tacos arrived I was surprise by how large they were, so they are worth the price. It was obvious upon their arrival that we had over ordered, as all the tacos also had good portions of meat in them instead of piles of lettuce and other toppings.  The tacos themselves were a mixed bag. We tried 14 (yes, I know that's way too much for two people) different tacos. I loved the carne asada, though my wife didn't. I also really liked the chicken Asada and their vegan tacos blew me away. In particular their jackfruit carnitas taco was amazing! I would have sworn it was meat! The flavor was awesome and if your vegan or vegetarian you have to check this place out. My wife and I both agreed that our favorite taco was the pork shoulder though, which will be a must have every time we return here in the future.  There were only a few tacos we didn't care for. The crunchy chicken and bbq beef were both disappointing. The bbq sauce was too sweat and the both these tacos had mashed potatoes at the bottom, which just didn't work. We also didn't care for the chili verde, which was two stringy and the green sauce was overpowering.  One other thing I should point out I didn't like, and its something simple. First of all, I have never liked Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa, but if you do, they should at least be good. The chips tasted like they came out of any bag you bought at a grocery store and their salsas were blah. Right before our tacos came out they brought out three bottles of home made sauces, which were far better than the salsa. The sauces should have just come out with the chips to make them better. For a place that is supposed to be higher end they really should have been better.  I almost forgot, we got the Choco Tacos for desert. You get two desert tacos for $5, and they were so worth it! They were homemade with horchata ice cream (which tasted like homemade vanilla, which is a compliment). This was a highlight of our meal. I highly recommend them. A perfect desert for two people.  Their beer selection was a nice selection of craft, with most beers in the $6 to $8 range. If your into craft, and don't mind the slightly high price, this is a good place to check out.  So in summary, if you want to check out a higher end taco shop, this is a decent place. Don't get the chips and salsa and don't be afraid to try the amazing vegan tacos.",

I had a traditional margarita which was really good and strong. They have many beers and liquors to choose from. I had a Baja taco and a pork al pastor taco and both were really good. The Baja taco was the best, especially the slaw on top! The fish was freshly fried and piping hot when it got to my table and the fish combined with the slaw and Pico de Gallo was the perfect balance of flavors.  My husband got the lengua, chicken Asada, and BBQ beef and he said all were really good. If your visiting Vegas and are able to get off the strip, I definitely recommend making the drive to this place.",

If you are local, it's where the old Firefly was located.  I'll start by saying this: Don't fill up on starters. The Guac crab and mango starter is great but is filing.  The tacos here are great, sampling variety from Crunchy to Baja Fish but the one the I can recommend is the Verde Pastor. Plenty of flavor with an interesting combo of ingredients. The servings are a little bigger than your regular street tacos so don't worry you won't be hungry later.  The beer selection is extensive. The menu has most of the beers broken down into simply categories that are easy to follow. If you want an updated beer menu check the blackboard beside the bar.  As for the service, our busser and host were awesome. The busser took our orders and recommend different tacos. The sever wasn't really around that much.  The hostess was amazing, she had a very extensive knowledge of beer and was amazing in recommending. Management better change her to the bar or someone is going to scoop her up!

    "text": "Wow.  SO...Finally getting a chance to write about this spot since the change over from Firefly. Ok, here's what was good. The food tasted right, nothing muddied in the flavors and clean executions with seasoning. \"Mexican\" style food can often get a lil crammed in with too much going on. You can tell that quality marinades, and proper prep work went into the grub here. The beer selection is really good. Always a steady rotation of quality beer and good drinks.   Here's what's often not good : the service. I have actually had servers that have been employed there since it was the previous restaurant - Firefly - tell me that they were new employees. They did this because they had forgotten orders. Not ordered our food .. And in one event, the server was dancing in front of the Dj while we waited for our check for over 15 minutes.   Telling the manager about the issue did nothing. The manager was combative with us trying to defend the servers mistakes when we asked for nothing other than the check.  The tall Latino, male night manager we dealt with, went so far as to lie and say we had been using profanity against the server - as if to say that any other mistake made by the server - was invalid. No such thing happened.   I want to support local business and I wanted to be a regular diner at this establishment. That kind of behavior is unacceptable.   So if you go check it out - maybe lunch is a better option. Happy eating to you !!",

They have a full bar as well and its a really great little party spot. They had a huge TV while the World Series was going on so it was a great atmosphere, almost sports-barish. On to the food: They had a great menu with everything Mexican with an American touch. The tacos were great and the enchiladas were among the best I've had. If you're a craft beer fan then this is a must stop for a calm location away from the strip.",

    "text": "I'm giving this establishment 3 stars, not because I didn't like the food and drinks, but because of it's particular choices in decoration:  FOR THE FOOD: 3.5 STARS The tacos were unique, but it doesn't beat the original Mexican taco places around Las Vegas. I don't like how some tacos use ground beef or pork (ex. the al pastor) tacos. Overall, the tacos tasted good, and I particularly liked the vegetarian tacos a lot. The refried beans were awesome! The drinks are TOO EXPENSIVE for what they provide. $8 for a margarita, I had assumed that it would at least come in a tall glass, but instead, it comes in a small 8 oz. glass.  FOR THE SERVICE: 5 STARS The service was perfect. Our server was very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Only criticism, was that, every time we have gone there, there was always been one missing taco. Every time. Maybe it's just a miscommunication.  FOR THE DECORATION: 1 STAR Some of the stuff is questionable. I like the unique pop culture components. However, the religious components mixed with the alcohol theme is tasteless. Even for non-religous customers, it can be offending and disrespectful, because it is blasphemy. I hope the artists of the restaurant reconsider their theme. I think it's particularly disrespects a religion when you have Mother Mary eating a taco and being surrounded with alcohol. Not to be one of those overly sensitive trolls that get \"offended\" with everything, but I like to courteous of other beliefs. If that done to others, I am sure it would be very disappointing to them as well.",

Not only do you have to pay for chips and salsa you get maybe 10 chips. The guacamole was nothing special, and neither was the salsa. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican place, this is not the place. Go to somewhere on the strip, you will be paying the same prices with better people watching.",

Apparently my friends had invited a bunch more friends too because we ended up having a big table for probably 12-15 people. Now I have to say that when approaching this place I wasn't really feeling the vibe, it's pretty much a bunch of people hanging out in a parking lot on the outside, but inside was much more inviting and more my scene. Our table was right when you walk in, the air conditioner was blasting so I was freezing initially, but luckily I brought a jacket or else that may have made me miserable. The music was loud like other reviewers have mentioned, it could definitely have been a bit lower so we could talk to each other without yelling, but the music they were playing was good, I liked it. Chips and salsa were good, my margarita was pretty standard, my boyfriend's Jalapeno Margarita was delicious! I got 2 of the Chicken Tinga tacos and they were awesome!! I really loved them, the best part was the texture of the tortilla, it was perfect. I could have easily eaten another taco or 2 but we had to take off, and I was comfortably full with all the chips and salsa. Service was decent, and our bill for the 2 of us where we had 2 happy hour margaritas and 6 tacos total was $33- a good deal! I'll definitely check this place out again for Taco Tuesday, but only if I can sit inside :)",

The music and the atmosphere was seriously a lot of fun. Great vibe. Everyone was dancing on the patio while inside the restaurant it was not too loud and the ambiance was nice so you could enjoy your dinner and have conversation too. We had a great time.
