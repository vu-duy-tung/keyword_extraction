(Which is helpful because the wraps, 'while delicious' could not be messier to eat) the hummus is great. The proteins are not super authentic, but they are still DELICIOUS!!! And all the toppings and the sauces are incredible. Everything has its own unique flavor that adds a different layer of flavor. 1000% I WILL BE BACK!!! Good job!!!",

Nice fresh food and we knew we had eaten with no processed after tastes which you get at other similar restaurants.

But for driving from southwest to Henderson, this restaurant did not disappoint.   First, you choose whether you want a bowl or a wrap. And we both chose a bowl, because why not? This is a make-your-own spot so it's great to play around with the ingredients.   I got the classic hummus with salad, white rice, beans, and lamb. My mistake was getting the tzatziki because they drench your bowl making it look unappetizing, but that was the least of my complaints. It was delicious, flavorful, and filling with all the individual ingredients that worked harmoniously well together.   The interior of this place was clean and modern which almost reminded me of a cafe rather than a restaurant. It's the perfect place to have lunch with good friends!   Now, the boiling question of the day: would I come back? Yes!",

The server helped me pick a couple of those. Very friendly staff. Trendy decor. Delicious food. Now if we could just get one of these in the NW valley. Highly recommend this place. I will be back.",

    "text": "Really confused by these ratings. Individually everything I'm sure tastes great but with that many ingredients honestly it becomes one big mixture of food and you no longer taste individual taste of each item in the bowl. He first couple bites you can taste things but after a while it all tastes the same which is disappointing considering each topping probably tasted good on it's own. I'm probably just not a fan of this all you can top it with type of food. There are so many great choices here to add to your bowl. I absolutely love the concept and this is my favorite type of food as well so I thought what could go wrong? Customer service was great and he even asked how I liked the food afterwards.   Well what went wrong then? I was stuck in the bathroom for hours afterwards. I'm not sure if it was food poisoning or just ate something bad there, but either way I did not enjoy the feeling after eating there. Not good at all.   The 2 stars are for the concept and the customer service but minus a few stars for the toilet issue and the mixture of food.",

You have 2 options bowl or wrap. I'd pick bowl if your a tad hungrier. Hummus, greens, protein, and unlimited toppings made for a very hearty meal. It was my first meal of the day at noon and kept me full until 7pm! I also gave the cinnamon twist pita fries with peanut butter hummus a go and was impressed with flavor, just not so much texture. The pita fries where I expected them to be soft were hard. But overall i felt like this was a delightful meal satisfying and refreshing. Its far from where i live but i will definitely make the drive!",

So yes, definitely had second thoughts on trying this place out.   But wow, let me tell you. After my first bite of my custom made bowl with spicy hummus, I am now a fan of hummus lol.. this place is delicious! Their ingredients taste fresh, and the bold flavors with each bite .. yum! The 5 star reviews on this place.. much earned. Great place, affordable, and lots of food for your buck!  Try the pita fries dipped in their chili harissa sauce (nommmmmmm) and P.S. their garlic sauce is nommmmmm2x",

As Najib promised, their market dip (bean free dip) changes. Today was spinach and sesame. Muhammara was great.  Harissa not as spicy as I've encountered at other places.  Whomever said the flavors just blend together needs to not come to such places because every flavor I chose comes through cleanly. From the citrus mint dressing, the tanginess of the pickles, the lamb, brined kalamta olives, roasted chick peas, etc. Once again, portion is huge! Love it.",

I'm sure someone who eats really small meals can get more meals out of it. You pick your hummus first then your leafy greens. After that, you can pick a meat with roasted veggies if you like. Then they have a whole bunch of toppings. It was my first time & a gentlemen helped me. I think he is the owner. He is very personable & explained to me everything. He was awesome. All this under 10 bucks. I'm on a mission to eat more healthy & this place is definitely fit for that. Thank you Hummus & I will be back again.",

I recommend trying the different sauces, cheeses, spice options.   This place is a tasty and healthy option for those looking for something fresh, low carb or vegetarian.   Drinks were good too, drank the house cucumber mix.   Nice and chill ambiance, with scattered tables.   I will be back. Until then I will cross my fingers that they open one on the west side or even north summerlin.",

So, my husband isn't in to this kind of \"healthy\" stuff, like at all. I drug him here anyway. They have steak, so he was happy.   I ordered a bowl. I will try to remember all of my ingredients! I got the eggplant hummus, romaine and spinach, black lentils, roasted mixed veggies, about 15 toppings, and the herb tahini dressing on the top. My toppings included tomatoes, cucumbers, apple slaw, quinoa, feta cheese, sunflower seeds, and beets. I'm sure there was more!   We also got the pita chips, and got to sample their new peanut butter desert hummus. Yum!  Almost forgot, I got the pineapple cream soda.... tastes like desert :)  I will def be back! Not sure about my husband, but my 3 year not only loved her side of rice, but loved the music and was dancing all over the place. We can do mommy daughter dates!",

I got the spicy hummus, half rice half lentils, half steaks half roasted veggies, and various toppings. I could not finish my bowl. Portion is huge, and it is fulfilling. I was not impressed with the steaks (a bit chewy and was bland), but it went well with everything else. The roasted veggies option (to replace protein) was delicious. That and the halved cherry tomato topping were the highlights.  Good for lunch and dinner. I feel full, but not stuffed or gross out.",

Even with an exceptionally wide variety-- I haven't had a single meal here that has been anything short of amazing!   You have the option between a bowl or a wrap then you kinda just customize it to your liking; choice of meat, veggies, rice, etc.   This place is extremely vegan friendly :-)   The restaurant is incredibly aesthetic-- and most importantly, very clean!   Service is quick and the employees are kind and great at giving suggestions.   10/10 would recommend!",

This is a build your own bowl kinda place which I appreciate the opportunity to choose from multiple veggies and meat options.   I chose the bowl with the classic hummus. Since I am not a picky eater I basically selected pretty much all the options on my bowl. I also chose the lamb and about three very flavorful sauces.  I really enjoyed my meal especially knowing that I was eating something healthy. After finishing I felt satisfied...not overly full. I really liked how well the food felt in my system.   The only thing I was not a fan of was how soggy the bottom of my bowl felt with the hummus. It was a tasty flavor but not the best texture.   If I am ever in the area I would def stop here again. Thank you for your time and service!",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm actually doing this, but I'm giving out a 5 Star Review! I hardly ever do this so y'all better check this place out because it is LEGIT! This is basically a Mediterranean style Chipotle where you can pick various ingredients in either a bowl or pita form. You get to pick things like the hummus flavor, the greens, the grains, the protein, a various assortment of toppings (like tomatoes, cilantro, pomegranate seeds, feta cheese, and etc.), and you finish it off with the sauce.  I ended up ordering a bowl with the spicy hummus which is apparently their most popular flavor and it isn't even spicy hehe along with the beef. Although the appearance leaves a lot to be desired, there is just so much flavor packed into each bite! After the first bite I knew that I just had to write this review because of how good the food is and how I want y'all to check this place out ASAP. The portion is a good deal too! I'm actually surprised I got such a big bowl with a bunch of ingredients for less than $10 and we all know how pricy Mediterranean food can be!    The workers here are super helpful and nice as well. The guy who helped me was very enthusiastic and had a bunch of recommendations since I was a bit overwhelmed and indecisive lol. He even offered to put more ingredients that he thought would complement my choices which meant a lot to me because most places just want to get you in and out.   Overall I would definitely come back here again despite it being a bit far for me. The location is a bit hard to find at first so make sure to have your GPS on. Apparently all their ingredients are fresh and wholesome as well. I really can't think of anything negative because my whole experience was just so positive.",

I was watching the girl make other people's bowl and I was a little grossed out by her plastic gloves that only protect her and not the consumer. On several occasions, she would pull out her dirty germy phone from her dirty back pocket and text while wearing the gloves in between making people's bowl or wrap. Everyone knows how germy cell phones are. Then I would watch grab the different items with her contaminated hands. The type of food here is prone to harmful bacteria if not careful.

The combinations seem almost unlimited. Drink options are interesting with specialty sodas and juices. Everything seemed very fresh and we were told the restaurant makes everything daily.   My bowl definitely tasted fresh and delicious. I went with spicy hummus and loved it mixed with the other flavors in the bowl. The chicken was nicely charred from the grill, but still moist. The garlic sauce was yummy as well as the mint tzatziki. My husband loved his pita and he isn't the type to touch healthy food normally. Both options included more than enough food.

We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  HUMMUS is terrific.  It is a small place, a little tricky to find, that offers excellent flavor varieties of hummus and middle eastern food.  It is set up similar to a Chipotle in that you choose your hummus base, your greens, your rice or black beans, your protein which consists of beef, chicken, lamb, grilled vegetables and other choices, your sauces and enjoy it in a large bowl or wrap configuration.   It is outstanding! Healthy, vegan and gluten free options if you prefer.   The flavors are magnificent, the ingredients fresh, the serving size is ample and a value for the price.  They also have unique soft drink flavors.  This is not your run-of-the-mill middle eastern restaurant.   It is very casual and comfortable.  Old movies play on the wall while you eat which is fun.  Love this place.  Great tastes, fresh and healthy choices, excellent value.  It is worth searching out.  In a sea of restaurants, HUMMUS stands out as an excellent choice that we can heartily commend to you.",

Nothing was left out on \"display\" for too long.  The associates working were very friendly (Feb 7, around 9 PM) and engaged with us.  Location is modern and bright.  Lots of floor to ceiling windows to make it very open and exposed.  You won't find Coca-Cola or Pepsi here.  They use a different company (which I cannot remember the name now), but has a great selection like root beer, cream sodas, fruit-flavors.",

I'm looking forward to eating here there's a place like this in Charlotte called CAVA, I got a bowl the black lentils are not cooked below standard, I ask about the protein and tried the chicken I tell the worker wow that chicken is really dry and not tender she says well it's the end of the night so that's what happens, I looked at her and said chicken is not suppose to be dry the way it was, I asked to try the steak not good at all I'm talking over cooked steak also dry, I finally try the lamb and it's full of salt I said your leaving me with no choice here. I told them you guys really need to re-evaluates how this is cooked and prepped and she just said we do things differently. How can the place in Charlotte North Carolina same food same protein same vegetables be so bad and awful in Las Vegas. Keep in mind that was 40 minutes before closing, I call today and tell them I want my money back I have my receipt is was terrible they said ok come in, so I go in there and was explaining to them how bad the food was and they say we don't get complaints like this so I said here I'll tell you what just instead of refunding my money just make me a new Bowl and That way I give it another chance they we can't do that then changes their mind and says ok what do you want same what I got last time, the girl making it monitors how much the portion was and would take some out and put some back on the spoon and I was come on this is ridiculous, got the chicken got black lentils and veggies and I ask for the sauce and she drench the bowl completely once I opened my bowl up it was so drench in sauce it became a texture of soup!! This place is awful and I would not ever attempt to eat here again shame on you Hummus your food is below average!! If you want to monitor the portions use a scale and stop being so nitty!! I like greens and proteins, protein house, Purple Potato but this place has to go!! Don't waste your money because it's literally a waste of a restaurant in this area and please for the sake of foodies don't fall for the pictures!! Hire a new cook, hire a new staff because one of the worst customer service experiences ever!! I'll let you guys ponder after this..",

Of course I should mention that the staff are friendly and can easily recommend ingredients to those who are new as I was. They also have 3 unique drinks to choose from or standard fountain flavors.

I also LOVE my Air Pods but come on you are serving customers! Wake up call, owners. This does not send a good message to customers.   Got dinner here tonight for the first time and was absolutely blown away! I'm a huge fan of the fast casual build-your-own concepts and this one doesn't disappoint. Flavors were amazing and there was a ride range of toppings to keep it interesting. The concept of the brand and a menu tour were done to perfection by the guy up front.  Some suggestions to make it even better: 1) Find a way to label the toppings. Some were obvious what they were, but most it was hard to tell. I felt guilty asking about each one. I can imagine that it could potentially hold up the line when the restaurant is very busy. 2) Add something SPICY. The Spicy Hummus and Harissa weren't kicking enough for me.  I'll be back TOMORROW!",

I got a bowl with chicken, lentils, hummus, garlic sauce (ask them to go light on it it's very powerful), crispy chickpeas, and arugula. They also carry healthier sodas and non added sugar teas and mock(tails)! This place is far from my house since it is close to Anthem. I loved their coca-cola they had! The other sodas tasted a bit weird.  It's in a very awkward spot so the GPS took me to a different strip mall. The facility is very clean, the staff are very nice and patient as well. I had so many questions and they didn't mind me at all :) overall amazing prices, high quality food, and nice staff. I will be back if I'm in the Henderson/Anthem area!",

The portion size was great too. Everything is fresh and quite healthy so you don't even feel guilty after eating your meal.  Ally (vegan): Love the concept of this place - you choose to order a wrap or a bowl, pick your greens, pick your hummus, your protein and veggie add-ins. I ordered a hummus bowl with spinach, classic hummus, and honestly all the vegan options! So filling and fresh, I think you really get your money's worth.   Good location and nice service! The only odd thing was that there was little seating available, but it seemed like they had the space for more. Otherwise, it's a clean and simple restaurant that we will definitely visit again for its delicious Mediterranean food.",

While I was sitting and eating my food, I over heard who I believe to be the manager, or whoever was in charge not entirely sure, getting upset at their employee, it went as far as the person in charge verbally degrading this employee. I did not see the employee doing anything wrong while working. I will no longer be coming to this establishment because I will not support and give money to a company, that does not respect the work their employees put in nor appreciate that work. I strongly suggest next time you feel the need to reprimand an employee you do so in the office, not in front of your guests. Honestly, if I had not already ordered, I would've just walked back out.",

Naturally I opened up my handy dandy yelp bookmarks to find a new spot to try! Came across hummus! Was amped about going for Mediterranean as I love the spices that Mediterranean food consists of.   This joint is another chipotle for Mediterranean food! You pick your base, your toppings, your meat, your sauce etc! I came for a salad and got hardly any salad. My bowl was thoroughly and unequivocally wet from the hummus they spread around the bowl. Mind you, it wasn't wet from dressing! I got the dressing on the side! I was dying for something healthy, light, and refreshing!   Unfortunately for me, the wetness ruined my entire bowl! Wasn't for me! Maybe the next time, if I return, I'll probably do the hummus on the side???  I didn't even end up finishing my bowl, not even half way before I couldn't do the wetness anymore.   Advice: get the hummus on the side!!   They do play old school films on the projector on the wall though. Super cool touch!",

I came on a Saturday for lunch with some friends. The location is a bit hidden in a strip mall, but the interior is super cute. You have the option between a bowl or pita, choice of hummus, choice of greens, rice, lentils, and tons of delicious toppings and sauces. I personally recommend the garlic sauce and spicy hummus.  For this most recent visit I went with a bowl including spicy hummus, romaine, rice, roasted vegetables, olives, cucumber, tomatoes, and garlic sauce. The portion was huge and it's vegetarian friendly. What's not to love?!  The only sad part about this place is how far away it is from me, ugh!

Order your food at the counter and choose which toppings you like, the braised lamb, grilled vegetables, jalapeno hummus, and muhumarra flavors were out of this world delicious.   They important their tahini directly from Lebanon and it is clear they take serious pride in the quality of their food.  Vegan falafel available.  Vegetarian friendly.   Indoor seating.

As per all the previous reviews, it's pretty standard that you'll get a pretty tasty and filling bowl every time you come here. They offer both bowls and wraps along with other appetizers. It's not a very big menu, but you'll most likely enjoy everything on it! We ordered two bowls with the steak and the Bird's Eye Chili beef (January special) with babaganouch for the base and of course all all the fresh fixin's. The beef is super tender and tasty and my favorite dressings/toppings are the garlic paste, Spicy Harissa, classic tzatziki, and the crispy garbanzo beans. Also decided to try the Halloumi Hash, which was a little skimpy in my opinion in that it came with very little of anything but the cheese. It did, however, have good flavor but came with too little of anything for me to order it again. They also have very healthy and flavorful drink options which are quite refreshing. It's only too bad that they don't have one in the Southwest, otherwise I'd be coming here more often!",

If you like falafel, this place has a really delicious one. Their portions are large and can easily make 2 meals. Their flavored sodas are really yummy and they also have sugar free natrual juice (with free refills). The dinning area is small, but the bowl can easily be made Togo, they have lids at the end of the counter. If you are on a special diet or health conscious, this place is a great option.",

They even added a shredded beef option which reminds me of Mexican Birria, for those that are familiar. Both were great! I've never seen a restaurant listen to their customers and adapt this quickly to make things better and earn their business. This place is a must try! It is both delicious and a healthy choice which is hard to find. I invited my coworker this time  and he loved it. Will definitely be coming back over and over.",

When I first came one of the trays was empty but after I asked if there was any more greens, the employee pointed out owners who were in the back in the process of cutting up more greens. Yes! I liked that, especially it was late evening already, and I was not getting something that's been sitting there all day. They have choice of lentils or herb rice. Love the sauces. My go-to is the \"house fave\" Garlic sauce.  The employee was really helpful and offered to let me try all of them before I decided. Thank you!!   Customize your bowl or wrap. The DIY process is easy as 123. Just read and follow the directions people. You cant go wrong. All the veggies and sauces complement each other.  TIP: the more colorful, the more delicious, not only visually appealing but tastier too.  Love also how they remodeled the space with a more fresh and modern look. The projection screen is pretty cool touch.   Prices are reasonable enough for having your daily lunch fix here.  The space the current restaurant is in has gone over many turnovers through the years, I have a feeling though this place will be here to stay for a while!",

It's worth paying more for the amounts you want.  No complaints on the quality and flavor of the food it's sooooo great!!   Old review: Very good.  I would give 5 stars if They didn't skimp a little on the meat.  It's honestly a joke how little meat was added to my bowl, I could finish it in three bites and I'm not exaggerating. The second time I came back, I ordered extra meat now and pay more just to have a normal serving of meat.  But the quality and flavors are definitely a delight. The staff is friendly.  There's a nice atmosphere.",

On top of all that everything is made in house and fresh, they don't own any freezers!!  I got the bowl filled with spicy hummus and mixed the chicken and veggies. Then added spinach, rice, black lentils that gave a nice texture, pickled onions, tomatoes, cucumber, kalamata olives, Tabbouleh, and topped it off with garlic sauce and another dressing. I like my toppings what can I say. Food was super delicious and pretty filling.   The girl behind the counter was also very helpful giving me some tips and letting me sample the different hummus they had to offer. The owner was a stand up guy too, he talked about how he wanted to share the food he grew up with. And he even added a free drink for me since they had some fresh drinks they make in house too. I got the currant and thyme and omg I'm so glad he gave me that free drink haha.   Overall great service and great food 5/5!! I actually called the store to let them know they're doing a great job and their product is quality. Wishing them luck and I'll be back again soon",

The set up of it reminds me of chipotle set up when you're ordering they have lots of fresh finely chopped veggies, crunchy chickpeas, pomegranate seeds, garlic sauce and so much more!!! I will be returning for more. If they switched their beef to grass fed that would be awesome.  But to end on a good note they are worth the hype!",

I was immediately impressed by how fresh everything was. I ordered a bowl with regular hummus, chicken, rice, lentils, pickled onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, quinoa...and a few other fresh items with garlic sauce. I had no idea how it would turn out or what veggies would taste well with what...but, I was truly amazed!!! Only reason I took one star off because chicken was a little dry.   The resturant was very clean and the staff was friendly. They give you free taste test as well.   I really enjoyed it!!

I am so sad there is only one and that they are so far from my house. I seriously need one of these closer to me. The world should not be deprived of this deliciousness! The recipes for each item are so fresh and so full of flavor!  I went with the roasted veggie hummus bowl with a variety of lettuce and a combo of rice and black lentils. I got to pick several other toppings to go with my bowl. All recipes are his family recipes and are so very yummy!

Very cool and bowl options are like nothing I have ever seen!!  The freshly made (by Najib's sister) fruit drink infusions are BOMB!  Wow, we met everyone tonight, the owner and the chef! I hope and wish that everyone up the hill and down the hill will support HUMMUS. Come try, you will have no regrets if what you crave is fresh, healthy and made with love. Btw, there are no take out menus (in an effort to go paperless) so you will need to come inside. It's behind Bell's BBQ and Pho Mailan. Yay they have also decided to stay open until 10, something we desperately need in the neighborhood! Wonderful food, unique but simple concept--imo the way eating should be. Make HUMMUS your Go-To Bowl spot and you will not be sorry!  Yep ate there last night and going back today. I never do that!",

They had so many healthy options to chose from. The thing I liked the most about HUMMUS is their mix ins and options of sauces. The best part of the meal was their pita chips, it's like nothing I've ever tasted. I always crave the pita chips, it pairs so well with their bowls.

    "text": "Some people talk about a hidden gem. This is really really hidden. This restaurant is located on the backside of the parking lot that it shares with Lee's Liquor and Egg Works. Even knowing its there, it is still easy to just drive by. I guess the silver lining to that location is that there is little problem finding parking. When we walked in, we were greeted by three very friendly staff. Hearing we were first timers, we got an intro mini-speech about the restaurant. The big take home is everything is super fresh - no freezer here. You place your order at the counter \"Chipotle-style\". First decision - bowl or wrap. Then which hummus to go with. I went spicy (yes, it is very spicy for the Gringo palate). Then pick a green, then a protein (chicken, beef, lamb, vegan, cheese or veggie). Then you add in the toppings - way too many to list here. Finally, choose a sauce. I went with the herb tahini. When I go back, I will ask them to go light on the sauce. There are so many wonderful flavors in the bowl, it really doesn't need any sauce so it's a pity to mask them with tahini sauce (which was quite good). Dinner for 2 for about $15. Huge portions, more than I could finish. And delish! We also got to taste their house made chocolate peanut butter hummus. Sorta like healthy Nutella. Too full to buy some tonight but we will back and take some home for a dessert.",

I'm an OG, so the music might be a little loud for me, but the food was really beyond awesome! SO fresh! Not a freezer in the joint (I took a peek in the kitchen and saw them fire grilling some meat too). You get to create your own dish. Hummus, spicy hummus, lamb, beef, chicken, all kinds of veggies and sauces as well. I'm going to have a blast exploring all the different flavor profiles here! I really dig the fountain drinks too. It's some brand I've seen a few times, but no high-fructose corn syrup in the drinks, which is fantastic IMHO. My wife loved Hummus too and she's pretty picky about Mediterranean food. I am too. Spot on. Well done, Hummus!",

Choose either a wrap or bowl, type of hummus (sample to see which you like best), rice or lentils (or 50/50), and add toppings from a wide selection. I added falafel on top of the bowl which I sort of regretted (the falafel was kind of dry)  Atmosphere is a little boring and workers seemed tired when we were there. It was around 8PM and we were the only ones in the shop. There was an old black & white film being projected onto the wall at the time.   It was a nice stop on the way through Vegas to Bryce Canyon.

There is a small pile of hummus, a small pile of tomatoes, a small pile of black lentils and some spinach with some cold steak on top of it. A hard, over fried side of falafel. How is this five star food? This is a solid two star place, maybe three if they can manage to keep the meat warm. I can hardly blame the restaurant for being this bad when the rest of you have given them five stars. I'm giving them one just to help knock them down where they belong. What a joke.

The bowl I whipped together was so good I would come back again.  The disappointing thing was the portion size for the rice and the protein. I am not expecting a heaping portion like they give you at chipotle (since the making a bowl concept is similar).  But I do expect a portion that is larger than a few bites. When my bf got the lamb, he was given MAYBE 3 bites worth. That just seems cheap on HUMMUS's end considering you are already paying 9-something for the lamb bowl (this is before paying for an extra serving of protein). As for the rice, it was sprinkled onto the spinach. Sprinkled.  A good serving size of rice for dinner is a cup and what I got was half that.  The food here is delicious but all that go in should not be afraid of asking for extra with such low portion sizes.",

The selection of dressings was a little intimating so we let our server mix us up something that he liked. It was a perfect blend. We weren't sure what we would find there but followed the Yelp recommendations and weren't disappointed. Loved the beverage selections too. Pita fries are a must! Even ended up adding dessert hummus, which is delicious! Worth the 20 minute drive. They'll be seeing us again.",

All he needed to say it is an additional $4 if you want a little more meat, I would think if I want it or not (I am talking about smaller then a spoon size portion!)",

    "text": "I came here a few weeks ago to try this place out. I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food and Mediterranean flavors and decided to swing by based off of the reviews.  It's a pretty good concept, build your own food through production line, nothing new as far as concept but a little more unique. Coming from Los Angeles I'm no stranger to Mediterranean food set my expectations were set pretty high.  Came in about an hour before closing. There's about four of the people inside enjoying their dinner. Walked up to the construction/food/ordering counter. A girl walked up from the back and stood there just looking at us. We were never technically greeted which made for a very awkward few minutes as we tried to navigate through the menu.  We decided to get a salad and a pita. You basically pick your protein or no protein and can either get some kind of wrap or pita or salad. Selection of toppings is pretty decent. Nothing out of the ordinary. And also choice of hummus style.  First thing I noticed was the consistency of the hummus. Very runny and watery. On the pita that I got it was kind of oozing out of the sides. I went with the beef as the protein. The meat over all looked pretty dry. Portion size was relatively small as well. Decided to take it to go because I didn't want to be that guy that was sitting there while everyone else was trying to clean and go home.  Flavors are OK. Like I said everything is pretty decent. There aren't too many of these places around except for places like parsley Mediterranean. So maybe that's why the reviews are so high. Everything seemed kind of fresh and the place was pretty clean. The girl behind the counter wasn't too helpful and for the price we paid serving sizes were small and there wasn't a True explosion of flavor.  If you're in the neighborhood give it a try, if not you're not missing out on too too much.",

Cozy little area to eat.. must have sat here for about an hour in conversation before realizing that I actually had things to do after lunch.

Regardless, I still make the drive here when I can. I really do love how simple and whole the ingredients are. I usually get a bowl with spicy hummus, add spinach and arugula, chicken (I love their chicken), veggies, add rice, tabouli, cilantro, cucumbers and pickled onions. I also add garlic and Tzatziki sauce on top.   I have enjoyed my experience every time I've visited. It's a decently sized spot. Wouldn't say it's good for big parties. There's also outside seating.

    "text": "There's nothing but good things to say about Hummus!  We've been waiting on this location to open for quite some time and the wait was well worth it!   Food: It's pretty simple! You get to choose a hummus flavor as a base, then select your greens that they have available, do rice or beans or half and half, then choose a protein and load on the topping options! Since we do about 80% plant based eating, we were in the right spot! I chose the plain hummus, kale greens, half beans and half rice, and falafel for my protein. On top I did cucumbers, their quinoa mixture, beets, fennel slaw, tahini sauce, garlic spread and chickpeas! The serving size was huge and the flavors were perfect!   Service: the staff was helpful and friendly. For our first time, they answered all of my questions even if the answers were right in front of me lol.  Atmosphere: Hummus is big enough for a larger party or for a couple of people to enjoy their time together. It's not too big or too small. There's even outdoor seating tables which we loved to let our little one eat (messily) and run amuck afterwards.   Location: Located on the rear of the shopping plaza, Hummus is tucked away in a nice spot. Off of Sunridge and Eastern, I won't complain that it's so close to home!   Overall - We're hooked and are happy to find a super affordable healthy eats joint since we're not huge cooks in our house!",

I was confused for a second when my GPS directed me to the front and decided to circle around to see if it may be on the side or something. Mildly hidden but not that hard as long as you are in the right area  Many have called Hummus a \"Mediterranean Chipotle\". Fairly correct in a sense but I feel like Hummus is more complicated XD more to pick and choose from .   1. Start by picking \"Hum Bowl\" or \"Pita Wrap\".  2. Pick your hummus: Choice of classic, spicy, market (bean free), or BabaG (Baba ghanoush - eggplant) 3. Choose Greens: Romaine, Baby Chard, Baby Spinach, Baby Kale, or I had the choice of arugula too !  4: Add Grains: Herbed rice or black lentils  5: Pick the Protein: Flame Grilled Chicken, Flame Grilled Beef, Braised Lamb, Vegan Falafel, Crispy Halloumi Cheese, Seasonal Roasted Veggies 6. Choose Toppings: Topping variety was wide (I don't remember them all). Choices include pickled onions, a seasoned and plain quinoa, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, ..... yeah I don't remember that many.. there were some sort of pickles, some mixed salad thing with lemon juice, etc 7. Pick your sauce: Garlic Sauce, Mint Tzatziki, Herb Tahini, Muhammara, Hot Chili harissa, House Dressing  I had picked a hummus bowl w/ spicy hummus. They spread the hummus around the bowl so you get some during every bite?? Lol A mix of baby spinach and arugula was really good, topped with herbed rice. Friend's had all preferred chicken but I do plan on trying the beef and lamb at some point as well. I picked a good amount of toppings including pickled onions, feta cheese, seasoned quinoa, cherry tomatoes, salad thing w/ lemon juice... I was hoping to get some spice from the hot chili harissa but it wasn't as spicy as I hoped. Or remotely spicy (for my anyway). Harissa is a type of African chili paste that's fairly known to be quite spicy but their version is really mild. Mixed with garlic sauce and tzatziki was a good way to go.   After I got home, I mixed everything together before I ate it, or at least to the best of my ability.... maybe I should take have more of a chipotle mindset and just shake it in the bowl. Lol Overall, its like eating a chipotle bowl but it was mildly more difficult because of the greens. Flavor wise, there were a lot of bright flavors (from the pickled onions to the lemon juice salad thing...) cutting through the creaminess of the sauces and what not xD Chicken was pretty similar to chipotle actually. Cube bite size dark meat chicken. The harissa and garlic sauce is fairly thick but tzatziki was much thinner. Good amount of food for the price. All this for $8.55. Almost seems cheaper and theoretically healthier than Chipotle.",

What I love about this place is the many choices, varieties, and ability to change it up every time you come here. I like to line my bowl with Baba ganoush and then I ask for all the varieties of greens. Their chicken is incredibly moist or you can choose grilled vegetables, beef, or lamb.   There are so many different toppings to choose from, and even sauces that for  me it would be impossible to exhaust all the possible combinations.   If you have dietary restrictions it is very easy to customize your meal here. Healthy yummy food.  I can't wait to go back.

I don't think the Yelp category is correct, but it worked out anyway.  There are four tables with benches outside.  This is a shared office space so do not expect service or an open table.  This is the only way the restaurant is dog friendly.  Just get your food and sit outside.    There was a fast and efficient serving process. Everything was clean and contained well. Nice, high splash guards.  The meat and toppings choices were vast. Many times at a salad bar type of place the toppings are lacking.  Everything was fresh and tasty. The jalapeno topping was perfect.  The only thing that didn't work with my bowl was the feta.  I ordered the braised beef and it was nicely seasoned with an appropriate portion size.  If I'm that way again I'll stop in. The bowl was delish!",

You start with your hummus, greens, then meats and toppings. Finally they have some awesome sauces to choose from. I mean, what's great about here is the bowl is like under $10 and you get A TON of food. They offer wraps here too which is basically your bowl in a wrap which I think is cool.   Anyways, fun/cute/unique places are a must on this side of town especially because they're building all these new malls and stores along St. Rose and businesses like this should definitely get some exposure early on.   Four stars just because the service is whatever. It's a bunch of teenage kids who are just trying to make a little extra cash. Nothing amazing.",

    "text": "What an amazing place! This isn't your average bowl mixology joint, every single ingredient they carry is fresh and almost all of it is made in-house, down to the healthy drinks. In fact, it's pretty hard to find anything here that is unhealthy! This was my FIRST VISIT and I loved the decor walking in, plus you are greeted immediately! The setup is nice and the service was fantastic, very accommodating and informative.   I was able to sample a few things before selecting and thank goodness because the bean-free hummus that I was curious about was OUTTA SIGHT! You do have to like garlic, and many of the selections are garlicky, but still yummy as ever. With the create-your-own-bowl concept, like any other place, you begin with a base, add a protein, and then go crazy with the toppings. What I liked about this joint is that they focus on spread (hummus, baba ghanoush, etc) as the base rather than greens or rice. One of the bowl selections available is a green or grain, but they are more of an accent instead of a \"bowl filler.\"    I HIGHLY recommend the bean-free hummus; it's a spinach and artichoke concept with tahini but it's the tastiest spread they have. I also fell in love with their halloumi, both it and the falafel are cooked to order and these are the little things that set this place apart. The falafel is good, albeit a bit heavy on the spice side, tasted like a little too much cumin or ground coriander, but still great and fluffy inside.   At HUMMUS, they also make almost all of the topping ingredients in-house, even the pickled onions! The apple and fennel slaw was one of my favorites in the toppings area. You can pretty much go crazy with toppings and all of it is good! They can also top it all off with a sauce (like spicy or traditional garlic sauce) and their house-made spicy seasoning or a crunchy addition like fried chickpeas or sunflower seeds!  In the end, the \"bowlology\" experience at HUMMUS  was like no other and I can't wait for my next visit!!",

We asked if they were affiliated, but they are not.  You can choose either a wrap or bowl. Pick your base of salad or grains and then top with delicious meats or vegetables and a huge array of toppings... from pickled onions, beets, quinoa, seasoned tomatoes, feta and so much more... Made every bite of my bowl Delicious!!!! Good news is that you don't feel guilty, because it is all lean choices.  They have natural flavor sodas and flavored waters. I prefer a black tea. This is a great place for lunch, especially if you're getting your car clean at 7 Hills Car Wash.",

Drove by and saw it so I stopped in. They weren't officially open, but I could have ordered food and would have had the girl changed her gloves. She was cleaning when I got in there. So gross. Same thing last night. Change your nasty gloves! The lettuce was on the wilty/brown side and the falafel was  like old, hard rocks. Probably the worst falafel I have ever had. It was so dry and burnt that I had to bury it in my salad.  The bowl is huge and they don't charge extra for all the toppings you add. Maybe lunch time is a better time to go.",

If you get the right mix of everything you can positively enjoy yourself. The only thing about this is the location. Because it's in the back of a strip mall it won't receive much foot traffic, but I hope it does well and continues to succeed.  They don't freeze any of their products and everything is fresh. We need more healthy alternatives like this. I didn't even get to there soda fountain= they have black cherry tarragon soda !! So delicious, and the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about their products. You can tell they believe in what they sell and it helps to sell more",

Everything was fresh the staff was helpful and it was a great family friendly atmosphere. I can see a bigger space in their future as the seating was a little tight.

I am HUMM ing with joy and delight.   I have to thank dear Yelp Elite Florence M from Springfield NJ for her absolutely spot on review and photos from July that got me so pumped about amazing options in Henderson, about  15 minutes south of the Strip.   I was fortunate to meet Najib, the owner and one of the nicest people I have met. Lot of love and great energy that transmits right to his employees and the lovely food being served. I saw it in his eyes!! Really good guy!! By the way his dear Mom is also in the kitchen and the Garlic Sauce is her very own special recipe. Love It!!   Walked in to a beautiful hello from Jessica and Earnen.( pardon if I got the spelling wrong). Jessica was so sweet and took this enthusiastic first timer through all of the options - wrap vs Bowl, classic or zucchini or spicy Hummus, choice of 5 greens, herbed rice/lentils or both( yes both), protein be it Chicken, beef, lamb, Falafel, seasonal roasted veggies. Then the sauces - Garlic Sauce, Mint Tzaziki, Herb Tahini ( I got all 3 of these and three servings of the garlic sauce but of course), Muhammara, hot chili Harissa or house dressing( citrus mint).   Everything just came together like a beautiful Mediterranean Vegas symphony. It was so good they should call this the \" SIN BOWL\" as in sinfully spectacular and gorgeous. I have had bowls in Boynton Beach, Fl and Gramercy Park in NYC and Hummus does take the Championship Bowl in all categories.   I really loved Najib and the two ladies who work for him. Really made my trip!   I am doing three lunches and dinners for my medical groups in Nevada and am going to have Najib cater and bring this love to them as well. Win, win, win!!  The restaurant is hopping with about 15 customers at 1:00 pm local time. Love it!! 413 Yelpers also concur with a unanimous 5 STAR reviews across the board.  To my friends and family in Cali and Az who come to Vegas often. This is a sure bet, a winner! I 15 to the 215, get off on Eastern and head south and west for a few minutes. The best Bowls and wraps are just over 2 miles down on your right in the back of a shopping plaza by a salon and car wash.   Can't wait to be back! Love \" Hummus\". That's a Wrap ;)",

Unfortunately today as I was eating my bowl I bit into a big chunk of chicken (I'm guessing it was mixed in with the veggies).   I spoke with the manager, who stated nonchalantly that, \"it happens sometimes\". He didn't offer a refund; I had to ask.   I understand that most people reading this aren't vegan, but this establishment's careless attitude could easily impact those with food allergies (or just plain dislike of certain items) as well. The managers response was reand I will not be returning.   UPDATE: thank you to the owner for his prompt and thoughtful response. I have not been back to HUMMUS yet, but I definitely plan to. In the meantime, I am updating my review to reflect his dedication to correcting the problem.",

    "text": "What a yummy hummus place! I have been wanting to check this place out for awhile. These Hummus bowls are a good option especially for those looking for a more healthy option.   There are a few types of Hummus you can choose from, I chose the spicy and it was pretty good. I will admit that the hummus on its own is just okay. I will not go over where I have tried hummus in the world but I will say that the hummus here is okay. With enough ingredients put on top, the hummus tastes better!  With that said, the build your own hummus bowl is a cool concept. The ingredients are healthy like different greens (kale, arugula, spinach, etc), lentils, chicken, lamb, beef, etc. If you are looking for a non-meat option, the Crispy Halloumi Cheese is delicious. There are other toppings and sauces that you can have added to really create a personalized bowl. If you were to get any sauce or topping, the Garlic Sauce and the Crispy Chickpeas are pretty yummy!  This little hidden gem in Henderson is worth a try especially when it comes to the customization of your own bowl or wrap. I like this place  and would definitely come back if I am on this side of town.     since you can build your own with the healthy ingredient options.",

I was floored by all the choices and eagerly texted him everything I wanted in my hummus bowl. He came home and I could not believe how big the bowls were! Definitely worth the money and the drive out there.  The spicy hummus and the eggplant hummus were both great but I definitely like the eggplant hummus more. All the vegetables were super fresh and they give a good amount of dressing. The toppings I highly recommend are the seasoned tomatoes, pomegranate seeds, crispy chickpeas, and the garlic sauce. Their herbed rice was also great. I got the falafel and it was absolutely delicious, my husband didn't care for it but he loves meat so I wasn't expecting the best reaction from him lol.  This will definitely be one of our go to places now.",

With unlimited toppings, the bowl's in your court. :)  Here you go left to right like Qdoba and Chipotle and pick a base of 3 different hummuses or a smokey babaganoush, one of 5 greens, herbed rice or black lentils (really good!), one of 6 proteins like chicken, beef, braised lamb (so juicy and shredded so it's so easy to eat), falafel, crispy halloumi cheese, or roasted veggies, unlimited toppings (of 21 choices and I recommend them all), and one of 6 sauces. I chose the fresh-tasting Muhammara sauce of roasted peppers and walnuts and loved it! Bowls range from $7.90 to $9.70 depending on the protein. I mixed all the ingredients together and it was lip-smacking good!  For sides, the Crispy Halloumi Cheese Hash really satisfied with slightly salty and squeaky goodness dressed with pomegranate seeds and molasses, tzatziki, pepper flakes, and mint. Get it!  While I wish there was a little more flavor to their Cucumber Blossom drink, everything else completely bowled me over. I super recommend this place!  TIPS: **Plenty of parking in a shared lot. **Wheelchair accessible. **Gender-neutral restroom.",

Service is good, all of the workers are all very helpful especially if it's your first time.  The menu and selections can be overwhelming at first, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

    "text": "The concept is great. If you've ever been to a Cava (Mediterranean fast-casual chain all over the US), this is pretty much the same thing on a slightly smaller scale.  Portions are large, plenty of veggie and meat options for everyone, and relatively healthy depending on how you customize your bowl/wrap. Hummus is the Chipotle of Mediterranean - nothing fancy, but solid nonetheless.   I've been here multiple times and the only reason I'd give it 3 stars as opposed to 4 or 5 is because it's incredibly inconsistent. Every time you go in, your bowl or wrap really depends on the employee they have behind the counter (most are high school/college kids). Some are more experienced and others are definitely not. At times I've gotten a great bowl/wrap and on the flip side, have gotten some pretty bad ones. On one occasion, they were trying to make my order so quickly that they accidentally scooped in a giant glob of garlic sauce and pickles (I didn't ask for either of these ingredients).   Overall, great concept and solid food, but they should do a better job in terms of consistency. You'll get a different bowl each time, depending on who's working the counter.",

My son and I were blown away with the excellent quality of every ingredient, every bite of our meals, and every sip of our drinks. As soon as we were told the owners are Lebanese then it clicked for us both -\"no wonder!\" As many of us lovers of Mediterranean food know - Lebanese are the best cooks. Would've given 5 stars if I didn't notice the dirty iPad screen used for payment - could feel it while my finger wrote my signature. Also, the drink area wasn't clean - the area that catches the spills needed to be emptied/drained. Minor issues although the iPad screen was the worse of the two issues for me.",

I got the tzatziki and garlic sauce and he got the harissa sauce. There are so many different options to try that you could get something completely different the next time you go. I love places that let you customize your meal.",

The spring mix salad looked terrible, and if they can't rotate that out, it made me question the freshness and safety of the other foods,especially the meats. I'm still giving three stars, because on the first visit the food was delicious, and my husband enjoyed his wrap today. Although, the person making the wrap just piled the toppings on rather than distribute throughout.   I will probably give this place another chance, hopefully today was just a fluke. I would love to up my review to 4-5 stars because I really did enjoy the flavor on the first visit.",

The way I would describe this place is it's sort of a Mediterranean twist on a chipotle or make your own pizza place. You are greater as soon as you walk through the door and the atmosphere is very modern yet comfortable. You start off choosing between a bowl or a wrap and from there the possibilities are endless. They have 4 types of hummus, I'd recommend the spicy one, lots of meat, veggie, and even a fried cheese option. All the food is fresh and the owner even showed me that they don't even have a freezer on the premises. All the food I have tried is amazing and I will definitely be coming back a lot. I would recommend this restaurant to any person looking for fresh, healthy, Mediterranean food that gives you many options to make it your own.",

    "text": "Middle eastern restaurants are easy to find on Eastern Avenue,  I can think of at least 7 off the top of my head.  Most are good to excellent.  HUMMUS is spectacular!!!   I was there in their first week which typically is difficult for restaurants.  I should know as I have been involved with the startup of several restaurants that eventually became national chains. Yet, HUMMUS hit the ground running fast and is still running at top speed.  I keep on coming back because they get an A+  for quality of the food, decor, prices (value), and good service.  They get a B+ on location as it can be hard to find as it is located behind some other restaurants.    Let me try to describe how good the food is as well as the concept. Some other reviewer described HUMMUS as being similar to Chipolte. That is a good description but I truly feel the quality of the food is better at Hummus.  You first choose your flavor of hummus or babaghanoush  (egg plant) for your bowl or wrap. Then came the fresh greens including your choice of romaine, baby spinach, kale or baby chard. Next came either herbed rice or black lentils.  I usually ask for a little of both. This is followed by a generous scoop of  either steak/chicken/lamb or vegetarian options.  I have never tried anything but the chicken because it is that good.  Top off this bowl or wrap with various toppings and then pick your sauce including the house favorite garlic sauce. My own personal favorite is their own house dressing called citrus mint.  Writing this review is making me hungry!!!    The decor of HUMMUS is pleasant with a healthy feel.  Speaking of healthy, the ingredients all seemed to be fresh. Even though I am a meat eater, vegetarians and vegans will be pleased by the choices they may find at HUMMUS.  I also really like that they did not go the way of having either a Pepsi or Coke soda fountain.  The soft drinks were very different and quite tasty.  HUMMUS also makes some home made drinks such as cucumber mint..  BTW, the paper bowls they use are recyclable. I believe this is one example of how the owner also wants a healthy world.  My only complaint on the decor is that the restaurant sometimes runs out of seating during busy times because people just want to hang out there. It is a nice problem for a restaurant to have.    The prices are a very good value for what you get.  The grilled chicken bowl I usually get is only $7.90.  The beef and lamb are only slightly more.  Drinks are reasonably priced at about $2.50.  A side of pita fries is also $2.50 with a side of falafel being about $4.    Good customer service is important to any restaurant.  The people behind the counter are friendly yet quick.  If you don't know what to try, they can suggest bowls or wraps that others have loved,  The owner seems to be there most of the time and just may drop by your table to see what you think.  He is always trying to improve but seriously folks, there is not much to improve on.   The location of HUMMUS is somewhat difficult to find but this will help.  Ii's in the northwest corner of the intersection of Sun Ridge Heights and Eastern.  It is behind a couple of buildings (like Lee's Liquor) and I believe it has a green sign.    In conclusion, if you like really good fresh food at a reasonable price and at a place where they truly value their customers, HUMMUS is a place you must try.    #hummusbowls #gethumbowled",

Some very familiar things are on the menu, but are recreated in a very innovative and creative way. I am the type that loves to mix as many random things as possible so this place was great for me. I was kind of afraid that I ruined my wrap because I put a lot on them, but somehow, everything complimented each other and no combination of things turned out to be out of place. The flavors all worked! All of the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful, and you can tell that the meat is high-quality because the beef wasn't chewy and didn't have any random tendons or fat on it.   I'd suggest just going with whatever sounds good to you, there isn't a right or wrong formula here, just order!   The pita fries were also amazing. They had the texture of a crispy fry, but were obviously pita. It was the best thing to use to try their dips.   One of the best things I've ever eaten was the haloumi hash. It was essentially fried cheese with an amazing sauce, and fresh pomegranate seeds. I definitely ordered way too much food since the wraps are massive, but I would definitely order this again.   Lastly, as someone who doesn't like fruit juice, I really enjoyed the cucumber, lemon, orange blossom drink (can't remember its exact name).  I typically don't ever drink fruit juice, but I especially hate juice when I'm thirsty or eating because I find that they only make me more thirsty. The drinks here aren't crazy sweet, and don't have a synthetic taste to them, so they're definitely great to have while eating.   I come to Vegas for the strip, but I'll be stopping by here every time I come to Vegas!",

    "text": "This place is great for a quick, healthy meal that will leave you more than satisfied. A great change from the standard Chipotle. The spicy hummus here is one of my favorites, and the topping choices are abundant. I have been coming here for about a year and noticed that they raised their prices, but I don't mind too much because the quality and freshness of the food here is well worth the price. I usually get a chicken bowl and load up on the toppings. My favorites include beets, pomegranate seeds, tomatoes, and roasted chickpeas. The garlic sauce is by far my favorite dressing. I usually get two generous meals out of one bowl. My only complaint is that adding veggies is an additional charge now, but I will definitely be back when I want a healthy meal that is full of flavor.",

    "text": "I can't praise this place enough. I describe it as a Mediterranean chipotle. If you're thinking \"well, I don't really like hummus that much\".... just don't put it in your bowl! The lineup includes a base of your choice of hummus (reg, spicy, baba gan, market), choice of greens (arugula, chard, spinach, baby kale, I think romaine as well), rice and/or black lentils, a protein source (chicken, steak, falafel, veggies) and then whatever else your heart desires. They have over a dozen topping options and nothing costs extra. Lots of sauce options too. Depending on which protein choice you get you will spend $7-10. You can also make a wrap instead of a bowl but if you get as much as I do, you will want a bowl to fit it all in!",

I've been here a couple of times and heard the spiel both times... they don't even own a freezer, everything's made fresh, yada yada. I love that concept but hated that i damn near lost a tooth unexpectedly biting into a massive bone in my chicken. The last time I was in I didn't like that the guy at the counter stopped preparing my meal to tell newcomers about the restaurant. I was held up while they asked questions and, being in with my fussy toddler, i couldn't appreciate the delay. A simple, I'll be right with you after I finish up here\" could have went a long way right then. Friendly service but could afford to learn to prioritize customers in a fairer way.   The hummus and baba ganoush are excellent. I had really liked the chicken but, after the bone incident, I think I'm kind of scarred. Roasted veggies are delish but I think they are an extra charge to an already somewhat pricey meal. And finally, my bowl just wasn't that filling for dinner, and I loaded up on toppings so something was amiss. Maybe more protein and less lettuce? I don't know.  I don't want to write this place off just yet but I'm not fully buying in right now. Improvements are needed.",

Everything is fresh (no freezer), truly authentic, non-GMO, organic, etc.  We both got massive wraps (like massive), as well as pita fries and drinks on the house. So thankful for an owner that literally let us try everything, every sauce and hummus, and gave us the opportunity to try the other unique stuff on the menu!! The pita fries were so good dipped into the tzaztiki and the harissa sauces. Kinda like the crunchy fries at the bottom of the bag taste. And we got to try all of their fresh juices (there was a cucumber melon, watermelon \"mock\"jito, currant, etc) and they also had organic sodas to choose from. They had a bitchin selection of sauces and hummus. The spinach and artichoke hummus, chili harissa sauce, tahini, and the tzatziki were our favorites. Listen to what the owner says when he recommends something - he knows his stuff.  I thought that I was very well-versed in authentic med. food until we came here. :) Shoutout to the owner for letting us try everything and not making fun of us when we butchered all the pronunciation of the food. PS Very vegan friendly!!!!!",

So many good places that offer a semi-full to full vegan menu and Hummus was one of them. They are located in the back part of the parking lot(behind Bells BBQ) and there is parking in front of or on the side. Not many spots available when i went but got lucky when someone close backed out. This is a build your own bowl or wrap style place where you walk down picking and choosing what you want. They do have meat options for the carnivores in case you were wandering. I chose a hummus bowl with lentils, roasted veggies(my protein selection) and added a little bit of everything as the scoops are small, yet perfect for each bowl.

I informed the employee that it was my first time there when I ordered a bowl in the hopes that he would explain to me what everything was or to even tell me what the steps are for ordering a bowl. He just stared at me with out saying a word and I had to guess on what I was supposed to do. After I left I told my friend who told me about this place my experience and she said \"yup everyone complains about that\". So at least I wasn't alone.",

All the ingredients tasted fresh and I loved the spicy kick of the hummus and sauce. They also have healthy alternatives to soda which is awesome. A bowl and drink for $13, so worth it.

Our kids tried our food and wished they would have trusted me and ate here. My 7 year said it was the best food ever.   I had a grilled chicken bowl with spicy hummus. It was a mild spice to it. Then topped with tons of veggies. Loved the beets and pickled onions. Such a beautiful colorful bowl. You could pick and choose what toppings you wanted.   My husband had the pita with spicy beef. Loved it too. Love the tropical slaw and quinoa mixture.   We all loved the falafel. My kids were hesitant to try it but again they loved it.   Nice atmosphere and bit out of the way for us but worth the drive.",

The ingredients were very clearly fresh and I appreciated having so many options to personalize my meal. Also there was no shortage of flavor in my bowl. So why the 3 stars you may ask? Well.. the proteins were a bit on the cold side, for both my friend and myself and we both got different meats also there wasn't much of it. In a large bowl the amount of meat I got was very disappointing. Also, my bowl was a bit watery. This could have been my fault though as I got two sauces instead of one but tzatziki is not usually that watery in my experience, but the bottom of the bowl was just a soggy mess.   However, LOVED the drink options. I got the Basil Lemonade and my friend got the watermelon mockjito. Both super delicious and they had a Stubborn soda fountain which is always great.   Would I come back? Eh... still on the fence about that one.",

For my protein, I had lamb. Let me tell you, that lamb was gooooood! The texture and flavor was on point for me. And every other topping just topped off the flavor of the food. The picture doesn't do it justice.  They also have mixed fruit drinks. For me, it wasn't sweet as I'd like it to be, so I asked for sugar on the side. I'm not deducting points for that just because I'm sure some like it with less sugar. My wife enjoyed the watermelon drink!   Their location is a drive if you're on the strip but I think it's worth it! Staff and service are good too! I hope you enjoy what they serve!",

I always get the classic hummus--can't go wrong with that! It is so creamy, one of the best I have ever had. Other options are spicy, market (no beans), and eggplant.  The next steps are: pick your greens, pick protein (which include vegan options), pick toppings, and pick sauce.  I love my bowls with the beef just as much as the roasted vegetables.  Both seasoned well!  I will have to try the falafel, crispy cheese, and the chicken next.  There are toppings galore! While there are so many to choose from, the ones I really like to add are cucumber, tomato, fennel apple slaw, cilantro, crispy chickpeas (added so much texture to my bowl!).  There are other toppings like olives, feta, and different pickled veggies.  I really like there garlic sauce and tzatziki!  The location is definitely a hidden gem in the Anthem area and well worth trying!",

You can easily enjoy a plant-based meal (vegetarian and vegan options are plentiful) or add some protein if you prefer. As others have mentioned, you order at the counter and select your base (be it a bowl, wrap, or salad) and go down the line and pick your toppings. Their variety of hummus is all made from scratch and is packed with freshness and flavor. The atmosphere is cute, bright, and casual.    I've always ordered to go bowls for a quick lunch, and have licked the bowl clean each time. I wish they had more locations (especially up in the NW/Centennial area).

From when we first walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the decor, and everything felt super clean. It's a chipotle style kinda restaurant where you pick and choose what you want. I ordered the falafel sandwich and my vegan wife got the falafel bowl. They don't cook the falafels till after you place your order which preserves the freshness. The spinach and artichoke hummus is amazing and it's a must to try. Overall the food was fresh and tastes very authentic. Najib the owner is very friendly and passionate about his restaurant. He even threw in some free delicious pita fries with our meals. We will definitely be back.",

This menu is like a journey for your mouth, as you build your own custom wrap or bowl.  Black lentils, savory chicken, falafel, tabouli, tzatziki, all of the flavors combine into a gorgeous creation that feels both trendy and classic.    The assembly line staff were efficient and friendly to even the most novice customers, helping them along their journey.  If you are into food, and you prefer your food to be fresh and lovingly prepared, HUMMUS is your next spot. Trust me!",

If done right, you can have yourself a delicious bowl for what I think is a fair price.

Then, greens - I opted for spinach. Afterwards, lentils or rice - I did half & half! Then, you pick what kind of meat - I got their falafel! Their falafels are made to order so it's really fresh. After, you get to pick your toppings & you can put however much you want on there, no extra charge! I had to wait a little for my falafels but let me tell you... the wait is totally worth it!!

    "text": "This place is a modern take on Mediterranean. I like how they are conscious of certain dietary needs--vegan, gluten-free, paleo, etc. with so many veggie options. I feel like eating health on the go can be tricky when you really wanna get your full servings of greens! This place is heaven for that reason. The only criticism I have is the bowl was too rich, I could not finish it. Too many combinations of sauces (I got the garlic house and tahini), just one is really necessary. Also I'll probably skip the feta next time, for I think that was part of the reason it was too rich. Great ambiance, great music selection, will definitely be my go to on this side of town!",

A Chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap. Lots of great options! I went with the bowl today and I loved it! Delicious and the healthiest thing I've had in days, just a real feel good meal. I thought having hummus on the bottom would be weird, but I worked great. The lamb was wonderful and I love the whole scoop of feta. Will definitely be back especially since it's so close to my place in Anthem.",

    "text": "Ordered 2 wraps so we could try as much as possible for our first visit to hummus. I found this place after searching for food near our house and it has such a good concept and amazing reviews I put it on the short list of places to visit ASAP!   Firstly the people working the counter are very sweet and engaging. Both said hello as I walked in the door and after stating it was my first time the guy helping me explained how all the food is non gmo and went through the ordering process.   I got 2 wraps one with spicy hummus, spinach, chicken, and a ton of other goodies. The other was regular hummus, their shredded beef, romaine lettuce, and loaded with all kinds of goodies as well.   The chicken was dry. In the 6 minutes it took for me to drive home it had wilted the spinach and made this soggy goop mixed with the hummus at the bottom of the wrap. The garlic sauce that is so highly recommended by nearly every yelper was put on the side and I spooned literally a teaspoon of it on the entire wrap and completely overpowered every single flavor inside. But the worst part, the WORST was that the crappy clearly frozen and reheated pita was broken and cracked in 5 pieces making it impossible to eat. Had 3 bites of it before we decided to trash it and move on.   The beef was flavorful and juicy, and luckily I had waited to put the garlic sauce on before finishing the first wrap so we just threw it away. The problem with this wrap was it was just a total mess. The beef was sooo juicy that it just soaked through the paper and became a log of soggy goo. Somehow even though there was so much juice the crappy dry pita wrap was again broken and fell apart making taking a bite nearly impossible since the paper wrap holding it together was also soaked through. Ate almost half before we gave up and discarded it.   The fountain cream soda was delicious and I loved the crushed ice. The total for the 2 wraps and a drink was just over 20$ which is not much at all, but gets considerably more expensive when you throw 3/4 of it in the trash and have to go out and find other food options because we are still hungry.   I wanted to love hummus. I told friends about how much I wanted to try this place. I LOVE Mediterranean food, but this was 100% not good. I hope our experience was an isolated one, but knowing that their pita comes shipped in a plastic bag and given the flavors we encountered I was truly unimpressed. Maybe we should have ordered a bowl, but that's not what we wanted. I don't want to hate on the lovers of this place, but I want to assure you it is not as amazing as the reviews suggest. If you don't believe me try it for yourself. Make sure you smile and tip before you storm out of there looking for a different restaurant that is actually delicious and satisfying!",

Other than another couple who were finishing their meal, we were the only ones in the restaurant other than 2 employees.  Our choices were limited because several items, notably the salad greens had not been replenished even though the restaurant was not schedule to close for almost 2 hours.  There were only a few pieces of Romaine in the tray and the spinach was wet and looked unappetizing. Each of the available meat choices appeared to be dried out from sitting too long so my wife decided to go with the roasted vegetables adding classic hummus as a base plus black lentils, arugula, tomatoes and sunflower seeds with a citrus mint dressing.  My bowl was filled with arugula, tasteless herbed rice, flamed (dried out) chicken, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, pomegranate seeds and feta with the same dressing.  We found the quantity of rice/black beans to be excessive in relation to the remaining ingredients so the overall flavor profile came up short.",

The pics and reviews were a selling point for me to show my hubby who is not too keen on trying new things. But I told him we can try it and maybe he might like it. So he picked me up from work and took me on a lunch date. The restaurant was clean and bright despite the rain. We were greeted when we walked in and were asked if this was our first visit. The ladies behind the counter were very friendly explaining how we could have a bowl or a pita. Plus they let us try their choices of hummus. All were yummy. I chose the spinach artichoke and hubby chose half original and jalapeno. My husband decided on a bowl and I went the pita route. The whole time we were building our meals the staff was patient and answered any questions we had. Which was nice because sometimes trying something new can be overwhelming. We sat down to eat and the atmosphere was calm and relaxing. I enjoyed my pita and look forward to coming back to try a bowl. And the best part is my hubby said he would like to go again as well. Thank you for a new lunch date spot. See you soon. Keep up the great work!!!",

No Coke/Pepsi to drink - not a big deal for us, but you might care. There are some other natural sodas and flavored waters (free refills). The mixed vegetables were seasoned really well, and everything tasted fresh. The pita fries were a family favorite, and we recommend the pita fries for every family, even picky eaters. Maybe kids won't love Hummus, but ours did. If they don't there's a Wendys somewhere around there.  The ONLY con that I can speak of (hence the 3 stars) is that we cam in and interrupted the two female workers while they were working on their personal computer at the counter. They looked probably college age (maybe homework), so that's what we assumed. We definitely interrupted them, and actually wondered if we should feel bad for having come in!   We shrugged this incident off, not allowing it to ruin our experience. Instead we enjoyed the b&w video playing on the wall (very cool). THe place is clean and well lit, and the price is NOT BAD AT ALL considering how much food is actually in your bowl. We will be back when we're back on that side of town again looking for food.",

I am so happy I came across this place on Yelp when arriving to Vegas and looking for dinner. The prices are incredible for the amount of toppings you can get. I chose the chicken bowl and wow the chicken was so flavorful and it paired well with the spicy hummus.   There was a young man who helped my friend and I and he described everything so well and really helped with pairings. I was hesitant that all my toppings would go well together, but they all really did and there is no maximum on how many toppings you can load into your bowl.   This place was SOOO good, I was really sad I didn't have a chance to go back before leaving Vegas. I am definitely looking forward to going back to Vegas and having so more HUMMUS!",

My pita wrap was just as filling as my sister's bowl, can't go wrong with either option.  My sister and I both agree that we much prefer the overall taste of the food here compared to other similar type restaurants we've been to in The Valley.   Portion sizes are a great value and most importantly the variety of available toppings is amazing.  Loved the seasoned cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, tabouli - think those will be my staples when I return.  Can't wait to go back and try the other \"hummus\" offerings of babaganoush and/or the bean free option.  If it's anything like the classic and spicy I know I won't be disappointed.   I just wish this was closer to where I lived in the SW.",

And after that I waited, and waited for it to open!  So yesssssss, this is some amazing food.  It's different, it's fresh, it's all made in house.  There are no freezers in the back.  They explain the ingredients, that you might not know what it is.  Hunny 'cha  don't even ask me all that I put in my bowl, because, I had to ask quite a few questions about what this was or what that was.  And my bowl came out amazing!  I hope I can recreate it when I go back.  So you can do it in a bowl or on pita bread.  If you like hummus, you really should check it out.  Heck, even if you don't like hummus, you don't have to have the hummus on your bowl or pita.  But it's worth checking out if you want something fresh with organic ingredients.  This is also a good place for Vegan's and vegetarians.",

    "text": "The rave reviews so far are no joke. I was very happy after trying this newest take on the Chipotle-inspired business model.  HUMMUS Bowls & Wraps is a simply and appropriately named casual restaurant on the back side of a building with more visible tenants such as Pho MaiLan and Bell's BBQ. They do customizable bowls and \"wraps\" (more on this later) with a Mediterranean / Middle Eastern flair, and there's plentiful seating with a rather bright/white aesthetic and what vaguely sounds like culturally appropriate music.  The owner wasn't on premises, but a very knowledgeable employee greeted me and walked me figuratively through the menu and literally down the assembly line after mentioning that almost everything is made in-house. The steps are as follows:  1) Decide whether you want a bowl or wrap.  2) Hummus! There's classic hummus, spicy hummus, bean-free \"market\" hummus (spinach/artichoke blend), and baba ganoush (eggplant). Classic hummus and baba ganoush were both delicious.  3) Greens. Choices are romaine, chard, spinach, and kale. Romaine is boring, and the crunch is redundant if you get the right toppings down the line, so I don't foresee myself ever choosing it.  4) Herbed rice or black lentils. Both are viable, but the lentils were pretty darn good.  5) Protein, the sole determinant of price. Choices are flame grilled chicken ($7.90), flame grilled beef ($8.82), braised lamb ($9.70), falafel ($7.90), crispy halloumi cheese ($7.90), and seasonal roasted veggies ($6.95). More notes on what I chose later, but cheese wasn't on display, beef looked potentially dry (although that could be an unfounded fear), and veggies looked vibrant and almost appealing enough to choose. Almost.  6) Toppings. Lots and lots of toppings. If you skimp, don't expect to be as impressed. I invested time here because the menu says \"get creative.\" Definitely look into the cherry tomatoes, the feta with some additional goodies in it, the different quinoas, the pickled onions (not too tart), the pomegranate seeds (a pop of sweetness), green onion, parsley, mint, and some crunchy ingredients (sunflower seeds, crunchy chickpeas, crunchy pita bits). Just about all of those (and more) were fresh and delicious, with the except of a few yellowing sprigs of parsley.  7) Sauce(s). Garlic sauce, mint tzatziki, herb tahini, muhammara (described as roasted peppers and walnuts), hot chili harissa, house dressing (described as citrus mint). The raw garlic packs a powerful punch and both the tzatziki and tahini are awesome, but I didn't really get much out of the muhammara. I'm reminded of poke bowl places and how you can't typically get much flavor out of just one sauce, but even if you only choose one sauce for your entree here, you'll probably be very happy.  I ended up with two entrees, and I also tried some sides. While dining in, I managed to finish a pita with grilled chicken. The pita tastes great but has an awkward form factor. Not only does it not really fold readily after you load it up with toppings, but it gets pretty wet unless you deliberately stick to dry items and get sauce on the side or something. Fortunately, you can always fork and knife it if need be. The chicken was pretty good and wasn't dry.  I also took a bowl to-go but had a few good bites of it. Rice was fine. Braised lamb was delicious and tender. It was a modest but very reasonable portion of really good lamb. Where else can you get that sort of meat in relatively intact form? This really is a treat special treat.   I'm always looking out for good falafel, so I picked up a side order ($3.97 for 4 pieces). The ground and spiced chickpea balls may be vegan, but they can be remarkably delicious anyway. HUMMUS's falafel are a bit salty, but their flavor is phenomenal compared to anything else that I've had in town and at least matches if not exceeds what I've eaten elsewhere. The texture is even more remarkable, with a brilliant crispy exterior that must be tasted fresh. Omnivores and vegans alike will love this.  Pita chips ($2.31) were pretty good too, although I only had a bite. No comment on the fountain drinks ($2.59), which I didn't taste at all, but they include an uncommon soda brand and a few house-made blends. I'll consider giving those a try next time.  HUMMUS is not just one of the best adaptations of the customizable bowl model, but they're easily the best casual Mediterranean eats in the local scene. It's cheaper and more satisfying than the \"colorful\" place not too far down Eastern, and it's far superior to the local, \"modern\" Mediterranean chain which has also received Chipotle-esque comparisons. This is worth the drive even if you're clear across town.",

    "text": "A build-your-own-bowl restaurant that isn't burritos? Sign me up! Hummus is a Chipotle-like concept except with Mediterranean flavors.  There's fresh Hummus (I mean, I hope so), grilled meat, and a large variety of toppings.  There's also vegetarian options.  The food is fresh, the flavors are bright, and the combinations are basically endless.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients but perhaps not the best at managing a food line.  I've been here multiple times and every time there's been at least something that was out or nearly out. In each instance I was not offered a replacement or even an apology.  On my most recent trip I was given the crusty rice scraps with a smile and the explanation of \"looks like we're out of rice\"  For a meal that costs $10, try to be more accommodating when you are out of ingredients.  Offer me to wait until the rice is ready.  Offer me another item.  Offer an apology.  Take $1 off.  Do SOMETHING other than smile at my misfortune.  To be fair to Hummus, managing the demands of a food line is not easy.  I know it's not without challenge, and I understand that.  The part that needs a little polish is how you handle that situation with the customer.",

My bowl was an excellent value, flavor-full, beautiful to look at, and so very satisfying. I will definitely be back.    Wonderful experience...!   Great value, food, and service.",

My fav hummus is the market or spicy and I don't they get their lentils to taste so good! If you're a falafel person they are crunchy and all the Yums too.  Their toppings are awesome and so flavorful.  If they had student discounts I would be here even more frequently.  The bowls are also super instagram worthy.   The seating area is really nice too , I love the rustic feel.  Most of the staff I've interacted with are very sweet and super fun! Just one inicident one girl didn't seem to be having a good day and was getting annoyed when I was putting some toppings on and then she rushed my order to cashier and I wasn't even done yet .  We hadn't even put any dressing or crunchies on. But , everyone else has provided fantastic service!",

Shredded, melt in your mouth lamb with the perfect consistency. I won't order any other meats. They convinced me to try the beef once and it was NOT good. Dry and boring compared to the lamb. Don't get it.  \"Chipotle style\" order at the counter and seat yourself. The line can get a little long at lunch time, but way faster than any sit down place.

The location is tucked away in the shopping center but is still easy to find. The interior is clean and bright and while there is seating inside, the bowls are easy to take to go.   The food was super delicious and fresh. The owner was there when we went in to pick up dinner and told us that they make pretty much everything in house and that absolutely nothing is frozen. I decided to go with a bowl with classic hummus, lamb, and a number of toppings (my favorites were the quinoa and the pickled onion which is made in house as well). We also decided to share an order of falafel, which was a great choice as the falafel was cooked to order and absolutely perfect.   I can't wait to come back here. This is a great place to pick up a quick and healthy lunch or dinner to go and I fully intend to do that again soon.",

This is a build-your-own concept like Chipotle, poke bowls, and Subway so you choose a protein (beef, chicken, vegan falafel), a base (salad, rice, etc.), types of hummus, and tons of toppings which consist of various vegetables and nuts. Ingredients were very fresh and it comes out to approximately $10 per bowl. I highly recommend getting a bowl with the spicy hummus, braised beef, rice/salad (half of each), your choice of toppings, and their awesome garlic butter. Don't skip the garlic butter.  I wasn't impressed by their falafel, it was hard, dry, and overly salty but the rest was delicious.",

Basically chipotle style hummus bowls and wraps.  On the wrap we added Baba G., kale, romaine lettuce, black lentils, herbed tomatoes, diced beets, and a red sauce that was spicy and amazing (I forgot what they called it).   They've got a variety of hummus flavors to choose from along with a bunch of sauces like tzaziki (did I spell that right?), tahini, and red sauces and a garlic paste. Ah! So many amazing options! Gonna have to go back and try different wraps.  They've got Stubborn Soda with unique flavors and juices such as currant thyme to choose from! Let's just say I tasted every one before I decided on a drink. They're all good but I ended up with orange hibiscus.  It's a cute restaurant And they play black and white movies on the wall.

There are different types of hummus to start the base of your bowl. Then you can top it off with tons of veggies and their special house sauce. Grab yourself a cup for their freshly watermelon juice. After all that, grub up and trust me. You'll feel healthy lol.   Extra details: Creating your own bowl comes out to 8-10 bucks. The atmosphere was friendly and green. Your trendy hipster spot. Take a pic against their wall for the gram game. I did realize it can get pretty busy. And the line can be slow at times due to new people who have never tried the place before asking the workers a ton of questions aka like me.",

I think about my bowl often and can't wait to go back. My picky husband loved it too.",

We discovered it by word of mouth, one of the medical assistants told us about it. With the changes that I need to make with my heart diet is a huge part of something that I need to change. We are what we eat, totally. So she commented that we should go to HUMMUS since we were going to do lunch anyways. So here we are.  Upon first walking in the restaurant it was a bit overwhelming but the friendly staff helped me with all of my questions. I ended up getting a bowl and made it classic, with lentils and seasonal veggies with garlic sauce. The cashier told me that the garlic sauce was a house favorite and it was wonderful. I was so impressed with the staff and professionalism of the staff that I will return here too.",

I was not expecting much when I came here, but was pleasantly surprised. The food portions were right on point. Not so much that you are going to food coma and not so little that you leave hungry. They had 3 different types of hummus available (spicy was my favorite). You get to choose your choice of meat and then layer on the topping. They have a garlic butter/sauce which is definitely a must if you like garlic.   The workers here were also very pleasant and a gentleman (who i assume was the owner) came by to make sure everything came out okay. I would definitely come back again.",

Two reasons....   #1- I don't particularly like their standard hummus that they always have available. I normally enjoy their bean free market hummus selection. However, they keep changing this market hummus and sometimes it's pretty disgusting. I personally know of at least 4 times the market hummus has changed. Recently they decided to get rid of an amazing beet cauliflower hummus and replace it with some pea hummus. Can we please get some consistency in choices with the bean free hummus for those of us who do not like  beans? Babaganoush plus the market hummus are the only bean free options. Every time I find something I like it's gone! Please bring back the beet cauliflower!!!! For this reason I probably won't be going back for several months until they change the market hummus AGAIN and hopefully it's something good.  #2- The bathrooms have always been filthy dirty each time I've had to use it. Thank goodness the employees wear gloves.",

Most everything is vegetarian/vegan however they do have some meat options for those of us who want it.   Hummus is open 7 days a week from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM. A little hard to find as it is located in the back of the building. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and explained how it works. You pick a bowl or wrap, one of four hummus selections, one of five greens and then a huge selection of toppings.   For my bowl I chose: babaganoush, arugula and spinach, lentils, braised lamb, roasted vegetables, quinoa, feta cheese, pomegranate seeds and tzatziki sauce. There are so many different options here you could come back over and over and never have the same thing.   It was fresh, delicious and very filling. Service was quick and friendly and at under $10 a bowl very reasonably priced. Hummus also has three house made juices to choose from as well which all sounded wonderful. This is a great healthy option for lunch or dinner when in Henderson.",

Hummus reminds me of a Mediterranean Chipotle. Everything is prepared in front of you and looks very fresh.  I recommend getting the bowl to start because the servers load so much into the bowl that the wrap usually starts falling apart. The classic and spicy hummus are the two popular choices and are placed at the bottom of a nice treat as you dig in. I picked the black lentils for my grain, which I enjoyed.   When it comes to protein, the braised lamb is a popular choice. Unfortunately for me, they were at the very bottom of the tray for the night so whatever I got ended up being very salty. They ended up topping my bowl off with the roasted vegetables, which was appreciated, but I didn't enjoy how salty the meat was. As for the grilled chicken, I thoroughly enjoyed this protein and would recommend this in the future. It was not dry at all, and very flavorful.  As for the toppings, load it up as much as you can! Too many olives can make things too salty as well, but I love olives. As for the sauce, I love tzatziki, so that was an obvious choice for me. The pita fries are crunchy and go wonderfully as a side to share.   If it weren't for the salty lamb, I would've definitely given this place five stars, but I will be back. A great, healthy meal for under $10 is a tough find!",

What has me so impressed?   The quality is a huge factor- non-GMO and organic when possible, a large variety of textures and herbs, everything from sauces to spreads made in-house daily, and everything so fresh they don't even have a freezer. Not only is everything delicious, but add in their stellar service, Stubborn sodas, house teas, and movie wall decor? I can't NOT love this place.   I started with a bowl- the classic hummus and baba are both good picks for your base, combine your greens however you wish, pick or combine lentils and herbed rice for your carbs, and you're already looking at a hefty portion before you get to the protein and toppings! Their falafel is vegan perfection, but they also have seasonal veggies as another option. Carnivores have a huge variety and the lamb will be my next pick. Then go hog-wild with colorful and textually diverse toppings from herbed feta to cherry tomatoes, marinated onions, fresh mint, pomegranate seeds, and roasted chickpeas. If that's not enough flavor for you, add sauce- the harissa has a nice savory heat and the tzatziki is nicely cooling  but the classic garlic is my fave.   Next time I'll probably try a wrap, but now that I know how good they are, I'll likely be loading up and taking multiple meals- at under $10/order for a giant portion, why wouldn't you?",

Everything is fresh, filled with bright flavors-- I actually know because my always-maximizing Chinese mum literally asked for every topping they had and they generously doled out a fat spoonful of each without hesitation. And the flavors are so well curated that even that monstrous hodgepodge she got tasted delicious.   My family was skeptical and complain-y when I made them drive 25 minutes for a hummus place but by the time we left they were already happily talking about what they'd get next time we came. Trust me, they are VERY grudging with their acknowledgement of error.  If you haven't tried halloumi yet, do it here. It's made to order, golden and crispy on the outside. The braised lamb is excellent too.",

Open for only a few months but they have their shit together! Even though I'm not vegetarian/ vegan; I had my fill of  meat the past few days and decided to try go with veggie options. I had the wrap with babba-gannoush spread, half rice/ lentils, baby spinach, falafel balls, spiced tomatoes, quinoa tabouli, pickled onions, olives, topped with roasted red pepper & walnut spread and the tzatziki sauce drizzle. OMG. I was full-extremely satisfied but not heavy full...know what I mean? Another gem was the drinks. I had the fresh ice cold watermelon/ mint \"mockjito\" that washes it all down.  Wifey had the bowl with much of the same toppings but chose roasted veggies instead of the falafel. She washed it down with pineapple-cream soda. Awesome. Run, don't walk to this hidden gem in Henderson. A SOLID choice when looking for options other than Mexican, Italian, burgers or Chinese.  When the owner asked how my meal was...I told him \"don't change a thing! You've got a winner!\"",

There are so many that they don't have space to list them.  This can lead to other guests holding up the line while asking what each item is. They could help this by labeling their items.   I will be back again. They do have a solid concept, and I left full and happy.",

Upon entering this cute little eatery I see it's decorated nicely (less is more), and is very clean and bright inside. You basically build your meal like a Chipotle or Qdoba. The girl at the counter was very helpful and walked me through how it works and explained all the options.  You can choose hummus, baba Ganoush, or some other puree type thing for your bottom layer. Other options include rice, lentils, various greens, tom, cuc, olives, pickled onion, etc. Toppings include sunflower seeds, roasted chickpeas, and crumbled pita chips.  Since it was my first time I tried a little of everything. My protein was the falafel. Not extremely authentic flavors, but at least they were fresh and good quality. And to have the option of these flavors instead of another build your own taco or burrito place is a welcome thing!  My total along with a drink (currant thyme juice mixed w the cucumber blossom-yumm!) was $11. Very reasonable.  Giving this 4 stars for being fresh, being innovative & having a different option when hungry for something quick, and for the great service I received.",

The bowl situation is pretty cool, feel like you're getting chipotle or something but with a different flavor profile. Their fountain sodas are all interesting as well I believe they are all organic with cane sugar or agave, the flavor I tried was pineapple cream soda and it was pretty good.

The owner of this restaurant needs to hire another person to work the front or the owner should work during busy times. I really want to love this place and return but was so turned off by waiting 20 mins just to order 1 bowl. No ones fault I guess expect maybe better management and planning.

Flavors are out of this world good and the atmosphere is very nice. I got the salad bowl with tons of toppings on it! Definitely stop in here for lunch! The hummus is amazing and we got a dessert on the house that is done type of chickpea peanut butter mouse but holy cow It was amazing!! My favorite spot!!!",

Rather than feeling heavy after eating, I feel completely energized while being full (thought about getting more to go just to have some more for later). I got lamb the first time around but I will definitely be back to try to chicken. Did I mention the sauces are amazing!!! Don't forget to try all the soda flavors. Super yummy!",

The customer service was wonderful, the food was fresh and delicious and the toppings were all available. I was so happy I visited 3 more times in a matter of 2 weeks and it was consistently good. I've been obsessed with getting the roasted veggies because they are always perfectly cooked and again, FRESH. My husband and I are in love. Thank you so much for listening to my concerns. You guys are doing a great job.",
