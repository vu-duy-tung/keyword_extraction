    "text": "Ordered dinner to pick up at 7:30pm this past Monday. We get home and they forgot the lettuce wraps. The order was not huge we only spent $55. All the sauces were there but no lettuce wraps. So I call to let them know we will be back to pick up the forgotten items. We go back to pick up the lettuce wraps the manager apologized and took off the lettuce wraps from bill . We start driving home and I look in the bag and there's literally 2 of the tiniest pieces of lettuce I have ever seen! So we have to turn around , again, and call them and they bring out more lettuce, which is still small. So we finally get back home at 8:45. The Mongolian beef we ordered that cost over $17 was such a small portion, the sweet and sour chicken is now cold and soggy. Ugh, so disappointed, I use to really like this place. But I won't be back.",

I had a reservation and they were busy when I walked in... however instead of asking if I had a reservation they treated me like an inconvenience and tried to tell me it'd be 30 minutes. When I said I had a reservation the one perked right up to help the other just gave me a stink face. Also, with two-three girls at the front door, the windows of the front doors and bathrooms were atrocious... if that's how they keep their front of house clean.... what goes on in back of house ??!",

Should have ordered the side of fried rice, but it only comes plain. Like pork fried rice, so had to order full size. Hardly any pork and flavorless. Lots to take home to jazz up. Two mango ice teas.

So let me start off by saying if you want superb service, Lawrence is your guy!  Let's get down to the food. We ordered the lettuce wraps, fried green beans and cream cheese ragoons. Man! What better way to start a meal with those 3. Hands down delicious! Those will always be my all time favorites for a starter.  For our main course, we ordered the Mongolian beef, crispy honey chicken, chicken Lo Mein and the honey walnut shrimp with melon. I have to say, my family picked the perfect dishes to share. We had 4 kids in our party that actually ate each of the different dishes and enjoyed it. Nothing on each plate was overdone as far as flavor. I found it interesting that they put melon in the honey walnut shrimp. I never ate it that way before but I have to say, the blend was not bad. The sweetness  was subtle and the bite all together had a nice flavor pairing to the palette.  Dessert was the cherry on top. We shared the fried banana spring rolls with ice cream. What a magical dish! lol I was full but helped myself to a whole lot of that! I tried my sons cheesecake, man.... PF Changs knows what they're doing! That was probably the BEST cheesecake I ever had! I will definitely be back to this specific location because the service was over the top! My experience with the staff, even right when I first came in, was very pleasant. To the guys (I didn't get their names) who brought over our dishes and to the guy who boxed our leftovers were all very polite. I love coming to a restaurant where you can get really good food and the right treatment of service. Every restaurant should always be like this. Thank you to the management who hired all the amazing staff, you have a great team!!! Definitely will be back!",

Tonight it was pathetic and the two large portions I ordered were smaller then the small I got last week and no where near the large size my wife and daughter shared.  There were virtually no strawberries and looked like something 7/11 would have sold at 50%off and the end of the day. Guess we are done with take out there and will stick to the Cheesecake Factory for any desert we order out in the future.",

And he promptly placed the order to go.  I expect good service from our server, which quite honestly was subpar, considering we had two wait staff switching off at our table, Michelle and Vicky but i am writing this review for Marcus and his professionalism he showed making our celebration one to remember.

The entire meal was extremely bland and was soaking wet in whatever sauce was on it.  My husband also got a chicken entree and described the chicken as being chewy and dry.  He's not one to be picky with his food and agreed that everything was very plain and substandard.  And as usual, I have to comment on the coffee.  The waitress told us the coffee was probably old and to let her know if she needed to make a new pot.  Ummmm, how about you just make the fresh pot instead of taking the chance of serving us lukewarm, old coffee.  The flavor was also blah, as well.  I never thought I would say this, but I would eat at Pei Wei before I ever eat at PF's again (and I don't think Pei Wei is all the great).  Our bill came to like $60, which is way too much for the quality of food that was served.  We agreed this place will be crossed off our list!",

But of course its gone now, And A lot of the items on the menu are run of the mill Asian fast food on fancy plates in a fancy setting.. Pretty much FAIL.. I would recommend avoiding..

I won't be going back...get charged 2.50 for extra chicken only to pick up my meal and I literally dug through it with my fingers after believing they had given me a vegetarian option of mein....for those that don't know the chicken is cut into tiny inch length pieces....when I was done sifting through the mess I counted 8...So if this is what extra looks like than what is the normal amount...for a dish costing 10+ dollars.....so I call the restaurant to have the manager simply refund the cost of extra chicken..I then ask what the normal amount of chicken is and am told four ounces at which point I said well that's good to know and then he hung up the phone!!! Great customer service.....I did not have anywhere close to four ounces food scales are wonderful things....so what then was I charged for 12.50 for a bowl of soggy noodles by the time I got to sit down to eat? Thanks pf changs...keep my 23 bucks.. And just know you've lost a customer.",

Every time I call to see what the wait is like, they act like i am asking for something insane and put me on hold for a couple min.  Never experienced that at any other establishment",

The last time we came here was about 2 yrs ago, we ordered take out and the server decided to add a tip on our bill without our knowledge then we caught it later.  So we eventually received a gift card and we didn't use it until tonight.  We must have had the slowest waiter who made us wait super long for our bill and then gave us big bills for change.  So sneaky, then I had to wait up front to try and get change then low and behold it was the same darn waiter up front who ended up giving me the change.  So disappointed because we tried to give them another chance with no prevail!!!",

    "text": "SInce my girlfriend is a huge fan of Chinese food, I have found myself eating at this place on more than a few occasions.   PF Chang's is essentially a large chain of Chinese dine-in restaurants, but they try to set themselves apart from the competition with their somewhat upscale decor and diverse food choices. For the most part, they succeed. I believe they have 4 restaurants in the Vegas Valley, give or take, so there should be one not too terribly far from you regardless of where you are.   If you're a fan of Chinese food but sick of the same old stuff everywhere you go, PF Chang's may be the breath of fresh air you need. From traditional choices right down to some unusual stuff you never would have dreamt possible, they cover all the bases. I don't think I have honestly ever came in here and not liked my food. Soup, appetizers, entrees, they have choices galore and i have never had a bad one.  The atmosphere is a little more luxurious than you are likely used to in a Chinese restaurant, but it still tends to get a bit loud during peak hours. Every time I have come in here, the staff have always been friendly and good about making recommendations.   If I have one complaint, it is that the prices are a little higher than other Chinese dining options. However, it is definitely somewhat justified for the level of diversity you get here, compared to other dining experiences in the area.  In the end I have to strongly recommend PF Chang's, even if it does get a little hectic during peak hours and you have to pay a little more for quality food.",

The table was also not prepared as requested. I ordered the surf and turf. The steak was severely over cooked, the lobster and shrimp tasted like pure oil. I kept trying to get through it but finally asked the waiter for some kind of sauce to try and eat it. Eventually I gave up. I walked outside and put my baby in the car only to realize we hadn't grabbed our to go bag. I went back in and a different waiter told me they threw it away already... our waiter did comp our appetizer and gave me a birthday cake. The waiter was attentive and polite. For an 80 dollar plus bill it was a horrible meal I'd prefer not to remember. I have honestly had better shrimp in Afghanistan.... let that sink in for a second or two.",

The green beans are crispy and batter complements the veggies. The sauce is creamy and spicy.  Very addicting.  Obviously the go to is the lettuce wraps.    We always order the sea bass.  Just because why not.   It's sweet and fatty and just so delicious. Over a bed of spinach.  Kids love the chicken lo mein and the surf and turf.    Banana egg rolls for dessert and kids always get the chocolate wall cake with the raspberry sauce. But 1 star deducted bc this time the cake was crunchy.  With every bite there seemed to be like rice crispy or something in it.  Very weird.",

Good food and a great atmosphere, you're just missing some good people to take with you to enjoy it with!   Customer service: Their customer service has been impeccable, I've been here several times and they're always very friendly and attentive checking in with you frequently.  Cuisine: Recently I have been coming in for their lunch specials and for $10.99 you just can't beat the quality. I've had the Chicken curried ramen noodles and it is just fantastic, this dish really hit the spot leaving me full and for just 2.99 you can get a side salad. I think I had the cabbage crunch salad and wow it is deceivingly tasty with a very nice suttle dressing with some crunchy texture. What a good combo. Another dish worth trying is the Mongolian beef bowl, a good amount of beef with a nice sweet tangy sauce on it with plenty of rice. Im sure I'll be back to try more lunch items.  Given it being the lunch special I still need my coffee and their coffee is surprisingly good. I would say bold. Well done PF Chang's!  Ambiance: It's a nice atmosphere with table and booth seating. The music is just the right tone. I'll have to go for dinner one of these days.  Location: Conveniently located at the District shopping center, grab a bite then go shop!",

The best salad I've ever had was the Mandarin Crunch  salad with a side of shrimp. About as fresh as a salad can get with cabbage, carrots, mango,almonds and a few  other ingredients topped with delicious Mandarin vinaigrette dressing. Excellent.  One friend had a Caesar salad with a side of grilled salmon... That's going to be my next one. Looked  delicious and she loved it.  Pad Thai and Mongolian Beef  were the two other girls choices, But glad I ordered the Mandarin Crunch salad... It was awesome!  Service of course is always good here And the ambience is too... At least it was after we asked them to turn down the loud music.",

Whoever came up with this needs to be educated in customer service and relations.  The management does not check in..and seems uninterested in the customer.  If you charge what you charge then make it worth it.  Sorry again, but do you think the customer is stupid??",

The tofu was overcooked and tasted like dried rubber, and the dressing/sauce was almost pure vinegar. It was the first time I'd ever left lettuce wraps on my plate, they were that bad. I don't know if I'll ever go back to this location.",

We enjoyed the Crispy Avocado Spring Rolls, shared the Mongolian beef (my personal fave), Orange Peel chicken, and fried rice! She was super sweet throughout the whole experience. I asked for the sauce trio and she offered to mix it to mild, medium, or spicy which honestly, never happens when I ask for it. I usually have to mix it myself but she did good! We go to that location a lot and service is good but she was amazing!!!",

    "text": "Came in on this cold rainy day to warm up with a bowl of wonton soup. Usually stellar service with a personable outgoing bartender for the past 15 years I've come in here. I was solo and sat at the bar. The 30-something female bartender honestly had a less than stellar attitude. She asked if I wanted a menu, and I said yes. I asked her how her day was going and in a \"don't really give a sh*t\" tone she said \"It's going.\"    She is pregnant, so perhaps that's the reason for her less than stellar-ness with a \"non-regular.\"!Alllllrighty then. She goes off and talks to other people for minutes and finally brings me the menu. I have it less than 30 seconds and she returns and asks if I'm ready to order. I asked what the price of a certain drink was, and she looked at me as if I was asking her the dumbest question. She said \"Like 10-11 something I guess.\" Wow. I get my soup, and there's not a lot of wontons or veggies like there usually is. Bartender never once asked me if everything was okay, could she get me anything else, nothing. All the while she chatted with what seemed to be regulars. I grabbed my keys and wallet off the bar and she must have sensed I was Finished eating. Never asked me if I wanted dessert, nothing. Cashed me out and put my bill on the bar without a word, but I got the fortune cookie on top. I just looked st bottom of receipt at the \"Gratuity Not Included.\" Indeed. Not today, Bartender Vicky (it was on the bill). If you don't like your job, then get a new one. Treat all customers the same, and don't pay special attention to \"regulars.\" Makes folks like me NOT want to return, ever.",

    "text": "In October 2014, friends & I met at this location for drinks & dinner. Our experience was so bad I emailed PF CHANGS a complaint at the table, while Daniel acted like a 2 year old.  PF CHANGS responded requesting additional information; below is what I sent them. It should be important to note I also emailed Daniel's boss, some area manager whose response was simply \"sorry about that; I will use your experience in an upcoming training session.\"    Upon receipt of PF CHANGS gift card that was emailed to me...1 $25 e-card for 3 people...2 of us went to redeem it & the server had to get a manager involved; Daniel immediately recognized me, was a total arse, and I was shocked our food wasn't poisoned.   It has taken me this long to write this review because I have been so bothered by it.  While we will never return, it's important for others to know you will have problems at this location and the unprofessional management will make a bad situation worse. The whole point was giving them a chance to redeem themselves. BLEW. IT.   ** Just so you know, our initial complaint originated at the bar during happy hour.  The bartender was not pleasant, which I suppose we can look past. Let's be honest, we all have our off days while at work. However, my mate and I had ordered the Pinot Grigio off the happy hour menu and prior to the end of the hour we ordered another round. The bartender told us they were \"completely out\" of ALL Pinot Grigio's in the restaurant and made no additional suggestions. Once seated at our table, and about 45 minutes later (it took us awhile to order because we were busy talking and not paying attention to the menu), we mentioned our bar experience to our server Lawrence who informed us they did have Pinot Grigio in stock and quickly brought us a glass.   Dumbfounded, that is when we asked for the manager.  My mate wasn't even 5 words into her sentence when the manager Daniel interrupted her and boldly announced they were out of ALL Pinot Grigio, that an hour beforehand HE told the bartender to stop sales of it which is why we were told they were completely out of it. He went on to say the bartender did nothing wrong as he was following HIS command. Yes, the manager used that word.  When I pointed out we were just brought a glass of Pinot Grigio and questioned how could that be if they were out, he interrupted me and said we were brought a Pinot Gris. Which is not what we ordered (nor was it deducted from our bill).  It was at that point we asked he leave our table as I wrote the complaint you received. (I mentioned to Daniel as he placed his hands on his hips & stomped away I was writing the complaint. \"do it. See if I care!\" Was his response.)  My mates and I were there for several hours and our server Lawrence was beyond exceptional.  We might have left had it not been for him.  Daniel's total lack of professionalism, disrespect, and immaturity displayed towards us was repeatedly apologized for by Lawrence. While appreciated, it was not his place to apologize for the epic fail on behalf of this manager.  Of note, during our time at the restaurant, the manager stood at the pass and glared at us the rest of the night.  Aside from the shock we felt by the way your manager spoke AT us as well as his behavior, what I find most disturbing about this experience is that the he sent Lawrence to our table with a $30 gift card as his way of apologizing. The manager should have brought this to us himself, not send it over with Lawrence.  Reluctantly we took it and while on our way out, I discarded it.",

Your review not only makes this pf changs location look bad but it also justifies our claim of how rude you were to us. Yelp is for guest to write about their personal experience. Who are you to decide how we felt about our experience?  I work in the food industry, all of my friends that night work in customer service. Why the hell would we come into a restaurant \"wanting a bad experience\" ? We aren't looking for anything in return, we are just trying to warn future guest about your horrible customer service. You were rude all night, and you did not attend to us at all. The busser was more of a server to us then you. Yeah I get it, half of us showed up late, but you could of at least tried to hide your aggravation.  If someone insist on boxing there own food, LET THEM. If someone doesn't want 11 different cups on the table, TAKE THE CUPS AWAY. If someone looks like there done eating, ASK BEFORE YOU TAKE THERE PLATE AWAY. There's so many things you could of done to make our experience pleasant, but you were in a rush and cared more about your other tables then us since you saw us as \"inconsiderate kids\". And to top it off you wrote the 20% tip on the top, how unprofessional can you get. Since I work in the food industry I always tip over 20% since I know the servers need to tip out the host and bussers. But you didn't deserve that.  However I feel like everyone is entitled to their own opinion, if not I would run around the internet calling you liar and a horrible server, oh wait...",

The service on the other hand was not so great. I don't know the servers name as he never introduced himself but he was tall with greying hair. He was present some of the time. I feel like we were not that important to him. Maybe because we are younger and typically the younger crowd doesn't tip as well but it's not always wise to pre judge people. When it came time to pay the check I left cash in the book and I've never seen a server move that fast to get to the check as we were leaving. Maybe he thought we were walking out on our tab, I don't know.  On our way out my wife waved and said thank you to him but we were met with only a blank stare. To the server: I know it can be confusing when someone thanks you and tips you 20% despite your sub-par service but try not to show it next time. It's unbecoming.  Overall I give this location 3 stars.  Great job to the kitchen Front of house needs improvement",

Complimentary valet will win me over time and time again and its location is wonderful if you want to walk across the street and walk that meal off!  Or...sit on a nice bench.  Haha.  Every single time I have been to this location the service has been nothing less of stellar.  I order water a lot when I go out (I don't really do soda) and automatically get stereotyped as \"poor college student that won't tip\" (which, by the way, is unTrue) so I get the cold shoulder service.  Not so, even in a place like this.  It's not Morton's but it's still upscale in comparison to Chili's and even Carrabbas.  What to order: Chicken lettuce wraps, Kung Pao chicken (ask the server for extra spicy...if you can handle it!), P.F. Chang's fried rice with chicken (add cashews), and their diet-melting-but-to-die-for dessert spring rolls.  Yum yum yum!  Great atmosphere to de-stress, get a martini, and munch on some awesome food.",

I've been to P.F.Chang's for the first time about 6 years ago so I did not remember anything about this place...  We walked in, and I have no Idea why, but we had to wait for 10 minutes or so. It was 12pm and they had a bit of lunch rush going, but still, 10 minutes? But that's wasn't a big deal. I liked the ambiance of this place though.  Now, our server wasn't too bad. He had good attitude and he was trying his best to do the whole \"suggestive selling\" thing... BUT I couldn't help but to see other servers who obviously weren't trained properly or didn't have any experience in f&b. At one point, I saw a server reaching across someone to serve, while the person quickly dodged her arm frowning unhappily... really?  and the wait for our food was excruciating. I was hungry to begin with when I walked in the restaurant but it took good 40 minutes for our food to hit the table... 40 minutes during lunch when there are not that many people in the restaurant? the food wasn't even that great. I got sesame chicken lunch bowl and although I liked the fact that it had a lot of vegetables, it was too salty. In fact, everything we ordered was a little bit too salty, from soup to our entrees. Maybe it's the kitchen at this location? But I'm not going back to this one if I were to go to P.F.Chang's again.   Oh yeah, and a bit overpriced too, but that might be because of the restaurant's fancy looks.",

The home made wan ton sauce was to die for. Then went on to the egg drop soup. Again, a wonderful choice. It was outstanding. I ordered the mongolia beef and upgraded to fried rice for $1 extra. The fried rice was nothing remarkable. Just so-so. The mongolian beef was worthless. It was nothing. The onions added nothing. It was very disappointing. The extras were all good but the main entree dropped the ball. Service was very good. Overall rating, not worth the high $$. Even Panda Express's beef is better.",

    "text": "To end the weekend, I decided to meet a friend I've never seen in a long time, for dinner. We agreed on PF Changs as we both love Asian foods. Years back, I worked for Lucille's restaurant around the corner. During those days, I would frequent PF's because it was convenience. Since working there, I haven't been to PF's so I was excited to wine and dine!  Located in the District, once you exit the 215, turn down south on Green Valley, make the immediate right and you'll see PF Chang's. As a stand alone building, you have the luxury of private parking, but be advised, it isn't big. On busy nights, you'll have to park in the main district parking. Approaching the restaurant, you'll notice an outdoor seating area, left of the front doors. Once you enter, the main focal point is a hand painted Asian mural, which looked super cool and depicted some form of historic event. The main bar is located underneath the mural and most of the dining area is to the right. As we were seated, I noticed the mural continued throughout the dining room. There were other Asian artwork and Chinese statues solidifying the type of restaurant. The larger ceiling lights weren't as bright as you would expect and coupled with the dim red lighting on the outskirts of the dining room, it made for a great date night spot. For dinner, our server was super nice. She was accommodating and ensured our orders were correct. That's one thing I was appreciative of. She kept asking questions and I definitely felt our needs were being met. Now that's good service!  For dinner, I wanted to start with an adult like drink. I chose to go with the 2012 Estancia Pinot Grigio for $8 a glass. I actually liked this brand. I felt the wine was super crisp, with a fruity taste with a tangy/zesty type finish. I would recommend this wine again! For dinner, I decided to go with one of their signature appetizers, the Chang's chicken lettuce wraps for $8.95. As described on the menu, wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts served over crispy rice sticks with lettuce cups. The chicken and mushrooms had the same texture so I'm super glad they chose the crunchy chestnut texture. The flavor was jam packed in the dish, kind of borderline salty. The rice sticks were good and crispy. I felt though, the oiliness of the sticks and the oil from the sauce was a little much. I was hoping for more of a health conscious dish, but there was a little too much oil to consider this dish healthy. I know, I know, I should have gone with a salad. I just wanted to try something else!   At the end of the day, my meal was definitely OK. There's no reason for me NOT to return. I think PF Chang's offers a lot of great dishes. This one was just not the best I've had, but I know I'll be back to check something else out in the near future. Great spot to hang with some cool friends!",

    "text": "\"Tastefully Expensive\" is how I would describe this restaurant. Their food: amazing. Love it every time. But very pricey in my opinion. The whole atmosphere is nice, best for business lunches/dinners and maybe some classy dates.   Although, the hostesses need to learn some manners. The waiters/waitresses are usually very friendly and talkative, but the ladies at the front need to be less cold towards the customers. Once for lunch, my friends and I went in dressed with flip flops and shorts. The woman at the front shriveled her nose and looked at us up and down, placing us in the very back of the empty restaurant (we moved ourselves to a nicer seat after she left) and the waiter was apologetic. Other times I've overheard the hostesses whispering to each other, complaining about the children in the place, or even making fun of some of the customers. I get that its supposed to be a \"high-end bistro\" but those ladies could learn a thing or two from the much friendlier waiters/waitresses. If you're going to complain about your job, do it on Facebook, not within earshot of your customers.",

On the flipside of that I'm glad to see this location only has three star reviews because really it is not worth much more. I had not been to PF Changs in 10 years and thought I would try it again last night. Took a long time to get a drink to start with. Considering it wasn't busy, makes me wonder.   I asked for light ice in my drink so instead he refused to fill it up to compensate for the lack of ice and so as to not benefit me with extra beverage.  Not only that, even though it could've been a tasty little drink,  it was a strawberry cucumber lime aid and you couldn't even drink the damn thing because the little straw kept getting clogged up with all the cucumber and strawberry in it. I got a very dissatisfying four dollar drink which was more like a shot and I couldn't even enjoy it.   The orange chicken was terrible so I sent it back and got the honey chicken which was no better than anything you would find in Chinatown, only it was six dollars more than what you would pay in Chinatown. My husband got some ho-hum lobster sauce dish. Calamari was OK. Had it been 30% or more less it would've been a fine deal. But all they do is sell the same Chinese crap you would find in Chinatown only they sell it for a lot more. Once every 10 years was evidently too much for this place.   We felt rushed there. The whole time. Annoying.   They don't care but it's OK, I got it off my chest. I see there's a bunch of poor reviews and management just doesn't respond. Why bother frequenting a place that doesn't even give a shit that you had a shitty time? Go elsewhere people.",

    "text": "This is probably one of the worst experiences at this P.F. Chang's yet. First I ordered take out as I just had foot surgery today and am unable to walk. Luckily for me I had someone who could pick up my dinner for me. I ordered xtra sauce for the Kung Pao chicken which is usually So dry you have to add sauce. After getting my food I found that there was no sauce for the Kung Pao and the crispy green beans were one huge pile of breading. The green beans were so shriveled they looked like they were sitting there for weeks. Couldn't even eat them. I did call the restaurant and spoke with the manager Juan who sounded like he didn't give 2 f**ks!  He took my name and address and said I will send you a gift card. Well that doesn't help me with dinner for tonight!  That seems to be their answer to all of the bad reviews. Maybe instead of sending  $5 or $10 gift cards you might want to actually address the problems.  The Green valley location is a lot closer to my house but I will be driving further to go to town square their food is 100 times better.",

I dropped my soup bowl (I overfilled it, it's just so delicious!) and they immediately rushed to help me, they gave a new, fresh bowl of soup to me, some napkins, they cleaned it, and were very patient with it all. Chelsea is very kind, attentive, patient, and fun to talk to.  She is a large part of the 5 star review. If you are here ask for Chelsea!  I absolutely love this place and even though the food is semi-expensive, it is worth it.  P.S. only get the dessert if you have room, you will be so full and won't be able to eat it, you will be sad because you will love it so much, you will cry because you can't eat it all! Trust me!",

We got there this last time just before happy hour ended. Ordered our usual treats. We were sitting in a booth overlooking 3 tables of seniors. We are people watchers. Just observant. No disrespect, but they did nothing but complain. We stayed on a bit and it started to get crowded and some people became impatient. Really, on a Friday?   When I go out to eat on a Friday night unless I make reservations, and even then you need to be a bit flexible, what do you expect?  Love the Margarita and the calamari with tempura veggies! A real winner!",

    "text": "I love their food but unfortunately had one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had here this weekend. I chose to bring my fiance here for her Birthday dinner as she has never been to this restaurant. Upon arrival the hostess confirmed that she noticed we were there for a birthday, and wished her a happy birthday which was a nice start but once we were sat at our table things quickly went downhill. It was at least 10 min (I think it was longer as we contemplated just walking out) before we were even greeted with menu's and offered a beverage. The waitress knew it had been a long time and apologized for the wait and  said they were just very busy. However, several other tables around us got their menu's, and drinks immediately as one would expect. It took another 15 min to get us our cocktails and the waitress again apologized and we were finally able to get our order in. She did bring us some free salad soup because she knew the food was going to be a while which was another nice touch but again the food took a REALLY long time. Again, the people around us that were sat after us were getting their food before us? When we were finished eating it took her another 10 min to get to us with our check. After everything was said, and done it was an hour and 30 min from the time we were sat at our table to getting our check in our hands - we are pretty fast eaters too. The worst part is the server never acknowledged my fiance's Birthday, or offered a desert so we just ended up going somewhere else for that portion of our meal.",

    "text": "My wife's colleagues come here for happy hour pretty frequently and I'll stop by to join. She mainly wants to go for their lettuce wraps and we usually don't stay for a full meal. I remembered why after we came for dinner on a Tuesday with a gift certificate. The combo was a pretty good deal, the service was good, the food was just OK with nothing really standing out or memorable.  We were seated for our late dinner at 9:15 in one of the U-shaped booths against the wall that faces the kitchen. We had a peaceful dinner in the Asian themed, but modern dining area. The menu is varied demarcating which dishes are spicy, vegetarian, lighter, or new. Our server was Galyna who took good care of us and was very friendly.  The dinner for two for $42.95 is comprised of two soups, one appetizer, two entrees, and one dessert. The egg drop soup and hot and sour soup were standard. The pork dumplings drizzled with a chili sauce were probably the best dish of the night. The minuscule amounts of chicken we found in the chicken lo mein were dry and I didn't go for the sauce in the pepper steak, not much of a garlic or a pepper bite. The banana spring rolls didn't save the entrees but they were a tasty finish.  We appreciate that everything is made from scratch, but this restaurant is designed to put out volume like other chains. I think their happy hour where everything is $6 is solid. If you come for dinner, the \"dim sum\" items have been the most consistent and flavorful for us.",

The waiter took our drinks order right away 5mns later he came back to get our food order. we ordered Salad wrap and ahi tuna (appetizers) You can't go wrong with it: Light, refreshing  We picked Mongolian beef, Singapore chicken and chicken khamphao with brown rice. my Mongolian beef was too cooked and crispy on the edge of my pieces of beef :( little too salty Chicken khamphao was \"plain\". The only dish that came up great was the Singapore chicken. it has a kick of spiciness. We went to PF Chang to catch up with a friend we haven't seen for some time. We were enjoying our time together and our meal, the waiter came asking if we wanted to place an order for dessert... hmmm we are still eating.... I told him we will see once we finish dinner. 10mns later he came back with our check, he added \"take your time\"! Sure!!!! I think he came 2 more time see if i placed my credit card for payment like he was in a hurry for us to leave the restaurant...  I was so annoyed that I told him I would let him know once we are ready to pay and leave...  No dessert, no coffee tonight LOL, might not come back to this PF Chang location either ...",

Every time you'd drink, the straw would get plugged. Frustrating & annoying.  Lettuce wraps - heavy on the large water chestnut pieces. Most likely won't be back unless someone else insists.",

But when they double checked it was there and the staff had written down 2 pick up times. One at 5:30 and one at 6. Got there and waited for 15mins for food cause tadaaa to my surprise no one had put it in even after i called. Got home only to find out they put everything in my order WRONG. Called the place, manager asked me to come back. WHY am i driving back when you guys made me wait and gave me the run around on the phone. Unprofessional staff.

You're going to get very safe food that caters to the cautious eater.  Service was good. I got my refills as well as menu recommendations for my first time visit.  Environment is also very welcoming for groups, keeping it trendy, somewhat upscale, with a mix of casual.  As for the food... -Tofu lettuce wraps: Decent. Sauce was overpowering enough that I could barely even taste anything else. -Crispy Honey Chicken: This dish reminded me of something I could get at Panda Express.. with 25% more meat. -Sweet & Sour Chicken: Also another dish that tasted like food court food, but double the price. -Mandarin Chicken: A sort of chicken stir fry. Nothing impressive about this basic dish.  Maybe for happy hour dim sum, this place would be an okay stop after a day of work. For dinner, it was a huge disappointment. You're pretty much paying for the atmosphere, not the food. I would probably come back if I were invited, just because it's a nice place to kick back and relax with friends. I definitely wouldn't go back on my own will though.",

While they have vegetarian items on the menu, I think they just don't pay a whole lot of attention to the taste in their meals.  I've had a couple of versions of tofu and vegetables, and while you can't go too wrong with fried tofu, the sauces were just flavorless... With vegetarian meals, spices and flavor is essential... Few folks want to pay $14 for a pile of steamed veggies in a barely flavored goo...   On the flip side, my friends love their Orange Chicken, and cream cheese wontons (which I agree are awesome, but fried dough and cream cheese is always awesome).  I've never had anything here that made me say \"I can't wait to come back and have this again\", so I say \"meh\".",

    "text": "Really Sang? PF Changs? EVERYONE has been there...  Aha..I can challenge you on that! One of my friends has actually literally NEVER been to PF Changs so after hearing that blasphemy I carted her away to this location  for her to try the wonders of massacred Chinese food.   PF Changs is not Chinese food. It's American food. I don't even think they are trying to elude that their food comes from the Fujian or Yunnan provinces. It's just food that tastes good. And for that, I like this place. It's dependable with it's dark woods, lightings, concrete-looking horses, decent service and reasonable prices.   I get their Ma Po Tofu but instead of steamed broccoli that usually comes with the dish, I substitute with eggplant (yes, the same eggplant in their spicy eggplant). It's like I get 2 dishes but don't have to be a glutton and can practice portion control! Voila! Also, they don't charge me extra for this ($8.95). Their side dish options come in 2 sizes. The small sized options (about $3) easily satisfy 2 people. I enjoy the Crispy Green Beans, Spicy Asparagus and Shanghai Cucumbers. So when me and the hubs pander over here, we get the Ma Po Tofu (note eggplant sub) and 2 small sides. Cost of meal? About $15 bucks. Ummmm...for a sit-down place that's relatively nice, that's a steal! And our tummies are always happy after!  There are more \"interesting\" places around and yes, it's not independently owned and really a blasphemy for True Asian cuisine. But it's my guilty pleasure...good food, nice surroundings, sensitive to people preferring smaller portion sizes and impeccable service. '  And I'll even admit that after getting denied entry due to the size of our group at our favorite Austin, TX restaurant, PF Changs was the site where my bachelorette mayhem began. I'm not going to be pretentious today and admit that I like this place. Lots!",

The Orange chicken is amazing! This location in particular is pretty quite, not too much traffic and wait is normally not as long as others in town. If you love fruity, blended drinks, try the Nutty Uncle w/whip cream-SHIT\"S THE BOMB! It's no longer on the menu but they will make for you if you ask. ;-)",

I don't go to a restaurant thinking my arrival is a such a burden.  The minute we got there you were giving us attitude and treating us like a bunch of kids who came in to be rude, loud and have a purpose of being annoying. And before I forget, why were arguing with me about how many cups.of water were at the table? They were 4 people and 8 glasses of water. There's no excuse for taking someone's food too early, I've never seen that happen. There's a difference between asking the guest \"Any dessert for tonight?\" And \"any are we ready for free (whether they are or not) birthday dessert? And to top it off you came back with a bill saying you added 20 percent to the gratuity because of the trouble we put you thru...",

From the description on the menu, the lamb sounded indian as it had been marinated and then cooked in cumin. Indian tasting chinese food doesn't sound appealing..but he assured me it was yum. We also tried a desert cup which is a perfectly sized desert in a shot glass...both the choclate cake with rasberry sauce and the rasberry cheesecake were good..

My main complaint is that they, for an unknown reason,  serve the Merlot chilled,  which is what my girlfriend drinks only.  When we got the drink, even the waiter said that other customers complained the Merlot was chilled.  He said the manager did this. He offered to microwave the merlot for us!   I had mentioned going their for dinner the other night, and my girlfriend declined based on the chilled Merlot.    So if you, Mr. Manager, read this, chill out and stop chilling the Merlot. Room Temperature is fine and what everyone else serves it at.   This may not seem like a big deal but it is for my girlfriend and now I can't enjoy their food.  :(  She lives in Henderson.",

This trip I decided to munch on the lettuce wraps, pork dumplings (steamed) and some new happy hour tacos. Fortunately one order of the tacos were wrong and I got them free. I had shrimp and mahe-mahe. While they were both of good quality, both were skimpy on size and flavor. In fact, they were quite plain. I would avoid these fill you belly with something good and flavorful.   The dumplings and wraps were as good as ever.   We had the \"great wall of . . .\" chocolate cake. It's a multi-layered piece of dense chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, and chocolate chips (which I could do without). It's served with delicious raspberry sauce and berries (blue, ras, and straw). Delicious. Make sure to share.",

Some of the items (I'm looking at you Hong Kong Seabass) are rather pricey for the portions, but are quite good! I especially love the crispy honey chicken, the Hong Kong Seabass (sign up for the rewards program, and then try it when you have a free entree!), the crispy green bean appetizer, and the salt and pepper calamari appetizer. I would pick those four items as my hands-down favorites.   The staff here have always been pleasant, and whenever an issue has come up, it has been addressed and taken care of promptly. I appreciate the effort that the staff here put into making your experience a positive one.",

In my younger days there was only one in town (Flamingo / Paradise) and it was a guaranteed date night staple.   Ordered the food online which was very easy and allowed you to select a pick up time.  Got there about 10 minutes early and the place was very well laid out, friendly staff, and the food was ready to go. This was a pleasant surprise, but the only one of the night.  Upon arriving home, I laid out the food, made my plate, and dived in with anticipation.  I must say my level of dissatisfaction only stopped before devastated due to the wine I was consuming.  The several different dishes that were ordered (see pictures) had no flavor, seemed thrown together,  and were all very bland.  The one dish I was most looking forward to, the chicken lettuce wraps, was no were near what I remembered. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery.  The different types of noodles all tasted like they were cooked with the same sauce. The food reminded me of the frozen food section, and not the great restaurant of days past.  Needless to say my food heart was broken as I felt I had met an old friend that had changed beyond recognition.  One star for the friendly prompt staff, well laid out environment, and ease of ordering; but that was the only highlight of this experience.",

Recently I've been trying to go Gluten and Dairy free to see if it helps some health issues. I really appreciate a restaurant that has a dedicated Gluten Free menu. It makes things so much easier. I hate feeling like I'm being high maintenance for needing special requests.   Tonight's meal was perfect. I started with a cup of GF Egg Drop soup $3.50, for my entree I ordered GF Changs Spicy Chicken $14.95 and GF Half Spinach with Garlic $3.95. Everything was so good. The Gluten free food is only about $1 or so more than the regular food and it was seriously so good. Plus I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Double yay!  Make sure you ask for GF soy sauce. They need to bring it from the back. The stuff on the table is not gluten free.   We sat at the bar and the staff was great, especially Philip (I think that was his name - on the receipt) Our drinks were always full. At first, my friend ordered the regular entree Orange Beef. After the first bite, she didn't like it and they took it back and got her the Honey Chicken without any issue. She liked the Honey Chicken much better. She also ordered the pan fried dumplings. She gets this every time and they are her favorite. I tried to talk her into ordering off the gluten free menu... but she said she wanted extra gluten on her food. She's funny.  Thanks to PF Changs for an excellent dining experience. We'll definitely be back soon.",

For our entrees I always get beef szechuan but I wanted something diffrent this time. So I went with the filet mignon. When I got the filet mignon with potatoes it looked great. But as soon as I put it in my mouth I spit it right back out. It was very rare and I was grossed out. The friendly waitress never asked me how I wanted it cooked and yes It might of been my fault cause  I didn't say how I wanted it cooked. Anyway, I told her to take it back and cook it more. I want it cooked well done when she brought it back it was medium rare but I didn't bother saying anything anymore.  My boyfriend got orange chicken and I thought it tasted like too much ginger but he didn't mind it. Lastly, bill was $75.  We were better off going to panda express. Btw, my dog really enjoyed the filet mignon.",

Had to flag down a server to request another glass of wine. Kitchen was backed up and this was a Wed night! Very disappointing dining experience!",

Then the valley grew and PF's popped up in three of the four corners and the heart grew another.  The food is good as it is at every location.    The service, what can I say...We were visited by at least three different people and with all three got that \"turn and burn\" feeling.   No real hospitality just generic all around service.  Sadly...PF Chang's has become the Applebee's of Chinese cuisine of Chinese cuisine.  I am not hating because Applebee's is good BUT PFCCB just doesn't have the magic it once had.",

The crispy shrimp was way over battered and the batter was \"gummy\" not crispy.  The Currry Chicken dish was like soup and very watery with hardly any flavor but heat from the chilis. The Pad Thai was super spicy, large raw carrot slices, HUGE tops of the scallions which were also raw and inedible, the peanuts where halved and not even chopped.  The Surf and Turf had two lobster pieces the size of a walnut which were salty and fishy, not sweet at all and the shrimp were measly, everything was tossed on the plate like someone did it blindfolded.  The hot and sour soup was good and that was it. We definitely won't be returning.",

Once her entree arrived it was full of chicken and ONE shrimp. We sent it back because she does not eat any poultry. 15 minutes later after our son and I were finished with our meals the server returned with my wife's entree. This time their was no chicken and what looked like 10 or so shrimp. However, the shrimp were still gray in color and obviously were cooked for less than 30 seconds. The waiter was embarrassed and took the plate away.  The manager came to the table and asked us to wait so they can try a 3rd time to prepare the entree properly. I told the manager, no and we will go home and I will cook my wife a nice meal at home. He then let me know that he will not charge me for the entree. As if he was doing us a favor for their errors and for 2 entrees that we never had a bite out of.  The server presented me with the check for $86 and was shocked that the manager did ZERO for us with no real apology or proper customer service by a manager. I asked the server for re-fills on my wife and sons non-alcoholic drinks and the server said NO FREE REFILLS, on the 2 non-alcoholic drinks. We will be sharing our 1 star experience throughout multiple media outlets.",

Not a huge fan of chain Chinese restaurants but decided to give their happy hour a try. No, we aren't cheap, but why go crazy spending money until you know if you're going to like what you're eating.  We started off a couple of beers, can't really messed that up. Decided to move on and try the lettuce wraps that everyone was talking about. We went with the vegetarian but it's wraps. The letters seemed to be the freshest thing on the plate. Additional Asian infused spaces with water chestnuts and a couple of other pre-frozen vegetables thrown in the mix. Sauce was decent but the overall mixture seem to lack freshness and freshness. 2/3  Next up work the crab Rangoon's. How can you mess these right? Seemed these have been sitting around for a while. The one time shall was frank perfectly. Golden brown and delicious. The inside seemed to be a pasty concoction of cream cheese and imitation crab meat. Not sure what happened but it just all seemed to merge together into paste. Gave these another 2/5.  We moved on to the pork dumplings and decided to get those steamed. Contest much of the pork feeling because of the thickness of the wrapper. Once again didn't seem too fresh. The rapper seemed a bit stale and tough.  Overall not one of the best experiences we've had food wise. Like I said service was perfect and the engine and helped us was exceptional. Just don't think will be going back even for happy hour specials.",

The food is consistently good, it's really well priced, the staff are warm and friendly, it's easy to park and I always feel very welcomed there. They pay attention to detail and don't rush your food like at some of the other restaurants.   Everything I have tried there is good, so don't be shy if you want to try something different, the soups are hearty & tasty, the appetizers are delicious and they have a good selection of entrees for whatever you are in the mood for.   I really like the decor and ambiance, it's got a great feel. You can sit at the bar and chat or cozy up with friends in a booth or if you have a large party make sure you book in advance and they will set up a large table setting for you for birthdays or celebrations etc.    If you like Asian Food, then Chang's is a great place to meet, hang out and eat super delicious and tasty food!!!",

    "text": "Haven't been to PFs in a while so my cousins and I decided to check it out over the weekend. This particular location is over in the District in Green Valley Ranch. The whole area preys upon dinners who want semi-upscale chain restaurants. I'm pretty sure the reason people even patronize PF Changs and the like is because they are expecting a uniform and consistent experience.  I know what to expect at Changs: glorified Panda Express at 3x the price, and if I had gotten that I would have been A-ok with it. Instead we got served up slop with a snooty attitude and terrible service. Our large party decided to order a few of the '2 for $40' Chang's feast specials. Pretty much you get soup, an app, entree and small dessert for two people for $40. Our party of eight told our server that we were doing the Changs Feast and his heart just sank. He probably wanted us to order a la carte to jack up the check, but after he took our orders he disappeared. We had to wave down bussers and other servers to simply get refills.  The food showed up in two waves, half the table got their food in a reasonable amount of time, the other half (including me!) had to wait another 20 minutes. The food that we did get was cold and we had to send it back and wait even longer. How the hell do you bring out undercooked Orange Peel Chicken? Its probably the most popular dish in the entire spot, y'all should be cooking it up in bulk considering how much of it you move on a busy day.   This is probably a great example of why I hate auto-grat. Way too many servers simply don't give a eff because they know they are getting their 18% and want to do the minimum.",

The manager came out, never introduced himself, seemed disingenuous while hearing my complaints. He got the fruit, making it seem like that was the only problem, and comped our entire meal. That's not what we were after. The waiter made it clear he was upset with us when he dropped off our fortune cookies and said \"that's it I guess.\" We left a tip and got out of there as fast as we could. I've worked in the food industry for years and know the only way to fix problems are to address them and that was my intention when asking for the manager.

Today was my best friends birthday and her boyfriend calls me 20 minutes before they leave to go have her bday dinner at this location and tells me he's planning on proposing to her. So I google the number real quick and a guy named Marcus answers and I tell him how they're coming in for her bday dinner but he's got a fortune cookie with the inside message saying will you marry me and I want to secretly come in so I can record it. Marcus took down my phone number, told me not to worry and called me after he seated them and then went on to tell me how he pulled the shade down on their booth so she wouldn't see me pull in, had me and my 3 year old wait where she wouldn't see us and offered us drinks, actually came out of the restaurant and got the fortune cookie from me so the server could deliver it to my best friend, told me when it was being delivered to her table, and also notified me when she was getting up to use the restroom in case my son decided to peek over and get us seen. The most amazing customer service I have EVER experienced in Las Vegas. He went above and beyond and then some on his own free will. Marcus, if you ever see this you are amazing and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my best friends engagement memorable!!!  If I ever decide to eat Chinese food I will come here but I will make sure to call and see if he's working he was just absolutely amazing.",

    "text": "BEST CHINESE FOOD IN LAS VEGAS.   Okay clearly that's not the case, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for the sodium laden dishes PF Changs has to offer.  I usually do take-out which will normally consist of the Changs Chicken Noodle Soup.   Full of pin-rice noodles, chicken, cilantro and tomatoes (and like 4 gallons of sodium), it's spicy and just what the doctor ordered on a cold night.   I actually order it no matter the weather but I imagine it's even better on the 3 cold nights we get here a year.  For appetizers I usually stick with the classic Salt and Pepper Calamari, but this last time we tried some new Edamame preparation they offer which had orange peels and chili flakes and found it fantastic.  The orange peels add a new taste to an old favorite.  We also had the crispy green beans which were nice yet un-extraordinary at once.    The bastards at corporate (presumably) recently removed my favorite entree from their regular menu, Dali chicken, so I've been doing some experimenting and the last two visits I tried items from their current Summer seasonal menu, the Thai Chiang Mai Curry Chicken Noodles and the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir Fry.   Those PF Changs cooks are masters of all Asian cuisines apparently.  The stir-fry was good, but not something I'd be devastated if it never came back once Summer ends.  The chicken was reminiscent of how Changs does most of their stir-fried chicken dishes, but just with different veggies mixed in and topped with a \"kimchi slaw\".  None of the flavors they tried to emulate really stood out to me which would be impossible if the kimchi was anything like traditional Korean kimchi.  Overall it was still tasty and I was able to finish it all.  I enjoyed the Chiang Mai Curry Noodles with Chicken a lot more.  I prefer the sliced chicken breast preparation of chicken over the other kinds at PF and that's what this features.  The broth is infused with coconut-curry and as a huge Thai-food fan, I was shocked how much it tasted like something I'd be happy with ordering at any of my favorite Thai restaurants in town.   I asked for it to be extra spicy and of course it didn't come close to matching the highest levels you can achieve at a more traditional Thai joint, it still did the trick and the mix of sweet from the coconut curry and spicy was that perfect balance I look for.   I'd definitely order this again.  I've always found the service, from the curbside takeout staff, to the hostesses, bartenders, and waitresses to be courteous.    4 stars, deal with it haters (and by haters I mean my blood pressure)",

    "text": "My family (wife, kids, and parents) and I have never been to P F Chang's and decided to try it out since most of our friends like it.  We really like Chinese food in San Francisco CA, but I decided to come without super high expectations.  Why the 2 stars?  It's a combination of reasons.  Even though I did not walk in with super high expectations there is still a certain par level for a restaurant that prices Chinese food that high and claims to \"create great, crave-able Chinese food that guests cannot get anywhere else.\"  What a claim!  So I guess you can say that I did have a level of expectation based on their own claim.    I ordered the shrimp with candied walnuts lunch plate with fried rice.   The flavor was really nothing extraordinary, it was rather bland.  The sauce was tangy and the melons sweet but the shrimp had no savor.  The shrimp was also chewy.  The fried rice was, how do you put it, fried rice.  The hot and sour soup, on the other hand, had great flavor.  It had just the right amount of sour and spiciness to it.   The rest of my family didn't have anything wonderful to say about their lunch dishes.  My wife had the Chang's spice chicken and my parents shared the wonton soup and Chang's chicken lettuce wraps.  The kids didn't complain about their dishes and they rarely rave about food anyways, so their reactions did not contribute to the rating in this review.  However the kids' food, and sauce that came with it, came out piping hot (it was too hot to handle with even our fingers).  My wife and I had to blow on their food for several minutes so that the temperature was palatable to their young sensitive mouths.  Mind you that we understand that food comes out hot at every restaurant but this time it seemed like the food was taken straight out of the fryer and sent directly to our kids. This event DID contribute to the rating in this review.    The service was ok... nothing great and nothing bad.  In conclusion, PF Chang's China Bistro did not create great, crave-able Chinese food that guests cannot get anywhere else.  They certainly did not create it with my shrimp dish nor the dishes that the rest of my family had.  This experience certainly does not scream \"lets go there again!\"  I often have a craving for Chinese food from a few other smaller restaurants in Henderson.  On top of that, they are inexpensive compared to PF Chang's.  We will not be coming back.",

What really exceeded my expectations was when we explained that our daughter had a peanut allergy, the manager came over to let us know that everything we ordered was being prepared in a complete separate area with fresh oil to make sure nothing gets contaminated with peanuts. All the food came out was delicious and served in round plates to know that it was allergen free. We will be coming back soon for sure!",

    "text": "Have to give one star to post, that's the only reason they are getting it. Went to dinner 6/4 , our server seemed to be having some issues with other staff, but did his best to keep upbeat while helping us. Our bill came to $ 54.00 and change. He gave us our bill, we generously tipped and left. To our surprise we receive an alert from our bank that we were overdraft. The server had used our card for another persons bill of over $ 250.00 ! Then ran our bill ! NEVER did he mention this to us, as he should have ! I'm of the belief that mistakes happen, but you fess up !! If he had told us about this we could have adjusted our $$ Now we have a $ 45.00 overdraft fee in addition to our meal which was not much more then the fee.   We called as soon as we got the alert and spoke to a young lady, who said she was the Asst Manager. She said that she could not resolve because of the time of night and would leave a note for the day manager to call us.  ** 6/5 Update ** I wish to thank the Chang day manager for his attention to this matter. He called a few hours after this posting. Along with his sincere apology, Chang is paying us back for the fees incurred in this error. After some extra hustle on our part the matter seems to be resolved. Thank you !   I am upgrading Chang to 4 stars due to the day mangers response to this issue. I am however being selfish and keeping one star for us because of the extra legwork we had to do on what was a rare night out.",

As soon as we sat down the bartender, Phil, immediately cleaned the area we decided to sit at. Phil was extremely busy but got our drink order very quickly. He was even kind enough to put our order in rift away so we could enjoy the happy hour.   We ordered lettuce wraps, hot and sour soup, and an order or springs rolls. Everything came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. We are until we were full.   The entire staff here was helping each other and so friendly.

We ordered several dishes to share with our family. The fried rice was not fully cooked. The steamed rice was not fully cooked either. We sat right by the window so we can see everything in the kitchen. We asked for cooked rice and brought the same uncooked rice to the table. The manager that was working the shift did not do anything for us. We will never go back to the PF Changs at green valley district... Be aware....",

Once I got there I was totally confused, there was only one sign directing you to the pickup area and after that you're on your own. I drove around twice until I decided to just park in front.   Now I don't usually order out a lot but I thought curbside pickup meant that you're order would be brought right out to your car. Nope not the case here. After 10 minutes I call and let them know I was there to pick up my order. The hostess rushes me off the phone saying \"I'll tell someone you're here,\" and hangs up the phone. Another 10 minutes go by and still nothing. I decide to go in and the hostess laughs it off and says \"Oh I told them you were here a while ago, just stand by the bar they'll get to you.\" Mind blown, I'm am more than over the situation at this point and I wait for my order to come. A few moments later it does and I get home only to find none of the condiments, plate settings and extras that I included in my order online are in my bag.  Overall the food was subpar and cold because of the extra 25 min wait time added because of their terrible service. I will gladly drive over to Planet Hollywood for my next PF Chang fix.",

They were delicious, but twenty minutes later we both quickly realized the effects of having eaten gluten...and now at 348 am we are both still up barfing away.   I have read great reviews from other locations of PF Changs that really honored and respected what a gluten free menu entails. Clearly the Henderson location doesn't respect or take that seriously.  If you are celiac or suffer from NonCeliac Gluten Sensitivity. BEWARE",

We had to send four utensils-plates back to the kitchen for being dirty and old food stuck on them.   The chicken lettuce wraps and handmade dumplings were very good. The white rice was old and dry,  Unfortunately the garlic noodles had more cucumber then anything else, they completely smothered the garlic noodles. Again the only saving grace was the server who offered to take it back and have it remade without the cucumbers.   We wanted to try something new and ordered sesame chicken, that tasted like it came out of a frozen bag. The chicken was dry and spongy.   Overall very disappointed with the food tonight.",

    "text": "Really PF Changs? You would allow your fast food version of you \" PEI WEI\" to be 100% better than your so called upscale chinese sit down dinning? Let first off say that I was warned about PF Changs not being as good as Pei Wei and of course I didnt listen. We decided to go here because it was a date night and we wanted to sit down and enjoy some good chinese food that wasn't take out. Oh how I wish we would have just went the other route.  Restaurant was pretty crowded but that's expected on a Friday night and totally understandable. The problem started with the fact that  our waiter wasnt sure if they had sparkling water because they may have ran out and then I could hear him tell the table next us that he wasn't sure if they had lemonade, come on shouldn't you know what you have and dont have?  Okay so we order mongolion beef and kung pao chicken which is what we always order from Pei Wei  and its always delicious. Not the case here, the kung pao chicken had barely any spice to it and the mongolion beef was so rubbery that the first two bites were spit out because they couldn't be chewed and so I let the waiter know that we were sending it back, he could have cared less and didn't even offer to make us something else which is poor service but honestly I know better then to send food back and order something else anyways.  We ended up sharing what was left of thr kung pao chicken and called it a night. We will not be returning to PF Changs and we will stick to what we know and just go chinese food is where its made right.... PEI WEI",

    "text": "Worst part about this meal was length of wait.  Took quite a long time for the waiter to greet us once seated and he was only prepared to take our drink orders. In total probably took close to 1.5 hours for lunch and we got there around 11:45 am [so not busy time]. We had been sitting outside long enough we already knew what we wanted to eat.  Ordered an ice-tea, had to remind the guy twice that I would like some sweetener with my tea..awesome.  I also just realized we NEVER GOT OUR SAUCES at all, like they didn't even make it to the table.  My co-worker wanted to start off w/ the salt n pepper calamari.  I would skip this. It was over-breaded and maybe undercooked? I think the oil they fried it is was not hot enough. It was missing the golden brown color you would typically expect from fried food, it was on the pale yellow side. And it was pretty greasy.  We didn't finish it.  Got huge salads [these were very good] I also asked for the dressing on the side, as well as,  the lime dressing on the side too [saw it was lower in calories on their nutrition facts]. Lime dressing never showed.  Ate the salad right up, maybe the best part of the meal.  I ordered the sweet n sour chicken, which on the nutritional info on their site says it's lower in calories and fat. It came out fried.  My co-worker ordered chicken n broccoli [a very healthy choice] it came out not fried. I think I would've preferred mine to be not fried chicken [it didn't say it was fried on the menu] and add more veggies.  They do have outside seating...so if this makes you happy, I'd sit outside order drinks and stick w/ 'safe appetizers' like the pot stickers or lettuce wraps.  I don't think I have to go back to this location.",

We were sat and after waiting 10 minutes we had to go ask the host for a server. When you sit down in a restaurant having a server is generally implied- but not for us. Then after a couple more minutes Anthony came over and was unapologetic and rude like we were such an inconvenience. Every time we asked for something he was bothered. My daughter tried ordering something that she hadn't realized was on the lunch menu and he was rude about that pointing to the word lunch as if she were just that dumb. When I asked if they could make her anything similar he just said no. He didn't try to offer any alternatives- just no. He seemed too be servicing tables around us but we may as well have had the plague! At the end of the meal we asked to speak with a manager, after a long wait, she came over and listened and offered to take off the two items that we didn't eat because nobody liked them. That's all she did, and then we waited another 15 minutes for a check!! It was insane and we felt complete unwelcome. Moral of the story- if you go don't sit in Anthony's section and don't look to the manager to do anything to help you out.",

My expectations for a place like PF Changs are minimal to begin with and after this experience I will never patronize such a place again. I reserved my sisters 40th birthday celebration including permission to arrive early to decorate as well as bring my own cake.   Upon arrival, the insightful and ignorant children at the hostess stand gave me a ditzy excuse of \"there's like people still eating and they haven't ordered yet so it will be a wait.\" I informed them that my reservation was for a special occasion and  had been arranged in advance. They agreed to take the dessert to the kitchen for storage and 20 minutes later than told provided me a table of 6 and advised that they would squeeze 8 chairs in to accommodate our reservation.  I took nearly an hour of asking for a server, then for drinks, then for menus, then for place settings before we were even able to enjoy a toast of the champagne I had pre-ordered. After hours of waiting and finally dining, the waiter arrives with a hideous plate of melted ice cream and candle barely standing up as a \"gift.\" I subsequently advised him of the dessert I had provided and was told that he wasn't informed. Ten minutes later he returned stating that the dessert I purchased and brought could not be located. Refer to above with the pathetically ignorant children staffing the hostess stand. After finally finding the desert, our server returned asking me how I would like the cupcakes plated and I requested on a plate with the candles that I provided. Dessert was delivered and ten minutes later I was again requesting plates and silverware in order to eat the dessert.   The service from the useless girls at the front to the end of the meal having to have requested every item menu to utensil was truly disappointing.   The manager provided us a free appetizer. When I arrange a special event and buy $87 bottles overpriced champagne, an apology and recognition of your faults would be far more than free edamame. The bartender is the only employee with any sense of service or wit. The manager and the rest of her staff are shameless and one could expect better from the dominoes down the street.   The kind bartender aside, you are each truly incompetent and awful. Take ownership of that.",

    "text": "Ok, yes everyone knows that this is not authentic Chinese Food- kind of along the same lines as Cheesecake Factory- a known chain restaurant- nicely decorated, with good eats (reliable for lettuce chicken wraps, mongolian beef, and lunch bowls, anyway). The only other exception is that there is a Happy Hour menu everyday.   We came here to celebrate Christmas Eve dinner with my father-in-law and his wife (my husband's step-mom). We had a reservation for 6 pm- although there were two parties ahead of us. The lobby was packed. We ended up getting a beeper and sitting at the bar- no smirnoff ice, no mango martini- those were my first choices, but I ended up getting a glass of merlot.   We requested a booth (there was one available BTW) on our reservation but got a table (Richie was the server)- we let him know and the manager was sent right over. She told us that unfortunately they can't hold the booths, and apologized, but as soon as the party (two senior ladies) behind us would leave the booth, we could have that one (we waited a half hour before getting the booth finally but had ordered in the mean time). Mid-appetizer (lettuce chicken wraps- could've used more lettuce leaves- and watch the water dripping off (a warning) & steamed pork dumplings- delicious), the party left- so we moved, and since we used the other server (the booth was his station), we were happy to finally get the booth. Kudos to the two servers (my husband tipped the initial server because he was sacrificing his table) and the manager for getting us the booth.   We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken in black bean sauce (I didn't get any beans in my portion- maybe dropped to the bottom of the serving plate), mongolian beef, and changs spicy chicken- family style. I wanted a dish with some vegetables but majority rule was against me- but my husband said it was not at all intentional (not counting the rice). I should mention that two small bowls of rice (one white, one brown) were also part of the entrees. The mongolian beef (very tasty), although not as spicy like in traditional chinese cooking (but I added some chili sauce on my plate)- everyone agreed on the beef. I liked the chicken in the black bean sauce better than the other chicken dish though. The portions on the entrees were small. The fried rice was huge in comparison.   The servers were all very good- taking plates away as soon as he noticed that we were done, and filling up the water glasses. He wrapped up the leftovers, presented us with fortune cookies, and left the check. We didn't want to linger (my father-in-law loves to talk afterward) as the restaurant was very busy. Our reason for coming here was to celebrate with dinner and walk across to the District to walk around (but the stores were all closed except the sports store and the restaurants).",

I requested \"extra hot\" and the server corrected my designation to something like \"spicy\" and it was great, added hot mustard, and red pepper sauce, excellent, my mouth is still burning.  We left with two large 2 go boxes.  Also had the chicken lettuce wrap, lots of chicken, it was a great opening to a delicious dinner.  4 total cocktails, and the above food, plus tip was around $85.  A little pricy but very high quality and excellent service.  We arrived around 5 on a Sunday, seated immediately, by the time we left close to 6, there was a packed house and a 15 to 20 minute wait.",

They took us to our table and a server took our order right away. I ordered chicken lettuce wrap, and my son had kids' fried rice.   My chicken lettuce wrap was shit! I couldn't even see and taste the chicken. There was too much water chestnuts. It was bland. The fried rice looked like poop. It was just rice smothered with soy sauce.  The server said he will come back to give us spoon, guess what? He never did.   Now, I know this is not authentic Chinese cuisine, it's some kind of fusion whatever, but fuck! At least do some research on what Asians really eat LOL   I'd rather eat at Panda Express than go back to this abomination.",

This particular location at the District in Henderson is the most mismanaged of any I've ever dined at. There is literally nobody keeping an eye on what's happening at the front of this restaurant. The kitchen seems good and the food is good, like the other locations but the service is the worst of the worst. I recently ate at Cracker Barrel and the service there was one hundred times better. If you want to have P.F. Changs go to one of their other three locations. They have managers there.",

From long wait times for our drinks we could literally see sitting in the service well, to receiving luke warm (almost cold) entrees...it's just always a shit show! The last time we went...was absolutely THE LAST TIME...because our appetizers came out w/our dinner AND I didn't even get what I ordered! AND we had no silverware! Our waiter was not attentive in the least. When we finally let the staff know we were not happy...they did offer us a dessert, to compensate? We respectfully declined. The whole experience was just \"blah\". It was literally so bad...we didn't even want to take home the leftovers for our dogs!!!   I never bothered to review this P.F. Chang's because I never planned to go back. But recently I've been seeing commercials for them. The marketing team does a great job making the food look so amazing on tv. But I guarantee you what they advertise will not be the service or meal you will receive at this location. And after 3 strikes I have no desire to give any other P.F. Chang's a chance either. Way too many awesome restaurants in LV / Henderson to throw good money after bad!",

    "text": "For years I've eaten at PFChangs once a week or more, I thought the food was quality and they had a hot mustard that gave it all a quality not usually found in chains. Over the last few weeks I have found the quality of the food has changed and the mustard I love has been replaced by the crap that usually comes out of a packet you rip open with your teeth. It has ruined one of my favorite dining spots. I asked management and was told they have new ownership. The nickel and dime savings will cost dollars as I and a few friends have already decided cheese cake factory will be our new Sunday dinner spot. Be aware when choosing you dinner spot that you are now in essence going to TGI Friday's at Chang prices. This is the problem with corporate culture. Save pennies and destroy years of reputation. Remember I told you. Good eating folks",

We will not return as other options for this experience are readily available. We have a favorite in Samurai Japanese Steak House.",

The food took forever to come out, and when it did, we got two bowls of rice with it.  Weird cause we ordered appetizers.  Then, some other server came over with lo mein and set it on our table saying it was a mistake for another table and free for us.  OK.  Weird again.  We had to flag our server down for re-fills, waited forever for our bill and again for him to run the cards.  Luckily we were not in a hurry or there would have been an even bigger issue.  The managers were nowhere to be seen and the hostesses were talking in a group at the front of the restaurant.  Shouldn't they be walking around helping?? It was a crazy debacle.

    "text": "P.F. Chang's. Probably the closest thing to an upscale Chinese chain restaurant that I know of, I've never been disappointed in the food, at least. I've found, however, that the service tends to vary depending on which one you go to -- and in this case, the relatively slow service was really the only thing that prevented me from fully enjoying my experience here.  Anyway, my mother and I came here for dinner and ended up taking advantage of the happy hour deals. Even when we sat in the bar area, it took a good ten or so minutes before we even got any attention -- that I attribute to the general lack of servers in the bar area. There was really only one person taking orders and busing for that part of the restaurant.  We ordered pork and shrimp dumplings, cauliflower tempura, calamari and vegetable tempura, crab wontons, and a large bowl of wonton soup to split since it was unseasonably cold at the time. Again, it took a while for our food to come out, but when it did come out it came out quickly, which we appreciated.  What we didn't appreciate was having empty and dirty plates piled up on our table as the food came out -- and with it being a small table, we felt rushed, like we had to finish eating everything quickly or we wouldn't have room for the next part of our order. Again, this is due to the lack of servers in the bar area -- please fix that, management? Please?  We also noticed that people who were in the bar area who ordered entrees were waiting upwards of 20-30 minutes before getting their orders -- which is much longer than you'd really want to wait for food, and why I'm glad that we took advantage of happy hour.  Afterwards we got dessert -- their good fortune cheesecake -- and even then we still had enough dirty plates on our table that we were concerned over having space for the mini dessert. You can even see that in the photos I have attached to this review.  While the food didn't disappoint, the service and the lack of servers where we ate detracted from our enjoyment of our meal. I'm hopeful that this will be remedied sooner rather than later, but until then I think I'll stick to my usual location in Town Square...",

The wait staff here is always friendly.  The food is consistently good and if reasonably good quality.  My most recent visit for lunch was tougher than usual - with the server bringing the incorrect food a few times.  Unfortunately, we were pressed for time and didn't complain - the food was still tasty, but just not exactly what we ordered.  However, based on multiple visits to this location- this is definitely not the norm!  Not the best Chinese in town - but it's good, and it's a great place to meet friends or do a business meeting!",

The wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which is served with spicy sichuan chili sauce, peanuts, green onion and red chili peppers. We also asked for some chili sauce to dip the chicken for some added heat 4/5. I ordered the Crispy Honey Shrimp which is battered and covered in a tangy honey sauce with green onions 4/5. Rice accompanies both entrees so we opted to have a mix of brown and white.  Nice attentive server quick to refill the waters and inquire how the meal was progressing. It's been some time since we came here for happy hour and now after seeing the menu and the new cocktail listing, I am sure we will be back soon to partake.  Enjoy the pics and come experience the Asian fusion yourself.",

It's 4pm on Monday New Years Eve and the place has no servers.  Let's see how long it takes to get a table for 2.   Update:  We did get a table after 15 minutes of waiting.  We were told by the hostess that they had no servers, but the moment we sat, 2 came by to ask us if we wanted to order within seconds (no chance to even open the menu)!  Maybe the management is not organized or maybe New Year's just threw them off.  Came for happy hour, had the lettuce wraps that people have raved to me about. I found them disappointing - dry chicken mixed with fried filler, not appealing to me.  However the shrimp dumplings are excellent!  Also very good are the spring rolls.  For Happy Hour, everything is around 6-7$.  I update my review to a 2 for the overall experience.",

I arrived at 6:30 and the hostess said it would be closer to 6:45 before the table is ready.  A party who had a reservation for 6:30 finally got seated around 7:05 and we did not get seated until 7:30....what's the pint of having a reservation if they are still going to make you wait 45 minutes to an hour for a table?  Our server Galyna was not able to handle all the tables she had.  Teamwork and helping each other out only exists for getting people seated then you are ignored.  We sat for a while before anyone came to take our drink orders, then when we ordered, she got our order wrong and brought dishes to the table we did not order.  Then my Neice had to get up and go ask someone for more to go containers because our server disappeared.  When the guy brought the containers my Neice asked him to let the manager know how poorly she treated us and how she never came back.  As for the Manager, he came by and apologized when we were still waiting to be seated however once seated, he never came back to check on us.  At the end of the meal I asked if they gave a military discount and not only did our server say no, she said, \"we gave you dishes you did not order which we did not charge you for so there is your discount\".  This place lacks in Management and Leadership and for a server to give me the response she gave me along with the lack of manager presence, is reason enough to not recommend this location.  They are always packed so this review will have little impact on how they do business and treat customers.  The hostesses though were amazing and clearly understood the frustration people had.",

We only had 30 mins until they closed so we called and were told if we were there in 5 mins then we would be seated. Obviously we obliged and to make it easier on our server and the kitchen, we ordered everything in one take! We ate family style and the food of course was delicious as always!   Our server David was amazing! We alerted him that we had a peanut allergy and he made sure to alert the kitchen of that as well as making sure nothing we ordered, other than the pad Thai, had peanuts. He knew the bar and shots pretty well and engaged in entertaining us in conversation. We mentioned when we sat that we were celebrating a birthday and wanted banana spring rolls for the table. He brought them out with a candle and a song! Even with it being closing time his customer service didn't reflect that it was. I mean, we all know those people who come in right before closing time, and although we were those people... We didn't want to be those people. Lol.",

Since it was his birthday, we ordered the great wall cake with a side of ice cream. AMAZING!!!! It was perfect to split between all of us.

The food is still of very high quality and although the portions are smaller than they once were, that is really not a bad thing.  Won ton soup and spring rolls are our favorite appetizers.   The soup was outstanding but could have been hotter.  The spring rolls were brought out right out of the fryer (as they should have been) and were great.  One thing that was different at this location was that the server did not serve the first cups of the won ton soup.  This was not a big deal, just different than we were used to-- this was with the large bowl order.     I have also been to the Summerlin location recently and noticed that at the Summerlin location, the sauce cups to be mixed to the diners' tastes are still brought to each table.  However, we were really surprised to see that the sauce cups are not used at this Henderson location, nor were we even asked if we would like the sauces.  We also did not notice any other table with the sauce cups.  PF Chang's no longer has the chicken with black bean sauce on the menu which used to be my husband's favorite.  He got the honey chicken which he really liked.  I had the chicken lettuce wraps for my entree which were of course excellent although the dish was not as hot as it should have been.  The atmosphere is really nice and we enjoyed our meal.  Our server was Andrew and he did a good job-- the only disappointment was that he took way too long to bring my husband a second cup of coffee which was requested before dessert arrived and was not brought to the table until after dessert was finished.  For dessert my husband chose the apple cobbler and I asked for the deconstructed berry shortcake.   A suggestion for PF Chang's would be to serve your desserts in the dishes and in the format as is pictured on your menu.  It is very disappointing to get something completely different looking than what you were expecting, although once we tried the desserts, we were happy with them.  About the coffee - my husband thought it was excellent (rich dark roast); however, the first cup was not hot enough and he enjoyed the second cup which was nice and hot, more than the first.  On our way out, we both stopped in the restrooms.  I was highly disappointed and disgusted with the state of the women's restroom.  The toilet looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks; the restroom in general was dirty and looked in need of repair and regular maintenance.  I have never been in a PF Chang's restroom that was filthy, ever, before this one.  I don't know that we will go back to this location.",

You have to tell him what you want a minimum of 3 times before he actually gets it.  Pretty inefficient and just struts around trying to figure out what he needs to do.  I've never seen him do any prep work like the others and there is no interaction with the customers.  I'm sorry, Changs, this ones a miss.",

The food was fresh and they add a good amount of shrimp & chicken. Their fried rice is also very good. A lot of restaurants give you the worst bag for your takeout, but not PF Changs! A sturdy paper bag with handles is more than appreciated. One negative may be the parking. Their lot was pretty full, and there's a sign that directs you to additional parking across the street. The restaurant does, however, have designated spaces for takeout and you can use their curbside pickup!  I do not use that, it seems cheesy. Parking at The District can be tricky, so keep that in mind.",

The waiter came to out table within 5 minutes, took our drink orders, our appetizer orders and our dinner orders. We got our drinks and appetizers within a few minutes. One and a half hours later, we still had not gotten our dinner! In this period of time, the waiter never came to our table! We had to flag him down to refill our drinks. I finally approached the hostess at the front door and told her our problem and she said she would send the manager over. Ten minutes later, another person in our party asked the hostess again if we could talk to the manager. Finally the manager came over and we told her it had been an hour and a half and we still had no dinner.  She apologized and said it was out if her hands! What???? You are the manager, how could this problem be out of your hands?  We adked for the check for our drinks and appetizers because we were leaving.  She said she would not give us a check and again apologized. No offer of perhaps a dessert on the house even!  We left and went to another nearby restautant where we were seated and served within 20 minutes. We have always enjoyed PF Changs in the past but because of this unpleasant episode we will never go there again! The waiter and so called management are unqualified and do not handle problems correctly! Stay away!!!",

Not only did they lose out on a substantial order they also humiliated me. I alway enjoy this restaurant, however if that's how they treat people with special needs we won't go back.

It took them 45minutes to seat us, another 45minutes for the food and every dish was loaded with salt. We ordered 1 app, 1 soup and 2 entrees and every dish was salty to the point where it was really not edible. We could even taste the saltiness on a spicy dish, super salty. We ended up leaving with a hungry stomach. Does the chef not taste the food before it goes out? Honestly, some of the small Chinese takeout places are so much better than P.F. Chang's. I don't understand how could people eat at this place. Do they not have any taste buds? Or does their regular customers just love salt in general? Eating here is like putting a spoonful of salt in your mouth. I will never eat here again. I have given them enough chances. If I could give them negative ratings I would have.",

As we walked past PF Changs I could smell what they were cooking and I said \"Hey, it smells pretty good\". After walking around looking at the shops for awhile we decided to head back over by PF Changs to eat.   We walked in and one of the hosts rolls her eyes at me! Then another hosts gives us some waiting tool thing and we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes. The hosts seemed to be laughing and joking around in front of people, which gave me the impression that this place tried too hard with their decorations, dimmed lights and lit candle at each table, but hired young people who didn't have any professional demeanor!    We sat at our table and our waiter came up and asked us what we wanted to drink.Then after 15-20 minutes he comes back and takes our order, I order the orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered some beef  (I forgot the name). The orange chicken tasted like Dawn dish washing soap, and the beef tasted way too strong. My boyfriend said the taste was stuck in his mouth and he tried to wash it down with Coca-cola, that didn't work, then we took a quick drive to Walmart to get him some mouthwash cause he couldn't stand it, The whole travel size bottle of mouth wash didn't get the taste out of his mouth even!!!!!!! Then we got some ice cream, and that sort of helped, but the taste came back and he had to go home to brush his teeth like three times, the taste was still there the next morning, and he had to repeat the process! This was the worst experience i've ever had at a restaurant. Me or my boyfriend won't ever go back!",

However, worst of all was my fiance's sweet and sour chicken.  I don't know what happened this time (we've ordered it before and know what it usually tastes like), but it was like someone dumped a shaker of thyme in the sauce.  It was so strong that I took one bite and my mouth STILL tastes gritty.  My poor sweetie just kinda sat there and sadly stared at his plate.    I really don't think we'll be back.  Grand China in Henderson is far superior and is very close to our house.  I don't really see why I would return to a restaurant where I pay so much and get so little in return.  Not a fan.",

The reason I'm just giving it a \"Meh\" is because of the wait time...although we had a reservation, it didn't matter. I notice in other restaurants there's usually a \"reserved\" sign on the table. Wondering if it might work for PF Chang's?  The staff was nice, food was good especially the cumin lamb, but the wait time was super irritating. Noticed other parties who had reservations waited a long time. At least the small parties could sit at the bar.   Would I return? Only if my parents really wanted to visit again.",

Firstly, I called to reserve for a party of 18 and when we got there, the table setting was only for 12. Secondly, I was the first to order out of 18 people and ordered dumplings as appetizers - those came 45 mins later. Thirdly, when we were trying to get the attention of our server (her name is Bri), she just kept ignoring us and was not accommodating at all. Finally, when we ordered a \"surprise\" Great Wall of Chocolate for my sister's birthday, it didn't take her five minutes before she went up to my sister, told her \"you didn't tell me it was your birthday!\" and asked her for the dessert that she would like to order - after I'd ordered something specific.",

I ordered the Singapore noodles the dish was extremely salty, i literally tried to swallow it but i ended up spiting into my napkin. I then ordered the Mongolian beef, its wasn't good either.... The pad thai was okay but not good. Everything taste super sweet and just bad. Panda express is americanized too but it taste 100 times better then this crap. I will stick to going to china town for food, the only reason i came here any way was because i had a gift card. Our waitress however was very nice and sweet. She deserves 5 starts. Everything else deserves no stars. Never will be back again this place is just really bad, ive never been more disappointed and disgusted",

Since we were there with family and wanted a quieter spot she then put us in the corner.  Of course the music playing, we were right under a speaker.  This made it difficult for us to converse especially when you have someone with a health condition that makes it difficult for them to talk and talk above the noise.  During the meal we asked if they could turn the volume down and the waiter said he told the manager but we couldn't hear any difference.   PF Changs is your basic starter Chinese restaurant.  Food was filling enough and the waiter was pleasant and prompt.  Not sure if I would come back.....",

Or maybe it was just our waiter, I will give the restaurant the being it of the doubt and say it is just the one waiter. I am going to also give the waiter the benefit of the doubt and not say his name even though I really want to (he he) but we are adults so I will not, nay!! Shan't not haha.   Anyway so we sat down and the guy was just rude from the start which was fine maybe it was just an isolated incident but oh no not even close. He takes our drink order and as we wait I am looking at the menu and my most favorite dish wasn't on the menu!! So he comes back with our drinks (I got a pot of hot tea) and I ask about the menu item in question he says that no it's not but they will still make it for me so that was really awesome. We said we needed another minute but that I would like some sugar. Without even acknowledging the fact that we said anything to him he just walks away! And just to put the rest of the meal into perspective for you he did this every time we said or ask him anything. So he comes back to take our food order and he never brought me my sugar. I probably sound like a crotchety bitch but I'm sorry I'm not down for paying good money to come eat at your place of work and you treat me like I am an inconvenience of some sort.   The only reason they are even getting 3 stars is because gosh darn I love there food, it is so delicious every time  and it doesn't treat me like I don't exist lmao. The only reason they lose 2 stars is for that crappy waiter!!! Honestly he was really bad, my boyfriend and I just started laughing about it because he basically took his potentially bomb diggity tip and tossed that shizz straight out tha winda.   Basically go eat here it is worth it and the food is o'mazing just pray you don't get helped by he who must not be named",

    "text": "I generally like PF Changs food, but the service at this location has been poor on too many occasions to warrant more than 3 stars.  For example yesterday I went in for lunch (party of 2) and while we were seated in the half-full restaurant right away we never, ever saw our server.  After I warmed up two seats- the first was under an air duct so I switched to the other side of our table- and both of us had picked out what we'd like for an our entrees, along with the lettuce wraps as an app, we still hadn't had a server acknowledge our existence, let alone take a drink order.  We gave him/her another two minutes, and then left.  This isn't the first time I've had really slow service here, but it is the first time I've walked out of the place.  With that said, I generally get the lettuce wraps here- but ask for extra lettuce if you need it instead of cramming everything in the few they give you (other locations I've been to have their servers do this automatically- after all lettuce is cheap!), and they have a pretty large gluten free section for anyone in your party with wheat allergies.",

I have to say they take that very very serious and I'm truly amazed by that, Brittany our server made sure to bring us the list of what is safe for him to eat and she even checked with the chef and put an alert on the order. When they brought his food out it was in a completely different plate and it came with a specific server to only address the allergies. I'm so impressed by Brittany our server and the entire staff at this location I got to give them an A+ for that. I will for sure continue to go to this location and ask for Brittany as well.  Thanks P.F. Chang's for taking allergies so serious! Wish more places would be this way!",

    "text": "We come to this location frequently for both take-away and dine-in due to its convenient location- proximity to 215, our home, and to the GVR movie theater.  We decided to go low key this New Year's Eve with dinner and a movie.  I made a reservation in advance, but due to the volume of people in the restaurant, we had to wait about 10 minutes.  Way better than the 60-75 minute wait being quoted to walk-ins.    After we were seated we were greeted promptly.  I have never seen so many staff in Chang's before.  I think they were trying to turn tables as fast as possible.    We started with a couple of delicious Bud Lights ($4 each, not bad).  Since we perused the menu while waiting, we had already decided on the 4 course prix - fixe menu for $39.95.  I started with egg drop, he started with hot and sour.  Both standard and good.  Next on to the Lettuce Wraps.  Always a favorite.  They were crunchy and fresh.   I added a bit of the spicy sauce they whipped up at the table.  Delicious, but why do I always run out of lettuce?!  For entrees we went with Beef Lo Mein and Chang's Spicy Chicken.  I also ordered a pot of tea.  Lo Mein- The noodles were tender and the beef crispy and the Lo Mein sauce was flavorful.  I do think it was a little light on meat this time.  Chang's Chicken- while spicy is in the name, the dish is not very spicy, however it is very good.  The all white meat chicken was tender and seasoned well.  We did feel a little rushed during this visit...our lettuce wraps came out before we even started our soup.  But given the holiday, I understood.  Plus, we were able to get to the earlier showing of Unbroken, so it worked out okay.",

What made the meal so special was the fantastic service we received from Lawrence, he was unbelievable, took orders from 11 People and did not write anything down, he memorized everyone's orders for not only drinks but for the entire dinner.  What a pleasant and friendly man . Lawrence is a great asset to this restaurant, I hope management is aware of his expertise. Thank you Lawrence for adding so much to our evening.   The five star rating is because of You.",

My only complaint was that the restaurant was not as clean as it use to be. Last time there was about one year ago. We were seated and there were crumbs on our chairs from the previous group, and the floor was quite dirty as well. Of course I will go back because of the food and service but I wish it was a little more kept up as far as cleanliness in general.  Thanks Anthony for awesome service.  Rosalie",

After 3 bottles of wine, and 2 hours of drunk painting, we needed food!   They took our party of 6 in despite the fact that they were closing in 15 minutes. I was fearing that the waiter would give us bad vibes and attitude for keeping him after closing time but to my surprise he was extremely pleasant. David knew the menu well and even went out of his way to find a drink that tasted similar to what we wanted to order since they did not carry a liquor we needed to make the shot.  Food at PF Changs is always the same despite the location so it's hard to write a review on the food but when good service is given it is important to acknowledge it. David was kind, efficient, personable and hardworking. He dealt with our wild group of 6 well and I appreciate him for the great experience.",

    "text": "Great happy hour, the tacos and fried cauliflower are awesome . Haven't tried the chicken wings yet and they were sold out last time but they sound great and the price is nice.  Nice ambiance outside and in lounge area.  Their Moscow mule, my personal favorite, is made with house made ginger beer but is still just average as far as mules go.  Fried rice, lettuce cups are awesome.  I look forward to going back after not being there for a long time.   Now the staff... the closing bartender is a cool guy, really seems to care even when we came in 15 before close.   On the other hand , out last experience we had a blond server who was just ok... very slow to put food in, seemed more interested in floating around aimlessly.. also was extremely clueless when it came to my girl's strict dietary needs ( she's vegan and gluten intolerant , among other things ). But when her food came out screwed up the blond server didn't really seem to care but she did get it fixed.. check time was when she really screwed up.   We went for happy hour but because she took her sweet time ringing in our drinks and food most of it didn't go in under happy hour so we were overcharged about 25$... also to add tofu is More expensive than adding chicken (?!?!?!) when questioned, the server did fix the bill but passive aggressively blamed it on us... then corrected my girl about the tofu price (\" for future reference \") seeing as how I've been a chef for 13 years and my girl had been in the front of the house ) including P.F. Chang's back in the day) the way this woman handled herself and through in that little shot pissed me off and was also very impolite and rather rude.. she is in major need of some restaurant etiquette classes.  I hope she is never our server again, and if by chance she is, I will request someone else, to her face.      But overall, good food, good happy hour, lots of selection in the main menu section, and nice romantic ambiance at night.  Staff does need a little more practice with dietary restricted guests and the kitchen manager ( since they most likely don't have a chef) needs to get off his lazy bum and be willing to make simple substitutions.. nothing crazy but they won't even sub sauces or much else to make more food available for those with restrictions... when it can easily be done by anyone with half a brain.  I will definitely go back, I I hope In the meantime they learn how to make a proper spicy tuna mix instead of the bland junk they serve now.",

    "text": "I gave this location one star because I couldn't give zero stars. From the moment we walked in our experience was less than desirable. We (a party of two) walked to the hostess stand and the girl immediately picked up the phone, essentially ignoring us. She very easily could have greeted us, excused herself to answer the phone and put them on hold to finish helping us.  Another hostess seated us rather quickly as it 8pm on Saturday night and the restaurant was not busy. It took our waitress 10 minutes to speak to us for the first time. She apologized for the wait and took our drink, appetizer and entree order at the same time. She said she would expedite our order because of the wait. She brought our drink order out which was incorrect. Our app came out pretty quickly but we couldn't start eating because we weren't given plates, utensils or a napkin. We had to ask for those after the runner came back a second time. Our entrees finally came out at 8:40. When our waitress came to check on us a few minutes later, we joked to each other that we should've asked for the bill then because we weren't going to see her again. Unfortunately, we were right. It was now nearing 9pm and our waitress was nowhere to be found. We asked another waiter to see if he could find her for us. After about 5-7? minutes we decided to go find the manager and pay that way. Before we went to get up, our waitress came out and we asked for the check. We were going to pay with a credit card but at that point, we wanted to get out of there and figured it would take another 10 minutes to get the bill back so we paid with cash. On our way out, we asked to speak with the manager. The hostess didn't know where they were, went to look for them and then informed us he would be out. After another 5-7? minutes, the manager never came out so we left telling the hostess never mind and we wouldn't be back. She said \"ok.\"we definitely won't be returning to this location.",

That was the highlight of this visit. 10 empty tables in our section..waiter obviously had TOO MANY TABLES ! Poor guy tried hard..but .. Waited 10 minutes for acknowledging our existence.. Then 10 more minutes for drinks.. After 40 minutes our food FINALLY arrived.. FAIL !!! New pad Thai chicken --what a dissapointmen ! Extremely spicy..rubbery noodles..  Oh and no drink refills..it has been 1 hour now..still waiting for the food to be made correctly... So 20 minutes passed and the food finally came out so we asked for it to go.. And then asked for the check.. Well when the check came they billed us for two orders of the pad thai so I ask for the manager. Waited 10 more minutes and then BRIAN Came out to see us.. And then he said so don't worry we're not going to charge you for the second one and then I asked him why what he charges for the second one when it is a refire of the first one I could not even eat... I am so over this place and the complete lack of competence in the management stats in the ignorant answers that he gave us as excuses for why the evening went so badly.. Now I understand the bad reviews that I have read about this place so if you have a choice.. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !!",

Finally got it n got home it was the food we ordered but everything was cold, really after waiting all that time the food was cold n we only live about 9 min from the restaurant. Too many choices in town to accept this type of service. If they want to create a bad experience they should at least reduce their prices. So frustrated, moving on.

This is the 2nd time this has happened st this location ,  so I will not be returning until they are fixed. It's about customer service and experience, so make sure customers are not sitting on old , cracked , worn out leather seating. I did look at 3 other booths and they were just as bad if not worse.

We flagged the manager down and and asked if he could please find out waiter ( obviously a sign of trouble ) and the manger didn't offer to ask why or check back to check on us.

He was very distracted.    I ordered a glass of their 'Moscato' to start.  I put that in quotes because it really wasn't Moscato.  I don't know if they mixed up their wines but it was more of a Riesling if anything else.  I didn't finish it.  For my meal I wanted to try their Ma Po Tofu.  This dish was crispy silken tofu tossed in garlic red chili sauce over broccoli.  Again I was unimpressed.  The lack of the nearly flavorless sauce used was the downfall.  The only good thing about the entree was the steamed broccoli.    I guess I know why there were so many open tables on a Saturday night.  Very disappointed.",

We never used pf changs curb side order but since today is Christmas eve we thought  we order out and invite friends over for dinner.  So we order online at around noon for 550pm pick up.  We got there early, 540pm, just to give them extra time.  We did not get our food until 632pm only after my wife spoke to the manager.  BEWARE!!They cannot handle the holiday traffic...  Look for other options... I will try and upload pictures of the receipt with the time and the tickets from the kitchen.   Idk of the times on the tickets from the kitchen are when the order was placed or when the food was checked out.",

They didn't charge us for the soup, or salmon, and threw in free desserts. Too little too late.",

So maybe PF's needs to do a better job of explaining themselves?   The steamed potstickers with shrimp are super yummy. The mongolian beef is good, but a little greasy (especially if you heat it up the next day), Their fried rice is tasty and whether I've eaten in or gotten take-out, the service has been really good and the food consistent in looks and flavor.  Maybe I'm also getting lucky and not ordering their freezer entrees? I'm sad others had such bad experiences, but it won't stop me from going back.",

I'm a fan of good won ton soup being from a major city and this was a 2 on a scale from 1 to 10 for taste. The food was not memorable and neither was the service.

Our server Nate was at our table in just a couple minutes to take our drink orders & we took the opportunity to order an appetizer. The drinks flew to our table and the appetizer was shot out of a cannon, both were at our table in maybe 5 minutes, probably less. Nate came by to check on us at least 2 times before we narrowed down our entrees. The entrees were out within a reasonable time (maybe 20-25 minutes) and piping hot. DELICIOUS! Nate again checked on our table another 2 or 3 times before we were finished. He was such a joy & really made our dinning experience even more special. Thanks Nate! We will be returning soon.",

I had the hot and sour soup to start which was a nice start, chicken lettuce wraps were delicious, the crispy honey chicken was cooked very well and the banana spring rolls for dessert has become one of my favors dishes. The reason for the two star review is because of the service which was horrible. It took us about and hour and a half to complete our meal and this is because the waiter that attended to our table to put it lightly couldn't have cared any less about pretending to want to be there. If we wanted a drink we had to wait, every dish took forever to come out and it being a thurs night with a very limited amount of patrons it didn't seem to make sense what was taking so long. The restaurant used to be a nice place for a night out,  a date something of that sort, but it's completely lost its gusto. I would compare it to a little bit nicer than Chilis when before I held PF Changs to a higher standard. I guess the more corporate you become, the less you care about what takes place in your restaurant and it clearly shows",

When I am made to go to these places I try to look at the positive side and take it as an insightful social experiment. I submit to Yelp my field report (with help from my Grandma):  1. Grandma: \"Oh, I bet this tastes just like it does in China.\" No, Grandma it doesnt, unless the main ingredient in all their sauces is also high fructose corn sugar. Why does everything here have to be so sweet and offensively created for \"the American palette?\"  2. Grandma: \"Ohhhh, Angelllaa, that drink looks good.\" Yes, it LOOKS good (+1 for fruffy garnishes), but wouldnt it be better with the correct amount of alcohol in it?  3. Grandma: \"What a nice young man.\" Five seconds after this comment our server was complaining (within earshot) about having to repeat everything to my near-deaf Grandma. He is not a nice young man, Grandma!  4. Our bill mysteriously had an extra alcoholic drink added. Server: \"Ohhh, oops! Howd that get there?!\" Trust me buddy, it would have gone a lot better if I had had that extra drink.",

The hostesses seemed put out that we had come in and placed us at the worst possible table, right at the entrance, although there were plenty of empty tables.  It took almost 20 minutes for our waiter to show up and take our orders, and another 10 minutes to get us some water.    I had the Schezuan Beef, which was good and spicy, but I only had a single drink to last me the whole dinner since after our food came out he was MIA.  Even after our food was clearly done with plates stacked it took an additional 15 minutes for him to give us our bill.  I felt like there was no respect for my time and little care for what experience I had.  There are other places to waste your money.",

    "text": "If you eat here be sure to bring cash.  I treated myself to a moms night out and I was told that the card reader wasn't working so, if I could sign an old fashioned paper receipt machine like they used in the \"I love lucy\" days (charge o plate),  I agreed, then found that they charged me for an order twice as much as I payed for. When I called the manager (aka the run around) she told me that the used my \"friend'\" card.  I was there alone, why what she trying to insist that I was in the wrong and some how trying to take advantage of them.  She was hostile and rude.  She insisted that she would have to speak to her manager.  Then when I called back they said they refunded the money to my card already. (what happened to the manager)  I had obviously checked my account and it was not credited so I had them double check the card number.  Sure enough they refunded to the WRONG card number, and was very hostile and rude about THEIR mistake.  So finally after she saw for herself they had made their she finally reversed the charge.  Trying to make it seem like they did me a huge favor.  It was a good thing I check my account daily.  I wonder if the others who were affected by this transaction are even aware that there was an error.  I am writing mostly about the unprofessional and rude behavior when I transaction error has occurred.  People use their checking accounts for multiple transactions, including, rent, mortgages, car payments. PF Changs needs to be more careful, and apologetic.  Be very careful and keep your receipt.  That was a life saver.  They asked me for it every time.  The food wasn't even that great.",

    "text": "PF Changs is always a good fall back for me. They menu is pretty typical- standard chinese food fare, really no surprises. To be perfectly honest- the service has always been pretty slow, so I stand by ordering take-out. This is FAST, and the only way I go PFC. I ALWAYS order the Ma Po Tofu. I am not a vegetarian- I could never swing that way, however this is my all time favorite dish from this established chain! The tofu is silky and melts in your mouth. It's dressed with a slightly spicy sauce that sings with garlic! Served aside a mountain of broccoli- I am sure that I am doing good things for my body when I eat..... lets be honest, devour this dish! Even if you aren't a tofu fan, I encourage you to give this dish a try, it changed my mind!",

    "text": "Stopped in last night for happy hour on our way to a movie. We went straight to the bar. Been here about 5 times in the last 6 months or so, always for HH and have never been greeted by the hostesses. It's funny too, because there is always 2 of them standing there, usually talking to each other. Last night I commented, oh yeah, the service here sucks. Oh well, we continued to the bar and found a seat. It was about 5:30. Happy hour ends at 6:00 so we had plenty of time to get an order in. We sat for a few minutes and still not acknowledged so the husband went back to the hostesses and picked up a menu from their station, while they were standing there. The waiter we had, however, was very prompt to take our order and bring the food and check on us several times. He gets 5 stars for his service. For the food: it's always consistently on the money. And the HH deals are great. We get the lettuce wraps (my fave), spring rolls, the ribs with the dry rub (they are fantastic), dumplings and the green beans.  Everything is fresh and tasty. After the meal, we left, walking right by the hostess station without a peep from either one of them. I really wonder if they are trained that way because I've never seen them any other way. If not for the hostesses, I would give it 5 stars.",

I was a little stunned at how busy it was and having to wait about 45 minutes for a table and it was pretty crowded. We were sat at a tiny table for two which ordinarily fine however with the plates and sauces that they serve there was barely room to eat. The wait staff was amazing and the food was the best! We went again for my birthday this year and the experience was even better. We got a booth this time and plenty of room for everything. It can be a little pricey but if your looking for a great romantic dinner with amazing food, this is the place :)",

After waiting an hour because the restaurant was short staffed in the kitchen I finally get my food and it looks like _____! I asked for the manager twice and 10 minutes later he comes to the table and tells me that is Chang Chicken. I eat Chang's Chicken all the time and it was not Chang's Chicken it was some crap they cooked back in the kitchen under the wonderful supervision (sarcasm again) of James. I know why the food sucked and they were disorganized tonight it was because James was leading (sarcasm again) the crew. It will be a while before I revisit this PF Chang's or any PF Chang's. Thank you for screwing up my wives birthday dinner James. Call before you go, if James is managing don't waste your time!",

Is it a $$$$ Celebrity Chef owned restaurant on the strip? No but the food is good with good value and the service is fantastic. We had the Flaming Red Wontons, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Salt and Pepper Prawns, S&S Pork and Sizzling Asparagus. I asked about the SP Prawns before I ordered them and the server gave me a quick description and said they were really good. She was right! They were excellent, perfectly prepared and tasty. She recommend the Flaming Wontons again nice dish with a kick to it. My wife only had one because of the extra kick but hey more for me. We went at 8pm on a Saturday night and waited maybe 15 minutes....no biggie time for a Sam Adams at the bar. Our servers were Brandy and Brandon. They were super attentive and never missed a beat. She new the menu made smart recommendations and was very nice. In all honesty it is a 4 star restaurant but they need a little help to get back up where they deserve to be.",

My husband and I have now been quite a few times and have tried many of the items.  My favorite would have to be the well known Chicken Lettuce Wraps. You can never go wrong with those and even better when they are at the cheaper happy hour price.  I enjoy the selection of street tacos that they have to offer, my favorite being the Mahi Mahi tacos.  They are served in twos and actually have two pretty substantial pieces of fish on each.  I was happy to see their Crab Wontons (which actually have a good amount of crab in them-unlike some places)  made it onto the happy hour menu as well. Probably my most notable find was the Coconut Lemon Sour on the cocktail menu. Not too sour, not too sweet and perfect for the hot Vegas summers.  On a non food note, this location added some additional booth seating to the middle of their dining area instead of tables and chairs. My party and I found them be much more comfortable then the previous set up.",

Ok, no biggie, called back to ask, was left on hold for 7 minutes. I decided to drive down there And do a curbside pickup. 35 minutes later I was still waiting in my car. I called from my car again, I was told they were going to inform someone I was waiting. Still nothing. I went in, and waited for another 20 minutes, i was told they were going to check on my order, no follow up, nothing. I left after an hour.. Waste of my precious time.

They have gluten-free menus & vegetarian/vegan menus but the two do not combine unless you just want rice & a side of steamed veggies which was not what I had hoped for. Eventually the server had a manager out who then got the chef out & he cane up with a great tasting tofu dish. Meanwhile the rest of the large party had already finished their food & I had to try a few bites of my dish & get it packed to go since I had an appointment to get to. Fried tofu always tastes best fresh. But it was very good. I appreciate that the chef did come out to discuss the options & then make something special, Wish it hadn't taken the server so long to get others involved. This could really be resolved by having just one entree on the menu, but most of the sauces are pre-made which is why I couldn't get the tofu lettuce wraps.",
