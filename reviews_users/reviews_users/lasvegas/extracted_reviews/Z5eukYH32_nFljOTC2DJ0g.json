    "text": "Ordered a large mushroom pizza over the phone.  Order taker repeated it back.  20 minutes to pick up.  I arrived to a completely full parking lot, some would say is a good sign. At the end of the bar is where you pick up the take out orders.  I received prompt attention and noticed the pizza in the box was a small.  The bartender offered to throw in a drink to make it up, or make a new pizza.  I let it go, the small was big enough.  Got it home. Wow! a crispy, cracker-like crust.  Slices of excellent mozzarella left no greasy pools.  The tomato sauce was properly applied.  A bit extra basil made this a terrific mushroom pizza.  I will go here again, for sure.  Probably for lunch, when I hope it won't be so crowded.",

    "text": "Pizza pizza!  From service to food to atmosphere, this pizza joint is simply the perfect way to end the work week in LV.   Food: Pizzas definitely belong in coal brick-ovens!   -Pizza: Crunchy smokey thin crust pizza with delicious fresh mozzarella. The topping choices are endless. We went with sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, extra basil, and mushrooms. Since the large size was only $2 more than the small size, we got the large and ate pizza all weekend. ;)   -Caesar Salad: I love Caesar salads. I order them everywhere I go. This one was perfect. Fresh romaine. Shredded parmesan. Smokey croutons. Tangy creamy Caesar dressing. Portions are huge. Small salad was more than enough for two.   -House Salad: Felt like we made a trip to the Mediterranean salad bar. Tomatoes, roasted red pepper, mushrooms, olives in vinaigrette dressing. Not bad. -Beer: Blue Moon or Stella on tap go oh so well with pizza. Don't get the house wines, they're not very good.  Service: We've sat at both the tables and the bar. Service is stellar either way. Waiters/bartenders are friendly. Food comes out fast. They check in with us just enough. What more can you ask for?  Atmosphere: This restaurant is especially great on a warm summer evening with a big outdoor patio. The bar is also a great place to watch the game.   Parking: The only knock against this place is that the parking lot in this plaza sucks. Half the lot is reserved by Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Lame. So as soon as you pull into the lot, keep an eye out for parking.",

I am not a fan of places that have a base price for the food that's already pricey and then charge additional $1-2 for each topping.  The pizza though is good; once you eat good pizza, it's hard to go back to crap like Little Caesar's.  (Although LC's and $5 pizzas got me through law school.)      Customer service is excellent, much better than Settebello.  Overall, I'm a fan but find it's a \"once in awhile\" outing.",

    "text": "The name \"New York Pizza\" conjures up a predictable image in the heads of most people, and to those lucky enough, an intense and blissful memory.  This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.    But there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.  I've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.    We were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.  They don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isn't very \"East Coast\" of them, but that's one part of back home that I don't miss. Five mother-f'n stars.",

I definitely recommend the made-in-house fried mozzarella, it was the best I've ever tasted and I am very picky with my mozzarella sticks... My only complaint is that the marinara had green peppers in it and that's not one of my favorite flavors... The linguine with clams was to die for... The sauce was sooo yummy, perfect kick to it, not too spicy, very flavorful and lively. It was so good I drank it like a soup after I finished my perfectly cooked pasta! Craft beer on tap, delightful gelato... Everything made fresh to order in-house... It's like eating at a real Italian family's house! I'm in heaven and I'll be back",

I have traveled extensively thru Italy and Spain and as a kid my parents owned a pizza joint. I feel like I have a pretty good palate for picking a winner. Which brings us to Grimaldi's Las Vegas. I have visited this location a handful of times and only today realized that I really like this place. As other reviewers mentioned, it's not particularly cheap. You can't get great pizza for Pizza Hut prices. Today I also realized that the service there is really good. I also appreciate they carry Lavazza coffee and when they refill your cup they bring you a whole new fresh cup from the kitchen instead of just \"topping you off\".  The people seem genuinely friendly and the place is very clean and open. I see a lot of families there having a nice meal which is great to see these days.  Next time you want a good pie with quality ingredients, give them a whirl. Plus let's face it $25 for a large pizza isn't the most expensive meal you're ever going to have!",

I hesitate to give it a good rating because I like the fact that we have never waited in line to get in.    My only beefs are that I don't like the process of picking up the take-out items from the bartender and also the parking is a little limited when its busy.",

The people here are really nice.  Their only weakness in my opinion is that they have Pepsi, but that is a matter of taste and Pelligrino works fine when I am there.   Great flavors, crust is crisp but thinner than a New York style.  This is the best pizza in Las Vegas, the staff is very attentive and the ingredients are superb.  A few noisy kids do come through but it is worth the frustration.",

The sauce is light and the cheese is the best I've ever had on a pizza. It's not super cheesy and it appears to be clumps of cheese before they bake it instead of covering the pizza with shredded cheese. I could be wrong but that's how it looks.  The only thing I wish they would change is adding a few more items to the menu like garlic bread or something. Sometimes when you're super hungry you want an appetizer other than a salad. I'm used to it now and I'm prepared to wait, so I guess that's a good thing since I'm extra hungry when the pizza comes.  If you sign up for their email newsletter you get coupons for dine in visits. My favorite email from them, is a free pizza during your birthday month! Happy Birthday to me lol!",

We called ahead to let them know we had a party of 13 coming and they informed us that they don't take reservations, but if we get there before 5:30pm we should be fine. Okay. We head down and arrive at 5:30. As one of our party enters one of the hosts says, \"Oh you must be the party of 13.\" Yup, we have 13 and called ahead, but were told you don't hold tables. ANOTHER party of 13 enters right after us. They claim that they called ahead and were told a table would be prepared for them. The host staff then proceeded to seat the other party ahead of us! Really!?! We stood in front of the cold, crowded entrance for over a half hour waiting for our table.   I really don't feel this way often, but we were all disgusted with how we were treated. I talked to the manager afterward who seemed to me to be pretty disingenuous. Like, \"Yea, yea, that's terrible, we're so sorry. Wow, we feel so bad, is that all? Oh we'll discount your bill.\" She ended up taking $10 bucks off, which wasn't what we were looking for; but ended up being a slap in the face.   This review is intended to reflect this particular location. We love the food at Grimaldi's but will most likely drive across town to a different location in the future.   Easily the worst dining experience we've experienced this year.",

When we arrived I was told that the YELP wait list does not mean anything to them and that I would have to wait another 20min. But the tables were empty outside, and asked if we could be seated outside, then they said we could - I was disappointed, but decided to try this pizza as it is nearby where I live. We ordered  one large pizza half 4 cheese and half Margherita, it took them 45 min to get the pizza to us. The pizza was good, but the wait time was really long. The service was terrible, our waiter seemed completely lost, like he did not know what he was doing. Then I asked for the check, for my surprise they charged a whole 4 cheese pizza and $2 more for basil and another $2 for extra sauce. This is crazy, anywhere in the world, and I have been to many countries, including Italy, when you order half and half you always pay for the most expensive pizza. But that is not how they do it at Grimaldi's, they consider the most expensive pizza and charge additional toppings - which does not make any sense. It is not about the $4, it just felt dishonest. I will definitely not be coming back here.",

Located in a strip mall with a few other eateries, parking was actually pretty easy on a busy Friday night.  We tried to get a patio seat since the inside can get pretty noisy but we ended up right in the middle of the dining room.  Fortunately, the acoustic gods were with us and we were not surrounded by screaming kids.  Great service from the start.  They had a ton of employees running around filling drinks and clearing plates.  You get a choice of sauces....red, pesto and garlic oil, and a ton of traditional toppings.  I had a feeling the meatball would would be killer and I was correct.  I really top quality thin crust NY pie.  Great flavor, texture and a good bite to the crust.  Ready to get your mind blown?  They use slices of cheese instead of shredded....and they put the sauce on top of the toppings...  Boom!  OK...not too revolutionary but the results were good.

Overall, the place is nice and has a very relaxing/social atmosphere. The pizza was not the best I've had, but definitely one that I'd like to eat again. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, but we will be trying one of the white/garlic sauces next. The wait time was a bit much, but I noticed the oven being pretty backed up with orders, which just tells you how busy and popular they can get. Now, the highlight for me was actually not the pizza, but an Oreo Cheesecake. I had just had New York Cheese from Carnegie Deli a few days before (one of the best, period), but Grimaldi's made in house cheesecake was just as good. Will definitely be back!",

The hostess seated me right away. She asked if I have been here before and when I told her this was my first time. She was excited to highlight the menu to me.   The service was prompt and friendly. Rena made me feel right at home. It's Top off Tuesday (1/2 off wine) I discovered and enjoyed two glasses of Lock & Key Meritage.   I had the small Caesar (which is really a LARGE) and enough to feed two and the Personal Pesto Pizza with Pepperoni for $2.00 extra ($12.00 total) for a personal pizza which can really feed two. But what the hell, I'll fill up on Salad and take the 4 left over big slices of pizza to go.   The thin crust pizza met my approval. If I wasn't so full from Salad and wine, I could have attempted another slice put happy to know I have cold pizza the next day waiting for me. My server Rena did quite a good job selling me on the Chocolate Chessecake that I ordered one to go.   I think I left fat, (almost drunk-but-not- quite) & very happy.  I was left alone to read my Kindle, attended to so I never had to ask...and generally enjoyed my solitude in a very bustling but fun atmosphere. Better than New York City can ever dish out.",

The pizza is much different from what I am usually used to.   They have only a few items to choose from on the menu, like salad and pizza choices only.   If it gets cold it pretty much has to be thrown out because it gets really hard even when heated up.   Great thing about this place is that they use a coal oven. That's really good, it always makes pizza better.   The pizza was decent, but just not my type.",

    "text": "Well, let me first start by saying my dinner last night at this place was me giving this place a second chance.   The first time I went I ordered my pizza with light sauce,   when my pizza arrived it had sauce oozing all over it.  The server was quite apologetic and offered me something else or to have the pizza remade, but I was with others and I didn't want to make them wait so I just opted to not eat.  So round two with this this place was even more traumatizing!   We arrived to wait for hostess to come up front because she was yakking it up with  the servers by the kitchen area.   We were seated in a little side room where we were pretty much ignored but I did get a good feel for the atmosphere.  After about 10 mins, waiting Server #1 strolled by and asked if we had been helped.   He gave me his name and took our drink and food order.  I once again mentioned I wanted light sauce on the pizza, no onions in my salad, and just a water w/lemon to drink.  Someone else brought our drinks and there was no lemon in the water so I asked Server # 2 for the lemon and he assured me he would bring back.  That never happened because a 3rd server brought our salads.   The salad was full of onions and so I did not eat it.  It sat on the edge of our table for about another 15mins until a 4th server brought our pizza.   The pizza was made correctly so I took a chance and asked this server for the lemon which he did return with and I gave him the salad and asked that he remove it from the bill because I couldn't eat it.  Through the meal no other servers ever checked on us.  In fact I had to flag down one just to get my daughter a drink refill.  The place was not very busy but yet all the Servers were clustered either by the kitchen or bar and everyone was laughing and joking amongst themselves, at one point I noted one Server swinging between the two counter areas.   I had to flag someone down again to get my pizza boxed and get my check.   I waited another 10 mins and no one ever came to get my check so I finally was annoyed and took the check to the front where once again the hostess was standing holding the front door open and chatting w/another employee and not at the hostess area.     I usually leave at 20% tip at most places because I do understand how hard Servers work as I used to work for a restaurant company, but this time the only tip I left was a note on the check stating they needed to improve their customer service.   As for the food it's mediocre at best, nothing really stands out about it, so I most definitely will not give them a third chance.  Their customer service ruined it completely for me.  :(",

We essentially created our own pizza, they do not list specialty pizzas so you pick your own. It was very flavorful and had fresh toppings on a light crispy crust baked in a coal oven. The one thing I was puzzled by was when we asked for butter they said they did not have for the bread but did give us oil and balsamic as a substitute. We stopped in to pick it up and I was very impressed with the ambiance it's as if you were in another city. I would highly reccomend dining in.",

We decided to try Grimaldi's late on a Saturday night.  The hostess was quick to seat us in a half empty restaurant.  Our waitress waited 8 minutes before stopping by our table.  She said she would be right back to take our drink order.  Approximately 10 minutes later she returned and said that she was so sorry and stated that they were so busy.  As I look around I notice that more then half the tables are empty and I see numerous waitresses.  Oh well, maybe she was new.  She brings our drinks by quite some time later and apologizes again.  I can't stand when people keep saying sorry with no meaning behind it!  If you're sorry, change what you are doing!!  Eventually we got some food!!  Pizza - you choose your toppings for every pizza which range from $2 a piece to $4 a piece.  You can easily make a $30 pizza.  It's thin crust and it was eh!  I ordered white Sangria which was different!  It kind of tasted like moscato and sprite with a slice of orange.   The only pizza I really enjoyed was Pizza Fusion and they are gone! :'( I would try other pizza places before I came back here.",

We at first wanted to sit outside in the patio but there weren't any available tables at the moment. Rather than waiting, we just sat inside, a two-top table across from the bar.  We split a small pizza and both ordered some peach iced tea. Half the pizza was pepperoni with jalepenos, the other half with sliced meatballs, ricotta and mushrooms. It arrived nice and hot. I loved the thin crust, it was perfectly foldable. The ricotta cheese was very flavorful and complemented the meatballs quite well. I would say that the pepperoni side was just average though. The server came by once in awhile to check on us and filled up our drinks.  What I liked best about this place was the noise level. Too often I go to a pizza place and I can hardly hear what anyone is saying. Here, we're sitting next to the bar (who had the TV on) and there were a steady stream of customers in the restaurant. Yet, we could still hear each other talk.  My dining companion wanted to get some dessert, their cheesecakes, after the pizza, however upon finishing the pizza the server came over and just plopped down the check. Did not even ask if we wanted dessert.  Overall, I would say that this is a nice place for a lunch meeting or date. Don't expect anything too fancy.",

It started out first with the beer selection. Okay, not a big deal as food is more important but they're out of a beer we chose and they didn't even offer a suggestion. We ordered a large pizza and got two toppings (sausage and mushrooms). I could literally count all the sausage toppings and mushrooms were just as sparse. For a place that charges by the topping, we felt ripped off!  Service wasn't that much better. The table nearby had more food and drinks and could tell they got better service the entire time because of it. Ridiculous for the party of two!  By the time we are almost half the pizza, it became rubbery and impossible to cut with a fork and knife, bleh! We had one slice left over and decided to get it to go. When we tried eating it later that evening it was disgusting! Needless to say we won't be returning to this or any of the other Grimaldi's locations.",

So I deal with it. But tonight DINING with Roaches out-side was just too much. they wore every were. I even had one craw on my feet. finally I got so tired of it and already had said something about it got up and went and took a seat at the bar as the waitress still offers me and the rest of my party dessert.... Of course i said i did not want to have to share with the roaches and all she had to say was that the manager said that they sprayed in the morning and hands me the full bill no I am sorry's or at least the manager to come and say something. OH WELL .....",

There was no wait which was a huge plus since we were hungry and the hostess was very friendly from the moment we walked in.   We asked to sit near the TV's and she asked if we wanted a high top or table we chose table and it was the perfect setting. Our waitress Monica was super friendly and fast. She allowed us to sample a few wines which was really cool. We ended up getting 2 glasses of vino and a large Don Pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and the pizza was cooked perfectly. Monica checked in on us to ensure everything was good which was a plus for me and even ensured our water glasses were full.  Even though it was just my husband and I it is a very friendly family restaurant and atmosphere. I've dined here before but tonight's experience was amazing and I couldn't pass on writing a tremendous review.   When leaving the hostess even opened the door for my husband and I & wished a nice evening!! The service, food and people are spectacular here and I will DEFINITELY return!",

Unfortunately we sat next to an elderly couple that thought they were eating at a different pizzeria because when their Sicilian pizza came the gentleman was so upset that his pizza was round and not square . Although his wife had already eaten a few pieces he insisted that wasn't what he ordered and quickly became every server's worst nightmare. What was so impressive to all of us was how calm and professional both the waiter and the Manager were while attempting to make this impossible customer happy. The manager went out of his way to offer to make another pizza exactly how the gentleman wanted so by the time the couple left he had them smiling and laughing. I'm also a manager that deals with customers and trust me when I say, Mike, who I believe is the name of the manager is one exceptional manager that we could all take a lesson from with regards to outstanding customer service!",

I can't tell you what we ordered because being outnumbered two guys to one girl I had no say, so the boys customized and added the works! which was ok because I'm not picky at all! I can tell you we did order a pizza and some sort of calzone, and that Lindsay, our server from Chicago, was an absolute sweet heart and was so patient, and friendly with both my knuckle headed friends!!   The pizza though was delicious!! Half of our pizza was some sort of BBQ chicken while the other half was some sort of meat lovers. Again, I don't know what they ordered  but it was amazing!! The calzone too was great, it had slight hints of jalapeno which gave it some nice heat which paired nicely with all of the ricotta cheese inside! It was amazing! And can I just add that they also play FRANK SINATRA!! totally awesome!! Our Server was wonderful, the ambience is comfortable, the food is amazing and we had a great time!!",

Both pizza must have died too because they were ice cold. The one pizza had grilled chicken on it, who doesn't like juicy grilled chicken strips on pizza? If you guessed Grimaldi's you're right because these strips of chicken were so over cooked and tough they could pass as beef jerky, terrible. Here's the fun part though the pizza was under done and you could scoop raw dough out of it, the onions were raw, and the chicken must've been cooked at least three times and smelt and tasted old. The only complaint I had about the traditional pizza was the temperature but come on guys, you really need to pull your heads out of your you know where's.",

The Caesar was fine, it's the pizza that was so disappointing. The pizza was soggy in the middle. So soggy that I couldn't pick up a slice without it sinking and bending in half and the toppings falling off. The veggies on this pizza were boring -- Roma tomato, olives, mushroom, and big slices of white onion. Nothing special at all. Nothing with flavor.   Never again.",

Both were outstanding with my wife and I remarking how we wanted to order another because it was so good.   We will definitely be at Grimaldi's again.

    "text": "I have eaten at a lot of pizza places in Vegas - and I won't sit here and claim this is the best of the best in town - but it certainly shares the top spot with one or two others.  Grimaldi's is absolutely delicious!!  First off - the crust.  It's that thin NY style, with a great char flavor - it combines crispy and chewy in just the right way.  Secondly - the cheese/sauce - thin slices of buffalo mozzarella, with a delicious tangy/sweet red sauce makes for a combo that provides enough flavor that you really don't need any additional toppings - that being said...the toppings are delicious too!  I would recommend this place to anyone in town!  One thing I would suggest is keep the additional toppings to a minimum - I never get more than two - because they start to take away from the amazing flavor the pizza already has.  My personal combos are Pepperoni/Mushroom and Kalamata Olive/Mushroom - yummmmm :)  Service has always been great - even during the busy times.  Enjoy!  Seriously...go. Now.  Do it.",

But always a good pie and Peroni on tap.  Be aware you do pay a premium for a premium pizza. Nevertheless, it's worth the money. Perfect crust and an array of toppings like ricotta and artichoke. Fun place for a quick bite or a casual date night.   Oh and the antipasto is great!",

We were lucky enough to get seated in the little private area out of the noise and nobody else was seated in the rooms with us.  Very nice!  The main dining room does get loud so if you like it quiet, ask for this room.  The Pizza?  Oh yeah, the pizza.  Freakin' GOOD.  Especially if you like that thin crust.  We all ordered our own (yes, way too much food) but it was nice to customize exactly what I wanted and not have to share my precious bounty.  I don't ever do deserts.  But our waiter talked us into ordering an Oreo Cheesecake.  I wasn't going to even have a bite but I did out of curiosity and Whoa Doctor!!!  ... that bad boy is GOOD!  cRaZy GOOD!  Don't hesitate to give this chain restaurant a chance.  We were pleasently surprised!!!",

    "text": "By far consistently the best pizza in Vegas and as good as the New York original. Dinner is best if you like crispy and chewy crust. Lunch is often thicker and softer but still delicious. Always good service and the occasional and very rare problem is always taken care of. After 5 or more years of eating here, this really is a great place and proves that you can get real pizza in the west. Avoid excessive toppings which can overwhelm the wonderful crust, keep it simple. Highly recommended.  One update. Recently (late 2015) a few of the pizzas have had skimpy toppings and very little cheese. I checked with the staff and they have not officially changed anything so it looks like one of the chefs is cutting back for some reason. We now check with the server that we are getting why we expect.",

We got a nice spot on the sunny patio and enjoyed delicious thin-crust pizza. Our waitress took a little bit of time getting to our table at first, but another waiter checked in on us to let us know she would be with us. Very nice. I felt valued by every employee we encountered, which is not something you get to experience very often (unfortunately)!  Personal pizza is pretty big (if you're a big eater, you could probably finish it but I only ate half.)  Base price starts at I think $9 and toppings are an extra $2 to $4 dollars ish depending on what you get. My total with tip was like $19, which for lunch is a bit steep. For me it's worth it because I still have leftovers!",

But the service here is unparalleled, especially for a pizza joint. This time we had the immense pleasure of being helped by Joelle. She is definitely on it like Blue Bonnet. Patient in explaining the menu and pizza sauce variations etc. Also very efficient and fun loving too. I brought several family members here for my off to the airport meal, and we all had a blast with Joelle as our enabler. And this was on a random Monday lunch when you expect most restaurants to have their B team. I have a feeling they don't have a B team here.   Thanks again Grimaldis for another 5 star service experience.",

Pepperoni only for me. Never liked mushrooms, never had meatballs or basil on my pizza. First time I tried all of these on a pizza was at Grimaldis & let me tell you it was the BEST pizza I ever had! Now guess what I order every time I come here?? Yep I'm pretty sure I'm addicted. Also had the Caesar salad which was very fresh & tasty. It is a MUST TRY! Best pizza you will get in Vegas.

The pizza arrived another 10 minutes later and the manager came by to say he would \"make things right.\" At that point the people in our party who had ordered the second pizza did not want to have the rest of us who had already finished their meal wait for them, and only ate one slice each leaving half the pizza.   The bill came and for the manager \"making things right\" was to remove the charge for the second pizza. To me that would have been the starting point, since the meal had been ruined for everyone.

    "text": "This pizza restaurant was our plan B after our unsuccessful attempt to eat at Carson Kitchen in downtown Las Vegas, unfortunately they were closed for a private party event.  Generally, I dislike going to any restaurant located inside a hotel on the strip because the traffic, parking, and combined walking distance is inconvenient.  The Palazzo is a nice higher end hotel so going here made it a bit more tolerable.  The restaurant itself lets you feel like you are having dinner outside, this was nice.    We ordered the antipasto, spinach salad, and The Don pizza (pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs).  The thin crust pizza is cooked under intense heat for a short time in their brick oven, to me it tastes like your standard Napoli style pizza - they're okay but I don't like the way the crust is always burnt.  If you're a fan of Chicago style pan pizza then this place may not be for you.  My wife on the other hand just loved it and said it was the best pizza she ever had.  It was good - tangy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and that slightly salted meat taste hit the spot.  We also enjoyed the spinach salad because it came with other healthy stuff like crispy bacon and Gorgonzola cheese.   The antipasto was good as well - hard to go wrong with cold cuts, sliced cheese, olives, and jarred red peppers on a plate.  This paired well with their bread, olive oil, and vinegar for dipping.  I later learned that this restaurant is available in 5 other locations, we'll be sure to bookmark the locations off the strip the next time we are in Las Vegas.",

I forgot I was a part of their Birthday Club and low and behold I get the email wishing me Happy Birthday in the form of a free pizza. It didn't end up being completely free, but I don't care. What I do care about is I tasted the glory in their white sauce pizza with sausage. It was garlicky, it was crispy and slightly chewy and just the right amount of every ingredient. I would have liked a little more fresh Basil, but that is the story of my life. The sausage was savory and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients.This pizza was just what I needed and I have even almost gone back. I know, it's insane.  Downfalls. Because you know I gots sum;)  1. Loud, loud, loud. I'm not sure if it's because of the flooring or brick walls, but I could not think it was so terribly loud and it gave me extreme anxiety. My hearing is better than most so imagine being able to hear twenty conversations at once. Yeah, bad news bears. Next time I return I will be wearing headphones.  2. Bright lights. Pet peeve is bright lights in a restaurant in the evening. I don't need to see or hear the fifty kids fondling their raw dough, wasting the parm on the table and pretending to make their own za. I also don't need to see my date's pores. Ever.  3. 4pm. Whatever you do 4pm is not the time to come to Grimaldi's. They do something to the oven at that time for about 20-30 minutes and you cannot get a pizza. Instead you have to eat a boring salad with a bitter dressing and stare at each other. You can't talk because you can't hear each other over the noise. I really think the chef might just be celebrating 4:20p everyday getting erie mon. Whatever he did my pie tasted like a million bucks so keep on keepin on Chef pizza dude.   Will I return? Oh hellz yeah. Just for the Large White Sauce with Garlic and Sausage and extra Basil pie. Kudos Grimaldi's for redeeming yourself. I am feelin' you big time. Until we meet again my new white saucy friend.",

However, if you choose to sit inside, be prepared. Secondly, because this place is so great, it is getting a lot more popular. Last time we went here I had a very hard time finding a parking spot. Had to resort to parking across the street, which is very inconvenient.",

The waitress Bryna (dark hair in ponytail, olive complexion, average build) came to take our drink order. We had drinks at home so we declined and asked for waters. That were things started to go downhill.  -She cleared away the wine glasses in a abrupt manner, banging them into the pizza rack on our table and walked away without saying a word. -After a long wait, she finally came to take our order. We declined to order salads and that made her walk away huffing and puffing. -The food came, and the one time she did come to check on us she did not look at us when speaking and whatever she was saying was inaudible. -We paid with a giftcard and she came back after awhile acting annoyed and saying she has to wait for the manager to apply the giftcard. -As she was explaining this, our credit card fell from her hand onto the table and she picked it up and walked away without saying anything.   She made us feel like she was mad because we didn't order a lot of food because she sure was chatting it up with the party at the table next to us. I filled out a comment card but don't know if it ever made it to management.  I plan on coming back but I just hope she never waits on us again.",

I usually wait to long and it expires but this year I was determined to use it.  We went today, it wasn't to busy and we were seated right away.  We ordered the white pizza half with sausage and mushrooms (since so many yelp reviews recommended this).  While we were waiting out server brought my son some pizza dough to play with while we wait.  That was nice since sometimes the pizza can take awhile.  The pizza was very good.  I preferred the plain white to the white with sausage and mushrooms.  I still think Secret Pizza's white pizza is better but this is a good off strip option.  I am not a huge fan of thin crust anywhere and here it is a little to crispy for me.  Overall it was still a good pie, especially in Las Vegas where good pizza is hard to find.",

    "text": "I've been here several times but only on my recent visit have I discovered I like Grimaldis less that I thought I did. I enjoy the thin crisp crust but I hate the fact they charge for every topping. Pizza starts at $14 for small and ranges up to $18 for large. Then add your toppings. Only cheese comes.m every additional topping is an added fee. Most of the time I'm here with a few gal pals so the bill is so cheap for the three of us because we divide the bill three or four ways. The last visit the pizza was so dry. Needed more sauce and cheese. Had we added more it would have been a $30 pie. Which is too pricey in my opinion for some almost burnt pizza. All the other visits have been pretty decent so I will give the benefit of the doubt. The salads here are always fresh and tasty. My favorites are the Mediterranean and the Caesar. With plenty of pizza options in Vegas if we continue to get dry burnt pizza, Grimaldis will no longer be an option.",

    "text": "WHERE: Eastern & Richmar (inside the plaza, right by Cafe Rio)  WHY: If you're craving legit New York style pizza, this is the place to be!  WHAT: I never thought for once that I would be able to taste the difference between pizzas until I came here.  For years, I've always thought that pizza was just pizza! Little did I know, pizza here is beyond Little Caesar's!  I am a part of a charity, and we actually held a charity event here a few months ago, and it was the first time I've ever stepped foot into this place. I mean, I've seen it around, but never got to trying it.  Let me tell you! The entire staff including the manager were all wonderful, accommodating, and super friendly!  They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)  Note: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!  Now onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!  FUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...  I HOPE SO... GO NOW! THERE ARE SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE CITY =D",

It was amazing. Came to a total of 17.30, pricey but I guess it was worth it.  3 for the service because they overcharged me and when I called to see about them correcting it I was told It wasn't possible and he would gladly give me a couple bucks if I came back to the restaurant wtf??? I wouldn't have been in this situation if it wasn't for THEIR mistake and now I have to drive back to collect my money. Didn't sit well with me, I have been to a couple places that made the same mistake and fixed it on the spot so it sounds sketchy to me.

We were so hungry so ordered the food rite away and had to wait almost about 45 minutes to get the food. Had I know earlier I would have never gone there for the food.  Also ordered tiramisu to go and ask for the fork so my wife can eat in the car. They didn't even have the forks.  By the time we left the restaurant it was packed.

    "text": "Summary: True NY style pizza, crispy and holds up to the old NYC pizza test: \"hold slice with one hand and if it does not slump over or require a second hand than the crust was created and cooked perfectly!\"  In depth: being from NY the lady and myself are slight pizza snobs. Grimaldi's on Eastern has always delivered a solid pie that reminds us of back home. See people complaining about the crust and I think they are simply uneducated. The crisp and darkened crust is the way this \"coal oven\" pie is served. That coal oven taste is transferred into the crust and gives it amazing consistency and flavor. This is not the Albanian owned knock off pizza parlors that most Vegas locals have grown accustomed to eating.   I like to add the Ricotta Cheese, fresh tomatoes and sausage to my pie. I also like artichokes and think they make a decent topping along with olives.   The Caprese salad here is the bomb. I like to add salami for an additional $2 more (see my pics).   I only removed a star for two reasons: 1) the cost seems a little too high for pizza. It tastes good and I am a customer, I only feel like we would go more if it was priced appropriately. 2) service can be spotty when you eat in. Had to get up and track down our waitress last night to take our order.   Lastly, Grimadi's makes for great left over cold pizza. Make sure you take a couple slices home for cold pizza breakfast the next day!",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 67/100  I went here a few nights ago with a few friends to redeem the free birthday pizza which is actually, getting $19 off your choice of pizza and additional charge for additional toppings. Which isn't a bad deal.   We sat closest to the kitchen so we had a great view of the pizza making process. I'm always fascinated to see how things are made, especially pizza!   We had the kale salad and a large pizza with little slices of pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta.  For me, the kale salad was okay. It was a mix of curly kale, romaine, drenched in a lemon vinaigrette & a few slices of lemon. I don't like too much dressing on my salad.   My friends seem to like it. It just depends on your eating habits. I tend to enjoy healthier salads. I liked the option to drizzle fresh squeezed lemon.   I expected the pizza to be better, because I hear people raving about it all the time. I didn't like the crust. The pizza toppings were great, and they gave a great amount of toppings. But the slices were too big and too heavy to fold & hold and it made the crust soggy, so I used a fork and knife. Bummed because I prefer to hold my pizza while I eat it. While eating the last couple slices the dough was hard to chew so I ended up just eating the toppings.   I loved the black and white photos on the wall, the ambiance, and bottle light fixtures. Server was fast and checked in with us every so often.   My expectations weren't high for this place because it's a chain but I thought it would be better than what I experienced. Willing to give it another chance but with other pizza places on my to-try list it will be a while before I come back to this place.",

This time we decided to apply that $20 to a specialty pizza and ordered the Don with onions.  It was a great selection and plenty of food for my father and I.  We sipped on some beers on their nice patio and enjoyed the perfect fall weather.  The food is always good, the service is always good, and atmosphere is always good but the prices could be lower.  I guess the prices don't really matter since I only go when I get my birthday coupon but maybe that is what is keeping me from going more often.",

It was also cooked nicely, I asked for crispy and it was.  I think they could have done a better job with the amount and variety of vegetables.  The sauce was very bland and they barely put any on.  I def have had better pizza.  Way overpriced and skimpy with sauce and toppings.",

It was a delicious red and bold Cabernet.   The wine paired perfectly with our pizza and house salad. If you haven't tried Grimaldi's or oven brick pizza go in at your next chance. The smoky flavor gives the crust a unique taste. I recommended trying one of their preselected pizzas you really can't go wrong.   The salads are fresh and come in various flavors. Usually I stick to the house salad because I prefer an original leafy vegetable taste but if your bold try their seasonal salad.   I have been coming to Grimaldi's for years.  Highly recommend! This location is right off the freeway and seating is usually not a problem. All the servers are cheerful and attentive!",

I ordered a small Caesar salad which was just meh but the white pizza I ordered killed it! Sooo much garlic and thin crust goodness! They also give you a bottle of parmesan cheese with the pizza which I appreciated so I didn't have to ask. Def a go to spot if you're near the Venetian or Sands. This week will be packed with people for CES so get there early for Lunch! The only downside I would say is they don't sell slices...I was eating alone so a bit annoyed I had to order a full pizza...but either way still worth the trip!",

This already busy area doesn't have a lot of parking to accommodate what could be.  It's very hectic in and out so be ready for that.    Walking up to the door, the welcoming hostess opened the door and escorted us in.  The staff here were all very polite and courteous.  Our server Alex was amazing.  He was attentive with a fun personality.    I decide to try their Caesar Salad and Calzone.  The salad was tasty and large for a small salad.  I loved the fresh shaved parmesan and cracked pepper. Delicious.    I opted to stuff the calzone with spinach and mushrooms.  They really did a great job using fresh and plenty of ingredients inside.  Ricotta is one of their normal ingredients used inside so you don't have to order it extra.  Nice! Their dipping sauce on the side gave it a great flavor that I'm sure I'll be back for.    I certainly enjoyed a lovely dining experience here.  I hope it won't be long before my next visit.",

Coal ovens might have been the thing back in the early days and they are experiencing a bit of a renaissance with Grimaldi's and others, but modern NY pizza comes out of normal ovens, has oregano already on the slice, has that droopy tip and also that small layer of grease drips onto your paper plate. That being said, GRimaldi's is one of the best gourmet pizza's in town and I guess the country now. At $20 a pizza that's the category it belongs in, but the staff is very friendly and the large meatball pie I consumed at the bar was hot, fresh and excellent. I hope when this place has 80 restaurants the quality will remain the same. It's sad to see another good place turn into a monster chain, but greed rules these days and this joint could turn into a Chili's of Pizza someday - I hope not.",

    "text": "Reading other reviews on here is laughable.  PEOPLE IT\"S THIN CRUST PIZZA.  If you don't like thin crust then stay away from this place.  It's also COAL FIRED OVEN.  If you don't understand this,, the coal heats at a higher temperature than fire or other means leaving this thin crust cooked crisp with a few chars here and there.  Anyway, I dislike thick crust pizzas because my opinion is the crust can absorb/take away from the flavors on the pizza.  When Grimaldis opened (I actually was a subcontractor for part of the building so I was aware as it was coming into town) I decided to try and I absolutely think it's the best pizza in Vegas minus specialty gourmet pizzas which I give to Metro. The crust in my opinion is great, the fire roasted pepper yummy, the thick pepperoni, sausage extremely flavorful, And get this ,, the few people in here complaining about the cheese IT\"S WHOLE SLICED MOZZARELLA.  I don't know if you understand that when a pizza place uses pre shredded cheese it looses some flavor as it has to be preserved  and prevented from hardening and sticking together.  The whole slices of cheese on Grimaldis pizza adds a great effect and provides in my opinion the best flavor the cheese can offer. If you want piles of shredded cheese that starts stretching and stringing as you have to keep pulling it away from you as you try to eat then you won't like Grimaldis.  Basically, IT's all about proportions.  I think Grimaldis has found the best, crust,cheese, sauce proportion for me. I can taste everything without getting full on the first slice.  Also, sign up for their email and get a free large pizza every year for your Birthday,, it's a great deal LOL. If you decide Grimaldis doesn't have the toppings you desire then there's only one other place in vegas and that is Metro.",

The pepperoni & kalmata olives large pizza is my absolute favorite. I have probably gotten 20 people hooked on their pizza & it's turned into a must go to lunch spot for my sales crew. The service is excellent & Vince & Rob do a super job with the staff. My wife though thinks it's highly overrated & would rather have Verrazano's or Villa.

    "text": "The thin crust pizza was good. It deserved a recommendation. However, there are 2 points that need to be considered. (1) We were seated by the hostess and waited 15 min before I called over a waiter and was told that he was not my waiter. He took the orders and sent for my waiter. 5 min later he showed up and from then on it was fine. (2) For a large pizza with 3 toppings $24 was on the high side but was comparable to Metro Pizza which charged slightly more but gave less toppings per pizza. Putting it in perspective, a good dish at a good Italian restaurant cost about $25. Overall, I would go back for their thin crust pizza despite the slow service and pricey charge, because it was good.",

    "text": "It's all about New York style pizza. Deep dish is so overrated. For me, pizza is all about the crust and Grimaldi's did a great job of baking the pizza to the right crispiness. Out of the many things we ordered, my favorite was the Mushroom Chicken. The sauce had a great flavor and the cheese was so fresh it made me want to punch babies. The white sauce pizza was good but it didn't have enough flavor for me. I still ate a bunch of slices though. Our server was really nice and attentive. Good food, good service, good times.",

    "text": "Can't believe this place hasn't gotten more reviews, but I'm here to support. This also gets posted on Facebook so that I can promote it. I would give this place 5-stars just for food. I'll be honest about that. The 1 star deduction is just for price. It is quite pricey to get the perfect pizza. Which is probably what I got. We got a tip from the local to get extra sauce, extra cheese, and fresh garlic. I'll tell you right now each of those items are 2$ a piece. Me and 3 other friends got a large which I think is an 18\" pizza, we all picked a topping and added the 3 mentioned above, one already being my friend's aloof choice, one added mushroom, another added pepporoni, and I added ricotta cheese (which I think helped make the pizza that good hehe). The pizza itself was 16$ I think, but add 12$ in added-ons, and there ya go 28$ but it was pretty damn good. I have to honestly say it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I've had my share of the mom and pop joints, hell I love em' but this place is just great. The crust perfectly wood oven baked, the amount of each ingredient was perfect, but still curious if we ordered extra cheese and extra sauce, I didn't feel like there was extra anything hehe, but otherwise a great pizza, and wouldn't mind coming back here again.",

It was really good - pepperoni was a little thick so it was a pretty salty bite.  That said, this is one of the best, authentic, NY style pizzas I've had since coming back from NYC.  Just pretty darn expensive, like NYC.  Guess the whole coal burning, specially calibrated water pump and free range mozzarella costs that pretty penny.  So basically, our bill was $32 for a small caesar, small pizza with one topping, an Iced Tea and a rootbeer.  Again, it was good, but I probably wouldn't go there very often, even if there was a location in Socal.",

    "text": "Went to check out this place one night for dinner with my cousin after seeing an ad in one of the local newspapers and being from New York we had to see for ourselves if this place even compared to Lombardi's or the Original Grimaldi's in NYC. First the menu is simple in the good way, salads, pizzas, calzones, strombolis, and desserts and thats about it. Everything is fresh and made to order. We ordered a large (18\") pizza with sausage, meatballs and roasted garlic. I though the pizza was excellent and had plenty of flavor and very filling. My cousin thought it could be crisper but just ask your waiter to cook it a little longer for that extra crunch or if you have to many toppings can make it soggy. Maybe the coal oven need to be seasoned more. The decor seems to be standard New York with black and white pictures of famous locals like the Brooklyn bridge Empire State bldg. etc... This place is new to Vegas but old school when it comes to pizza. Not as good as Lombardi's in NYC but it the best out here!",

We ordered pepperoni and jalapenos but there were too many jalapenos - close to 10 pieces per slice.  We also ordered a small chicken and artichokes pesto pizza which was good but was really heavily topped with cheese.  Typically a thin crust pizza has fewer toppings than a thicker crust pizza but these were filled with toppings.  The Caesar salad was great, not overly dressed and a small was plenty to split between two people.   Also, a large pizza is 18 inches - so make sure you're hungry!",

I feel a strong need to share the outstanding service we received from Stanley.  I was seated before my friends arrived and didn't see a server for over five minutes. I had flashbacks to a few weeks ago and briefly considered sending a text to change our meeting place. A few minutes later, one of my friends arrived and I explained what I was thinking. As I was sharing my thoughts, Stanley arrived and introduced himself as our server.  I explained to him my experience for two reasons: (1) I never did hear about my inquiry after the last visit, I wanted someone in the place to acknowledge it; and (2) I didn't want a repeat and ruined meal. He made a point of not just nodding and smiling, but listening, asking questions, and assuring us that we would not have to worry tonight.  Stanley was fantastic! Special orders were accomodated, wine service was excellent, and his care for us (and, in fact, the other tables around us) was perfect. There was some slow going with the food from the kitchen, but we weren't about to shoot the messenger; he was communicative and helpful and jovial, taking the time to enjoy our company and make sure that we had an enjoyable experience with him. He wasn't just a server, he was a participant in our little dinner party and it made all the difference.  The food and ambiance are still (just) A-OK, 3 stars. Stanley's 5-star service is what makes me inclined to give this place 4 stars for this visit.   FYI to the winos: Bonus points for the wine list with a lot of  inexpensive yet drinkable wines - big fan! Bottles... yes, bottles, for $20? At a restaurant? Some are better than others, for sure, and they also carry a lot of variety all the way into the more expensive ranges... this was a nice discovery!   Possibility of return? I can definitely see it happening if this type of service continues!",

Ive got it the last few times I have made it to a Grimaldis and its been amazing every single time.  They slice the meatballs real thin and then pile them on.  Its a great combo of flavors and I would recommend it if you haven't tried it before.  One of the managers there told us that they are looking into branching out into Southern California some time in the next few years.  I instantly got a boner!  I heard they couldn't have them out here because of the coal ovens and pollution or something to that effect.  The guy assured us that's not why and they really are looking to come out to CA sometime soon.  Cross the fingers....that would be A M A Z I N G!",

Pizza - we made a custom small pizza. We added ricotta cheese, pepporoni, and fresh garlic.  The pizza was delicious, dough chewy, and dripping with oil. Just how i like my NY style pizza.

Food quality - 1 star Inside of my pizza box lay a black ring of burnt crust with a smattering of toppings tossed on top. The crust was burnt so much we could not eat it. I know a brick oven crust has some character and some char to the edges, but this was ridiculous. We paid $2 each for four different toppings. For $2 of onions, I counted 13 pieces of onions. $2 for a small handful of jalapeno STEMS. The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can. The sausage was the only tasty topping on our pizza. The cheese was as flavorless as the crust. Maybe if the cheese was burnt, it would have had some flavor.   Food price - 1 star Compared to similar pizza places, excluding the fast food pizza places like Pizza Hut, the prices are a little high. If you only want a couple of toppings, your pizza will be cheap. If you like a lot of toppings, you should bring you last paycheck. My four topping, large pizza, complete with flavorless cheese and a burnt crust came two $25.   Overall, not a great experience. I'm confident in saying I would rather have a slice of pizza from my school's cafeteria. Too much money and way too much disappointment.",

    "text": "This place was way hyped up before I got there so I had high expectations.  We picked up 2 pizzas.  The place was real nice inside - nice enough for a date or something.  NExt time I would liek to stay and eat there instead of take-out... especially since the pizza can lose some of it's integrity in transit.  So we got the pepperoni pizza home.  It is a thin crust plenty of toppings.  This is way different than your average delivery pizza.  It was good.  Real mozzerella cheese and real pepperoni.  I really enjoyed this pizza.  Kind of an artisan pizza - I think these people are trying to make a good pizza.  Just a personal note, and I am objective in my reviews so this does not take down the rating - just a personal issue.  I do not like a pretensous type of pizza joint.  I want a regular type of place - nothing fancy.  Also, over $40 for 2 pizzas!!! Digity dang.   So this is a nice place - tony for a pizza joint... it serves real good pizza.",

The ingredients are good quality so it makes for a good pizza. If the sauce wasn't so bland then I would have given it a 5 (despite the service) ordering for pick up works out great though. The sauce taste like it was just scooped out of a can of crushed tomatoes... BUT plain canned tomatoes can sometimes be better than some of the pizza sauces out there. I still think Settebello's is a better pizza.",

It may seem like a small thing but I've never experienced it at another restaurant in Las Vegas like at Grimaldi's on Eastern. Three different servers and each one let our two drinks sit empty for 15-20 minutes before refilling. On our last visit we got our sodas filled when we sat and weren't offered refills until we were brought the check 45 minutes later.     I understand they are busy, and deservingly so, but the place isn't huge and we sat in plain sight; they walked by our table at least half a dozen times.   Three stars may seem harsh because the pizza is great and the staff is friendly, but the soda thing is an issue that's happened too many times in a row to ignore.",

This place is located on Eastern Avenue very conveniently close to 215 so it won't be hard to get there, and the restaurant does offer a few parking spaces that unfortunately tend to be occupied most of the time. The restaurant itself isn't so large, so you might have to wait to get seated depending on the time/day.  I had several different types of pizza there, and the pizzas were always fresh and decently but I would definitely have expected something better, particularly given the price of the pizza/toppings.  One good thing about this place is the atmosphere which is pretty nice, with the restaurant's decor participating quite greatly to it.  In conclusion, I would say that this place is average but you could still check it out if you're in the area and are craving pizza!

    "text": "Wow, the bf is right, I'm hooked on Grimaldi's!  We went for dinner last night and everything was perfect, the food, weather, ambiance!  We ordered a small caesar salad to share, yes share, yes a small ($7).  A perfect portion for two.  The dressing was zesty, ample, and quite addicting.  The croutons were fresh, large, and crispy (but not jaw breaking).  The lettuce was fresh and green.  The parmesan was good but the stuff that was factory shredded, not freshly shaved.  I'm a sucker for freshly shaved parm, you know the stuff that resembles potato chips.  Regardless, the bf will be picking up a random caesar salad after work for me to chow down on.  The pizza was quite delightful!  Their crust is thin and flaky with very good flavor.  Their sauce gets two thumbs up for not being overpowering or chunky, like some of these pizza joints tend to get a little over zealous about.  And the cheese, oh the cheese...it's freshly made mozzarella!  Each pizza gets thin slices of this freshly made mozzarella!  Therefore, when your pizza is presented, it almost glows because the mozzarella is a beautifully brilliant white!  Grimaldi's uses some delicious toppings too, if you so choose to garnish your pie.  Instead of the traditional size pepperonis, they use miniature sized ones.  I think it makes the pepperoni pie easier to eat, but that's just my opinion.  The ambiance of the Eastern Ave. Grimaldi's is quite charming, even for being in a strip mall.  We here in Las Vegas are lucky to have such beautiful weather pretty much year round, therefore open air bistros like Grimaldi's are a gem on such gorgeous days/nights.  The layout of the restaurant is well-thought out.  Their bar is two-sided.  One side being for the patio, and the other side for the indoor bistro--kind of ingenious!  Let it be known, the bar does have draught beer on tap (Peroni, Blue Moon, Blue Moon Pumpkin, and a few others).  The wine menu is geared more towards everyday wines (most bottles under $50).  They have an assortment of reds, whites, blushes available by the glass and bottle.   Liquorwise, they are limited to basics, Bombay Sapphire, Three Olives Vodka, 1800, J.W. Black Label, Jack, etc.  So just remember when you order your cocktail, this is NOT an ultra lounge.  So don't be a snob just because they may not carry your favorite liquor, suck it up and try something different!  I had a blast at Grimaldi's, not because of the bottle of Riesling or bottle of Pinot Noir, but because of being surrounded by good food, good ambiance, good service, and great company!",

Just the right amount of tang, spice & salt.  Great restaurant design / layout      Bar is completly open to the outside      It's like being outdoors but without the melting 105 degree heat  BOOOO:  Eat your pizza immediately.        Looses texture when reheating        (reheated in microwave I'm sure it would have been better if we         had done it in the oven)   Pizza only        not an italian restaurant        no pasta, lasagna, parmigiana, etc.  SUMMARY A darn good New York pizza pie. Come on, we drove one 4 hours home w us. I think that says it all. This will become 1 of our Las Vegas food staples.",

The antipasto salad is also good - with mozzarella, oven roasted sweet red peppers, Genoa salami, olives, and bread. What I think is weird about this place is they don't have garlic bread. They do have a nice selection of beer and wine. The price isn't that fantastic, and the crust is too done, but I will be going back for my favorite pizza!",

Why don't they have butter by the way? None, at all. Didn't run out, they just don't supply it. Canoli, hard as rocks. Awesome food runner action , pizza was great too. Had reservations ,Told the server & whoever took the reservation this was a bday celebration but no love. BTW they asked ME what the occasion was when I booked 2 weeks earlier, So I assumed they asked so we could get at least a freakn candle on a piece of desert after spending 200 bucks, but nope. Also asked for coffee & the response was \"we don't have any\", wow, that hurt!  Yikes, scared me off, thats fo sho!

But this is only if you have never had a pizza from Grimaldi's before.   Their plain Margharita pizza is a thing of simple beauty. A crisp, slightly charred crust, with a delicious tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella cheese and a few sprigs of basil. So simple, so delicious!!!  The pizza may be a bit pricier than regular pizza joints, but you definitely get what you pay for and this is absolutely worth it!",

Didn't even try to listen to feedback, and was an unpleasant dining experience. Definitely not worth spending over $30 to dine out...money better spent on fast food pizza.

I always bring out-of-town guests here because I think the food is great and different from most pizza places.  This place is not close to where I live but I go out of my way to get pizza here and it's worth it.  Last night, the BF and I were meeting his aunt and uncle on that side of town, so I kindly offered to bring over some Grimaldi's. Yeah!  Pretty much always order the same thing, but last night I skipped the mediterannean sald I normally order and got two pizzas:  1. mush, meatball, kalmata olives 2. sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, kalmata olives  Seriously, if you like kalmata olives, make sure you get some on your pizza.  Before Grimaldi's I had never had them on a pizza.  Now I'm addicted.  I've tried the white pizza, but I'm not a fan of alfredo.  The pesto sauce is excellent, but I like red sauce on my pizzas.  I haven't even mentioned the staff.  Everyone is really cool and friendly.  I would probably still come here if the staff were a-holes, but fortunately, they're not!",

The manager came by and checked in with us while we ate, which was indeed a nice touch.

Red sauce, italian sausage, ricotta cheese & roasted red bell peppers. Heaven, no kidding.  And to think that I have never had a glassy of wine with my pizze before- my life was changed FOREVER!.  We started with the antipasto- while simple was divine, perfect combo of all things delicious!  Random fact: in the kitchen they have a chemist come in and match the pH and mineral content of the water to the water in new york- so that the food they make tasted the same. Who knew?  Finished off the meal with a slice of Bailey's and Cream cheesecake (also made fresh in the Grimaldi's kitchen).... to die for.  Thanks for changing my life :)",

It may be different but its not the best pizza in the world or maybe it just taste better to you because of the name and they charge you so much for a pizza. I grew up in Brooklyn around the block from a pizza shop and have had may fair share of pizza all over NYC. They must be making the dough different here and the guy maintaining the coal oven and pizza isn't trained properly or oven isn't good.  You are supposed to have a slight smokey coal char flavor, not charred pizza. This style of pizza is only good straight out of oven and has a totally different taste and texture when you take it home to eat or reheat. Its best to eat it there if they get it correct but I have dinned there twice and both times it wasn't great. One time it was flabby and second time it was charred. Service was mediocre",

As soon as we arrived they sat us immediately, but it took about 5-10 minutes before anyone could attend to us. We were looking around waiting for service when several employees passed by us without even acknowledging us. Clearly, we needed help. When our server finally approached us, he didn't even tell us his name (found out his name was Jeff, after looking at the check). Our salad came out quickly, but I was the only one at the table without silverware. It seemed that everything that we asked for took awhile. They didn't bring our drinks right away. I was halfway through my plate of salad when our drinks finally came out. Our whole table was done eating and our server didn't even come by to check on us. Had to wait longer for our check and our change. It wasn't even busy at all. If anything, the restaurant was already clearing out by this time. When we left, NONE of the employees bothered to greet us thank you or goodbye. Instead, I saw the employees chatting with each other.   Food - the food is great, but they should work on quicker and friendlier service. Oh and the tables are a little crammed.",

    "text": "Grimaldi's is my favorite place for pizza. The coal-fired brick oven makes a huge difference in the way the pizza tastes. Pizzas made at Grimaldi's are thin (my favorite kind) and they use large slices of mozzarella cheese, the best tasting pizza sauce (just the right amount of tomato, salt, and spices), and whatever toppings you prefer. I also order a delicious caesar salad with my meal every time. Every bite is like a piece of heaven in your mouth. Even pizza leftovers the next day taste awesome!   I fancy the bar layout because it has two sides, one inside and one outside for the patio. I had a house wine once, which was tasty. More recently, I order the Honeymoon beer draft, which I have yet to find elsewhere. Lots of drink selections are available, including some draft beers from local breweries.   The service here has been tremendous lately. I used to dislike the young and snotty hostesses, but I haven't seen them in months (hmm, i wonder why lol). The bartender was very friendly and social. She even let me try some draft beer from a local brewery.   Its about a 10 minute drive from my place, so I often go there more times than I should! They don't deliver, but take-out ordering is a painless procedure done at the cashier located at the bar. This place is hype-worthy. I've even gotten my g/f and parents hooked on Grimaldi's!",

    "text": "I only grabbed a pepperoni pizza for takeout, so I can't review the wait staff, but my goodness it was good.  I had been to the Summerlin location months ago for lunch where I split a salad and a white pizza with 4 friends.  It was incredible there and the pizza I ordered for takeout on Eastern was quite amazing as well.  A large 18\" 1 topping pizza was roughly $20.  Little pricey for a thin crust with only 1 topping, but the ingredients were top notch.  If you share a large pizza and salad with drink with 3 other friends you'll probably end up at roughly $10 a person  A large would probably feed 3-4 adults, and it's a very good thin crust pizza with slices of fresh mozzarella, small spicy bits of pepperoni and delicious sauce.  When I'm in the mood for a thick crust, Rosati's makes a great Chicago style, but when I'm in the mood for a good East coast style pizza, Grimaldi's has impressed both me and my friends twice now.",

    "text": "Went to Grimaldi's because of the high marks in Yelp.   On vacation with relatives, we went in with a party of 13 including a 6-year-old, two 4-year-olds, and a 1-year-old. Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.  Asked for a kid menu - \"no.\" Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - \"no, only pizza.\" Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a \"Hawaiian\" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - \"uhhh, yeah, we don't have that.\" WTH?  The left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a \"vegetarian\", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?  We ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's \"extra cheese\" pizza! haha  The white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, \"yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing.\" It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.  If we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell.",

    "text": "Grimaldi's is definitely one of my go-tos in the area. It falls into the \"night out\" category for me instead of the \"pizza to go\" category. The ambiance inside is nice and the service is pretty good, so you feel ok sitting in there and hanging out for a while with a couple beers and a pie, unlike, say, Giovanni's up the road.  Main point: I really like the pizza. Nice thin crust, so you don't feel like you're taking in 3000 calories (I'm not saying you're not....you may be...it just doesn't feel like it). The cheese is (I think) mozzarella, so it has a really good flavor that is different from your typical take out place. All the toppings are really good and seem pretty high quality. The side salads are also really good.  One star off for the high prices and (like others have noted) the fact that you can't order a specialty pizza. Instead, you have to get a large ($18 for cheese I think) and then add on your toppings at $2-4 each. If you get 4 or 5 toppings, you're looking at like $30+ for a pizza. But hey, that's another reason why I say this is a \"night out\" place and not a \"pizza to go\" place.",

    "text": "OK, so I was talking up Grimaldi's given I visited the one under the Brooklyn Bridge last summer and was blown away by their pizza. A buddy of mine from back east (Philly) was visiting and I told him that there's a Grimaldi's off Eastern and 215 in Las Vegas. We visited the place last night around 5:30PM.  We ordered an 18\" light sauce pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms. We waited 15 minutes and the pie appeared. We were starving so we dug in. My bud says...\"so where's the extra chesse\"? and he was right. Not only was there NO extra cheese, there practically NO cheese on the pizza. I called over our waitress she brought over the order slip and sure enough she ordered extra cheese/light sauce.   English must be a second language for the oven/kitchen staff. Our waitress sent over the Manager and he apologized and said ....\"don't worry, I'll take care of this\" while holding the bill. We said great! We tipped our waitress and started to walk out when the Manager said...oh, wait guys, you still have to pay for half of the pie.  Will somebody PLEASE tell this guy when you say....\"I'm gonna take care of this (bill)\" it means the whole bill ......not HALF.  We did get a $5 voucher for a future visit and so I will return and hope for a better outcome.  July 3rd UPDATE!!! Visited the Grimaldi's on Rampart; tried to use the $5 voucher, and.......wait for it.......the voucher date expired three months ago. Yup, the manager gave us an expired voucher. All in all I'm gonna pass on any Grimaldi's Pizza in Las Vegas and wait until I get back to Brooklyn.",

    "text": "This is my absolute favourite pizza in Las Vegas, hands-down, despite the fact that it is a bit more expensive than I'd usually prefer for a pizza place.    Crispy thin crust, the sauce is flavourful but there's not too much of it -- no soggy pizza for me!  They have a wide array of toppings -- I usually go for ricotta which is to die for, fresh garlic, fresh sliced tomato and basil (the tomato and basil's best when it goes on after it's cooked).  Yes, their italian sausage, pepperoni, roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes are awesome but I like to keep it simple.  They've got a nice wine list -- whether you want something pricey or just the house red you'll be happy.  Also, if you're a fan of caesar salad, make sure you try theirs.  It's not dripping with dressing like you'll find at a lot of places!  The downsides... It's a small restaurant and can get very cramped so if you're coming with a big group, anyone with mobility issues or small children I would highly recommend not coming at peak dinner time.  Also, there is one waitress there who is just unpleasant.  All the rest of the staff are wonderful from the bartenders to the hostesses up to management... I don't know what her problem is but every single time I've been there she's made it clear that she does NOT want to be there.  But overall, all of the pluses make up for one bad apple in the bunch.",

The char on the pie is just perfect and gives that smoke flavor I love. The cheese, of course, fresh and there is just enough to mix with the light sauce that makes it a perfect pie!!  The staff is always friendly and I love how you can watch the pizzaiolos tossing the dough in the air and working the peel when the pizzas are in the oven.  It is always a very clean restaurant including the bathrooms. I do not drink but the bar is loaded with everything imaginable and the very attentive waiters are always checking on you.  Overall great family experience for us, and I highly recommend eating a coal-fired pizza from Grimaldi's, you will not regret it.",

We  then both had a piece of the Reese's peanut butter cheese cake! Out of this world! The point of this whole review is to commend our server, Amanda. Living in the Las Vegas area, it's unusual to find a server who actually cares about her customers, and to find one who is pleasant and who apologizes for making us wait (which she didn't, really, we were enjoying ourselves). Amanda is the type of employee that I'm sure every restaurant wishes they had. And we hope Grimaldi's appreciates her. Thanks, Amanda, for making our dinner a very pleasant experience.",

    "text": "My friend and I were driving around trying to find something to eat. We came across Grimaldi's and decided to give it a shot. We were not disappointed in the least.  We came at the end of lunch so it was pretty empty. We were greeted by a lovely lady who sat us down and went over the menu with us after we said it was our first time.  Our server came by shortly after and once again went over the menu with us. Menu is definitely short and sweet into the point. He walked us through the beverage menu and we ordered a couple of sangrias.   A few minutes later my friend ordered one small pizza for herself and I ordered one for myself as well. We decided to share a small house salad also. We were surprised by his reaction when we ordered two small pizzas. As soon as they came out we knew why.  The pizzas are huge for being small. And the price that you pay for them is pretty phenomenal. I chose to start off with a traditional white pizza. White sauce with mozzarella and garlic and I had a bacon and pepperoni. She went with the margarita pizza. Both were 5/5.  My pizza came out first and unfortunately then put it in wrong. But both the manager and the server apologized. He told me I could have add it but that my pizza that I ordered was coming right behind it. I finished two slices of the mistaken pizza and it was phenomenal. My friend had two slices of her own.   When my pizza, the one that I originally ordered, came out it was worth the wait. Had two slices of that one. We were completely stuffed. The service was impeccable. Very attentive. Everybody was surprised that we never been there before.  At the end of the meal they brought us out a complementary Oreo cheesecake. Cheesecakes are made in house. That was also a 5/5.   We ate most of the cheesecake and got boxes for our pizzas. We had leftovers for about two days. I have to say that the attentiveness and the level of customer service of this place made it go from a 10 to a 10+.  I love the East Coast since my family is from there and you got a real East Coast five. Everything from the subway station signs to the friendliness of the staff. I will definitely be back here.",

Eastern Avenue location I was appalled by our experience on Sat. 8/22/15 at approx. 7:30 p.m. There was a table of 3 men and a woman. One man was drunk and disorderly. So much so, that a nearby table of adults with young children cancelled their order and left because of their foul language. Myself and my guest were likewise offended. One of the men at the table was permitted to enter and dine in bare feet, which was repulsive.   I called for the manager to ask that he take appropriate action. His comment was \"I've already spoken to them and there was nothing more I could do.\" I mentioned to him about the man being permitted to dine in bare feet and that being a health issue and potentially liability should he step on glass or other foreign matter. He just shrugged his shoulders and said \"I'm sorry.\"   This manager was approximately 6'3\" and 250 lbs. and seemed frightened to confront and order them to leave. I heard from some of the other dinners and they too were appalled and disgusted that the \"manager\" just let these unruly persons ruin their dinner as well. This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and will think twice before returning to that location.",

Portion's were good, actually more than we could eat. We brought half home along with a dessert trio of a cannoli, cheese cake and tiramasu. These portions however were small and expensive in my opinion. Pizza was thin crusted with a nice crush  Calzone was my favorite  I asked to have more ricotta then mozzarella ( I don't like to chew and chew mozzarella! Anyhoo. Try it, you'll like it!",

I don't remember our server's name but she was awesome for recommending popular items, having great social skills, being quick and attentive as well as being patient. Omg and the Oreo cheesecake was yummy! If you haven't checked this place out, you're completely missing out!",

I always seem bothered that they don't serve wings or garlic bread until I eat a piece of their pizza and forget all about everything else. Grimaldi's does pizza right.   We ordered two pizzas, one with pepperoni and basil and the other with artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, basil and roasted garlic. Both equally tasty. I love that they use full slices of mozzarella and not shreds. It makes the pizza more authentic. We also ordered a caprese salad with fresh basil, mozzarella and thick slices of tomato.   For take-out or dine in, Grimaldi's is on my top list of great pizza.",

The flavor that the coal oven gives the crust is one of the factors that makes them a contender in the new round of reviews for Las Vegas Best Pizza dot com.  This location gets very busy around 4pm when they stoke the fire. It is bwst to enjoy their pizza dining in as tge crispness of the crust degenerates by the minute on take-out, as it steams in the box. Toppings are always fresh and they have actually stepped up their recipes since the last round of reviews for the site.  Their outdoor seating give you a chance to smell the exhaust from the pizzas cooking in that coal oven, something you cant get anywhere else in Vegas, other than Grimaldi's.  Worth the price and worth the wait. After 30+ visits to get an across-the-board average, they are definitely up there with the front-runners now.",

    "text": "Worsttttttttt pizza experience in my life! Take \"Brooklyn\" off your box! Brooklyn pizza is good, this was a pizza fail!! Over an hour wait for burnt pizza? My full review will soon to follow!!! ----That was just the tip^^---  I was going to wait to review this place, but I can't. I'm so infuriated I could scream. We walked into Grimaldi's (Mind you, this was my very first time here) and while we were approaching the hostess, I saw her roll her eyes at my kids. LISTEN-- If you can't handle the service industry... BEAT IT! I worked every role in the restaurant business for years, including upper management. That's not how your greet guests. (Especially ones that Yelp!!) The night was NOT starting off well at all.   She asks us \"how many?\" and said that there was a 25 minute wait. That was fine for us. We told her that we didn't mind eating outside if that helped. She QUICKLY replies \"There's NO room to sit outside\".... Really? I see two open tables and a large table of 6-8 people with to-go boxes on their laps. She obviously didn't want to take another table.   Now I'm irritated. I hate liars. I hate mean people, and I hate LAZY employees!    We got sat about 10 minutes later. Our waiter, \"AJ\" was nice, he took our app and drink orders. Not to my surprise he screws that up. We ordered red sangria, he brought white. It wasn't a big deal, but I was already annoyed from all the prior attitude. We really should have left, but the kids were hungry and it's a school night.  We quickly order two pizzas and crossed our fingers that our night was about to get better.   ... Little did we know that it would get worse...  AJ, our waiter, came back a few minutes later with a red sangria in hand, apologizing for the confusion. (Ok, good work there)  After that we sat there for another hour, watching all of the tables (that arrived after us) get served their pizza! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? An hour for pizza? The waiter kept saying  that it was coming. Our kids were hungry, getting antsy and I was really annoyed.   The manager came over and said our pizza was just about up. My husband told him what happened and how we have been sitting for an hour. What did the manager reply? He said we've only been there for 25 minutes!!! HOW DARE YOU?? I said \"Really? here's my Yelp and FB check-ins showing the timestamps\"...... He knew he was caught out there and said our pizzs was next and he'd try to help work out the bill. ----GEE Thanks. You basically call my husband and I liars, make your business look horrible, then just \"try' to make up for it? I told my husband I wanted to leave. We only stayed because we were curious what was going to happen next.   Another 5-7 minutes go by, and our pizza arrives. Just ONE of them lol. I explained to the waiter that I am a Brooklyn born Italian and NO freaking pizza is worth an hour wait. He didn't really have much of a reaction.  Our second Pizza came another 2 minutes later. I take a bite... and to complete the WORST pizza story EVER.... IT WAS BURNT! Not crispy, not well done, outright pitch black burnt. It tasted like charcoal. We told the waiter we were done and over it and wanted to leave.   He brings over the bill, the manager took $33.50 off of the $95.00 bill.   We paid and left.  NEVER EVER AGAIN! First and last time.   (Burnt pizza picture was posted in my profile. YUCK)",

On Sunday, I go during the evenings and sit at the bar. They always have football on during the season and the bartender for Sunday evening shifts is great.

Its crust was a nice thin and crisp situation that did not get soggy at any time, thus making it better than what I got from nearby Novecento. And I'm going to say that the cheese and sauce were good but not as good as the also-nearby Montesano's Eateria - but Montesano's had a thicker, breadier crust that interfered too much with the other ingredients in my opinion.  Staff were friendly, water tasted clean, and ambiance was nice. We came in during a slow time, so it wasn't busy or loud, but I can see how it would get very busy and very loud during dinner.",

    "text": "We really had a tough time deciding whether to give this two or three stars. We thought two was too cruel, but the food just wasn't above average enough to merit three stars. Unfortunately, two-and-a-half stars wasn't an option on Yelp.   We recently moved to Vegas/Henderson. After all the buzz we'd heard and great reviews we'd read, we finally decided to give Grimaldi's (9595 S Eastern) a try for our first Vegas-area pizza experience. We were very disappointed.   This was probably the first pizza we'd ever ordered where we didn't take the leftovers home. We ate half a large between us, and had them toss the rest.   We noticed all the waitstaff were overselling the pizza and telling everyone who came in that it was the best pizza in town. In our humble opinion, the pizza should speak for itself. Sorry, but if this is the \"best pizza in town,\" then this town must have the worst pizza in the world.   The worst part was the crust. It was like a bland water cracker with black burned marks on the edges. It was dry, crispy, and flavorless. The pizza was kind of like a Carr's Table Wafer with a few toppings on it. In fact the pizza was so dry that The Mrs. ordered an extra side of marinara in an attempt to make it more palatable. Unfortunately this pizza was beyond hope. Even with the extra mozzarella The Mrs. had ordered, there still was barely enough cheese.   It was so thin that the waiter didn't even need a potholder to carry the pizza out. Two minutes after it hit the table it was cold. Perhaps if there had been some pizza and toppings it would have stayed warm longer.   We also noticed pictures of New York City all over the walls. Calling it a \"New York\" style or \"East Coast\" style pizza doesn't make it good. Maybe it was modeled after a really bad New York pizza. I'm from the East Coast (Boston), and have been to New York many times. There are a lot of different kinds of pizza available on the East Coast. My favorites were ooey, gooey, and had a flavorful chewy crust. Whether the crust is thick or thin, it's the texture that makes the difference. This Grimaldi's pizza crust had no texture or chewiness. It tasted as plain as a burnt cracker. The skimpy cheese and sauce didn't help either.   Others may differ, but personally I do not like black burnt portions on my pizza. Even the best pizza can get burned spots. I don't know if this happens from the oven being too hot or from an improper mixture in the crust. I've experienced this on many different pizzas and I'm just not a fan of it. Some people don't seem to mind it, and even the best pizza can occasionally suffer a burned spot and still be good, so I've come to accept it. It's still a negative for me, although not a deal-breaker. If that was the only issue with the Grimaldi's pizza, I wouldn't give it such a low rating. In this case, the black spots on the crust edges were just insult added to injury.   Perhaps this would be good for someone who likes dry pizza. This was about the driest pizza we've ever eaten. Sorry, but we just don't like dry pizza.   On the plus side, the waitstaff was very nice. Also, our small side salad was huge and delicious. They also had a pretty nice wine selection.",

    "text": "It's just good.  Quality ingredients do make some tasty pizzas.  I recently discovered Grimaldi's and I think it's about to become one of my go-to dinner destinations.  It's a bit on the pricey side for the pie - it's not the place if you're looking for a cheap date - but when you're in the mood to gab with your friends over wine, beer, salads, and thin crust pizza, check this place out.  The salads are meant to be shared.  I like the feel of that.  I do love a good salad, but the pizza is what drew me back after my first visit.  The crust is nice and thin, with a slight chewy bite.  It's often a little charred around the edges, which I adore.  The cheese is thinly sliced fresh mozzarella.  It's subtle, with a hint of sweet, and even though mozz generally lacks flavor, there is something about this chewy white melty cheesy goodness that makes me say \"mmm\".  I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.  Plus, they feature some local brews.  I enjoyed my pie with a Tenaya nut brown tonight.  Yay for supporting locals!  I think the biggest drawback is the lack of price breaks for topping combos.  Four toppings can cost you the price of the base pie, yowzahs.  At this Eastern Ave location there is some lovely outdoor seating (although I can think of better ambiance than Eastern Ave, but you can only ask for so much here in Hendertucky), and I find the indoor ambiance rather pleasant.  I've experienced nothing but friendly service.  It's a great place to grab a bite and a drink with a friend, and you'll leave with satisfied tastebuds and your stomach not overflowing with grease.",

The decor is contemporary NY pizza parlor with a friendly host to hold the door open for you. I loved the half inside/half outside bar concept, but sadly with it being over 100 degrees at 8pm, I didnt think I could pass up the AC inside.   The staff were all friendly and you could even spot the managers on the floor (no they dont do table touches haha). The menu was so small its amazing, but if you want a good thin crust pizza, it serves it purpose. I was incredibly impressed with the flavor and size of it and would def. recommend it to all you thin crust lovers out there.",

    "text": "My fiance and I have trouble deciding where we want pizza from when picking between this place and Settebello! Honestly if it was just about pizza I'd say Settebello has the edge , but it's not a huge edge!!  As for Grimaldi's, here's how I see it:  Pros: *Cool vibe with a nice patio! Feels much more fun to dine here than Settebello. *Various sizes of pizza! I have issues at Settebello because the only size they serve is just a tad too big for me.... then I overeat because I can't leave the last piece on my plate etc...or then I waste some... I prefer to order a slighly larger pie at Grimaldi's and split it! Much more cost effective and no wasted pizza and overeating. *better drink menu *They spread the cheese out! No huge globs of cheese.. the yummy cheese is spread out perfectly.  Cons: *Crust is slightly better at Settebello's *Ummm salame... can't find that here! In general I think toppings are a little better over at Settebello, but not by much.   Honestly we alternate between the two places depending on our mood. They are both awesome.",

We walked in and the atmosphere was very welcoming, and the service was absolutely fantastic. The restaurant was clean, and the design was modern and smart. It was casual, yet tasteful.   The waitress guided us through the menu. We started with a salad (I'm pretty sure it was the house salad), but it was only mediocre. The vinegarette dressing was too overpowering and it just had a salty, acidic taste to it. Then we ordered with a pizza; half sausage, half mushroom. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy, and the mozerella and other ingredients were oh so fresh.   Once we took our first bites, woah damn, there was no stopping us! Now, the three of us almost never agree on how good a food is, but we all agreed that that pizza was the best any of us had ever eaten. We're a pretty tough group to please when it comes to food, but even my dad said it was incredible delicious. And my brother, who just thinks everything is ok, love love loved it.   Would I recommend this to a friend? Child please, I would recommend this restaurant to the whole world- including my enemies.",

Like I said, pizza was delicious, nice sauce, crunchy, chewy crust, I was in pizza heaven. If they had one near my house, I'd get pizza every week.  The restaurant was nearly empty, yet when another couple came in, they sat them at the table right next to us.  My chair was touching the chair of the guy behind me.  I know, they need to squeeze in all the tables they can, but seriously, you have an empty restaurant and you pick to seat them right there?  Most of the antipasto was good, the roasted red peppers were excellent, the mozzarella, ok, but the salami was disappointing, it was ok, but was generic, grocery store salami.  We had 2 pieces of pizza, and some red peppers, olives and cheese left from the antipasto, so I told the waitress I wanted them to go, and she asked if the same box was ok.  I said yes, thinking the roasted red peppers and cheese would be put on a piece of wax paper or something so they weren't touching the cardboard.  Nope, just plopped right in the cardboard sucking up cardboard taste.  C'mon use a little common sense.  If you sign up for their email list, they'll send you a $5 off coupon.",

The pepperonis are not the giant circle's most people are used to. They are nice, small disks. Not over powering but taste yummy. The pizza has just the right amount of cheese and sauce. I had the pesto there as well which was very flavorful.  You can order a small or large pie for the table or a personal pizza for yourself.  The service is fast and efficient.  Pizza done right should not take too long.  I live in NJ and know about good pizza.  To have a Grimaldi's on the West Coast is a blessing.  My parents could never find good pizza out there.  Next is Chinese food. And yes, this kicks Setebellos butt!  Cafe Rio is next door, that's extra points!",

    "text": "I came to this place last Wednesday for dinner. Me and my friend have never been here before and we have heard good things about Grimaldi's, so, we decided to give it a try. We ordered the large pesto pizza with itallian sausage on one half of the pie. My friend had a water to drink and I tried the passion fruit iced tea.    Now the atmosphere is nice with the lighting a little on the darker side for a nice reaxing feel to it. Now I wasn't to keen on the drink I ordered so I just asked if I could switch it out with a Pepsi or Coke instead. That wasnt a problem. But while my friend and I were waiting for our pizza we were talking and trying to conversate. Unfortunately we were sat right next to the kitchen where they were making all the food, and as my friend was talking, I could barely hear her or make out was she was saying because of the banging noises and cooking that was going on right next to us. I'm sure any other table would have been fine, but because we were sitting adjacent to where the noise is, I was just annoyed a little bit about that.    When we did get our pizza though, it was definitely delectably delicious (LOL try saying that three times fast). It was a nice NY style thin crust pizza that me and my friend enjoyed very much. Is it the best pizza ever? Naw, not to me. The secret pizza place in the Cosmo is a better NY style pizza joint in vegas to me. But, I did enjoy Grimaldi's Pizza and I will definitely come back again. I had the Pesto so I'll try the White with garlic next time i come here.    The only other real minor complaint I had was that I never got a refill on my beverage. I left my glass at the end of the table so they could see that it was empty, and our waitress never noticed it until we were already done eating. And by that time, I didnt even want a refill anymore because that would be a waste of soda. I guess that's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. You don't need to come by every 5 mins, but you should come by and check on the guests every so often to see if they need anything. Customer service is just as important, if not more important than the food the restaurant is serving.",

Yes small because the pies are huge.  This pizza place has several locations over the united states.  They charcoal bake the pies to perfection.  The ingredients are fresh, and I mean fresh! The mozzarella is to die for. We have been to other pizza places and we always seem to compare them to this place.  You get a lot of people that say no way the pizza is better at blah blah city, but we are in Las Vegas not New York!  So what are you waiting for try this place out and if you are disappointed, then either something is seriously wrong with you or you have no pulse.

I went here with 3 other people and was excited. They had the outside bar open (why the hell you would want to sit outside in 100+ degrees, I don't know). The waiter was hilarious, and very lucky that I love all kinds of humor and sarcasm. Most people would've found him to be offensive.  I loved the fact that they cook the pizzas in a traditional brick oven and hand toss their pizza dough.  The bread with olive oil/pepper/balsamic vinegar was rather horrible. I attribute it to the crappy olive oil and subpar bread (I hate to say it, but Macaroni Grill has the best). Something as simple as that turns me off. We ordered two pizzas, each half and half. I had pepperoni, garlic, basil on the side, and fresh tomatoes. The basil was not fresh, it was brown and bitter.  Something very important to know about their pizza is that their \"pizza sauce\" has NO SPICES whatsoever. It's plain ol' tomato. That's why it's important to get the extra toppings. That's how they make their money. Each topping is $2+. I'm sorry, but I love my spices.  Hop on the 215 and get over to Joe's NY pizza by the Outlet Mall. THAT is pizza.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of 6 people around 6:30pm on Tuesday night and the place was already pretty packed. Luckily there were a couple of open tables for us, since we didn't have a reservation, which I would recommend if you don't get there early because the line of people waiting for tables got longer and longer while we were there enjoying our meal. In fact when we left around 8pm, there was still a line.  We started with your standard pepperoni and sausage pizza, and then we ordered a specialty white pizza (I can't remember the name), which is supposed to taste like a cheese steak. I liked the pepperoni and sausage pizza better than the specialty one. Although it did taste pretty good, I think that there was way too much cheese on top and it made the pizza taste a little dry and marshmallow-y.  After finishing two large pizzas, it still was not enough. So we ordered a pesto pizza with chicken and garlic. This pizza tasted really good and had tons of chicken on it and maybe just a little too much pesto. The pizzas here are thin crust, and it's a lot easier to fold each slice to eat it. I really liked that there was a bit of a crunch to the crust.  So our waitress was a little too anxious to clear our plates. I think this might be because they were so busy and probably wanted to try to clear the tables quicker so they could seat the people waiting for a table. She did check up on us often to make sure we had enough food and that everything was ok.   Now here is where the 5 stars comes in. One of the guys in our group couldn't finish his slice of pizza, so he asked her to box it up for him. As we were about to leave, he asked her if she had the pizza. When she went back to the kitchen to get it, apparently someone had thrown it out instead of boxing it up for our friend. She informed the manager about what happened and the manager offered to either make a personal size pizza for our friend, or give us a complimentary slice of cheesecake.  Of course we took the cheesecake and got the plain cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was heavenly!",

Food was great.  Not quite the Brick Oven style that I am used to coming from Hawaii.  The only downfall was no bacon.  Every pizza place should have a bacon option.",

They have a full bar in the restaurant. The only negative aspect is that they don't deliver, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because if they did, I would certainly be 100 lbs heavier. Delish!",

After some serious shopping at the only Nordstrom Rack in the entire Las Vegas/ Henderson we finally got a chance to see what all the fuss is about.  They weren't very busy but we came around 2pm on Sunday, between lunch and dinner.  I like the outdoor area with the bar, they also had the games on but some guy was smoking a strong cigar so we opted to go inside.  They seated us right away but our server didn't even come around until 5 minutes later so I already thought we made a bad choice.  But our waitress was very helpful especially after we told her it was our first time.  The small salads can serve up to 2 people and are all made with a red wine vinaigrette except the Caesar salad.  They have set prices for plain cheese pizza with different sauces and sizes and additional toppings are about $2 each.  We ordered a small house salad- lettuce,red peppers, mushrooms green olives and red onion. There was a lot of dressing but thats the way I like it!  We also ordered a small red sauce pizza with fresh garlic, ricotta and Italian sausage.  When it arrived they stretched it to a large! This was the best pizza we've had in Vegas- ricotta was very creamy and they didn't hold back on the toppings.  Overall we spend just about $30.  We will definitely go back when we are on this side of town since I heard the Summerlin one just isn't as good.",

We decided to order a half pesto/half white with garlic sauce to eat after the club. I wonder how well this pizza would taste 8 hours after ordering it because I remember the pizza being soggy when I ate it cold in NY. However this pizza held up. Definitely tasted better hot, but it actually held up pretty well eating it cold.  We also tried the Bailey cheesecake. It's an amazing dessert. Strongly recommend it if you have extra stomach space. It's still mostly cheesecake with a chocolate crust. It's lightly flavored with Bailey, awesome dessert.",

Also, there is a bar where you can sit either inside or out (there's a large rolling shutter that opens up).  Oh & there is absolutely no gaming.  If you ask me, that's a major plus!  As mentioned a small menu, but how many choices do you need with pizza that tasty?  We shared a small pizza- 1/2 pesto 1/2 white with meatballs, sausage, ricotta & roasted red peppers.  I preferred the pesto pizza, a lot more flavor & zestiness.  It was just crispy enough too.  Not too charred on the bottom, which is what I don't like about wood-fired or coal oven pizza.  It was really quite good.   I can't wait to go back & try the calzones.  I may have to join the gym first, as I see me being very addicted to this place...  Update 6/3/08: The calzones rock.

We couldn't come up with a good reason to drag a baby out to dinner when her bedtime was just minutes away, so my nephew suggested pizza.  He mentioned it was New York pizza, and I expected that generic sort of Ray's slice, dripping with grease, but redolent of home.  Wow, was I impressed!  We had red pepper and onion, and sun-dried tomato and something...I'm not a sun dried tomato fan.   Nephew asked if it had my seal of approval, and I mentioned it tasted like Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.   Then he showed me the box.  I was in heaven.  Only downside was, we were staying at a hotel with no refrigerator that I could cram the leftovers in.  I would have happily had a slice cold, for breakfast the next day.  I can't wait for another road trip now!  There's nothing in San Diego that can compare to these pies!",

Friends of mine who lived in Vegas wanted to take me to Grimaldi's while I was in town last month. I have to say I was impressed!! We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night and it was busy, so busy I thought there would be at least a 20-30 minute wait but I was wrong we got a table right away. Our table was located right in front of the kitchen were the guys were making the pizza's. When I sat down and saw the brick-oven pizza's coming out of the oven I knew I was in for a treat!! They were thin crusted topped with fresh ingredients and a brickoven/coal bottom.   We started off with the cold antipasti platter. Italian meats, cheeses, olives and fresh foccacia bread. Your typical cold antipasti platter, you can't go wrong.   For dinner we ordered a Large pizza; half with pesto, pepperoni and onions and the other half; tomato sauce, sausage, mushrooms, artichokes and olives. They both were great! I would have to say the tomato, veggies and sausage side was my favorite however I really enjoyed the mini peperoni's that were on the other size, usually its large slices of pepperoni.   Grimaldi's also has a great wine selection. Since my friends are regulars the server was kind enough to offer me help on selecting a glass of white wine and even brought me out a few samples!   The restaurant is a fun, casual atmosphere with bar half inside and half outside with outside seating. Perfect for a warm but cool Vegas night! I would definitely recommend checking this place out!",

    "text": "My favorite place to eat New York Style pizza on the West Coast so far.  I can't compare it to Brooklyn but its still delicious.  Must be the water in New York!  Food: I stick to the standard pepperoni pizza.  The crust is nice, crisp and has a  perfect saltiness to it.  If it sits there too long, it does get soggy so try to eat it when its still hot and fresh.  They don't overdue it on the sauce and cheese so you can taste all the ingredients in each bite.   I did try the other types of meat like meatballs and sausage on the pizza.  It was quite tasty but it just wasnt the same as a plain pepperoni pizza.   Atmosphere: Nothing fancy.  Nice and clean.    Service: Never had any problems.  Everyone seemed nice and helpful",

    "text": "A little \"slice\" (pun intended) of NY in Vegas! This is some tasty pizza and highly customizable, great for splitting with friends. Lots of selection if you don't happen to be in the mood for a triangular piece of heaven.   I've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The slightly crunchy thin crust pizza is cooked perfectly each time; it's great but not super filling or overwhelming like some pizza can be. From peppers to pineapple they have any topping you desire. They use fresh mozzarella on the pizza so it's not oozing with a thick layer of cheese (a positive in my book), rather there are spots of cheese all around the pizza. The salads are enormous and wonderful. My favorite is the Caprese. You'll definitely want to share one of those bad boys.   The outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is right and the indoor seating feels like an Italian grandmother's kitchen, dough flying through the air and pizza ovens hard at work. There's also a little bar with TV's you can plant yourself at as well. The staff is very nice and attentive. A great outing for lunch or dinner!",

    "text": "My friend has raved about this \"Grimaldi's place for quite a while.  He goes for lunch a couple times a month and I've always said \"I'll try it sometime.\"  Part of the problem was that it's right by my favorite Mexican fast food place, Cafe Rio.  Well, tonight we finally tried the famous Grimaldi's and I'll tell you what, this is a \"I'll go on a diet tomorrow\" kind of restaurant.    We were the leading edge of the dinner crowd so no problem getting preferred seating indoors.  Quick attention by Anthony, our capable, informative and entertaining server.  When we declared our \"first time visitor\" status, he patiently explained the three different styles of pizza, the salads, and \"Oh, yes, we have calzone too!\"   We settled on a split medium, 1/2 ham/pepperoni and 1/2 pesto & jalapeno & basil (can you tell which one is the meat eater?).  Anthony wisely paired our selection with a Pinot Noir from Italy that matched perfectly.  So much so, we trusted him and got the bottle to finish at the castle (home).  Pizza is like sex, it's never bad unless you don't give it a chance.  And in this case, this was one of THE BEST PIZZA's I've ever had.  Timely, crisp, tasty, aromatic (and perfectly matching wine) and absolutely hit the spot.  I declared early that I would save room for Bailey's oreo cookie crust cheese cake.  I almost faltered and finished my 1/2 of the pizza which would have left me too stuffed.  But, I exhibited massive amounts of discipline and saved one slice for later consumpiton and ordered the heralded cheesecake (with two forks 'cuz I'm that kind of date).  Oh My GOSH!!!  This stuff should be on the front page of the Review Journal.  Seriously!  I'm not a big fan of sweets, but I can appreciate a near perfect taste when given the chance.  Presentation = 10, texture = 10, taste = 10 and memory = 10.  Well done, Grimaldi's!!  Before we left, we had the chance to give our thanks and kudos to Gino for having such an awesome place.  So maybe it took three years to finally try this place, it won't take very long before our next visit.  Well done everyone!",

Sounds defective to me. Pizza was too thin and expensive, I understand the concept of thin pizza just don't charge loaded deep dish prices please!  It is clean and a lot of people did seem to like the place, but it didn't fly for us. Canned mushrooms at extra cost? Canned?! The Stromboli had almost nothing in it. Service was not over the top, you may have to wait just to get seated here. The parking lot can fill up quickly too as there are a lot of little places in this section.  The main thing here were the prices, much too high for the amount of food. Everything seems to have an upcharge. It is good just not the best. In our opinion we expected more NYC kick.. but nope,  we got more of a tourist trap Vegas... :(  Enough people seem to like it so give it a shot and make your own decision.",

Very Good.  My family always orders the white garlic with  pesto, chicken and mushroom.  It does not have tomato sauce which my son doesn't like.  Every order is like that, pick up or dine in.  The dine-in experience is excellent. The waiters are mindful of who they are waiting on and my glass is never left empty.  I do consider Grimaldi's the best pizza in the area.  If I have a non-thin crust pizza craving, traditional pizza at Angelina's is option.  For the deep dish pan pizza, BJ's is available across the street.  But Grimaldi's Pizza is very good.",

Tonight, my salad didn't come out before the pizza and our waiter realized it had not come out, immediately the general manager (who is top notch) came over and apologized and made it right. The customer service here and DELICIOUS pizza is what keeps us coming back!",

My personal favorite meat is the spicy chicken sausage and getting the fresh basil thrown on at the end after everything is cooked is out of this world! The salads are huge, and fresh so keep that in mind when ordering, as the small house salad can easy feed two. I am usually not a huge dessert person, but I can never resist ordering the Oreo cheese cake at the end. It's the best way to top off a great dinner, and I do not believe I could ever get tired of eating here!",

    "text": "Parking (3/5): Parking is pretty good during non-rush hour, but it can be difficult to find one when they are busy. Also, they do share their parking space with Cafe Rio and a dessert place.   Ambiance (5/5): This restaurant has the perfect ambiance of a NYC pizzeria. It's always busy and customers are always chatty. It's loud and during some game nights patrons at the bar area can get bit loud. But as I said before, it reminds me a lot best pizzerias in NYC.   Service (5/5) Service is excellent at this Grimaldi's; from waiters to bartender, you are treated with a smile. They would also make proper suggestions on if you trying to venture into exotic toppings area. They keep their pizza in the oven if you running late to pick it up, which keeps the pizza hot and fresh until you get home. This is the best way to do a takeout.     Food (5/5) This is the best pizzeria I've been to in Henderson or LV. I believe that this might be the best Grimaldi's location in NV. Every time I'm craving a pizza I come here to get my favorite custom pizza. I get their large pizza with marinara, pesto sauce (w/ olive oil), meatballs, and extra cheese. It usually lasts me for 2 days and tastes exactly same when you re-heat it the next day in an oven. Other item that I love to eat at this place is their caprese salad; it's fresh, flavourfull and light. Their cheese is not to chewy and it literally dissolved in your mouth. My mouth is watering just writing about it.  Their desserts are excellent as well, I would highly recommend blueberry cheesecake.   Overall (5/5), I think that this is the best pizzeria for me until I've been to other famous places in LV for proper comparison. If you can look over minor parking issues then you will love this place.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely wonderful. My wife started with a carafe of wine called Drops Of Jupiter.. She loved it (ended up getting some at Total Wine after dinner) and I had the house Bloody Mary, which uses pizza sauce instead of tomato juice, and garnished with pepperoni, cherry tomato, basil, and olives, VERY good. We started with Antipasto which was excellent!  For our pizza order, she had the gluten free Margherita, and I had the Margherita minus the basil, add kalamata olives. Now, mind you.. we are becoming pizza snobs, and are now on a mission to try the best of the best in Las Vegas. It will take a LOT to knock this pizza out of the top place, in my books. Not only was the pizza out of this world, the ambience, even being on a busy Friday night was just what we were hoping for. The service we received from Chelsea was impeccable!!!!  She was beyond helpful, and just a real sweetheart!  We will be asking for her every time we go back, without hesitation. I truly cannot think of anything bad to say about this place. To those of you who are saying this pizza wasn't good, it was too thin, it was too this, too that....  I'm telling you right now, Dominos, and Papa Johns..... IS NOT REAL PIZZA!!!!!  Say that over, and over in your head until you start to understand it.   We finished the evening with dessert, which is something that we NEVER do, and boy am I glad we did!  We shared a piece of butterscotch toffee cheesecake, and it did not disappoint one bit!  Paired that with a cup of amazing cappuccino, and I was one happy, happy man. Now, the food is not terribly cheap, but I have zero problem paying good money for good food, and even better service, and that's just what we got. I've paid more for worse food, and worse service.   If you happen to read this Chelsea, please know that we thoroughly  enjoyed our night, thanks to you and Grimaldi's. And we will take your advice and come back on a weeknight when it's less busy!  And the little tip about the certain time of day to get the best tasting pizza, we'll keep that to ourselves :-) Thank you again, and we'll see you real soon!",

You get a lot more choice here than many other small family owned chains. + Nice atmosphere. From the woodtype stove to the NYC subway signs, red checkered table cloths, and wooden decor, it feels like a pizza shop. + The pizza tastes fantastic.  MEH: - The pizza took about 30 minutes to get to us. Other authentic, personal pizzerias (Settebello's, Balboa), took about half that much time.  TLDR: The pizza is competitively priced for its quality and the staff makes the dining experience smooth. Sometimes it takes a while to get the pizza to you.",

I could literally pull the raw dough apart. The onions seemed raw, but the chicken was extremely overdone and dry, some sauce would probably have helped that out.

The days of my childhood when I looked forward to pizza because of the small \"Barbie Table\" inserted in the center of the pie. As life has grown dimmer, Grimaldi's has consistently become the shining light of my life.   Instead of a small plastic table, Grimaldi's inserts love, passion, and a small basil leaf at the center of every pizza.   Kevin and Eric are experts in their trade. Effortlessly and professionally rotating and cooking each pizza to a correct amount of wellness. The way Kevin checks the underside of each pie reminds me of my childhood, so much passion, so much curiosity and innocence. Furthermore, watching Kevin work is like witnessing Mozart complete his 5th Symphony-an absolute masterpiece. The passion and desire for perfection that goes into each pizza is incredible. It leaves my thirst and desire for this lovely resturatunt unsatiated. I would recommend this pizza to Jesus Christ himself as his Last Supper. For thy service is unrivalled. After consuming my delicious and delectable meal, a lovely man named Logan assisted me in parting the front doors.   Seeing Grimaldi's laying dormant, awaiting my festivities gives me hope in the world. Hope that people like Kevin and Eric will bring more enjoyment in the form of a pizza to the world. Without people like Kevin, the world would be a darker place. And for that, I will never be able to thank Grimaldi's for their undying efforts in pleasing my desires.  Dana was cool too. Good server. 10/10 Would recommend.",

Jason the Manager delivered my pizza to me, he was also very friendly, Lisa the General Manager was very Attentive, she looked up, saw that I needed a box. And instantly offered to bring it to me. Lastly Kendal the Bartender was very hospitable as well. Working the bar and also the floor must be hard for some. She made it look easy. They all worked as a TEAM which isn't utilized a lot lately. Hate I waited so long before trying this spot out, now that I'll be moving to another state soon. I wouldn't wanna leave without acknowledging everyone that works here. Even the proprietors that prepared my pizza. Awesome service. Thanks",

    "text": "Shaking my head.  Flabbergasted. I mean everyone is going to have this experience at some point. A bad experience.  One of those experiences that alters your habits. The \"I'll never _____ here again\" experiences . It's not the first time and I'm sure it won't be the last.  The thing that stings is Grimaldi's pizza is the best pizza in sin city. You might be thinking \"wtf is he talking about, if it's so good why is he blasting them with one star?\" It's not the pizzas fault. The pizza is not to blame. The pizza is innocent. The pizza is delicious.  This review isn't about the pizza. It's about the people behind the pizza.   Chronicled below is my heartbreaking tale of why I'm walking away from the best pie in town.   It's a breezy Friday night in Sin City and Grimaldi's is a popular joint. Has been ever since I came to this town. Pies can move slow when the dining room is full up. I get that.  No worries. People are fallible creatures. We all make mistakes. I get that too.  What I don't get is this; We order an app, 3 pies, drinks. Waitress informs us that it's running slow on pies, \"no worries place is full up\" I say.  \"It's not so much that\", she replies, \"it's all the Togo orders.\"   Huh?, ok. I'm facing the kitchen so I kinda keep an eye on what's going down, pizza guys are flying, Mach speed pizza production is in full effect. They are cranking out pizzas but they're all going into boxes. Maybe 1 in 10 pies are hitting the floor.  I assume the majority of them are being retrieved by Uber eats/door dash/grub hub outfits.  Huh. Kinda bs. I know they're probably killing it with the delivery game but you got a dinning room all waiting over an hour for pie.  Fast forward over an hour. Pizza arrives. 1 pizza is incorrect. Get servers attention, they go to fix the pie but by the time another pie comes out the entire party is long done with the other 2 pies. Now that person is hungry, frustrated, and doesn't want to hold up the entire party. We ask for Togo boxes, we've had our fill.  The pizza while still as good as it's ever been had a tinge of disappointment.  Even at this point I'm like well shit happens, sucks but what ya gonna do? Then the proverbial straw that broke the camels back.  Waitress returns with the bill. No apologies for the mix up but wants to know if we want dessert or coffee. I remind her we ordered coffee at the beginning and she didn't bring them then, will she now?  Puzzled looks ensue. I show her the bill with the charge for the coffee.  She goes to remove the coffee and just the coffee. I'm like you should remove the pie you jacked up too but we're all frustrated at this point and I don't wanna be Karen the \" I wanna speak to your manager\" meme.  Waitress informs us not come in here on Friday, Saturdays. Excuse me?  Interesting businesses model. What am I supposed to take away from that?  \"Fuck right off on Friday and Saturday because we are to busy making Togo orders and dealing with human customers is a pain in the ass.\"  Or was it the \"instead of any apologies for the mistakes, any compensation for your patronage, give us your $111 bucks and don't come back.\" I'm of the opinion that's it's both and don't fret Grimaldi's, it breaks my heart but I get the message, loud and clear.",

    "text": "Until  tonight I loved this location!  Not anymore! . Went there to use my Birthday offer- seated at an open table and waited and waited for someone to come to our table of two for approximately 10 minutes. I finally got up and went over to the three manager type people standing by the  serving area and informed them that we had not been waited on yet. The gentleman came over Took our  order but said oh she must be busy out in the patio area. Not True....she had been floating around but no acknowledgment at all during that 10 minute period. We then waited for an hour for our pizza. People that were seated after us were served and had eaten and been ready to leave when our pizza arrived. The pizza itself was great but the customer service relations was terrible. Will not be returning to that location. We were not the only ones having issues. The table next to us was delivered a pizza that was not there's and ate one piece of it and then the staff came over and said they delivered the wrong pizza. They had to wait for their pizza to come out but keep in mind whoever's pizza that was delivered incorrectly now was waiting for their pizza to be made. All we heard tonight was excuses. No bill adjustment.  Poor customer relations all around.",

It was a delightful experience and we will be back for sure. The small Mediterranean Salad was a delightful crisp and tasteful salad that was big enough for two with leftovers. We ordered 2 12 inch pizzas The Don and one with other things. We each ate half and are bringing that home along with a delightful looking piece of tiramisu! It was delicious and the staff was amazing! We heard the dinner crowd gets crazy so we went in early and the staff was on point and you could tell they were getting prepared for a busy night! Thank you for a delightful experience!",

As we looked around we can see clusters of servers chatting about personal situations for about 10 mins. The appetizer finally comes  and the server for my table ask is my husband if we are ok? My husband says he would like more Pepsi and and the server gives an annoyed look to my husband.  For good pizza, the service we have received was slow paced and without care. Not worth returning.",

    "text": "We normally Love Grimaldi's and this is our favorite location in the Las Vegas valley. Usually it's fast and friendly service and great pizza. Tonight neither was the case. It's a Saturday night but after 8p , we were seated right away. Coincidentally a very large party was just seated at the patio. It's my birthday weekend and we came for my free pizza. After we ordered and received our drinks we were told it would be 50 more minutes for our pizza due to the large party. Well we were already 15 minutes in so we stayed. However this should've been told to us before we were seated and definitely before we ordered. Our server Christina was over touchy feely. She touched my arm , back and shoulder at least three times and my husband about the same. Very inappropriate and made us uncomfortable. When we spoke to the manager he made no apologies and rather said seriously you would not wait 45-55 minutes. Wow. So then our pizza magically appears pretty much raw. And the server not once asked if everything was ok. We weren't offered a bread basket or appetizer while we waited .... in fact we were charged for my iced tea. They seriously could've comped a soft drink. No offer of a complimentary dessert, heck it's my birthday weekend after all. And when we paid the $3.25 bill the rudeness continued. The server brought us $1.75 in coins!!! Half of which went all over the floor, so that was what we left as her tip. If I was the manager I would never argue with a customer. I would make it right .... he could've said sorry , comped the one tea, sent over a free piece of cake or even send over a pizza to go to enjoy later. The all coin tip , inappropriate touching and lack of remorse for the situation by the manager was appalling.",

It seems to be a nice joint on the inside, looks like a hip area to enjoy some pizza with your pals. However I got my order to go, the gal at the bar was really helpful in handling the crowds when this place was packed. I took my pizza to go, and was able to sneak a slice whilst in traffic. Really liked the sauce and dough. Will probably stop by again for another gander.",

Not greasy in the least. Their salads are fresh and tasty and well sized.

The menu is pretty simple, they offer pizza and salad and a few basic appetizers, that's it. You really only have the option of ordering pizza here. Great for us, not the place to go if you are looking for anything else. They offer 3 sizes of pizza - personal (plenty for 2 adults), medium and large. The base prices are $14, $16, $18 and each topping that you add runs about $2 each. Three great things about this pizza - the crust, the sauce and the cheese. The cheese is excellent,fresh mozzarella is wonderful. I love coffee and the coffee is great here too.   They don't have a kids menu but Grimaldis is kid friendly. My kids love to go here specifically because they get to play with pizza dough while they are waiting for the food the come out. I have noticed that not all servers automatically bring this out but once we ask, they always do. The kids have a lot of fun with the dough!   Grimaldis is usually busy at peak times and there's usually a wait of 10-20 minutes.   Highly recommend Grimaldis.",

    "text": "Wow. That has to have been the BEST pizza I've ever had. We ordered two pizzas, one margarita and one with sun dried tomatoes, sausage, and meatballs. Both were spectacular. The crust was thin and crispy, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. The toppings tasted extremely fresh and the pizza was not oily. I'm one of those people who dab the pizza with a napkin if I see oil on it, but this time I didn't have to! They use a coal oven to cook their pizzas, which results in a very crispy crust. I heard they take Las Vegas water, purify it, and turn it in to the same composition as NY water for their pizza dough. I'm not sure if that's their secret or the oven, but it was delicious!   After eating tons of pizza we were stuffed but....we decided to order dessert! And boy, were we not disappointed. We split a cannoli and yum it was delicious. The exterior shell was crisp, as if it was just stuffed! The filling was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. The atmosphere was very pleasant, and the service was wonderful and attentive. The parking was also great. Since it's in a shopping mall area, there are a ton of spots. Plus, after eating about half a large pizza each (8 big slices in a large pizza) we were able to go shopping!",

They even have outdoor bar seating that overlooks the entire resturaunt. Very cool.  Positives: 1)Awesome Pizza 2)Amazing home-made cheesecake (2nd best I have found in town) 3) Great location and atmosphere 4)Wicked crust (chewy and cruchy and thin at the same time...awesome)  Bummers 1)It is kind of pricey. We got a large 3 topping pizza for $28 bucks. Its no pizzahut price, thats for sure! But you pay for what you get 2)Sometimes the hostesses can be a little standoff-ish but the bartenders and servers are always great!  Soooo, what's for dinner now yo...Pizza anyone??",

The pizza is made with a relatively thin crust, but it could be thinner. The brick oven definitely helps improve crust quality. Pizza was topped by a high-quality pepperoni. Service was friendly and efficient. Great dessert too, loved my chocolate cheesecake. :P Only disappointment: their crushed red pepper is not hot enough.",

    "text": "Ok, so I am a big food junkie.  Everywhere my friend Leo and I go we look up the best pizza places in the area.  I just moved to Las Vegas and asked where we should go to get some good pizza  He said he has heard of a place called Grimaldi's and that it has some very good reviews so we decided to go.  We go there around lunchtime and was greeted by a very pleasant staff. Since it was our first time there the manager of the place came out to greet us and recommended a few items on the menu.  We started off with a  Chicken Caesar  Salad which was amazing.  I don't like my Caesar to be too fishy, this one was perfect.  It was a nice fresh start to our meal.  Then we ordered a small calzone with meatballs and pepperoni which by the way is far from small.  It came with this marinara sauce that was so delightful that I wanted to take some home with me so I could dip everything in it.  It was cooked to perfection as was the pizza we ordered.  The pizza was a large with red sauce, pepperoni, sausage and basil.  Let me tell you, after eating there I can easily say Las Vegas' best pizza by a long shot.  The pizza was hand tossed with the freshest ingredients, topped perfectly and was also cooked to perfection.  I don't always judge a pizza by whats on it but by the way the dough is cooked as well.  I usually don't eat the crust but I couldn't help myself here, it was just so good.  So after all that food I had to try the desert.  I figured since everything else was so good the deserts must be the bomb, and they were.  I had the tiramisu and he had the canoli.  I didn't think I had anymore room left but when I tasted that tiramisu I couldn't stop until it was gone.    Between the awesome staff, the great food and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say it is the best pizza place I have ever been so far.  If another place wants to take the top spot in my book they are going to have to be something spectacular because this is an amazing place to eat.  I definitely will be bringing out of town guest, family and friends here whenever I get a chance.",

Grimaldi's is the pizza place that you will travel to although its completely out of the way because of the quality of the product.  My best friend and I split a Mushroom with Ham pizza with white sauce.  Every bite was a tribute to deliciousness.  To top off the perfect experience the server was not just attentive but offered great info on what we were eating.  We finished off the meal with what has become something that my stomach actually calls our for since our last visit, the Butterscotch Toffee Cheesecake.  This cake was one to savor. I double checked my fork to make sure I didn't miss anything when I pulled it from my mouth  So so good.  The server was kind enough to inform me that my drive would be cut short soon as they are opening a Grimaldi's ten minutes from where I reside.  The planned site is south Rainbow, right next to the Hooters place.  I can't wait. Pass the word as it should be open by March I hear.",

I was wrong on all accounts. The menu offered plenty of options. We settled on an 18 inch traditional pizza with meatballs, mushrooms, black olives and bell peppers.  It did not disappoint!!! The thin crust was delightful. The homemade sauce, divine.  Oh, and the meatballs are delicious! I wish that they offered spaghetti and meatballs but, remember, this is not an Italian place, it is a pizza place. Rather, it is THE pizza place. I cannot believe how amazing this pizza is!  We capped off dinner with a Dessert Trio and opted for three different types of cheesecake which I HAD to try after our host explained that they make it fresh daily and then touted that it could go toe to toe with any cheesecake in town. I LOVE me some good cheesecake and theirs is like a creamy piece of Heaven.   All of the staff that we encountered were great. Pleasant, knowledgeable, attentive and helpful! Can't wait to go back!",

I arrived early, so I sat at the bar and talked to the coolest bartender, Andrea.  She was the kind of person you just get drawn in and want to chit chat with all night.  She picked out a great glass of red wine for me too!  When we say at our table, our waitress came around all bubbly and full of personality. I think her name was Kimberly.   We got the Caprese Salad to start and then tried the Diavolo pizza as our meal. Both were very delicious!!!    The pizza was that good thin crust with lots of toppings and a great tasting crust.

The waiter was very patient in explaining all the different styles and options you have to choose from with the pizzas. We settled on a large with chicken and cheese on top (3 of us). The pizza had so much flavor! All 3 of us tore that pie apart in no time! It never stood a chance! ;)  Our drinks never reached the bottom before quickly being refilled. The prices were fair and definately well worth it for the product you recieved!  Only negative at all in the whole experience was that when we were finished, the server asked us twice if we wanted desert, which we politely declined. We than waited for our bill....and waited. It wasn't a \"Burger-Dog-ish\" time wait...but it was starting to become a bit frustrating until a sweet lady swooped in and sped things up a bit. By no means a deal breaker, as we will certainly be back in the near future, especially when out of town relatives are visiting!  I highly recommend Grimaldis!!",

    "text": "I really love this place. The smell drives you in as soon as you enter. I love the layout too of this grimaldis because it has a bar on one side that has open seating to outside. On a nice day, all that fresh air and nice breeze comes in the restaurant and gives it a nice touch.  The staff here is really hit or miss, sometimes you get a very nice, friendly, animated server, and other times you get a slow one that doesn't really care you are there. My food has always come out right though, so I wouldn't say this is a turn off from the food, which is always on point.  The pizzas have always been delicious no matter what I order.  My favorite here is the pesto pizza with red sauce, or a white pizza with fresh Italian sausage. Every pizza and dish is made to order and you can watch since the kitchen is in the back, but open.  I have also had the homemade desserts here, my favorite being the AMAZING cheesecake, some are seasonal but they always have original NY style. I have had their ceaser and house salads, both of which are good to share as a starter I think, before a pizza (so I feel less guilty!) The beer selection is alright, this is no brewery, but they have blue moon and some Italian beers or wine to match with your pizza.  Overall I really just love the food in this place. I have been to them all over the valley and this is probably my favorite if not just for the pizza, the ambiance.  It is a nice dinner place for a date or special outing! I will definitely be back here for some more.",

I sort of lacked confidence in the restaurant. The waitress never wrote down my order and ended up forgetting that we ordered garlic with our pizza.

    "text": "Having grown up in NYC my needs/expectations for pizza are simple: a thin, crunchy, but not cracker-like bottom crust; an edge crust that has some crack to it when you bite into it but not dry and high quality balanced toppings that share the stage with their counterparts.  Bring on the Grimaldis Margarita pizza!  They nailed it!  The slightly sweet Marinara sauce, thin sliced fresh mozzarella rounds and fresh basil leaves are the trio of flavors that define this pie.    For those hailing from the Big Apple folding a slice is the only way you can walk and eat in the subway or as you rush to your next destination. When folded the end should not sag and drop its toppings if you're consuming a \"plain pie\".  It's survival 101.  Try it on your slice at Grimaldis...it passed the test.  My recent trip to Vegas was the second time I've been to this establishment.  It was on my punch-list since my last trip 2 years earlier.  My BW another couple and I shared a large freshly prepared house salad (easily enough for 4-6 hungry eaters), some draft brews and the large Margarita pie made up our dinner out.  Service was efficient and fast (perhaps too fast since we were still passing the salad bowl around when the pie came).  The dining space was a little noisier than I like but, when the pizza arrived, no one needed to talk.  The pizza disappeared rapidly and I easily could have taken down another slice without much encouragement.  A TOTALLY enjoyable dinner for 4 under $50 is hard to come by in Vegas.   Oh yes, before we left Sin City a week later we went back for a 2nd time.  That's something to say in a town filled with wall to wall restaurants!",

So they do them well. Tip: don't let the word small on the salad menu fool you. A small salad can easily be split among 2 adults.  It's not a large place and it is very popular because it has great pizza, so there is almost always a wait at dinner time. The do have beer and a large wine selection, many available by the glass. Our service has always been amazing, even at the busiest dinner rush times.",

The pizza is super fresh, always made to order and you can taste the quality of ingredients. We recently went to redeem my wife's birthday offer (they offer a free 16\" pizza during your birthday month). Service and everything was great and their beer menu was surprising affordable. We usually come at least twice a year (birthday offers) and whenever we have a craving. Service has always been great.  My only critique is that the price point is a bit high for some of the items on the menu. You could easily be in the $40-50 range just ordering 2 pizzas. Add in drinks and maybe a salad and you could be north of $75 for a pizza dinner, a great pizza dinner but pizza non the less.  I would definitely recommend at least trying Grimaldi's, I don't think anyone would be disappointed.",

The outcome wasn't what I was hoping for. I really wish I could say I loved the pizza, or even liked it - but, that wasn't the case.   We ordered the Brooklyn Bridge & white with garlic and added artichokes, mushrooms and chicken. Those two pizzas were $68, seriously!?

I asked if they could put the ND game on because the GK was an exhibition game and not a season game.  I was put on hold for a lengthy time and then told they would have the ND game on when we got there.  We drove all the way over and then was told someone else wanted to see the Golden Knights game.  The manager couldn't show me one person who was watching the game.  All he could say was sorry but someone wanted to see the Knights - but couldn't tell me who. AND the GK game was on another TV facing outside so why did it have to be on all TV's. The only TV he was willing to put the ND game on couldn't be seen in the dining room.  So not only did I waste my time and gas driving over there, we missed most of the ND game because they lied and said the game would be on! As I was walking out a girl was so rude and said \"Well someone requested the Golden Knights\". I wasn't even talking to her, she was just rude and chimed in.  We eat there all the time and have had other issues with incorrect orders but this is the final straw!  Never again.",

    "text": "I had a friend who told me this is one of his favorite chains but the one he loves is in LA area. Since I was in Vegas, I figure I give this place a try even though he told me he's had it before and it wasn't as good as the LA location. Well, I won't know until I try it for myself. I came here with 2 other friends and we ordered a large spinach salad ($13 for a large size), 12 inch white pizza ($12) with chicken, sausage and basil for extra toppings and ended with a seasonal pumpkin cheesecake ($6).   The spinach salad I thought had too much dressing. I think if I were to get it again, I would ask for the dressing on the side. As for pizza, it was half burnt underneath. Just looking at the pizza you can tell it was overcooked because the basil that was on top was 95% toasty black. The first buy into the check half it was really dry. The sausage and mushroom was fine but I couldn't taste any garlic. It was a super poor experience.   When we got the bill it was about $60 after tax and tip--$20 per person. I was like how to fuck is it so expensive. All I had a little salad, TWO small slices of pizza and a few bites from the cheesecake. Definitely not worth the price for this quality of food. As of right now, I see no reason to waste my time revisiting this establishment. For this review I'm giving this a 1.5 star because the service was relatively good. I did feel like we were being rushed to leave even though it was an hour before closing.",

I noticed that this particular restaurant gets relatively busy between 6:00 P.M - 8:00 P.M, however, anytime before or after, was pretty easy to get seating.  I selected The \"Don\" pizza which had Italian Sausage, Meatballs, and Pepperoni. There was ricotta cheese on the pizza as well with the base a typical marinara sauce. The pizza was really good. It came out warm from the brick oven and the flavor profile was perfect. I would order the \"Don\" pizza again. It also warmed up well in the microwave, which is rare for pizzas.  For desert, I had the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake. This was a monster slice, similar to the cheesecake factory slices. Make sure to have a semi-empty stomach if you're ordering desert from Grimaldi's. The cheesecake was amazing! It wasn't too sweet, and the cheesecake texture wasn't too soft either.  I'd go back to Grimaldi's again!",

It was delivered by Door Dash, but I don't believe Door Dash is responsible. The pizza was cold, and it was burnt. I've honestly never seen a nastier pizza. If I can figure out how to upload the photo I took, I will. As another reviewer commented, \"Just looking at the pizza you can tell it was overcooked because the basil that was on top was 95% toasty black.\" Yep, mine, too. I sent a review to Door Dash, and they immediately refunded half the cost of the pizza. As I already said, tho, I don't believe any of this nastiness was Door Dash's fault. Sorry, Grimaldi's, but Rosati's has you beat on every level. Now, if I can get that image of the black basil leaves out of my head....",

    "text": "I'm not a super big pizza fan, but I like me a good pizza from time to time. So when given the opportunity to eat a free one topping 16\" pizza - It's ON like Donkey KONG!  My girlfriend had a coupon for a free pizza since it was her birthday and all she had to do was to sign up on the interwebs. She had Grimaldi's before and swore like a sailor about how great their pizzas were.  The place is on the end of a strip mall-esque location, but easy to find. Look for the Cafe Rio and the giant Grimaldi's sign. The interior ambiance had a very New York Italian pizzeria feel to it. Checkered table cloth, pictures of New York on the wall, and the smell of pizza.  The menu is not super extensive, but has what you'd expect from a pizza joint - pizza, topping selection, calzones, salads, and a good selection of wines and beers.  We were seated pretty promptly and our orders taken. I noticed that both our forks had some specs of dried food residue (cheese?). It's no biggie as I used some water and the cloth napkin to give the silverware a good wipe down. Kinda of gross, but not the end of the world. It will just make our immune systems stronger says I!  We ordered the meatball and pepperoni 16\" pie with a Grimaldi's House Salad. The salad was pretty tasty and the dressing was good.  When the pizza came out it looked fantastic and tasted great! The meatballs were flavorful and married with the pepperoni took it to the next level. The crust was NY style and thin. Not thin crust like balsa wood, but not thick like some of the chain pizza places. The cheese level and topping quantity was generous, but stopped about an inch from the edge of the crust which is reasonable.  If you're wondering, a 16\" pie was about right for both of us. We have normal sized appetites and ended up taking one slice home.  Overall I thought the pizza was good, but Grimaldi's overall was fine. I'm not really a fan, but I'm not going to turn down free pizza either.",

You can build your own pizza and the topping prices can definitely add up but its worth it to be able to customize it how you want. We ordered a medium for two people and had one slice leftover lol. The salads are also delicious and the small is a good size to share between two people.   The last time I came here we sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly and entertaining.

This is not your normal pizza place it's a little more upscale. So don't be afraid to bring anyone here to impress them. Everyone we ever brought here has returned.  Great pizza. Great salad. Homemade deserts and full bar. Home style feel. This is our favorite place to go in vegas!",

Well I know some hole-in-the-wall places don't but this is big chain & you gotta give the people what they want, RANCH!   The service was just ok.   On a positive note- they had a decent wine list.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like the pizza here. I've had Grimaldi's several times searching for why it gets such great ratings on national reviews. Again I left in disappointment.   I will start with saying that the crust is perfect which is the reason for the bump up to three stars.   The rest of the pizza fails. They use fresh mozzarella which when straight out of the oven is fabulous but when you're ready for slice two it's rubbery. The sauce is also lacking in much flavor.   I've tried the margarita and pesto pizza in the past. This time I got veggie pizza with added chicken and extra cheese.  Again the crust is perfect. The toppings were basically raw and almost cold when it came straight from the oven.   I wasnt impressed at all.   The whole time I was there I was watching the manager and other employees enjoying in n out burger in the side room wishing I had made the same decision.   Caprese salad looks pretty but the tomatoes are not truly ripe.  For a dish like this you really need better quality vine ripe tomatoes.   Service was good.   They don't keep the Parmesan , garlic and oregano on the table. I did notice some of the employees palm them from the top when they brought them out.  Not sanitary.",

Wasn't disappointed. Pizza on a brick oven? What else is better? Waitress was great. She brought our food and drink out fast and even brought me a whole fresh pie when my cup was accidentally dropped into my Pizza. Amazing all around experience. If anyone asked I would definitely recommend them because the food is great but because the staff was even better. Thank you guys",

Regarding the food, it was just ok. I did enjoy the salad and the first piece of pizza but afterwards the pizza got cold in just a few minutes. They need to serve it on a hot plate to keep it warm. Service was attentive and the food was served very quickly. Friendly server.",

Water is shipped in from NYC to give the thin crust that New York flavor. The server was great. Ask for Bryna. The restaurant is very clean.  We just ordered the pizza and salad.  Both were delicious.  I don't like cheesecake but my wife got some.  She said it was so good she wanted to visit Vegas again just to get this cheesecake.   I would definitely come here again. It you're visiting Vegas it's nice because it's not right on the strip.  You get to experience a little bit of what the city is really like",

Another time a server remembered our exact order even though he only served us one time before a month prior! Amazing! One time though, we got a different server, and I am not kidding when I say she was on drugs, so I guess you could say service is hit or miss. I have also tried every salad and they're also very good.  Sangria is amazing there as well. They also said i could bring my fur baby on the patio, haven't done it yet, but thats a big plus in my eyes!",

It was soooo good.  The sauce had a great flavor and just the right amount of cheese and pepperoni.  It can be pricey once you start adding toppings and extras but its a great time and worth it.

Our salads were delivered 5 minutes before our water and the two bottles of wine we ordered. I could have lived with that if, I had actually been able to eat it, But we had no silverware.  When our wine finally did appear it was the wrong two bottles. Our server asked us if we were sure that we knew what we ordered.  Eventually the correct wine appeared.   The salads were fresh and tasty.   The pizza was also very good.  Our server never came back to check on us, but another employee did,   It took a while to get our check.   I wish I could give Grimaldi's three stars because the food was good, they have a nice patio, and an outside bar. The service was not good, but I chalk it up to poor training.  I never saw a manager or anyone who appeared to be in charge, so I am reluctant to place the blame squarely on the wait staff. Attitude goes along way, and even though they appeared to be struggling, they were always smiling.  If I am ever back that way, I'll give it another shot, because the pizza was that good..",

Fortunately, Vegas is only a short trip away, and Grimaldi's is the place to get your fix!   On our last trip to Vegas, I split a pie with my brother for lunch, sausage and mushroom. Toppings were good, but what I really dug was the cheese, slices of fresh mozzarella laid on top of the pie, comparable to Lombardi's in Manhattan. Sauce was good, and lastly, the crust had the authentic, coal fired char that makes the pie really stand out.   My favorite pizza in Sin City and I can honestly say that I've sampled nothing in California that quite matches up to Patsy's.",

GRIMALDI'S ROCKS, which is on the opposite end of all of those worthless places on TV.  The crust is crispy, and crooked, and uneven, and just absolutely delicious alone.  The sauce is not too sour/sweet, just tastes of fresh tomatoes and herbs.  The combination of cheese and fresh sauce, with that crispy smoky crust just makes this place the best pizza period.  I had it at the OG Brooklyn bridge location and also drove 30 minutes from the Strip in Vegas.  BOTH places are equally good, and yes, Vegas, Brooklyn, or any other city where they open a franchise, I will be there.  I LOVE GRIMALDI's!!!!",

We also got the antipasto platter to start, which was a nice plate of meats and cheeses. The olives were *really* tart though, I usually love 'em but even I couldn't take the pucker.  Also did not get any bubbled up cheese/crust on our pie. Doesn't take anything away, but there's nothing like a huge bubble of cheese on your slice.",

Me being me, i was scared to vier away and try something new and give up what is always sure to be a wonderful pizza experience!   So how did i try Grimaldi's?? Well, i was in a wedding on Friday and was busy all day from 9am-till after the reception ending at about 11:00pm, leaving the husband to fend for himself for the day!  I get a call about 4:00pm, \"honey, I have a surprise for you! Can i tell you what it is? Can i please???\" My reply \"No love, that would make it not be a surprise anymore, now i have something to look forward to...  I will get it when i see you!\" and due to the fact that i at this point have large hair, too much make-up on and am in a freezing cold reception room trying to get all the name cards placed on the tables and get the bride ready and keep her happy, while keeping the kids outta the way and clean in their flower girl dresses i am excited to have a surprise waiting for me when all is said and done!!!  Driving home after a beautiful wedding, the husband says... \"are you excited for your surprise? Can i give you a hint??\"  \"Yes dear, i am VERY excited for my surprise, lay it on me!\"   \"Remember what we wanted to try, but didnt want to give something else up for?\"  I came home to half a pizza from Grimaldi's!!!!!!! :)  AAAaaahhhh, how cute!!  Ok, back to the review.. while it was cold and not pipping hot and fresh i few minutes of heating up, it was wonderful!!! Now, I cant wait to go get one and try it fresh, its WAY closer to the house than Settebello's is and now I am willing to give it a try and vier away at least once!  So for now 4 stars, and if this location is closer or better for you than Settebello's is (at least for now till they move next to Whole Food's in The District) it is a fair trade off, or even if you want to go crazy and mix it up a bit!!!  Now can i get a.... WWHHOOOAAAA PIZZA!!!!!!! :)",

I ordered my pizza by phone to be picked up. 1. I'm told they don't have green peppers only sweet red. Fine I can handle that.  2. I'm told 20 minutes it will be ready.  I arrive in 15. The pizza is ready. But it takes 10 minutes for the bartender, who is also the carry-out cashier to wait on me. 3. The pizza is no longer piping hot.  4. The pizza was supposed to be Italian sausage & \"Red peppers\"! I'm posting a photo of the pizza. See if you can find the sausage. I think there is more sausage on McDonald's sausage biscuit sandwich. I can here Clara Peller yelling \"where's the beef\" from her grave. 5. The only reason that I'm able to give this place a star, is because the pizza was in fact very tasty. The sausage was very good when you could find a bite. Good sauce and fresh peppers.   I will probably try them again and order double sausage. Maybe I can put it all on one half and say I'm eating a SAUSAGE pizza!!!",

    "text": "We went there for a late lunch today.  There were a lot of wait staff, but only two 20 something customers.  The menu is pretty much pizza and salads.  My husband was the one craving pizza, so I let him order a sausage, mushroom, and onion regular 16\" pie.  The pizza is New York style; thin, chewy crust.  There was a nicely spicy sausage, a real stringy cheese and fresh mushrooms and onions.  Then why didn't I like it?  It's the crust, Mr. Pizza Man!  Yes, they were spinning and twirling it.  Yes, it had pockets of char.  But overall it had NO flavor.  The pizza at Settebello is so much better there is no contest.    The service started strong with quick drinks and refills, but ended on a bad note.  We not only got the wrong bill (nope, we did not have salad and Tirimisu.  The only other customers in the house did.), but to add insult to injury we practically had to stand on our chairs and shout to get it fixed because all the staff was flirting with the 20 somethings.  Would we come back?  Nope.",

The crust is fantastic -- it's not that cheap crunchy garbage you get at the wanna-be NY pizzerias, this stuff is legit. It's thin, but somehow manages to maintain a soft, chewy texture that perfectly compliments their fresh ingredients and phenomenal cheeses.   They say the secret to the crust is in the water... which is why they hired a chemist to recreate NYC tap water for the Las Vegas stores. It sounds nuts... but it worked, so I'm not complaining.   The ambiance is great, very urban and trendy (according to my wife, I don't pay attention... I'm there for the food). It's nice enough to not feel tacky taking a date there, but casual enough that you can wander in whenever and pull up a chair at the bar to watch the game. We enjoyed watching the chefs toss the dough and laugh when the new guy struggled with it.   I've been to both the Eastern and Boca Locations and both are similarly excellent. I'll be back again soon.",

    "text": "A salad had to do some heavy lifting to earn that fourth star because the pizza at Grimaldi's does not knocka my socksa off. However, the za is not greasy or heavy, and I think the sauce is solid. When it all comes together, it's a nice pie. Plus, the restaurant is nice, and they do have a fabulous patio.   My minor complaints: The crust is a bit too crispy. The cheese is not provocative. The cost is pretty pricey, which usually leads to me deciding to go with a one topping pie - never mind blowing. Plus, I find it odd that they don't have specialty pies where you can realize some savings by getting a crazy combo they've dreamed up. Is that amateur of me?  The star for me, however, is the salad. Even a house salad manages to impress with super fresh ingredients and large serving portion. I guess what I am saying is go for the za stay for the green.",

The pizza also included fresh mozzarella, and basil. It was so good, that we finished all but one slice on premise -- we wouldn't  typically consume an entire large pizza in one seating.  The employees were friendly and the service was attentive.  Why not 5 stars? I've had tastier crusts in my lifetime, but when you consider that this is a large, well ran chain, and not your local artisan pizza nazi with a nightly line of groupies -- they are deserving of a solid 4.5 stars.",

The crust is very NYC and adding the special touch of baking it in a coal burning oven really adds to the flavor.  I like my pizza topping simple pepperoni and sausage and they use very special pepperoni not the cheap kind and the mozzarella they use is very creamy not stringy.

Although, Grimaldi's isn't exactly in Vegas but it is worth the drive when visiting.  The biggest advantage to visiting the Vegas location versus Brooklyn is space.  This restaurant is much larger and therefore, no wait time.  The downside is slow service once seated.  You also do not have that 'authentic' down-home feel like the Grimaldi's in BK.  The ambiance is like any other pizza joint, nothing special and nothing unique.  There's nothing like the original but the white pie here was still pretty damn good.  Don't forget to add sun-dried tomatoes.  And if you have room left, try the cannoli.   Some people like fast food for the 'cheap' deals so if you prefer to stick to the dollar menus or have Domino's just to save a few bucks then keep it moving.  Grimaldi's isn't your cheap or even average-priced pizza.  It is worth the extra $ so treat yourself sometime!  4 STARS for this location 5 STARS for the original location - must try but beware of the long line!",

    "text": "I love thin-crust pizza, I love fine cheese, and I love Grimaldi's.  Vegas is not known for having great pizza, especially off the strip, which is why it's to the fortune of Vegas diners that we have an authentic pizza import from Brooklyn.  I'm a fan of crispy crust with a coal brick-oven toasty taste, thus Grimaldi's crust is probably one of my favorite.  The house sauce is flavorful, not overwhelming.  For a treat, I always order the pesto sauce, which tastes of fresh basil every time.  Their meaty toppings (sausage, pepperoni, etc.) are very good so if you are a traditional pizza eater, I suggest the sausage with roasted sweet peppers.  The only drawback is: toppings are $2-$4 each so the price can stack up quickly for a regular-ingredients pie.  However, if you're in the mood for a different palette, order the pesto sauce with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken.  I find that this combination puts together an absolutely delicious gourmet pizza seldom found elsewhere.  Fresh basil pesto, slightly sweet & lavish ricotta, top-quality sun-dried tomatoes, and tender grilled chicken always win me over at first bite.",

    "text": "Did I like this place? yes and no. I came here with my husband, three children, two sisters, a niece, a nephew, and two brothers-in-law. I thought the food was pretty good, except for the fact that there was clearly a cheese shortage. Ordering extra cheese wasn't enough. I suppose you would have to order extra, extra, extra cheese if you wanted to actually taste the cheese on your pizza. Oh well, the flavor was good. The white pizza with garlic and mushrooms was excellent. Wow, I would definitely order that again.   Here's the problem with the place - it was REALLY uncomfortable. First of all, when we arrived they made us stand at the front with a bunch of young children until every single person in our party arrived. That policy is extremely irritating for people with young children or elderly in the group. There really wasn't a good place to sit and wait, but we did our best crammed in by the front door. Once everyone arrived, they brought us to our table. That's when things got worse.   The table was REALLY bad. We were so crammed in that we could barely move. I dreaded each time that a child had to go to the bathroom, or that I had to stand up to do something. I must have banged into the people behind me ten times. I know that table hated me, but come on, I wear a size 4 -- I should be able to stand up to do something briefly and sit down without shoving my behind in anyone's face. That's not asking for too much room. To my dismay, most of the time I banged the chairs at adjacent tables, and found myself apologizing over and over throughout dinner. I was tempted to stand up and just move our entire table, but thought that would make a scene, so I didn't.   The food was pretty good. The atmosphere was terrible. I might come here again with just one friend, but I would be careful when agreeing to sit at a particular dining table. Decent food, but an uncomfortable dining experience.",

Getting to why this location gets 5 stars...   We sat at the bar to catch the playoff game, and had one of the best customer service experiences ever.    Tracy, the bartender, was rad!  She subtly began talking with us after she got us some beers and took our order.  Through casual conversation Tracy was able to identify what things we had in common and have genuine and engaging interaction with us.    After an hour or so of beers, pizza, and great service we had to go, but I would make the trip from Summerlin again for the same experience.  Thanks Tracy!",

    "text": "Grimaldi's for me is the best place in Las Vegas for traditional coal oven pizza. It's not 100% Neapolitan, it is more like coal oven NY style.  The crust is crispy on the outside, soft, moist and chewy in the middle (foldable) and has a nice aroma from the coal oven. The sauce tastes fresh and balanced (bordering slightly on sweet).  If you expect to find the gobs of generic \"cheese\" found in most pizza places you won't find it at Grimaldi's. They use fresh mozzarella and it barely covers the pizza crust but it is fresh and delicious and you can taste it in every bite. And if that's not enough, the pizza is not greasy at all!  It is satiating without bloating you up and making you feel like you ate an anvil.  As for toppings I usually order their red peppers and maybe some extra cheese or sauce. I have tried adding chicken but the pizza ended up very moist.   Their Mediterranean salad is fresh and a decent serving.  The cheesecake is pretty good, not artificially and overly sweet like some others, sweet enough to taste like dessert while also tasting fresh.  Service has been very good and the staff has been very attentive. There is some outdoor seating which is great, especially when it's windy. Inside the decor makes you feel like you're in NY with pictures, street signs, rail signs etc.  Overall one of the best pizza places in the valley and the best for oven baked pizza. I prefer Grimaldi's over Settebello for thin oven baked pizza; though quite similar in many respects, Grimaldi's gets my vote.",

This Grimaldi's has a really cool patio with half the bar on the inside and half the bar on the outside. We opted to sit on the outside portion and we were greeted by Anthony...one of the sassiest (can you say that about a dude?), coolest, funniest bartenders I have ever met. He totally made fun of me for trying to order ranch for my pizza (yeah, yeah i'm one of those weirdos). My bf got a good laugh out of that and I admitted defeat....I would just have to enjoy the pizza on its own.   Good thing I did because it was delicious. The large pie with extra cheese, pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms was delightful. Be prepared not to have any leftovers because its so good. I could only finish 2 pieces...down from my usual 4. Trust me when I say this is as close as its going to get for NY pizza in Vegas (my man would agree and he's a TOTAL pizza snob).

I like a coal fired pizza, I like the crisp. blackened crust and this crust was great...I may ask for it to be left in the oven a little longer for a crust that has a few more black spots. But the crust was chewy and overall this was a great dining experience. The wait staff was terrific and I have not one single complaint! YAY! Oh wait...I'm Italian, Sicilian actually and was raised by my Sicilian grandma who served every meal with BREAD! Where is the bread? Every table should be served with bread! I know it's high is carbs but it's also high in taste!  My previous, less fabulous review was for the location in Henderson, this one is for the newly opened south west location. BTW, they still can't touch Metro!  One more thing, this pizza is best when eaten at the restaurant. I ordered take out once and I do not reccomend it. You lose the crispiness of the crust and it turns a bit soggy. Also, its not good reheated. It is at it's all time best straight from the coal oven.",

    "text": "Being from California I learned that Grimaldi's will never step into my state. Not because we are in the worse financial situation in recent history but because air quality laws prevent the use of coal burning brick ovens. That being said, I could not pass up an opportunity to taste the famous pizza from the Brooklyn Bridge. It was an impressive pie and everything you want from a New York style pizza -  slightly burnt crust, great cheese, fresh basil. So it was good and my 4 star rating reflects my expectations for a pizza epiphany. Perhaps the Grimaldis in New York is a 5 star pizza, different than this Nevada franchise. Until I go back there for the real deal Holyfield, I will have to put this pizza with any other New York style pizza I've ever had.  Oh, I hope to be back soon. It was definitely good.",

    "text": "I opened up the restaurant with the opening crew three years ago.  I started as a bartender there.  So Grimaldi's, to me, is more than just another pizza joint.    Grimaldi's is what True Italian cuisine is all about.  Stated simply, ingredients.  Use ingredients that are the best and in season in your region and you will have wonderful results.  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of the desert where nothing fun to eat grows.  Luckily, everyone ships to Vegas.    When something is so simple as dough, cheese and sauce, the ingredients have to be the best.  Grimaldi's has a supplier from Italy that imports their tomatoes for them; they even use bottled water to make their dough.  I would think that pizza made from Vegas water would have to be subpar.  We have the worst water I've tasted in the states.  Their toppings, ranging from the pepperoni to the Ricotta cheeses, are all superior to any I've tasted in town.     The artist who sculpts the pie also makes a huge difference.  The dough is hand tossed.  I loved watching the head pizza maker, at the time, dance the dough on his finger tips.  His pies were, by far, superior to pies made from some of the other pie makers.  The artist turns the pie while it's in the oven, moving it closer or further from the coals.  This helps to ensure a tasty crust.  There have been a few times when I've eaten there and the pie was delicious with a flaky crusty crust.  There have been other times when the pie was undercooked for my liking and not as crispy.  But, overall, an excellent pie with gourmet ingredients.  So Grimaldi's, to me, is a place of nostalgia and of mixed feelings of a different time in my life.  The little pizzeria, to me, is quintessential East Coast and Italy.  The former is where I grew up; the latter I dream of going.  I still love Grimaldi's to this day.",

The vibe outside on the patio is sublime--sitting in the western sun, eating authentic NYC pizza, drinking a Peroni pitcher and watching my beloved Redskins on a flat screen. Heaven on earth!

I was sitting at the bar drinking a beer waiting for my to go order; Ray the bartender did a wonderful job taking care of me. The \"man in charge\" of all Nevada restaurants asked me how I was doing while I was waiting for my pizza. I explained that this was my first time and he insisted that I have my first slice right from the oven and offered to make me an additional pizza (free of charge) while I finished my beer. He then offered me a slice of blueberry cheesecake. I walked out of that place feeling on top of the world! The pizza was delicious; the cheese has such an amazing flavor and the cheesecake; unspeakable! It is very rare that people go above and beyond to make their customers happy! Thank you! I WILL be back :)",

    "text": "Okay, let's just get this out of the way right now - Grimaldi's is not New York style pizza. I know, Brooklyn Bridge, brick oven, yadda yadda.  But the style of pizza that they cook here is much closer in spirit to the artisan/VPN style pies than to the floppy, foldable slices that to me characterize New York pizza.  Until I discovered Settebello (and honestly, not until my second Settebello visit), I thought this was the best pizza that the Las Vegas valley had to offer.  Why? Ingredient quality.  One reason that Grimaldi's maintains as much share of my pizza eating as it does, in the face of Settebello's competition, is the fact that Settebello does not serve pepperoni, while the pepperoni you will find on a Grimaldi's pizza may well be the best damn pepperoni on earth. It's organic, and while I've never really a drinker of the organic Kool-Aid, when you taste this pepperoni, you'll wonder what the hell you've been eating all your life.  The sauce is basic, clean of flavor and just the right consistency. The crust is the best part of a Grimaldi's pizza, with that charcoal essence bringing out the flavor of the other ingredients, including fresh buffalo mozzarella that practically melts in your mouth.  Oh, and one last thing. The garlic powder that they offer as a seasoning isn't the granulated garlic that you typically find on grocery store shelves, it is a much finer grind, almost a real powder that actually seems to soak up the grease on top of a slice. I would love to know where I can get a bottle of this super-fine grind garlic. Anybody?",

The white pizza is beyond amazing with chicken on it. The dining area is super loud at times and can get warm with all the people and oven going. They do offer outdoor dining that is shaded in the afternoons.They also have curbside pick up. Kids get pizza dough and a small pie plate to play with while waiting. The salads are always fresh and their dressings are great! The staff is always very nice and attentive. Decent wine list and refreshing passion iced tea. Their cheesecakes wont disappoint either :) Be aware that they restoke the oven coals around 4-430 everyday and don't take orders at that time.",

So I've had NY pizza before...huge honking slices where folding is not just what the cool kids do, it's necessary to not give yourself a Chelsea grin while eating.  These slices are a bit more manageable in size...and much better tasting, in my opinion.  I looked forward to the white pizza we got, but I discovered they really load the ricotta on if that's what you order...and too much ricotta just doesn't sit well with me.  It tasted good, but it felt like my mouth was being stuffed with foam.  The mushroom, pepperoni, and sun-dried tomato pizza...now this was par excellence.  Even ignoring that sun-dried tomatoes may be my #1 condiment of all time (even beating out giardiniera), the crust was good, and the light sauce let the toppings shine.  Besides the food, we barely waited despite having a big party, and the service was good enough.  Definitely a fun place to go with a large group.",

Just great flavor, great atmosphere, great service.  A little pricey, but I would pay for it once a week when craving pizza, so it must not be too much of a deterrent.",

My favorites:  Caprese salad: perfect and simple. This restaurant does not try to reinvent the wheel on this dish.  Pizza: The standard thin crust that is perfectly baked in their coal ovens... get a piece with a pizza bubble on it!! I love the just-charred bits on here..  I usually get pesto with chicken.

I can't rate any other kind of pizza cause all I've had is the chicken pesto..  oh! caesar salad is also very delish.. 1 order is good for like 3 ppl.   also! it gets packed so be prepared if there's a wait.  not sure if they take reservations.. but if they do.. make one!",

    "text": "Ok why do I need to go to Las Vegas ( actually Henderson) to get a good New York Pizza? Because there is NO Grimaldi's in Los Angeles! While Deep dish is my FAVORITE style, I do love me a good NYC pie and this is tops. The crust is just perfect, well done, not soggy, with a bit of char on the edges ( the way a good NY should be thanks to a coal oven) the sauce is very tasty, although I would have liked a tad more. You can get extra sauce for $2 which is kind of annoying, just put more sauce on please. My favorite little pepperonis that get all crispy at the edges.  We also ordered the antipasto salad and a house salad, that had an awesome mix of veg, and literally could have fed 8 ( there were 4 of us).  Alas, I have to go back to LA and not -so- great selection of New York style pies. 1 Star off for making me pay for xtra sauce otherwise outstanding!",

It's a bit far off the strip (closer to South Point), but I think it's worth the drive.  This NY style pizzeria is delish.  The crust was thin and crispy, just the way I like it!  And they offer a red AND a white (garlic) sauce; I think both are definitely worth a taste.  Their salads were OK, but a good combination with the pizza.  Great service, great prices, great food.  I'll be back!",

Grimaldi's in NYC is better than Vegas.  Pizza in NYC generally speaking tastes different than anywhere else.  Most pizzeria owners that I know back home, say its the water that makes it taste different, and I actually have to agree.    Grimaldi's here make a great effort in providing NYC Style pizza.  The gf and I had a large pie with sweet red peppers, sausage and onions.  It's thin and crispy.  Saucey and cheesey however, it is not!  Seemed like they skimped on the sauce (which is their signature) and the cheese.  Especially, when the sauce and cheese are the main components of the pizza.  It was good, but not great.  Sadly, I left here unimpressed and missing NY a little more.  Atmosphere was good, they have an outdoor patio and full bar with a few flatscreens to watch the games.  Heard Giovanni's is better.  Will try Giovanni's next time I have a pizza craving.    **Make that Settebello's in Henderson**",

Grimaldi's is a bull's-eye they got it right. Thanks to the yelp reviewer who had recommended extra sauce. That really made the difference. The pizza is chewy in the right spots, crispy in the others. The ingredients are fresh. The sauce is seasoned to perfection and the cheese is supah-fresh!  I ordered take out and I will be back it's got a cool ambiance. Oh, and DO NOT SLEEP ON THE CANNOLLI!",

Our waiter recommended drizzling some oil and vinegar on it to enhance the flavors. It really did. The pizza tasted exactly like bruschetta and it was scrumptious.",

I highly recommend visiting and you can drop in, though groups should make a reservation. There is also a full bar for drinks or to hang out at while you wait for carry out. Of course the highlight is the pizza, True to the Brooklyn / Manhattan style and made in coal brick oven.",

    "text": "Hello Yelpers :)   Today's visit was to Grimaldi's Pizzeria. I was craving pizza and decided to call in to go.  I called Grimaldi's and Junnie(I think that's her name) answered the phone. Very polite woman.  Here is what I ordered: Small size pizza Half pesto and Half white  I added some toppings to both sides. Junnie repeated the order back to me and told me that she will give me a call back to tell me the total.  20 minutes later.... Still no call back. So I politely called back and asked if maybe they forgot and I didn't mind(maybe they were busy)?  Junnie answered the phone and apologized that she forgot to call back. Then I asked her if I should be on my way to pick up the pizza and she said it should be ready already sincere she already placed the order 15 minutes ago -___-  I got there and a worker opened the door For me(thank you)  I waited by the to go order area and this lady said; \"What's the name for the order?\" Me: \"Karen\" Her: okay your total is $38.92 Me: sounds good, by any chance do you have any ranch?  Her: we don't have that here  Me: oh.... Okay Her: have a great day.  What annoys me the most is that she just Left me with no options. WHERE IS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!?  Now on to the actual pizza. PIEOLOGY sh*ts on this place.  Check out the video and pictures attached to this review.  Took a bite out of the white pizza and the crust is so hard and you can taste the char. The bottom of the pizza is burned and not moist, very dry.  I am so sad because I love food and this place received great reviews and I did not enjoy this place at all. I'm sorry I'm not coming back...  I forgot to add.. After I ate Grimaldi's I now have food poisoning. Thank you.",

I like the choice on toppings, although it can get pricey at a couple bucks each.  The size of the food is enormous!  I had an individual pizza and could only eat 2 pieces.  I also had a small caesar salad and it was most certainly enough for 2 to 3 people.  The waitstaff was on top of things, the bartender very kind and the hostess a little sweetheart.    Only 2 complaints . . . first off, NO drink specials at all.  Happy hour doesn't exist here but I guess it doesn't have to.  Secondly, if you like to dip your pie in ranch, this is not the place.  Wonderfully authentic food, but not so good for those like myself who like to soak crust in delicious creamy goodness.  You know, a truly good ranch is one of the reasons I love specific pizza places . . . sorry if that's \"white trash\" to those foodies out there.  All in all though, I liked this place and I'll definitely return when I want upscale pizza!  :-)",

The food is pretty good though plus hairs give food fiber.  I'm just kidding, but our group had three different types of large pizzas.  They were all nice, thin, and prepared very well in their brick oven.  The desserts were also really good.  The cannoli's and tiramisu prepared very well.  The prices are a bit on the steeper side for pizza.   Each topping was a minimum of $2 more.   So yeah, some cost even more than $2.  Nonetheless, the food was still good.  It's a nice place to go once in a while.",

Pizza sauce wth fresh basil leaves, cheese and pepperoni are excellent and fresh. Our waitress gave us excellent service by frequent checking and filling our coffee.

We each ordered a salad which were fresh and good but the real main attraction was the pizza. You could watch and smell them being made which is great. We ended up with a pepperoni and mushroom. It came out excellent. A little car from the charcoal oven and a wonderful smokey flavor. It was really a great pie to eat warm. Near the end of the meal I was surprised by a manager (or possibly the owner?) coming over and asking how our meal was and really conversing with us. I said how great it was and how my girl raved about it to bring me here the first time - he said thats great and offered a free slice of cheesecake to each of us on the house! A really great guy and a really great atmosphere made for a really great meal. Only slight on it was there was some pizza left over and I took it home and frankly their pizza is nowhere near as good the next day. Straight from the oven crisp and warm is the way coal brick oven pizza needs to be and so be prepared to eat it all while there!",

It really helped us enjoy our night out and relax... and that is what pizza is all about, right?  It's a bit costly for pizza but it's that gourmet pizza trend. In this case, I think you do get what you pay for, so it's on our list when we want to go out and have pizza.  I probably wouldn't take my kids here, though. It's not a restaurant that caters towards kids, the pizzas take a while to cook (as expected) and there isn't a lot of entertainment or ambience that is kid friendly. I'd rather save this for adults, I know having obnoxious kids around would certainly ruin the relaxing atmosphere for me.",

Pizza ingredients are robust and high quality, and they don't go chintzy with the amount of toppings.",

I like the atmosphere of there restaurant and that you can see two pizza guys tossing the pizza dough - that was amusing to watch.  next time, i'll ask for extra basil!",

In the end, the pizza here is AWESOME. Our favorite is the Meatball Pizza. It sounds odd, but there really isn't large balls of meat on this pizza. The meatballs are sliced nice and thick and completely cover this thing adding a basil leaf or 2 to round it out. If you want to get crazy, add a little garlic powder to this mix and you have an amazing pizza that will keep you coming back. I always insist that we order a large even though there are only 2 of us. Why? Because the cold pizza in the morning is OUTSTANDING!!!  This place uses fresh ingredients, their kitchen is in full view of the entire restaurant, and the food is great. Don't pass this place by!",

However, we had a guy tonight who kept forgetting about our drinks and what we asked for. It was pretty busy there so it's not a big deal. Service is usually always great there.

    "text": "I've been spoiled by the Brooklyn location. About a year ago, we made the walk across the Bridge from Manhattan over to Brooklyn and found ourselves waiting in line at Grimaldi's. When we finally started eating, the pizza was properly seasoned, and the crust actually had that charred and burnt flavor that made the place so famous.  When I heard that there were Grimaldi \"chains\" all over the place, I was immediately intrigued. The closest one was in Las Vegas. So on the next trip, we decided to check it out for lunch. It was about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, closer to Henderson. We found ourselves at some strip mall, which reminded me of Irvine.  When we settled in and stopped looking at all the black & white \"faux\" Brooklyn framed photos all over the walls, we decided on sharing a large pizza, half with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and the other half with pepperoni. We also shared an antipasto salad, which was pretty good. Fresh slices of mozzarella, salami, salted olives, along with some toasted bread. It was nice way to start off the meal.  Unfortunately, the pizza was a bit of disappointment. Naturally, I had high expectations, having been to the Brooklyn location. The pizza overall tasted a bit bland, like it needed more seasoning in the crust. The crust didn't have that burnt-coal flavor either. But if you think about it, how could it? I was comparing it to the Brooklyn location, which the ovens have been burning since 1905. It makes a huge difference.  I even asked our waitress if it was True that they ship in water from NY. She flat out said no, but they do have a water filtration system using \"osmosis\" which replicates the NY water. Interesting, to say the least. I wouldn't say it made much of a difference anyway. Overall, it's still good pizza that I would rather have than something from Costco or Dominos or Pizza Hut. Prices are pretty high, however, but good for the occasional splurge. 3.5 stars.",

Oven was completely down as they were trying to cool it. My husband and i were annoyed, but we had no where else to be,  plus my hunny just kept drinking beer and was watching the Wildcard  baseball  game. As this was going on, the staff kept apologizing,  gave us countless orders of free bread, gave my husband a free beer, all because we were waiting patiently. 4 tables left that I counted because everyone was pissed. Well after a while oven was working and everyone including the manager busted ass and got all the pizzas out. We got ours and it tasted great. Oh and did I mention we also scored a free medium pepperoni because a table had left and they asked us if we wanted it, were like yeah!! So for others there nite might have been ruined but not for us and thank you grimaldis for taking care of us old faithfuls.",

If you're not a fan of chianti, they have a solid wine list & plenty of great beers to pick from, or sodas, water, etc.   Still have room for dessert? They have really good cheesecake and the dessert sampler is great to share.   I haven't tried the appetizers/salads, but they look good, and large portions (shareable).",

We ordered a lg pizza with meatballs. The pizza was excellent but i'm not sure I would order the meatballs again. Tiramisu was for dessert. It was also very good. Our server was outstanding.

    "text": "Surprisingly, my favorite thing about Vegas isn't the debauchery or gambling.  It is the fact that it's become a melting pot to some of the nation's best food.  Next door you'll find a frozen custard place imported from Utah.  You could also find some of the most popular burger places from NYC and Cali.  But what got me excited was the fact that at Grimaldi's, I could have New York's best pizza on the west coast!  In Vegas they actually have three locations.  I chose this location because of its proximity to my hotel and because of it's late hours (it closed at midnight on Saturday night).  What I loved about Grimaldi's in New York was its amazing crust, is fresh tomato sauce, and its fresh ingredients.  It was just perfect.  For my visit to this Vegas location, I ordered a Margherita pizza with garlic and  a pesto pizza with chicken and tomato.  Both pizzas were winners.  I love the pizza dough - it's chewy and it has a nice sweet flavor.  The margherita is a personal favorite of mine - I just love the simple flavor and the perfect balance of the tomato sauce, cheese, and basil.  My only gripe is that the pizza was that I felt that the crust could have been cooked a little more.   I can't really tell you with certainty how this compares to NYC, but I can tell you with certainty that I was so glad to have some legit NY pizza on the west coast.  Definitely give Grimaldi's a shot if you're not able to go to Brooklyn.  There are two locations west of the strip and there's a 3rd location at the mall that's across the strip from the Wynn Hotel.",

The base pizzas are reasonable, but can be exorbitantly expensive with the addition of a few toppings. If you enjoy a basic pizza then Grimaldi's is fantastic choice. It is just difficult when they offer some amazing additional ingredients. The White Pizza with Garlic packs on the taste of garlic and that is always appreciated. Maybe not for the people I am with, but I am never too worried about them.  Working in the industry, I know that no server wants someone to come in and share a small pizza, but I was not hungry. I just came to keep my friend company and ended up snacking. Our waiter didn't seem too happy about this and focused more on other tables. It was fine, because he did refill my water once and that was enough to get me through the meal. Other than that, he was pleasant and prompt with getting what we needed.  The parking is always a mess in this complex. A Tuesday night and it was packed to capacity. There isn't any other parking options, so it will have to do.",

Grimaldi's was chosen because it was close to where we worked and pizza was a neutral choice. The wait is usually about 30 minutes.   Once seated, you feel a little cramped. There just seems to be to many tables for the space. You're close to climbing over people to get seated or leave.  As far as the food, it's fine but not particularly tasty or inspired. The sauces are on par with any other pizza place. The salads are a good size. When considering sandwiches, they are big but coated in the same lack luster sauce. Finally, if you're having pizza, you better be in the mood for thin crust which will tend to have a little extra char than you might like.   Considering the pizzas are priced per topping, I think (and my party) were most recently disappointed with the spread of toppings. At $2 per, I was just hoping for more meat than we were presented.",

    "text": "I am not a pizza snob. To me Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominos, etc. is sufficient to satisfy my pie cravings. Thus I am usually hesitant to hit up actual pizza restaurants. Unless the place offers personal pizzas, you have to negotiate toppings with whoever you are sharing with. And I am sure we all have that friend who thinks anchovies is a must have. On top of that, pizza restaurants are comparably overpriced compared to their take-out/delivery siblings.  With that in mind Grimaldi's serves up some pretty good pizza, but to me fails to impress. Their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts. The pizzas aren't greasy or heavy, in fact, they only seem to have thin crust pizzas (no deep dish for chi-town peeps). They are a bit overpriced for what you get, and considering that they don't offer any custom or specialties pizzas, I'm left wondering I just overpaid for a simple pepperoni pizza.  I wish they had some more stand out ingredients or maybe a signature combo. I've been to this spot a few times and the service is pretty average. The patio is a nice touch but the restaurant itself is pretty small. Call ahead on the weekends as most pizza joints have a slower turn-over time and get packed on busier days.",

    "text": "I mean.. This pizza wasn't really all that. I would rather have Pizza from Costco. It's cheaper and tastes way better than Grimaldi's. Not to mention, the tables are WAY too small to hold a pizza if you're going with family. The tables probably would only fit two to three people at most with one single pizza. The sauce doesn't really taste like anything, almost as if it's been watered down. The cheese is a little bit rubbery on the pizza, too; not to mention, this is probably one of the most expensive pizzerias out here. The staff also never really listened. I understand that it may be busy, but when you're shouting over your customers and can't even hear a simple drink order, that's when it kind of gets a little uncomfortable. Most of the staff don't even seem like they want to be there.  2/5 would not eat here again.",

I have driven past this place a million times, but never ventured in because there are plenty of places to eat on Eastern Avenue without hitting up a cross country pizza chain. When in Henderson, on a Friday night, after eleven, the pickin's are slim and I was tired. I was \"pizza chained\" into submission.   I came in, bellied up to the bar, and ordered a Goose Island and Caesar salad. While perusing the menu for pizza options my salad quickly came and it was good. I mean it's a Caesar salad, with fresh lettuce and solid dressing. You really have to try hard to mess up a Caesar salad.   I ordered a personal pizza (12in) with ricotta, sausage, basil, black olives, with a pesto drizzle. This pizza was very good and also came out fast and fresh. The crust was crispy and the ricotta was the perfect addition to the marinara and pesto collaboration. This was plenty of pizza for one person and the perfect sharing size.   I like the fact that I can build my own pie and the process was mostly painless. Good pizza, not amazing, but I would come back for the service and the beer selection. Grimaldi's had done its job, I had a full belly, light buzz, and was ready for bed!",

Our server was nice and attentive. I liked the decor and the atmosphere but was turned off by the clanging of dishes and buckets as they worked hard to mop and clean. The floors were soaked. We could hear the cleaning and smell the cleaning product. This detracted from my whole experience. I could see if it was 30 min prior to closing, but we still had 2 hours. We had the margarita pizza which I enjoyed but it was a little thin. Guess that was just the style. I'd be willing to give it another try but I'd prob go earlier in the day, not as close to closing.",

The wait for food is never too long. This isn't something that applies to me at this point, but the restaurant is family friendly.  They are a little different than most pizza places because they don't have any suggested pizza combinations. All of the pizzas are create your own. You choose the size, base (red sauce, pesto, or garlic), and then the toppings. Each topping is an additional charge so this may not be the best place for someone that likes many toppings. I like the red sauce because it has a unique flavor that doesn't overpower the toppings. The standard amount of cheese is minimal which I like, but for someone that wants a really cheesy pizza you may want to choose extra cheese.   In addition to good pizza they also have some tasty salads like the spinach salad. The small is definitely enough for two people to share if you are also getting a pizza.",

    "text": "It has been a few years since I last tried Grimaldi's. And this is a different location than the first one I tried. This one I noticed to be much snaller. But I knew the pizza to be great thun crust style and thought it would be good for my family to try.  There were 7 of us last night. We got to the restaurant at what seemed like a late hour to me. Apparently 7:00 PM isn't really that late and the restaurant was packed. It only aboutb5 minutes before we got a seat though. They were quick on that. Unfortunately we were put into a small side room crammed around two small tables. Lucky for us we are a close family and didn't mind the close quarters. Ut got a little stuffy in there onve we all had a few drinks in us and hot pizzas in front of us.  Speaking of pizza and drinks, the food was the easy part. A Grimaldi house salad, a Mediterranean salad, a large The Don Pizza (pepperoni, sausage and meatballs) and a large with sausage and mushrooms. The drinks were a little more challenging. What beers do we want? Which wine do we want? Too many options you know.  The salads were fine. A nice variety of ingredients and a nice vinaigrette. We could have used a bit more of the dressing and my aunt actually did order some more on the side. Salad is just filler any how. It was the pizza we were there for.   Half of us ate the one with mushrooms and sausage and we all shared the Don. Both were really good but I think we all preferred the Don. The meatballs on it were great. A good size with a fresh flavor. Both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle. Being such a thin crust it cannot hold up to the sauce too well. The edges, however, were superb. Crispy and slighlty charred. Most all of us ate the crust and there were a few in the group who don't normally do so. What does that tell you?  In the end, everyone was pleased with the choice which made me happy because this family has a tendency to be hypercritical of restaurants. We all enjoyed ourselves, pigged out on some quality pie and teased the waiter a bit. He was cool with it. He was even laughing when trying to take the order of the group next to us. His quality customer service was noteable as was the service of the lady who brought our food. She cleared the table for the salad bowls and served up a couple slices of pizza to get us started. Good job all around.",

With few exceptions, the service here is always friendly and quick.   2. Fresh ingredients. Order the antipasto, you'll see what I mean. Fresh, cold, delicious salami, mozzarella, peppers, olives. From the gods.   3. Thin crust NY style pizza. Perfection.   4.  Huge wine list and choice of yummy cocktails.   I love everything about this place. I'm a fan for life.",

Now for a chain it is a little pricey, my large pepperoni, sausage and mushroom was $24. $16 for a large, $3 for pepperoni, $3 for sausage and $2 for mushrooms.  I think this is one of the best tasting chain store pizzas I have had in Vegas/Henderson. The crust was excellent, thin and just the right amount of crispy. The toppings were generous and high quality. The cheese and sauce were a perfect amount and very tasty. Overall a really well made and good tasting pizza.  I did take one star off as it took almost an hour for a to go order (apparently cleaning their ovens) and I think $24 is a little pricey for a large 3 topping. With that being said I WILL be coming back.",

    "text": "You might note that my original review starts with a disclaimer about my lack of pizza experience. I've gained a little experience since then, but maybe this place has worsened a little too.  A year after my first visit, I returned to Grimaldi's for another birthday pizza. I ordered the same large pizza (red sauce) with meatballs. From the birthday coupon, I got $19 credit back for it again. I think prices have gone up though, with $16 for the base 18\" large pizza and $4 for the meatballs. I ended up having $1 worth of pizza to pay.  Let's cut to the chase. Despite being quite hungry (I'd arrived straight from work), I wasn't very impressed with what I tasted this time around. The pizza just seemed pretty bland. Maybe some of the acidic tomato notes stood out, but not the sliced meatballs, and definitely not the cheese. I tried all sorts of condiments on top, including parmesan, red pepper flakes, and pepper, but I just wasn't getting much help. The table didn't even have oregano (or garlic, as I now recall) as it did last year, but I don't know how much those would have helped even if they'd been available.  I should note that I ate some of the leftover pizza after taking it home and popping it in the oven, and that pizza stood out in terms of crispy crust and just having more of the flavors. Actually, it tasted hot, as opposed to the warm-ish pizza that our server was able to touch despite warning us of the temperature. I'm guessing that there was a delay at the restaurant from oven to table due to the hectic service during the already crowded dinner hours, and that lessened the experience.  I would have considered keeping my rating at four stars for the pizza, but I also tried a dessert trio ($10) with half-sized portions of the tiramisu, Oreo cheesecake, and seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. Perhaps the latter was the most flavorful of the bunch, but again, they all seemed a little too bland and fleeting in flavor. The number of superior versions of all of these desserts outweigh the misses, so I can only conclude that the desserts are below average. I'd rather have the tiramisu at Trattoria Nakamura-ya again, the pumpkin cheesecake from Lazy Dog, or pretty much any slice from Cheesecake Factory (a place that's not even top of the line, mind you).  I'll be back in a year, but I won't be too enthused. Furthermore, I'm not even going to consider returning until then. On top of having had good experiences at Flour & Barley (via a Yelp event) and Little Tony's, I know that I can customize a far more complex and delicious pizza at Blaze Pizza not too far down the street. I simply can't see the same luster in Grimaldi's as I did before.",

We got the Brooklyn Bridge. It had a nice flavor between the meat and the sweetness of peppers. The one big downfall for me was that it is too small of a place for as busy as it is which makes it entirely too noisy. With that said we would visit again. Maybe on a week night to see how it goes.",

This time we ordered spicy chicken, sun dried tomatoes & spinach and I don't know if I'll ever ordered another variation. It was perfection!   I also love the Layer Cake Malbec and we couldn't leave without an order of cheesecake for takeout. So yummy! The service was great. Kimberly was very attentive & friendly.

    "text": "I hate leaving anything but five star reviews. In fact- it seems to be the only reviews I ever post. But I felt I had to share my experience.   I had heard so many great things about Grimaldis, and I had been craving coal fired pizza for a while. We were anticipating this pie for quite some time, as we planned out a pizza night with our good friends a week prior to finally ordering.   I would like to disclose we did do take out. So that could very well be why our pie was unsatisfactory.  We ordered two large pizzas. One pepperoni and one veggie pizza. Our total was $50. This seemed on the higher side for two large pies, but we were okay with the price due to what we were anticipating. We picked up our two pizzas right on the estimated time, and brought it directly home. I live about five minutes away. We immediately served the pizza to our hungry pizza loving group to find that our pies were rather soggy. The outside of the crust (where you would hold the pizza) had a nice solid texture and char, but the rest of piece was Almost raw as you moved towards the middle of the slice. The dough underneath felt wet- If that makes sense? I couldn't even pick mine up because it had no form. In my past experiences with coal fired pizzas- I've never had one that was soggy. I was really sad because i was hoping for that crispy charred yet chewy crust. We kept in mind that this could have been because it was boxed to go- but I can't help but compare it to other pizzas I've ordered to go and did not have this same issue.  Also- our pies did not sit for long.   The pizzas were beautiful, and the size was nice.  It could have had an off night, but I don't think we will be ordering out from this spot again. Sad we had such mediocre pizzas.  Hope you all have better experiences!",

She was helpful, describing many of the menu options with great, concise detail. She was very patient with our inexperienced selves haha!   We went basic and ordered a 12\" classic pizza with two toppings (italian sausage and spinach). It was quite filling for the both of us! They're NY-styled pizza was great! Not too crunchy and not too thin. Sauce was good and so were the toppings on it; an overall good combination in my opinion. Oh I almost forgot to mention, the food runner was friendly too! He helped served our slices!  Overall great dining experience! And not too bad for 2 people and spending under $20. If it weren't for Lindsey's great hospitality, the experience would have been average. I look forward to eating at this Grimaldi's someday again!",

They are truly the bomb!  My last adventure here was last night, but not as a customer in the traditional sense. I work for PostMates as a delivery driver & was picking up an order for a regular customer of mine.The 'take out' staff was extremely helpful, thorough & made sure my order was perfect. While it means a lot to me as a delivery driver, it means so much more to my/their customers. No missing items, always crushed pepper & parm, utensils, etc. They make my job EASY. If you want to find out for yourself, just download the app and put in code KCOLE for $10 in delivery credit. Not only will you be getting some of the best pizza in town, you'll be getting some of the best service as well.",

Now that's service!   The food is spectacular. The pizzas are filling - I was full after two slices, whereas with a typical pizza I can easily eat 3-4 pieces.   You must try the cheesecake. Our table tried the traditional cheesecake and the Oreo cheesecake and they were both delicious. Like undo-your-belt-to-make-more-room delicious.",

Maggie was our waitress and WOW she was smiling, happy and gave us WONDERFUL service! She made sure we got everything we needed and the pizza didn't disappoint. I would give 5 stars but the garden salad was a waste of $11! It says it has onions tomatoes and green olives.... Where?!? We received 3 olives and barely any onions or tomatoes. I paid $11 for lettuce with dressing. That's a rip off!",

    "text": "So based on the pictures I thought it would be great. I was not impressed, got a pepperoni pizza(btw what is with the baby pepperoni) with half sausage, had to explain it 3 times till they got it right. Told me 20 minutes for pick up,   I arrive in 20 only to go wait in a 10 minute line for pickups. Only problem he was the bartender and taking other orders while we waited , clearly they don't care about takeout if they have no one dedicated to handling it. They had plenty of people there to help but no one did.  So when I got home I got a cold pizza with very sparse toppings, not much mozzarella, sauce that was way to sweet and crust was lame and too much of it, not a good representation of a Northeast pizza.  Also I guess they figure people in Vegas wont notice it if they serve stale cannolis. What where they 4-5 days old? I will go back to Carmines from now on.",

    "text": "My husband, a friend, and myself decided to go to Grimaldi's last night. It was not my first go - round at this amazing pizzeria. I have a long history with Grimaldi's since they first came to Vegas. We usually pick up and take home.  I feel they can do no wrong. The service is stellar, the food is great, and the place is poppin'. It isn't a large location, so if they get busy you may have to wait. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait, which was fine with us. We went to the bar outside (it has one side outside and one side in). We ordered drinks from (I believe her name was) Shandra and her service was fast and super friendly. I also started with a small Mediterranean salad no onions (devil's food).  The oven they cook in is a coal brick oven. The pizza comes in different sizes small, medium, and large. You can get tomato sauce, white pizza, or pesto. We get the large white pizza with pepperoni and fresh tomato all the time. Last night we added ricotta cheese on half. The second pizza we got was a large white with meatball, fresh tomato, mushrooms, and added ricotta on half. Why half you ask? Well, I am not a fan of ricotta at all. BUT let me tell you, their ricotta is the exception to everything I know about ricotta cheese. It is smooth, creamy, and not gritty at all.  Of course it was delicious as always. The biggest downfall is you will pay $2-$4 per topping you get. We spent $100 with tip last night. It is expensive, but not a typical trip cost for my hubby and I. Normally it's around $25 plus tip for our regular. We didn't get dessert last night, but I have had their cheesecake. Holy moses it's delicious.   I cannot say enough about Grimaldi's. If you haven't been, you need to go. Like, now.",

    "text": "So we ended up here because the link at the Mexican grille next door was too long. My husband recently had his wisdom teeth pulled, so we were hoping to find some pasta instead of just pizza. Unfortunately, it was only a pizza place, but it smelled good so we stayed. We ordered the caprese appetizer. It came with tomatoes that were hard and unripe. The cheese and basil were good, but the server brought the oil and vinegar, instead of it having any type of balsamic vinaigrette for dressing. We asked for it, but she seemed perplexed. Finally got that. Ordered a 16-inch pizza (they come with a thin crust) with onions and mushrooms. The pizza arrived quickly, probably because it was undercooked. We were surprised to see the crust on the outside was done, but underneath the toppings, the dough was raw. The mushrooms had zero flavor, as did the sauce, and the cheese was minimal and also flavorless. The onions were cut in too large pieces, and also seemed to have zero taste. We showed our server that it wasn't done, and she said it's because of the mushrooms. Really? I have mushrooms on pizza all the time, and the dough is never raw. I'm also kind of amazed she didn't tell a manger to come to our table who might address the issue. The server was nice, but might have been new because she was kind of clueless.  Ate some of the toppings but left all the crust. We ordered the blueberry cheesecake for dessert, and it was actually good.  Needless to say, we won't be back here. Joey's pizza up the hill on Eastern is WAY better, or just go to Pizza Rev where you can get exactly what you want for a great price and taste.   Not sure how this place got such good reviews on Yelp.  NOTE: I was contacted by the manager regarding our bad experience and was offered complimentary meals to try again, which we will do in the future. I won't amend this review yet. When I try it again, I will keep you posted. I will give the management credit for responding quickly and more than appropriately.",

My expectations of a restaurant start with how long it takes to get seated, how long it takes before we are greeted by our waitress, how long it takes to get our food and if our waitress follows up with how are meal is and if are drinks are full. In my opinion, Grimaldi's surpasses all expectations. This particular restaurant is great and this is why.  1. Staff was prompt and friendly 2. Food is amazing and love the decor 3. Management came to our table on more than one occasion to see if we were   enjoying our food and if we needed anything. It had a family feel as if your grandmother was making sure you were taken care of.  My wife and I get our pizza with pepperoni and extra basil, it is simply fantastic but the plain cheese and basil is more that satisfactory. get the large, it is only $2 more. We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more. There was an older couple next to us that looked as if they were from Duck Dynasty or some other hillbilly lifestyle. They were basically old school Vegas and I thought it was fantastic that this nice restaurant was a place of diversity where you can see a redneck, someone in a suit or a family. Great food is for all to enjoy.",

The antipasto had an OK selection of fresh mozzarella, roasted red pepper, salami and some crostini. We ordered the large 18\" traditional red sauce, mozzarella, basil and added Italian sausage, mushrooms and olives. The pizza came quick and the service in the restaurant was excellent. The pizza had that great coal oven smokiness and just the right amount of char on it add that rustic pizza history piquant to it. The right amount of crispiness and chew to it that make eating a slice satisfying for texture foodies. The sauce was mild, not salty and a little flat in comparison to other artisan pizza places. The cheese was ooey, gooey and not greasy. Overall the pizza was real good and was made a tad bit better with some sprinkles of dried oregano and grated Parmesan cheese. I am glad I had this on my list of places to try.",

    "text": "$45 for a small \"Mediterranean\" salad that had a sprinkle of feta 3 red onion rings and 8-10 kalamata olives and 2 cucumber slices sectioned into 1/8ths and a large pizza is really expensive.   I got a pesto pizza with chicken ($5 topping) it's Sysco chicken pieces folks not real chicken breast and not worth $5) artichoke hearts $3 sun-dried tomatoes 2 or  3 bucks and red onions that's right another 2 dollars.   The pizza overall was OK good crust but not a good value for the money. If they want to charge that much for toppings they should seriously address the quality. Verrazano's makes a better pie IMO for a LOT less money. Don't think I'll be ordering again.",

I said two with no greeting and says right this way. The staff seems unfriendly and the server never makes conversation at all. As for the server lets just say that the dead has a better personality. We all know the servers work hard for their tip but unfortunately the servers has no personality to even remotely get a tip. So in other words here's a tip loosen up because you are make the customers uncomfortable. The staff in Summerlin is nothing compared to this type of service provided. Servers are snobbish to the bussers. Management should really improve this type of environment.",

My favorite was the white pizza because the garlic really brought out the flavors. The italian sausage reminded me more of mini meatballs than actual sausage.   Just a note, the \"Personal\" pizza is quite large. It's actually six decent sized slices from the usual 4 mini slices that I've seen at other pizza joints. It made a good light lunch for two.   This isn't one of those cheap $2 a slice pizza joints. Come here for a good NY style pizza. Can't wait to come back and try something else.",

    "text": "I've been to the Eastern/Green Valley and Summerlin location several times. I love the pizza and salads and wine selection. Food was great tonight! The hostess was amazing! She remembered my name up until the moment we walked out (impressive). Typically, service is decent. However, after tonight, I feel compelled to write this review. Our waitress was Stephanie. She started out good, chatted with us about opening the bottle of wine, then when she was done, I asked her to bring us some silverware. She never did remember to bring the silverware. I had to get up and go to the hostess stand, after the salad arrived, to get my own. Then when the pizza came, she took my dirty plate but took a while to come back with the new plate. After finishing my first piece without a plate, we had to flag her down to get the plate (she forgot that too). At one point, she asked, \"did they ever offer you oregano or garlic\"? We were thinking, 'who are THEY, isn't she our server'? When we answered, \"no,\" she never did ask if we'd like some, then turned and walked away. She also never refilled the water.  We completed a comment card and took it to the hostess stand and asked that it be delivered to the manager. We saw our waitress run over to read it, along with the rest of the girls at the hostess stand.  Will I go back again: Yes! I do love the food. I'm hoping; however, that service gets better. Being in the Las Vegas area, there is a lot of competition, so one would think attention to detail is important.",

Would it be too obvious if I accidentally lick it? did I brig my taser?? TOO LATE!! your 3 friends are already going \"sparta\" on each other for it. Yep..that good son..that good.  First lets start with the flavor. Le awesome. Mia mamma ..this pizza is packed of flavor. Delicious sauce, and toppings are generous  but not lacking of tastyness at all. Enough sauce to let you taste the other ingredients making it a whole different experience  The size..well..well..  if you are not that hungry you can use the x large pizza as a blanket, tent, parachute, or to cover a small garden. thing is massive. And its perfect for my appetite. even the \"small\" aint small. And the calzone you may ask? yes that one is the size of a whole island. Holy impressive sizes batman!  Now, if you (like me) have tried the grimaldins in NY , then you 'll say \"well its not the same\" DUH of course it isnt because all the other components that make food delicious (water, air, bacteria , etc) are not present as it is a different enviroment/city. However it is hands down the best pizza I tried in this desert.   to top this, there are days that they do 50 percent off bottles of wine (tuesdays I believe) . Get drunk get full get happy.. man I should be writing their slogan! . Be aware that they dont take reservations and this place can get packed  Hasta la pasta....(see what I did there?)",

However, after a while the newness wears off and that person stops doing the little things. Why is that?   This describes my relationship with Grimaldi's for the last year or so. On my first visit, customer service was on point, the pizza was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't have been happier. Aaahhh, those were the days.   A few nights ago, my family and I thought we would try to renew that spark with Grimaldi's. Instead, we were treated with unevenly cooked pizza (kind of doughy, yet burnt in some spots) and so-so service. Every topping other than cheese is additional $2.00, so the bill adds up quick. Add in the $2.50 per soft drink, and I was starting to feel like the meal just wasn't worth it.   The caprese salad as an appetizer was a great start to our meal-although it could have used a little salt. The crust is so thin that the pizza gets cold fast - so eat quickly. I will give Grimaldi's a solid 3 star rating, but am starting to wonder if they have just stopped trying to do the little things.",

Highly recommend it for visitors and locals. Only downside is that I can't go back to crappy pizza anymore. Not like pizza hut and dominos were very good to begin with.",

Grimaldi's is in NY too.  They've come close to maintaining the NY quality 3,000 miles away.  It's not NY but its as close as you will get in Southern Nevada.",

I normally order pepperoni and mushroom at other places, but the mushroom makes the pizza a little soggy here.  Regardless, the pepperoni and sausage combination is excellent for me.  The mozarella cheese is unlike any other compared to the pizza places around here.  Plus, the pepperoni is fantastic, the right combination of spices and the tasty sausage complements it very well.  The thin crust is cooked perfectly, as it is not too crispy and not toooo limp and soggy.  As noted, I always get a large and eat the left overs the next morning or lunch.  It does not lose its taste.  I share the mediterranean salad with my wife.  The portions are huge, so we order a small.  The service is excellent here, but does get busy around 6-730pm during the weekends.  So, you might expect some wait time during those hours.  Great place to go if you have kids.  The waiter sometimes give kids pizza dough to play with.  Whenever I have visitors from out of town and want to experience something new, but don't want to go to the Strip, this place is one of my first suggestions, when they are in the mood for Italian/American.  The pizza is a little pricey if you compare it to pizza chains, but this place is well worth it.  The great taste and service is consistent, which keeps me coming back.  If you join their email list, they send you great deals, such as getting a free large pizza (dine-in) during your birthday week...",

With baby seats and extra chairs lined up against the wall........this is becoming a dangerous situation.

    "text": "Initial thoughts:   I was first told about this coal brick-oven pizzeria by a friend of mines. I do have the say the moment you walk into this restaurant it has a warm atmosphere. I was initially greeted by the hostess and brought over to a table. It had a large coal brick oven and they do change out the coals depending on the serving time between lunch and dinner. I made the mistake of going at around 4pm when they were switching the coals out. It has a nice bar that opens out to a patio area that is open during the warmer season. It has a good location but I had trouble finding it at first. I couldn't see a sign for it until I passed it.  Food:  I really really enjoyed their pizza. Whenever I go, I always get the meatball topping and it is superb. They take the homemade meatballs and slice them thin and place them as toppings. The crust is nice and thin and the freshness of their ingredients from the fresh mozzarella and their basil. The sauce is quite flavorful and tasty. I was talking to one of their managers and I explained this was my first time dining and he told me a little bit about where they come from. He explained to me that they balance their ph of the water to match it just like NYC. I was really impressed that they did that, as it shows a dedication to great pizza. They also serve white pizza if that is something you enjoy.   Service:  The waitress was very efficient. She took my drink order and asked if it was my first time dining. I can't remember her name but she was very friendly and knew the menu very well. I ordered my personal pizza and it only seemed like a couple of minutes and it came out warm, fresh and toasty. She did a wonderful job on asking about my food and making sure my drink was always full. Kudos to her.   Quality:  Fresh, fresh, and fresh. Their ingredients are not skimped on and you can taste the freshness in their produce and sauces. I don't think you will be disappointed.   Final thoughts:  Grimaldi's is definitely my choice for a sit down pizza joint. The freshness of their ingredients their warm and welcoming staff and their dedication to great pizza shows that their restaurant will be and continue to be successful and their patrons will spread the word and continue to come back. They obviously know what needs to be done to run a great restaurant. I know I will be coming back and I will bring my friends along as well.",

    "text": "First, I have to disclose that I am a huge pizza fan and I prefer Italian food to everything but a good steak.  I visited the one in Palazzo shops.  loved this place!  The service was quick, charming and friendly.  The atmosphere and view from the dining room was awesome overlooking the Wynn.  But the best part was the Pizza, Thin crust, huge pizza for about 20 bucks on the strip???!!!!  Wow! The only change I would make is offer more variety with the apps.  But other than that, I will make it a point to revisit once or twice a year when I am in Vegas.  As you can tell I really liked this place and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes good thin crust pizza.  Mgmt got it right here, good decor, atmosphere, service and food.",

    "text": "What an impeccable dining experience my family had on a whim.  We just got to LV from LA and asked a local at the first exit in Vegas what's good around for Pizza.  We were pointed a couple miles off I-15 to this gem.  They do it up in a coal-brick fired oven.  Very good pie on a crispy thin crust.  Pepperoni's, cheese, and sauce were all very fresh.  The service was the best I have ever had from any restaurant including any 4-5 star expensive \"Morton's\" type places.  Restaurant was full but they managed to set up a table for our tired fam of four within 5 minutes.  Food and drink were quick.  They checked in on us a couple of times including management.  Just simply a perfect dining experience that I don't think I could re-create.  We felt like high rollers in a suburban area of Vegas.  Incredible!",

    "text": "It's getting more expensive to get good quality pizza anymore, but this place is absolutely the best I've had and worth everything you spend! Grimaldi's works as a spot to bring a date, friends or family and anyone new to the joint will be extremely impressed with you for introducing them to the food. The staff at this location is especially friendly if they recognize you as a regular customer. No complaints here! I don't spend in the double digits for my own meal that often, so when I do I'd like it to be a place like this. There aren't too many locations around the country, so if you live near one or are traveling to the area, and are hungry for a high quality pie - I implore you to go!",

    "text": "Oh my god, it was like i had died and gone to pizza heaven!   Now don't get me wrong i love pizza; from the soggy microwaved, burn the roof of your mouth off to the crusty over cooked, kept warm by a heat lamp baseball pizzas. If it is made of bread, cheese and tomato sauce i am there, and i am one happy woman!!  But the pizzas at Grimaldi's well you could prop me up at the bar and keep feeding me slices of heaven until i burst like Mr Creosote (Monty Python reference there kids!!) I ordered a large (tomato sauce) pizza with mushrooms, fresh chopped tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers and garlic...no meat for me folks sorry!! Also a caprasie (also known as a tri-colour) salad for an appetizer and a small house salad to go with my pizza.  The Caprasie salad ($7) was perfect to share and came with the dinkiest pieces of bread to top with basil, Roma tomatoes and home made mozzarella..yummy! The small house salad ($5) was again more than enough to share between two people and really complimented the pizza, the salad dressing was flavorful but didn't over power the dish.  And now we get to may favorite part the pizza, like i said i love pizzas, but this one has topped my charts! The base was beautifully cooked, it was a good thin crust hand tossed kinda base, but it was still soft and amazingly fresh tasting. They had amazingly managed to make it completely uncracker like which most wood/coal fired pizza places seem to make their bases. The \"secret\" tomato sauce was sweet with just the right amount of herbs, not over powering that it makes your eyes water, but with a damn good flavour! The toppings...well the mushrooms were beautiful, not gritty and not so small that you couldn't find them; the fresh tomatoes were sweet and juicy, the sweet red peppers...oh my god they were amazing a slight spicy flavour enhanced by the sweet roasted yumminess of the peppers! Lastly the garlic, wow wee it's a good thing I'm sitting here by myself as wow i can still taste the garlic and it's been a loooooong time since i ate it!  Well all in all it was a great experience, the total bill came to $50, and this included a half carafe of pg and 2 large glasses or Perioni beer.  So the down side, yes it did take FOREVER for the food to get served, yes the wait staff was not the jolliest i have ever encountered.....but for me the food totally makes up for it!   So on my recommendation, go to Grimaldi's order the pizza, salad, beer or wine...and just remember to carry a book and a bag of pretzels to tie you over until the really food comes out, because ladies and gentlemen it is totally worth waiting for!",

This review is just for the food. . A bit on the expensive side but worth it, I guess. You have to eat it ho fresh from the oven. Getting it \"to go'  is not the same as eating it there.",
