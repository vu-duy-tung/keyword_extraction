The portions are a bit obnoxious... they pretty much tell you right off the bat, \"the small is large and the large is larger\".... the perfect way to describe their portions. If you want to eat well but want to save on $$$, this is one of my top choices. The staff is so friendly and laid back, there is hardly any wait even when they're busy, and you can tell by their overall business during lunch hours that many others agree with this review ;).   I took 2 of my friends from out of state here for lunch today before dropping them off at the airport, and they were actually tempted to order more to go! In fact, the one said it was his favorite meal in Vegas so far after eating on the strip in major casinos all week. It is unlikely for someone to be disappointed with this place unless he/she is not a fan of Korean/Japanese/Polynesian-style food.",

Being from Hawaii as with my family we were desperate for a taste of home. Ross J's is one of the first Hawaiian restaurants in the Green Valley/Henderson area being around for well over a decade and we've been hooked ever since. They always kept a consistency of amazing tastings foods, huge homestyle portions, and all at a very reasonable price. My favorite is the Chicken Katsu & the Spicy Korean chicken. They also offer some of the best home made chocolate chip & Macadamia nut cookies up by the register(you won't regret taking a bag home). The Staff is always very friendly and again explore the menu they have too many tasty things to list. Not to mention eating here saves me money because I usually don't need food for another day or two if I finish an entire plate. Enjoy!",

Suffice it to say, I haven't had a bad meal here yet, from the Kalua Pig and cabbage, meat jun, teri beef, teri chicken, roast pork, chicken cutlet w/ gravy, mochiko chicken, spicy Korean chicken, beef stew, and the bentos...it goes on and on, with Ross J's delicious melting pot of home style recipes. But, I have to say that their Chicken Katsu is the best. Always juicy and the breading is perfectly crunchy, add the Katsu sauce and it's magical...instantly takes me back home.  If you're an ex-pat like me (c'mon, Hawaii is it's own country) from the islands you'll get it...Hawaii people perfected the plate lunch, so give it a try... Ross J's Aloha Grill no ka oi!",

The spicy Korean chicken is always a winner in my book. I also see myself getting the Aloha bento quite often which comes with teri beef, Korean chicken, a hot dog and mac salad.   One item I did not enjoy was the meat jun. Think thinly sliced beef in an egg batter pancake esque dish. If you're from Hawaii, you know how big of a deal meat jun is and Ross J's just did not fit the bill at all. Since moving to Vegas, I've yet to find a decent spot for meat jun. :( Guess I just have to head on home to get the real thing!  Otherwise, Ross J's is solid. I often call my order in ahead of time because they can get quite busy esp during peak lunch and dinner time. There is lots of parking. There is a gas station and Smith's just a few feet away so plus one for convenience!",

    "text": "Decided to check this place out since a friend recommended it and it had some pretty good reviews.   Playing it safe, I got the chicken katsu meal (regular size) and a side order of spam musubi. My first impression of the chicken katsu was that it wasn't as flat as other places and it resembled like chunks of chicken. They were either going for that rustic look or they just got tired of pounding chicken. Either way, the chicken was pretty tasty and I loved the super crispy outer shell. I also noticed how they used both white and dark chicken meat which is surprising since I am used to seeing only white meat for katsus, but it was good nonetheless.. The spam musubi was awesome, but my only complaint   was the overwhelming rice proportion to the spam. I was thinking about getting a side order of the macaroni salad, but I'm glad I didn't because it tasted pretty weird to me. Don't get me wrong, I usually love this stuff, but it had this weird plastic taste to it (IDK how else to describe it).   All in all, I'd say this place was decent in terms of the food, but I may come back to try out some of the other stuff. The staff was really nice and I only had to wait about 10-15 minutes for my order. The only downer is how this place is about 15-20 minutes away from where I am. There is an L and L Hawaiian place that is closer to me and I kind of prefer that place because of their delicious macaroni salad and cheap thai tea with boba.  I didn't take a good shot of the food this time, but hopefully you guys can get an idea of what I was talking about!",

My 2nd to last time went like this.  We called up and placed an order for a few plates.  When we went to pick it up the guy behind the counter got all butt hurt about separating checks and made it out like we were the ones at fault. They don't have a sophisticated ordering system. And what I did I get in return? A plate filled with a lot of rice and a couple of tiny pieces of their teriyaki roast pork. Tell me if you what this <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ross-js-aloha-grill-henderson?select=UkcdJ3gue48-9FRPJ31tTw#UkcdJ3gue48-9FRPJ31tTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ross...</a> not worth what I paid.  Their rice to non-rice food ration is pretty disappointing.  Who want lots of rice and a little of the good stuff? No other place does that.  You not inventing the wheel. 1 scoop rice or maybe 2 tops not half a pot. Your food is good but not that good enough.  My last time went better just because no one ordered ahead of time. Yea who orders ahead now days? Ordered the spicy Korean chicken it was good, it is what they are known for, but again I got nothing but rice and a few pieces of chicken.  I probably wont make the trip for them anymore but if I'm in the area and feeling like Hawaiian sure why not. Maybe even stop by after a movie or after drinking at the near by businesses.  Solid 3.5 star rating. Best in Henderson/Green Valley sure.",

I really haven't had anything there I didn't like. Had saimin noodles today and made the mistake of getting the big bowl - way too much, but it was delicious. The macaroni salad is simple and like that I've had at other Hawaiian joints, but for some reason - I could eat it by the bucket full. They also have lumpia! Anyway - I stop in every once in a while before or after I get my nails done in the same plaza. They have always been nice and consistant.",

    "text": "It's my first time here. I just decided to try this Hawaiian food restaurant and cannot be happier I did so.  The food is what's great here. This is a cheap and fast food restaurant, don't expect a fancy interior and top notch service, though the employees are super nice and they do bring you the food to the table. You pay at the cashier first and then sit and wait for the food, similar to how it is at Panera Bread.   The food cane fast and it was steaming hot. I got the combination plate with teriyaki steak, chicken & mahi and substituted the macaroni salad with steamed vegetables. You also get plenty of white rice in the plate and some cabbage and they put a scoop of tartar sauce on top of the mahi fish. Everything in this plate was cooked well and tasted amazing.   I also tried their signature Saimin soup. It's a type of Hawaiian style noodle soup with some beef in it and it is delicious.   The food definitely gets 5 stars. I loved it.  My only small complaint is they should have brought me the soup first, and then the combo plate, and I even requested that, but instead I got them in the opposite way and got the combo plate first. Go figure...  But this is not a fancy restaurant so expect some small misunderstandings like that.  Overall I really like this place and will be back soon.",

It is close to the Ethel M chocolate factory just to give you an idea of where it is located.   I ordered the Spicy Korean Chicken which came with white rice and macaroni salad. It is a huge serving that you can split into two to three meals. I ate all of the macaroni though because that doesn't keep well and it was too delicious to stop. Ross J's does a better macaroni than Baby Stacks.   The Spicy Korean Chicken was good but I thought it would be spicy I just felt a tinge of spice from it. I also ordered the green drink which is really sweet. It's like drinking juice from concentrate. If you don't have a super sweet tooth I would advise against it.   It was a good solid meal for a nice price!",

I've literally eaten every menu item they have, and it has all been very good. The food they make is the closest to the food I grew up eating in Hawaii, and that's probably because the owners actually moved here from Hawaii to open this restaurant!  The portions are quite large, and the prices are lower than any other \"Hawaiian\" restaurants in town. I had to use quotes because most of those restaurants that call themselves \"Hawaiian\" are places like L&L which are more like what Taco Bell is to Mexican food.  The service is always great, and the ingredients they use always taste fresh, never old.  I'd recommend this place to everyone AND their moms! In fact, I already have multiple times!",

But usually hole in the wall joints usually the best. I like the fact this place has good prices that comes with great food with pretty decent portion sizes. A place that you could come with a big appetite and leave full and happy. Two of my favorite plates to get here is the Korean chicken plate and the Ross j's special. Both plates are roughly 8 to 9 bucks but man, the portion size is huge!!!!!  Good for two meals or two people! Depending on your appetite of course.  Also I like the fact the cashiers are really nice people. You could also tell from the way they talk and there accents that the people here are definitely from the islands. This is one of the very few places in Vegas where you could get authentic Hawaiian food, good customer service, and if you come here fairly often. You are pretty much treated like family.

I still have a little bone to pick on in regards with their portuguese sausage (not flavorful enough to my taste) but overall it was a solid dish.

The very next night we went and for some reason fell in love with it.   We now frequent Ross J's and I realized tonight that I have never written a review. It's funny reading the reviews because it seems as if everyone votes for the Korean Spicy Chicken. That's the only thing I have ever had there and I love it. I have it with the vegetables. You gotta have the veggies. The service is great. The wonderful lady at the counter introduced herself once, but I forgot her name. I'll find out next time. They are not slow, but they do have to prepare the food so there is a little bit of a wait. I think I'll start calling in my order.   I actually asked about some other things on the menu tonight ,but ended up getting the same thing. Next time I'll be adventurous. Bottom line...the food is great and the service is great.

    "text": "Within 1 week, I have been here 3 times already.  I work near the airport on Eastern and was referred here by a student at my job when I shared my thoughts of craving for some \"local Hawaii\" food.  The parking area was under construction. Not good, if you've got a nice car, but that did not stop me from driving in and parking right in front. The decor of the fake palm tree and wooden tiki statue was a little tacky, but again, did not deter me from ordering :-).  I was glad that they serve breakfast at all hours, and I ordered, to go, the cornbeef hash, eggs over medium and rice.  The cornbeef hash is from the can (tastes like Libby's Cornbeef hash) Some people like fresh cornbeef, but personally, I like the one from the can.  I also got a bag of the almond cookies.  All of which was very good.  They also have Fruit Punch and LIme Punch, which we call \"Green River\" back home in Hawaii, and they carry the Hawaiian Sun canned juices :-).  My second visit, I dined in. I had the Spicy Korean Chicken Bowl.  Even for a smaller portion, it was still enough to fill me up for lunch.  You order at the counter and they serve you at the table. The chicken is boneless and not too much fat on it, which I like. I prefer really hot spicy, but I would consider this dish on the mild spicy side. I think my favorite part of the dish was the rice in the bottom of the dish that was smothered with the Korean sauce.  Today when I visited there for lunch, I had the small portion of the Tonkatsu.  This dish was also great. Good portion size, the tonkatsu was like a pork loin, so again, hardly any fat and the coating was nice and crispy brown. Each visit, I had excellent, friendly service. I keep forgetting to get their names, but awesome aloha vibes!",

The server, who I noticed had NO trouble carrying two dishes to other patrons all of a sudden needed help carrying two bowls that might have been manageable by using a tray. But the cashier had to help.   When that task was over, things had to be cleaned and receipts written on and rearranged, and finally I could order.  The bright enthusiasm that was used for the other patrons was not spared even a little bit for me. But whatever. I placed my order and went to the waiting area.  At least the server was a little polite when she brought me my order.  I'm not sure what was wrong with me but that attitude was not appreciated. I would rather have been told that they didn't want to serve me than to have had to experience that. Message recieved either way.",

It wasn't super busy and the service was friendly and quick. I ordered the Hawai'ian Plate and Diet Coke and the Mrs. had the same.  The Kalua Pork was the best part of the dish. I'd give this a 5/5 on the awesometown-o-meter of flavor. It was succulent and flavorful, something I long for in pork. If you are looking for properly cooked pig meat, come here.  The white sticky rice and mac salad were very good as well. The only gripes I have were that the salmon...basically didn't exist and that the laulau was just \"meh.\"  I'll head back for the katsu and kalua pork!",

From the reviews, most reviewers here boasts about the korean chicken. Because of the recommendation, we got the aloha bento which had the hot dog, teri beef, and korean chicken with a small container of their mac salad. We also got a teri-plate in addition to feed the kids. Portions are good enough to share and prices are decent for what you get.   However, I do think the korean chicken didn't taste spicy and there were way too much of the teriyaki sauce on top. So our bento and our teri plate actually tasted the same because of it. One of our mac salads tasted like it had pinch of chili pepper on it and an odd taste of mayo. Had to toss that unfortunately. The ladies over the counter and the vibe here (as well as the wait) sure does bring me back to the islands. They were helpful and nice. The seating here looks like its been worn out a bit and the wait here can be long.   As of June 2016, don't take Sunset because of construction. It also took us awhile to get back to our hotel. The good thing for us, we ate most of it while stuck in traffic. Their teriyaki sauce is not overly thick, that I do like.",

Walking in to Ross J's I already felt like I was in a locals place in Hawaii. How can you not love the floral and green booths?   There were 3 people ahead of us which gave us time to look at the menu. They didn't have kalbi ribs which was disappointing but I knew I had to try the korean chicken. I ordered a korean chicken and katsu combo which came with rice and mac salad.   We did not receive our order until after 12:30, more than 30 minutes after we arrived. I know this place was busy at lunch hour but more than 30 minutes for a to go order is just too long.   The food almost made up for the wait :) The korean chicken was very good, just the right amount of spicy for me. The katsu was also very good, nicely breaded and crispy and moist on the inside. I did not care for the mac salad, it just had an odd taste.   Lesson learned, arrive before 11:30 next time. Definitely worth a return visit though.",

Nice selection of Hawaiian foods.  I ordered the Combo mixed plate, which has teriyaki beef, chicken, and mahi mahi. Portions were ok sized. Mahi mahi and chicken were really good, teriyaki beef was thin cut and chewy. Huge portion of rice, small plastic cup size of macaroni. I liked that the teriyaki wasn't too sweet or too salty, and actually complimented the meat instead of overpowering it. Chicken was moist and flavorful. Mahi mahi had a tartar sauce on it that was also complimentary to the meat and not overpowering.   Just one lady working the cash register and the tables, so when I walked in I was 3rd in line to order and it took awhile. She was serving food, bussing tables, and taking orders. Busy lady!  I will come back and try some more meals. I did like it better than L&L.",

    "text": "My last update for this place was in 2009?!  The place is still here and it's gotten better and better!  The food quality and quantity has not diminished one bit.  My go-to order consists of the Ross J special and a  spicy Korean chicken bowl (meant to be a side but it is truly a meal in itself).  Other offerings on their menu specials include Tuna  Poke, soups, and eggrolls.   The Tuna Poke is something I've only seen more recently and it's quite possibly the best I've tried in this city.  It was extremely fresh, marinated in a soy sauce and onion marinade, and the pieces of tuna were cut generously.  The price was unbeatable by even the best poke shops in town.  So much value and so cheap, you should get this if you see it on the board.  The whole menu is cheap.  The food is the best.  When you order the Ross J special, you'll be wondering how they made their crispy fried chicken so damn good.  Their breading is just so ..good.  I can't describe it.  But no one else in town does it like they do.  The people that work here are friendly and serve you with a smile.  Since 2009, I've had the chance to try multiple Hawaiian locations for lunch and dinner and Ross J's is simply the best in town.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 6/100",

    "text": "During my lunch today, I was fortunate enough to chow down on Ross J's!  Love this place.  It's what I'm used to.  This, for me, is comfort food.    AMBIANCE: The place is like the typical Hawaiian food dive/diner.  There are booths and table tops, a self service soda station and is always filled with people, primarily from the islands.  If you are from Hawaii, it really makes you feel like home.    FOOD and SERVICE:  When it comes to the service, I love the \"local braddah\" with the backwards hat and bandana.  He's always offering the Aloha spirit to customers.  Never skips a beat when it comes to greeting people and thanking them for coming in.  This is what I've noticed everytime I'm there.  When it comes to the aunty with glasses and a small homeade flower in her ear, I think it's a hit and miss.  Today she was very cordial and nice.  Many times I have visited, though, she doesn't make \"small talk\" or greets you.  There's another Asian girl who takes your order as well who seems very quite.    Today, I got the Spicy Korean Chicken for $7.50.  First, the macaroni salad is \"ON POINT\" for my taste buds.  Seasoned perfectly and they package it in a separate container when you take out.  The chicken were boneless thighs with the skin on.  They grill the chicken with their Korean sauce.  The sauce is sweet and has a subtle heatness to it.  The heat doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks.  It creeps up but doesn't linger in your mouth.  I really like that component.  The portion was big and they placed the chicken over the rice so it absorbed the extra sauce.    I've visited Ross J's many times and must say that if you're looking for a meal worth the price, you must try them out.  I've had a lot of things from their menu.  For me, when I think of local plate lunches I've had back home, this place is pretty much consistent with what I'm used to .   The authenticity of food is why I highly recommend this place to Hawaiian local food seekers and enthusiasts.",

I like this place because they have fresh sides like broccoli or kimchee.  If you're from Hawaii, you know the islanders just look for their protein and rice, oh and Mac salad. Lol!    I walked in this time around and was disappointed that they didn't have the butterfish on the menu and then I didn't see any other fish dishes in the menu.  I was so upset that I walked out, however my husband stayed because he wanted to eat. He knew I was grouchy and hungry, as was he, so he actually had asked (unlike me) to see if they had butterfish.  Aunty said, not supposed to, but guess what, she made one for me!  I then got back into a better mood, oopsie.  Warning, they give plenty of rice.  I don't really eat rice and rice takes most of your plate.  They might be better off using the ice cream scooper like everyone else...haha, why not, right?  But that's my reasoning for the three stars.  Mac salad was pretty mean and I will say that I actually killed the Mac salad way before even eating half my lunch.",

First off, we ordered the bowls which were less than $4.00 each and with the veggies cames to an addition of $1.20 (or something like that) to each bowl. Pretty cheap huh?? Funny thing is that out food came in a regular container and not a bowl- so I don't know if thay made a mistake and it was my lucky day or if their bowls are really not bowls but regular sized plates- if that is the case then this place is a good deal!!! We liked our food -just wish it was spicier- I have try a pack of their Corn Flakes cookies some time!!! But several times I have asked the lady at the register if anny of the cookies are soft and sadly but honestly she said \"No, all the cookies are hard\" I love me some soft chewy cookies....  Anyways, I'll have to try other stuff on their menu sometime - I just can't help but order a spicy Korean chicken bowl everytime though- YUM - I wish they used chicken breast but they use chicken thighs instead. If they used chicken breasts (white meat) then this dish would be close to perfection!!!  I do wish they would sell Guava Chiffon Cake!!!!! More Hawaiian places need to offer this yummy cake - it's so hard to find and when I find it - it's not made right!!!  This place is set up just like other Hawaiian restrauants - with all kinds of yummy filling barbecue,stir fry,ramen,fried ramen,musubi's, ect... Right when you walk in you instantly feel the islands and you better come ready for some heavy grub cause that's what your gonna get.....",

    "text": "Quite possibly the best Hawaiian food place in Las Vegas,Ross J's Aloha Grill is located in the Green Valley area in Henderson,making it a bit of a drive for Las Vegans who don't live on the east side of the I-15 - but it is worth the drive,I guarantee it.   The service is always great; the staff very personable and friendly,as well as quick and efficient.  The venue itself is comprised of all booths,which I personally prefer to tables (there are a few tables in the back part of the restaurant,for handicapable guests).  The food - don't get me started on the food. In addition to being easy on the wallet,the food is freshly prepared and (depending how slammed the venue is) always promptly out. They have the Hawaiian staples - spam musubi,chicken katsu,etc. but what makes Aloha Grill stand out is their combination bowls (rice bowl toppings for under $7!) and the customer's ability to substitute the regular jasmine rice that comes with their meal for Aloha Grill's pork fried rice (worth the extra $2,trust me).   A must try,whenever you're on the east side,definitely consider stopping in! Aloha!",

Can get packed during lunch hours and can be a wait, but that's because everything is made fresh to order so call ahead of you're in a rush. Lots of menu items, too many when your hungry and want it all! Too much rice on the plate and not enough macaroni salad, but they have lime punch! Worth stopping by for that alone and I could afford to eat less mac and more rice anyways. Much better than the other hawaiian BBQ options in the area. Always full of Pacific Rim natives so you know it's gotta be good. Local business, which is always better to support. Overall worth the visit, will definitely continue to enjoy for the foreseeable future.",

They have an amazing Korean spicy chicken bowl for $3.75, and it is amazing (I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy and this is perfect). Also, their spam musubi is on point. Hands down best Hawaiian food in Vegas. Large portions. Cheap cost. Great quality. Always a good crowd.",

    "text": "There are numerous Hawaiian spots in this area but nothing quite like Ross J's. This place has been my go to for my islander food cravings. Their Spicy Korean Chicken is to die for with the right balance (sometimes a bit too much) saltiness, hotness and overall flavor.   On days when I'm on a budget, the rice bowls always saved the day. You can't beat that under $5 menu.  The people at the counter greet you as you come in, like you were a distant cousin they haven't seen for a while. They treat customers like family. That's the island way.  I can say I've been a legitimate Duke of this hole-in-the-wall establishment for a good few months. I actually sit here and dine; unlike some who just check-in here to get Yelp brownie points without buying anything.  I'm writing this review while I enjoy perhaps what could be my last meal at Ross J's before I move out of state. Too bad where I'm going there isn't a place quite like this. The haole in me will be missing the Spam Musubis, hot steaming Saimin, well done Teriyaki beef and the Mac Salad. Oh my God let's not forget the Mac Salad!  Whenever I visit Vegas I know one place I'm definitely stopping by. Mahalo nui loa Ross J crew, your food definitely made this haole's 5 year stint in Vegas more wonderful.  Sincerely,  The guy who rides that white bike.",

I'm not at all enthused with the old decor, dirty walls and spotted stainless steel area where the drinks are, but the food was good.  When I enter a hole in the wall Resteraunt I expect it to be far less than perfect, however I do expect cleanliness. This place wasn't clean ( at least to my expectations.) The dirty and spotted stainless steel was kind of gross to be honest, especially because it was near the soda machine. Now if you watch \"dirty dining\" you l ow the moldy or gunky soda machine is an imminent health hazard. That being said, I didn't see the inside of the machine so I couldn't tell you if that's the case, but the surrounding area wasn't appealing and it made me wonder!   I ordered chicken katsu,the small size, and the portion was more than enough. One breaded chicken piece with a lot of white rice and a small side of Mac salad will fill up anyone. The katsu breaking was yummy and crispy and the rice was perfect. The sauce wasn't the best I've had but wasn't the worse either. Again, portions were right and I was pleased with the food overall!  I did make sure to see if this place had an \"A\" rating when I left, and it did! I'd go back honestly. So I'm not terribly concerned with food contamination. The place had a lot of customers.  Advise to the owners- clean the dining room more frequently and use food area approved cleaner on your stainless steel! Looks can be deceiving!",

Well anyways, when we arrived at Ross J, we ordered the Spicy Chicken Bowl with added mixed veggies, Roast Pork Plate, and a drink.  It came out to $15ish.  I told my bf that she must charged him for the Roast Pork under the \"ENTREE\" heading ($7.50) instead of the roast pork that we noted under the \"PLATE\" heading ($4.50).  He inquired with the cashier and she firmly said \"Well when you said roast pork plate, it is the 'ENTREE'\".  He, being the friendly one in this relationship, accepted it because he was hungry regardless.   The food was ok.  I must agree with everyone about how cheap the spicy chicken bowl is.  I do want to come back to try the corned beef hash, and when I do, I will update my review as I see fit.",

I never have seen this on the menu!  I know they have ahi poke on Fridays but I guess sashimi on Sundays works for me!   The fish was sooooo fresh (see picture) it melted in our mouths and tasted amazing.  The chicken was good, tasty and the skin so deliciously crispy (and I love those green onions).  I highly recommend visiting this charming place and remember, they take credit cards so have no fear :0) plus they carry Coke products yay!",

We were in a rush to meet up with my family so we were going to quickly eat in the restaurant and then go.  I'm guessing they had a new cashier girl because after we picked up our food and we were almost done eating, she told us that we couldn't eat at the diner if we did a pick up order. Keep in mind, there was a couple of open tables for others to eat as well. Also, we have done it multiple times where we did a pick up order and ate in the restaurant.

They always have specials going on that are super cheap. Usually crowded in the morning on a weekend so I'd recommend going during the week. My favorite breakfast is the scrambled eggs with the Portuguese sausage and white rice. Definitely the place to go for a cheap delicious meal!",

The food portion and flavor are exactly like Home \"kauai\". If u are from Hawaii and have not yet gone to this spot, u betta go. And if anyone that is not from Hawaii but wants to get a taste of it, this is it. Place is always busy and but the food comes out with good timing. Will recommend this to everyone! If u don't kno what to order, get a loco moco. U can never go wrong with that.",

It makes the grad student in me cry tears of joy just by looking at the prices.  I usually get the Spicy Korean Chicken Bowl ($3.85) with broccoli (an extra $1.35-ish?), so for a little over $5, I'm full for at least two  meals. You can take home half and it'll be substantial enough for another full meal, or you can do what I did yesterday and just ate the entire plate. The chicken is soft and tender, and it's on top of some sweet teriyaki-esque sauce & rice. I just don't know how they make it taste so good. The only thing is that it does take about 5-10 minutes for them to cook the chicken and steam the broccoli, so if you want a to-go order, you can just call ahead.  This place is very straight to the point. It doesn't try to sell you with really aesthetic decor, special deals, or heavy social media presence because frankly, it doesn't need to. The quality and flavor of the food alone will make you a believer in Ross J's. There isn't much more to say but that you should stop reading my review, get in your car, and go get a plate of that Spicy Korean Chicken.",

So plan accordingly when you come during the busy times. You can also call in for a pick up, which a lot of people seem to do.   The food is delicious, cheap and you get huge portions. What we usually get are the beef stew, chicken Katsu, meat jun, spicy Korean chicken, Ross j special, and the 2 eggs with rice and Portuguese sausage. The beef stew, spicy Korean chicken and Ross j are our favorite. Depending on how hungry you are you can get the spicy Korean chicken plate which is $7.99 or the bowl which is $3.85. The Ross J special is $8.99 and it  includes Teri steak, mahi mahi, fried chicken, rice and mac salad.",

I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor in the Korean chicken and bland meat jun that was partially raw. Met jun should never be a little raw since it is a thin slice of meat. I'm not sure if they were just rushing our order out, but I don't mind a wait for food to be thoroughly cooked when it needs to be.  The restaurant also needs a little TLC with the paint and cleaning.  The staff were awesome and the choices they offer are good especially for the price but maybe that could why the flavor is a little lacking. This place is better than the Chinese Hawaiian BBQ places. Hopefully this experience was a fluke and never happens again.",

It's located in the Smith's shopping center on Sunset and Sunset, across from the Ethel M Chocolate Factory.  Be mindful that this place is ALWAYS BUSY! Especially so during lunch time!    My favorite thing to get is their Spicy Korean Chicken bowl.  The chicken is sweet, spicy, crunchy..all that good stuff!  It comes with rice, but it's also good if you substitute noodles for the rice.  You can also add on some veggies to complete the meal.  It is my favorite thing to order on the menu!    Their musubi are great too!  They offer spam, Portuguese sausage, and chicken musubi for less than $2.  The last time I ordered 10 of them and 2 hours later, when I opened the styrofoam, they were still fresh and hot!     Portions are huge and prices are cheap!  They also have Hawaiian Sun juices to enjoy with your meal.    The only thing they get mad about is eating in the restaurant while ordering to go.  So when they ask you if you're dining in or taking out, make a decision and stick with it.",

After trying non chain hawaain places, I'll never settle for L and L or Aloha kitchen if I have the choice.  For take out I got the chicken Katsu plate with fried rice and a side of spicy Korean chicken.  I didn't get to eat it super fresh since it was a drive back to the office.  I will say, I've had better Katsu chicken and I've also had better fried rice.  They unfortunately forgot my sauce for my Katsu so I was pretty disappointed..  The spicy chicken was good but for the meal, I'd have to say I'd need to eat their food fresh to make an opinion.  That brings me a week later to dinner with my friend.  My Spicy Korean Chicken came out on a huge plate and I had a side of veggies for an extra dollar.  I know everyone has their preference of type of meat for their chicken.  Although fatter, I prefer dark meat!   They grill the skin side down so it's crisp and it's really good.  The chicken bowls are around four bucks and for the plate of food it's a good value.  Food came out quick.  And even with the four items for take out, the ready time was only five minutes and it took me longer to drive their :P   For them forgetting my sauce I have to take a star off.  You'd want your guest to enjoy their meal wether it's take out or dine in, and I was unable to do so because they forgot half of what makes chicken Katsu: KATSU SAUCE :[",

A large bowl of rice is piled high with meat and doused with teriyaki sauce. I didn't know that there were no veggies, but they offer a side of them for an additional $1.   The service is warm and quick. It is no surprise that they have so many people stopping in to get lunch.",

    "text": "Hawaiians rejoice!  Another great place to get some ONO local food!  Those in the know are aware that the food at Ross J's Aloha Grill is very similar to the food at Aloha Specialties in the California Hotel because they are both owned by the same family (the last time I checked).  So the food you see at Ross J's for the most part you will see at Aloha Specialties.  This is good for the folks that live in Henderson that don't want to drive all the way to Downtown for some mighty good Hawaii-Style grub!  Save gas...save cash!  I love me some Calrose rice and macaroni salad when my diet allows me!  I hit this place up whenever I get to this side of town.  All their dishes are local favorites so I never have a hard time going wrong.  Popular of course are the Kalua Pig, Chicken Katsu, Chop Steak, Beef Tomato, Garlic Chicken w/ Brown Gravy (super ONO), Loco Moco (Hawaii STAPLE, duh), Teriyaki Butterfish, Meat Jun, and the Teriyaki Chicken.  Each of these plate lunches and more come with two big scoops of rice and a big scoop of macaroni salad.  Even better, all of their favorite dishes and Teriyaki plates are in the $7-$9 range!  So cheap for so much food!  They also do Menehune (mini) plates, and combination plates to satisfy everyones appetites and wallet.  Beefy on a budget!  Sweetness.  Ross J's also has gread noodles: Saimin, Won Ton Min, and Fried Noodles.  Always selling are their Bowls as well, my fav is the Teriyaki Chicken bowl.  I almost always get this with servng of mixed vegetables, and a Teri Burger and macaroni salad on the side!  Funny enough, this is my same order at Aloha Specialties as well.  Their Teriyaki sauce is addicting!  They also do burgers, and Spam Musubi too.    For breakfast, they got you covered!  Eggs with Portuguese Sausage or Spam, and rice?  Pork Fried Rice with Eggs?  Loco Moco for breakfast?  Sign me up, son!  Hawaiian Hearty at it's best!    Food is excellent, service is quick and friendly, and prices are good.  Visit Ross J's Aloha Grill and taste the Aloha Spirit!!  In the food, in the food...please do not taste the staff!",

I have yet to try anything that is not awesome. I usually call ahead so it is ready when I come, but even when I have walked in the food is always finished fast. It IS a busy place but they manage to take care of everyone at a steady pace.  All of their food is delicious, and the people who run this place are so nice. SO NICE. So what are you waiting for?

My Dad always chats up the cashier (Yes, he is the older, bearded man that holds up the line... sorry) and they are always really really nice to him. Oh, and the food is awesome too!  I like the Korean chicken bowl which is under $4, it comes with tons of food. My Mom either gets Kim Chi Saimin (Delicious) or a mini kahlua pig (Never tried, but she loves it), a mini plate or bowl is the perfect size for an average or smaller appetite. The mini plate comes with a scoop of rice and a small scoop of yummy mac salad. The spam musubi, fried rice and teri combo plates are also delicious. I have been for a late breakfast and enjoyed the spam and eggs. If you like good coffee, you might want to skip getting a cup here. I know I might offend some by saying that it would be nice if they offered brown rice.  Just a thought... Everything else is wonderful!  Enjoy, in moderation.",

    "text": "I recommend getting the Spicy Korean Chicken; it's the best tasting dish at Ross J's Aloha Grill.  The spicy and a little sweet coating on the chicken makes it taste super yummy.  The portions are large.  If you get the plate (comes with rice and macaroni salad), you get three breast pieces which easily makes 2 regular-sized meals.  I tried some other dishes and they were average okay (ranging from not so good to good).  The Ross J's Special Pack combination plate is an example.  It comes with teriyaki steak (ok), mahi (very fishy, probably old and frozen), fried chicken (tender and tasty), and spam (super salty).   I also tried the Kalua Pig and Cabbage and unfortunately, it was very bland tasting; haven't found any place in Las Vegas yet with good pork kalua or lau lau.  I agree with some other reviewers that the macaroni salad tastes strange.  It doesn't taste like macaroni salad from other places like L&L Hawaiian.  I can't describe it... maybe a strong industrial overtone to the taste?   It still tasted okay and didn't give me any issues.   If you don't like it, you can always request a substitution to something else like broccoli.  (Note: some entries like the special/combos don't  allow substitutions.)  Parking is plentiful in the large outdoor mall parking.  (Currently, they are repaving in front of Ross J's, but you can still park on the dirt or nearby on the remaining concrete surfaces.)    The interior is like a medium-sized cafeteria with 4-person booths and a couple of 4-person tables.  Once you are inside, go to the front counter, look at the large menu (and the temporary specials blackboard underneath), order, pay, and grab a table if you are eating there (the waitress will bring your food to you).   The tip box is next to the cash register. Portions are big so instead of getting a plate, you can get a couple of small/regular size items instead.  When the place is busy (usually during lunch and dinner hours) and the person taking orders looks a little flustered, make sure to confirm the order and double-check that the total price sounds correct.  They got my order wrong once and instead of just remaking the correct order, they kept pushing the wrong order onto me until I finally accepted.     Because I usually can't finish a plate, I usually order Togo.   I still eat there and then take the leftovers home.  Unfortunately, they told me once that if they run out of tables, they will kick me out because I ordered togo.  Doesn't make any sense to me because I could just order to eat in, ask for a togo box, and not have to deal with the possibility of being kicked out.  Duh. (I still tip even though I ordered togo so I'm not trying to avoid tipping.)",

    "text": "I usually stick to the chains of Aloha Kitchen or L&L when I am in the mood for Hawaiian food. Tonight I decided to mix it up a bit and try Ross J's.   I had planned on trying their wonton min (wonton and saimin soup). Unfortunately the broth is shrimp stock and I have a shellfish allergy :( I'm glad I asked. I also wanted to try the Shanghai Lumpia but I didn't see them until I had already ordered. Which was fine. I ordered a local plate which has BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, two Spam musubi and a scoop of macaroni salad. This is pretty much what I get at Aloha Kitchen minus the scoop of rice. I don't need that much rice any how so no worries there.  To say this local plate is a mixed plate is True on two planes of reality. There is a good mix of food with four different items. It is also a mix of awesome and a let down, sadly. To start with, the BBQ beef was hands down the best I've had at any Hawaiian place. It is tender and well cooked. You can taste the natural flavors of beef and the freshness there within. I only wish there was more than the maybe 6 or so small pieces. The chicken was tender also and had nice flavor. There was more of it than the beef. I take issue with the skin. I dislike chicken skin and will only eat it if it is crisp. Some pieces of chicken on my plate had a nice crispy skin. At least on one side. Other pieces I pulled off the skin. Its a textural thing. The musubi was fine. Tender nori. A lot of rice. A fair amount of Spam. A good example of what Spam Musubi should be. Then I get to the macaroni salad. I usually love Hawaiian style macaroni salad. The creaminess is unrivaled. It never goes to waste on my plate. But the macaroni salad I just had tonight I could not finish. Sure, it was creamy like it should be but it was also incredibly salty. I've never had a macaroni salad of any variety which has been so salty. I don't know if this is just Ross J's recipe or if it was a mistake but I could have done without it.    The service here is friendly but the food I found to be a mixed bag. I'm glad I gave them a try but it may be a while before I come back.",

For one, I didn't receive the friendly aloha service other reviews have raved about. The girl taking my order was more preoccupied with the cell phone pictures that the older ladies were passing around behind the counter. I took my order to-go, but was disappointed yet again, this time with the food -- it looked unappetizingly bland and thrown together, and a few bites later confirmed all of this. My dad ordered the same and he, too, wasn't a fan.   Other Hawaiian places often have the option of white or fried rice with their mixed plates. The majority of my platter consisted mostly of a sea of white rice with a drowning piece of teriyaki, chicken, and mahi-mahi barely surviving on top.  None of this was particularly tasty to me. The chicken skin was fatty and the teriyaki mediocre. The mahi-mahi was the only thing pretty decent...So no, no thanks.",

I ordered the combo teri beef and chicken plate and my wife had the garlic chicken we almost broke all of our teeth trying to eat the food.  The chicken was burnt beyond belief and supper dry, and the teri beef was hard and very old tasting like it was sitting around for days.  They gotta learn to marinate the meats in teri sauce made from scratch not from the bottle like back home style and the food would cook so much more betta.  Shoulda had the won ton mein instead, at least I would have broken teeth.  I'm 70 years old and cannot eat leather like the young days.  Fix the problem and I might come back.",

Very disappointed in the teri chicken. I make better! What I got was three fried chicken half-breasts that hadn't been marinated and were tasteless. They pour a syrupy, overly, sweet teri sauce over the chicken that also lacked flavor- didn't taste any ginger at all. Tasted like a ready made bottled sauce, just horrible. They must know how to make a better homemade sauce since they say and look local. The fried saimin saved then from 1 star. Flavorful, loaded with char siu, onions, carrots, omelet- quite delicious. I'll give them one more shot at impressing me-always give three chances-but at this point they've got some way to go...",

So many decisions, so little stomach. Luckily, there were 4 of us that could have tried 4 different plates. Too bad 3 of us for the same thing. The small Korean chicken was so fulfilling. If you get a small one, you should add some onions and mushrooms, it'll come out to be $5, definitely not that bad. Want to make it even better? My friend got it with noodles instead of rice. It was the best thing ever.   I used to wonder what was so good about saimin, if pretty much just ramen right? Nope! It was so much more flavorful!  The spamusubi also had a bunch of sauce, yumm!  Meat Jun: kind of a disappointment. Not as flavorful as everything else and it really just didn't stand out.  Too lazy to read this review? Long story short, get everything!",

I went in at 10:30AM (They open at 10) and the food was great. The pork katsu was a little on the empty side, meaning all breading and no pork, but no other complaints The potato salad was fresh and the rice was soft (sticky Japanese rice, not that dry flaky American stuff).  The restaurant is a little on the beat down side. Plastic bench chairs are ripped and everything is a little old. Maybe take-out instead of eating in? Haha.  I don't know if going in right when they open helped, but Ross J's has redeemed themselves. YAY- I no longer have to go to L and L (gag!) :)",

Maybe if the kid behind the counter wasn't playing with his kendama, the place could look much more cleaner and more welcoming. When you put the word, Aloha on an establishment, you expect to be greeted with some type of customer service, but that wasn't the case.   The spam for 2 of my kids musubis were under cooked, my fried noodles was wet, the mac salad had too much pepper, the meat jun meat didn't look right, the sauce for it was a bit spicy. Only thing that was decent, was the spicy korean chicken.   We're from the islands too, so we're all about supporting local businesses. However, we will not be returning to this restaurant.   Train the workers to clean while it isn't busy, instead of playing with toys. The chairs looked really nasty and could use some scrubbing. The table to the right when you entered was dusty and the floors could also use a good scrubbing as well. Some of the chairs were ripped and really just dirty, that even my 9 year old daughter was afraid to sit on them. Sorry, but I wish I had better things to say about this restaurant, but at the moment, I don't. I'm pretty sure the owners are really sweet, but this place needs some major upgrades!",

I've ate plenty of Hawaiian food over the years from L&L to Aloha Kitchen to the cafe at California hotel. This place is average. We ordered the spicy chicken bowl and the wife had Ross' special pack which was a mixed platter of meats. We also ordered two spam musabi on the side. Again, nothing stood out during this meal. Not the macaroni nor the flavor the meats. While the food was not bad, I'll probably not come by here again. There are SO MANY choices here in Vegas that I cannot see myself going out of the way to come here. The service was again standard. (At least they don't limit you to one refill, shame on you L&L.) The size of the restaurant was on the small side. This place had a steady flow of customers but there was always a table available. Overall, standard Hawaiian food.",

So when I jus happened to be in the area, there was no doubt what I was gonna have for lunch.  Came here at 11:30 and there was a little line forming already. Ordered my Spicy Korean Chicken with Mushrooms and onions. Threw some sriracha on there (which was on every table) and enjoyed how crispy the chicken was. The onions and mushrooms were the cherry on top. All of this was sittin on top of steamed white rice. I love the teriyaki sauce they put on top. It was just the right amount to bring all the flavors together like a very good orchestral symphony.   Service was surprisingly fast based off of the customers that ordered before me. Im actually glad I got in at the time I did because around 12, the place got packed quick! That's always a good sign of a good establishment.  Prices are really good for the portions that you get. What I got was supposedly one of the bowl options. Seemed more like a stretched out oblong plate. Mind you they have actual plate combos that give you even more food.  Since all I had was the chicken, I know I have way more reasons to come back here to try out the other great items. 4 solid stars.",

I'm in the area from time to time and have been to Blue Fin and Sumo, but never here until recent.  The food at Ross J's is comfort island food to me.  Here, you can get pretty much the same dishes that the rest of the Hawaiian joints have.  But here, the prices are cheap and the portions are huge. We arrived one early evening for a quick dinner with friends.  I ended up getting their Loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage Masubi.  Total came to about $7, which is a steal.  Both were full of favor and did I mention the servings?  My Loco Moco had enough rice that was drenched in gravy, topped with eggs, and complimented with two hamburger patties.  If I'm in the area, specifically in this side of Henderson, I now know where to go if I'm craving some comfort food at a great deal.

While visiting for dinner the wait was tremendous with an extremely rude server. He kept calling me, \"bro\" and never apologized for the long wait, but what made it worse was his blatant disregard for the customers waiting in line. Instead of servicing the customers waiting he was adjusting menus and you could verbally hear him making continual comments to the staff in the back.   Finally when he got to us he gave us a dead look, and after we made a comment about the wait his first response was, \"are you giving me attitude bro?\" I was floored by this extremely vulgar and rude response. All I had asked was if he was ready to take our order, I had been waiting for 15 minutes with only two customers in front of me. What made the issue worse was that my Father who was using a cane due to his recent surgery was forced to stand while waiting.   During the confrontation this \"server\" who chose not to serve the customers began to say, \"hey at least I'm workin', can't you see how busy I'm workin', you should learn to wait and be patient.. etc.\" Never once did he apologize, instead he continued to berate me as if I was a hebetudinous customer. This pernicious approach made my extended family and myself feel extremely uncomfortable, with even my grandparents who are regulars leave disgusted and sickened.   I teach and have worked in mental institutions, my job relies on patience. His aggression made my family leave. I left a note to the manager who was not working, only to not receive a call back or a formal apology. This extremely poor service should be noted, I will no longer recommend this restaurant to anyone ever again. The place is unwelcoming, extremely unfriendly, and their unorthodox \"service\" will make you leave. Never support his establishment, and please never recommend this restaurant to anyone you know.",

Unfortunately, the gravy was so bland it didn't taste anything.  I added soy sauce but it just wasn't the same.  Other yelpers were raving about their Loco Moco so maybe we came at a wrong time?

I swear I have become a fiend for their spicy korean chicken with extra sauce. its to the point where i will leave my house early for work just so i can stop and get my spicy korean chicken fix. I wish they were open later so i could eat it when i get off work. But i mean really the portion size is very filling and its beyond cheap[$4.05 for a chicken bowl come on not even subway can beat that]. personally i have tried the other stuff on the menu but me being such a picky eater that didnt go over so well but i will always come back for my chicken bowl with extra sauce.",

Went for lunch w/ the hubby after a doctors appointment & it's a good thing we beat the lunch rush!! As soon as we sat down after ordering & waited for our food to come, a swarm of people just filled the place in minutes! WHOA!!! I mean the line literally went out the door!  I ordered the menehune kalua pig w/ cabbage plate & hubby ordered the meat jun plate.  My plate was pretty good.  At least the kalua pig w/ cabbage tasted how it's suppose to.  =) I've tried other places, for example, Aloha Kitchen, doesn't make it too good.  Neither does L & L's.  The mac salad was a little too peppery for my taste.  I tried my hubby's meat jun & the meat was pretty tough.  I didn't like it at all.  I do plan on going back when I have the chance to try their other dishes.  Overall, the staff was real nice & the place was clean.  The menu had a lot to choose from.  Pricing was reasonable, about $8 & under from what I saw.",

Although the kalua pork was a little salty for my taste (I'm not a huge salt fan), I enjoyed both dishes.  I always substitute the fried rice - it is very flavorful.  I can't put my finger on what it is, but the macaroni salad has a unique flavor to it.  I enjoy it, but my mother was not a fan (more for me!).  My only complaint about this place is that they often have a large list of items that they are out of, but I guess you know that everything is fresh that way.  I'm a fan.",

I've experienced better.\"   Chicken katsu had skin on every piece, the oil tasted a little off, and they left in a bunch of lousy bits on the meat. My mother was actually gagging from one of the pieces. I pulled off a bunch of inedible things but otherwise managed to finish the rest. What I didn't finish was the macaroni salad, which didn't taste as good as what I'm accustomed to.  Portion size was about what I've come to expect from Hawaiian places for this price. Service was pleasant. Ambiance was mostly hole-in-the-wall, and I feel like I made a mistake sitting under the kinda loud and tinny mono speaker in the ceiling.  We ended up going somewhere else after this meal and paying for some better food to clean the palate. Too bad.",

    "text": "I'd like to start by saying that I think that giving Ross J's a 3.5/5 is more accurate than a 4, but I'd rather round up than down.  I asked the server what she recommended and she guided me towards the spicy Korean chicken. I'll break down my experience there for you.  Ambiance: The place had a family-owned vibe that worked for it. That said, it did feel a little grimy. I think they'd benefit from updating some of the booths or re-paneling the walls. It tips it over the edge of homey to slightly dirty.   Food: The spicy Korean chicken came with white rice, pan fried chicken, and mac salad. The chicken was pretty darn tasty and had a nice crispy char to it. It wasn't spicy in the slightest, but I can let that slide since it was still quite enjoyable. If I get it again, I'll definitely ask for a bit more kick. The mac salad was...interesting. It was seasoned with a generous helping of white pepper that was a bit overpowering. It gave it a unique flavor that I enjoyed, but I don't think it's anything to write home about. It worked well with the rest of the plate but I don't think it could stand on its own.  Service: The waitress/cashier was amicable enough, but they were clearly short staffed. We had to wait a good 10 minutes at the counter while she dashed around trying to get people their food.   Price: It was a little over $8 after tax. Definitely a cheap eat for the quality.  Overall, I'll definitely be going back their to try some of their other dishes. The food tasted very authentic. which sets it apart from a lot of the other Hawaiian restaurants in town.",

    "text": "Another Great Hawaiian BBQ Spot here in Vegas. I can honestly say that the Vegans are spoiled with these places!! Thats A Real Good Thing!!   Combination of Meat Jun and Mochiko: The main reason why I came here was to try their Meat Jun. I wasn't aware that another place other than my current favorite Haw. BBQ spot, \"Island Style\" was offering this dish. Well, the first time I had this I was Impressed and was absolutely hooked! Well, the Ross J version was a larger portion buy not by much, it was tender but not fall apart tender, egg batter was nearly identical in flavor but wasn't as fluffy and a bit oily. Their dip was also on the Spicy side which I did appreciate much with the meat. I would say \"Island Style\" edges out for the win but I'd have Ross J's any day of the week.   The Mochiko was something I've never had and actually the teller convinced me to try this over the spicy korean chicken (I love \"Island Flavor\" korean chicken). Well, the Mochi flour used to give this chicken dish its uniqueness was Awesome!! Tasty, Chewy and Kinda Crunchy!!  Plate came with a good amount of white rice and their Macaroni Salad had an evident sour creamy flavor rather than just the plain creamy mayo that plenty places serve it as. I liked their take on this one.  Spam Musubi: Typical and Just Comforting! I Love Spam!  Chill Atmosphere and Employees, Good Prices, Great Food!! No Complaints Whatsoever..",

I've had some pretty bad spam musubi in my life, so it's not often that I find a place that makes one of the best spam musubis I've had in a long time. The ratio of rice, seaweed, and that slightly sweet sauce that they add into the musubi is so perfectly balanced in taste. I'm sooo lucky this location is right next to my school. Spam musubi all day errryday! There is just something about Hawaiian food out in Las Vegas that has yet to disappoint me :D",

I have to have a backup plan for my wife and I whenever I get the dreaded \"Sorry we sold out of _____\". This happens so often, they have a white board to write down what sold out from the menu. 3. They can probably manage the cashier line better. It is faster to call an order in from the back of the wait line, then it is to wait in line and place your order. 4.

    "text": "This is the second time that Ive eaten here.  This time we ordered the chicken plate, mini Kalua pig, Ross J's special pack and the spicy Korean chicken.  First let me say that from the time we entered the place to the time we left, there was always a line to order. The person who took our order at the counter was the same person who was taking out the food. Not sure if that was the reason for the long wait in line. The dinning room was on the smaller side, about 10-15 tables. As crowded as it was there always seemed to be at least one table open.   Now for the food. We came here because of the fried chicken challenge that yelp has going on. So, the chicken was ok-good. I liked the crispy skin that it had. It could have been crispier but I liked it. The chicken itself didn't seem to have much flavor. My wife liked the chicken better than I did. It reminded her of the chicken she used to get growing up. My favorite thing to do is to take the skin and make a little boat out of it and load it up with rice and furikake. YUMMY! ( see picture) I would eat a whole plate of that if I could order it. Would I get it again? Yeah why not. Would I get it if I was craving good fried chicken? Probably not.  The mac salad was on par, which is good.   The Kalua pig and cabbage. My son is a kalua pig aficionado. He loves the stuff. I ordered him the mini expecting to see it disappear in a few minutes. To my surprise he had only eaten about half. The kalua pig did seem a little dry.  My wife tried it and she wasn't a fan.   Up next is the Ross J's special pack. It had fried chicken, Teri steak, mahi-mahi, spam, mac salad and rice with furikake. The chicken is the same as on the chicken plate. The Teri steak, I liked how it wasn't dried out and tough like it is at most places so that part is good. I don't really care when they cook it and just plop sauce on the top. That's just me. The mahi-mahi was so small that you could eat the entire thing in one bite if you wanted to. The spam was a nice thick piece. Overall it was a good plate to order.   Lastly the side order of spicy Korean chicken. It tasted to me like it was a nicely cooked piece of chicken drowned in spicy soy sauce. I didn't  like it at all. It might be good if all that was dumped over a mountain of rice. Oh yeah I'm sure that would be good but as I ordered it, no Bueno.   I must admit that when I went there I felt like I was transported back to Hawaii. It definitely had a back home feel for me and we did enjoy our meal. If you go order the green river.",

There are some problems though. 1) they are slow at the registers and the line gets long around 6pm when I was here it was reaching the door. 2) because they are in a hurry to fill orders I believe they cook the food fast and because of that it's extra greasy.  Some good things. The prices are very cheap and affordable but to each there own this is what I experienced here for my first time.",

Also 1 Day I was eating there and they keep the phone off the hook so if you're trying to call in an order, you're not going to get thru. Some extra cooks or wait help would help this place move a lot smoother. Or at least tell people in line about the wait instead of letting people stand in line for 10 minutes then when they get to the front, you let them know it'll be a 35 minute wait?

This place is super casual, food comes packed with flavor and the rice is so good!  How is it so good?!!!   For 3 giant meals with spam musubi the total came out to under $22!  They're owned by the same people as Aloha Specialties at California Casino, but portions here are larger and cheaper...and there's more variety!  I'll definitely come back.  We ordered take out and within 10 minutes, it was ready!  We got the chicken katsu, spam musubi, loco moco, and garlic chicken.  Garlic chicken was dark meat and packed tons of flavor with lots of brown gravy!  The chicken katsu was white meat with such amazing crispness from the first to last bite and the sauce was so bomb.  The loco moco could have benefitted from having the eggs cooked a little less (it was take out, so may have gone from easy over to medium in our car ride) and could have used more sauce.  The hamburger patty was a lil dry also.  Also, the rice is so good!    The venue itself is moderate size with enough seats for about 15 people.  It looks a little worn down, but definitely attracts many Hawaiians so their food does the work for them, as it should be.  Overall, such a steal for the taste, quality, and quantity.  We'll definitely come back and hope everyone tries this place too!",

I got a rice bowl with teriyaki beef, and added veggies for $1.50; my total came to less than $9 with my meal and a fountain drink. Lots of veggies, not too salty, and the beef was really tender.  Great place to grab dinner before checking out Ethel M's or seeing a movie at the Galaxy Theatre, also nearby.",

Ever since then I've been coming here every time I'm by this area...EVERY TIME. My all time favorite from this place is the Spicy Korean chicken bowl. The chicken is very juicy and the sauce they cook it in...wow! words cant really explain how flavorful it is. The white rice is cooked perfectly and definitely compliments every dish you get it with. I've been recommending this place to everybody i know and they've all loved it. After so long i have finally wrote a review and I guess the only con is that it set my standards very high, because i have tried other Hawaiian places and this place is without a doubt above them in terms of taste and quantity.",

We've also had the ross j special; it's a combo plate of teriyaki beef stake, spam, fried chicken, breaded and fried mahi mahi with rice and scoop of macaroni salad for 8.95. Filled me and my husband up. While everything was good, not amazing. I always regret not getting my fav. Spicy Korean",

Definitely reminds of someplace I might find in Ewa Beach or maybe even Pearl City. I have been wanting to come here forever & was finally in the neighborhood having my car serviced & happened to go with my boy Darren S. who lives on this side of town & is from Hawaii.  The service is great & the auntie behind the counter is really sweet & makes me miss Hawaii all that much more, not to mention the food. The Loco Moco with Portugese sausage was HUGE & on point. Very filling! The mac salad is also pretty decent. I am kind of picky when it comes to mac salad & have been disappointed by a lot of places here. Personally, I like mine the best ;) But everyone has their preferences, right? Oh & the prices...Chee Hu!! They can get no righter :P  Definitely my pick for Hawaiian on this side of town!",

That's fine we can wait. 15 minutes later we order, sit down, wait, get our food. My mom's order was wrong so we took it back and they fixed it. My mom thought her roast pork were bad pieces because it was kind of fatty and just didn't taste good at all. My Teri beef bowl was flavorless and I could just taste how bad the pieces of meat were. We got up and the back of my mom's white pants were stained because they didn't clean the seats. Very disappointing.",

The lady at the register had to clean the tables and give forks out & didn't bother saying to us that she will be right back.. why couldn't the other girl give the forks out when she gives the food at the same time... also instead of the other girl waiting for the Togo food to come out she could at least look at other tables that are needed to be cleaned and wiped down... I ordered a chicken Teri bowl, comb bowl w/ so icky Korean chicken and a spicy Korean chicken bowl & a side of kimchee... my bowl came like 5 mins later while the other two had been received ... the rice was hard & it wasn't enjoyable.. the spicy chicken wasn't even spicy, so why call it spicy? I don't understand... there are much more better Hawaiian places that serve better quality in their food... the bowls and cheap and all but the quality is what matters.. I mean if it took so long to get to table I would think that it should be enjoyable to eat... I've worked at an aloha fast food and the service I had done was different than theirs.. the other girl had her hair down and her hair was passed her butt.. unsanitary & never coming back!",

The lady at the front counter was sweet and friendly. The menu itself is mind-blowing.  I ordered a menehune kalua pig plate and a loco moco to go. I devoured that kalua pig like it was my last day on earth. It was so good. I've had better back home of course because this one was somewhat dry, but it still had that flavor, you know? Plus, I've been extremely homesick lately, and it sorta hit the spot.   I ate the loco moco just now, & I am not disappointed. It also hit the spot, but again, of course I've had better back home (but that's besides the point). It was still amazingly good.  Finally, the number one reason why I will be coming here often is because they have green river juice with unlimited refills!!! They labeled it as \"lime soda\", which I guess is what it is, but damn, it tastes JUST LIKE HOME :) I didn't see any lilikoi or orange bang, but they had what I think was fruit punch and other fountain drinks that you could also get unlimited refills on.   This is the only \"Hawaiian\" restaurant other than L&L that I've tried here in Vegas, but I'm sticking to it for now because it's close to where I live, and the food and service are excellent.",

    "text": "Life isn't a beach. It's a chicken bowl from Ross J's!  Ross J's is hella cheap, hella tasty and the service is hella friendly. Total island vibe I am feelin' up in here.    I could roll up all sweaty from the gym (which I have), roll out of bed with drool crust on my face (which I haven't) and I think the people would still be cool to me. They treat everyone like family. Hell, half the people there probably are related!  GRUB ON THIS: It's all about the Spicy Korean Chicken Bowl for $3.65. No, it's not that spicy, but it's moist and action packed with Hawaii 5-O flavor. Yes, the chicken has skin so I try to pick most of it off. The portion sizes are for sumo wrestlers and circus elephants so it can no joke feed me for 2.5 meals. Do add extra veggies for $1.10 more. I've also had the lumpia and although it is fried to perfection the guts just seem flavorless and not worth the extra fat and calories in my opinion. The chicken bowl alone is a mouthwatering meal not worth missing.  PEEP THIS: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SueEpC916vd8Lo3Lyl9_pQ?select=ZcrwnR6ltufG0cOoIfwGew#SsckYmGiLl6vAjmFl0kLLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/SueE...</a>  FYI: Take it from me. Takeout can be REALLY messy. The savory sauce MAY leak onto your leather car seat. Since it is 198 degrees outside here in Africa, Nevada you may want to keep an extra beach towel and swimsuit in your car. The towel will come in REAL handy about now. (The swimsuit is for spontaneous pool parties and/or mud wrestling.)    Ross J's is saving lives one bowl at a time, people. If you can't afford to take DA PLANE DA PLANE to the islands to get your Aloha on well whip out your board shorts and flip-flops and roll up here. It doesn't get cooler than this.",

If you plan on ordering saimin, I would recommend a small unless you are really hungry because if a small is what I ordered, I could only imagine how big the large is. Also, be sure to check out the Kool-Aid dispenser next to the soda fountains. Kool-Aid!",

    "text": "Tried them out for a Sunday lunch, and wasn't disappointed. As you might have deduced from the storefront, they are a real mom and pop, hole in the wall sort of place-- prime target for Yelping!   The interior has a decently sized area for seating if you so choose. I suppose dining out might be a nice experience as well but they seem to get lots of take out business from regulars. That's another thing...you'll probably see a lot of regulars in line ahead of you. That sort of following counts for something. The lady at the counter was friendly and helpful-- no complaints there.   We ordered some pretty standard staples; the chicken teriyaki with vegetables and the spicy korean chicken bowls. The \"bowl\" is simply a smaller version of the plate. Considering the portion sizes of their plates, the bowl orders were more than enough food for us, but if you are a hefty eater you may opt for the whole nine yards. I was a tad disappointed but hardly surprised to find that they don't offer brown rice. This is an AUTHENTIC Hawaii style eatery and the options will reflect that. That's not to say that they don't do some unique things here--the menu has many interesting choices on it that I will no doubt be back to try, including a beef rib eye sandwich and Hawaiian fried chicken. Hawaiian expats will certainly find themselves at home here.  As for our food, it definitely met expectations. The chicken teriyaki was not drenched in a nausea inducing amount of glaze like you might find at an L&L. Oh and if you haven't figured it out, this place blows them out of the water. Like seriously. The extra dollar for veggies was worth it but it would have been nice to have some broccoli thrown in there. That turns out to be a separate add on for another dollar. The spicy korean chicken bowl had a unique flavor to it but it could have done with a bit more kick...I felt I needed to add some Sriracha sauce to finish the job. Still, even with the extra money spent for veggies, this food is very competitively priced. You can  walk in with a five dollar bill and walk out full and satisfied. It may not be as healthy as a Teriyaki Boy franchise, (where you can get a low-carb bowl) but it is much tastier and worth driving out of your way for. This joint is a do.",

After standing there for nearly 15 minutes while the one woman bussed tables, fixed other customer's orders and cleaned, the guy in front of us gave up and left.  Now at the front of the line, we figured it wouldn't be too much longer.  We weren't acknowledged as the one employee continued to serve every other customer that walked up. She finally glanced at us several minutes later and gave us an apathetic \"sorry\" before continuing on.  After having waited nearly 25 minutes, we realized that even if we placed our order now, it would take way too long to receive it.  And so we too gave up, the second customer in a row to do so.  On our way out, I wished the next customer walking in good luck.  It's truly a shame, we would have loved to try the food.  It still looks amazing.  Perhaps if they hire more staff.",

Besides, they give you so much food that I doubt I could finish it all. I probably end up getting a doggie bag anyway. I tried a few different things this time   1. Meat Jun plate - Beef dipped in egg fried on the grill with a sweet semi-spicy sauce on the side. Pretty flavorful dish.   2. Portuges sausge with egg and rice - The breakfast of Hawaiian champions. !!!!  3. Tonkatsu (Pork) - Crunchy batter. Tender pork. You cannot eat this dish cold.They do not have the sauce with Worcestershire (like Aloha Kitchens) :-(  4. Fried chicken plate - crispy, tasty, flavorful fried chicken pieces. Tastes best when it is hot and sizzling. A little sweet teriyaki sauce will enhance and contrast the saltiness of this dish.  5. Ross J special - Teri Beef, Fried chicken, SPAM and Mahi -Mahi.  Warning: FOOD OVERLOAD. Make lots of room in your stomach because this will put a dent in it.   6. Spicy Korean chicken - You cannot go to Ross J's without ordering this dish. This is probably the best dish here!!!   Spicy Korean chicken to go please !!!!! Yummy!!!  Oh yeah...prps to the MAC salad. MAYO, Macaroni and more MAYO !!!",

On average $6 you get meat of your choice 2 scoops of rice (or for me i get the fried rice), and macaroni salad.

Anyways, the Bento (Ross J Special) is the one to get if you're undecided from the semi big menu. You get Teri Beef, awesome Fried Chicken, Mahi, Spam with Furikake on da rice. The fact you can combo anything on the menu like Meat Jun and Hamburger Steak, Beef Stew and Kalua Pig, what else can you ask for? Good portions, all local atmosphere, no Asians only working and cooking with Chinese specials all over the menu, just the pride and joy of \"Locals Only\" here! And did I say I never had anything I didn't like here, and yes I've tried a lot of the menu without being disappointed. Only bad is they close early on Sunday's but that's a small complaint. So if you like Aloha Specialties at the California Hotel? You'll love this sister restaurant because of the same flavor, the same same Saimin but bigger menu and not as busy from all the hustle and bustle of the strip.",

We usually eat there, or we take it to go and either eat at home, work, or drive 5 minutes west on Sunset road and eat at the park. Bought a musubi for my best friend and told me the style and flavors reminded her of the ones the make in Hawaii, so I guess it's pretty authentic.",

    "text": "I'd rather give Ross J's a 3.5 star, but I'll choose 4 over only 3 because the staff was nice and we liked the Kalua pork. I wish someone had mentioned that you can get smaller plates because the size of the regular plates is a little bit \"ginormous\". Granted, the plate looks large beccause it is filled with white rice, but you also get two servings of the main dish.  1) The spicy korean chicken was decent. Very tender. Must be chicken thighs because it wasn't dry. It reminded me of the General Tso's chicken I've tried from authentic, good Chinese restaurants because it's battered, fried and has a sweet, tangy taste that's similar. Seemed a little salty to me, but the rice helped.  2) Kalua pork would be worth coming back from Texas to get. The cabbage seemed fresh and the taste was better than most pulled pork I've tried....and I've tried a lot of pulled pork. This was tender and a little more smoky. Not sure what the seasoning is, but it's dead on.  3) The macaroni salad is a lurking heart attack. Very....very, very creamy. I had to cut the creaminess with meat, rice, and anything I can get my hands on. It's not necessarily a complaint, but just a warning.  4) Kimchi was good. Price was under $2 to add it as a side. I also added the Spam sushi thing, which I liked because it was different. Spam was a little salty, but hey, it's Spam.  5) Mahi-mahi was fried, which seems like a waste. The fish could have been cod due to the lack of flavor. Definitely won't get again, but it wasn't horrible.   6) Meat Jun...not sure what the fuss is about. It seemed like cheap chicken fried steak meat inside in a omelet and cut in strips. Teriyaki sauce was too overpowering. To each his own.  7) Fruit punch. What's up with the Yelpers saying this is great? It's Hawaiian punch. I can get that from the convenience store. The grape punch...seemed like grape Kool-aid. I'll stick with water next time, but if you enjoy very sweet punch drinks, knock yourself out.  If we come back to Vegas, we're definitely coming back for the Kalua Pork. The noodles also looked really good.",

    "text": "Here I go again, writing yet another review for a place that yelpers love that I did not.  Sigh.  I tried this place for lunch while running errands because of the rave reviews on here.  Because I'm a white Jew from Los Angeles, of course I know nothing about authentic Hawaiian food, so you don't have to listen to some random chick like me.  I was not really into the food, although as the others said, it was pretty cheap.  It was just too blatantly unhealthy for me to actually enjoy and I didn't really eat more than a little of my order.  I tried a combo plate that had one of the fatty pieces of dark meat chicken I have ever seen served in a restaurant.  It was if it had almost a half an inch of fat under the skin which just made me not want to eat it.  The chicken underneath was flavorful because it was cooked in that fat but it was just too over the top for me.  The beef was also a little too gristly, but the teriyaki sauce was nice.  The best part was the mahi mahi, but again, there was a huge glop of sauce on it that just tasted like some sort of mayo, and there was no acid in it to help flavor the fish.  Also on this plate was macaroni salad, which had the most mayo I've ever seen in a macaroni salad.  I love macaroni salad but they should be light and flavorful, not heavy and gloppy like this.  And there were tons of rice, which is ok but I had wish there were some vegetables to offset everything else.  I understand I could have gotten vegetables now from reading these reviews if I had asked but I had no idea when I got there that I needed to ask for them.  Anyway, because of the price I might go there again just to try the spicy korean bowl, but overall no, this is not a place I would frequent again, just as I don't eat at many places because it's just not healthy for anyone to eat that much fat in one meal.",

And if this is the closest thing to authentic Hawaiian food, I'm addicted!  What I don't like about this place, is their menu because they have so many good choices that it's difficult for me to decide what to get! I usually order Musubi--all of them are really yummy and the meats and rice are portioned well. I've also ordered their combination plates. Their teriyaki chicken and beef are grilled to perfection and are tasty! They are not oversaturated with teriyaki sauce. The Spicy Korean Chicken has a great balance of the rice, vegetables and chicken. I wouldn't say the Spicy Korean Chicken is \"dripping sweat spicy\" but it has a nice kick of spiciness to it that will leave you wanting more.  You'll definitely get your money's worth with the portions you get. I have leftovers every time. So instead of considering corporate L&L's, try this place out instead; you'll be pleased that you did.",

A popular spot with Yelp peeps, I was pleased to see that they offer breakfast all day.  I had the eggs, Portuguese sausage, and rice for the bargain price of $5.50--deal!  The sausage had a nice little kick to it, but I only got 4 pieces and about 3 cups of rice--for reals.  I think there should be some equity in proportion, but it's so cheap, I guess I can't really complain.  I really can't complain because I didn't even pay--thanks, BP!  Friendly service and a good selection of Aloha eats--mahalo!",

The macaroni salad was so salty that I couldn't stand more than one bite, but it tasted more like salt water than just overly salted food. The spicy Korean chicken was the only part of the meal that was ok. If I had only ordered that it wouldn't have been so bad.  On the plus side, you get a good amount of food for the price.",

Ok:  In True Aloha Spirit, they can be a little slow on the move but if you have those expectations coming in, you won't mind getting stuck in the line during the lunch rush--they'd be well served having another employee to help during lunch but I'm not paying the bills (well, I guess I kinda am in a round about way, but whatever).   Everything I've had here has been amazing. the small saimin is anything but small. The won tons are great and the sesame oil they use really comes thru in the flavor. The added veggies (bean sprouts/napa cabbage) really are a must. The char sui pork is perfectly sweet and porky. I personally skip the fish cakes b/c that shit ain't for the haoles, man. Just make sure to get a side of hot mustard and dump it into your broth.    I've had most of the different mixed plates and everything i've had has been tasty. even that red-ass hot dog they serve on some plates (redondo hot dogs, i believe).   I think these guys must be laundering money for a rice company b/c they give you about 3x more rice than seems normal. I may die from diabetes in a few years from all the white rice, but hotdamn it'll be worth it.   The only issue I have is that sometimes they run out of things and the menu is limited during dinner. So-fucking-what, though. Just order something you haven't had before, ya jerk.   It's easily in my top 3 Hawaiian restaurants (and I love Hawaiian food) in town. Wish I lived closer because I'd go there all the time.",

The Meat Jun seems to always be the thing to order, although today will be my last time at this local spot. The meat didn't even seem like it was marinated, and it also seemed like it was barely dipped in egg before being fried! No flavor at all, & after 4 bites my jaw was literally tired of chewing \"rubber\". I also ordered a side of the Spicy Korean Chicken--the flavors also weren't all that there & tasted basic as if I was grabbing a meal at Panda Express. The lady up front that took my order was \"Ms. Aloha\", & I didn't have enough guts give my meal back to her, so here I am writing a review about the most unsatisfying meal that I've had in a while. The commute to this restaurant is definitely not worth it anymore.",

I always try to get something different each time I come here. Korean chicken, chicken katsu, portagee sausage eggs n rice, corned beef hash, etc.   I think they only had the corned beef hash during st. Patricks day... If they don't have it on the regular menu, I wish they would add it on. That was Ono! I liked the way they made it here. And I'm all about supporting local Hawaiian businesses. the service is great, quick, and good food.   This is a popular spot for the Hawaiian transplants that live in the Henderson area. Seems to be getting popular among the local las vegas peeps too. Right on!   Bettah than Aloha Kitchen, all the way!  Same owners as Aloha Specialties at the California hotel downtown.",

A lot of my friends talked about how amazing it was but I have been very skeptical of the crap Hawaiian places that seems to be popping up everywhere. Thankfully I was not disappointed.  Located over North Green Valley, Ross J's serves up huge portions of real Hawaiian food. The menu is pretty expansive, they have all the traditional stuff you would find at any Hawaiian restaurants - katsu, saimen, corn beef hash, and the like. But they a couple of their own original stuff: Korean bowls, hamburger steak and the like which are great. Also the prices are very reasonable.  Every dish is a massive amount of food. I don't know how I finish each time but its so damn good. Suggestions: try getting the chicken with out the skin. The skin is a little fatty and actually tastes better with out it. Sub in fried rice for regular rice. The spam fried rice is awesome and goes well with pretty much any dish.  Definitely check this place out if you are looking for some real Hawaiian places.",

It's sort've outrageous actually how big the bowls are.   The BF and I shared a korean spicy chicken bowl - it's not really \"spicy\" but more spice flavored sweet soy sauce in that it reminds me of korean food without the heat. It's still pretty good, but this time it wasn't as crunchy on the skin which can make it rather fatty. I don't know how big a actual plate would be if this was a bowl sized.   Pork katsu menehune plate - menehune is their mini sized plates that has mostly rice, and a tiny scoop (like half what a scoop normally would be). The katsu was crisp and wasn't dried out which seems to happen a lot of pork chop katsus.   Lumpia shanghai - their was 6 in a order and these were thin and long and not filled with too much. Still, even though I would have liked more filling, the pork, carrot and cabbage filling was decent.   We also got a side of macaroni since the menehune didn't have too much and the BF loves macaroni. It was a heaping scoop side.   There was one lady at the counter running the show. Poor auntie had a constant line of people, and had to clear plates and serve so it took a bit for service, but nothing we can fault her on at all. She was doing everything.   Overall, still probably the best plate lunch Hawaiian food around in flavor and in price. It's no surprise there's this many people flowing in.",

This was the first time I ever tried their food but I had no doubt that it would be good because of previous reviews and recommendations from friends.   We ordered the chicken teriyaki, chicken katsu, beef teriyaki and the fried rice. The service was very welcoming when I arrived to pick up the orders and the inside of their business seemed very homey. The portions that were given were very generous and for a very reasonable price.  I would rate this establishment over L&L and although I think L&L is good I just think Ross Js is just as good and for a better price.  The only minor con that I noticed but is not enough to knock a star off is the Katsu sauce. Now I know most Hawaiians have ketchup with their food and it goes for Katsu chicken too but at L&L they have a sweet thick gravy type sauce that comes with their Katsu chicken that I prefer over the ketchup.",

You order at the counter and the food is brought to you at your table. Glass bowls and plates with silverware, no Styrofoam or plastic, except the cups. I odered the spicy Korean chicken bowl with a side order of lumpia. The portions were generous and it was all delicious. Add a Hawaiian Sun pineapple orange soda and the tab, with tax, was $9. If they ditched the Styrofoam in favor of a more environmentally friendly solution and updated the interior of the place, this would be an easy 5 stars. RECOMMENDED",

Got the mixed plate (teriyaki steak, teriyaki chicken & mahi-mahi, rice and macaroni salad) as well as trying spam masubi for the first time. Portion was very filling, wasn't sure I would have been able to finish. The beef and chicken were tender. I am not a fan of fish, but the mahi-mahi was good. The Spam masubi was also tasty, especially since I have tried and did not like nori snacks by themselves nor a big fan of canned meats. This place is pretty affordable too. All in all the mixed plate,  spam masubi and 2 bottles of water was only about $14 after tax. I walked almost 3 miles to try this place out & I'll definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "Honestly disappointed. Ordered the mixed plate and chicken teriyaki plate, and almost everything was flavorless. The fried chicken seems to be dredged in flour only (no seasoning). The taste of the Mahi was defined entirely by the tartar sauce they put on top. The portion of Macaroni salad was very small and tasted overwhelmingly of salt. Most of the meats (even the spam) had a faint fish flavor that I suspect is from shared oil or an under-cleaned grill. The chicken teriyaki had sauce on it but was completely flavorless. Finished the meal thinking the white rice was probably the best part. Unlikely to return. Want to go to an actual good Hawaiian place? Go to Island Flavor. Or even L and L because this place is that bad.",

The food is always the best, super fresh, perfect portions and fast service. My girlfriend and I stopped in around noon, we walked in and there were a lot of people eating. We looked at the menu and ordered a wonton min, teriyaki chicken bowl, spicy Korean chicken bowl, fried noodles and a broccoli beef entree. They have the best saimin, full of flavor, delicious noodles and a good portion for one person.   They are fast and friendly, always willing to answer any questions you may have as well as serve you up a huge dish of aloha! All these years I've gone whether with friends or family they have never failed with keeping the food the same and delicious.",

I ordered the loco moco with over easy eggs and my boyfriend ordered the RJ's big breakfast (which is from the daily specials). The food came out fast with no wait at all. We found everything to be really good and extremely filling. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. Honestly, I'm not surprised that this place gets packed.

Proteins of different sorts, such as beef, chicken and fish were cooked to perfection. Had a nice char on the chicken and beef, and not overcooked to becoming tough and chewy. The fish had a good fry, enough to have a crunchy taste exterior, and nicely cooked on the inside. Also decided to order spam musubi, and tasted as usual, amazing. The seaweed had a fresh taste to it, knowing that it was just made, not sitting out thank goodness. Which is why I go to this restaurant regularly, for good food at a good price.",

I've been here multiple times and there hasn't been a time where I had a bad meal or bad service. During their lunch time roughly 12-2 they can get really busy and the wait might be a bit longer than normal but it is definitely worth it. I almost always get the spicy chicken bowl with broccoli added on. Their broccoli isn't anything special. It actually isn't even seasoned or anything but that's fine because the chicken is so good it compensates for that. Their chicken is sweet, it's salty, it's tangy, and its got a nice little kick to it. The closest thing I can resemble it to is orange chicken without the breading on the outside and a bit more spice. Their portion sizes are extremely generous as well so be ready to bring your leftovers home!",

It is a great place to get good Hawaiian food at a very affordable price. They also offer Hawaiian Sun canned drinks.  The classic go to is the spicy korean chicken bowl, which costs $4-$5. It is a pretty big portion, but all of their dishes consist big portions and a lot of rice. You can also ask for skinless chicken, which I know because a friend requests it every time. Drizzle some sriracha on there and you got some fire!  This time around, I opted for the corn beef hash with eggs because I wanted some breakfast food. It tasted like how it should have and the egg was over medium as requested.  Great value, big portions, decent quality.",

When it was our turn to pay we asked why we had to wait when we called ahead? She said we \"couldn't cut the line\" wth!? Why did we call ahead if we had to wait in line ?! We had 2 forms of payment (for separate orders) and she got an attitude and said \"are you kidding me, I don't have time for this right now, I don't have time for these games!\" The woman  should not be working for the counter or in any customer service atmospheric she is a complete b*tch.

It's still cheap (if not CHEAPER than Aloha since Aloha recently remodeled last year), and the portions are superb. I enjoy getting the spicy Korean chicken bowl, barely $6 after tax I believe. And my girlfriend always gets the chicken bowl, $5-something. There's a lot of seats, and the service is usually pretty quick. This is always our go to if we're in the area and want something cheap that would fill us up.",

I'm sad that it took us this long to try it we have lived down the street from here for 2 years! We had decided to try a bunch of different things and share it so we got the spicy chicken, the teri combo and teriyaki steak and chicken. All of them were amazing to me I especially loved the teriyaki steak and chicken my kids preferred the teriyaki chicken over everything.  The food is super moist and flavorful and tastes as close to homemade as you can get. We will definitly be back!",

There were 6 people in line while the workers slowly walk around, wiping tables, while no one was accommodating any customers in line to even take their orders. The girl with glasses started counting money, slowly in front of us and when we asked to order, she responded beyond rude that we're going to wait and she still won't take our order until after she does a couple more things. I don't understand at all why they can't accommodate us so we can sit and wait rather than just keep making us wait. The customer used to be amazing, but I guess they just hired slow rude girls who know absolutely no customer service.   It's pretty common sense to take orders and let us wait sitting rather than making a long line of people wait while they walk around killing time.",

Ross J's is a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it because the food is pretty good.  I've gotten their chicken katsu and Ross J's mix plate.  The chicken katsu comes out warm and tender. It's very hard to go wrong with chicken katsu, and Ross J delivers on good chicken katsu.  The mix plate is contains teriyaki chicken, chicken steak, and mahi (fish). The chicken steak in the mix plate is battered and fried, and you may want to hold the teriyaki sauce if you're watching the sodium because it's a big plate. The rice in the mix plate is seasoned with seaweed, which adds a nice texture to the plate.  There's not wait staff so you have to get water yourself, but I'm not complaining since with the big portions, I need to be getting out of my seat every now and then to burn some calories.  I recommend Ross J's for anyone looking for some good, reasonably-priced Hawaiian food. It's worth the drive even if you're 5 miles away.",

When I opened up the plate, it had 2 small pieces of chicken and a whole lot of rice. Like so much rice that I thought it compensated for the small pieces of chicken. And my husband had 3 large pieces of chicken for his chicken long rice. Also the kimchi spilled everywhere on his way home. I wished they wrapped it up with some clear wrap or used a container with a lid. Food is good but I probably won't be coming back for a while.",

Not sure if it was because it didn't have any salt or something, but it was very very bland. The Mac n cheese was unfortunately the same. Thick and had too much mayo. Twice the amount that should have been there.   A plus is that the portions are great for the price, but sometimes that doesn't work in your favor.   Putting a 3 for now and hoping it changes when I come back in the future and try something else.",

Was craving Hawaiian food and decided to eat here based off other reviews. There was also already a line when we came and lots of people eating inside so based off that we initially thought we were going to enjoy some really good hawaiian food. The wait for our takeout order was about 15-20 minutes. We ordered the teriyaki combo plate, Ross j special plate, and a side order of Korean chicken.   - The combination plates were honestly just ok. Kind of lacking some flavor. Portions were good though. - The Korean chicken was really good and would definitely recommended! Lots of good flavors.  - lots and lots of rice is given with the combo plates. More than needed. We had a lot leftover so it was a good thing we had an extra side of chicken ordered.  - the Mac salad.. something about it tasted different and not like all the other Hawaiian places we've been to  In conclusion, portions here are good but flavors are ok. Wait times are also long. Probably will not be back here again and instead go to a different Hawaiian place.",

Now it gets busy, so I recommend ordering your food ahead of time. My usual order is the katsu or katsu curry plate with a musubi or 2 & then some Mac salad on the side. Nothing hits like good ole Hawaiian food. Love this place, can wait to come back for another Hawaiian plate lunch!",

    "text": "After years of visiting, it's time to give some Yelp love...  Ross J Service & Ambiance:  This is a mom and pop kitchen with mom and pop Hawaiian decor.  It's comfortable like a casual resto you'd find in Hawaii.  It's mainly booth seating so you might see single diners taking up full booths when they're full.  The staff is always very friendly and the kitchen gets your food to you shortly after ordering.  The drinks are self serve so the staff can focus on processing orders and getting dishes out quickly.  Ross J grindage:  All the dishes I've had through the years have been prepared well and delish.  These are my faves:  The saimin soup comes loaded with noodles and beef and the broth is savory.  The loco moco gravy really brings the flavor that's paired with the egg, rice and hamburger patty.  My go to is the local plate: 2 Spam musubis with teri chicken for me.  You quantity sizes are massive as I'm either super full or taking food home when I leave Ross J's.  Ross J's is on my safe spaces when it comes to Hawaiian food.  They've never let me down and the grindage is consistently on point. Mahalo!",

Though we have been noticing lately that the cleanliness inside of the restaurant seems to keep dwindling. This last time, the tables were sticky, and the condiments on the table hadn't been cleaned off in quite awhile. Looking on the floor under and between the booths hadn't been cleaned in some time. After seeing this, it made our experience quite disappointing.",

It comes with rice but you can add mixed veggies or mushroom and onion. The chicken is on point, with a lot of flavor. The chicken is cooked to perfection making it soft with a nice crunch from the skin. While you are here, don't forget to try their spam musubi. They know how to make one good tasting spam musubi, you won't regret it. This place can get busy depending what time you go (usually around lunch) but it's definitely worth the wait. I always had great service and all the staffs are friendly.  If you are nearby, be sure to check out this hidden gem.",

Well for me, it was today.   When I arrived to pace my take out order, I walked in and it was packed. I thought to myself this must be a good sign; almost all the dining tables were full. I tried to creep on those sitting and eating to see how big their portions were and to just see what they were eating. From what I saw the portions looked quite large.  I ordered one of \"the specials of the day,\" called the Aloha Bento. This included hellllllla rice, a piece of spicy Korean teriyaki chicken, a couple thin slices of teriyaki beef, 1 redonda hot dog and a small sauce cup filled with cold Mac salad. Seriously, I was excited to try this place but to my disappointment- it's not that great. The meat and rice ratio was just off for me; there was SO much more rice compared to the meat. The chicken was okay, and the beef was slightly rubbery. The Mac salad had a weird sour taste to it, I hope I don't get sick tomorrow. Ugh, yikes!   I'm going to stick to my Island Flavor for any and all Hawaiian food cravings!",

So since i was in the area i decided to grab a quick bite and a musubi for my little one for the ride home.  Stopped in around 330 pm and the place was rather quiet, couple tables occupied, some to go orders as well. The lady and girl working were real friendly and offered plenty of Aloha.  I decided to go with the bento from the specials board and the spam musubi (my littles favorite) the wait time wasn't too bad.  Judging by the menu they have tons of local favorites. Teri beef, hamburger steak, korean chicken, loco moco, spam musubi and the famous mac salad. Prices are moderate and pretty average while the special plates like the Ross J's special are a little pricier close to $9 a plate but well worth the price for the amount of food given.  The bento i ordered had Rice, Mac salad, Teri beef, Korean Chicken and Redondos hot dog. The plate was filling and ono. The teri beef was super duper delish and definitely will be having just that next time. The mac salad was tasty but little bit too much mayo for my liking. But i can get pass that.  Overall Ross J's has a lot of parking available, plate lunches have great portions for great prices and everything taste ono!!!! We will definitely be back even though we live a little further away for the ono grinds. Mahalo Ross J's!",

It's simple food - what you would likely find in most Hawaiian drive-inns. But the food does not lack flavor in any type of way.  The loco moco was delicious. One of the best I've had in Vegas so far. Featuring a decent sized hamburger patty, 2 eggs, brown gravy, and TONS of rice. I ordered extra gravy, of course. For the price, you can't go wrong. Although I do wish it came with a scoop of mac salad; even if that meant less rice. That would have put this plate over the top.  The spam musubi was yummy as well. Finally a place with a decent slice of spam and a good rice ratio. I'm tired of all the other places that gives you a sliver of spam, too much rice, and mounds of teriyaki sauce. Nope, not at Ross J's. They got it right here.  For the local Hawaiian's like me who grew up going to Byron's drive-inn for a cup of green river. GO TO ROSS J's NOW! Also known as lime punch, it was a very satisfying flash back to my childhood.  Ross J's is simple, satisfying local Hawaiian food and exactly what I needed during a Vegas excessive heat warning.",

Honestly, it doesn't matter if it's a good or a bad day, just come here and I think you'll leave in better spirits and feeling stuffed in the best way.  I got a spicy chicken bowl a couple of days ago and when the server put it down, I was surprised at how massive it was! They also have different musubis; there is a chicken musubi, spam musubi, and Portuguese sausage musubi. YUM!  What keeps me coming back...I love the price, the taste, the area and the staff.

The hamburger meat they use does not taste like the lunches they serve at elementary schools and the gravy is perfect to compliment the meat and not overpower it. The eggs and rice... they taste like eggs and rice... if you mess those up... gg. Anyhow, the only drawback is the wait can be long at times.

    "text": "Came here yesterday cuz I was craving some local food. Born and raised in Hawaii, i know what real local food is so i would say this review is pretty credible. Was craving korean chicken like the kind from ZIppys but this one turned out to be grilled and chicken strips. Not fried in chunks. Put the sauce on the side and added veggies to the bowl cuz i heard the portions were pretty big. Also had the fruit punch which was as close as you can get I think to hawaiian style fruit punch, i think Island Flavor has better fruit punch though, had to add water cuz it was a lil too sweet. Only tried this one dish but have to say it was really good and you get a whole plates worth of food for just ordering a bowl. Sauce wasnt that spicy, thank goodness and it was actually really flavorful. I'd definitely come back here again but only if Island Flavor is closed.",

I usually always opt for the Mahi plate and a fountain drink (although every so often I like to dip into their reserve of Hawaiian Sun guava juice).  The breading on the Mahi is soft and flaky and not the overly fried versions I find at L&L or Aloha Kitchen.  The plate also comes with a side of mac salad, and although it's nothing like grandma's mac salad or even Zippy's mac salad, it's pretty 'ono (delicious) to say the least.  The staff here is always friendly and inviting, regardless of how packed it is, and always willing to accommodate a special order (I like the korean style chicken sauce on my Mahi so I get it on the side to dip my fish).  All in all, Ross J's is a pretty good time and they always keep the super grubbin' eats comin.",

So why the1 star?  My family lives in N Las Vegas and my daughter had a volleyball game in Henderson at 6:30. We told the kids we would wait till after the game to eat so we could eat at Ross J's. They were excited because they loved their food.  Well...we got there at 15 minutes to 8 and were immediately told that they were out of chicken and that they close at 8pm. So...basically you're not dining in here was the message we got.  So my husband lets them know we're not from this side of town so we wouldn't have a place to eat. And a blank stare... C'MON! Where's the Aloha Spirit? At 808 Mixed Plate on Craig Road in N Las Vegas, they sit and talk story with you and they tell you to take your time eating while they clean up around you. They get it, and their food is great!  We're standing there with 4 hungry kids and 4 adults (grandma and grandpa came to watch their granddaughter play). Grandpa walks in with a cane because he just got knee surgery.....and we got turned away. WOW...business must really be good for them.   I don't know about you, but in this economy I would rather be giving my hard earned dollar to businesses who need it and obviously they didn't need our business. Turning away 8 people... Really?  You can give them your money, but I'll be helping out businesses like 808 who need it. BTW 808 has a killer haupia cake that melts in your mouth. They are always asking what kind of Hawaiian foods and desserts that you miss so they can update their menu. That's great customer service and that's the Aloha Spirit.",

Couple of times long wait when no customers in, one time brought DH order but not mine, after waiting a few minutes asked lady where it was - oops we forgot to order it.  Tonight was the last straw: Husband got here ahead of me and ordered for us.  2 large phone in orders ahead of us but  I can live with that.  Brought DH order said he would be right back with mine.  5 minutes later go to counter - lady tells man I am waiting for my order.  10 minutes  finally my food comes out.  I explain it is rude to serve 2 people who order and came together 10 minutes apart.  Man gets angry with me and says \"can't you see how busy we are, sure I say but food should come out together.  He says \"what ,should I have let his food get cold, can't you see your not the only one waiting?\" No sir that's not the problem. The food should have been cooked and served at the same time.  Complete 1 order at a time - restaurants all over the world deliver the whole tables order together.  We came to eat a meal together not a separate times.  Get organized don't try to do too many orders at once and most certainly, DON'T GET MAD AT THE CUSTOMER FOR YOUR MISTAKE.  Good restaurants would at least apologize and try to make it better not worse. Your food quality has gone down and you really don't care about the customer.  It makes me sad because I remember when this was a great and friendly place, but I won't be going back and will tell everybody I can not to go either.",

Fried noodles means fried noodles, I have never had fried noodles wet and soupy like. So, I call the restaurant to talk to them about the my meal. The girl who answered the phone was very rude, then she told me I had to talk to the owners daughter in law. She put's  me on hold for 24mins, then when the daughter in law gets on the phone,  that didn't go well either. As I was trying to explain to her about my meal, she tell's me I have to specifically specify how I would like my noodles due different cooks, prepping the meal differently.I then get disconnected, How am I suppose to know who's cooking and when to ask, I asked myself. So, then I call back I ask the person who answered the phone if I could get her name she stated \"NO\" she just needs my name & number if I would like to get a call back. I give her my number and I ask her if I could get the owners daughter in law's name, she say's \"NO\". Then I tell her she's rude then, she say's her name is Penny. I was put on hold again for another 18min just for her to tell me someone would call me back. I will never go back to this place ever again. My co-worker and the rest of my work crew will never go back to this place as they have witness what I just went thru. Sad so sad. The funny thing is, you go in they are all smiley and friendly, but when you call you get a whole different type of attitude. Like really I'm sorry that's not how we show aloha and the girl who answered is local. Everyone who knows Hawaiians we are very aloha spirited. There was no aloha spirit today. Those smiley faces today was phony it's all for the job and to sucker in consumers.",

    "text": "We dined in for lunch one day, the floor had been mopped with a dirty/sour mophead, you can smell the funky odor on the floor. Teri beef is fatty/greasy and tough. Mahi Mahi is just chunks of cooked fish. Huge slathering of stucky white rice and overly mayoed mac salad with no flavor. My chicken katsu came with what I still think is ketchup and no katsu sauce. I asked for katsu sauce and the boss lady says that is katsu. No it's Ketchup, not tonkatsu sauce like everyone knows. So I asked for a side of teri sauce instead. My chicken katsu is Deeeep fried extra hard and the chicken had tough skin underneath. Too crunchy and taste like low grade chicken, greasy. Overly mayoed mac salad and a huge wave of white rice that wasn't all that fresh. Is this good food? I guess some think so and they are welcome to it. I like a certain place on 215 and Green Valley or 215 and Eastern much better.",

Great flavor with just a bite of heat, goes great with the rice and macaroni salad to cool things off. I got an order of the Lumpia, they were not as fantastic as I had hoped, but it's okay. It was a cheap lunch (about $8) and I still have some for later! Staff was nice, I took it to go but the restaurant looked clean and busy! I'll go again, so much on the menu to try, not sure what will be next!",

I still love the flavor of their plate, but the meals are starting to look more like a huge pile of Rice, with only  two small pieces of meat (and this is for a two choice combo).   Not to mention, the  mac salad was pretty salty on my last visit.   I'm not sure what this restaurant is doing lately, but stop being manju or you won't see me coming back.  I'll give Ross J's another try, because this was one of my favorites Hawaiian eatery in Vegas, but lately, the amount of meats is very shocking small.",

This definitely brings me back home to Hawaii but I recently tried out their roast pork and its absolutely not what I had expected. I was very disappointed when I opened my plate because back home in Hawaii many people know roast pork as the crispy fried pork bites with crispy skin and usually eaten with hot mustard and soy sauce. But this roast pork looked and tasted as if it was boiled and then slathered with gravy. It tasted like a TV dinner and wasn't appetizing at all. I love Ross j's and everything else that I have tried but one star off because of the horrible roast pork.  It was not a pleasant lunch.",

First they didn't have what I wanted to order because they ran out?!?! The line maybe had 4 separate families and it took a half an hour just standing there waiting to order. The girls behind the counter was more interested in having a conversation then serving the people in front of them to cut down on the wait time. The food was horrible or maybe just the wrong cook for the day. My pork cutlet was burnt and barely had gravy. The Mac salad was salty to where I couldn't even eat it and I love salt. They brought the wrong food to the table and acted like we were wrong. Management needs to step in and straighten out these workers or this will be another Hawaiian restaurant that closes down. Where is the \"Aloha Spirit\"??? Oh and the tables were super dirty and the floor was sticky everywhere. As a Hawaiian u know we always support our own but man this place was horrible.",

I thought it was good, so one day I decided to go in there myself. I strongly believe that I would've given it a 5 if I hadn't seen the inside.  If you are a person like myself that goes off what the tables and inside looks like, clean wise, then please don't go inside ever.  I believe they should take a day or two to really clean the place up. It's not even about how old the tables and chairs look but on how dirty it looks in there. My husband thinks I'm just too picky but trust me , you will enjoy your food more if you just order it and have someone get it for you. I still eat their food once in a while but the experience always gets ruined when the chicken isn't consistent on the crunchiness and flavor and then I remember how the establishment looks like inside.  So, just because I like it once in a while I'll give it a 3 because my husband and kids do like it no matter what.",

Their katsu is very crispy and meaty. The boyfriend ordered the cutlet plate and thought it was going to be crispy katsu, but it was actually katsu curry hahah. No big deal thoughhhh cuz we ended up sharing our plates and I actually liked the curry over the katsu so I ate the majority of his and he ate mine. The mac salad was too salty though. I wish Yelp would let you do half stars, because 4.5 is what I would give this place. Mac salad are one of the reasons I l eat Hawaiian bbQ and this is the only place that it's disappointed me on that but nonetheless I love their katsu. They give you ALOT of rice too. Not sure if it's the same amount if you to go it but the plate they give when you dine in is HUGE. You will definitely get your money's worth if you're a big eater.",

    "text": "I have never had such an awful customer experience like I did today. First: I ordered my lunch and paid for it. The woman at the register who I believe is married to the owner (wears a flower in her hair everyday) asks \"is this order for here or to go?\" I reply to \"To go!\" (because every time I eat here I always have to ask for a box to take out) Once my food is ready, I find an open table and begin enjoying my lunch. Soon after, a line is starting to form for the lunch rush and the woman behind the register passes my table while delivering an order to a nearby table. Much to my embarrassment, she stops at my table and says out loud enough to gain the attention of most of the surrounding tables which were full, \"Sir, I am going to have to ask you to leave. You have a to go order and to go orders MUST leave. I was in shock and asked her to re-think again what she was saying and further explained that I am a paying customer and I have to leave because I ordered my meal to go. She replied \"YES!!!!\" I again gave her a chance to rethink her logic and asked, \"So if I had ordered it for here, I could stay and you would have delivered the food to my table on a plate (which would now be dirty and requires cleaning?\" She replied with \"Sir I don't need customers fighting over tables, as you can see we are very busy and your order was to go so please leave. \" I asked her if I could get her to explain it one more time while I get video of her explaining this nonsense and she then retracted to say, \"OK If I have a customer who wants to sit here you may have to get up and go but you can stay for now.\" As I look around the restaurant for reactions I am met with turning heads in embarrassment and a couple of shaking heads (in shame) from some teenagers at a table close by. I am convinced she is having a bad day but this really makes me shake my head in disbelief. What would you do? I'd lover to know what others think about this woman's (business owners) decision.",

I have been in Vegas for over two years now, visited this place at least over 2 dozen times but have nothing bad to say about it.    I love love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki rice bowl..its under four bucks, you get a good amount of rice and chicken.  The sauce is different then your normal Teriyaki sauce at other places. I've asked for extra sauce so many time, pretty much with every order...They give without charging an extra penny.   I've recently tried their normal teri chicken rice bowl, also the same price but the sauce is less salty.  Feel in love all over again.  I don't know how this place stays in business charging as they do, but I think because its family own, quite affordable that the locals always comes back for more, keeping this awesome hole in the wall in business.    Their spam masubi is 1.50, spam is decent in size and enough for a good filling snack.  :)   I think what put it over the top for me was last night.  I order my usual, the chicken teri bowl on the phone,  but when i came to pick it up, their person who took my order thought i order the actually plate which was two times the price, I make it known to Matt, and he, without hesitation, gave me my food charging me for the rice bowl and extra side of chicken.  (I also tipped a few bucks for the nice service)  When i opened it, the size of my order was not the bowl but the plate.  I was amazed at the customer service this place continuous to reflect.  I called Matt to say thanks once again.    No reason to not try this place if you haven't been in before, its worth the time, the drive and the room you have in your belly! :)",

You can order extra portions or extra meat and it'll still be cheaper than most places you go to. It's fast and tastes amazing. I would usually just order a teriyaki chicken/beef bowl with extra meat. That was plenty. I tasted a few other items on the menu and was never disappointed.   I've lived out here for years and found this place a year ago. Couldn't stop going after that. The Vegas area has a TON of great places to eat, arguably more than nearly any other place you might visit and this is one of the restaurants I'm gonna miss most when I move. I can tell you it has a solid following. I don't see ads anywhere or any word of mouth but I have a story.   A few months ago there was some insane construction going on in that plaza. The construction had to tear up the only parking lot with access to this place. So anyone who wanted to eat here had to park a bit down the street and walk a ways to get there. That didn't really phase me much but that will deter a lot of people, especially people who don't go there often so I expected it to be empty... When I went inside that place was packed with a big line. Apparently ease of access wasn't a concern for the people who know how good this place is. They definitely have a large amount of \"regulars\" for a reason.",

I got the the garlic chicken with gravy plate one time and the portions were ridiculously big!  3 big pieces of chicken w/ gravy over a mountain of rice with a side of Mac salad. This is truly food for my Samoan homies and for those who can really eat.  Everything is priced cheaper than it should be, in my opinion.  But I hope they don't change the prices on anything.

They give you way more rice than is consumable, but that's ok.  The food is fresh and delicious and the prices are very good, especially for the bowls.  They often have a corned beef hash with eggs (on rice) special that is also really yummy.  On Fridays, you can get an order of ahi poke.  If you come for lunch, get there before noon... or expect to stand in line to order and you may not get a place to sit!",

It was a good portion, lots of flavor, and chicken wasn't dry.   The beau got the Ross J Special Pack. This was such a big portion that it honestly can be shared by two. It had everything.. Chicken, Kalbi, fish, rice and Mac salad. I didn't really try anything on that plate besides the Mac Salad, which I thought was on the salty side. I attempted to try a bite a few more times after that but it was just way too salty. I felt my blood pressure rise from all the sodium.   The people that work there were pretty nice and attentive. The place is pretty clean. The portions were great. Even the \"Half Order\" of Katsu Chicken looked like a full order! I probably won't be returning all that soon but none the less a good place to go when you're on that side of town with a Hawaiian craving.",

Ross J's has never let me down and for me, this is my comfort food, my little secret of a Hawaiian restaurant doing it right.

I was in heaven back in '01 when they opened their 2nd place here in Green Valley. Aloha Specialties at the Cal is their first restaurant. Since then Ross J's has gone through one move but it is still the same family and still the same ono (good) eats!    2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop mac (macaroni)salad, and choice of meat and you have your traditional Hawaiian \"Plate Lunch!\" That's what I wanted today. I got the \"Hawaiian Plate\" which came with Kalua Pig and Lau Lau. The price is right too!   Loooove the Kalua Pig and Lau Lau. Both are moist with a lot of flavor and portion wise, fine enough for me...but DANG THE RICE..it was more like 2 shovels than 2 scoops of rice! I hardly eat rice as it is so there was plenty left that got wasted.  Now I remember why I hardly am here anymore.  Not trying to come off as a health nut, but dietary wise too much starches, not enough veggies.  Ahh no worries I'll just shake it off in Hot Hula Fitness classes at the gym.   Ross J crew always full of Aloha. They still remember us and come out to say hi. Atmosphere here is pretty laid back. I can show up sans no makeup, crazy hair wearing slippahs in the winter and no one gives me stink eye.   The place is clean, it's been through couple changes throughout the years. Gone is the awesome mural they had at the original location.  The booths in dining area had blue seating with the surf scene on it. It's now red  hibiscus flowers.  But for going on fifteen years here in Henderson this place still gots the island flavor!",

It would have gone faster if the staff would crank out the line instead of talking story with each other and moving slow as Honus. They were very friendly though I must say. Once the food came out it was a complete disappointment..the Mac salad was super salty to were it's inedible, the cutlet we got was over cooked and burnt breading. The major problem was the cleanliness I mean tables were clear and stuff but I mean detail cleanliness. The booths are dirty and torn,the blinds are all streaky and smeared looking,the walls and air vents are all filthy and condiment baskets on tables need a good scrubbing. I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like if they let their dining area get this bad and don't maintain it with detail cleaning. Over all won't come back.",

I originally wanted the original Loco Moco but my husband accidentally ordered me the Spam Loco Moco. It was a good and filling lunch but the spam made it a little salty. I don't love spam so I wasn't thrilled with the dish. There was nothing that wow-ed me with the dish, even if it was spam-less. Supposedly this is classic Hawaiian food.   My sister and brother in law both got chicken teriyaki - just chicken over rice, nothing special.   I do recommend getting the guava nectar if you're looking for something sweet and flavorful to drink. I would order it over ice.",

I've eaten here a few times already and I really enjoy this place.   The 2 older ladies working the counter (their names slip my mind) are so sweet and welcoming. Very True to the Hawaiian lifestyle. There is a huge menu to choose from, so make sure you aren't in the way of other people who know what they want already. Food comes out quickly with a friendly smile. And while you are enjoying your food, they check on you to see if you're doing ok.   I always order the same thing; Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice with a side of kimchee. The portions aren't on the enormous side but are enough to get you full. I'm sure the other items are just as delicious. Well this just gives me a reason to keep coming back.",

    "text": "Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue is where the ninth island meets the sunset and mountain Vista. Las Vegas is referred to as the ninth island. The Las Vegas valley is interspersed with outstanding restaurants serving Hawaiin barbecue. At the northwest corner of Sunset Road and Mountain Vista Boulevard in the Smith's - Galaxy Theater anchored shopping center, Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue has built a reputation for their plate lunch Hawaiin barbecue dishes.      A plate lunch consists of two scoops of rice (usually white), macaroni salad, and an entree. The plate lunch tradition dates back to the 1800s when the Plantation workers sustained on leftover rice with food such as canned meat, teriyaki, and cold meat. In 1999, L&L made the plate lunch popular on the mainland. In 2015, I developed a taste for the plate lunch thanks to L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. It is this taste for Hawaiian barbecue that has led me into Ross J's a few times recently.       Everytime that I stepped inside, it has been abuzz with people. Ross J's obviously has a good name in the valley.       In contrast to L&L and Island Flavor, the Ross J's system is different. Here you order the food and pay. From the point that you pick up your beverage cup, you seat yourself and they deliver the food to your table. Plus they will bus your table. The delicious food that they deliver to your table is presented on a plate instead of a styraphon box. Every table features condiments that include chili sauce, soy sauce, Sriracha sauce, salt, and pepper.       The restaurant itself is nothing beautiful. The shopping center could use a remodel. The restaurant interior with its sufficient seating is ordinary. Many times in life it's not the beauty on the outside that counts but the beauty on the inside that counts. The beautiful taste of the abundant portions of good food is what counts with me.       On my first visit, I enjoyed the mixed plate. In plate lunch terminology a mixed plate is a plate lunch with more than one entree. This mixed plate featured teriyaki steak, chicken, Machi, lots of white rice, and macaroni salad. I enjoyed it so much that I'd return to Ross J's a second time. This time I experienced the mochiko chicken plate lunch. Six pieces of chicken occupied a good portion of the plate, white rice nearly half, and macaroni salad a quarter of it. Following this visit, some of my Yelp friends boasted about how great the Spicy Korean chicken was. In Yelp friends I trust, and made a third visit for the spicy Korean chicken. These Yelp friends were right on the mark because the spicy chicken with some Sriracha sauce over it was my favorite.       Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue lives up to its name. I see myself returning, especially since I frequently shop at Smith's. The next time I will most likely take out a plate lunch to enjoy across the street in the Ethal M Cactus Gardens. Before I return I give Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue my stamp of approval with this four star rating.",

For the past couple of years it's been home to Ross J's. If I had my way, I would come here everyday but alas, we reside in the other side of the valley now.  We wanted Hawaiian food when we woke up Saturday morning and was debating on either going to their California Hotel location or Henderson, the latter was decided on as we remembered the HI vs UNLV game was this weekend and most likely downtown would be insanely busy. I like coming here better anyway, it's more laidback.   Hubby opted for the breakfast fare: Hawaiian fried rice, eggs and Portuguese sausage. I was jonesing for a fix of their Spicy Korean chicken, man was it good! With just the right amount of heat for my liking, so flavorful and moist and the crispy skin just puts it over the top. They have the best Spicy Korean chicken in town imho! Kids shared a Chicken Katsu plate as their portions are so large. Everything was on point! Prices are very affordable, would definitely be willing to pay a couple dollars more for the quality and portions we get. Weekends can get pretty busy and there might be a little wait here and there but believe me, it's WORTH it! Don't forget to grab a bag of their delicious cookies by the register for dessert $5 a bag ;)",

In Henderson, it's #1.  I love the vibe here, so laid back and the workers are always nice and accommodating. There are plenty of items on the menu including all the classic Hawaiian favorites like teriyaki bowls, loco mocos, kalua pig, and saimin. I never seem to have a chance to really try anything else because I always want the spicy Korean chicken!  We have used them for catering years ago.

    "text": "I came here after an awesome morning hiking Mount Charleston. I heard that they had the best Loco Moco in Las Vegas and so I added thirty minutes to my commute home by driving across town to test this claim. I was going to dine in, but then I saw it. Spam Musubi. I love spam musubi. I really really want to give Ross J's five stars for their spam musubi alone, but I wasn't as thrilled with my entire meal experience. Let me explain.   I was so overwhelmed by the menu and also starving that I decided to order several entrees and two spam musubis, just for me. I ordered the Loco Moco for myself and decided to fib to the super friendly girl taking my order and say that I had a friend who wanted me to surprise \"him\" with a meal. Why I decided to fib is beyond me and why I selected to label said imaginary friend male is also beyond me. I have no shame in eating two meals. None. But in that moment, I shamed myself. Brene Brown would have been very disappointed in me.  I added the Ross J special to my order and an extra side of Mac Salad. They were super proactive and offered to poke holes in the to-go boxes as not to let them get all steamy. I ate one spam musubi on my way home. The spam was browned and crisped to perfection. The rice was warm and tender. The seaweed easy to bite through. Heaven. I nibbled on the white fish that was part of the Ross J combo. It was a little eggy and tough in some bites. The flavor was good and the tarter sauce was packed with citrus. The combo also had the most magically crispy exterior. The chicken was juicy. Yum. What lost me through was the beef. It was chewy and hard to eat.   I dove into the loco moco when I got home. The beef patty was a bit overcooked, and since they pack the rice mile high, it really needed extra gravy. *note for next time* I'm going to blame the 25 minute commute back home on the overcooked patty, so I want to try it again to be sure. The mac salad was a bit too heavy on the mayo for my liking and not my favorite thing I ate there either.  I'm so in love with that Spam Musubi though. I think when I get married someday, I'm totally going to have them make me a spam musubi \"cake\".  Even weeks later, I'm still full from this experience. All for less than $30. That's a win.",

Lots of rice unfortunately, not enough sauce. Place could use a bit of a cleanup slash remodel, feels a little dusty and dinerish. Friendly service. Overall, not bad, not great. 3.5/5",

Lots of hawaii style local food, katsu, loco moco, span, meat jun, korean spicy chicken, saimen, musubi, teri bowls, etc.  If you are a big eater and want lots of ono island-style food for good price, RJ's is the place. I am getting too old for this so I gotta stick with a bowl with extra veggies or a bowl of saimen.  The combos are too much.    Service is quick and friendly.  This is old school place.  It's the kind of place you find in Honolulu even though it is Henderson, NV.",

I went to lunch today with my buddy and ordered hamburger patty Loco moco and one to go for my husband. I can't consume large quantities of food at one time so I decided to get a to go container for mine. My husband's food was in a plastic bag and mines was sitting under his. When I left, I only grabbed the bag leaving my food by accident. Now, I can deal with them just say there was nothing they could do to replace it, but to go as far as saying \"if you want us to get it out of the trash for you we will!\" I found that statement insulting and disrespectful. My thoughts are,  if you talk to people that way that spend their hard earned money at your establishment really says a lot about how you feel about your customers. I will never eat here again. I never was disrespectful to them, all I asked is \"was there anyway they could replace it or maybe discount it, or I'll pay for a smaller portion. Mind you they said they kept it 20 minutes. I don't even live 20 minutes away.",

While the chicken is yummy it doesn't make me think of Korean flavors at all but that didn't bother me it was the amount of salt used on the chicken. I didn't get rice so that probably made it worse.    Their Mac salad is divine and they fry the spam for their musubi which many places don't do. I would come back just for those two.",

INSANE.  Second, big, big selection.  They really do have something for everyone.  And, and, they have my beloved Lau Lau on Fridays (Hawaiian plate, what what).

After sampling many different things on the menu over the years, my absolute favorite is the Spicy Korean Chicken, chopped up and extra crispy.  The plate comes with rice and mac salad.  Another favorite that is reserved for the winter time is the wonton soup. The wonton's are homemade and simply amazing.  On Friday's they serve Poke which again is simply amazing!  Aloha!",

    "text": "I've been back a few times since my first try, and I've gotta say that I must've found the one thing on the menu that's not good for some reason. I think I've had the spam loco moco, the less expensive teriyaki pork dish, and the spicy Korean chicken bowl since then. The latter is probably the best option, and it's truly not that spicy. I remember really enjoying the small side of macaroni salad that came with the teriyaki pork. There's actually no need to get the $7+ stuff unless you're really hungry or splitting a dish with someone! So yeah, come here and skip the portuguese sausage moco loco, imo, and you'll have a great meal.",

    "text": "I remember going to Ross J's years ago prior to its relocation and it was extremely tasty from what I had remembered.  I recently went here for brunch and was just truly disappointed:  Ordered:   Garlic Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken Bowl with Mushrooms and Veggies  Pros:  * Huge portions.  So large you can even share  *  Very friendly service  *  Decently priced  Cons:   * Both the Garlic Chicken and Teri Bowl were very bland (and I mean VERY bland)   * Slow service.  It was very busy and the cashier was also the same person delivering the food to the tables  Overall:   I hate giving low scores.  This place was real busy and seems to be a local fav, but I was just disappointed with my order.  The service, price, and portions were all a plus but the food itself was a thumbs down for me.",

    "text": "I love this place. When you think of a Hawaiian BBQ kind of place, I'm sure L&L might come into mind at first, but once you try Ross J's, your Hawaiian food referral is switched.   Starting off with their service, the staff is friendly and gives off their local Hawaiian feel. (I'm from HI myself) I love the locals service. They're all very welcoming and patient, especially when their lines are longer. However, I feel they're somewhat under-staffed during certain shifts.   I've eaten here about 4 times and I cannot get enough of the garlic chicken with gravy... What I love is that the gravy isn't too salty, so the flavor of the chicken is what you're tasting with the compliment of gravy. I did try their loco moco, just because my boyfriend ordered the garlic chicken already. Their pork patty to eggs to rice ratio is right on the dot.   The seating is limited depending on the hour of your visit.  If you're dining in, they serve your entree on large plates. Overall, all visits were worth the drive and money. Youre leaving with a happy stomach :)",

Large menu selection with local favorites and served with Aloha by actual Hawaii guys. We were warmly greeted walking in and also when leaving with our delicious assortment of musubi, lumpia, and plate lunches. Food was really good, rice and meats cooked to perfection, no dry rice here. My only regret is that we found this place on our last day in Vegas, at least we have spam and Portuguese sausage musubi for our long drive to Oregon :)",
