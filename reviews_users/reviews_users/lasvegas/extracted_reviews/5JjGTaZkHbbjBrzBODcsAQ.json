The portions are just right, they even let you do half rolls which most sushi restaurants won't.   I recommend Wild fire sushi roll and starfish sushi roll on their chefs special. Also try the shrimp balls as appetizer it was so good.  Fresh oysters was so delicious I wish it didn't have limit on how many you can order .  The only down part is the service. It took a really long time to get our orders in otherwise I would had given this place 5 stars.",

Was really glad they were part of the all-you-can eat menu. The fish they used for the nigiri was actually not that fresh.. especially the tuna.. it looked, funny. The size of the nigiri is also quite small compared to the other places around the valley but it didn't really bother me since I take small bites anyways. Service was excellent. The only problem was when we ordered the salmon collar. It was actually undercooked but they immediately replaced it with a new one so good service on that part. I probably wouldn't come back for all-you-can eat but it is definitely a place to take non-sushi lovers + sushi lovers since they have a larger variety of non-fish appetizers.  Appetizers to get:   -Miso black cod -Salmon collar - Yellowtail collar - Yakitori - Fresh oysters",

    "text": "Definitely a solid 4 stars for Daisho Sushi!!!  We usually don't venture out to this side of town but after seeing so many delicious pictures posted by @aznttboy on my Instagram feed, we had to come check it out!  Came on a Saturday morning so we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves.. Nice clean & open space. They are located in the same plaza as Walmart-neighborhood.   My boyfriend went with the lunch AYCE while I paid a couple bucks extra and went with the dinner price.. I wanted to sample all the special 1per person/dinner only items.. -Oysters / were good! -Yellowtail Poki / came on a bed of seaweed salad and was very good! You can also get tuna or salmon poki.. -Miso Cod / buttery and sweet! watch out for the bones though! -Yakitori Skewers / we got bacon wrapped asparagus, enoki mushrooms, quail eggs & the tuna... These things are huge.. 2 sticks come in 1 order so don't order too much! Bacon anything is delicious although I would have liked the bacon to be a little bit more crisp. -Nigiri / Everything was decently fresh and we didn't run into anything horrible but the standouts for me were the scallops and fatty albacore! mmmmmM -Wild Fire Roll / (no rice) spicy tuna, tuna, albacore & soy paper.. Loved the presentation!  -Miso Soup / seemed a bit watered down & they don't offer the option to add the shrimp head to it. -Dessert / we had the standard green tea ice cream & yuzu sorbet.. hopefully they add some more creative desserts to the menu!  Service was fast from our server although sometimes it seemed there was a language barrier but he was very efficient. The sushi chef who helped us was nice and kept the conversation going and the food a-flowing.. Forgot his name but he likes to play golf and he is from S. Carolina LOL  HOT TIP: Ask for a stamp card!!!!  Watching what you eat? No problem, they have like 6 non rice rolls + several fish only appetizer items.",

    "text": "*This visit was just THREE days after Tony T.'s and Michael K.'s 5-star experience....  Before meeting up with the gang for some Bingo action at South Point, we decided to get our sushi on here after hearing that they had good nigiri, kick-ass appetizers, and that the head sushi chef was from Blue Ribbon inside the Cosmopolitan. Already with high expectations and an appetite for destruction, we sit up at the bar, go all-in with AYCE.  We start off with both the salmon and tuna poke. The salmon was good, but the texture of the tuna was kinda suspect...gave them the benefit of the doubt, and ordered up some nigiri- Uni, Blue Crab, Fatty Albacore, and Amaebi. \"The Amaebi is not good...too small\" says our sushi chef......OH....KAY??? \"The tuna is good\" he says...so we put our trust in him, and dig in. Uni is good, Blue Crab is sweet, but the tuna lacks its glistening fresh appearance and again, I'm hesitant, trying the Fatty Albacore which looks butchered and is barely cold, almost body temperature...I chase that bad feeling with my Iced Green Tea, then I ask where the tuna is from...his answer?  Hawaii...after tasting the mediocre tuna, I knew for a fact that it did not come from the 808 State and that this knock off sushi chef was playing me for a chump! I much rather have had that smaller Amaebi, but then again, who knows how fresh that was!?  Little did he know that he was messin' with The Goyemonstah......  Little did he know that the Goyemonstah was born and raised in Hawaii AND worked at a fishmarket with some of the best tuna from our own waters...  and VERY little did he know that The Goyemonstah wanted to reach over the display case and.....Never mind!  We ditched the nigiri section and ordered off the appetizer section-Miso Black Cod, Hamachi Kama, and a few Yakitori-Bacon Wrapped Quail Eggs, Bacon Wrapped Asparagus, and Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushrooms. I expected Yakitori items and the grilled fish items to arrive on separate plates, but what we got was a pupu platter complete with orange slices delivered by the former Blue Ribbon sushi chef himself with everything on the same plate! The flavors from the Miso Black Cod and the  \"Ha-Ka\"(Half of a Hamachi Kama, not to be confused with the war chant that the New Zealand All Blacks perform before they prepare to kill the opposing team) all blended with the Yakitori which was a big fail in presentation. They probably tested the other half of the Hamachi Kama for freshness? We ordered a some scallop, salmon, and saba nigiri, still just okay, and the cure on the saba was barely evident.  I order a Shark's Tale, Wild Fire, and What's Wrong? Roll. The Shark's Tale mentions tempura snow crab...it is tempura imitation krab. Wild Fire Roll was okay and the What's Wrong roll was swimming in sauce and was alright. I think our Yuzu Sherbet and Green Tea Ice Cream were sadly the highlights here. No half rolls allowed until your last order, and only one dessert per person FYI....  Shady quality of fish, lack of presentation and witnessing lots of shortcuts(they don't make their tamago, and soft shell crab is fried, chopped, and prepared way in advance-YUCK!) does not warrant a return visit here....ALOHA!!!",

Now let me save you the trouble by saying that I will not read hate mail so don't bother as I am sure you will also not bother in making any necessary changes for ALL patrons to be fully satisfied when dining here.    We came here on a Saturday evening and it was completely dead which was the first red flag.  We had heard good things by a few peeps so we decided to give it a go.    We started with a few skewers and a kama  or I should say half of a kama which were all crowded all on the same plate thrown over a bed of cabbage accompanied by an overpowering smelly orange slice. AWEFUL!   Everything we ordered looked nothing like the pictures we saw on yelp. No wonder they frown on picture taking.  So disappointed that I stopped at the second order and could not go on.  It gets worse ...the \"sushi chef\" also kept shaking his head NO on certain items suggesting they were not of good quality. I noticed that my husband kept ordering other items as if trying to convince himself that it couldn't get worse...but that's all they serve here and he soon realized they just could not be saved.  They also do not offer half rolls and offer 1 dessert per person and with too many restrictions at an all you can eat joint makes for a very un-fun experience all together.   There is just way too much competition out there and you unfortunately only have in many cases one attempt to cause a good first impression with me. GOOD LUCK!!",

    "text": "It has been a really LONG time since i've been really wowed by sushi. I came to a point in my life where I really questioned whether or not sushi, in general, has become perpetually trite. After visiting Daisho, my opinion of sushi has changed. This is now my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, and what they are doing here is surprisingly wonderful. Here's why:  First, after walking in the door and being seated by the server at the bar, we were given our menu's. They had the expected items you would see on any sushi menu, but after looking at the appetizer menu, you can tell that these guys are trying to do things distinctive. We had the AYCE menu for 25 bucks, and Tony T. and I started our voyage through this unique menu.  Note: We tried a great volume of items, so I would probably max out the 5000 character limit on Yelp reviews by describing only 1/4 of what we had. There was zilch that I didn't like on menu, but there some dishes that are especially noteworthy.  : Salmon Collar/Yellowtail Collar - This was unbelievable. I was totally blown away, especially by the salmon. The first time I had collar of a fish was at Yonaka, and it was wonderful. On the other hand, the collar at Daisho completely blows Yonaka's out of the water!!! Wonderfully tender, with the natural fat sustaining the moistness of the fish, personally (especially with the salmon), I thought I was eating foie gras. It was prepared with an expert hand, and cooked with precision.  It absolutely melted in the mouth. I'm still thinking about it.  : Uni and Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - Freshest and highest quality uni and salmon roe i've ever had, EVER. The uni had a delicate, but firm texture, and had a clean taste. The same goes for Ikura as well.   I FINALLY found a place that makes sushi rice correctly!!!! A great deal of people think that it's effortless to create great sushi rice. What folks don't realize is, that in world-class sushi restaurants, sushi apprentices and beginner trainees spend 3-4  (or more) YEARS learning just how to make rice, before they are given the permission to touch a piece of fish. Making sushi rice in itself, is an art form. And these guys nailed it.  A small footnote: This locale is great for low-carbers. There are more than 5 rice less rolls and plenty of apps that do not contain starch or rice, including collar, poke, oysters, yaki-tori and more!!",

Thanks to their grand opening special where regular rolls are 50% off, I find myself sitting here super full--much fuller than I expected anyway. It sounds like the special pricing will be ending any day now. Still, their regular rolls are very reasonably priced (from $4.50 to $6.50).  I (over)ordered the Alaskan, Eel, Salmon Skin, Spicy Scallop, and Spicy Yellowtail rolls. I didn't care so much for the Spicy Scallop and Spicy Yellowtail, but the rest was good. The simplest and cheapest turned out to be my favorite (the Alaskan, consisting of salmon and avocado).  I'm happy that we finally have a nearby sushi place for lunch again. $20 AYCE for lunch is a good price. I just don't have that kind of time. I'm eyeing their lunch specials menu for next time.",

There are so many roll options, much more than I've seen at other popular sushi places in Las Vegas, and it includes appetizers and a dessert.   Awesome part was that there was no crowd, no waiting, and super fast service and of course everything was super delicious.   So next time I want sushi instead of waiting an hour or something just to get a seat and then another 30 minutes before ever seeing food, I'm going to be coming here! By the time other people just sat down to eat I'll already be full, happy, and done.",

    "text": "Another AYCE sushi joint in Vegas??    The reason why I am giving them 5 stars :  Yakitori is GREAT.  Asparagus, Enoki, Quail Egg...all great!  Great sauce, great cooking consistency...yummy!  The Apps...some great ones here.  The Ahi Poke was plentiful and fresh, Oysters were smooth and also fresh tasting, Sake Kama was delicious and cooked perfectly (unlike the Hamachi Kama).  Nice to change it up a little besides just the run of the mill sushi.  The ROLLS.  I don't usually eat rolls...I am more of a nigiri guy myself.  But the few rolls I tried actually impressed me!  They aren't completely drenched in heavy sauces, and have lots of flavor!  The ones I enjoyed most :  Starfish : Yellowtail Tempura, Tuna, Daikon, Ponzu, and Wasabi Oil. Delicious!! Best \"roll\" I had here, especially since there is no rice!  I'd order this every time I am here!  Wild Fire : Spicy Tuna, Chopped Albacore, and Garlic Sauce. This was pretty good...lots of fish in each bite.  What's Wrong Roll : Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Masago, Rainbow Fish, and Screaming Orgasm Sauce. I liked this roll as well...the soft shell crab adds a nice taste and consistency.  Overall, the nigiri was also fresh and tasty.  I enjoyed the Uni here, Salmon Belly, Garlic Ahi, and Hotate.  Good cuts!  Finish off with some Plum Ice Cream! I enjoyed this much more than the Yuzu...good stuff!  They also made us some bacon ice cream...good!  Very clean restaurant, and the servers and staff were very fast, efficient and friendly.    Pics :",

    "text": "Had ayce lunch ($19.95ea) for two here on a Sunday noon and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant didn't have very many patrons at the time we came in, maybe five or six other tables aside from us so service was super fast.  Our food was being delivered almost faster than we can eat them, old plates being taken away just as quick, and our beverages never less than half full.  The facility was also sparkly clean as what you can expect from a brand new spot.  We were able to sample the majority of their nigiri and found them to be very good overall.  The fish were as fresh and had a good rice to fish ratio.  They do seem to make the nigiri a bit smaller than average, which I appreciate since this gives you the opportunity to sample other items on the menu and not get full too quickly.  I also feel that you can get a better taste of the food if you're mouth is less stuffed per bite.  We also sampled a good number of their yakitori and totally loved each one.  This is probably what sets them apart from other ayce joints.  Sure you can find yakitori elsewhere but their bacon-wrapped yakitori items here is exceptional, one of the most flavorful I've had in recent memory.  We also had both the salmon and yellowtail poke and thought that they were good too, though nothing compared to poke from poke express.  While there are plenty of ayce sushi places in the valley, there are only a handful that are really worth going back again and again.  I'll have to go back here again to be sure and to evaluate their consistency but Daisho sushi looks like a keeper to me.  I would rank this place in the same class and category as Yama and Goyemon in overall food flavor and dining satisfaction.  The best part of it is that Daisho is slightly cheaper in that lunch is only $19.95 and dinner $24.95, where the competition charges 1-2 bucks more.",

    "text": "Prompted by glowing recommendations from trusted friends, I finally made a return visit almost two years following my initial ROTD-earning write-up of Daisho Sushi. What I got was an enjoyable AYCE sushi meal that hadn't diminished in quality much if at all.  I'd been due to eat sushi with one of my pals for a while, and I convinced him to try this place instead of the usual \"Mon\" restaurants. We were planning a lunchtime meal, and Daisho still allows you to pay for the $25.95 AYCE dinner at any time of the day if you want to get access to special menu items (many of which are one-per-person).  I forgot to ask about whether they still offer fresh wasabi, which is a highlight at my favorite place. Oops.  An additional page has been added to the AYCE menu recently, and this one has various extra tapas/appetizers, some sashimi (one-per-person, dinner only), and some special rolls. My friends had cautioned me to steer clear of the pork belly and the sizzling beef, so I can't report on those. The takoyaki was surprisingly good, with a crispy exterior, tender interior, plentiful bonito flakes, and tasty sauce. The biggest drawback is that the actual tako (octopus) is a pretty small piece.  I also enjoyed the soft shell crab tempura (definitely use the sauce), the yuzu chili salmon \"salad\" (basically a sashimi), and the sashimi portions of super white tuna and yellowtail w/ jalapeno, but the portion sizes (e.g. nigiri cuts instead of True sashimi) were quite modest considering that these were all one-per-person. The relatively worst item was the ika butter (squid cooked in a sauce), which was a little chewy and forgettable flavor-wise. Lastly, the Iron Man roll (super white inside, tuna on top) was good and still quite palatable at the end of a huge meal.  The appetizers on the classic menu were just as good as before. Bacon enoki was my lone yakitori order. The bacon was meaty and smoky, though still lacking crunchiness, and the enoki was soft yet still has that snap. Miso black cod was still great, although I've tasted a better version of it and therefore don't think the world of this one. The yellowtail collar had meaty portions and fattier, more tender bits. Plus, after one past negative kama experience, \"not burnt\" is a positive. The fresh oysters were on the small side, but they were really good. The fried oysters were similarly small, which is unfortunate because it's linked to the fresh oysters as one-per-person. Lastly, the baked green mussels were cooked properly and not overly sauced.  Nigiri is still the sushi mainstay, and Daisho delivered for the most part. I loved the flavorful blue crab. The uni was as good as you expect to get in the AYCE quality range, and the amaebi was nice in spite of being a little mushy. Scallop (the good stuff, not bay scallop), yellowtail, and salmon were tasty. The fatty albacore wasn't flavorful, and the default wasabi sauce didn't help. The biggest letdown of the meal was the super white. I realized after ordering the super white tuna salad (a new, one-per-person menu item) and the super white nigiri that (1) they sauce all of their super white with this slightly spicy condiment, and (2) the quality of the super white itself is significantly worse than what other local places offer.  Dessert is one item per person. I won't dock them for what is unfortunately a common policy among these restaurants, but it's always enjoyable to have more dessert. I chose the fried banana this time, and I'm wondering now why I didn't order it in the first place. It's like the banana split in that it's topped with so-called vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles, but the banana pieces are fried and give a richness and a warm temperature contrast. Just like last time, I happened to have some leftover bacon to throw on top of this. Just like last time, I enjoyed it. Best AYCE sushi menu hack ever.  It was not very crowded at 1:30-ish, and they provided the expected quick service. The first round of items came out in quick succession from the chefs/kitchen after they'd handled the few other tables' orders, and other rounds seemed to arrive faster. Empty plates were quickly removed too. The only issue was that the server didn't seem to understand that we were ordering for each other or for \"the table,\" so to speak. For example, when we tried to order sashimi for the first and only time, she stopped us and told us that it was one per person. We had to start over and have me call for super white, and him call for the yellowtail. No biggie, but something to be aware of.  Along with the other minor food blemishes, the super white deficiency is why I've decided that I can only give four stars to what's otherwise a solid AYCE sushi restaurant. If you've been to a favorite AYCE sushi place too often and need to change it up, or if you want dinner variety at lunch hours, Daisho remains as good as any secondary options.",

To make matters worse, my husband was done eating his meal before they even caught the fish for my first roll. There were two people at the bar and us. I saw 3 chefs and 3 servers while I was here.

Not very nice about it and though could have been handled better. Some of the dishes were good but not very impressed with the rolls. They put too much rice on the rolls and the taste was more Americanized rather than more authentic Japanese food. Probably not going to go back to this place since there's other places better and closer to where we live.",

They will cut you off early of your \"All You Can Eat\" (you will notice obviously when they do) they have to be doing it on purpose to save money its hilarious but i never cared because i would get my full order in ASAP as i realized the \"cut off\" pattern. I've spent good money at this place because i enjoyed their food but that was also questionable when your puking the next day after a visit and the service is a 50/50 success rate. Tonight was my last visit officially as they had terrible service once again and i had a party of 8 ppl, not only bad service but THEY DID NOT even honor a friend and my own all you can eat dinner cards on SEPARATE checks. The stamp card reads you have to eat 10x All u can eat for 1 Free, Dinner being $27-$28 basically meaning we spent $560 roughly to earn the 2 ($56) free. They only honored one actually AND STOLE OUR SECOND CARD (who creates a whole new punch card and tries to lie about it??) with 6 stamps on it already and gave me one back with 3 when they should have filled the 6/10 stamp card with 4 more stamps as we had 7 \"ALL YOU CAN EAT CUSTOMERS\" tonight and added 3 extra stamps to a new/next card. I did not know it was this hard to do math for these people but thats obvious too since it took 1 hour NO EXAGGERATIONS to figure out our separate checks with our cards. I love great service and tip VERY WELL brought a big party of friends from out of town and didn't expect such a terrible experience, just to argue over a petty all you can eat for free card. These ppl are cheapskates and i would suggest all future customers to not to waste your time with this place, but u never know might catch them on a non-cheapskate day.",

The waiters/waitress definitely make it very clear that placing an order is a huge inconvenience to them (I'm sorry but isn't that their job?).  It felt like pulling teeth to get anyones attention.  I was able to try 2 rolls which were good, wanted to try another but after waiting a long time to get anyones attention I decided I was done spending any more money at this place.  I was with a friend who decided to order more food and kept thanking the waiter but everytime she did he kept rolling his eyes and throwing her orders down on the table...never once smiled or acknowledged her thanks.  If this business wants to succeed in their current location I suggest getting new staff.  I for one will not return to this establishment and will be surprised if they are still in operation in a few months, no one should pay for terrible service.",

The difference is deep fried, hence the word royal. When this happened the third time, the manager told me that the waiter who was making this mistake was new. He did not offer to exchange the roll. Considering that we eat there so much and have never had a complaint, I was disheartened that he responded with an excuse rather than fixing it.",

Went during lunch time and although there were several other parties, it wasn't too crowded on this Friday afternoon.   We went with the all you can eat menu which was $21.95 plus tax per person. Very reasonable considering how much sushi usually costs.  There are some items on the menu which can only be ordered during the dinner hours which costs a little bit more ($25.95), but there were only a few of those items...  The service was quick and you can order as much as you want for a 60 minute duration. But don't over order as you will be charged extra for anything that is left that you aren't able to finish.  You are also able to order other items while you are eating so we just ordered as we are which worked out well.  Not only all that, but the sushi was very good.  Tasty and well cooked.  They also have dessert on the menu which you are able to order once you are done with the sushi.  Would definitely eat here again!!",

The bonus is that they have happy hour specials (half price sushi) and an all you can eat option.    I ordered three rolls (rainbow, 007 and Dragon) to curb my appetite.  Overall I was expecting something much better than what I got.   It may have been the fact that the California part of the rolls was a salad mixture not the pieces as per the norm.     The flavor was ok but it just didn't hit the mark for me.   I out that error on me because I probably took it for granted.   I did like the happy hour option so that was a bonus.

At this point I was so upset that I walked up to the register and waited there for our check. If I was rating this restaurant according to customer service, I would give them a big 0.

The tempura was super thick, like the batter has been sitting out. The food portion for The bento was not worth $14 . The worst part of the experience would be the waitress. When ordering food she had attitude and rolled her eyes. When asking questions about the food on the menu . She didn't come often to check on our table or to refill our water . The night was super slow and there were only two customers present That I counted . This place is not worth going to and I wished I would of listen/read the other reviews posted about the over priced food and lacking service. Nether less I will not be returning but I do recommend everyone to try Blue Fin sushi on sunset . Service is always on point , food is authentic and delicious, and super/more affordable.",

They do it all. Their miso soup is awesome. Their garlic tuna is to excellent and has great flavor. Choices for desert are so so... fried bannana, bananna split, or the typical ice or mochi but I've been to other sushi places that only offer the typical Japanese deserts so this didn't bother me at all.   Customer service both behind the bar and outside is fantastic. We never had to ask for refills as they were dine automatically and our empty plates never sat for more than 2 minutes. The sushi chefs are very friendly. They take time to talk to you and have a conversation while they make food.   We will definitely keep coming here when we are in the area.",

There is a wonderful sushi chef here that used to work at Oyshi on Sahara. He is amazing in his own right and can pump out some amazing signature creations catered to your taste. I ventured here with a coworker and chowed down on some rolls and nigiri. She ordered a few of the fried appetizers and enjoyed them all. The nigiri was fresh and the specials were surprising for a lunch menu price. The sharks tale roll was tasty. The salmon and hamachi nigiri were so fresh we ordered multiples. We will definitely be back for more lunch excursions as the prompt service and quick ordering makes for plenty of time to waddle back into the office within a decent amount of time.",

Today they told me that I'd have to pay half price ($13) for my daughter if she were to share with me, whom is only 30lbs. This was very misleading as the previous times I never had to pay for her and no where on the menus or displays does it say they charge depending on age. The all you can eat menu even says that children can share with all you can eat parents. She's 5 years old but because she's so small she eats just as much as a 2 year old. I ended up ordering her a full plate of yakisoba (this was the cheaper choice) for $7 which she barely put a dent in. We took nearly the whole thing home. When I spoke to the manager, he said that it was a normal thing and they have always charged. He said they always charge based on age because children eat at varying levels. I told him to look at her and look at how much she ate (or didn't) and he continued to argue with me. After arguing back and forth I thanked him for his time and told him I will never be back but he didn't care. He really needs to clarify this, fix the menu, and most of all fix his customer service skills! I should be reporting this to Channel 8, Consumer Reports, and/or BBB!",

Everything was deeeeeeeelicious & good presentation too!  The tempura sauce really stood out because it wasn't like the normal tempura sauce, it was a lot better - really flavorful. The food portions were a good amount for the price. They also have AYCE sushi. Happy hour is from 3-6 pm and 9-11 pm. Half off chef's special rolls. The lighting was nice & bright.

Whenever she gave me a plate or took one away I would always thank her but after getting no response and a blank face, I stopped thanking her. I ordered nigiri ( 2 orders of tako, spicy crab, spicy tuna, garlic tuna, and tai). The first order of tako nigiri came with a small thin slice of lemon and the second order did not come with lemon. So a little inconsistent there but other than that everything was good. Items that are only available for dinner should be clearly noted on the menu. The server said everything with an asterisk under the specialty roll is only available for dinner.  There are way more items throughout the menu that have an asterisk before it so I was kind of confused and had to double check that the poke is included with the AYCE lunch. For appetizers I had the yellowtail poke, enoki bacon yakitori and shrimp bomb. The poke was good but I prefer mine without seaweed. I did not like the shrimp bomb. The shrimp yakisoba was ok. If I see different servers before I go in, I may eat here again.",

The sushi rice was not properly cooked, mushy on the outside, crunchy on the inside.  The rolls are thin, not rolled tight and lacked any of the usual cucumber/avocado or toppings/sauces.  The tempura was definitely NOT made to order, hence not crunchy but rather stale, the California roll had nothing but imitation crab, again no cucumber etc.   I was rather excited to see this place as it is conveniently located on my way home from work.

Thinking it may be this restaurant I call to ask the manager what the charge would come up as under a banking statement, as often the name of the restaurant is not the name of the company doing business as the restaurant in question.  So the woman who picks up the phone does not only not want to hand the phone over to the manager/owner, but asks who is calling, I say \"one of your customers, I am just trying to figure out if the charge I have on my bank statement is correct\"  and she says all of a sudden he is not present at all.  I said I would call back and she asks well \"why are you calling?  Do you want to order?\" I say no I am calling to figure out if a charge is correct, her response; \"Well who is charging you? What statements are being made?\" I politely tell her she doesn't understand the proper meanings of these words, so I will call back later when the manager/owner is back.  She says: \"He wont be back for a few days.... Would you like to order?\"  Wow.  I will never come back here again for not only being treated this way when I am trying to be polite and just talk to the manager, but also for the fact that she won't let me talk to the manager, and third for accidentally finding out that this is the type of place where if you need the owner's/manager's help correcting or verifying a transaction that this is the sort of response you would get.  On a side note: the food was ok, I have had better, but since it is literally across the street I would be here every few days.... not anymore.",

Then I went back a week later this time there was 3 of us. This time there was one huge difference. The staff remembered us from the previous weekend. So our sushi was packed with double the rice. This made it a horrible experience all you could taste was the rice. We said something to the server that there was more rice than last time. She dismissed the claim but did admit to remembering my group. After she walked away she went to the other servers and spoke to them in japenese. Next we could tell they were talking about us. Also I notice the chef was staring at us. I'm 100 percent sure they doubled the rice portion so we wouldn't be able finish so they could charge us extra. That is a shady way to run all you can eat.

I hope they continue that special for a long while because they will definitely continue to see me...I've dined in a couple of times and choose to sit at the sushi bar because I've received great service each time & the chefs always make good conversation, the owner is always there and is so friendly, he always makes his rounds around the place and tries to greet all the customers, he personally introduced me to their new happy hour deals which is also great (half off all specialty rolls), their spicy ahi roll recipe changed since they first opened and is a little more spicy and i personally prefer their old one better, but I've had quality food on each visit and will continue to frequent the place",

Everything was spot on and the Chef behind the bar asked my girl and I if we like x, x, and x to which he then created something from those items. Get the Bacon Wrapped Mushrooms or Quail Eggs for sure. My Iced Tea was never below Half. And even though we were getting close to closing time they never mentioned or made us feel rushed to leave. Very good experience.",

Getting our car serviced near by and yelped Daisho as the closest and highest reviews in the general area and took a shot. Went for the lunch $21.95 all you can eat and wow, talk about taking you for a ride. Guys I know it's all you can eat but really way too much rice to fill you up..the proportions are just greedy. Not only that but the fish wasn't fresh, especially the mackerel (which for those who eat it, it's naturally fishy already) was brown and old looking/tasting. If it's not fresh, why serve it. Sorry to go back to the rice, it also was undercooked, had some crunchy pieces that were dry. Hate that.   Service was lackluster. They don't even say hello and goodbye when you leave as in traditional Japanese restaurants. It's funny my wife said even how they walked look like they were dragging their feet.   We complained, paid $70 for two adults and a child, and left hungry because we didn't want to order just to order.   It's sad because the place looks like it would be a good neighborhood sushi joint, but look elsewhere...NO DAISHO FOR ME.",

My second point would be how well set up the place was, I love the little fish tank by the bar.   However, I know I will not be returning, only for the 1 reason that made the experience horrible. There is 1 apparent regular that pushed the limits of being loud and obnoxious. He sat at the bar verbally bashing just about everyone and everything in the place during his drunken stupor. The staff seemed to enjoy him being there and appeared to like him so I quietly finished and left, but clearly the workers here like being called slackers and librarians, so it's all good.   I would definitely recommend the food, but won't return to the environment myself.",

I just have one issue when I ask for a roll with soft shelled crab, I am expecting soft shelled crab and not imitation crab meat. I was told it was they way the person mixes the soft shelled crab. This is the first time here I have had to experience soft shelled crab in the texture of imitation crab meat. This is the second place that has had me question wether the soft shelled crab was actually that. I tore the sushi roll (burning night- mixed green onion, masago, onion, spicy tuna, albacore, jalapeno on top, garlic sauce)  apart and it taste and texture was imitation crab meat. Now they all taste great just wanted the texture that I was looking for in the soft shelled crab. Also the price during happy hour is very reasonable.  *Shark's Tale - Lobster, Salmon, Snow crab tempura, avocado with eel sauce *Las Vegas Roll (no rice) - Yellowtail tempura, Kaiware, Crab meat, Masago/cucumber layer, Spicy yum sauce *Burning night- Mixed green onion, Masago, Onion, Spicy tuna, Albacore, Jalapeno on top, Garlic sauce",

It's OK. ~$4 for 2 pieces (which is standard) - but I could go without it next time. + Rolls are 50% off during happy hour - score! Most of them are cooked.. I tried the Snow White and Sharks Tale. The Sharks Tale has a bit of wasabi mixed in with the Salmon and Snow Crab but it's bearable. I never have wasabi and was able to eat this with no problems.. The Snow White is one of the rolls that isn't cooked. As much as I prefer something raw vs. cooked - I'd have to say the Sharks Tale was the best of these two rolls.  + Hot green tea. Roughly $2 (I think it's like $1.75 or something). It comes in a tea pot which is great so you don't have to keep asking for refills. It comes in a tea bag.   If you're staying at the Doubletree this is a good nearby option. I could be within walking distance - just depends if you want to walk 1.5 miles one way or not. I'd rather Lyft =)",

Did the AYCE and started with   salmon poke -- it is mixed with seaweed salad. this i would rate 2/5, taste was ok but too much seaweed salad mixed with it.   uni -- it was good, 3/5.  amaebi (sweet shrimp) - 3/5.  lobster roll - 3/5, i did not taste lobster in it and the wasabi mixed in it overpowered it.  also ordered a couple of regular rolls like the scallop and salmon yum yum, 3/5-- all were room temperature which was a little weird.  what disappointed me was when i ordered 'rock and roll,'  i thought it was mostly sashimi of fish but it was fish inside shave cucumber -- mostly cucumber that'll fill you up moreso than the fish --  i did not expect it to be like that and ate all my fish, the waiter came to me and said \"WE WILL CHARGE YOU EXTRA IF YOU DO NOT EAT the cucumber\" so I made sure I finished all the cucumber.  i've been to a lot of sushi place and this was the first time this ever happened to me - i would have taken it better if it was said in a polite manner but no, it wasn't.   Steven, sushi chef- was amazing and tried making up for it (i told him ok, give me sushi that doesn't have a lof of rice in it) and he did-- but because i ate all the cucumber (rock n roll) i was so full of it, i couldn't enjoy any sushi anymore.  there was no manager that day so i finished off and left. I called the next day to let the manager know about what happened and she apologized, Apology accepted but I will never go back to this place -- there are TOO many sushi places in LAS VEGAS and for the quality and price -- I can easily go somewhere else and get an excellent service with the same caliber if not better, sushi.   in the end, i left super full of cucumber and very much disappointed. i would most definitely can give it a second try but my experience had me left with a bad taste in my mouth in more occasion than one.",

    "text": "You know that unassuming place in your neighborhood that you constantly pass by and mentally bookmark to try sometime, someday? Well, that's what Daisho Sushi was for me. Located in the same plaza as Walmart Neighborhood, this little restaurant is great for a quick bite without the hassle of crowds.   It was practically empty both times we stopped in during their lunch specials from 11-4p, so happy hour and dinner might be a completely different story. Daisho has 50% off rolls and drink specials during happy hour and an AYCE option, but I can only speak of their lunch.  For around $8, my teriyaki chicken combo included: miso soup, salad, steamed rice, 4 pieces of california roll, and shrimp+veggie tempura. Suffice it to say, you'll leave full with leftovers. Collectively, I was also able to try their baked mussels (first timer), tofu (nothing special), siomai (kind of small) as appetizers along with a sweet cold sake (strong for me), which is served in an ice bucket.   Their digital artwork on the walls is pretty novel. A projector renders their centerpiece mural with movement and by the host stand, a marlin mount appears to be amongst waves... Overall, the service we received was fast and friendly. We'll be back to drop in again.",

All kinds of salads and chicken and different items on the menu. The sushi is great! Always fresh and made perfectly! You can even ask for them to do a roll a certain way and they do it! The seafood salad is incredible. May arrays of fish in the salad along with the most colorful produce ! They have great Oysters ( no limit)  and they have soft shell blue crab on dinner only limit 1 ( I believe)  I go there every time I am in town and have time!!! You will not be disappointed if you like fresh HIGH QUALITY food!",

    "text": "I probably didn't give this business a fair shake the first time around. I'll attribute it to being a rookie Yelper that wrote a snap review because my gullet couldn't be fed at a fast enough pace. Since I thought the sushi was good the first time, I should have stopped back again before I wrote my review to see if they would show their True colors, and they have. I have returned 6 times over the last year and the service has been significantly better.  There seems to be stability in the employee turnover as we have had the same servers on the last three visits. Everyone is more attentive and the waits to order more food are pretty much non existent. The kitchen seems to always be on the slow side, but the sushi chefs have consistently been more efficient compared to my initial visit.  In the last year, the actual menus have been replaced, but the content is pretty much the same. Keep an eye on the specials board because they'll occasionally throw something different into the mix, like blue fin tuna or jellyfish. More recently, I've been sticking to just the apps and nigiri, so I can't comment on the roll situation.  Sometimes the uni has me raising an eyebrow, but I think their sushi is just fine for AYCE level, and good enough to make return trips for $26 a pop when I'm in the area. The menu also has plenty of non sushi items which will keep my wife and daughter happy. Good job Daisho, we'll see you next time.",

Sure they have some shrimp tempura and cream cheese type rolls but that is so from all they offer there.  The food is top notch, eat at the bar during the week and the chef will treat you to some omakase style dining.  I liked Chef Danny.  My favorite is the One Night Stand, I get a half-order.  If this place offered more diverse no-rice rolls I would come in more often.",

We are patient enough people that we waited a half hour after eating the first round before our one year old started fussing and I finally had to wave the manager down to order another set of rolls. We ordered 5 and only received 4 which also took another 30 minutes of us literally sitting waiting at an empty table while our son only got more and more fussy. While we waited a female server cleared the leftovers from our table and asked if we wanted our check. WHAT?! We've barely eaten anything and if it's that noticeable to your employees that we look finished, why didn't our original server come ask if we wanted anything else??   This whole experience totally sucks because the menu is decent, my husband and I love a good sushi spot and this could've been our go to. We both work in the service industry and tip really well. This is the second time we've been ignored while eating here. I was just hoping the first time was because they were busy. Different servers though so it's now obvious that management needs to re-train the servers to be more attentive to their assigned tables.",

Was greeted by the waitress right away and sat at the bar. I got the typical AYCE Vegas Sushi experience...which is a good thing...trust me the AYCE Sushi joints in this town have a winning formula down. Fast, efficient with a large diverse menu.  The staff here is fast, efficient and friendly. The menu is also large and diverse. I liked all the nigiri and rolls I ordered. The are a few dishes that I would skip the next time I come here. I didn't care for the batter on the Soft Shell Crab Tempura or the Fried Oysters. To me, they were off...not a a fan, too oily for me...light, but greasy, not light and crispy. I would also skip the Pork Belly and the Yellowtail Collar. I've eaten much better Pork Belly at Korean Restaurants or Shabu Shabu places, nothing stood about this one. The Yellowtail Collar is fine, its just a ton of white meat, felt like I was eating a fish steak, could be more tender and moist.   I can definitely seem myself returning.",

I ordered a tempura roll (not sure of the name, sorry) and it just tasted extremely garlicky for some reason. Not in a good way either. They use this garlic sauce on their edamame and it tasted like they poured that all over the roll, but the description said it was supposed to be eel sauce....so idk. I did order the Sun of the beech roll (not sure how its spelled at this restaurant)  and it was pretty good. The blue fin nigiri was also really good.  Just an okay place for me.",

Anyways, the sushi rolls were pretty good (esp. the Daisho and Starfish). The nigiri was a hit or miss for me. Some of their fish was obviously not fresh while the others were pretty good. I would recommend getting the yuzu salmon and garlic tuna. The seared salmon was not even seared at all and the scallops didn't have much taste to it. I would not recommend the chicken and beef skewers at all. They were pretty tough to chew and it was weird because they didn't look natural (I'll post pictures so you can see what I mean). It looked like they just blended the meat together and just reformed it into one piece. They ran out of the enoki bacon so I didn't get to try that one.   Anyways, this place is decent for an AYCE in the Henderson area. It's not the best, but not the worst. If you are in the area and are craving for some sushi, this place will get the job done, but if distance is not a factor, stick to places like Sushi Neko or Sushi Twister.",

Our date nights are always a success when we come here and it's always a lot of fun.",

The rolls that I selected were pretty tasty and the size of the rolls were perfect, not to large and not loaded with rice. The special came with \"salad\" and miso soup. The salad was not salad at all. It was a ramekin of shredded cabbage with a small drizzle of dressing. I found the miso soup to be weak.  My wife had the salmon tempura combo. The salmon and tempura were tasty but it came with a similar \"salad\" as my combo. We both ordered hot tea. This tea was so weak we wondered if the bag had been reused and we were surprised to find a $2 charge for it on the receipt.   The overall value was fair for what we received. There certainly was no home run hit here and we left smelling like deep fryer oil. If you have another sushi spot, stick with it.",

She was very rude about explaining how their 50% off on special rolls. My daughter only wanted an order of California Roll & she insisted we get two roll since it was 50% off but we told her no, she only wants 1 order of it but she still continued to say \"you should order two and just take it home is she doesn't finish\" and again we said \"no\". We go on with our order and she brings back a teriyaki crab roll & California roll. I told her we didn't order the teriyaki & she took it back with an attitude. They didn't much of a good option for dessert either. Restroom door was very hard to open especially for a child. We definitely will not be going back.",

The owner gives out cards for all u can eat after u buy 10 u get one free  then he tells u that u can't combine two cards to get the free all u can eat deal saying that it says on the card can't combine with any other! Offer ! It's the same offer lol its a free sushi just because u have two cards u can't get the free one that's so stupid and contradicting.   I mean after paying for 10 all u can eat to get one free what difference does it make ,Plus the quilty of the fish is getting bad the tuna with garlic had that white kinda nerves in it turned my stomach real sad when people just care on or about the money instead on how they treat there customers and the quilty of the food that's how a business goes under I won't be going back bye bye!   I'll be going back to sushi mon there the best by far!",

I posted a photo of rainbow roll with just a little piece of fish on top and a scallop roll with almost nothing but rice. Went here for lunch $20. All the good items on the menu that actually have fish in them and are not full of fillers are only available on the dinner AYCE menu $25. However, after seeing what they put in regular rolls I doubt there is much in them either. They have a 50% off regular rolls promo but there is nothing in them except rice and a flavor of some fish. Too many other good sushi places around here to ever come back here....",

During our trip to vegas we were looking for a good sushi restaurant which didn't cost a small fortune, and that's exactly what this restaurant is. The space is tiny, so we were lucky to wait just a few minutes. We ordered the sushi and sashimi combination, which were great, but don't miss the yellow tail. It's something to be remembered !I have eaten at a number of sushi joints in my time and I must say that the sushi is not the best but is good quality for this price even better! I am not crazy about the size or decor of the place. I was skeptical at first, but my friend and I both went into it like virgins. We were amazed at the quality of the sushi.",

    "text": "Half off sushi happy hour, and if you buy $30 worth, you get a free cocktail! Good deal right? The girl we had as our server was a gem, so sweet! But a guy that came by made me feel ashamed for taking advantage of the deal. I ordered enough for leftovers the next day (and yes, I know sushi is only good for a short amount of time), but he said he thought I ordered too much and encouraged my friends to eat some of my food. I'm the type of person that feels bad saying anything negative about anyone (I even feel bad about rating them down 1 star) but my friends even thought he was a little out of line. The sushi was delicious though! I'll enjoy my leftovers tomorrow.",

In Vegas for the night, I Yelp'd to find a sushi place nearby and this came up.  Their prices are quite reasonable but when you do the \"All You Can Eat\" special, you really can't go wrong!  I had all of the above along with octopus, halibut, salmon, yellowtail, seaweed salad, and a few other dishes and along with a beer and large sake, my bill came to $33.  Again, wow!  The quality was excellent!  Michael is the greeter/manager/owner(?), and he was wonderful with his recommendations.  I'm coming back here when I'm in Vegas, and bringing the wife, whom I miss terribly.",

Everything else was just meh...the miso black cod was tiny, the bacon wrapped enoki was limp and the japanese lasagna was the worst I've ever seen, they wrapped it in foil and it literally fell apart when we tried to eat it.  The worst for me was the amaebi that I had to send back cause they were fishy smelling and looked all gray instead of pink and clear.  The fresh oysters were not so fresh either, their only saving grace was the uni, at least that was fresh.  Yeah- Daisho, I tried you and you failed me...on to the next one...",

The service was below average. Felt uncomfortable there. And it didn't help that the guy, who based on other yelpers picks might be the owner was rude! I ordered a Snow White to him, he took my order then walked away. 10 min later I realized he wasn't coming back and didn't tell other chef about my order so I had to order it again. Our rolls were good but based on other yelpers picks who know him, we got short sticked on our presentation... I like the radish noodles with my sushi!  Then they don't do half rolls and with all you can eat there are so many limitations. I agree with other yelpers that with all those limitations I can go somewhere else! Only certain appetizers are included in all you can eat, you can only do one each of the rolls with no rice, and because of those rolls I had to pay dinner price at lunch time.  I really want to like this place as they had good selection and all. But I didn't feel comfy... When chef gave me attitude when I said most places have a tiger roll and it's good I was like what??? And they weren't very nice to my kid who loves sushi and loves sitting at the bar cause most places make it fun for her! So due to all that I gave two for quality of fish and selection but when I go out I want to enjoy myself!",

We happened to notice Daisho just driving down the street and decided to give it a try at around 10pm.  There were a few customers at the bar, but otherwise the place was empty...and that surprised me.  We were glad to hear that there was a late night happy hour on both food and drinks.   We ordered a few different rolls (California crunch, spicy tuna),bacon yaki-tori, soup, edemame, saki, and some beers.  Everything tasted perfect.  Everything came out promptly and the waitress answered all of our questions politely.  The price was phenomenal, especially for the sheer amount of food that we ordered and the quality.  This will definitely be somewhere we frequent as we live just down the street and are always looking for some decent sushi later on without going on a long drive.",

I've been coming here since it opened a couple of years ago and I always come back and bring friends and family.  Their sushi is always fresh and the prices rock.  There is always something on special.  The happy hour menu a little of everything awesome!  They have a all you can eat for $24.95 lunch and $26.95 for dinner desert included.  I've had the all you can eat here before and they keep the food flowing as fast as you can order it but remember like most places who offer all you can eat sushi they charge if you have a lot left over.  So order as much as you can eat but don't waist.     I like a place that pays attention to customer service.  I don't think I've ever been in there when the one of the owners wasn't there. They keep a close eye on the business and it shows because the service is always good and the food is always consistent.  I can't say enough good about this local gem.  If you haven't checked them out you're missing out.",

I have to say that their menu features more options for all you can eat than most sushi spots in town. Normally your choices are pretty limited to plain or unpopular rolls. Fortunate for us, they allow you to order a lot of specialty rolls and give you the option of half or full servings. Lunch hour was pretty busy so I assumed it was good. I'm glad we went because it was great. Definitely hit it up for lunch if you have a chance. Great ambiance, service and friendly staff.",

We got a lot of the regular rolls because they were 50% off. I would've gotten AYCE but there was too many of us and not everyone wanted it. I ordered the spicy crab, spicy spider, garlic albacore, Alaskan, and eel rolls, and shrimp and crab tempura appetizers with my boyfriend. The rolls were VERY tiny. My favorite flavors were the garlic albacore and Alaskan, the others were very plain. I was really disappointed with the spicy spider.

Most of my order was the same as last time but we added the salt and pepper fish (5 stars), blue crab fried rice (5 stars), fried banana desert (9 stars) cheesy corn (3 stars) and poke (1 Star). The poke was literally the smallest portion I've seen in my life cut in the smallest pieces ever. Lol The blue crab fried rice was almost a full dinner portion and was great!!! The damn fried banana desert blew my socks off and I'm not a big banana fan....ha......ha! I cant wait to go back!",

Small insignificant charges that won't make a difference to the restaurant at all. I'd understand if I asked for a ridiculous amount like 5 or 6 sides. And the sushi was not bad. Unfortunately nothing to write home about. With so many sushi restaurant options I'd go w a million others before this place.",

Soooooo....looked at a couple of places on Yelp and Daisho Sushi was what we decided on on a Monday night.  We came here around 7pm and it wasn't busy at all. There was a total of 6 people at the restaurant...including my bf and I. We never do AYCE sushi....we like ordering a la carte. So spicy tuna roll is what we wanted to start off with. It was pretty good....you can't really fk up that roll. Next we ordered a Godzilla and Spicy Girl.  Godzilla was supposed to have soft shell crab but we barely got any in there. There were actually more crab meat and avocados than anything else! Spicy Girl was good....a lot of flavors going on with that one. Presentation was nice and they don't skim you on rolls....it was packed with yummy goodness. Specialty rolls ranged from like $10.95-14.95.  Restaurant is on the smaller side so I can imagine you might have to wait for a table during busy/primetime hours. Overall, it was simply A-OK. We MIGHT be back but there are plenty of other sushi places we go to before we decide come back here.",

    "text": "To date I've yet to meet a place that was as disappointing as Daisho sushi. I had went for lunch with two of my friends/co workers. A previous story about the owner had me suspicious enough. However two of us had never been and person number three was willing to give it another chance. Immediately it was evident that communication was lacking in this place. From the kitchen to the waitress. We started off with three waters to drink with lemon. The waters arrived timely, without lemon which I had asked for again. After that it took 20 minutes to receive them. Lemons that take twenty minutes? Ok...  Things didn't improve from there. I had ordered yakisoba noodles which again came out in a timely manner. The two sushi rolls I ordered however, as well as the sushi the other two ordered all took another 10-15 minutes to arrive. The place was not hugely busy, the food took way too long.  That being said, the actual meal was the most disappointing part. If I hadn't eaten the chicken yakisoba I'd be caps yelling a review. The yakisoba was ok, not something I'd order again but it wasn't bad. The sushi on the other hand was downright criminal. No flavor, yum scallops tasted like nothing and my spider roll had the feint hint of tempura flavor before fizzling out.  My friends didn't get any better than I did. Their rolls lifeless, badly rolled. I almost didn't take my left overs with me. Though I'm not one to waste food. Best part was one of the rolls which we never received and paid for since we needed to get going. Communication of course was horrible. Between staff owner and cook. We had even mentioned that if the roll wasn't started yet then it's okay, we will just cancel the order. The waitress assured us it was coming for 15 minutes, we left without it.  Simple point is this, don't come here. Blue fin is in the area. Down eastern and Maryland is yummy grill. Sushimon or Osaka is nearby. Go to one of those places and enjoy the food. This place is sadly run by someone with no passion for what good food is about. A most disappointing of findings.",

The greeter is quick and pleasant, we like to sit in the booths, it's nice they have the option of booth or table.  We usally have the same server, so it's nice to see familiar faces when we go.  They take your order, and then bring out the dishes.  We've never had a long wait, service and like water refills have been on point.    The food is fantastic!  Our go to items are the garlic tuna, wild fire, Johnny roll, and the green muscles. The all you can eat is around $25, plus you get a punch card after 10 ayce, you get one free, I think we are on our 3rd card :)  Everything we've gotten here has been fresh, and very tasty.  Highly recommend Daisho for a nice night out, or just a casual lunch.",

Or is it your clean up time? If so then change your hours because I believe you should service a customer fully if they are in your restaurant in time. But hey, that's just me.  Sushi places are a dime a dozen. You could literally eat at a new place once a week and who knows when you'll try them all. The sushi here is okay. Not bad, but not amazing. They don't offer anything original to them. I went here for convenience but I don't like feeling like an inconvenience.",

    "text": "Daisho was exactly what I was looking for on Friday afternoon when I stopped in for lunch. I had such a craving for sushi but was on a lunch break and needed somewhere close by but that would fit the bill. Inviting environment, good amount of people, friendly service and a whole lot of options.   I was pretty indecisive so I asked for a recommendation and my server mentioned the \"what's wrong\" roll, the Daisho roll and another of which I can't remember. They all sounded great but something kept pulling me back to the Warm Springs roll so I ended up ordering that. Crab mix, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna (although I subbed for regular tuna) eel sauce, yum sauce and I'm probably missing a few ingredients, but it was exactly what I was craving. Fresh, light but rich in flavor, satisfying, and a great portion. The roll was cut perfectly and didn't fall apart like some would say about other rolls made with rice paper, it held together even through soy sauce! Lol that's not the usual, am I right? Soy sauce seems to be the make or break sometimes, but not with this roll.   I initially started with a ginger salad which was fresh and light, great price point. And I also opted to try the spicy tuna cracker appetizer which was delicious! I'm a sucker for this appetizer at any restaurant but Daisho gave it their own twist and it was better than most I've tried. The avocado on top is such a nice, refreshing touch. The appetizer came with 6 \"crackers\" making this a shareable plate, which surprised me for the cost. Definitely love how reasonable and fair their menu pricing is!   If you haven't given Daisho a try, go for it, you'll be glad you did! I will definitely be back, thank you Daisho!",

Our server was standing there doing nothing and we couldn't get her attention to order more food or get water. The sushi quality wasn't fantastic and there were pieces of shell in my sushi from the quail egg. The salmon was the most disappointing :( it was the weirdest texture and didn't even look right. For the price of AYCE a person it definitely wasn't worth it. We won't be back.   Shout out to the bus boys who were the only ones running around doing things. Thanks for getting our servers attention for us. You guys deserve a raise.",

Also ranking very high is the price point, management, staff, service and authenticity. I literally drive by dozens of closer AYCE and other sushi restaurants to get to Daisho.  I have eaten there dozens of times over the years but have never written a review. When my family came in from out of town we went in for a visit. Not all in the party were sushi eaters. All left happy and satiated.  The all you can eat option is the best for me. They place a reasonable limit of two per person on the high end items for good reason. They are not even offered elsewhere. My favorite items are the sea urchin with a quail egg and the black cod. They now offer Happy Hour drinks for $5 including exotic tropical drinks such as Mai Tai's, Fog Busters etc - the full monte!   While they do offer sushi that is covered in toppings I always suspect are intended to hide the fact the fish is not the freshest - Daisho leads with fresh fish and follows through with it. They also offer a great many - no rice options for those on the Keto or other diets",

As for the food itself, the poke was delicious,  with a nice amount of seasoning. BTW, we are from Hawaii,  so we KNOW our poke. The sushi rolls were delicious.

    "text": "Some coworkers told me about Daisho and I've always gotta taste for sushi so I figured I should go in today and give it a shot.  I was not disappointed!    Location: It is located in a little plaza with a car wash, Walmart, and Chevron.  Kind of hidden but as long as you turn in one of the openings you're good since its all connected.  Food: I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box (you could choose btwn 3 other meats like beef, shrimp, or salmon maybe?).  The prices differentiated depending on which meat you select, but I felt like they were fairly reasonable in comparison with other restaurants.  The bento box lunch comes with miso soup (fyi there are tofu pieces in the broth, which I could def do without), salad, steamed rice, and shrimp/veggie tempura mix.  The teriyaki sauce used was more on the sweet side, but not to the point it was overbearing.  All the servings of each food item were a good portion and it satisfied my craving for sure.  Service: I was greeted and seated promptly when I walked in the door.  The waitress I had was very attentive before I ordered and was coming back every couple minutes or so ready to take it down.  I definitely appreciated that.  Going to other places and having to wait 10 minutes to order is THE WORST esp. when you only have an hour.  Once my food was delivered, she only came around once to refill my water, but I didn't mind it.  I paid my bill and was out in about 45 minutes.  Pricing: The CHICKEN TERIYAKI bento box was $8.95 +tax.  There is also a 30-cent fee when using a card, whether it is debit or credit you still get charged.  The waitress did not bother to mention this to me which I found odd, but whatever, no big deal.  I suggest visiting during lunch hours, 11 am to 4 pm, to get the best deal.  There is a Yelp check-in offer but only when your bill is $30 or more.  Also, AYCE sushi is available for $21.95 (lunch) or $26.95 (dinner) BUT someone warned me that they give you an hour limit.

    "text": "I needed a sushi fix and this has been on my list since we moved to town a few months ago. The young man at the front desk was very friendly and explained to me the happy hour specials and discounts and then took my order:  1 Philidel roll  1 California crunch 1 tempura udon $20  I am looking for a new sushi spot but I need the quality/quantity ratio to be equal as well as the price. This place did well on the price factor. $20 is reasonable for what I received. The udon broth was tasty and they gave me a big portion with tons of noodles and not to much seaweed. The rolls themselves were small but that is something I am finding to be commonplace with Las Vegas sushi joints. They were fresh, even the next day when i took them for lunch. Not too much rice, but I will point out I did not care for the white sauce on the California crunch roll. Also I wish there was more cream cheese in the Philadelphia roll.   The downside is: the customer service I received from the woman who brought out my food was very cold and ungrateful. She did not repeat back to me the items i ordered. I could have received the complete wrong order. Also, she put everything in one small plastic sack. See photo...my udon noodle bowl was leaking and crushed the box containing my rolls. I am also 100% sure they knew it was leaking because the bowl was wrapped in napkins. A message to management; please set the expectation that you want your customer's food to make it home by bagging large items separately as to not leak or damage other food. It would take 1 minute and 1 extra bag.   Despite the quickness of service and he quality of sushi I do not know if I will give this place another try. Like the other yelper stated- the music playing inside is horrible. Hyper techno does not mix well wish sushi dining. If I was getting AYCE sushi at this place I wouldn't stay beyond 2 plates so I could escape the music. Maybe that's the point?",

The service was attentive and it was busier for lunch but slowed down very quickly.   My friend loves their sushi which came with a salad at lunch and all together our bill was $18 so it's a very cheap place to eat...But the last thing I want to eat is cheap sushi.

I do enjoy their blue crab nigiri, as they actually use real crab, rather than imitation. Sushi service is pretty slow, even if they're not at all busy.. but the servers are pretty nice. It's not their fault the kitchen produces the sushi slowly... I go back here because it is convenient since its close to my house, and the sushi isn't terrible.",

The staff was very friendly, no complaints there. but will not come back due to the food. The only thing I liked were the mussels.

When I asked the waitress about the rating she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about until I pointed at the B rating card.  She told me \"it was an unannounced visit and they found fish that was defrosted too much and the air got to it.\"  I told the waitress and the sushi chef that we were leaving because of their B rating.    I looked up the rating system on the health district website and found to get a B rating they had 11 to 20 critical demerits and will get re-inspected within 15 days.",

The waitress approached our table & we ordered 3 sushi rolls and a bottle of wine, a moment later the manager walked up to our table & told us we should order the all you can eat sushi instead, he said we would be getting more for our money, so we took his advice and ordered two all you can eat for $24.95 each. Never were we told we had to eat every last bite of sushi on our plate or they would charge us and additional $10 leftover fee. We have eaten all you can eat sushi at least at a dozen other sushi diners and NEVER did they charge us a fee for not eating everything. The manager came up to our table yelling at us (while using profanity) when we said that we should not have to pay the $10 fee because there was no signs anywhere saying you had to eat everything on your plate or there would be a $10 charge (he said it was sushi law lol). I told him typically when I order all you can eat sushi they offer half rolls so you don't have much leftovers. Regardless, even when we had leftovers never did any place charge us for it. DO NOT EAT HERE. There are so many good sushi places in Las Vegas & Henderson, Daisho Sushi is very bland at best, but whats worse than the poor quality of sushi is the horrendous service this place has. I have never had a employee, much less a manager treat me so disrespectful, he didn't care there were other people trying to eat and children were present while he used profanity. This place I imagine will be closed down soon because of the tremendously poor service, plus they do anything they can to rip off their customers.",

The only complaint would be that the rolls were very small. I don't know if this is standard or because they have a grand opening special with 50 percent off their rolls. That is only reason I deducted one star UPDATE: we went back for lunch again. This time we had a crunch shrimp roll and a California crunch roll. They were both seemed a lot bigger. Especially the California crunch roll. Very good and at such good prices!",

I still have that Groupon because the waitress was kind enough to point out that the Groupon doesn't expire until January and they had 1/2 priced regular rolls as a Grand Opening special. I am a fan of the \"simpler\" sushi rolls anyway, so this was like finding a gold mine, and I have been going back ever since. Their sushi is already so reasonably priced (without the 1/2 off) compared to the rest of Vegas that this means their Grand Opening special (which was still going as of 11/16/13) resulted in $2-3 regular rolls.   The rolls are pretty standard and the ingredients are fresh. Considering I'm on a fixed income and a sushi addict, I couldn't ask for more from a sushi place!",

We've both been in the service industry for more then a decade and we were totally impressed from everything like the servers who were sweet and accommodating to the owner who not only introduced himself but engaged us in conversation even got our background and remembered our names when we came back the second time.  The sushi was great, but the attitude of the owner and his enthusiasm to make his establishment a success.  I don't see this much excitement and passion from someone very often in my business. It's so refreshing to see someone with that much passion about his dream. This will be our go to spot on date night from now on.  I look forward to tasting the next valley of fire or warm springs roll. Two of our favorites!

Roll was fantastic along with the tempura snow crab. The friend  banana for dessert is so tasty! The menu was great. I felt like the nigiri menu had more items on it then most other sushi places.

The first time was really good. Great selection, food was good,  sushi came out quickly, and the service was prompt.  The second time wasn't as good overall.  Food was still good,  but the service was lacking.  The third time was just atrocious!  The nigiri came out with the biggest balls of rice I've ever seen at any sushi restaurant, topped with the thinnest slice of fish.  It was so hard to eat. I literally had to drink water with the food in my mouth just to get the rice down.  We were waiting so long to get each of the things we ordered.  I brought up our concern to the waitress and asked if she remembered us from last week and she said yes. I told her that this wasn't the same experience we had then and the food was nothing like it was.  I got no response,  she just nodded her head and walked away to where what I assume is the manager and another coworker were standing.  It was obvious she was telling them what I had said.  The entire group thought it was funny. The manager didn't even bother to come talk to us!  The place only had one other table occupied, it's not like they were too busy. This last experience was a bummer because the place can be a really good find.  I recommend gambling on this place. That's exactly what it's been,  a gamble.",

Until one day (Friday) I was rather hungry and found myself driving to what ever caught my eye. And I saw that daisho had \"regular rolls 50% off\" and I do love my sushi and especially for 50% cheaper :)    At first viewing daisho from the exterior I did not find it very appealing . However when I walked it , I was presently surprised. It's interior is so pretty and the people were incredibly nice .   I am writing this review for the 2 times I visited daisho and both times they met my expectations and exceeded it.   The first time i got 4 regular rolls for $10 because it was BOGO free. They were okay but because I'm used to special rolls and haven't had a regular roll in ages .  The second time I went I went for the AYCE and OMG the choice in appetizers was ahhmaaazinng. ;) SERIOUSLY, your gonna give me salmon Kama? They also had skewers and I love bacon wrapped enoki mushroom however they did not cook it to my liking . And I was disappointed cause I was really looking forward to it. I'm scared of eating raw pork (because of my biology class). However everything else was really good ! I thought the food was about an 8 on a scale from 1-10 . But the thing that got me was definitely the service . I had jenny and Michael. Jenny was our server and she was so sweet and helpful. She was unfortunately the only server that night due to some mishaps she informed me about  but she still rushed to serve with a smile on her face .   So if you want good AYCE sushi, and excellent service that's cheaper than other places daisho is for you !",

    "text": "This place is a solid 2.5 so I have to be fair and round it up to a 3 star...  a.  Location - 5 star - On the southwest corner of Warm Springs and Eastern, very accessible from most parts of the valley. For us, it was a 10 minute easy drive from Henderson.  b.  Ambiance - 2 Star - A bit spartan in terms of feel and decor, however, that is cool. I would say the music was both loud and obnoxious.  Not sure how / why you would want your clients to dine in loud punkish modern music that is neither food for the soul or nurturing.  It was also loud enough that it nearly impeded conversation.  c.  Service - 2 Star - We got here at 6:00 and ordered two Bento type dishes and two AYCE sushi which comprised of about 5-6 choices.  Took about 50 minutes to get the first sushi after the two that had the Bento type boxes had theirs for about 15 minutes. I find that rather odd.  Also, when I asked for hot Green Tea, I was advised that they did not have green tea, but another kind.  I asked....is it Genmaicha and she came back with the little sweet tea bag that said genmaicha.  Well, I think I am a bit stuffy tea drinker because I like this type of tea in it's real form, a whopping two teaspoons of loose roasted rice and barley and tea leaves in a pot to steep and all the flavors of this very tasty tea.  Coming out of a tea bag..... nah.  d.  Food - 2 star - besides getting to us so late, here is the dealio:  - Bento Box with Teriyaki Beef - The beef was so dry and thin and overcooked and over sauced, it tasted like Costco Teriyaki Beef Jerky dipped in soy sauce. Wow. Both over powering and salty.  - Amaebi - This is a special dish I love because of the fresh raw shrimp and then the fried shrimp heads.  Where were the fried shrimp heads?  Come on, you cannot serve this dish half axx.  This is totally a boo hoo disappointing disaster.  - Maguro - I love to have Maguro Nigiri Sushi with a thin slice of lemon and thin slice of jalepeno. It really makes the taste perfect.  When you serve this with a SPAM size chunk of lemon and jalepeno, it actually over powers the Maguro and well, nigiri is all about complimentary and simple flavors, so this was a complete miss.  I had to remove all the lemon slices and jalepeno to make the maguro edible.  - Miso Cod, Hamachi Collar, Star Fish, Daisho Roll, Wild Fire, Mexican,   All the rolls were edible and uninspired. It did not help that they serve these sushi on huge American size platters instead of smaller plates that match. It was hard to fit plates onto our table, and it was very unappetizing.  e.  Overall - 2 star - really?  Food was barely adequate. Not prepared properly, Japanese is all about presentation and the food was poorly presented.  I was really shocked because after reading the review s I was raving to go celebrate my BD at this place and instead, I felt more like I compromised.   Worst part is that the place was empty for about 40 minutes and service was poor, then it was packed as so many groups came in, I had to go from shy asian boy to obnoxiously loud demanding diner boy and keep pushing for service, food and the bill...  I was shocked!  DAISHO in japanese means big victory or soaring large.  This place needs to change its name to something else....  GK says, OK, I was a year older and depressed.  Go check this place out.  I will come here again and give it a second chance. It was all me the first time........ Fried Shrimp Heads, here I come...",

We come once a week to see our favorite server.   When we came this past Friday, yes I'm aware it's a Friday in lent and a lot of people come to this place for a meat free meal. We came right after the rush and our server just seemed so tired or something. I mean she did mention her last table was 24 guests!!!   We usually get too notch service when it's just the two of us but as a group it was a bit of a longer wait.   I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for it again. My friends were just insisting we stay because it was a lot of food.   I did notice though after about 30 minutes of waiting, our server asked us all if we wanted soup or salad while we waited.  In that time we had already seen 3 other guests that arrived after us already chowin down!!  So we ended up waiting and had shoved our faces with delicious food right after the server dropped it off.   Like I said, it's much better when it's just 2 on a romantic date!  We will be back in a few weeks. Just think we need a little break for now.",

    "text": "Unlike many of the other restaurants I visited in Vegas, Daisho did more than satisfy my expectations. It exceeded them significantly. For a small sushi joint in an unassuming parking lot, the promise of a $27 all you can eat special seemed too good to be True. Now, it's fairly obvious that you'll never be getting the highest grade food here. The bluefin wasn't as buttery as it could be, the rolls tasted almost doughlike, barely masked by the propensity for American sushi joints to smother everything in sauce (and thus seek to veil their food's inconsistencies and faults), and the scampi erred more towards the tough and briny rather than sweet and tender. But for that price, does it really matter? As I was putting away a dozen pieces of seared salmon nigiri, I wasn't overly concerned with the fact that the momentary sear barely helped to balance the fridge-chilled salmon meat. I'm not the biggest eater, but the sheer amount of food I was able to put away in about an hour (the dinner option for $27 offers 90 minutes) more than made up for the deficiencies in individual items. But as I was continually reminded, quantity has a quality all of its own, and I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting a decently priced, high quantity restaurant away from the overpriced, overgreased and overrated venues that seem to plague the bright lights of the Strip. On the upside, the super white tuna/mackerel was smooth, the scallops were tender and I didn't have any problems in getting the waiters' attention. They were very attentive in clearing plates and bringing tea/water for the steady stream of locals that came through, and I can clearly see why Daisho is such a valued neighbourhood spot. I'd take it over another average steak and cheese-choked fries any day of the week.",

I spotted Daisho, and since the storm was showing no signs of letting up, I decided to go in.  I was so happy I did!!!  They had an all you can eat menu for 21.95.  The selection was great.  There was all kinds of appetizers, salads and desserts.  There was also a front and back page of sushi options that were included in the all you can eat price.  The only stipulation is that you must eat what you order, because they will charge you extra for wasted food.  I was alone that day, so I sat at the sushi bar.  I notified the sushi chef that I was pregnant and asked if he could let me know if anything I ordered had raw fish.  He went above and beyond and told me to order whatever I wanted and he would make sure he cooked anything that would have been raw.  Both of the sushi chefs working that day were very friendly and extremely attentive.  I ended up ordering 4 rolls in total. Had a cucumber salad and ordered a fried banana for dessert.  I highly recommend the Daisho roll.  I feel like I definitely got my money's worth.  I have been spreading the word about this great sushi place ever since, and I can't wait to go back!!",

The stuffed tomatoes (it's the name of a dish but doesn't actually involve tomatoes at all) are positively epic! The silky texture and fresh bright yet creamy flavor is borderline orgasmic. Service is good but the servers here tend to challenge orders which bothers me. I order something and get \"are you sure you want that?\" almost every time I've gone here. I'd love to try some of the salads on the all you can eat menu but I've been told the portions of the salads are big enough to be a meal on their own which is offputting because if I wanted just a salad and nothing else I wouldn't spend the money on all you can eat. The whole point of all you can eat, for me, is to try a variety of things. I've asked if I could just get a small portion because it's the same price either way with all you can eat but was told no. All you can eat sushi menus should be like Japanese dim sum, small portions big variety. This place has a huge variety but don't plan on trying much of it in a single sitting unless you're a competitive eater and be prepared to stand your ground when you ask for something like yum yum sauce on the squid instead of ponzu because they always seem to assume I'm a sushi virgin or something.",

Sushi was fresh and there were tons of options.  None of our sushi was over-sauces which I think is common in this town.  They have an amazing happy hour menu that is very robust in offering from 3-6pm. They also have an all you can eat option - which we didn't try but the couple at the table next to us did and said they come regularly and love it.  Super kid friendly too.  Highly recommend.",

They are so rude and it's just frustrating sitting at the bar. But location and sushi is great so we kept going to our favorite local spot. Everyone in there knows us. My husband is friendly and is heavily tattooed and therefore we are recognizeable. Every time we get all you can eat and they give us the stamp cards but we always seem to forget the old cards and thought we could combine them. Tonight we went in and they refused to combine our cards. We have 18 stamps spread out on 6 cards. That is good for atleast 2 free meals. They refused to combine our cards!! They know us!!! What's the big deal??? So greedy. I'm done. Terrible service and management.",

Anyways, I love ordering Uni- but I am always skeptical when ordering it, because LOTS of places have old uni, which is brown and dull and tastes bad. Uni should be orange, slightly firm- not too firm though- as its a soft type of food, and its tastey when fresh. LUCKY ME- they had fresh Uni! Which is awesome! Because I've been let down soooo many times before at other restaraunts.  I particularly LOVE their shrimp bombs. Also, they have no-rice sushi rolls, many of which are fantastic- Great for Diabetics. Its also next to a neighborhood walmart- so if you need to get groceries after... you're in luck.  I have not used the bathrooms here- so no comment. But the restaraunt is very clean, and has nice decor. There are TV's around. Its a slightly small place- but it doesn't get too busy so thats just fine. Lunch is the best time, as its not crowded, and its nice an quiet-ish.",

Our waters were empty almost the whole time and they didn't come back to check on us. There was like 4 or 5 waiters standing around talking in the very quiet restaurant. The food came out quick, fresh and hot. More people started walking in around 7:30. I would definitely recommend this place for their food (maybe take out) but not as the experience as a whole. The atmosphere is pretty cool though with a projector of a Japanese village across the entire back wall. Don't know if we'll come back.",

The fish was all pretty fresh and the rolls were made well. I would have given them 4 stars if service was a bit better. I know they were a little busy, but drinks went unfilled and our food came out slow. Their AYCE prices were reasonable and I have a Groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so I will be back.

One thing I would like to highlight though is that recently they started serving Ramen & WOW is it delicious. My Ramen came with a perfectly cooked piece of pork belly, an amazing broth that was rich & satisfying and an egg that was cooked to perfection & when opened the yolk oozed out into the hot soup.  The noodles in the Ramen were good, pretty much took a back seat to the broth and pork belly flavors.  I hope they keep this dish because it's outstanding & I'll be going back soon for more.",

Their rolls are so creative, I love Avatar roll the best, that was my favorite roll, they put steak on it with amazing sauce.

Ummm I have never really walked out on too many resteruants... but this was DEFINITELY one I could not stick around to continue.... =[ maybe it was a bad night... but one bad moment is a big turn off for me....  We weren't really greeted the server just kind of stared at us... then she came around & sat us... & was just a bit akward. No smile... no expression... no words really... she came around & got our order as we wanted to do AYCE.   Our first order came out and it was tuna wrapped around fried fish can't remember the name since the hubby ordered it... but a few minutes later a couple of our sushi pieces came out & literally I smelt a stench of fish...  HONESTLY fresh raw fish should NOT smell or have a STENCH of fish!!! But I thought maybe it was just one of the fishes on the plate so I ate my HALIBUT first & I couldn't swallow it.... =[  Then I turned the plate to have the hubby try... & the was a piece of short hair on the sushi.... !!!! O_o  then a salmon roll came out & that was all for my man but he put one roll in & then he spit it out... he said the rice was like MUSH in his mouth... rarely does he complain too much about food he just eats.... but if he can't handle.. BLAHHH   Seen some good reviews... but OMG I feel like I was totally tricked.... so we couldn't.. we told them to stop all orders... & WORST thing was.. when we showed the waitress the hair she said she will get a new one.. but right as I decided I can't eat here I went up to where she took the plate back... the chef was just placing the same fishes on a DIFFERENT plate...   SORRY but that was a sign I will NOT try this place again... =\\",

    "text": "We went here with a group of Yelpers. Honestly, I was having second thoughts about this place since the reviews seem inconsistent but with Tony T's guidance, we seem to have picked the right stuff from the menu. There were a few hiccups so I can't give this place shining 5 stars.  I tried the miso black cod, bacon-wrapped enoki, bacon-wrapped quail eggs, bacon-wrapped asparagus, yakitori beef, salmon poke, tuna poke, oysters, salmon skin handroll, uni, unagi, salmon, garlic tuna, amaebi, salmon collar, hamachi collar, Wild Fire, spicy tuna cracker, Starfish, fried bananas, red bean ice cream and yuzu ice cream.  5/5: I love bacon so obviously the clear winners for me were the bacon-wrapped quail eggs, asparagus and enoki mushrooms. Also, 5-star worthy items like oysters, salmon nigiri (super good!), Wild Fire (tuna, spicy tuna, soy paper, chopped albacore in garlic sauce. NO RICE) and Starfish (yellowtail tempura, daikon, scallion, tuna in ponzu and wasabi oil. NO RICE). Yuzu ice cream - I haven't been to an AYCE sushi restaurant that serves yuzu ice cream.  4/5: Salmon poke, tuna poke, garlic tuna, miso black cod (reminds me of Shiro's in Seattle), amaebi, salmon collar, spicy tuna cracker, fried bananas (get it with vanilla ice cream and well-rendered bacon topping) and salmon skin handroll (crispy skin).  3/5: Yakitori beef, uni (was a little bit watery), unagi. Hamachi collar was charred on the outside but undercooked on the inside. I was craving for some shrimp tempura. Melvin ordered it but it didn't look so promising and he said it was just ok so I didn't bother ordering it.  They give you real plates instead of the usual sushi plate and they'll give you a clean one if your plate gets really messy. The chef/owner kept checking on us and gave us beer on the house. After ordering 6-7 hamachi collars and 6-7 salmon collars, the restaurant smelled like smoke they had to keep the door open.  The service was great but I'm not sure if it's because we were with Tony or if it's because we're Yelpers or if it's because that's just the way they treat all their customers. I would have to come back again to figure that out...eventhough this is far from home, I wouldn't mind coming back here. $20 for lunch (11am-4pm) and $25 for dinner (4pm-close) and the food is pretty good. And no, they don't have pork belly.",

    "text": "Daisho Sushi is a moderate drive away from me (located in a large strip mall on the corner of S. Eastern and E. Warm Springs), but after making my way across town to try out their Dinner AYCE sushi, I am definitely a fan and considered the drive here well worth the effort for good food.  As the restaurant is still relatively new, they were not all that busy tonight (plus it was raining, and you know who people here shy away from driving under such precipitous conditions). So after being seated at the sushi bar, it was pretty much just me and Michael K here at the ~70 seats capacity sushi restaurant giving their menu a taste drive.  We started off with the usual limited to one per person orders:  Uni, Sweet Shrimp and Blue Crab nigiri, they were good.    We also gravitated towards their APPITIZERS section, and had ordered: * Salmon Collar (the salmon was so tasty and naturally fatty, it was amazing, like having \"Kobe\" salmon) and Yellowtail Collar (cooked just right and I really enjoyed it with and without the accompanied ponzu dipping sauce)  * Yaki-tori (skewers): Bacon wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Bacon wrapped Quail eggs, Bacon wrapped Asparagus.  At other restaurants you can order just skewers, paired with responsible consumption of beer and sake and call a great night out.  I really enjoyed these.  * Shrimp Bomb (it is like the Jalapeno popper with shrimp and crab, but without the jalapeno).  * Miso Black Cod - tasty!  Insane in the membrane that this is in the AYCE line up!!!  * Tuna Poki - the poki are prepared to order, not something that was made hours ago and left marinating in the cooler.  * Yellowtail Poki  SPECIAL ROLLS: * Star Fish (No Rice) made with Yellowtail Tempura, Daikon and wrapped in Tuna, finished with Wasabi Oil, Ponzu and Scallion.  (Recommended)  * Johny Roll (No Rice) made with Crab Meat, Shrimp Tempura wrapped in thin strip of cucumber and finished with Spicy Yum Sauce.  * Wild Fire Roll (No Rice) consist of Tuna, Spicy Tuna wrapped in Soy Paper, topped with Albacore and finished with Garlic Sauce.  * What's Wrong Roll (recommended by Chef Michael) made with Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Green Onions, Masago, Spicy Yum Sauce, topped with assorted fish and finished with Screaming Orgasm Sauce.  I could totally put away more food, but I have an appearance to make at Bacchanal the next day and thought I take it easy and just finished the meal with some Fried Banana with Ice Cream (it was a nice finish to the meal, but nothing that blows me away).  Totally satisfied and very impressed with the food we were served tonight.  There seems to be a handful of new sushi restaurants opening in Las Vegas recently, and most have had positive reviews thus far. So if the other freshmen sushi restaurants are as good as Daisho Sushi (which I now easily considered in my top 3 Las Vegas AYCE sushi restaurant list), the rest of the old guards will have good competition to keep everyone on their toes.  That is good news for all the diners out there.  Note:  Aside from AYCE sushi, Daisho also offers a la carte items for lunch and dinner in addition to their lunch and dinner specials.  And dinner starts from 4pm until closing.  Pricing are very competitive for AYCE (especially lunch, which does not seem to have a reduction in the selections available).  About the Chef: (kernels of knowledge gleamed from small talk during our meal) Chef Michael is from New York. His parents own a Japanese Ramen, Yaki-tori (Japanese skewers) and Sushi restaurant there.  So even before moving out to Las Vegas and working as one of the sushi chefs at Blue Ribbon Sushi (inside The Cosmopolitan), he was already familiar with the competitive restaurant business. So finally opening Daisho Sushi here in Las Vegas, just seems like the natural path of progression for this passionate young chef in a new city he now calls home.  (Haha, I sound like his autobiographer).  5 stars!  But as words spread and more and more people learn about Daisho Sushi, and the restaurant undoubtedly gets busier, I hope they can keep up with the projected increased interest in their restaurant and the food they serve.  Good luck Daisho Sushi!!!  And I will definitely be back and bringing friends to tryout the amazing food I had earlier tonight.",

    "text": "So I decided to make Daisho my last sushi spot before I cut back on AYCE sushi meals for awhile D': I've abused this whole all you can eat sushi privilege since I moved to Las Vegas a year ago and it's finally catch up on me. Le sigh.  Anyway, I decided to go with Daisho since it's the new buzzing spot on Yelp and I had to see what all the 5 stars were about.   - Decor -  To start off, the decor is mediocre. Nothing too special, but they have time to improve that later in the future and doesn't really affect my overall experience. The plates they provide are regular large circular ones you would normally find in any other restaurant that isn't serving sushi. Merh, I guess I'm just more used to the traditional small rectangular plates.   - Nigiri -  I can see why the majority of the ratings are 5 stars. The fish is the freshest I have tasted in awhile from the AYCE options. I feel like since sushi restaurants give you the option of eating as much as you can possibly can for a mere ~$25, they can serve not so high quality products. But I must say, the hotate (scallop) was delicious, and the uni was the best I have tasted in Vegas thus far. I've never had so much uni piled on one piece of nigiri. I was actually really shocked on the amount I was given. However, that was the only nigiri where I felt spoiled. Although the fish they serve were all fresh, the slices were really thin. HA! THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU! I knew it was too good to be True :( I guess you really can't have your cake and eat it too, oh what a world.   - Rolls -  Moving on to the rolls for those who don't care much for raw fish. Their rolls are surprisingly the biggest reason I'd come back again and again. AND I NEVER SAY THAT! So good news, they offer half order rolls, bad news is that you have to wait till your 2nd or 3rd round till they allow you that privilege. I love their 'no rice' rolls. Basically everything you would typically have in a roll except instead of being wrapped in seaweed it's wrapped in cucumber, and of course no rice. The one time I actually enjoy a roll, they put a restriction on it and say it's only one per person :( All the other rolls you are welcome to order as much as you like. They have a huge variety of rolls so if you're a roll lover, you've hit the jackpot. One thing I must make note of is that if your go-to roll is the spider roll... order the 'Godzilla Roll'. Their version of the Spider Roll incorporates lettuce (why??). The Godzilla roll is the usual Spider Roll you'd find at any other sushi restaurant.   -Appetizers, other items- Something I really enjoyed about Daisho that really sets it apart from other sushi places is their selection of appetizers. Quail egg wrapped bacon, asparagus wrapped bacon, and mushrooms wrapped bacon! I wasn't very fond of the \"fresh\" oysters since they were warm when they got to our table. There are many other items to make up for it though.  All around, not bad, not bad at all! I'll definitely be taking out-of-town friends here who are more into rolls than nigiri here.",

I've visited 7 or 8 sushi places since I moved here 2 years ago -- at three of them MANY more than once -- and Daisho has already cracked my Top 2. Also, I have not seen a $19.95 price for AYCE Lunch anywhere else in Vegas - and now a sign in the window today promises 50% off rolls and AYCE for their Grand Opening (I did not get any further details as they were not yet open). Given that I work 11pm shifts, \"Lunch\" is my late-night feast :-)  Wherever it's offered, I always start out with an Ahi Poke... If for some odd reason I got to a sushi AYCE and suddenly wanted NO variety, I would just order four or five Ahi Pokes. This one had the perfect boldness and sesame backdrop. I had a few nigiri yellowtail, nigiri salmon, and a wrapped roll with avocado and shrimp. Then I realized that this was an un-planned stop and I shouldn't try to eat what I would when I prepare for an AYCE. So I called it a day.  I can't wait to go back. If you live in the area or are just visiting, you should have it at LEAST once.",
