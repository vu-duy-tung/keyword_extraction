And what more could a girl ask for that 2 women's bathrooms.  They have an Internet jukebox so the music is never dull.  I've never had bad service there and there is always an array of people.  I do adore the food...the ploughman's lunch is my favorite!  Give me wicked cheese and Branston's pickles anytime.  Fries, pasties, sausage roll and even the shrimp is good and the fish and chips EXCEL.  Great conversation seems to flow there.   Cheers!",

    "text": "So I came to this place after reading the reviews here on Yelp and planning an annual trip I make with my father.  I wanted to find some good local places, off the strip, where the food was neither buffet nor over-priced.  Their meat pies were top notch, the cider was fresh, the beer was priced well and they carried a lot of imported foods that are hard to find most places.  Being an off strip place - it seems to cater to locals and I really liked that.  The first waitress was fabulous - fast, attentive and smiley.  The second was very friendly but much slower and less on top of things.  However she was adequate.  The only draw back to this place was how smokey it smelled - but its vegas and the law says you can smoke in the pubs so... This is a place I will definitely frequent again when I am in town.  In terms of being traditional, I am a first generation Canadian, raised by a family of Brits and I can say this is good authentic style pub.  WELL DONE!",

    "text": "ah yes, i think i finally found my watering hole here in the las vegas.  too bad it's too far, but it has the one of the best beer tap selections in town.  i used to come here a long time ago just for the guiness, the boddingtons, and the john courage.  I learned earlier this year that john courage will not be available on tap anywhere in the U.S., so that was a bummer.  I found a great replacement...kronenberg 1664 from france.  i cant get enough of that beer and tetley's too.  this place has good food, too!  it has all those english pub specialties, even indian curry.  go there on mondays to have all you can eat fish and chips.  the fish is fried fresh...so crispy...so hot...and so yummy with malt vinegar.  they have late nite chicken sandwich and cheeseburger specials.  but the thing to get there at any time....is the chicken wing appetizer...whoa man!!!  fu#$in so delicious, my mouth is watering right now.  i dont know what it is, but it has to be that batter...so tasty,crispy,crunchy, and tangy in the dipping sauce.  we always get our grub on and order hella plates of chicken.  this is a must!!!\r finally, they have a special down the hatch club card where for every beer you drink you get a stamp.  when you get to 30 beers, you get a free gift.   so i and a couple of other friends are on a mission to get as many free gifts as we can.   with my first card, i got my crown & anchor down the hatch club t-shirt.  right now i'm working on the jersey.  so, check this place out.  its open 24hours",

I initially ordered the steak and mushroom pie, I had it sent away since they felt the need to only put two pieces of steak in the entire pie. The fish and chips I got instead was so flavorless and overly battered. It was noted by my other companions that it looked like I was eating a baked potato with how much batter I was digging through just to eat some fish. The fries were unseasoned, soggy, not crisp, and straight out of a Ore-Ida bag.  Is salt and pepper illegal in Britain? Since I was with my buddies, I was able to try other things at the table. Nothing was seasoned and didn't have any taste unless it was drowning in their brown gravy or came with a dipping sauce. Out the can peas were on both of my plates. Barely warm, no salt, no pepper, no butter, no olive oil.  After paying 18+ bucks for food and drinks, and being stuck eating mostly french fries and overly battered onion rings, I left knowing I wont be coming back here.",

I ordered the fish and chips, which came with baked beans and \"fresh\" peas, and my friend ordered a lamb stew with yorkshire pudding.  Sounds tasty, huh?  Keep reading...    Well, the fish was NOT seasoned at all.  Although the crust was crunchy, the cod fillet was drenched in grease.  Next, the baked beans were flavorless and obviously canned.  Finally,  my peas tasted like they were once frozen, but they had an old, dry and starchy taste.  They, too were not seasoned at all.  In the end, if you like fried fish, I would recommend FRESHLY prepared Long John SIlvers to this...OR even visiting the \"hole in the wall\" in Northtown called Marios Market (MLK/Lake Mead).  The catfish there is AMAZING and made with love.  Now, my friend ordered the lamb stew prepared in a yorkshire pudding bowl.  Would you believe the stew was NOT lamb, but BEEF (my friend is a trained chef...he knows!)  ANYONE who eats lamb can recognise its distinctive, slightly gamey flavor).   And when it arrived at the table in the yorkshire pudding bowl, the stew was cool inside the bowl...as if the \"chef\" hadn't microwaved it long enough.  Really?!  How long had THAT been sitting around!  Even the yorkshire pudding was soggy and old, like it was made a few days ago.  So, when we informed the waitress that the stew contained beef instead of lamb, she trotted off, frustrated, and returned 15 minutes later and said...\"Yep...the chef says it's lamb.  YOU can SAY it's beef all day long...but I'M TELLING you it's lamb.\"  When I asked her if she had ever eaten lamb before, she responded \"No...I don't like stuff like that.  But the chef told me the stew was made with lamb.\"  Hmmm.  The waitress then grew rude and condescending, as if she was exasperated by our inquiries.  At least she replaced my friend's \"lamb\" stew with a dry, overcooked steak sandwich, which was again unseasoned.  Some \"chef\" they have at the Crown & Anchor, huh?!  What's most disappointing about my experience at the Crown & Anchor British Pub was that I'd been wanting to visit this place for some time now.  I love fish and chips, and I've seen theirs touted as being so delicious.  Hogwash!  They must be paying people to post those comments.  I would NEVER go there again...or recommend any friend to do so either.  It was a 2 on a scale of 1-10.  What a waste of time and money.",

If you want to watch football with real football fans, to hoot and holler, then Crown and Anchor is your place.   They have a ton of European beers on tap, and they serve traditional British and Irish fare on the menu. I like the Chip Butty because, really, where else are you going to get a french fry and butter sandwich? But that's essentially what you have here: a french fry and butter sandwich.   Fans of all clubs can go here and have a good time; it isn't an Arsenal bar or a Man United Bar. It's a football bar. So if you're staying on the strip, take a taxi here and watch some football, whether you're with your mates or by yourself.",

I asked her for a menu, she asked me to wait for just a moment. So I stepped back and waited. But then she started talking to another server, taking her time. So I asked her if I should just ask someone else, since she was busy. She rudely told me that she would get it and acted as if it was a privilege to have her help me out (like why was I even asking her for a menu??? I guess she doesn't consider it part of her job??????) Definitely ruined the night for me. Not coming back. At that point I had already ordered a glass of wine, I gave up on ordering food because I didn't want to give my hard earned money to someone so horrid. We came in with a medium sized group of girls and we were ignored until we flagged a server down. I don't know if Bianca is really her real name or if she gave me a fake name, but she was wearing a red plaid skirt with a black top with black hair. Super skinny, around 5'2. Try to get a different server if you get her. She continued to act as if she was doing me a favor by finally getting me a menu AFTER I told her I wouldn't be needing it anymore (she handed it to me with a \"there, are you happy now?\" kind of attitude). This review is all over the place because of how mad this girl made me. I literally could not stop shaking with how horrid her customer service was. Obviously the manager should either have a more rigorous training/hiring process or learn how to fire employees that hurt your business (as I'm sure I'm not the first one swearing never to return due to her rude ass).  EDIT: Hello Richard, thank you so much for replying, it really does make me feel much better to know that you even bothered to read my review. This situation occurred on December 16, 2015 at around 9:50pm on karaoke night. The server \"Bianca\" was talking to the server with curly copper hair and glasses.",

Honestly, I only got one filet that was a greased up hunk of cod with frozen french fries severed along with frozen rare peas for $13. Then my wife had cottage pie and it tasted like ground beef without seasoning in cheap gravy topped with basic mash potatoes and different well done frozen peas. Honestly the peas were two different colors on our two plates. I would go back to drink but not to eat until they get there stuff together again. I have are there back in the day of the \"best fish and chips in vegas\" and miss that. I talked about it and talked about and got let down. I actually left hungry and unable to eat my wife's entree....

I probably won't order the pie again, but, the potato skins and Scottish egg will be something I will revisit.",

She was extremely friendly and personable. Atmosphere gets an A+. I had the fish and chips as the main course; which was DE. LI. CIOUS. They've definitely done it justice. Here is the bad news... My Yorkshire pudding was burnt. The gravy was tasty but it couldn't mask the taste of char. That lost you a star. The second star disappeared when I wanted to get them to redeem themselves by trying the sticky toffee pudding (one of my favourites.) Unfortunately it was dry and had the same light burnt taste. I'm pretty sure it was old. The ice cream accompanying it was also freezer burnt. Very disappointed...",

I am a chicken finger nut, so hearing that they were good here, got my attention.  We were also going to be watching the US world cup game against Germany, and we found out after the fact that C&A had made the Thrillist list for top 10 places to watch soccer in the US.  While it was a little warm, the atmosphere did not disappoint.  My friends and I sat up a little upstairs nook to watch the game.  We all ordered the chicken fingers before the kitchen closed, as they were grilling burgers for the crowd that day.  The service was pretty good, given the number of people packed in the bar.  We got to try a good mix of beers and had a great time overall.",

I once saw them do a takeout order of 25 orders of fish and chips for some higher roller at Wynn so that means something to me, too.   So that having been said, it's always lots of fun here especially now during the world cup and you can't beat the $20 video poker free lunch special.   Word of warning, they do have a weird alcohol license where you can only have beer at the bar but beer or alcohol in the dining area. So get your seat at the bar and whenever you want a shot, order from the waitress in the dining area.",

The food is good, although they do seem to have issues making a decent custard to go with the sticky toffee pudding (come on how difficult is it to boil a kettle and mix in the custard powder until it's smooooooooth!!!) anyhoo the atmosphere is authentic, right down to the slightly stinky toilets (a staple in any British pub!) and the chalk boards (so you can write humorous japes to your mates!)   The beer is good and plentiful; although they did run out of St George Ale just before St Georges day (that's what i call bad planning!) and the selection covers most of the known world; why they even have some luke warm gnats piss that the yanks know as beer! (Lol I'm gonna get lunched now!! ;p )   The best thing is on Mondays they do ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH AND CHIPS, OK so it doesn't come with mushy peas, but it's a damn good representation of the dish, and they do use cod (none of that haddock b@llocks here my friends.)   The appetisers are a little odd, sausage roll, chip butty and scotch eggs to name a few; for those of you who think this is standard faire will be sadly mistaken. A scotch egg and sausage roll is used for picnicking and the chip butty is a cheap student dinner. A True British appetiser or starter is...prawn cocktail with Marie rose sauce, Heinz cream of tomato soup, stuffed garlic mushrooms and pate on toast (not all together of course!!), the main dishes are more authentic, i can recommend the steak and mushroom pie and the roast dinner on Sundays ONLY!!  There's not much else to say about this place; apart from their world cup coverage was super and they served $4 pints of Stella!!   Wankers away my friends, wankers away!",

And we also had a couple pints, they have 30 draft choices!  The wings and sauce were superb, the wings are battered but its light not overpowering, the sauce is on the side and just how we love it vinegar and spice.  My husband raved about the fish, I didn't try it.  The fries/chips were good, thick cut awesome with malt vinegar.  My big gripe here is that its a bar and I guess in Vegas they still let you smoke, yuck!  Anyways if in the area I would go back again for the awesome wings.   P.S.  We tried the sticky toffee pudding and it was not good, super dry and no ice cream.  If you want one that will knock your socks off try it at Gallagher's restaurant at NY-NY hotel.

    "text": "Arriving here with some friends and relieved I could get off the Strip to some local destinations, I entered a very divey smoke-filled bar. Parking was easy. One portion was a sit down area, while the other area was legitimately a bar with booze, cigarettes, and televisions a plenty.   My friends and I were quickly seated and waited upon by a incredibly friendly staff. Considering it was a Thursday night, we anticipated a heavy college crowd, but were surprised to find it half-full. After a round of drinks, dinner was ordered. My selection was the chicken curry. I ordered as-is and found the dish to be quite kicking. The medium-sized chicken cuts were doused with a thin yellow sauce. The sauce is what made the dish kick. Unable to figure out whether what made it kick outside of any curry taste, I was baffled and prayed that my stomach wouldn't hurt later. It didn't. The dish, while seemingly small for the famished, ended up being very filling. Complemented by chicken tenders, I was very full and quite happy.   Consider this place if you're bored and want to get out of Vegas, and have a dinner with the locals. Without all the shiny, materialistic, commercialized stuff.",

My CO workers and I come here often on Wednesday since they offer a free beer to those in the healthcare industry as long as you come in wearing your work scrubs. They also have a graveyard menu, great for when you had a night out and wish to have a meal before heading home. To top it off the Crown and anchor also has a dog friendly patio which is perfect for breakfast on a Sunday morning.",

As far as a bar goes, it is pretty large and has a quality selection of import brews.  There is a jukebox that has some great music available as well.  Come here if you just want to chill near the strip.  The beers are not cheap by any means ($6-$8), but you can still have a good time nonetheless.    The biggest thing about this bar is that they do not show prices on their beer menu.  This is one of my biggest pet peeves and really irritates me.  None of the beers are over $8 (I believe), but this always grinds my gears when it comes to bars.",

    "text": "I liked this place. We wanted a proper British-style roast dinner for Easter and this fit the bill. We got there just after noon on Sunday and had the place to ourselves (I know, we are bad people to go to a bar on Easter, but it is Vegas, so...).  The food was pretty good, although the lamb was very fatty and the beef was a bit overcooked. The veggies (peas and carrots) were cooked very well. Hot but slightly crunchy - no overbuild mush here. The mashed potatoes were real and the gravy was brown and rich. I question whether we got yorkshire pudding or a popover as it didn't have any beef flavoring, which was expected based on how it should be cooked. Regardless, it was pretty tasty.  I know several reviewers complained about the service, but we had no problem at all. Sure, we were in an empty bar, but I can't discount the service we got because of that. If I had any complaint about the place is that it had a bit of a grimy (not well cleaned) feel to it. Again though, I bet if the other bars we frequented in Vegas were brightly lit I am sure I would have felt the same.   I would certainly come back here again as they had great beers on tap and their prices were great.  Reply to Richard: I am from ND but get to Vegas a few times a year. Next time you can buy me a pint and I will repay the favor.",

However, we visited a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday morning hoping to eat a stunning \"full monty\". Sadly we were disappointed as the server was not only inattentive ( she seemed to be consumed with flirting with a customer at the bar) but when we complained about her poor service she was extremely rude so we decided to leave and eat elsewhere. Sad to see that the standards have dropped so far at a place that I had always held up as a good place to eat. We will not patronize this pub again.",

What a mistake bear in mind it wasn't the servers fault, you could tell he was working beneath his skills at this restaurant. Oh my God my wife is throwing up and I can't stay out of the bathroom. If the cook was standing in front of me I'd punch him in the face myself. Old freezer burnt terrible food was presented to us. The only thing I'm good there was the fish. Nasty condiments that had not been cleaned or replaced in years. My peas we're mix between brown and black and wrinkled like raisins. The salad was by no means fresh. Let me correct myself their iced tea was pretty good. We had no alcoholic beverages. But the fact that my wife threw up at the entry to our home, and that I within an hour of eating I can't stay out of the bathroom. Makes me wonder what else is wrong with the food and or condiments. Stay away just nasty. The owner oughta be ashamed of himself. And the cook I want to meet him or her personally.",

I've tried the scotch egg, sausage roll and fish and chips when I have gone there (3 times, so far), and they are spot on - none of this fake \"We'll CALL it a pub and give the silly Yanks what they *think* is \"British\" food, which is really just American food\" mentality of so many pseudo English/Irish/whateverish \"pubs\" - this is the real deal - or as real as customs will allow.  You must try the fish and chips - get them with mushy peas, because that's good!  The other thing I've loved about this pub is that you never see any kids there - as a child-free person, this is refreshing and so much more enjoyable than wondering if little Bratleigh will yell, scream, cry, run around and basically ruin everyone else's dinner - Bratleigh's somewhere else - GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!!!

They have a variety of beers on tap and after you've had them all (all 30), they'll give you some kind of Crown and Anchor swag.   Thought it was kinda weird that the place was filled with seats. In other cities, a type of bar like this would also double as a club haha. That wouldn't fly in Vegas I suppose.  If you're a local and looking for a chill time with a very young and college scene, come here. No grimy old man pedos.   If you're a tourist and you've ventured this far from the strip, you'll find this place a comforting and unpretentious bar to pass the time.

My husband is of Scottish heritage and wanted to check out British pubs. I found the Crown and Anchor on Tropicana Ave. Reckon we struck solid gold!!!!!!     It was everything we could have wanted from the atmosphere to the pub grub. I had always wanted to try the Yorkshire pudding and was very happy to see it on the menu and with 2 sides of sauces no less! We were so satisfied, we returned again later that week! A regular haunt if we do move there.    The wait staff were fantastically nice and helpful. Our server was Tracy, and she was great! The prices were very good for the quality and portions of the food. We tried many sides, the stuffed potato skins, the fish and chips, the stilton cheese platter, the yorkshire pudding and kept looking at what others around us were ordering.  They have quite a large pub food menu to choose from.    We sat next to four people visiting from England, and they said they loved it and  had been there countless times before, when visiting Las Vegas. It WILL definitely be one of our favorite pub/restaurants in Las Vegas! It being one of two there, can't wait to visit the other one on the west side.",

For a Friday night around 10pm, this place was moderately packed.  Let me start off by saying that THE ONLY REASON I come to Crown & Anchor is because of the Snakebite. I would come here everyday if I could for this  damn drink. I never in my life had liked beer so much until I found this tasty delight. Both locations have darts which is always a fun activity to do with a group of people too. A friend of mine also ordered this dish that included Home Made Potato Chips which were a hit at our table.  I can't say better things about Crown and Anchor. A+ to them.",

While that may be True in the UK, it certainly isn't the case, here.  I don't get over to this place as much as I would like, and that's MY loss, because every time I dine here, I'm never disappointed.  In fact, a fraternal/social group to which I belong, used to meet here every Friday night, about 10+ years ago.  We had most of the upstairs section to ourselves.  I can recommend almost everything on the menu, as at one time or another, I've sampled most of the fare offered.  I treated a total of 5 of my good friends there on June 13, 2012, and the total price for all 6 of us was under $100, so their charges are certainly reasonable.  But best of all, if I may be permtted a totally MALE observation, I definitely noticed the delightfully (and incredibly) SHORT Scottish kilts being worn by the female servers.  No joking guys, they all have LEGS TO DIE FOR.",

They had a lot of comfort food that I remember from my youth.  Couldn't make up my mind on an app so I tried a Sausage roll and a Yorkshire Pudding.  The latter was very dry as if it had been cooked a few days ago and just warmed up.  I had a Blackthorn draft with Blackcurrent (originally asked for Ribena, but waitress had no idea what this was).  Can't remember exactly what my buddy ordered, I think it was some sort of stew.  I went with a Banger buddy (sausage sandwich) with chips.  All in all, not bad.  I wouldn't be rushing back here any time soon.  As a plus we were entertained by the two LVPD police officers who were dining next to us.  It was literally something out of Reno 911 as these two argued over the fact that one of them had never tried clam chowder and the other one was forcing him to sample from the bowl that he had ordered.",

I think to enjoy this place you need to be  A) in college and B) have never been to any other pub. Ever.  First off, I expect a pub to serve more than just beer and wine at the bar. To get hard alcohol (ie. Whiskey in my case) you have to sit in the dining area and order food.  Someone cheaped out on a real liquor license and just doesn't care at this point.  Second, the fish + chips I've tried twice here and its completely lackluster. Not worth the hype. It tastes frozen. The chips were mealy, both times. Very middle of the road. Maybe they had a better chef or food distributor a while back when it got voted #1 in Vegas, but there's far better elsewhere.  The jukebox was a little bit crap too. I heard the Police greatest hits for a little too long. Then it was followed by 1990's euro trash techno. Very blah.  On the upside: great atmosphere, great room, nice pool tables. If you're a major beer drinker, then you'll love it. The whiskey drinker in me was disappointed by their liquor policy.",

Having not grown up in Vegas and my parents moving there 7 years ago when I was 18, I didn't have any friends when I go to visit them until I discovered Crown & Anchor. My first night there I walked in by myself and met some new friends and a few girls and ended up staying until 10AM full of shots. Awesome time every time.

It's a kitschy little bit o'Britain right on Tropicana in the middle of the freaking desert, how can you not like that?  Well, let's just say we stopped by their this afternoon for a wee bit o'food coming back from McCarran and oh my was I disappointed.    Now, there is no doubt they have an excellent selection of draught beers and I quite enjoyed my Belgian wheat beer, but sad to say, the Mrs, had an ice tea and she had to get a Sprite, because the tea tasted like water, yuck!  Anyway on to the food.  Again like another poster mentioned, the fish & chips were just kind of sad.  I mean here we are sitting in the middle of supposedly  Her Majesty's finest establishment expecting British excellence and the fish seemed like something that had been bought at a Costco.    OK, you are right, this is the middle of the Mojave Desert and there ain't no friggin' ocean anywhere near here, but come on, I have had better frozen fish at lots of places that are far from the sea.  Now on to my Ploughman's Lunch.  Oh, how I do like a Ploughman's plate, and to tell the truth they did do a wee bit better here than they do with the fish.  But the bread was dry and almost stale, and  the cheddar cheese tasted like something you'd buy at a supermarket.  Now the Stilton was a nice piece of cheese, though not the best bleu cheese I have had but not the worst either.  The tomato was fresh, but I was a bit expecting the beets to be pickled but they were just cold cooked beat slices.  Service was fine, though nothing spectacular.  The young lass who served us did a good job, but she didn't provide excellent service, it was just kind of a step above adequate.  Again, I really wanted to like the place.  The atmosphere is cool in a corny kind of a way.  I am fond of kitsch, but if you are going for kitsch you also have to provide more than a semi cozy English pub type environment.  You also need to have food that is going to live up to the hype, sadly the Crown & Anchor had the sizzle, but no steak.",

Half the group cancelled their orders , the others starved , decided to wait even longer for food that was mediocre at best , The beer selection was nice and I'm sure we would have spent more ( there were some drinkers in the group that just went to bar for their cocktails ) but with no one coming by often to check for empty cocktails I only had about 2 drinks in about 2 and half hours ( usually could have doubled that , lol ) after leaving there I went to a real bar and was served promptly , all in all though there was nothing here that would make me want to come back !!",

Mind you, it was sometime ago but I pray to the almighty savior of the universe that the bartender who \"assisted\" us no longer works here. Tall, dirty blonde, blue eyed a**hole was our bartender. Didn't catch his name, was literally too shocked to think. Let's just say I've NEVER not tipped EVER. I work in this industry, I know we all live off of tipping but it's called tip service for a reason & there was none to be had here. I grew up in Vegas: I was always taught that if you're a gamer & you're gaming quite a bit at least a few comped drinks (in this case beer cause they don't serve liquor @ the bar) is pretty standard. Nope! Not to tall, dirty blonde, blue eyed a**hole. He told me \"I decide what gets comped!!\" with his finger pointed @ my face after I simply asked why he had charged ME for my best friends drinks when she was playing. My night ended @ PT's sad to say. Never again Crown & Anchor.",

Things that are just ok: The parking situation (not too many spots, especially tight on game day, you usually have to park at the paint store or the llantera and hope you don't get towed). The food (burgers and fish & chips are decent) The prices (reasonable, but I wish happy hour went past 6) The ambiance (pub-ish) The service (sometimes good, sometimes slow)  Thing I hate: The smoking! (yes, they still allow it!)",

    "text": "After hearing all the craze about their fabulous chicken wings, I had to come and try it out for myself!  Lucky me, even though I'm not a beer drinker, my Vegas go to man was willing to drag me along so I can indulge in some much needed deep fried crunch!  I can attest that yes, indeed, these chicken wings and drumettes are big ole things.  There's a lot of batter and meat on these babies, but I couldn't say so much for the taste itself.  Because we were dousing it in ranch dressing and hot sauce, of course it tasted fabulous.  But take away all of that, and I wasn't so sure there was so much flavor in the chicken or batter itself.  Bummer.  They do a fine job though giving it to you on the crispy crunchy end, and we like crispy crunchy things!   They do have a pretty extensive beer on tap selection, which is always impressive.  I'm a pear cider kind of girl for now...  They have various specials from late night craving deals to specialties of the day.  And who doesn't love a place that's open 24 hours?  I'm on a mission to find tastier chicken wings that this!  Bring it!  Update! 10/08/07 - I'm 1/3 of the way through my \"Down The Hatch!\" card!  Yay!  What the heck is that?!  They have this frequent beer drinker card and when you drink 30 of their beers, you get a free gift.  The BF is on card #3 already and is a proud owner of a Crown and Anchor T-shirt and Crown and Anchor soccer shirt.  (I'm hoping for the baby doll tee myself.)  They have some cool bartenders working here and a pool table upstairs as well.  We brought out of town guests and they loved the place!  I think they had live music the past Saturday.  We got there a bit too late and saw them putting their equipment away.  Yay for live music! And there's all you can eat fish and chips on Monday nights and happy hours from 3 pm to 6 pm!  Another cool thing is that they are showing football (soccer) games on the TV, and if you come by really late at night, they'll still have games on!  Sidenote:  They even offer a free shuttle pickup service! Wow!",

    "text": "Crown And Anchor. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...  This place is a unique establishment, which, in Las Vegas, is an achievement. This place has so many draws. For example, the food is absolutely authentic British pub fare. It's the best in town.   The staff. What can I say? From the plaid skirts to the flirty service, the help is definitely easy on the eyes. And ladies, don't despair, because every male bartender is huge ( I believe a prerequisite for male employment is the ability to bench a Volkswagen).   Crown and Anchor issues to its patrons a challenge. Whosoever can drink all 30 beers available on tap will receive a free Crown and Anchor T shirt in commemoration of their drunken prowess. It repeats up to four times for different swag.   And did I mention Pub Quiz?    Once weekly, on Thursday evenings, teams compete in an impossibly difficult trivia challenge, wherein teams are asked ten very difficult questions, spanning a breadth of topics. Thehighest scoring team receives a 50 dollar bar tab to be used at their next visit. It's competitive, free, and a blast. Highly recommended.   So should you ever get the hankering for English culture for a moderate price, a great view, and some stiff competition, the Crown and Anchor Pub is the place to be.",

Let's start with the pasty that one of the diners had. I can't comment truthfully on this because the pasties that I've had all my life living in Michigan are made differently but these were still good. So I'm just partial to the different way of making them.  Have to admit they were large and well-made with a generous amount of mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Forgot to mention we started with a cup of their incredibly delicious creamed cabbage and Stilton soup. Wow!   The rest of us had their much touted fish and chips and that I can tell you I've had many,many times in many,  many places but these were exceptionally good. One very large,  thick piece of perfectly done, fresh Icelandic cod lightly breaded-and one was enough. One diner and I substituted the fries for onion rings which we both loved.  The fish and chips come with a generous portion of peas... Very English indeed. Service was outstanding from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. Our waitress Jessica was not only very friendly and outgoing but treated us like guests in her home.  We definitely will go back and we hope we get Jessica again. I would recommend the Crown and Anchor.",

They have been there several times and could reocmmend things.  For an appetizer, I got a sausage roll, a spiced sausage wrapped and baked in a flaky pastry.  The sausage came sliced and was accompanied by a dish of mustard sauce that was excellent.  It really gave the sausage a nice flavor although it was good without the mustard.  For the mains, all three of us got steak and kidney pie.  This was a first for me and I enjoyed it a lot.  The steak cubes were very tender and the kidney had a very smooth texture and was quite flavorful.  The pie was topped by a flaky crust and it was piping hot.  (Sweeney Todd fans will get that).  With the pie comes mashed potatoes and gravy and a healthy serving of peas.  It turns out to be a large and filling meal.  Service was a little off.  One of my friends ordered water with her drink at the outset and was not brought it until near the end of the meal when she had to ask again.  Also, after being seated, the staff wasn't sure whose table it was until we asked.    I could easily be a fan of the Crown and Anchor but they have to be better with service.",

The waitresses here aren't the most helpful. They don't seem too knowledgeable when it comes to knowing whether or not they have certain brews on draught or if they have ginger beer, etc. They also take too long to ask if you need help. Poor service!!!  There also seemed to be some odd \"rules\" here about where they could and couldn't serve alcoholic beverages. They said it had something to do with their liquor license but it sounded like some BS to us.   Having been the DD, I decided to order a soda. Yuck!!!! The syrup was not only gone but it tasted old and spoiled almost. That was disgusting. I sent that back and just had water.   We threw a few games of cricket and called it quits. The score boards weren't at all in good shape. The boards were super beat up too. The bull line was real worn out. I knew this spot was dicey but this was pretty bad. I doubt I'll be back.",

The restaurant was not overly busy as it was early afternoon but we only saw the waitress three times. We asked for the bill several times and was ignored. We had a game to get to and should not have to wait nearly 20 minutes to get our bill so we could leave. This was our first time eating here and after the horrible service it will be our last.   Per reply from Richard: I wrote this while in the restaurant that afternoon.",

    "text": "Why the 1 star change you ask? Well I received the following message today from Rob the bartender, I've also added a photo just incase he tries to deny the exact verbage:  I really don't appreciate you attacking me personally and using my name in your review! I am not a degenerate and I don't care for your roid rage comment. You see I recognize your picture and I realize that customers get jealous of the way I look and feel the need to knock me with their roid rage comments, but I understand. Maybe the next time we run into each other you can explain the roid rage and degenerate comment! Look forward to seeing you.  WOW talk about customer service at its finest! Now I definitely will not EVER return. And I will make sure I let all of my friends/yelp followers of this experience.   PREVIOUS REVIEW:It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling, slamming the machines, and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you.   So we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together,  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce, then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said \"do you just want to talk to a manager?\" I said no, I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal.   Like I said it pains me to give such a bad review, the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years. But the service just can't be tolerated any longer. I really hope this gets noticed by management because I would hate to see this awesome place go under.",

I enjoy a good beer on tap, or a strong mix drink, but there are many places down Maryland that will offer me that. The food is ok, but nothing to rave about. The fish and chips are a crowd favorite, especially during nights when they do the AYCE. I have tried it once and can only do one plate because it is oil laden. I understand that you cannot expect fried food to be grease free, but a good batter and proper prep should leave you with minimum saturation. The generous pieces of flaky fish are moist and flavorful. After stripping the batter, the meal was more enjoyable. The lightly breaded chicken strips are great since I am not a fan of a thick coating. Nothing kills a good strip more than biting into a strip and getting predominantly breading.  The staff has always been friendly and attentive. Sometimes the male bartender would overlook me for female patrons, but it is not a big deal.",

On my quest to find a cool place to watch the world cup games my co-worker told me about C&A.    My first visit was for the U.S.-England game it was an awesome experience.  Even though the U.S. fans were out numbered a bit we represented.  Besides a couple cheeky remarks everyone got along wonderfully.    Second visit to C&A was for the the U.S.-Algeria game, and unless you are a hermit we all know what happen that game.  Epicness happened.  When Donovan scored that goal it was absolute bedlam.  It is was one of the greatest moments of my life.  What a great feeling to celebrate something like that with your fellow countrymen and women.  But just like the England game all I had was beer.  It wasn't until recently that I had the food.  I was in the area and decided to give the food a try.  And I'm glad I did.  I had the Fish and chips and they were good.  I'm not really a fish guy, but I thought I would have the house specialty.  The truth is I would give this place a four star, but since I experienced one of the greatest thrills of my life it gets a five.  C&A is hand's down the best place in Vegas to watch Soccer and the food is good.",

Deliberately keeping their backs turned to the patrons, avoiding eye contact and all standard gestures that translate to \"I'd like to order a beer.\"  one bartender went so far as to open a drawer, pull out a pencil, step to the side, step back, and put the pencil away just to avoid having to do the five seconds of work it would take to pour me a beer and take my money.

After some time sitting and catching up, I walked up to the bar to place an order for a happy-hour British Burger. After asking me what I wanted, he interrupted me to say \"hold on I got like seven other orders\" and I waited and waited. Finally, he took my order and just seemed annoyed with me. Annoyed when I told him I wanted extra pickles... Annoyed when I told him I wanted cheese. Just annoyed. Clearly Brian wasn't aware that we were... WERE regulars here and have dropped hundreds on a check on any given night multiple times a week. He hasn't payed attention to us since and we have decided to take our business elsewhere!

I didn't mind it, and neither did my boyfriend. We sat down and ordered our drinks and food. My boyfriend mentions how he saw a roach crawling up the stairwell. I got gross out at the thought of it but shrugged it off.   As we continued to wait, I felt something land on my right shoulder and my immediate reaction was to quickly brush it off. I asked my boyfriend if it was a roach and the look on his face answered my question.   The roach fell from the ceiling and landed on my shoulder! Either it came from upstairs or was crawling on the ceiling, I don't know for sure. We moved to a different table and the waitress brought our drinks and asked if we saw another cricket, we told her what happened and she looked horrified. She apologized and told us that they spray the place once every two weeks. I told her it was okay. When she left I saw two more roaches. One crawling on the wall behind my boyfriend and one underneath the table next to us, barely alive.   My boyfriend and I decided to leave, we didn't feel comfortable eating there anymore. We asked if we could just pay for the drinks instead. She understood and asked if we would like our food to go but we said \"No thank you.\" She said we didn't have to pay for the drinks. She was very kind to us.   I suggest you don't come in during summer time.   I'll probably just come here during any other time of the season.",

There were two other people at the bar, after all it was 3 am. The bartender was the rudest jerk I have ever met. He had a British accent and was a bit older. The whole time he looked like an angry mess that was about to blow up on somebody. We had to track him down for water refills and he was so annoyed every time we called him. Dude, if you hate your job so much why are you working in customer service? And to whoever manages this dump you really need to train your employees on how to assist customers with a bit of respect and a damn smile. With so many local bars in Vegas this one is not worth your hard earned money. I get better service at PTs. Never again!",

However, after eating and waiting for the bill to arrive my friends noticed a HUGE cockroach on my shirt that had come out from the dark recesses of under the table to say hello.

Solid breading, but not greasy or overly thick.  Herbs in the breading was unique.  I wasn't crazy about the fries.  They are your basic thick fries.  I doused them in salt, pepper, and vinegar, but that didn't do much.  I just don't like the huge fries, but in a pub that's what they serve so I should get over it.    The chicken tenders live up to the hype, and the bar was fantastic.  I'll be back.",

The place was packed with about 12 Arsenal supporters and about 10-12 West Ham supporters. The bartender was a complete tool and acted like he owned the place. He was obviously messed up on something. It took him forever to get our drinks. When the game started he still had to jukebox playing over the audio system. Several people started asking him to put the game audio on. He kept making that fingers rubbing together money signal like we needed to pay him. Finally I cornered him coming out of the kitchen and asked him to put the audio on. In a quick response he said \"If you pay me.\" I threw $2 at him and said here take it. It then took him 10 minutes to get it working. He's a complete tool and thinks he runs this place. Horrible experience and I doubt I will ever be back. I have watched dozens of matches in the place and it has gone to shit. The problem is all the cabbies drop tourists off at this place and there really isn't another football bar in Vegas that I know of. Super annoying and I am pissed off about the bartender. I have been several other times when he's working and its a complete buzz kill. Its a complete shame because this place could be cool.",

It has character and it is fairly decently priced when it comes to Las Vegas as Vegas is pretty pricey in and around the Strip area, when it comes to food and drink. I have been to the Crown and Anchor Pub twice and I must say that I have enjoyed it both times. I had a beer there that I cannot place but it was bitter yet sweet and all in all terrific. One of the most important things about The Crown and Anchor is that it has an authenticity and feel that is lacking in most Las Vegas establishments. This alone makes it a good place to visit. As an addendum I would like to add that the chips served at The Crown and Anchor Bar are great. Also my friend and couldn't help commenting on the fact that our server was quite attractive. So there is eye candy at The Crown and Anchor as well.",

Unlv students get a burger and a beer for $10 on Tuesdays, or every night after midnight for non-students . This is an awesome deal considering you get a huge burger with bacon, cheese, and a big portion of fries. I'd pay at least $12 for the burger alone, the beer is just icing on the cake.

Honestly, I can't really remember what I have eaten there. My buddy Z loves the Scotch Egg. A hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage. He lives for it!   The real reason we go there. The football. No, not throwball, but the real football. The first experience watching a game there had to be the best. My team lost mind you. Horribly. The atmosphere in the place at 4am was better than any place in the U.S. anytime of day for (insert lame sport here). Chants were being sung. Taunting was taking place from table to table, just before friendly handshakes and rounds being bought for one another. The greatest part of that night/morning had to be at about 7am. We stumbled outside to see the sun up already. Down the parking lot a bit there were 4 British guys. One of which was completely obliterated, yet still felt he could do a jumping spin kick into his friends face. He proceeds to pull down his pants to his knickers. Leaving his black socks on mind you. He lines up his buddy, takes a leap, spins, kicks, misses by a mile and falls on his ass hard. We almost threw up from laughing so hard. Just the thought of this happening again makes us go back.   We will be visiting the Crown and Anchor in 3 weeks time for the Liverpool v. Manchester United match on 3/14. I am sure it will be just as memorable.",

    "text": "In a town full of glitz, glam, and gaming, this is one of the only local pubs that I have found that downplays the gaming and focuses on the pub ambiance.  Of course there is gaming, if you choose, but it's subtle, so the dark, British pub feel comes through without being blinded by lights coming from the screens. They have plenty of beers on tap or in bottles, and offer a full menu worth of food.  The food is British pub style, so don't expect an abundance of spice or anything healthy on the menu, but it is what it is.  I go here for the atmosphere, it's what a great hangout pub should be.  It can get a bit loud when they have their DJ's making it difficult to chat with anyone more than one seat down, but during it's quieter hours (before 10 pm) I think it's the perfect place to have a drink and settle in, maybe play a round of darts or pool with the posse.  Of course, they always have football (soccer) on the tele, so if you're looking for a place to watch the game, you've found it.",

    "text": "This pub is a Vegas classic. I remember my dad telling me stories when he attended UNLV, and now I have found myself creating my own memories here. Don't come for the food, come here for the drinks. They have so many beers on tap, they have made it into a game. If you decide you want to keep coming back (because you won't finish all in one sitting) then ask for a beer card. There are approximately thirty beers on the card, and you get a stamp for every one you try. The only stipulation is that you cannot try a beer twice. It has to be thirty different beers. I made the mistake of mixing light ales with dark lagers with who knows what else one night to try to fill up my card, and it ended in, well, a mess, if you will. Anyway, it is such a fun place to be (we chose Tuesday nights for our weekly get together) and after dining hours settle, it gets a bit louder, and livelier. Crown and Anchor is the best place around UNLV for groups to get together in a casual atmosphere for fun conversations and drinking. Be careful though. You can get tipsy pretty fast, and nobody wants an accident to happen. We always designate a driver (which always seems to be the party pooper since they cant join in on the debauchery, hehe) and the police always seem to be about. Crown and Anchor is so much fun, but have good fun, be safe!  Recommended drink: The beers on the card. Have your server recommend an order, don't just choose or you will end up in the bathroom all night!  Recommended company: Because it is loud and filled with students, I suggest bringing your own group of loud students to add to the mix!",

I'm now working on a script that's like Sideways, but it's in Vegas and the characters are beer instead of wine-obsessed.  It's a buddy pic where friend become enemies, enemies become friends.

He got in our faces and our group almost broke out in a fight! With the bartender!!

I opted for the half and half ( beef and lamb) Lots of English memorabilia on the walls and around. They show all the matches- rugby, cricket, and soccer.  Tourist and locals alike come in. 30 beers on tap and open 24 hours with gaming machines in the bars.  Table seating and big parties accommodated. The toffee pudding was the way to finish.",

The bartenders and servers we have had are all friendly.   Crown & Anchor is located down the street from UNLV. The outside is well lit and easy to find. At the bar, you can only order beer. The pool table and darts are also located on the bar side. But in the separate dining area, you can order food and spirits. This is due to their grandfathered liquor license. Not a big deal for me, but it just sucks when your party is eating in the dining area, everyone has to migrate over to the other side if they want to play darts. They also have karaoke on Wednesday nights. If it wasn't for the place being a little smokey, this would have gotten 5 stars from me.  As for the food, everything we have tried has been delicious. My favorite thing so far has been the fish and chips. The fish is flaky and moist with a nice crunchy breading. The French fries are hot and crispy. And you know how I know the food is good here? I usually hate peas, like literally hate peas. The fish and chips come with a side of peas and they are freaking delicious! They aren't mushy at all. I ate the whole bowl.   If you're looking for a chill place to have drink and eat, you should definitely check it out.",

The environment is very like a traditional British pub, but with waitress rather than bar service. There often seems to be a little less staff than would be ideal, but the waitress who was there worked super hard on my last visit and kept all the balls in the air with only a little delay.  Some of the food is quite authentic (sausage roll, all-day breakfast), and I tend to focus on this. It's quite good at being quite like stuff from England. Especially the bacon and sausage.   Sadly the pies offered are pot-pies rather than having a full-crust. And the chips are frozen rather than fresh cut or even better twice-cooked.  Prices are very reasonable. Environment is friendly. UK sports often showing on tv, but not so loud as to be annoying or stop conversation.   Recommended if British-lover or pinball-lover.",

I don't have to drink beer but I mean fish and chips and Irish pub having beer it only seems right. Also the good thing about is located close to a lot of places so that's pretty cool.

So I decided to give it a try and WOW it was so much fun!! I happened to come on Karaoke night, which I am not usually into, but it was so energetic and full of locals singing and making me feel like one of them. I had some of the best service in a long time. My server, Lynette, was really friendly and provided top notch service. My cup was never empty and I never had to look around for her. She's a mind reader. In addition, the rest of the staff equally was friendly and professional. I've been to London for business and it definitely brought me back! I can't recommend this place enough. Wether your in town for one night or many make it a priority to stop in the Crown and Anchor. I look forward to my next meeting in town.   Blake",

The outdoor patio is really nice and great for pets. Late night, it's a perfect place to sit out and have a few beers in the warm, dark Vegas air.  I often recommend Crown & Anchor to both locals and tourists as a great place to get your night started or as a stop over on your way to a show.  As it is near the strip, be prepared for out of towners who have been hitting it too hard all day and locals who stop in to feel like they are in a Non-Vegas pub. It can get loud and if the wrong people get a hold of the jukebox, you're screwed.",

They do offer a British black taxi to pick you up from your hotel or house. Good parking too. Just watch your back & your wallet going in & out due to the crime ridden area its in.

The bartender not too friendly which by how busy it was you would think he'd be excited to have some visitors.  Anyways, I was suprised to not see alot of people here.  I love the ambiance.  The best part was we moved our little party outside.  The weather was perfect and it sits right along the side of street where you can watch the cars go by.  Little white lights line the patio-super cool.  I love outdoor seating (sigh)-especially when the weather is good.  I do want to come back and try the food.  I also think it is a good spot to have a party...the ambiance is perfect for bringin in a good group of peeps and they have alot of seating.  See ya soon!",

    "text": "As regular (and once happy!) customers of the Crown & Anchor, I thought it would be nice to watch The Grand National over a few pints and some breakfast with my wife who'd never seen the event before and had been looking forward to it for a week prior to the event. We usually visit with friends, family and anybody else we can find to bring along! It's a great atmosphere and worth paying a little extra for the imported draughts! As I'm a British and a US citizen, living in Las Vegas, we thought it would be a nice start to the day as the race started at 8:15am here.  I tried calling the pub three times before arriving to check if you were showing the race on TV, but the telephone went to the answering machine each time. We arrived around 25 minutes before the race and asked a Mexican bartender working there if you would be showing the Grand National. She immediately replied \"Yes, of course!\". Without hesitation, we bought a pint and sat down looking the menu over for some breakfast!  Several minutes passed and all the main televisions were still only displaying the Man U and Newcastle football game. We'd all but missed the pre-race commentary and race line-up, I finally had to asked what time she would be turning the TV over. She said \"I'll change it in just a minute\" and walked away. Five minutes before the race started (and after asking the cleaner/repair chap also because the bartender had disappeared on us), the bartender came over to our table and said \"You wanted the Chelsea game?\". I don't believe for one instant that she comprehended what I had asked before purchasing drinks. I told her that \"we came to see The Grand National\". She seemed confused and asked somebody else working there. Another lady in her early 30s came over and asked what we wanted. When I told her, she said something to the effect of \"I don't understand, what's The Grand National?\" having no idea what we were referring to.  We were very disappointed. Not only did we miss the race (we arrived in plenty of time so that we'd have other options if it was not shown there), but we were lied to. We sat there feeling like idiots with drinks to accompany, quite frankly, nothing! It was also sad to hear that, in a British Pub, none of the workers currently working had any idea what a near two-century-old race even was!! So if you wondered why somebody left full drinks on the table, that was us. As regular customers, I think we will take our patronage elsewhere. I will just have to wait until my bi-annual trip back to the UK to experiences and delights that I am still missing.",

    "text": "I've heard about it for years, but I somehow never made it to the Crown & Anchor British Pub until a couple weeks ago. It's always high on a lot my friend's lists of dive bars along with Frankie's Tiki Room, the Double Down, etc, but those recommendations are typically more for drinks and overall ambiance than food. This is why I was particularly skeptical about this one, even with a few friends swearing by it. Needless to say, I ate it and was more than surprised.  The pub is located on the east side of Tropicana in an iffy area of town, but you're not coming here for the class. The interior is decked out with British-inspired street signs, posters of boats and the like, with the waitresses wearing skimpy kilt outfits. There's also an outdoor patio which I've heard is dog friendly. I was fully expecting an overly loud, smoky bar scene that would have made eating a bit unsavory, but it was surprisingly quiet on the Saturday night we were there. The menu features all sorts of traditional British dishes that I've heard are hard to find at other locations around town. This is all good, but I only really care about burgers for the sake of this review so I'll have to try some of that other wacky stuff on my next visit.  The British Burger on their menu comes with a  1/2 pound patty, bacon, lettuce and tomato and choice of a few cheeses. My burger had great char flavor upon first bite, which carried all the way through. It was cooked a bit more than medium-rare but I was ok with it due to the overall great flavor. It was greasy for the first half, dried up a bit in the second half but was still ok because of the flavor. My bacon wasn't quite as cooked as I would have liked, but it still had decent flavor. The thin onions were good but I still pulled them off as to not overpower the great flavor I was experiencing. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, although the tomato was a little sparse, and the swiss cheese was melted and good as well. The bun was soft, gooey and delicious, and was very well proportioned to meat. Overall this was an excellent burger that I wasn't expecting at all.  While I typically don't care for them, my steak fries were actually really good; they were cooked well for the most part but there were a few soggy ones in there.  My side pickle slices were good too; they never made it onto my burger but I still ate them. At $9.25 with fries this is very reasonably priced; combine that with a beer or three and you're in for a good time. If you're looking for a unique local pub with plenty of drink and food options definitely stop by the Crown & Anchor.",

There is also a steady stream of locals which gives the place a real \"character\".   Over the years, both as a tourist and as a local, the Crown had always been a favorite place to stop in and have a pint. Nothing's changed for many years, even some of the staff seem to hang around for years.  Not every visit to the Crown will give you reason to promote it to a 5 star joint, which is why it sits solidly at 4 stars. The food is good, since you weren't really expecting anything spectacular. The service can be good at times and not so much so at others, but overall you should have fun as long as you let yourself enjoy it.  But if you ever get the chance to make it to the Crown during the World Cup (especially for a match between England and the US like we had just this past summer), you will have definitely have an experience you won't soon forget.   It is events such as this that keeps this place on the list of some of the best places Vegas has to offer.",

It wasn't until my junior year that I went with a few friends to have a drink at this quaint littler tavern, and oh my God was I surprised.  On the outside it seems like a sleepy little pub on the outskirts of London, but on the inside is anything but.  The Establishment is divided into two main sections: a dining room and the bar area.  My friends and I decided to get a bit to eat first and participate in drunken debauchery afterword (Just Kidding (*Wink)).    The dining room had the best of both worlds; the look and feel of an authentic British pub, with four huge Widescreen TVs on each corner of the room, blaring out endless sports center highlights from the day.  The waitresses were dressed in skimpy little outfits and actually knew some of the girls on a personal level from school.  The service was great, but not excellent.  They were very nice to me and my buddies, probably because we were friends, but the service could improve if the hosts and waitresses would treat the other patron with the same level of costumer service.  The best part about his restaurant was the food.  I had Fish and Chips and I have to say that they were the best damn Fish and Chips I have ever had period.  I have been      here many time since then and I swear the food gets better every time.  They also have a huge selection of assorted British beers which I have to admit is pretty damn awesome.  Th food is great, the beer is great, the atmosphere is great, the girls are great, what more could you ask for in a bar?  I rest my case, Go to Crown and Anchor now!",

The drinks are top notch and the food is awesome!  Love us some fish & chips!  Oh the have HP sauce too! Yum!  The outdoor sitting area is a huge plus if your a smoker.  It's very close to the airport and UNLV.  The clientele is diverse as there are tourists, UNLV students and football (soccer) fans.  Epic place to watch Manchester United!!  Make it a point to check this place out on Sunday's as they have a great dinner special.  Bathrooms leave a bit to be desired.  Like that you can open the window to the alley...random but how many allies do we have in Vegas.  Reminds me of back home in NYC.  All in all I highly recommend this bar/restaurant!",

    "text": "Was here last night to meet up with some friends for Monday Night Football and to have a couple of Beers before dinner.  We settled in around the bar and browsed the Beer menu.  There was so many to choose from and I was indecisive, so the waitress said she'd bring me a few samples so I could make up my mind....bonus.    After tasting a few brews, I went for the Fullers ESB.  It's a very good tasting English Ale that was very fulfilling.  Although I've been here many times in the past, I learned something new.....you can't order hard liquor at the bar!  A friend of ours tried to order a Crown and Coke and they said that you had to be in the dining area and had to order food with a hard liquor order.  The reason is that their liquor license is for a Tavern, which means only Beer & Wine at the bar.....hard liquor in the dining room.  That sucked for the people in our group that didn't drink Beer or Wine.  I guess I never knew since I've only ordered Beer when I come here.  Overall, it was a good time for everyone.  Will definitely be back again.",

The waitress did not let us know of the special and by the time we realized the special, she reappeared 5 minutes too late. She was, however, nice.  The place feels overall unclean. The good reviews on the walls from past times only added to my impression that the pub is falling apart.   Ambiance was dive-bar like, and they have spotlights instead of regular lights if you like to constantly feel like you're a stage performer.  To top it off, no hard liquor allowed in the gaming areas.  I just feel like the owner stopped trying. A shame as it has great potential.",

    "text": "The review is for 3.5 stars. I came here a few times when I was in college at UNLV (back in the day, I remember how small it was- small parking lot too- and that it was busting at the seams- another location opened near Chinatown BTW). Our most recent visit was when a good friend was moving to another state- it's her favorite bar. I didn't eat- it was a little too late for me. A couple of our friends did and their food looked good. I did sample a few fries. We had a couple drinks while remembering all the good times. The server was really nice and came around often, checking on us. Since it was wednesday night, it was karaoke night- which made it more fun- it's great hearing people perform- some people are so animated. We hung out for a few hours. There was a good crowd but it wasn't as crowded as it would be on a weekend, I imagine.   I am interested in trying the fish and chips sometime, since I hear that it is a specialty of theirs- being an authentic British pub and all. The atmosphere is rich dark woods and heavy furniture (chairs). It is a little dark inside too.    Just a note, be careful with the step on the way (from the front of the bar to the other side of the bar, on the way to the bathroom, I totally missed it and fell! I was ok, though, just a little embarassed, but not sure many people even noticed it.",

I was unimpressed by the steak and kidney pie, but organ meat is difficult to prepare.  The other dishes at the table were great.  A favorable selection of draft beers was nice, but they were poured in the American style, which takes off points for style. Not a fan of the bar, which has those reprehensible integrated gaming systems, but that is a personal pet-peeve.   All in all, I'd go back with friends if they want a pub night, but not otherwise.",

    "text": "I would like to make this clear from the start, we have eaten here a few times and the food is pretty good, as a Brit living in Vegas there are times I get the craving for some good old British food, today was one of those days.  On one of our trips to the UK I introduce the wife to the British Carvery, to give you an idea take a look here : <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tobycarvery.co.uk%2Fcarvery%2F&s=9c6fb2babb60171edb8c4dccab904bf46d1e93c30760c1bfcbad67d57d5024cc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tobycarvery.co.uk/carvery</a>  Now, as these are non existent in Vegas, we are left with places that serve a traditional British Sunday Dinner, right, Crown and Anchor it is.  The service is always good here, the wait staff are always friendly and quick....... And let's be honest here, whoever came up with their uniforms, you deserve a medal.  But it is the food we are interested in.  The wife went for the Sunday Dinner with roast beef, I had the Sunday dinner with lamb and beef, both dishes are served with Yorkshire pudding, veg and A roast potato (more on those in a minute), along with this my wife ordered a small house salad.  After a while we had pretty much given up on the salad, no big deal, these things do happen. however, when are meals came out, they each had a house salad on the plate, along with the meat, potatoes, veg, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.....  A pet peeve of mine is when waitstaff know that something isn't right, how a house salad, with gravy even makes it out of the kitchen is beyond me (unless this is the way the owners want it, in which case....WOW).  Anyways, a quick recovery by the lady serving us, my salad which I did not order is gone and my wife has a nice house salad on the side, which would have been better served before the meal came out, but ok, on to the meal itself.  Is it a \"traditional British Sunday dinner\", well yeah it is, in the same way that as a McDonald's 1/4 pounder is a gourmet burger, all the pieces are correct, it looks right, but there is just something missing.  So let us dissect the meal :  The meats were good, maybe a little thinly sliced, but that happens to be the way I like them, so I was happy, however, putting beef gravy on to lamb just destroys any taste to the meat, if you are going to offer both meats, it's actually better to serve the gravy on the side and let the customer mess it up.  The Yorkshire pudding was good, this is something that normally causes all kinds of issues to those not raised with the darn things, but they were good.  Veg is veg, enough said and ignored.  Now for the real crime on this dish, the roast potato.....This is going to be long, it is a story and a rant.  The Great British Roast Potato, a food that when done right makes a Brit smile and a non Brit wish they had been born a Brit, sounds like exaggeration huh ?   A couple of years ago we were lucky enough to host the family Christmas dinner here, it seemed like half of California showed up, the women folk worked their wonders on the veg, the father in law worked on turkey and prime rib.  Over in a corner of the kitchen the Brit who married into the family was hiding in a cloud of steam, gently giggling to himself, these poor Americans had no idea what was about to hit them. A bag of potatoes had been boiled, cut in half and were now being gently rocked back and forth in a colander.  The women were looking at the wife wondering, WTF did you go and marry this guy for ? And why won't he answer any questions about what he is cooking ?  45 minutes before we are due to eat, the potatoes are placed in the oven, set at 325, basting in a bath of melted lard and drippings. After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.  So 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !  That is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.  Now the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.  Yes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right. For this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not.",

Got mayo packets in the bag with our meals, nothing out or the ordinary until I spread the mayo all over my sandwich. It spread like peanut butter. Uh oh.. I tasted it with my finger, it was BAD. *barf* Upon closer inspection, it had the consistency of cottage cheese that'd been left out in the sun. Trying not to gag, I brought my food back in. Was offered a replacement, which was acceptable since I was starving. Also was brought a fresh mayo, which I was told had been refrigerated. Why weren't the mayo packets put through the same treatment?? New turkey club wasn't great, I couldn't get the rancid mayo taste out of my mouth. Sorry, not coming back to order food ever again. :/",

The slice of cod is huge and it comes with a side of fries and peas. If you're like me and don't like peas, you can have them get you some extra fries instead at no extra charge. The fish is not overly battered, I love the batter though, so I would love to have more of it, but the fish more than makes up for it.   I've also had their chicken tenders, which is your average chicken tenders, but they're pretty good. They're the typical ones you find in the frozen section of your grocery store. At least to me that's what they taste like.   I always get a pint a beer with whatever I'm ordering, unless it's the middle of the day, but I'm here usually at night.   It's a very friendly environment and they have several draft beers and also some bottled ones. This one is close to UNLV and since I'm always at UNLV this is the place I go to when I want some good dinner and a beer nearby before heading home. It's not quiet or loud, but has this nice vibe to it, at least to me. It is a bit dark inside but it gives you the feeling of a real pub.",

The place looks a little shabby  and dirty on the inside these days.  I went there to watch Spurs give Man U a nice kicking at Old Trafford and was sad to see the state of the place.  Broken chairs, dirty carpets, dust and cobwebs hanging off everything.  Makes you wonder what state the kitchen is in.....  For a bar that shows so much sport I was amazed at the state of the TV's.  Some of them look 20 years old, the quality of the picture on the big screen was absolutely awful.  No HD Box?  Are we living in 1995? It's criminal that any bar showing sports doesn't have good TV's and a HD feed.  You can get 55\" LCD HDTV's these days for $800! I watched the game on a 21\" TV! Just goes to show the owners aren't investing/looking after the property.  The one thing that was a positive was the staff, they were great, especially the french waitress that looked after us (at least I think she was french).  Next time I want to see a game in Vegas I'll head elsewhere, it's just not worth the trip off the Strip these days. The 45 min wait for a taxi when we tried to leave sucked too!!",

Today I went back for the first time in a couple of years and there was a bartender who was INCREDIBLY rude and argumentative. I order a drink and she physically pulled me over to talk about how the drink I ordered was not correct. She was trying to fight with customers and didn't want to hear us out when we said we were used to a different order. If these are the type of people they are hired here now, AVOID this place!",

    "text": "So disappointed in this place. I would give it no stars if I could. It had been a few years since we have been in but we came in for fish and chips remembering they were good. Drove in from Boulder City. This place is dirty, smells, sticky crumby tables and even had a long brown hair in my soda. We honestly should have left but again we remember the fish being tasty. Never ever again Crown and Anchor. Even if the fish is decent the need to run home and shower right away is not worth it. After we ate we ran to Bass Pro Shops and both my husband and had to run to the bathroom before we even were done shopping. The waitress even gave us the wrong bill and there were only 3 tables. Poor service and if you are thinking about this place you may want to go else where. Just my opinion.",

I was very pleased with the service I received at the bar, my glass was never empty the entire 2-3 hours I was there. The bartender even charged my phone behind the counter when it had died!  Food was delicious, I sampled the potato skins and the traditional fish and chips. The ale, Smithwick's, was cold and refreshing as well. Although it's not the biggest bar, it is very cozy and there are lots of TV's around the bar so you can keep up with sports while you hang out. They were about to start Karaoke right before I went home, kinda wish I would have stayed and watched; that would have been entertaining!  All in all, I do plan on returning and frequenting this pub; I really enjoyed the atmosphere at at this place.",

    "text": "This pains me to write this review as I'm English and lived here 7 years with numerous great memories of watching England games with fellow expats here. This is the second time in a couple months I've been to come sit in the beer garden, have a beer and a roast dinner with friends, both being very disappointing. The garden is very dated, has rubbish / fag butts everywhere and had to watch my dog like a hawk to stop him Eating them, the beers were flat and tasted like the lines haven't been cleaned in months, the roast dinners were both probably the worst I've ever had, with a burnt / gooey centred Yorkshire pudding I could use as a weapon and the roast potatoes still hard in the middle (Cleary from frozen, which is fine when cooked properly!) the meat was Ok but a lot to be desired. I know I'm not dining at a Michelin star restaurant but I know the owners are English and I invite them to mystery shop their current chef as I know they'd be livid with what I've been served.   Again I love this pub / atmosphere on big events, but i write this in the hopes that you have a word with the chef / head Barman to solve these issues, as I've spoken with a few other ex regulars who had similar Grievances as myself and don't want to stop Coming here / recommending you guys.  ***In response to reply - thanks for getting back to me, I've attached a photo of my food for you to see that the beer was flat, Yorkshire pudding was pretty burnt and the potatoes were under cooked / hard in the middle. But again I'm sure it's an easy fix, just know as a business owner I'd want to know if my customers weren't receiving a good standard for their money! Cheers Joel",

This pub was a staple when I was in my 20s... we'd drink, eat, throw darts, and enjoy trivia nights here. And the fish and chips were awesome!  Fast forward to many years later, a friend suggested we grab dinner here while killing some time in the neighborhood, waiting to pick our kids up from an event. Of course, I was down to go, and was looking forward to the fish and chips! The pub was very smoky and dingy, the way I remembered it. To me that's part of the atmosphere though... it's a pub! Out of nine of us there that  night, two of us ordered the fish and chips.   Out comes a dish that I didn't quite remember... peas, check. Chips... check. Decent looking fish... NOPE. There was one piece of large, heavily breaded, greasy fish, shaped like a brick. I took a bite, and thought, hmm... I don't know if I should be eating this. I only ended up taking a couple more bites after that, and unfortunately my friend who ordered it as well ate the whole thing.  Fast forward to later that night, we both got violently ill... at almost the exact same time. Everyone else we are with were fine, but the two of us were in for a painful, uncomfortable, sleepless night. Unfortunately, 48 hours later we are both still having gastrointestinal issues (I'll spare you the details), which is making us both nervous. My friend is thinking of calling the county to file a formal complaint.  Bottom line... eat here at your own risk. This definitely isn't the Crown and Anchor it used to be.",

    "text": "A night-time adventure in Vegas. Somehow, glowsticks become involved. Then along comes 5am. Time to find a quick bite to eat and head back to the ranch.   My proximity suggested I pay my first visit to Crown & Anchor on Trop. On the bucket-list since lots of Yelp colleagues have been praising the dining there. If the graveyard cook is on-point, then dinner certainly going to measure up.  I ordered \"the graveyard burger.\" That's just $5.95 for a 8-ounce, cheesed-up, baconed-up, tasting-of-charcoal, juicy piece of meat, with a side of pretty-crispy steak fries. Yeah - this WAS a good idea!   Jason, the bartender attending, offered up intelligent convo before & after my plate. Much more than other graveyard mixologists often muster.  Since I am not big on either drinking or sports, to me this space would be about the food.   But if I urged to tap a Guinness Stout (my beer of choice when I do imbibe) ... here would certainly be a good spot for it.  Only a few stools were being warmed, not surprisingly at this time-of-morning. But, according to Jason, if you want to party with college students at 1am ... or if you want to slip away from the nearby Strip to take in a live Euro soccer game at 7am with your team's jersey & some pub-grub ... this venue also qualifies well.  Me, I'll be back at some point to take in the dinner menu. The burger sold it. And I found out there is an AYCE Fish-n-Chips deal, 5pm-midnight on Mondays.   Ummm. AYCE. My favorite culinary monogram.  Oh, it's a British pub concept throughout. But you already knew that.  UPDATE: I've been back to test the AYCE Fish-n-Chips deal. Not too exciting actually. One plank, then the refills one plank each. Not near as tasty/crispy/greasy as found the Village Pubs. And I've had my fill at Village Pub for $10, less than the AYCE here. But our redhead server Brittany, who went well out of her way to be prompt & conversational, assures I will return, but to test out other sections of the menu.   Tally-Ho!",

In fact it would be fair to say they're better than any fish & chips I've ever had in the UK, they surpass authentic, they are quite simply delicious. The fish is white, thick and flakey and the batter is crispy, melt in the mouth heaven. They do have an extensive menu...& I keep promising myself that I will go back and try the Cornish pasties & the bangers & mash or the steak pie...but so so far I've ordered fish & chips every time (it's that good) I've taken friends back with me and we added the large Yorkshire Pudding as an appetizer & again, you really won't be disappointed. It could seriously have come straight of a pub in my native Yorkshire...expect its huge! Huge and well risen and comes with both gravy and a honey dipping sauce, which I'd never heard of but I googled it and it is actually a thing... The Guinness is served ice cold, the staff are super friendly, inside it feels like a proper English pub (& not an American Sports bar pretending to be an English pub) with wood panels, a suit of amour and English soccer playing on the TV's. That said, I'm usually out on the patio because I take my dogs, there's a grassy area, water bowls are provided and they even have dog biscuits....really, this place couldn't be more accommodating. And it's open 24 hours.",

    "text": "On 02/13/2019, one of my friends and co-workers had a Birthday and myself and 30+ of our friends and co-workers decided to go to Crown and Anchor.   To say that it was a disgraceful experience would be an understatement!   To start off the night, being a Wednesday, we decided to try this establishment because the website says it was industry night and that the first beer is free but the bartender, Troy (I believe that was what we were told his name was) refused to acknowledge that and charged us even after showing him our badges as we were all Strip Casino employees.   Troy was so rude to all of us and kept yelling and screaming at us because we were unaware of the liquor license that separated where we were able to drink hard liquor. Rather than explain it to us, he just kept screaming and yelling to \"get the f*ck out of the bar area\" with our hard liquor.   After I paid for my first beer with A $20 dollar bill, Troy set down my beer and literally threw my change at me. At one point in the night he began to throw the drink menus around the bar because they were in his way and he almost hit someone.  The cocktail server that night was absolutely amazing and very helpful. It was unfortunate to her that Troy acted the way that he did because it made her lose out on tips.   At one point, Troy had made a mistake and brought a second order of chicken fingers to one of our friends, who had already been served the chicken fingers by the server, and Troy blamed our friend, saying to him, \"This is why you need to stay in your f*cking seat!\"   Troy was also very upset that we kept ordering shots of Petrone because he kept having to pour them and apparently that was too much work.   Then later in the night, once the DJ was done playing and after the bartender was done singing a song about how big his testicles were (because that was an appropriate song for him to choose), one of our friends put a $20 bill in the jukebox and began to choose a song to play. At this time, Troy ran from behind the bar yelling at our friend, saying that he's the DJ in the bar and that he chooses the songs. After my friend choose two songs to play, after about 10 seconds of the song playing, Troy skipped both songs. My friend then asked Troy for his $20 back since he was going to keep skipping the songs he plays and Troy replied by telling him to go f*ck himself because he already said that he is the DJ in the bar and he chooses the songs.  At this point my friend asked Troy what is issue was and Troy decided to once again run from behind the bar and get into my friends face and say \"what the f*ck are you going to do about it?\" Troy continued to scream and swear at our group.   At that point we decided it was time for our party of 30 to leave the bar and go down the street to PTs where we knew we would be treated better. Not at any point leading to the time we left, were we ever rude to Troy. We are all grown adults and were trying to enjoy our fiends Birthday and Troy completely ruined it for us.  In the end, not only did that very nice and respectful server lose out on tips, but this establishment lost out on revenue and lost 30+ customers because of Troy's actions.   I have never experienced someone treat people so bad in the service industry like that.",

    "text": "This is definitely the best bar in the area. It has a ton of British charm, European and domestic beers, awesome British food, jukebox, darts, patio, trivia night... What more could you ask for? We usually only come here for trivia night on Thursdays but I've also brought my dog to the patio when it's not too hot out. I always get the Hoegaarden because there aren't many places in town that have it on draft. Chips (french fries) and curry sauce are also a must to snack on. I've had the cornish pastie a few times and it's a delicious and filling meal. I ordered the steak and mushroom pie the last time I was in but I still prefer the cornish pastie. It's wrapped up like a hot pocket vs. inside a deep dish covered in flaky crust. The steak and mushroom pie was a lot runnier and I prefer having flaky crust in every bite vs. more filling.  I've also been to the all you can eat fish and chips on Mondays. They give you a huge piece of fish to start and after that they give you smaller pieces, but it's definitely enough food.    The inside is built like a tavern or wooden cabin. The bar layout is a little strange with a seating area in front of the bar that can only be accessed from one direction. There's a dining room, outdoor patio, and dart area. There are also two staircases that go to upstairs lofts. I've gone up the stairs above the dining room (more dining) but I've never been to the side above the dart area. Are there pool tables up there? I never see anyone up there. So mysterious...   Trivia night is a little deceiving if you've been to any other trivia nights in town. It runs from 9-10 and it consists of only 10 questions. You get a $50 bar tab if you win. It's a casual activity to partake in over a few beers and a late dinner. The one thing that seems to throw everyone off at Crown is that they don't serve shots or any liquor at the bar. The sign on the chalkboard says you must be at a table with food, though the bartenders explain it as you just have to be at a table outside of the bar area and they will bring the liquor over to you.   The Crown and Anchor is a solid bar with friendly staff, great beer selection, and delicious British food. Everyone seems to have a good time and it's not incredibly smoky and antisocial like most every other neighborhood bar. It does seem to attract a lot of foreign tourists which is interesting because it's not super close to the Strip and there aren't other bars in the area to bar hop to. It makes it fun though as you can strike up a conversation with a lot of cool people.",

Other then that I was super satisfied with everything. Good old local spot that is also a cool attraction for visitors. Price were decent and the accents of the servers are on point!  We came over on a late Wednesday night and got seating right away. Walking in a small hallway with then English flag swagging in the entrance instantly transport you to a drunken good time in a pub in England. There is a small bar low ceilings and lots of wood work.  The waitress mostly all wore red plaided skirts. The menu was completely fitting but I don't remember if they offered Beef Wellingtons if so I would've been all over it.  Never the less I had my old English (Old-fashion)and the Scotch Egg aka a hard boiled egg encased in a meat. I ordered it warm but it is also served cold but I'm not sure how that would taste, the server suggested not to order cold unless you actually grew up eating it that way. The egg soaked up all the good flavor of the meat and the ground tender meatball type casing was so good.   The Fish and chips were yummy flaky batter and fries were just thick cut was fresh warm and crispy skin with soft potato inside. The mash and gravy served with the herb chicken was so tasty.   I will be back for sure to try everything else like the flaky crust beef and mushroom pie and lamb stew and Yorkshire pudding omg looks so bomb.   Ok I have to stop cause my mouth is watering right now. Anyway if you haven't been you must try cause you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Talk about the perfect neighborhood pub. This place is an excellent destination for food and having a good time.  All of the menu items are tasty and moderately priced. The fish and chips is fluffy and crusted with a batter that isn't too heavy. Getting a burger with Stilton cheese on it is worth the visit alone. Unless you really like chips(fries) I would recommend the Crown Crisps, they are homemade potato chips and are super addictive.  I had never tried kidneys before, but the steak and kidney pie is delicious. Expect to spend around $30-$40 for two, and a little more if one is drinking.  Speaking of drinking, they have a full bar and 30 beers on tap. Ranging from lagers to IPAs, to the dark beers and even some ciders. About the only thing that would make it better is if they would put Strongbow on draft, currently they only have it in a bottle... which is a vastly subpar way to drink Strongbow.  Service has always been on point every time I've come here. Lesley is one of the best bartenders around, pouring alcohol for all of one's needs. If you choose to dine at a table and are lucky enough to get Catherine as your server, then you'll be getting some of the best service in Vegas.  All in all, I highly recommend this place. I know that I will continue to be giving them my money.",

I didn't hear a lick of British while I was here though. Maybe next time.  Service was unbearably slow, although my friends assured me this usually isn't the case so I'll take their word for it.  For both food and beer, the portions are giant. You definitely get your money's worth. I liked the variety of British food, but just wanted some chicken wings. Like I said, huge portion size and number. I had a good 8-9 wings. I was a little disappointed that the sauce came on the side, although it was just hot sauce (and also ranch).  The crowd was lively for a Thursday night, although the television audio wasn't on (because it was college basketball?)",

The all you can eat English fish & chips (Monday night), chicken curry, chicken & leek pie and Lancashire hot pot are some of my favorite menu items.  Big beer selection and full bar lacking the typical douchebag Vegas tourist is a huge plus.  Most of the out-of-towners are here visiting with a local.   Friendly, prompt waitresses and bartenders do their job well.  Parking can be a bitch at times but that's the only negative that comes to mind.  Oh...that and the mens bathroom sink's water pressure is up pretty high so when you turn it on, you get splashed in the front of your pants making it look like you wee'd on yourself.  Crown & Anchor has done a damn fine job making you feel as if you are in an authentic \"British Pub\"  so much so that you forget you are still in Vegas (which is a good thing.)    Cheers!",

Food server took our drink order & we waited again to give her our food order because she was overwhelmed.  We ordered the beef & mushroom pie, Fish & chips, Chicken cordon Bleu, Potato skins, Chicken wings & A side salad.  The potato skins were tasty but super soft and limp.  The chicken fingers? We didn't order fingers.  WINGS! The pie was delicious but very small, almost like a kids plate for almost $13.00?!?!? The chicken cordon Bleu was dry to the point that my son had to add Tabasco to moisten it.  The fish & chips was ONE giant & tasty piece of fish. The batter got smooshie  under it.  The wings finally came out and they were heavily battered to the point that it hurt to bite through them.  We felt like our food server had no urgency to try and at least give us the proper attention without delay.  We still tipped them 20% no matter what, but we probably not be going back again.  We are being 100% honest & we hope this review helps you guys out.   [like my wife said: \"the food server was probably having a bad night\"] I hope our generosity helped her out :/",

My fish was cooked alright, smallish portions for the price, but not a horrible meal, just a bit overpriced for one serving.  This go around, we ordered the AYCE Fish & Chips and hoped for a filling meal. For over two hours we were at Crown & Anchor, we received our first PIECE of fish, granted, the one piece per plate was fairly substantial. However, it was still just one piece. Shortly after devouring that one piece, my stomach was screaming for more food. It was not until we had been at C&A for over an hour the second piece made its way out. That was it. Two pieces of fish in two hours.   I feel places like this should change the name from \"All You Can Eat\" to \"All We Decide To Serve\".  Also, if you are a bar/restaurant... HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF GLASSES?! The place was not even full and our server apologized multiple times for not being able to bring out drinks in a timely fashion and our friends that wanted a glass of ice to go with their bottled drinks could not have one because, \"We're out of glasses.\" Seriously? There is a serious problem when a bar does not have enough glasses to cover a moderately busy night.",

Tropicana I saw the Crown and Anchor and it looked like just the place.  The ambience is just what you'd expect except for the gambling machines that dominate the bar. Oh well , it is Vegas after all. I was greeted and seated immediately and the service remained very good throughout my meal. The menu looked very tempting and included all of the standard British pub fair. I was very tempted to try the Steak and Mushroom pie, but I was there for the Fish and Chips. The meal came out very quickly and looked delicious. The fish was maybe haddock and was well cooked, moist and flakey. However the batter had a bitter taste; maybe old oil or maybe aluminized baking powder in the batter, which I'm sensitive to. It was  not overwhelming, but enough that I would not order it again. The chips were great (which maybe points to the batter rater than the oil) and the included peas, well they were peas. I gave  them a 3, but if I rated then strictly on this  meal it would have been lower. I do have a feeling a different night or a different entre may have been much better. I may give them another shot next time I am in Vegas, maybe the Steak and Mushroom pie  next time",

    "text": "This is a pretty accurate British pub experience, just a few miles off Strip. I am a real Anglophile, so really enjoyed the decor. The servers and atmosphere are friendly, and the food is authentic England- bangers and mash, mushy peas, kidney pie, Yorkshire pudding, etc. I highly recommend the Stilton and cabbage soup, and my hubby raved about the fish and chips. There is a weird provision in their liquor license which only allows beer and wine at the bar, but they can sell spirits if the customer is seated at the more formal and separate dining area.   The only downside to an otherwise great evening was a bar patron who was very intoxicated- loudly shouting/swearing, starting conversations/arguments with diners, and at one point trying to dance but was barely able to balance and backed into our table- but the bartender continued to serve him. Perhaps he is a regular, he was overly friendly with the young, short-skirt clad waitresses as well. I know customer's behaviors are not the blame of the establishment, but management should have insisted he be cut off.  Loud obnoxious drunk aside, I enjoyed the overall aesthetic and recommend the food. Cheers!",

Eggs were cooked properly, although I wish our plates had been served a little hotter. Overall, another great meal at Crown & Anchor on Trop.

Although it has not been opened for long ( I think I saw something that said 1980s or 90s), it feels like its been around for a very long time.  The dining room is very small and when its at capacity you'll have to wait for a table.  Your best bet is to get a seat at the bar.  At the time of my visit, the waitresses were a bit overwhelmed.  We told the waitress that we'd wait for a table at the bar.  I guess she forgot about us because she sat a party that came though the door before sitting us who were waiting; so, we just opted for sitting at the bar.    The bar tender on the other hand, was super nice.  He ended taking our order and noticing that our food had not come out, compensated our wait with a beer.  Of note is the locals and their understated like for the video poker.  Keep an eye on them, its fun to watch them play.  *bladdered = very drunk **gooner = Arsenal fan (Arsenal is a football team in England)",

This also a good place to grab a drink and hang out with friends. If you are a soccer fan there almost always seems to be a game on.   If you like fish and chips Monday night is your night. It's all you can eat fish and chips. This are also very good.   Last but not least Thursday night at this location is bad singer night. If you like to karoke than this is the place to be. If you like hearing your favorite song ruined also the place to be.   I am a fan of crown and anchor.",

I've watched world cup games here before and the world cup watching atmosphere is great.  Service was excellent and the dining room waitress was attentive.  She was nice enough to switch the TV to another Champions League game for us.  I really like the fish and chips.  The only better version I've had is when I ate lunch by the sea in Ireland at a restaurant that made the fish from the morning's catch.  The chicken fingers are at or near the best I've had for that dish in Las Vegas.  The beer selection is excellent and you can get a lot of english beers that are not readily available at other bars in Las Vegas.  This bar is a great place for on-strip tourists to get a flavor of off-strip and a great place for locals.  May want to pass on this bar if you don't like crowds and it is around world cup time (especially an England game or St. Patricks day).",

Lots of rowdy UK folks shouting for their team when a game is on, having lots of fun. It doesn't hurt that the waitresses are cute and wearing little kilt dresses. (They do that in England, right?) And the food seems real, too, like bangers and mash, lamb stew, and things I've not yet raised the courage to try. It's dark, with a few electrical outlets here and there. They don't mind you camping out getting work done on your laptop as long as you're paying your way. One of my favorite places to get real writing done uninterrupted.

    "text": "It was my first time coming to this pub and I was actually kinda excited since we had just gotten out of a concert and were looking for somewhere to just chat and grab food and a beer. I went in with a group and we ordered our drinks at the bar.   All the seats were full at the bar, but there was no one in the little restaurant area aside from the group outside and a few other people just chatting, not eating at a table not too far from where we decided to sit.  First off, we couldn't find someone to seat us which is why we just decided to find an area ourselves. Trying to get one of the waitresses' attention was another thing as well.  They were darting so fast to the group outside that they completely disregarded us.  Eventually, someone in our group just decided to try to get her attention because she was so flustered at the fact that we had been waiting so long and the only table that appeared to have ordered anything was a group outside.  I ended up ordering the Mozzarella sticks while everyone else got chicken fingers and/or curry.  Our meal took a good while. At least, it felt like it. We burned through so many conversations that I began to wonder if our server had gotten our order out.  She finally came around and brought us our food. Keep in mind that during this whole time, everyone at the table had already gotten through their drinks and she had walked past us quite a handful of times and not once even asked us if we wanted any other drinks.  Mozzarella sticks were the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a>.  The guys liked the chicken fingers, however, the curry order was wrong. It was ordered without chicken but had so much of it that our friend wasn't happy with it at all.  We finished our food (except the curry plate) and still had to wait for our server to even check up on us. The service on a scale of 1-10 was at a 3 for me. I completely understand that she was checking up constantly on the group outside, being that they were a larger group, but if I had known she wouldn't have shown us the same courtesy, I would've opted to go to another pub or bar instead. Treat your customers right. All we wanted was to just be checked up on and offered drinks. It wouldn't have been anything complicated. What's annoying to me is that she preferred to give another group good service, but couldn't even provide us with basic service. How are you so sure we wouldn't have left a great tip for you just for checking up on us as you were darting by? Instead, we were ignored.  The fact that it wasn't even busy, let alone she wasn't the only server there is just the icing on top of it all.  I'm not sure the food is worth coming back for. In all honesty, I'm the type of person who if I go to a cool bar/pub/restaurant/etc. I always share it with people and bring them back with me. My first experience was mediocre. Pretty disappointing. In the meantime, I think I'll have to stick to Gold Spike or Park.",

The potato skins though are pretty good.  They have a wide variety of beers to choose from, as well as hard liquor. However, you have to remember that you cannot order hard liquor at the bar, only beer. I prefer a Smithwicks, but next time I go in, I want to try something different. That is what I like about variety, so many choices, which means so many reasons to go back!   They really do not have a daily happy hour, but they have theme nights. Like Thursday is Pub Quiz, you answer ten questions and the winner wins like a $50 bar tab or something along those lines. Our team did not win last night, bummer. They also have $1 draft Sundays at night.   It is a cool place, nothing extraordinary though. Our waitress was hot, but she was a ditz for sure. She forgot all our orders at one point in time and kept forgetting to place them. I guess it has its days of being cool and  lame. It is also awkward when your philosophy professor just so happens to be getting drunk in the same place you are. Got to love this place for the attraction of UNLV faculty.",

We stopped at Crown & Anchor.  First of all, let me say that I was impressed with the decor.  Being that I have been in London, it was pretty \"accurate\" with the Pub vibe.  Service was A BIT SLOW, and they were NOT that busy.  However, this seems to be a recurring factor in Vegas.  No one seems to move.  Maybe it is just that I am from the NYC area and like things promptly.  We all ordered salads.  The salads, I must say, are pretty dang tasty for rabbit food.  I was really impressed with it.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the english dressing was fantabulous.  Prices were NOT that bad.  I would definitely recommend this place, if you have some time to kill & are NOT in a rush to get in, grab something to eat, and run.",

Service with a flash, but definitely not IN a flash, waiting 5 minutes and still not even taking a drink order?   I'm sure my husband (along with all the others) really don't mind the show, and honestly, I'm not totally offended, its just not necessary. Showing my husband and I your cooch won't get you better tips, wrong venue for this. Even if I had the body for it, I would never be willing to wear their \"uniform\".   I've been here before and noticed the skirts were low, dut I don't remember seeing so much butt flesh. Maybe I just wasn't paying as much attention?  Both the hubs and I ordered the fish and chips. We didn't notice until after our meal that Monday's (when we went) are all you can eat fish and chips. I guess that's why the server asked if we'd like another order of fish, but it wasn't made clear that it was a special. Partly our bad for not checking the specials, but also poor service for not informing your customers of the special.   I wasn't overly impressed. The steak fries were decent, though not cooked enough for me. I like a little bit of crunch in my fries, not a mouth full of mush. I guess they thought they'd make up for it in my fish? My first piece of fish was SOOOOO overcooked that there was no resemblance of actual fish in about half of the piece. All the meat was so crispy, I seriously thought it was all breading - until I took a closer look. I could have complained and asked for another piece of fish... had we had anything that resembled service.   I guess I would probably go back sometime to see if anything has changed (I enjoyed the chicken curry the last time I was there - ages ago)... but it's not high on my list of places to spend my hard earned money.",

    "text": "I made my first, but hopefully not last, stop into the C&A Wednesday week whilst on business in LV.  It can be difficult at times in a big city to find local hangouts, however I fortunately have a UK mate living here who had already sussed the place out and found it up to his British pub standards. Better yet, as I was staying at the Embassy Suites by UNLV I could easily stroll over and avoid driving.  The C&R is basically everything you want in a local pub with an excellent pub atmosphere, a great selection of beers, imported and domestic and a decent pub menu. My friend went for the curry on chips and I played it safe w/ a curry on rice. Although the curry is not quite London or Adelaide fare, none-the-less the dish was more than adequate (I settled for chicken as lamb or seafood were not available), all things considered.   I would also prefer to have optionally mild, medium, hot or flaming arse curries served rather than the rather less than mild version served. Additionally a variety of curries such as seafood, lamb and veggie would be a nice touch.  With UNLV so close by a curry night would not be out of the question. I was present for an Adelaide pub's (The Exeter) introduction of curry night in 2000, c.f. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadelaide.citysearch.com.au%2Frestaurants%2FviewContent%2F1119945819643%2F1137463277210&s=a0288ccde87b61437e0ee3166dd5d6d53b86e0a9e56f526bf703254701106315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">adelaide.citysearch.com....</a>, an event that remains wildly popular to this day.  Not to complain though, all-in-all a great evening of British pints, curry and chit chat. I shall be back.",

It's a nice, relaxing atmosphere, and you can play pool in a quiet second floor game room if you would rather not be at the bar. It does get pretty crowded on weekend evenings, but the service, food, and beer are still good.  They have a sufficient selection of beers with an emphasis on British beers (obviously, considering it's a British pub; however, if you're a beer snob looking for a wider selection of beer and microbrews then you should go to the Freakin' Frog around the corner).   The negatives for this place are that they have a very small parking lot that often can't accommodate all of their guests, and they are right next to a very dangerous intersection: I've witnessed two car accidents in less than half of a year.  Also, there's no easy way to get here without driving.  The whole point of pubs is that you shouldn't have to drive!  The final, fantastic thing about this place is that it's the only pub I know of in Las Vegas where dogs are allowed (on the outdoor patio, of course)!  I have yet to come across any misbehaving dogs - and fingers crossed it stays that way so they don't get banned!",

I think this is a hang out for local residents that are not allowed in casinos.",

It may have something to do with the constant showing of Rugby and Football matches on the flat screens, or it could have something to do with the 50 or so ale's they have on tap each one being a treat or maybe the pretty tasty english fare on the menu.   I pick all of the above.  I have been here so many times the past 14 years and never been disappointed. The beer is good, the food is delicious.  The atmosphere is lively and fun a great local places, a great place to get something on tap that is actually worth drinking!",

They even have this promotion going on where they give you a punch card and you get it punched once for every country you buy a pint from. After 30 punches you get a t-shirt. They neglected to tell me that it needn't be in one night. I am unsure if I got the t-shirt.   I have been here several times other than that faithfull night. I have enjoyed breakfast, simple but solid english breakfast. Lunch and diner were top notch. The bangers and mashare at least as good as my usualpub on Maui.   The kicker is the waitstaff. They always make you feel like a regular. The service at either the tables, the patio, and the bar rivals some of the better establishments on the strip. The naughty schoolgirl thing never hurts either.  Go early in the morning, order a red eye with draught Boddingtons never fails to start the day off right.",

    "text": "First time i have ever done this, but i felt like i had to. I was in town for a week and while here looked online for good places to eat. Crown and Anchor showed up so we decided to give it a try. We came in on Monday night for the all you can eat. First off they need to update their prices online, for the amounts are different. To get on with the story though we walked right in and were able to sit down immediately which was nice. The waitress was at our table within 2 min or so and we ordered beverages and our food right away. My friends water was there within 3-5min or so, my coke however took almost 20 min to show up. After that it took another 20 min for our fish (keep in mind this was AYCE so the fish should be ready quick. After getting our fish, i kid you not it was 40 min before our waitress even stopped back needless to say we had been waiting and trying to ask her for fish for 20min at least. We talk to her and fish is there then somehow within only 5 min. It was then another 20 before we see her again and ask for our check. For anyone that took the time to read this, i really hope that we were an exception and nobody else goes through this. The service as a whole sucked. The people on either side sucked (relationship fighting, and a guy talking in a terrible British accent). In whole dinner took around 2 hours. The reason this even gets 1 star is that yes the Fish and Chips were very authentic. I will not be going back, but if you are willing go ahead and give it a try.",

Toilets could do with a air freshener ( gents) but very friendly atmosphere food and drink great and great price, we are gay and was made to feel welcome, there is Dart boards, TV, Video Poker at the Bar, they do specials all week long, its open 24/7 if your in Las Vegas this is a must come and visit. for British people coming in the USA bar staff and waitresses work for their tips as that is there wage, general rule, when you buy a drink leave a $1 tip per drink, for food leave 20% tip example if your bill is say $50 times the 5 by 2 = $10 there is the tip, if $100 $10-20 if the normal, plus if you like great service next time you go back leave a tip, but the tips is their wage!  we Like this bar and we will be back as we live around the corner. would recommend to every one!",

This is the best Fish&chips you will find in this city, I have been looking for years for this quality of fish&chips. The Fish by the way is HUGE and cooked perfectly.

    "text": "As any soccer fan living in the United States can attest to, being a fan of The Beautiful Game in this country can be quite a lonely experience.  From the quizzical looks I get when I wear my Cesc Fabregas Arsenal jersey in public, to the \"huh?\" I get from bartenders at other bars when I ask if they can put a soccer match on, being a soccer fan is sometimes like being the red-headed stepchild.  Which is why I love this place so much.  Simply put, this is the best British Pub I have ever been to.  It isn't a big bar by most standards, but it's very homely and it just feels warm to be inside.  They have pool, darts and foosball for those interested in bar games.  They do have video poker like in most bars these days, but this is a bar better for socializing or watching a match than playing poker.    I just got back today from watching Arsenal play Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League match, and while the place was pretty empty when I got there 20 minutes before match time, practically all the seats were taken by kickoff.  The British Burger I ordered was absolutely delicious, and next time I must try the fish and chips.  Even though it was noonish, the people watching the match were rowdy and fun, and despite the intensity of a hugely important match were for the most part friendly.  While the fans are passionate and intense, you probably don't have to worry about brawls breaking out.  The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the parking lot of quite small and cramped.  If you're going here to watch a match, be sure to get there early, as it fills pretty fast, particularly if it's a popular club or country playing (I.E. Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal or England's National Team).  Besides, the smaller lot probably encourages designated driving, so you can experience those many beers and get home safely :)  PROS: -Authentic British pub decor -Wide selection of beers  -Plenty of bar games -Great Food! -Soccer, er, Football fans!  CONS: Small, cramped parking lot.",

Walking up to the entrance you see their patio area for pets which I think is a cute idea but then seeing the grass having huge divots and holes with standing water in them going stagnant made me feel like I would never want my dog to visit here. Then came walking inside. We waited to be seated since there is a sign kindly requesting you wait to be helped, well waiting we did, then waiting some more & some more which felt strange since there was only maybe 10 other guests there tops. The hostess was kind, I was surprised to see how hiked up her skirt was but again I thought \"well this is a pub in Las Vegas\" so I wasn't upset. She was kind enough to take our drink orders and return with them a short time later, when she came back she took our meal orders: bangers & mash and fish & chips. We then waited a long time to see the hostess/waitress again it was about 40 minutes for our food, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the food we got back was hot and appetizing. The bangers & beans were Luke warm and the mash was cold with cold gravy where it's more like meat flavored jello than gravy. The fish & chips were okay in the sense that yes it's fried and a huge piece of fish but I wasn't expecting it to be soaked in oil when I received it and the side of peas appeared fine until I watched a small fly crawl out of them and fly away. Trying to make the best of it with my guest we decided to have the food be taken away and we dared enough to try dessert which was probably the only thing we did enjoy. The things I failed to mention through out this review is that while sitting there the entire time we really took in how filthy the place is with holes in the wall, dirty light switches and scuffs everywhere and creaky filthy floors & A LOT of spider webs everywhere A LOT. The tables are spaced out about 2 ft apart which wasn't a big deal, but my prior mention of the hostesses uniform made it uncomfortable when she bent over to fix up the table next to us which was also odd considering the place setting I was seated at was already dirty from someone else eating on it. I think the worst part of all was leaving their one way parking lot and seeing the back door being held wide open with a rope, immediately all of my food handling knowledge & certifications kicked into high gear knowing that open doors are a EXTREME no no because it allows pests of all kinds directly in. All & all its not a place I would go back to and it made me feel awful that I actually invited someone to join me without checking it beforehand, I won't be returning & nothing could make me desire too. So much more happened but I'm done talking about it. I dined in on 10/10/15 around 2:45pm",

Unless you're sitting at the bar gambling, be prepared to wait: wait to order, wait for your drink, wait for your food, and wait for the bill. This last time wasn't so bad, however the time before that we had to wait for our server to finish taking pictures of herself with some other dude that worked there to get our bill. The food and drink is GREAT (scotch egg is top notch and the tender peas served as a side with many dishes a great comfort food to me), but the consistently poor service has finally eclipsed it.

The bar/pub had 7 customers - four at two tables and three at bar.  We waited for five minutes to be seated (per the sign) and when she didn't acknowledge us, I asked if we could grab one of the 8-10 empty tables.  She asked us to wait and went on doing paperwork and tidying up behind the bar.  After another 5 minutes we decided to leave.  C&A needs to talk to their staff or get friendlier people.  I gave two stars because I remember how good the food used to be!",

I used to go to this pub two years ago but when I went about two months back, sad to say the quality of food was a pass! Subpar in taste. I usually have the fish and chips but my friends had ordered other dishes in which they also were unimpressed with or didn't even want to finish. The worst was the Sticky Toffee that was composed of a small dry tasteless muffin with some heated caramel on it. Honestly, I wouldn't waste my time nor money here as I would go to much better places like RiRa at Mandalay Bay or Auld Dubliner at Lake Las Vegas for the best food, drink for the authentic pub experience!",

    "text": "It has been quite awhile since we have eaten here. Even though the food was always good we never liked the fact that they didn't have a True non smoking section. The restaurant is non smoking but is adjacent to a bar where smoking is allowed and there is no separation between the two. If I can smell it and need to shower when I get home than it is not non smoking in my book. That is not my complaint however, I knew what I was getting into there. My complaint is about the service.  We waited a longer than acceptable time to order. We were all pretty hungry and some of us ordered the pies which we are aware take longer than the average entree so we ordered a cup of soup in addition. Our server was either absent or darting by so fast we couldn't get her attention between when we ordered and our food came out. Several of our drinks were dry and those of us who ordered soup were wondering if it had been forgotten. In addition a couple of us wanted to order something from the bar but gave up on that idea. The soup did came out with the entrees and when I commented that I had expected it quite awhile ago the server just said that the kitchen put everything out at one time.  Now I am not naive or self centered enough to think that they made a special pot of soup for me so I am not sure what was so difficult about ladling it into a cup, or more importantly why she didn't check on it when it didn't come up very shortly after the order had been placed. I was not expecting a grand gesture but a simple apology would have sufficed. To add to that our glasses sat empty until my husband stood up and called her back and requested refills.  The food itself was pretty good. The stilton and cabbage soup is excellent and the steak and mushroom pie is very tasty if not a little sparse on filling, especially for the price. The mashed potatoes were the one bleak spot of the dinner, not even warm and hardened as if they had sat out for too long. So overall, pricey for what it is and service seems to be pretty spotty. Not enough to entice me back to contend with the smoking aspect.",

Excellent chicken curry as others have mentioned (if I had to guess I'd say the mushrooms are actually cooked fresh and not just out of a can), let it sit for a bit to cool off, tastes better this way. Bartender, Brian, was great, very attentive to everyone yet made time for some interesting conversation. The GM (friendly British lady) checked on me a few times and seemed to appreciate feedback.

    "text": "I have never been to England to see what a real British Pub is like, but I very much hope it is like this one.  For an appetizer, my party shared a \"Giant Yorkshire Pudding\".  My mother had a British boyfriend when I was young and she made him Yorkshire pudding. This one was better than some I've had, but not as good as \"Mom used to make\". But since those weren't authentically \"Authentic\" it's tough to deduct points for it.  They got cold quick, but that was probably because of the \"Giantness\"   Probably the best Scotch Eggs I've ever had are here. And you can get them cold OR warm (I personally recommend warm).  I also had the Fish and Chips (Since I was going for \"The Classic\" British Style) and they were good.  Just one fish, but it was a pretty big fillet, so no complaints.  We finished it off with Sticky Toffee Pudding which was great!  Through all of this, the ONE waitress kept on top of a pretty busy place.  Considering she was the only one waiting tables her performance was extraordinary. Though as an understandable side effect, service was a bit slow and a member of the party never got the coffee she ordered with the Pudding.  I wish I was in Vegas more often so I could stop in more often. I do hope to come back the next time I'm in town.  One other side note.. They do have a \"Pet Friendly Patio\" so you can bring your pet for a meal outside.  (PS: Due to some drunkenness, I checked in twice.  I've only been here once. The second check in is wishful thinking. Unless it is very far in the future and I've been here more than twice.  In which case, subtract one)",

(ok no I didn't but it adds to the story right?)  The place has a really cool set up, there's a restaurant and bar area, and also a dart board (for the not too rowdy) The bartender Adam (I think?) was really nice and was ready to explain anything on the menu we had questions about. The good service continued the second time I had returned here, the waitresses are friendly and quick with orders.   I'm the type of person that likes to eat a crapton of food while I drink, cause I'm a fat bastard, and the delicious food here is more than enough for me to get my fill. The cottage pie is probably my favorite thing on their menu, along with plenty of Yorkshire pudding and gravy sauce. I'm getting hungry just typing this. I told you I was a fat bastard.",

I just went there and it took me 25 minutes to get my first drink 30 minutes to get my food 20 minutes for each round of beverages and it took me 45 minutes to get my bill at the end , come on...... I think it is because I was not sitting at the bar , I was sitting at one of the few slot machines on the side. Everyone at the bar was getting fast service . The bartenders were either neglecting the waitresses or the waitress that I had just forgot to put in my orders... I dunno!!  Richard it was the same day I arrived there at around 9 PM",

You can even come for an English Breakfast or Sunday Dinner...they will both suffice, but I can't truly rave about either.  And you can certainly come with friends for a good time!  The food is solid (Fish & Chips / Pub Style Curry...and I'll mention the Scotch Egg yet again!) but not worth coming here for by itself.  The Beer is mostly English & Irish Favorites...more than the average pub, but not everything a beer snob is looking for...again not a sole reason for the average Joe to come here.  But when you include the British Pub atmosphere, I'm sold!  I want to be in a place that feels different than average Vegas.  I want to play darts a few times a year...so I will return again and again, have a great time, enjoy some food and beer and remember the special nights when the world just seems more right...and I'll do that here in a heartbeat!   A little more attention to their food and I'd be handing out 5 stars with a smile!",

Only thing stopping me from giving a perfect rating was the condition of the left dart area.  The wall has a hole beneath the dart board and a fellow patron lost a dart through it and was unable to play anymore since there was only one set of darts available.",

They have outside seating for when the weather is warmer. It can get pretty busy here, Especially with the University being so close. The bar area can get pretty packed at certain times. We have always hit it pretty lucky and never had too long of a wait. We highly recommend this place especially if your going to get some British food. Its really good! Worth checking out!!!",

The service is always friendly and fairly attentive. Parking can be tight when it's crowded. The bar area is nice. The restaurant area is ho-hum, but not cramped.  They have karaoke one night of the week, trivia one night of the week, etc. So there's always something going on here. While close to UNLV, it's definitely not too much of a college crowd.  I tend to be here more often for lunch than anything else. Lunch here is fab as it's usually practically empty.  All in all, probably the best British pub in Vegas.",

Steak fries were yummy and they have what tasted like the make it yourself ranch dressing, yum! Peas had no seasoning but not a big deal salt and pepper were right there on the table!

    "text": "A good pub is a wonderful place. Done right, it's a second home for those of us that like to bend an elbow.  Now, Vegas doesn't have a perfect pub.  The main problem in our city is that every pub ruins its ambiance by installing those damn video poker machines in the bar.  And part of the greatness of a pub is a spacious wooden bar (uncluttered by anything except empty pints). So in Vegas, we already start a star down (try resting your elbow on the bar with those blocky video poker machines in the way).  But when you lower the bar for Vegas, Crown & Anchor is an excellent choice.  They have a solid selection of British, Irish and American beers and a decent whiskey collection.  Add in a nice dart board and a solid crowd of good-humored patrons.  Head there for a big soccer match or rugby match and you'll find a nice batch of rowdy fans yelling at a television.  It's comfortable and fun, with tasty fried food and drinks.  What you'd expect from a good pub.  And there are some advantages to drinking in a Vegas pub.  Like all successful Vegas businesses, Crown & Anchor has perfected the art of hiring sexy wait staff.  The staff is very easy on the eyes and a vast improvement from the brown teeth and rolly-polly figure you'd find in jolly ol' England.",

The service is great, Nicole is the hottest waitress in Vegas :) Great beer selection.   If you go I will suggest Wednesdays for karaoke night- half of the singers verge on professional and the other (like me) are pretty bad but always choose good songs.   Thursdays are Pub Quiz nights- although you often have to translate what the quiz reader is asking (very thick British accent) it's a good time and winner gets a $50 bar tab, which, unfortunately, you cannot use the same evening.   TV's are generally tuned into soccer or rugby...I wouldn't know but I hear they get some big crowds at 8AM for important matches.  Interesting liquor license at this place- I mean who wants liquor at a British pub and with their wide variety of beers but if you want a shot you've got to be sitting in the \"restaurant\" not the bar.  Get the chicken fingers they are better than the fish and chips! Open 24 hours this place is the best for after hours! I HEART THE CROWN!",

    "text": "Ugh!  So we had to take a cab to get here because we didn't want to have to trek down Tropicana Avenue ten blocks only to get rolled.  Once we got there we realized something horrifying:  the air conditioner was BARELY on!  Then to make matters even worse NOBODY took our order for a good TEN MINUTES while we sat there (yes, I DID keep track, thank you!)...  So why the HELL would I give such a lame place four stars?  Probably 4.5 to be exact?  Because C&A is just what I miss about London and definitely lived up to high expectations!  Decor is wild.  Definitely reminded me of the drunken stumbles around Notting Hill during World Cup '06.  It felt VERY pub-esque and I loved it so much.  Beer selection is...  eh?  Well let's just say that if you love them English-style beers then you're in heaven.  It was hard to break from the black and tans (especially for hopheads like my brother and myself) so we didn't -- which was fine.  LOTS of weekly specials...  Kind of makes me wish I was either a UNLV student or a casino industry worker.  Or that at least I lived around here to make it out for their occasional food and drink specials.  Or at least to be able to enjoy soccer (sorry, but there is already another sport in this country called 'football' ... TM Justin Timberlake @ the ESPYs) on the numerous TVs.  But the food, jeez, the FOOD!!!  Fish and chips.  Cod was fried EXACTLY the way we love it -- and my bro and I BOTH agreed that it's way better than the Olde Ship's (British pub-ish place here in Orange County) fish.  Thin, crispy outside, flaky yumminess of fish on the inside.  Tartar sauce was perfect.  Fries were perfect.  We chose to throw most of the peas into my chicken curry.  Speaking of which...  chicken curry!  Kind of what I expected -- not spicy, good flavor -- but soooo much food!  I chose to order it on the rice since my brother already had chips.  Good call.  Perfect consistency in the potatoes, LOVED the mushrooms, chunks of chicken were a good size.  It was just SO FILLING!  The night's ultimate experience, however, came in the form of an impromptu \"Today's Special\" dessert:  the sticky toffee pudding was proudly displayed on the night's chalkboard.  Sooo...  what were we to do?  And DEAR GAWD did we make an excellent decision.  The toffee sauce is TO DIE FOR.  I absolutely despise raisins but I stuffed them in my mouth as far as this culinary sinfulness was concerned.  Bread pudding-ish + buttery toffee moat + whipped cream + raisins = one of the most delightful sweets I'd EVER had in my life!  We were so stuffed we couldn't even order another beer.  We were so food comatose that we had to get back to the Tropicana and take a nap before going out for the *night*...  And even though the service was HELLA slow (to use the parlance of our times), and the beer selection is essentially the LAST straw for a hophead, and it took the bar forever to call our return taxi...  I give C&A a proud 4.5 stars, especially since I fell in love with London a couple years ago and this joint is the closest thing to London for me :)",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of C&A, but I have to give it three stars for one major reason--time.  If you are looking to have great  times without dedicating your entire evening to the cause (well, at one place at least!), Crown & Anchor is not for you.  It WILL take you two hours to get three rounds of drinks on a good night.  Err, while I'm at it, I may as well mention parking as well.  I have only lucked out twice with parking at this place, and that was only because I pulled up as someone was pulling out.  On several occasions, my friends and I have parked at Metro across the street or Sherman-Williams and walked over.  Their parking lot is kind of hazardous, anyway.  It's very tight and really difficult to maneuver around in if you get stuck in a sticky place.  But now that I got THAT out of the way (I'm sorry C&A, for I do love you so!), let's get to the goodies.  My friends and I love this place for every reason you could love a pub.  Crown is super cozy and completely raucous at the same time!  When you walk in, you will see people from all walks: older groups enjoy it, the UNLV crowd is pretty big, business people head there after work, and clubbers hit it up for the predancetimebuzz.  Some one mentioned the old wood, and wax, and it takes me back to my Nana Wendy's house.  I sit down and look at the menu and see my family's traditional \"home-cooked\" foods--shepherd's pie, bangers and hash, scotch eggs, cod and chips, curries--for even though I'm from the South, my father and his family are British!  The imported beers list gives a nice sample of the many great UK (and I mean all the countries involved, not just GB) beers, with plenty on tap.  If you're feeling adventurous, the bartender and *some* of the wait staff are very knowledgeable and will happily recommend something to quench what you're thirstin' fer.    If sitting around outside with a smoke, a beer, and a group of friends at a great pub isn't enough excitement for you, inside they have darts, video poker, and several televisions for your pubbing pleasure.  They also frequently host events aimed at the UNLV crowd, like the British Comedy bash, music, and more.  Hello AbFab costume!!",

Martini was delivered with no olives and I caught the waitress and told her no olives.  She returned sometime later with two olives on a pick, and when she put them into the glass, she pulled them off the pick.  Later I told her that in the future when a martini is served, the olives stay in the drink on the pick.  Guess she didn't serve many martinis.  But I digress.  We started with the garlic mushrooms and a Stilton cheese & crackers plate.  The cheese was good, but the mushrooms were so good we were fighting over them.  I could have made a meal just of those mushrooms.  BF had fish & chips, which he said were good, but not the best ever.  I had lamb stew in Yorkshire pudding, which I thought was fabulous.   Very busy place, and service was a little slow, altho lots of people and not enough waitspeople in my opinion.   However, we will be bringing a big crowd of people back here in March to celebrate an early St. Patty's Day!!!!",

That means I'm showing up around 6 in the AM and I probably did not sleep at all the night before.  There's a great beer selection but I can't really comment on the food (although I've been told it's good) because each time I've been there I've been just way too drunk to remember anything except the Scotch Eggs.  And those are perfect for eating after you've downed a few pints.  The last time I was in Vegas we showed up at the C&A so early in the morning it was still dark.  We stayed all day as some lads from England were in town for a stag party (bachelor party to us Yanks) and we ended up drinking with them all day.  The staff was friendly and great fun to chat with the whole time as well (I think we may have even received a couple of free drinks).  By the time we left it was dark again.    We didn't step out into the sun all day and we weren't even in a casino!",

The beer selection is great for me, because I am a big fan of British beers.  This might be the only place in the city that has Bombardier Ale on tap.  The food is very good, and the prices are reasonable.  The problems:   The prices on beer seem to have gone up quite a bit over the last couple of year.  This used to be a good place to come for a couple of $5 drinks, but on the last couple of visits I payed close to $14 for two beers.  Their Happy Hour prices are a little cheaper, but not much.  I really hate to mention this, but there is a roach problem here.  If you sit outside, you're going to see a ton of roaches.  That's not such a big deal, but I have also had the same problem when sitting at the bar.  If you are coming here to eat, I would HIGHLY recommend that you sit at a table in the restaurant part of the room.  I have only eaten food on the bar-top twice, and both times there were roaches crawling around on the condiment bottles and near my food.  The food is really good, though, so I will certainly eat here again, just not at the bar.",

The waitress had no clue to anything soccer related and simply pointed to a schedule chalkboard.  As expected only premeir league games.  What made this especially upsetting was that they were playing a college (american) \"football\" game on one tv.  This place does not play any major league soccer games and instead shows college football!!!! Also, so much for the \"we never miss a game\" I was told in reference to major league soccer.

I thought the avocado was fine, but the bread was a bit dry. I would have preferred less fries and instead maybe a cold slaw side or some salad side accompanying it. 3.0 for the food.  Beer: Both my friend and I had the summer ale. I have to say that it was pretty good. I forgot to ask them if they brewed it themselves, but this pub has an extensive list of beer including imports. The summer ale is a special and it included a dose of citrus. Pretty good light beer. I normally don't drink and even I thought this was refreshing.  Service: Our waitress was very friendly. She also invited my friend and I to the quiz night going on that evening even though we did not go to it. The outfits at this pub are pretty cute- note very short plaided skirts. The food was brought out relatively fast along with the beer.  Parking: Ample parking in a private lot (free).  Payment: Takes credit card.  Location: It's off strip and pretty close to the freeway. One can probably take a cab here or drive here if you have a car.  Overall, the pub was pretty friendly and our waitress was awesome. The food was okay, but the beer made up for it. I also filled out a survey with comments and it will be entered for a $25 gift card to the pub.",

    "text": "Excellent prices and awesome fish n chips! It is located very close to the strip, about five minutes away from the MGM.  We went here on the day of the Queen's Jubilee and they had decorated the place with British flags and pictures of the Queen. Very cool. Best place to go to start out the night. It love how it wasn't rowdy at all and that the service was great. They also have a pool table and darts in the back :) Cool, laid-back atmosphere and good food. What more could you ask for?  If I lived in Vegas, this place would definitely be a staple for me :) I will have to go back the next time I am there!",

    "text": "I generally go the the C&A for the televised football matches (read: soccer games) and from my experience, they generally charge a cover which pisses me off, but I guess it's their right to do so.  I must admit I really do look forward to the chip butty they do (which is basically fries on a buttered roll), great at 6am whilst watching a game!  The rest of the food I've had there is ok, nothing special...haven't tried the fish n chips but as with pretty much anywhere Stateside, the chips aren't 'chip shop' chips, more like 'steak fries'.  The TVs they have for the 'footy' are kinda crap though, especially in the room on the way to the patio, very poor.  Speaking of the patio, I do miss being home in England and having a pint in the sunshine, so this really does hit the spot!  As with a lot of bars in Vegas, I find the service isn't the best, kinda slow as the bar staff of course want to take care of their gaming customers first.  I guess I find it too English at times, especially when there's a big boxing fight in town, it's full of Brits singing shite songs and being obnoxious, something I don't miss about living in England!  All in all, a decent place probably mostly because of the atmosphere and beer selection (the Guinness isn't that great there by the way), but in my mind somewhat over-rated.  Oh, and to Susan R.  it's NOT the same thing as the 'Rose and Crown' you mentioned... that's kind of like saying a Geo Metro is the same as a Cadillac because they're both American cars!",

    "text": "My new favorite spot in Las Vegas. An authentic British pub (well minus the video poker machines) & I used to live England, so I know what I'm on about! If you want a break from the insanity of the Strip, this is the place to chill out. I had their chicken-leek pie & it was wonderful, fresh & flavorful, the best meal I'd had in weeks. The ambience is dark & cozy, the perky co-eds clad in plaid miniskirts waiting on you are top notch. As I'll be moving to Vegas soon, I'm looking forward to many more evenings in my new hang-out.",

    "text": "Sunday was my first visit to big crown. I have been to little crown on spring mt a few times, and never had a bad experience. A couple buddies and me sat at the bar and the bartender came over and informed us that sunday was 1$ PBR night. Well I was looking forward to a Stella or a Bass, but dam, 1 dollar pbr. So I had a couple of those, we also had some of the homemade potato chips and an order of wings.  The potato chips were really thin and broke easily in the curry which could of had a little more flavor.  The wings were decent, kind of your average bar wings. I'd have to give a low rating on the food, but honestly we only tried those two things and nothing off their traditional menu. I will definitely be back to try those becuase the bartender was really nice. He got our orders right, engaged in a bit of small talk, was able to answer questions I had about their happy hour and offered a sample of Bombadier when I asked what kind of beer it was, having never seen it before.   The decor is pretty standard, pictures and UK beer decals. They have a little cove for darts and what sounded like a billards table upstairs. They have a board with all their sports offerings, and special events like karaoke and trivia.  So I will definitely be back for some pints, hopefully of something better next time, but cmon 1 dollar is 1 dollar, amirite?",

    "text": "Strike 1 right off the bat their website homepage says $1 pbrs Sunday night. I order one and they tell me its now $2 and the website hasn't been updated. Strike 2- almost 40 minutes later for my food to come out and I watch as the now off duty bartender gets served his food first, this after he ordered his meal 20 minutes after mine. Strike 3 food arrives and I'm given an excuse that there was a large table that ordered before me; there's only 1 other table ordering food in this whole place. The strike is because of course my meal is cold! The bun was toasted a long time ago and since dried out and the chicken tasted of burnt grill and is dried out. The bartender saw my disgust and offered to refire me a new one. Miraculously a new hot fresh sandwich and fries arrived in under 2 minutes and am told oh yea the cook said your original order may not have been right..... The refire is hot, fresh and tasty but unfortunately my rating still stands because of the 3 strikes. I did get an apology and handshake from the bartender on my way and that speaks for a lot but I can't get over all of the above.",

    "text": "Another bar in Vegas..?  No big deal. The BEST bar in Vegas... Now that's saying something! I learned of the C&A when I lived in Vegas several years ago and it quickly became my \"let's meet here\" place.  They've got a huge selection of beer and cyder on tap.  A great menu, darts and patio dining.  The uni's the waitresses wear are pretty hot too!  But the best part (IMHO) is they play ESPN World on the several TVs scattered around.  Rugby, soccer, Aussie rules football... none of that candy ass baseball they play in most \"sports bars\".  If you go to Vegas, stop in at the C&A, you won't be disappointed",
