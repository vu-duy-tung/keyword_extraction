    "text": "What a disappointment!   I had been to Morels before with parties of 2 and 4 so I thought it would be find for a larger group.  With that in mind, we booked a table on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> for 8 for a 40th birthday dinner at Morels and what was supposed to be a special dinner turned out to be a disaster.    For starters, we were seated in a separate room away from the main room that had zero ambiance and was empty except for us.  This was followed up by what can only be described as slow service with our waiter only passing through once in a blue moon.  At one point, one of our party had to get up to go find water since we were all sitting there with an empty table and nothing to drink.  As for the meal....I'd give a 1.5 stars since one of the steaks was good.  Two of our party had the Porterhouse which was tasty.  It was ordered medium-rare and was cooked well.  Unfortunately, the rest of the meals were sub-standard.  One of the other steaks was also ordered medium rare and was sent back since it was overcooked (it arrived warm/hot pink in the middle).  And then we waited. And waited.  Our waiter showed up (amazing!) and told us it was coming.  And then we waited some more.  Then the manager showed up and told us it was coming.  And then it showed up a minute later.  All said and done, almost 30 minutes passed between when the first steak was sent back and the second one was delivered.    Not only does that make it awkward with the rest of our party eating, it also ruins the ambience of the table and is quite frankly unacceptable.  I wish I could say that they got it right but the second steak was worse than the first one.  It was essentially raw (read: cold and red throughout the steak except the far edges) and could only have been thrown on the grill for 30 - 40 seconds at best.  By this point, we had all finished eating and didn't want to continue the ordeal.    But wait...here's the best part.  They charged us for that steak and when we asked that it be taken off the bill we were told no...your steak was cooked to perfection.   Sorry guys but no it wasn't.  When you can compare one medium rare steak to another one and visibly see the difference, it's not cooked to perfection.  While restaurants define medium rare slightly different, a quick web search of the definition of a medium rare steak shows the following:  \"A medium rare steak should be warm through the middle with a hint of red. Most of the center of the steak should be pink. The sides should be well browned, the top and bottom charred to a dark brown color. This steak should have a firm surface but soft in the middle.\"  It's not supposed to be COLD and RAW in the middle.  Restaurants are about more than the food.  The ambiance, the attentiveness of the servers and the attitude of the management all factor in.     Good customer service means working w/ your customers to resolve a problem when it arises.  For a $60 steak they ruined what should have been a pleasant meal and the manager's behavior was beyond unacceptable.  Their refusal to even discuss the poor service and food left all of us appalled.   Oh yeah, and they don't do anything special for birthdays (like a cake or dessert).    Never. Going. Back.  PS - The rest of the evening went well so that saved the entire night.",

    "text": "Took advantage of the Restaurant Week special with a few buddies. Very nice upscale place on the strip located in the Palazzo. If you get a seat outside and you're lucky enough you can watch the Treasure Island show. Or if you're unlucky enough stay there during a show, all a matter of perspective.  So the meal which was priced at 50.12  Onion Soup Gratinee  - Overall this was the best fancy named french onion soup i've had. It was rich and...soupy...it was good. Normally i don't order french onion soup or onion soup but this was good.   Baby Iceberg Lettuce  - Pretty much a wedge salad with three wedges. Bacon cuts were nice and thick and wonderfully smoked but the blue cheese dressing was way too rich and plentiful.  Mediterranean Branzino  - I did enjoy the sides the came with this Mediterranean SEABASS but for the fish itself...yeah i forgot what seabass tasted like. Way too buttery as well.  Profiteroles   - enough with the fancy names...These are little puff pastries filled with vanilla ice cream and includes chocolate sauce. At this point of the dinner all of us were way too stuffed to even consider dessert but it came out anyway. I enjoyed the ice cream more then the pastry due to my need to live to eat another day.  Morels relies on the older French ideology of cooking which heavily relies on rich and heavy sauces to enhance food. Totally different and may be a bit heavy on you if you're more used to lighter aromatic dishes of today's modern dining experiences.",

We asked to sit outside at a table with four low chairs.  Three in my group are seniors...  We were told that the tables outside were only for dining guests.  Well, guess what??? you nearly did not have any dining guests on Saturday night!  We were shown a high table, around the corner from the patio tables.  Not great for seniors and a less than satisfying view of the strip environs.  We left a bit chafed and found another restaurant glad to take our business.",

    "text": "Great spot for brunch overlooking the strip!  Located in the Palazzo, Morels is classy, but not stuffy, restaurant with great service and really nice outdoor patio.  They have a nice brunch menu, filled with all the normal breakfast foods such as eggs, french toast, eggs benedict, crepes and pancakes.  I wanted something light, so I opted for the Beet and Apple Salad (Candy Beets, Walnuts, Mixed Greens, Humbolt Fog Goat Cheese, Balsamic Vinaigrette, Honey Drizzle)....delicious!  The honey brought out the sweetness of the beets and apples.  For me, the stand out was the Handcrafted Blood Mary, which they made table side.  Fresh horseradish, roasted tomatoes, fresh herbs, Tabasco, fresh ground pepper...equals fresh and delicious! It was really fun watching them make it.  I also tried a bite of the Eggs Norwegian (Sauteed Spinach, Poached Eggs, Toasted Brioche, Hollandaise, Smoked Salmon) which was delightful and surprisingly not that heavy.  I really liked the use of brioche because it was nice and buttery!  Overall, a nice spot to chill with your friends with mimosas or handcrafted bloody marys!  (The artwork inside is racy, sexy and surprising).",

    "text": "I wish that I could tell you how me and two girl friends wound up in this empty restaurant at 10am on New Year's Day. Walking through the Venetian and Palazzo we became very antsy to settle down somewhere as just about every place didn't fit the bill for our brunch cravings. Call it frustration but we ended up settling at Morels and knew that we had made a good decision once our waiter showed up. An older gentleman, he was very entertaining and started joking with us on the spot. We ordered up mimosas and a Bloody Mary that was made on a cart right in front of our table.  For my meal, I went for the Crab Oscar Benedict that lacked a bit of a special kick but I managed to finish every last bite. My friends enjoyed their steak and eggs and turkey club served alongside pommes frites. While it was probably more of an elaborate meal than we needed, it was quite funny to look back on.   I'm sure this place is a bit more crowded at night time when the ambiance provides a elegant backdrop to a night out in Vegas. But I'm almost happy when that we came at a less popular time so that we could take in our waiter's company and cause a bit of a scene without being judged.",

    "text": "I think I may have hit Morels on an off day. It was Saturday brunch, the service was slow from start to finish, and the food was just ok. The whole time I was sitting there I wished I had walked from Palazzo to Venetian to dine at Bouchon instead. So close to a fabulous restaurant (well, a long winding walk through two casinos and an elevator ride), and I went with the more convenient option instead. Oh well, next time I won't make the same mistake.   I did have a seat out on the patio, which was nice on a beautiful March Vegas day, but the view doesn't compare to that of Mon Ami Gabi (the French steak house at the Paris), although it does offer a glimpse of the strip. I had some time, so I didn't mind waiting a long time for my meal, but it took them forever even to bring me my coffee, which I desperately needed, and which ended up being the highlight of the meal: Strong, delicious and French press brewed. They bring complimentary beignets, which is nice, but these were cold, and nothing to write home about. I had the banana and mascarpone stuffed french toast. I think this is a good dish, maybe a touch too sweet for the portion size, but my maple syrup had a firmed up into a film and took away from the overall enjoyment. I do think that the place is probably better overall than it was the day I visited, but I won't rush back here. Next time I'll take the long winding walk to Bouchon instead.",

This made me believe that the sides were of a larger size, due to the insinuation that a family could share them. This is completely False. The sides were of a regular size of sides, if not smaller. In a way, I felt jipped. All in all, Morels was not worth the amount of money that my family and I paid.",

    "text": "Really disappointed.  I came to Morels to have a great steak and was sadly disappointed.  Although the fondue appetizer was excellent, the steak I ordered (a $67 filet minion) came out cold.  Ice cold. Like it was in a refrigerator..... cold.  Weird. When I reordered the steak, it came rare (instead of medium as ordered) 20 minutes later. I just don't understand it.  After two swings and two misses I decided to call it quits and asked for my check rather than wait another 20 minutes for another steak.  To make matters worse, the manager didn't come out to say anything, he left the waiter (from another table) explaining and apologizing to me (my waiter had disappeared). Then, when I specifically requested the manager, I waited almost 15 minutes for him to appear.  I think I have a good idea where the problem is here.  Great product, great servers, but really crappy management.  I'm not sure what to say here because I really wanted to like Morels, but there are two things you must do when charging almost $70 for a steak. It must be hot and it must be the right temperature. Also, in a place like this, if a customer has a problem, the manager should be out immediately solving the issue. Morels misses on both of these points. It's clear to me that this manager was not interested in his customers or his team's performance. Very sadly, I give Morels 1 star and advise them to find new management.  I am sincerely disappointed.",

    "text": "We started off on the wrong foot right off the bat. My husband and I arrived at the host stand and informed the three girls behind the podium that we were there to join them for happy hour and asked if it was available on the patio. The general reception was less than warm and we were told that yes, happy hour was available on the patio and in the bar.   Intending to head out to the patio on a cool November night, I asked if there were heaters and was told, \"uh, yeah, not sure which have propane...\" seeing where this was going I decided just to sit out there. The girl that escorted us back was literally sneering at us and when we got to the patio, she pointed at the first table and said, \"there.\" Not exactly host-like.  Sitting at the high top table, we noticed that there was a serious wobble in the table. So serious that when anyone adjusted in their seat, our waters spilled a bit. We asked our waitress if we could move to one of the many low tables on the patio, and we were told that those are reserved for dinner and that they would be full (later I am assuming) but we could sit inside. I asked if an exception could be made due to the fact that the table was broken and I was told no so we moved inside.   The happy hour is two drinks for one and you can share but only if you are sharing the same thing so no mixing and matching. I ordered the happy hour white and my husband the Kronenbourg. The funny thing about two for one is that it basically takes that price of one drink down to what it would cost in any other city so it isn't really a deal if that is what you are looking for. We however, were not looking for a deal per se; we were looking for cheese.  Reading the reviews, the cheese selection was supposed to be one of the best in Vegas. I am quite the cheese lover and actually know a fair amount about cheese and like to be challenged and try new things. I was expecting a much more robust program including explanations and descriptions. There were none and our waitress didn't seem to know too much except for what was \"good\" which isn't really helpful when describing something as complex as cheese.   Regardless, we got five cheeses and when they didn't have one of the ones we ordered, they gave us an extra one (which was nice-ish since she gave us the one we specifically said we didn't want - weird) and subbed out the one we ordered with another one I didn't want since it is a cheese I get regularly at home. A choice would have been nice.   Ultimately, we had a huge amount of cheese, some booze, and were hanging out in Vegas so we were fine however if I want cheese again, I would head to the Wynn's Le Cave which has less to choose from but a much more knowledgeable and  friendly staff.",

    "text": "My biggest regret of the entire trip to Vegas was walking past CUT, Carnevino, and LAVO to eat at Morel.  I took a gambling and fine dining trip to Vegas with my brother and a close friend, and after a good stretch of gaming we decided to satiate our hunger in one of the fine restaurants around Palazzo.  We walked around, past the restaurants listed above (which are all on the top 40 Vegas list), into Morel.    Truth be told, the main draw that led me into Morel was that the hostesses were very easy on the eyes, so I thought this was the kind of establishment that employed these kinds of people as waiters as well.  Now that I think of it, it was very naive of me, because everyone inside waiting the tables were men.  Respectable and well dressed, but men nonetheless.    At the hour we dined, there was only one other group dining, so they could have put us anywhere in the entire room.  They chose to put us right next to the station that all the waiters were standing by.  They could hear every word we said.  One of us offhandedly mentioned that we could use more bread, and one of the waiters came over to inquire if we needed anything.  While this might sound helpful, it was really nothing more than annoying.  I'm sure you can understand what it feels like to have no privacy when you want to share your opinions of a new restaurant between friends.  The restaurant itself boasts a fantastic view of the strip, and of the T.I. show that's just across the street.  We chose to sit inside because the weather was a little warmer.  The bar area is quite modern, with a couple of flatscreen TVs playing the Celtics game, but the restaurant area boasts nothing.  It didn't make me feel like I was paying $70 for a steak.  Maybe I'm alone in this opinion, but if I'm going to be paying so much for a meal, I want the entire package: good food, good service, good ambience.  The only positive thing I could say about the ambience was that it's quiet, which is doubly annoying if the thing I wanted was privacy (no extra noise to drown out our conversation).  And now, onto the food. Ribeye Steak, $64, medium rare, comes with sauce and no other sides.  Is the concept of having sides (vegetables) along with the entree that foreign in fancy restaurants?  Maybe it's not normal in a French restaurant?  I don't know.  Morel doesn't have sides with your entree.  You can order another side for $9-$12.  We ordered fries (yeah, don't ask why we paid $11 for fries), mac and cheese (we're not the fanciest of people), and this other potato dish.  The potato dish was the best.  The steak itself was the worst cut of ribeye steak I've ever tasted.  The only thing that was good about the steak was that it was medium rare, which surprisingly many places manage to screw up.  The steak was bland, the sauce was tasteless, and even the fatty part of the steak which I usually enjoy regardless of how the rest of the steak tastes was very disappointing.  Worst.  Steak.  Ever.  This also includes the ribeye I got at Chili's.  Yes.  What else can I say about the restaurant?  The waiter didn't seem happy to see that we wanted to move a couple tables away from their immediate zone.  This would be understandable to me, except that with a bill of $240 the tip easily exceeds 4 hours of minimum wage labor.    The toothpick came in an individual wrapper, and that was nice.  Go to Table 10 instead, or splurge and go to CUT.  Save yourself some time and money.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed our dining experience at Morels.  Food was superb.  We had a selection of 5 cheese and had the cheese monger choose for us.  He was right on the money with our cheese preferences.  We also had the foie gras which was also wonderful.  My husband ordered the grass fed NY steak which was seasoned perfectly and cooked to correct temperature, but by far the best of the night was the Braised Short Rib.  It was slow cooked in a sous vide for 18 hours.  It was so tender that a knife was not needed.  Our server Jerry was excellent. Now for the things that bugged me a bit.  They were out of asparagus as a side dish.  Then I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with cashews and they were out of that too.  Really asparagus and cashews?  Probably could have got some at a grocery store near by.  The other thing that is not such a big deal, but seemed weird was that it is a gigantic restaurant and it was almost empty.  When I asked the server about that he said they really only fill up during convention time.  That is such a shame since Morels is such a beautiful restaurant.",

Hostest seated me and my friend very quickly no reservation.As you walk in the dinning room they have a cheese cooler next to the wine cooler. Server was with another table so the sommelier addressed us rather quickly and helped us pick our wines for dinner.Had onion soup as starter it was hot with alot of flavor. I was having the Branzino so he paired Roussette De Savoie which is a dry white from France. It paired well with my Branzino. Pan seared crispy skin rich and creamy mashed potatoes. This was awesome so fare. My  friend had the New York Strip rare with pesto pomme puree. The pomme puree was very good the steak come with a jus over it on a sizzling hot plate all great if you want a medium steak not rare. Meat was not rested either. She had a glass of Dios Triumph which is a Zinfandel dry as well.We added sauteed green beans in foie gras butter shallots, garlic, lemon juice. These where just blanched nothing else no salt or butter. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brulee and Profiteroles. The chocolate sauce for the profiteroles was broken and not a sauce.   Our Server Jerry C was very apologetic all night he removed the green beans from the check. So when I told him about the chocolate sauce his says he will let the chef know. He then come back and say the chef says its supposed to be a thick chocolate sauce. Ok I did not go off on this young man I did point out that as a server look at what the guest is complaining about before you come back with any kind of excuse. Even if you don't cook what sauce comes out in one scoop, does not run, or is separated.",

The bone in rib eye here is really good - it's cooked well - when you ask for medium rare they deliver on that perfectly and it's seasoned well.  In case you get tired of the old salt and pepper flavoring, they offer you three different sauces to dip the steak in.  One is a salsa mix, another is au jus, and the last is ... well, just as delicious.  I've heard recently that it's not as good as it used to be, but I've only got fond memories of this place.  It'll run you about $120 a person if you have a drink and appetizers, which I highly recommend.  Make it a complete meal, it'll be worth it.  I know there's better steak out there, I just haven't found it yet...  The search continues.",

    "text": "Pleasantly average. It's hard to say anything truly bad about Morel's. The service is pleasant, the view of the Strip is serviceable (much better at night because it's right across the pirate show at Treasure Island), and the food very reasonably priced for Palazzo standards (lunch for 2 with 2 drinks each is only 100). The problem is that Morel's does nothing to distinguish itself from the overcrowded bistro market in Vegas. Even in the Palazzo/Venetian it's going up against Bouchon and Pinot Brassiere, not t speak of the other bistros all around the strip (Payard, Mon Ami Gabi.. the list goes on). As a result the restaurant is almost always empty: the last time I was here for brunch there were only 6 more guests in the patio and none inside. For a restaurant that does much OK (service, food, prices) it's hard to write a good review because it is just fine in all categories but superb in none. If you are at the Palazzo for lunch you could certainly do a lot worse but be assured that you could do much better within only a 10 minute walking distance. You won't be disappointed with your meal but you probably won't remember it the next day either.",

I went on a business dinner with 7 associates, and found the steaks to be good, but very pricey, the wine list very overpriced, and the appetizers and add-ons a complete rip off.  But the kicker was we ordered a large lobster  (at nearly $150) for the table to share.  After we'd eaten through a bit of it, we found that one of the claws, about 30% of the overall meat, was totally undercooked - to the point of being raw.  Their flip response - how about we toss that opened claw back on the grill for you.  That's terrible service - and not how you should treat a table that's bringing you a $200 a head spot of business.  There are way better options..",

Three of us had steaks since it is a steakhouse, and they were nothing special in cut, flavor or preparation.  Two were cooked more than requested. I had traditional steak frittes which was ok, but nothing about the frittes were anything to suspect anything but ordinary frozen food (another reviewer raved about the fries. No idea why.). Service was mediocre.  Our lunch was a little later in the day, about 1:30 but with a near empty restaurant you would expect they could pay a little attention and check water occasionally. Also due to lack of attention and time to prepare the meals, lunch was really long, though in defense we didn't complain. Convenient though, since we were staying at the hotel.",

I especially like the fresh baked bread that came with the cheese. Note the uploaded photo so you can see what we tried. From there I went with the 22 ounce dry aged rib eye. When that steak arrived with the sides of green asparagus and pom frites (shoe string fries), I was not disappointed. They cooked the steak perfectly (for me) and I made a valiant effort to conquer the steak. It was the cheeses that undid me. If I just avoided the appetizers (or get a smaller steak!) I would have been able to down everything. I was also thinking that one could theoretically come here just for cheeses and meats!

Had a challenging dinner last night due to busy conference crowd, and the team and management busted their butts to make our night better.  This level of \"make it right\" is one of the reasons we constantly return to Morels.  If there's a big conference in town, call ahead.  We were surprised to learn they don't serve the cheese menu if there are conferences at Sands (not sure how we lucked out on never hitting a conference night there before but glad for that track record).  Sommelier was very attentive.  Server was truly making the best of a situation beyond her control and handled our table with charm and humor.",

The sausage was top notch in spite of the price.  The French Press coffee was the highlight although I prefer it a little hotter.  In all the breakfast was a good experience, but not at top shelf prices.",

Service was meh, we were seated 15 minutes after our reservation which was odd since the place was NOT BUSY and simple things like water and lemons were hard to negotiate. Consistent with other reviews was the sheer lack of options for seafood. But with a good size group, there were plenty of dishes to comment on:  1. Calamari Appetizer: @$24 this plate was small, really small, but there was plenty left on the plate when we were done because it was room temperature, dry, and chewy. We should have sent it back but we were too busy sending back mains... 2. Chicken was served raw, and not \"pink\" or undercooked, it was simply raw in the center. Stomach turning. 3. On the flip side, the grass fed NY strip was ordered medium rare, but came out well-well done.   We ordered several other dishes, but they were totally forgettable.   Memorable comment was:  \"I would send this back if I were at Long John Silver's, but this place won't make it better if they do it again.\"  They knew it was a real mess because we got free dessert; which is a nice gesture, but it would have been better to have a good meal instead.   If someone from the restaurant reads this; it was the evening of May 8th (2017)",

It was around 4pm on a Monday and we were able to go to patio seating easily, though we needed the host to seat us, and they needed to take our name down as a reservation. I got the Grimlet, it was refreshing - came in a glass. I guess I was expecting it to come in a bronze cup thing, though I had seen customers at the next table with one.  My friend had a salad and it was a small portion, but looked delicious, I ordered the calamari, which was $20.00.  It was good, but not spectacular like I had hoped. The server was gracious and so seemed the rest of staff. 2 drinks and two side dishes later, bill came out to be approximately $80.00 (incl. a $15 tip).  So, I'd say it if wasn't for the experience and patio view, I wouldn't spend that much for a restaurant again.",

    "text": "Things you will NOT find at Morel's:  Fresh fruit Seasonings Pristine Service  Things you will find at Morel's:  Overpriced menu items for the quality being served Odd, bumbled service Under-seasoned food  My friend and I decided to do breakfast at Morel's. We have somewhat of a tradition going on of trying new places to eat at. Our most recent jaunts have been to French places. Morel's comes in at our number three experience at a French restaurant on the strip and it is dead last based on service and food.  The reason for two stars has to do with the food primarily. I can overlook poor service if the food is spectacular, but Morel's is putting out average food parading as fresh French cuisine. With so many other better options to eat at on the Strip Morel's should be ashamed at what they are plating.  To begin we ordered the fruit plate. An assortment of tragically cut mediocre fruit is what was served. Blueberries that were not fresh, but looked as though they had been frozen for days. ONE strawberry haphazardly cut, a measly portion of pineapples, cantaloupe and honeydew melon. I could have gotten this assortment of fruit at Denny's, in a bowl, as a side dish, without the $11 price tag. Truly a waste.  I had: Crab Eggs Benedict. While the presentation was perfect the execution was poor. It was plain and simple: BLAND. The crab was tasteless, the bread was decent, the entire dish - didn't seem to be seasoned at all! To add to this, there was no salt or pepper on the table. I realized I should have salted and peppered my dish about halfway through it and at that point I basically said screw it, I'm just going to finish it.  My friend had: Crab Omelet with a side of potatoes, mushrooms, and peppers. This was touted to be amazing by our server.... it was also bland, lacking any real depth or flavor. The dish sorely needed salt, just something to make the potatoes pop. I've had better breakfast potatoes at numerous establishments that could beat these by a long shot. My friend ordered a side of mustard just to give her meal a bit more kick to it.  Costa Rican Pressed Coffee - At $5 for the press this is a bit of a splurge, but honestly the coffee was the best part of my meal.  Service - Our server was nice, but the busser didn't bother to acknowledge our table's presence when we sat down. We were approached by a server who wanted to take our order AFTER we had already put in our order with another server. I mean, stuff like this I might dismiss at other restaurants, but not at a place where I'm paying $11 for a plate of fruit. STEP UP YO GAME MOREL'S.  Overall - I will not return here. There are numerous other places in Las Vegas to find a good breakfast. And honestly if they can't do breakfast right I have very low expectations of their dinner service and quality of steaks.",

    "text": "I was in town visiting and was looking for a fancy romantic restaurant that would have good food and also stay open late. Since we were watching a show that ended at 8:45, we didn't have many options. Plus Morels was also the only place that had absolutely no wait time. In fact, I think I only saw a handful of tables that were occupied, which at first hand doesn't look like a good sign. We look pass that and since my date had never been here either, we decided to stay. The server was very nice and helpful trying to guide us through the menu pointing out the right things to choose from. We ended up splitting a salad and a steak, and also got the mac & Cheese, you can not forget about the mac and cheese. Next time I am in Vegas I will absolutely be back here just for the mac and cheese even if I am not in the mood for a steak. The steak was really good and they even carved it for us. They brought out three different types of salt to rub on the steak but I preferred it without the salt. it didn't really need anything. Just make sure you get it cooked medium. The salad is where I have to knock off a star though. There was three pieces of lettuce and a few very small chopped cucumbers and a couple very very small shrimps in there. Wish I had taken a picture to show the size. For the price of the salad, you'd expect a nice fulfilling salad. I think I will skip it next time and recommend others skipping it as well. Other then that, everything was great, it is a romantic restaurant so definitely a place you would take a date. The prices are on the higher end, but I don't mind spending money on good food and good alcohol. Unfortunately, we had no additional room for any dessert, but maybe next time since The Venetian is my go to hotel to stay at.",

Then came back with another waiter named Jesus. Said he was leaving and Jesus was the best waiter in the restaurant. We gave Jesus our order. Salad and appetizer came....no bread....we asked for some...water glass empty...Jesus said I will be right back with water...15 minutes later we asked the bus boy for water...had to pour our own wine. Entrees came....gummy  fatty short ribs - horrible. Very good Mahi Mahi en cellophane...still no service...about 20 wait staff were standing around talking, restaurant had only 6 tables of diners on a Friday night. No excuse for this horrible service. Any hoo, our first waiter (thought he had to leave) came back to ask how Jesus had done (while I got the check for $185+ for two). I told him this was the absolute worst service I have EVER had in any restaurant in the USA and Europe and NO TIP was coming out of my pocket. I am a very loyal diner which is why I came back to Morels.. What a major and EXPENSIVE disappointment. I would never go back. There are a billion dining opportunities in Las Vegas. THE BEST VALUE IS LUNCH AT THE PALMS IN THE FORUM SHOPS.  Great value $19.50 for huge salad, filet mignon with mushrooms, fresh hot potato chips and hash browns and coffee. Served until 3 pm every day!!",

The place was very empty for 8 pm but that just works for us in better service. The service gets 5 stars. Our waiter was very attentive and patient, answering my numerous questions about their rather large menu. We started with the cheese fondue and it was great. Next, we split the Kansas City steak and lobster special. I thought it was one of the best steaks I've ever had, just perfectly cooked, not fatty, and juicy. The Pommes Frites were solid but nothing special. We ended with the chocolate souffle and it didn't disappoint. With two glasses of red wine, the total was under 200 bucks with 30% tip which is a bargain in my eyes. What kept it from being a 5 star meal was that you could see the Pirate Show at the Treasure Island and that took away from the ambience in my opinion.",

Waiter is OK but not professional, host not friendly at all. We spend $160 for two people. The price you can get much better quality food and excellent service at the other place in Las Vegas.

The environment is spacious and light. The menu is large and diverse, with a great cheese selection as a lot of normal steakhouse fare. Service was attentive and flexible. Great overall environment.  Our food was prepared well, tasted delicious and met our expectations. It was pricey, but not ridiculous.

    "text": "Morel's fronts a lovely elegant setting with an attentive, friendly and efficient wait staff. My rating is based on what came out of the kitchen for our meal. My manhattan cocktail was spectacular! Initially we were served much welcomed dinner rolls. My friends appeared nice and brown on top however the 2 served me were pale and upon eating just were not cooked enough and slightly doughy. Subsequent ones served  to the table were the same as my first ones. I ordered the Pork Milinaise $32 which was listed on the menu as being a panko crusted bone in pork chop. What I was served was a very thin large pork tenderloin \"cutlet\" which was overcooked, burned, to the point of almost impossible to cut and the bite I did manage to cut was cold and dry as a bone. I am not one to frequently send something back but this time I did and the wait person immediately acknowledged the issues and asked if I wanted a different dish. A management person came by and apologized. I then ordered the 18 hour cooked short ribs $39. These came out shortly and were nice enough but not anything to rave about. The meat itself was also a bit overdone and dry even though covered in sauce. The mini carrots on the plate had obviously seen a cooking pan however were room temperature and were rock hard the pearl onions were also undercooked but edible. Our brussel sprouts side was overcooked and had way too much char. The sauteed squash were overcooked and too soft as well, the table finished neither.  I feel as though  for a restaurant of this calibre the wait person should have caught  the major issues with my pork dish and have not even served it. It was in no way as stated on the menu and obviously way over done. The short ribs were ok and decent enough but just that. All of the other items had issues in the cooking that just shouldn't be overall. Thus my rating of 2 stars.",

Needs better management. Server walked by us multiply times and not once asked how our food was.",

I was not disappointed. The G&T Magnifique uses Bombay Blue Sapphire gin but the real trick is an infused ice cube with a sprig of rosemary. The house made tonic is a bit sweet for my taste, but overall, a most delightful cocktail!",

She was really impatient and rude to our group of eight for unknown reasons. Once we were seated, Jerry the weirdo manager came over, introduced himself, and proceeded to lay four copies of his business card on the table. It was really strange and entirely unwanted. Marina was our waitress and she was majorly lacking in the personality department. She was abrasive and just not nice. She also seemed like she couldn't be bothered with our group. Mind you that we were not being loud, unruly, or disrespectful in any way. The prices were pretty outrageous. We paid $60 for a bottle of Malbec and that was cheap based on the cost for any other wine. I ordered the 8 oz filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly. Was it a nearly $60 steak? No. I also had the mushrooms and mashed potatoes and both sides came out cold. To sum it up: the service is poor and the food isn't worth the price.",

Being that I gave up desserts this year, I didn't order from the restaurant week menu as they come with a delicious treat.  I did however enjoy an amazing sandwich that I'm sure I will be back for.    I chose the Croque Monsieur.  A delicious French originated sandwich! They mold this sandwich together with country ham, gruyere cheese & sauce mornay enclosed in sourdough.   Each bite was delectable.  The sauce had a rich flavor which was drizzled over the entire sandwich.  It really takes a grilled cheese to another level.  The service was friendly.  It was somewhat spotty as we waited long periods in between seeing him and also to get our check.  The food certainly out-weighed the service so it wouldn't prevent me from coming again.  I loved the cuisine and dining area.  The elegant and pristine setting would be enjoyed by all.  Merci, beaucoup!",

However, the food was just alright for the price. My boyfriend got the rib eye steak, ordered it medium and got it very rare. When he asked to get the steak recooked, it came back nearly burnt on the outside. My other friend ordered the same thing and got it medium well. For a steakhouse, I would think this should be their best dish. I got the 18 hour braised short rib. Actually, it wasn't that bad at all! The sauce they provide goes really well with the meat, and you get a little bit of a \"side\" with it, so it help take a break from all the meat. The only downside was the meat was a bit on the dry side if I didn't pour the sauce all over it. Luckily they provide extra sauce on the side, just in case.",

The main waiter was obviously overwhelmed and out of his league! With all due respect do was the manager that made a very limited, and in fact weak attempt to compensate for the five (5) dinners that were less than up to par for what a Vegas premier steak house would be proud of! All said and done I give a 1 star review because there was no lesser option. My next Vegas bust WILL NOT include Morels... as I will gladly spend my $$$ at Delmonico's. Needless to say very disappointed this visit... how's the saying go: if I'm happy I'll tell ten people, but if I'm unhappy I'll tell 100 people!",

There was a very nice selection of gourmet cheeses served with bread crostini. The ahi was really delish, a little stack of tuna and served with airy potato chips. We loved everything!

    "text": "We enjoyed a relatively late new year's eve dinner (10:00pm).  The top reasons I made reservations for Morels a couple of weeks before were:  1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.     2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.    3.  STEAK  Our starters were the \"Onion Soup Gratinee\" and the \"Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras\".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.    The foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.    For the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.  The steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.  All in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors.",

We had a beef deep and cob salad.  Both were very nice but by the time you had ice tea, coffee, and tip, lunch is $60.  So a relaxing lunch but not for the budget conscious.  They also have a patio area that looked nice.",

Appetizers arrived and the tower of seafood was amazing....but that's where the evening came off the tracks. A second round of drinks escaped our servers mind, steaks arrived...cold...after more than an hour between courses. The sides were good (asparagus, potatoes and mushrooms) but arrived a full 10 minutes after the cold steaks. The 14oz ribeye had good flavor but wasn't outstanding. Decided to forgo dessert since our \"adventure was pushing 3.75 hours already. All in all service lacks any sense of urgency or timing and food was mediocre.",

My crab Benedict was mostly flavorless and the dry crab tasted more like the sealegs than the real crab and instead of an english muffin, they slapped on a piece of white bread. Over priced. $21 for eggs benedict, $17 for a bloody mary (which was actually the highlight of the meal). Atmosphere: Horrible  oversized picture of sex scenes seem more appropriate in a strip bar than a French Restaurant. I guess they can eek out an existence because they have a rotating customer base to wander in. I can't imagine there is one repeat customer. I know we won't be.",

    "text": "Came here for Three Square Restaurant Week lunch menu on Aug 31, 2011.  Soup of the day was butternut squash soup, it was more black pepper than butternut squash, but texture was good.  The server took it away before I could finish all of it.  The salad was large and dressing was excellent.  The crispy salmon was excellent as the salmon was perfectly cooked with a very light, yet crispy skin.  The salmon was served on a bed of lentils, carrots, and mushrooms, very tasty.  The steak frite was asked to be cooked medium rare, but it came out more medium well on the thin side, and medium on the thicker side.  It was very tender though.  The french fries are excellent!  Light and crispy, my dad couldn't stop eating them.  The strawberry ice cream for dessert was the most flavorful strawberry ice cream I have every had with a wonderful whip cream.    We got there early right before 12 noon and it was pretty empty, the service started out a little slow as we had to wait a couple minutes for the menus and water.  Otherwise, the rest of service was excellent, staff was friendly and prompt.    I would not normally eat here as it is located on the strip, but for Restaurant week, I wanted to give it a try.  I am glad I did.",

But what made our night was the bartenders. Chelsea and Mohammed both talked to us about wine, scotch and food.  I got a nice Yamasaki, which the bartender Mohammed seemed to know a lot about. He spoke to us about the history of and other great recommendations. Then with dinner had a bottle of wine, which the Som recommend, but for the life of me I could not remember the name. Food came out, which was ok, had the petite fillet, which was cooked right. But honestly it's not a Gallagher's steak.  The Brussels sprouts were cooked too much for my taste, then we finished dinner with a nice Suntory Whiskey Toki and good laughs with the bartenders!  Again the bar is where it's at for this place. Would really recommend again if these guys are working!",

When I asked for a clean one the waiter was again rude. When the food arrived(in stages, not all together) it was tasty enough but the pasta shrimp dish had shells on it!!

The service is also good except we never got offered bread to start the meal. Anyway, I hardly judge a restaurant by service or looks alone or what the wait staff did or didn't forget to bring.    The crab benedict was a delight to look at.  The taste was also pretty good.  Fresh crabs, a delightful citrus hollandaise.  However, the poached egg was cooked solid.  The yolk was not running at all, and last time I checked, a perfectly poached egg has runny yolk.  That is a definitely cooking faux pas.  Unforgivable.  Definitely headed to Bouchon instead, next time.",

    "text": "Skip this place at all costs. You've been warned.   It should be a sign that a French steakhouse on the strip is completely empty the majority of the time- because ANYWHERE else would be a better choice.   Over priced for the quality of service, ambience, and food.   Service- HORRIBLE customer service. Just awful. I'm not sure who was our actual waiter because our first waiter made a HUGE, clumsy, rookie mistake (I don't want to go into details about that, because for benefit of the doubt it was a freak accident, not an everyday occurrence) and was swept away before he could even apologize. At least 3 other waiters took his place. Unfortunately quantity didn't equal quality. All lacked professionalism for this being a more \"classy\" restaurant. The real problem though is the manager. The manager of this restaurant needs to take charge, have a mandatory customer service training for his staff, and remember that the customers are important and it is his job to make sure they leave happy, full, and satisfied! The way the \"clumsy mistake\" was handled was NOT okay. Not by a long shot and that was definitely the worst part of the whole dining experience.    Ambience- It was basically empty except one or two other tables. This was 730 on a weekend night. Besides the actual restaurant, the bathrooms looked like they haven't been remodeled since before the Palazzo was built, and the soap used to wash your hands is the same kind you get at the dollar store, Softsoap, and it was obvious water had been added to it to make it last longer.    Food- food was just okay. Not bad, but not something worth going back for. There are better steaks that are cooked how you ordered them, all over the strip. The tartare was served with what looked and tasted like ruffles potato chips. Sauces and salts were brought to the table without an explanation of which was which.   If you want a \"fancy\" meal on the strip, or are craving a good steak, don't just settle for this place because of convenience or short wait time! There's a reason! You will be disappointed.    As a side note, we were given a name and email by the Palazzo to express our experience at Morels, whom we emailed within an hour of our meal. It's been over 72 hours and we still have not received a response.",

Being this is the Palazzo, you know the first two are going to be top notch so I really want to give props to our waiter, Brandon. (Tall one with the beard, I'm told there are three.) The Wife and I are on our honeymoon and stopped in for a quick lunch, and right off the bat, he gave us the business for our Red Sox hats (Guess I wont hold his being a Yankee fan against him. Nobody's perfect!) and knew pretty quick this guy was going to clique with us.  The Wife ordered the Croque monsieur and I ordered the French dip and of course a few drinks. Both were excellent! Just the right meal at the right time for the fun we were having in 110 degree Vegas heat, Not too heavy, just right.  So Brandon brings me a sample of the house brewed pilsner, which was very tasty, and for a bit we chat him up and get the run down on what a local would do and see when in Vegas, talk Bout baseball, home and long and short, he made the meal, had some good advice  and it was one of those experiences your going to tell your friends about when you go back home.

It was just mediocre and nothing more.  The hostess greets us nicely and confirm our reservations with 5 tables and made recommendations which I appreciate. We were all seated and our orders were all taken the same time. Altho the hostess were friendly, the waiters could have been more organize and communicate with each other and their tables. By the end of the night 4 out of 5 tables were served. Our friends at the 5th table did not get their dinner at all. The waiters did not want to take ownership at first. They blame the other waiters and the other blame the cooks and for a good 10min came with a conclusion that our friends at the 5th table should just pay for what they consume. One of our friend was so upset he put down his money for the dinner he did not receive and walked out while our couple friends did not agree and ask for a manger to make it right. After another 10min they finally made it right.  As for the food, I ordered the short ribs and it was above average but I enjoy the mushrooms and free complimentary bread more. My bf ordered the NY steak and did enjoy it but made a remark about for the price it was it should have came with sides. We both agree this would be a one time experience and would not come back again.  I would have rated it a two star but I gaved it a three because of the friendly hostess and the manager finally making it right for our friends at table 5.",

The beet salad was very bland and nothing special about it. Once the main course arrived I had the 14 oz.

Dessert was very good, done table side Chocolate mouse.",

The onion soup is amazing and so are the crepes. Honestly, the size of those suckers was tremendous! You would think they would skimp out because its a 'high-end vegas restaurant' but not at all! For the price, you definitely get enough food to keep you pleasantly full. The staff was very prompt and friendly but then again I've only been here for brunch and have yet to experience dinner. I know there are some negative reviews about the staff but I have yet to experience that... I guess til' next time Morel's!   Brunch - A-Ok Dinner - To be continued...",

Had the scallops as a starter. Very nicely done. Had the tomohawk rib eye and lobster surf-n-turf.  Very nice presentation. Lobster was excellent. Rib eye tasted kind of bland for what I paid.  Than they forgot about us. Requested support from other staff members but because we weren't their customer, they didn't care.  In order to get a 5 they need to finish what they started with good service and improve the taste of the steak. This dinner was too expensive for what I paid for.",

The only negative was due to our server, he was rude and spoke to us like we were somewhat stupid. We had asked him as to what champagnes he had per glass to which he responded \"the ones that are on the menu\" we asked for his suggestion - we preferred something a bit more dry , he responded that he said that all the champagnes were dry and the same. I don't understand why work in such an upscale place if you choose to not interact with clients or care to suggest. Disappointing.",

We had a party of 6 and were initially seated at a table, which was only inches away from other tables on all sides. One of my colleagues said it felt like a cafeteria setting, and I couldn't have agreed more. In addition, the chair coverings reminded me of a cheap banquet hall. Thankfully, we were able to get a circular table before our client arrived. The food was pretty average. We ordered the calamari and coconut shrimp to start (average). A few of us ate the french onion soup (average). Several people wanted to order the filet mignon; however, to our disappointment, they were out of filets?! It shocked me becaues you'd think that a place that had \"steakhouse\" in the name would always have this item available. Unfortunately, not that day. I ordered the greek salad with chicken, and it was again... average. The dressing was a little funky; chicken was dry. All in all, a pretty big let down. The only real upside was that the wait staff was very attentive throughout our meal and extremely friendly. I would avoid Morel's if possible!",

    "text": "Celebrated our Anniversary at Morels Steakhouse and dined using their Summer Tasting Menu.  Four courses (Starter, App, Salad and Entree) for $45.  We also opted for the wine pairing, 4 wines for $20. A great deal overall, but be aware the wine pours are a tasting only, so about 1-2 oz each.  The courses are all reduced from full sizes, but with the four it was satisfying enough, however the food itself was fairly standard.  Starter course: Curry Shrimp (very good) / Fried Calamari (not as tender as it should be). App course: Beef Slider and fries (Beef overcooked, Fries very good) / Mussels (Very small mussels and the broth too watery and salty to be enjoyed with bread). Third course: Greek Salad (some of lettuce was bitter, but olives were wonderful) / Caesar salad (very standard). Entree course: Top Sirloin and Potato Puree (well cooked and good) / Same Top Sirloin but added Crab Oscar (Cooked to temp as requested, but crab was very tiny and strings of crab (canned?) and Bearnaise was pretty hard to find on top).  Overall the food was good, and nothing that would be sent back to the kitchen, but was a bit too normal for the reputation of Morels Steakhouse in Vegas.  The service was top of the line, from the seating through the end of the meal.  They  all were aware of our celebration, and from host to server to manager, all congratulated us on our anniversary, along with a complimentary dessert of Creme Brule, which was the best part of the meal.  Sad to say, excellent service will only last a short time, as the food is why we all go, so for the price and food quality, there are other competitors in Vegas that will probably gain my business in the future.",

    "text": "When in Vegas, do as the Veygans do, they dine at really nice steakhouses. And what better way to do than then by going to my favorite hotel in Vegas, the Palazzo and eating at Morels Steakhouse.  But I do have to say, the real reason I came here, what excited me so much, was actually the cheese and mushroom souffle. I love chocolate souffle, and I think the only thing better than a chocolate souffle is a cheese souffle. This is a must order! But keep in mind they only serve it at certain times like brunch and/or lunch possibly so call ahead to be sure.  Chef Jose really took the thinking out of everything. I didn't even have to look at the menu. I put my trust in him and he took us on a delicious journey of which I'll never forget. From a crab amuse bouche, to scallops served in fancy shells.  The restaurant group that owns Morels also owns Market City Caffe in Burbank, CA. I will always remember the time I went in to try their summer special and they served this incredibly fresh and delicious salad with fresh peaches. As soon as I mentioned that, they brought me two of their finest and yummiest salads on their menu. I mean, its salad and yet they make it so memorable!  For our main dish, we went with the Tomahawk. I'm not sure why I resort to this cut of steak, maybe because its big enough to feed 2 people. Maybe it's the marbling? Or maybe it's for the photo op with the bone :) Either way, it was quite the experience. This will be my #forevermood.  For the sides, we couldn't decide between the mac and cheese and the potatoes. So we went with both! The lobster mac and cheese was definitely more indulgent but both are perfect in their own right.  The staff is so very attentive. You will literally feel like you stepped in and became a celebrity overnight.  Although it was really hot when we went, they do have an outside patio that you might love because it is right in all the hubub on the strip. Great place to really treat yourself.",

My friend got the American Breakfast with French pressed coffee. The French toast was spot on! And with the addition of bacon it balanced the sweet with savory. Which was what Chris said. She was delightful & a good conversationalist. Keeping our beverages filled. She also told us about the Dinner menu & we will definitely be back at a later date for that.

    "text": "I've been coming to Morel's since it first opened and with all that comes and goes in this town this restaurant is still striving for a good reason. I usually like dining on the outdoor patio, but it was a bit chilly on my last visit, so we sat inside. I made a reservation for a party of 10 and the restaurant had a nice table set for us to enjoy brunch. We were checked on often and the server was great about splitting checks.   I started out with some French Press Coffee that was enjoyable. The coffee would have paired great with the complimentary beignets sprinkled in a good amount of cinnamon and sugar that they brought to the table, but they were chewy and not hot. Bummer.   Onion Soup Gratinee ($10) - This soup shouldn't be passed up! It was cheesy and rich with flavor. Perfect way to start you meal or even a nice lunch on a cold day.   Banana and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast ($16) - I'm so glad I ordered this because it was excellent! Others that tried some at my table loved it and said they would come back just for this. I'd have to agree. The outside of the french toast had this delicious crunch of cinnamon flavor. On the top was a decent amount of tasty bananas, the syrup was very good and the inside had the perfect amount of yummy filling. I also added a side of bacon for $6, I think it was 5 pieces, and it was thick and very good.  Imported Mushroom Souffle ($15) - Egg whites, morels, gruyere and sauce mornay with a side salad. Flowing high above the ramekin, this was one tasty dish. I'd definitely recommend the french toast and this dish for breakfast or brunch.   French Dip with Au Jus ($17) - Sliced prime rib, emmental cheese, caramelized onion and horseradish cream served with a side of fries. This is what my hubby ordered and he asked that the horseradish cream be left off which wasn't a problem. The sandwich could have been a smidge bigger, but wow that prime rib had such good flavor! Fries were also good.   Almost Famous Mac and Cheese ($10) - This was cheesy, creamy and the portion was big. Can't say I'd want this as my main meal, but it works as a shared side dish.   Baked Alaska - I'm not sure what this cost because my friend and fellow yelper, Jessica P. was thoughtful enough to treat our table to this dessert. I have to say it was comical when we all had our cameras ready for when this dessert was brought out and lit, but it was one failed attempt after another. Let me tell you a lot of rum was poured on the meringue before we finally had some flame action going on. The dessert was good, but there was definitely a strong taste of rum in each and every bite and while that usually shouldn't be a problem wanting more alcohol in certain things, it was a bit much on this dessert.   During brunch they have bottomless mimosas for $25 and a handcrafted \"bloody\" cart where for $17 you can have a Bloody Mary or Maria handcrafted table-side. Definitely a solid brunch, lunch or dinner spot. Morel's is located inside The Palazzo.",

For a higher end steakhouse, find another place. I don't think we'll come back unless they up how they prepare their meats.   Sirloin- chewy. Bland. Can see why they offer rock salts of 3 kinds. Sauce that goes with the steak wasn't good but I needed some flavor to my steak.   Seafood pasta- seafood wasn't chewy. A bit bland also. But still good to eat.   Rib eye- chewy. Odd when it should be melting in your mouth.   Filet mignon- softer but bland also. Are we supposed to flavor our own meats? I don't like that idea.   Mac and cheese side- good but on the bland side.   Grilled asparagus- good!   Chicken strips and fries- for the kids- same as last time. Why is this the best thing we tasted? It was yummy!  Customer service- Our server was awesome! Very accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu ingredients. Him and his wait staff were all prompt and quick to respond to requests. I can come back if service is amazing and food was decent, but the food is just lacking in every way. At least they were very nice!!",

I got the Croque Madam, the dish itself was quite tasty (ham was a bit tasteless thus the 4 star rating) the cheese perfectly melted but the True star of the meal was my side of toast.. it was so perfectly done and the bread had such a nice texture and taste. Combine that with their homemade jam and butter it was amazing. A very good overall experience and waiter quite attentive.",

    "text": "Worst Venetian restaurant ever, do not go here unless you want bland, undercooked food with a management staff that could careless about you as a customer.  Just finished dinner 6/8, and disappointment was a key theme. We came here with a group of 6. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Our waiter was super nice though, although service was a bit slow to start with.  Two of us Ordered 2 \"specials\" which were filet mignon Oscar style - medium rare. Inconsistency is in this kitchen's name. These guys don't even salt their protein!!! Aside from the fact that the outside of the steaks were over charred, almost to the point of burnt, one of the steaks was raw inside, while the other was just fine. The manager wouldn't even take it off the bill, he wouldn't even come out to talk to us about the bill. All he said was \"I'm sorry for the sashimi, I'll have them cook it more thoroughly.\" To my surprise he had them cook the raw pieces rather than re-fire a steak from scratch. Needless to say that re-fired steak was not eaten, as it was over the desired doneness.  The hollandaise sauce that came with it, was metallic tasting, good thing they left it on the side, and it was all crusted over like it had been sitting there for a while.  I ordered the swordfish, it was cooked right, but was missing seasoning - can someone say 'salt and pepper'  The only good dish was the sea bass. It was cooked right, and the broth that it was in was delicious. We also had a creme brulee, and that was actually pretty good.  I didn't want to cause a scene with not having one of the filets taken off the bill, so we just left.  The picture of the steak looks better than it was (forgot to take a picture of the raw steak sliced horizontally).",

I ordered their granola and yogurt which was pretty good and their veggie omelette which I thought was fine, though a bit bland and nothing memorable.  It was hard for me to tell through pictures, but portions here are huge and big enough for two people to share.  Service was not spectacular - our server wasn't paying attention and ended up spilling water when she was filling our glasses.  She also was nowhere to be found when we were ready for our check.  Maybe the experience would have been a bit nicer had we sat outside; instead we were inside next to a couple of big and loud parties.  Morels is pretty convenient if you are staying at Palazzo; overall though, the experience was just okay and I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

Initially our server was attentive and friendly, but he lost interest in bothering with us and it became harder and harder to get his attention.  The other staff were excellent and helpful, but once the food began to arrive, it became clear that this place is more about the appearance of class and quality than the actual substance of it.  Our pasta was rich but rather flavourless, the fish was overcooked, and the fancy smoked salt they made such a fuss about ruined one of the steaks.  They did remove the steak from the bill and were very generous with birthday celebrations, but the food itself didn't sit especially well in our stomachs.   I might consider going back for a second chance if someone else really insisted it was good, but it overall seemed a lackluster experience.",

There is a large cheese bar that you walk from the bar to the dining room If you're a cheese fan, you'll be very excited.  We started with a seafood platter that had lobster, crab, oysters and calamari. It was delicious but our plates were removed when we still had about half the platter left. There seemed to be some confusion about what the service staff was supposed to do when the soups were ready to come out. We got out plates back and I really liked the oysters. I heard the soup was good. The red meat selection and presentation is impressive. There is wet and dry aged meat, boneless and bone in. There's also Japanese Wagyu which is pricey, meaning three figures. I had the bone in New York steak cooked medium rare. Everyone in our group got steak and all five of them were rolled out on a little table. We also shared several sides, including mashed potates and mushrooms. The steak and sides were delicious.  The desserts were good as well. We had the chocolate souffle which we had to order when you got our steaks. The waiter kindly made up aware of the souffles and they are definitely worth ordering. One issue I had was that the dining room was dimly lit but on the plus side it was quite enough for conversation.",

First of all, the front desk lacked a sense of welcome (If I have to say hello first, there's a problem) Our waiter was unfriendly and \"snooty\", not that I have high expectations but I'm no stranger to a great restaurant and good service.  After our meal was selected, it was like a drag race to the end! Good service is being attentive, but definitely not rushed.  Since every table gets 3 people for service, you'd think table conversation would be great between the 3. Wrong!! Not even one of them made us feel welcomed. I think since there were three, each one assumed the other was taking care of us,  3 = 0 at this point. Overall, I would not return to this restaurant. The worst experience you can have at a restaurant is the feeling of unwelcome. Seriously, I would have rather spent double the money in a restaurant that knows this.  I don't recommend Morels and will not return. Here's to all the people who gave this place a good review....you got lucky!",

    "text": "Well well well ... Sort of a typical restaurant in Vegas, but in a good way. Like other restaurants on the strip, Morels offers beautiful ambiance, great food, attentive service, good wine selection ... Yet, without being pretentious. It offers outdoor dining, but it was closed for the night because of they forecast rain that day. We got there early, and ordered wine and champagne at the bar and sat outside.  i dined there on valentine's day. They have a special pre fixe menu for the occasion, but also served the regular menu, which I think is great. I would have been pretty upset if I couldn't choose and HAD to order the special menu.  There were 2 of us, we started off with sharing a fondue and then a dozen of oysters. They have a cheese bar, and as expected, the fondue is delicious. I don't know why I ordered seafood in a desert, but the oysters are great. Then, we had a filet mignon with a side pommes frites and the \"18 hour braised beef short rib\". The filet was juicy and done perfectly, but the presentation is \"very interesting\". There was the white plate, with the piece of meat in the middle and a slice of butter on top. Just that. I understand the simplicity and to showcase the steak just by itself, but I don't know if it looked that appetizing. Anyways, the fries were alright, but the truffle mayonnaise dip is fantastic. The short rib is of course really good. Tender, flavorful, but what could have gone wrong with braised rib. We were very full and didn't have dessert, but I would love to try their cheese plate if I come again.  On a side note, Morels is located almost right on the strip across from Treasure Island. When I made the reservation, I thought it would be nice to sit there, and be able to see their show. Well, I guess I had a long dinner, because I saw that show once at the bar, and again and again during dinner; and they lasted like 10 minutes. The explosions of fire, fireworks, lightings were rather distracting the second time, and a bit annoying for the third, even when I was dining indoor. It has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but it might be something you want to consider when you book a table here for a date.",

    "text": "I had multiple problems at Morels. Once seated, we sat there for 10 minutes before anyone came by to talk to us or even give us a menu. Then we waited another 30 minutes for a piece of bread. One of the steaks that we ordered was raw in the middle and took them 2 times to re-fire the steak to get it to a rare center. I went with a group of 10, so when we went to pay the check, we attempted to split it on our credit cards. We were then told they could only split it on 3 cards. The reason I was given is that each transaction costs a fee, so they only allow 3 cards. Each dish we ordered was $60+ with sides, drinks, tax, and gratuity on top of that. Ridiculous to say a transaction fee on at least an $80 charge was the reason why they would not allow us to use more credit cards. After arguing for a while, they then claimed the system would not allow more than 3 cards to be used at a single table. That again was a lie because later on a waiter came over who overheard and told us he knew how to pay the bill with 5 credit cards. We had to call a manager over who again said the system only allows 3 cards. After a round of arguments, we got it all settled.  It took over 45 minutes to just pay the bill. The whole dinner was a waste of my time and I will never go back to Morels. Too bad 0 stars is not an option on yelp reviews.",

The cheapest food you can eat is at the Grand Lux Cafe, where the food sucks by the way, and the free drinks you get when you sit at a slot machine. So we were in for a little treat when we sat  down at Morel's French Bistro.  As soon as you get seated the waiters will pamper you. I personally hate that kind of service, but, we were all tired of gambling and a little babying was not too bad.  We sat down and the waiters do that napkin thing onto your lap. Then several waiters come out to help you pick your wine (which was unneccesary cuz I'll ALWAYS pick the cheapest bottle n e way) and they wait next to you till you make your decision.  We started with some soup de jour which was some really buttery bacon-ie ham-ie chowder. It was too buttery for me but good. Then came the mussels for an appetizer which was pretty good. I chose the seafood fettucine which the sauce tasted like the soup i had and BAD OYSTERS. I couldn't even taste the lobster or the clams. I already had the mussels so basically i had more soup de jour with pasta. Then my bro's plate came which was the sirloin cooked medium. And my fiance's plate which was the same cooked medium-well. I had a bite of each and they both tasted GREAT. We had the artichoke side which complimented the large portions of meats.  The meat dishes were very plain (a big piece of meat plotted on a big plate with no decor) but the taste made up for what was missing. For all the money you'll be spending you'd think they'd put a little more on the plates, eh? So, i learned the next time i go to a steakhouse, STEAK is what i'll order. GEEZ. The bill came out to about $250-260? and we left a $100 tip (because of the service and it was around Christmas). So it was worth getting pampered for that amount of cash or was it all PRETENTIOUS??? I give it a 3.5",

    "text": "I was in town for major industry trade show, and some colleagues wanted steak.  Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we just dropped by around 8pm and they were able to seat us.  However, the only reason we were able to get a seat is that the outside patio was open.  While they had a few heaters amongst the tables, ours did not have one.  So we were quite cold throughout the dinner.  First off, let me say that the food is very good.  I don't think there was a single complaint or issue with the food.  I had the bone-in rib eye, and it was superb.  My colleagues also enjoyed their entrees.  That said, here was the bad during my dining experience.  First, we asked for a wine menu, which our waiter completely forgot when he came back to take our order.  So after ordering a 2005 cab from Napa, we received a 2006.  Unfortunately, my colleague didn't notice this, and he was the one who had selected it and approved the bottle.  Second, after we were served our entrees, we asked for steak knives.  They could only scrounge up 2!  How can a steakhouse run out of steak knives?  I don't know, but they did.  Finally, I would have expected them to move the heaters around as they become available from tables being vacated, especially given how it was cold that night.  It wasn't until I mentioned it to one of the waiters that they made any effort to move them around.  So, while a restaurant may have great food, the overall experience can be ruined by a lack of quality service from the staff.  So I give them only 3 stars out of 5.",

I also got the oysters and the temperature was just right.  Wine list was very impressive.",

    "text": "Eh.. I really really wanted to like this place after reading the good reviews. First, it is a very  nice restaurant. Great ambiance, great views, location, everything is great. Just the extremely slow, slow service (experct to be there for 2+ hours) and the not so amazing food and drinks. We waited fifteen minutes after we were seated to get our menus, then an additional 25 to get drinks and bread. When our champagne came, it was flat and we had to send it back. The manager came over with a new glass, from a brand new bottle, which was nice. Second, the food is not amazing, but it's not bad. For Vegas quality, it is amazing. But if you have dined at fine restaurants all over the world you will  not be impressed with this restaurant. Overall, this is one of the nicer restaurants in Vegas, with nice (but slow) service - meaning no usual Vegas attitude, and decent food.",

We started off with a glass of wine at the bar, got seated, saw their great raw bar and cheeses in the front.  We ordered half dozen oysters, they really melt in your mouth.  The hama hama oysters were my favorite.  We ordered 2 salads, I had the chefs special watermelon arugula salad, IT WAS TO DIE FOR and the heirloom tomato salad, both simply amazing.  My main was the seafood pasta, which was excellent because there was more seafood than the pasta, usually its the other way around at those shitty places.  I took a bite of the steak that was ordered and I usually dont care for medium rare steak, but it was so tender and delicious I thought it was amazing.  Also came the pomme frittes with mayo truffle sauce, the mac and cheese, and the corn.  The corn was the weakest dish of the 3, but all very good.  We also ordered a bottle of rose champagne, it was a great compliment to our meal, everything from start to finish was executed well.",

    "text": "Went there last Saturday night....was staying at the Wynn, but decided to check this place out (already went to the SW, and didn't like it too much).  Everything was off to a great start...the entrance/grand lobby of the Palazzo (impressive), the very nice and laid-back environment (sure beats the crap animation show and music at the SW), the excellent service, the 3 fantastic bottles of wine (sommelier's choice), the oyster/lobster appetizers, excellent side dishes...I was ready to chalk it up as a 5.  They got everything right so far, and heck, all they have to do is serve a decent steak.  Then I got the Kansas City steak (essentially their NY steak)......it was horrendous.  They didn't cook it properly.....asked for medium rare, and this could barely pass as a suitable rare (I know, I know, some people ask for a cold middle).....we're talking 85% red-pink and 5% grey.  I finished about 2 bites, but  I'm not one to complain, and besides, I'm not going to return the steak and have them use their special sauce (I wasn't feeling too hungry anyways).  But at the end of the meal, I let our server know.....another member of our party criticized his steak as well (too charbroiled.....at a place like this, wtf?  Not as bad as mine, but still crap).  Our server took our steaks away to show the chef.  I've been to places where they would take the steak off the bill...fine not both, but maybe one.  I could really care less about the money...it's the whole principle of it, you know?  Either way, we weren't the only table complaining......the table right next to us, this older gentleman sent back his steak as soon as he took his first bite.  Either way, everything but the steak was just fine.  But it's a steakhouse...they're not supposed to mess up.  The chef did give us tiny little cookies afterwards (\"on the house\").  What class.  But the reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the other members of my party enjoyed their meals.  I must admit I have been spoiled by the fine steakhouses in the Bay Area, CA.  But I would have expected more from Morels.  My best guess is that if I go there again, I'll probably have a great steak.  But first impressions are also important......",

Food and drinks are very, very good.  Their bartenders are world class; better than almost all the dining room waiters I've had in Vegas (wouldn't know about Morel's dining room, though).  They are so knolwedgeable about both drinks and the restaurant's menu, and make it clear they're there to make you comfortable and have a good time.  The bartenders have never batted an eye to my special requests like different sauces or split plates.   Even the totally out of line complainer in my group last time had his perfectly good drink replaced no questions asked, just to make him happy.  Food recommendations?  Well, everything I've had so far has been great, like the mini beef wellington and artichoke, but I'd walk a thousand miles for the short rib sliders!",

We originally planned to dine at a busier more popular restaurant, but since we were running late we decided to dine here since it was most convenient during our stay at the Palazzo. Boy, are we glad we chose this place!  We were taken care of by Alfonso and Bing, who were both incredibly sweet and accommodated our schedule to make sure we weren't running late for our plans later in the night! Bing even offered several times to take photos of our group and kept snapping pictures throughout our meal to make sure she captured the best moments. Alfonso even created a custom & delicious, blueberry-vodka mojito for us.  The cocktails were yummy, the bone-in-rib-eye was so tender and delicious. It was one of the best steaks ever and wasn't just a steak that was covered up with other spices. The chef took such great care in presenting each dish and explaining the unique flavors he put into it. You can tell he really cares about people enjoying his food! The fondue was yummy as well, and was enjoyed by all.   I would recommend this place to others, the service is amazing.",

Our waiter Robert was outstanding. He made a tableside Caesar salad that was as good as I have ever had. In addition, for dessert he made us a tableside chocolate mousse that was unbelievable. The mousse alone is worth the trip. The main courses were great; one strip steak, and one halibut. All very tasty; try the salt selection with the steak. The maitre'D  Jerry Koran also made us feel very welcome. I know there are a lot steak houses in LV, but very few offer the warmth and hospitality that we received at Morel's.",

I had the \"Classic\" eggs Benedict which was far what I'd consider classic and it was alright ,but not exceptional.  I think it's tough for a restaurant in Las Vegas as the standards are set so high here with what feels like infinite choice.  I'd probably skip this place in the future and look for something a little more inviting.",

We had to ask several times for different condiments.   and.... food is just OK. For the price, you would think extraordinary.  I got the ham and cheese crepe, it was good, but I've had better.  My sister got the benedict and it was very messy and hard to eat.

Located at the Palazzo hotel <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=q_XliEMMc_vle_IYjdF3kQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>, Morels is a nicely designed space, done in dark understated yet rich tones, accented by Murano chandeliers and Tom Cannon's enormous, in your face art, all of naked female form.    As an aside, Tom Cannon must be a real lover of breast implants.  Not one boob in his paintings looked natural.  I couldn't decide if it was art or more of a cartoon-type work, but as the idiom goes, \"The boob is in the eye of the beholder\".  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=hiLDnJAUR6o9vAEH_8BmVQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aLI33JvcXjoe6vI-xbVvXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  It has a beautiful wine bar and a spacious comfortable terrace (which they call a patio).  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=2hBacW9b6INPycSDqY11GA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aiZj8CkK1NSFhI7ujjQZ5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=YQlwdGgpkhjKjtErmQjuLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  Here's a virtual tour: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdelivery.vrxstudios.com%2F50372%2Fvirtualtours.htm%3Fid%3D386407%26id_type%3D2%26locale%3D1%26container%3D1&s=3e1f0f04ac2b32d9bbde569ee2782d57a597d888f5584e97a98ac907e2750d9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">delivery.vrxstudios.com/...</a>  We were a group of 7.  Our table wasn't ready so we were offered to have drinks on the terrace.  As beautiful and comfortable as it is, if you don't care for the Las Vegas heat, you don't want to be there.  Maybe in February.  Some of us opted for the terrace, as for the rest of us - there was not really any other available place to wait.  Once seated, we found our server Rick to be friendly and efficient.   I still don't like it when a waiter announces his name, especially in an upscale restaurant.  I've never heard anyone call \"Hey Rick\" at XIV.  Depending on people's age and preference, it's always either \"Excuse me\", \"Waiter\", or \"Excuse me, Sir\".  Why do I need his name?  I'm not planning on exchanging Christmas cards with Rick...    I ordered Onion Soupe Gratinee and 18 Hour Red Wine Braised Short Rib, which was a mouthful, even before I got any food.  My date shared a Petite Romaine Heart Salad, served tableside, for two or more, with a friend.  For the main course, he ordered Grilled Halibut.  Almost everyone else ordered Kansas City Steak and Choice Filet Mignon.  We already had cocktails, so we shared 2 bottles of Red, don't remember which, but I do remember that Rick said that decent wine starts at $75.00 a bottle at Morels...  My soup was delicious, rich, full of onion and cheese flavors, and a good size. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=_k3UURyS2x98gCP0gEkl8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  As to Petite Romaine Heart Salad, I was told that it was good, but that Petite applied to the size of the salad instead of that of the romaine hearts... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=pUHu4Va2XWQiWft7sxzuDw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  Then came my favorite part of the evening.  Our entrees arrived.  It was like a beautifully orchestrated symphony.  Seven waiters plus waiters' assistants all descended on our table at exactly the same time.  Things were moved, knives were placed, glasses were repositioned, and all our seven entrees magically landed in front of us at the exact same moment.  Talk about food orgasm, this was service orgasm!  My short rib was excellent, you could really appreciate the tastes embedded in it in 18 hours.    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=GOnQcXc3tlm9SpNKq9fRqQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  My date's halibut was OK, I was told, but it looked really tiny.   All side dishes are extra, by the way, so if you want a side of steamed asparagus, for example, that alone will knock you $14.00.  If you want a different sauce - that's extra too.   Now to the steaks.  Of the 5 people who ordered them, 2 or 3 complained that the cut wasn't what it was supposed to be, that the beef was too chewy, and one complained of an overcooked steak.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=CIYQHfa3dExTAv4OMLw-ng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  To make us feel better, we were comped two desserts for the entire table of 7 (a little stingy, considering, if you ask me).  So, based on my food alone, it would have been 4 stars, but given the bad steaks in a steakhouse, and prices that I thought were too high, the most I can give is 3.    Knowing that I will be writing a review, I, very not ladylike, craned my neck to see what my date was paying.  Two entrees, two appetizers, and about half a bottle of wine (maybe a diet coke too) - around $200.00.  Ouch.  If you happen to go there on a cool evening, sit on the terrace, you'll have an amazing view of the Strip AND you can see the Sirens of Treasure Island show that's across the street and runs a couple of times a night.",

The mussels were in a very overly sour sauce & with cous cous (the highlight of my meal) that I couldn't pick up with a fork because of how soggy they were. I won't come back.

What I got was a steak that was faintly pink in exact middle of the steak and burnt on the ends and well done throughout most of the steak and dry.  They did give me butter to douse the steak in.  The Mac and cheese was ok, but the potatoes were dry, very dry.     The waiter did gives us a free creme brulee, said to tell folks it was our anniversary, he was sorry for the steak.

Bone in ribeye was horrible, over charred and cold in the middle!?  Filet mignon dry and cold!  Are these steaks frozen?!  Don't even think about ordering the $36 lobster Mac & cheese...in-eatable, disgusting fishy taste, is this lobster from a can...paired with old dried up pasta, probably RE cooked then nuked...burnt on the outside, cold on the inside!!!  The Bartender was great. Terrific wines. Horrible service. One waiter kept dropping utensils on my guests as he was cleaning up or refreshing silverware...not to mention reaching over one diner across to his right to place utensils!  WTF. Wake up Morels or you will be closing your doors soon.  I don't mind spending $2,000 for dinner, but never again here. Shame on you Venetian and Morels Steakhouse",

We were initially presented with a salty Olive Tapenade, butter with Hawaiian Sea Salt, and delicious soft warm rolls.  Quickly following were Wild Caught Prawns that were cold and meaty, and a Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce.  My other preliminary course was a crock of excellent sweet Onion Soup Gratinee with a large and well-deconstructed crouton and well-melted Comte and Gruyere Cheeses.  Both of us then enjoyed the night's featured Surf & Turf Special of Filet and Half-Lobster.  We each received a very nice lobster half and a nicely seasoned 8 oz. Filet with little char cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The lobster meat was sweet dipped in either drawn butter or specially requested Buerre Blanc, and ran out just a few bites ahead of the Filet.  Excellent whipped Mashed Potatoes accompanied the combo entree.  Three flavored sea salts were also provided: Black Hawaiian Sea Salt, Smoked Black Sea Salt, and Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.  We finished with very good Classic Profiteroles served with Candied Vanilla Almond Ice Cream and Malted Chocolate Sauce.  I just wish there had been more ice cream.  Our booth back was hard but seating was otherwise comfortable, with a nice cushioned bottom.  Sensually appealing fine art adorned several walls.  Service was excellent except for tea sweeteners initially being removed prematurely.  Chamomile Decaf Iced Tea was specially made for me, with needed refills quickly supplied without request.  The dining room was not that crowded on a Saturday night.                   In sum, we found Morels to be an upscale dining venue with a nice classy ambiance, fine food, and excellent service!",

    "text": "Review is based on brunch during Restaurant Week 2016:  I made a reservation for our group on Opentable for 11 on a Sunday. When we arrived there was no wait and we were given the choice of dining on the patio or inside. Summers in Vegas are no joke, so I was slightly apprehensive about dining al fresco in June, but the patio was nicely shaded and quite comfortable.   Service by our waiter Richard was good, he was friendly and did not seem put off by the fact that we were ordering from the RW menu or that we would be sharing our meals. We decided to go with the Classic Benedict for $20 and the Steak Frites for $30, both 3 course meals.  All of the food we had was well made and tasted great. The fruit was fresh and the greek salad has a delightfully light vinaigrette dressing. Our steak was tender and cooked exactly as we had requested. The benedict was a great portion size for sharing, with yummy smoked ham on brioche. Our third course was desserts; a creamy and decadent creme brulee as well as a crepe served with chocolate sauce, strawberries, bananas and whipped cream.    The only issues I had with our meal were minor service related snafus:  -I would have ordered a Bloody Mary from the cart however at no point was it offered.   -The breakfast we selected came with french press coffee, which we had to ask for. -Third course came out as we were still very clearly working on the second.   Even with these minor issues, our time at Morels was very enjoyable. I left happy and full, and would gladly return to dine there again.",

Unfortunately our special night that we had planned at Morels for dinner was less than satisfactory due to the fact that there was no seafood available at all! We were so looking forward to the many choices on the menu and was told that what we wanted was not available. No seafood at all! Yes it was Labor Day but that isn't an excuse just poor planning! Sal as I said did everything in his power to keep us at this restaurant. We came from a long distance to stay at the luxurious Palazzo and to have our special anniversary dinner at Morel's! So disappointed! We decided to give Morel's one last chance on our departing day and have breakfast. Sal our server wasn't there but we had a great breakfast! Crab Benedict and buttermilk pancakes, and Lox and bagels. Delicious!",

Ignored us a dozen times walking right past us after taking our menus without asking if we were ready to order, never asked us how the food was probably because we had to flag down another server with arms full of dirty plates (taking care of her own party of 8!!) who was nice enough to take our order.  He never apologized or got any better.   Next: table was not ready when they tried to seat us, he never brought utensils/napkins (had to be brought after the food was served) and the poor guy had 4 tables.  The food was actually good, however he blamed his poor service on the bartender and the kitchen being backed up.   We will pass on this restaurant next time",

But when you get a $40 credit for brunch at two places, you have to try them both on a 3 day trip to Vegas.  Boschon (the other place with the credit) was WAAAAY better.  I had a delicious Mimosa and a so-so breakfast.  I think it was Eggs Benedict and toast and nothing I remembered too much.  The service was awesome (usually is when you are the only patron).  But the outdoor patio was literally right above the strip and there was traffic and street noise.  It was like eating at an intersection.  And it was hot and sunny inside.     Maybe Dinner is better?     Meh.",

There were a couple groups whose children were running around their table next to ours.  When we discretely asked to be moved, the restaurant seated us outdoors even though I asked for inside seating and saw other open tables inside the restaurant.    Sometimes, the food makes up for the ambiance.  In this case, it did not.  The bread used for the croque madame had a strange consistency to it (lumpy) and the quiche lorraine tasted a bit too custard-like. The Honduran coffee, lobster mac and cheese, and skirt steak and eggs were (just) okay, but I was aiming a bit higher than what Morel's achieved.  It might have been an off-day for them, but I will not take my family back again, especially for a special occasion.  There are just too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to settle for less.",

    "text": "This is a review for breakfast. We went this morning and I ordered the American breakfast, which comes with three organic eggs, which I ordered sunny side up, and potatoes and a choice of meat, so I picked bacon, all organic. It also comes with brioche, yet only one slice of brioche like one slice of bread, not the classic two slices that one expects with an American breakfast. French pressed coffee or orange juice are included, and I ordered french pressed coffee.  The coffee is very good. The breakfast itself was just OK. I would not order it again. I did not like only one slice of bread being that I ordered my eggs sunny side up to dip the bread in them. I also think that if you are going to advertise American breakfast, make sure that it is by standards and everybody serves two slices of toast, not one. The bacon was thick and it was delicious so that was very good. My friend ordered a side of sausage links and they were OK. The potatoes were a huge disappointment for me. They were not spiced well and in fact tasted earthy. I had Ketchup to go with them but I would not want to order them again. My friend ordered a free range egg crab omelette that came with a lovely side salad that looked really good and a slice of brioche toast. She said the omelette was not that great and it was quite large. The salad was just ok too.  What I was not impressed with was that, at the beginning, they bring out these triangle like bread dumplings that are covered in sugar... One of my friends said it tasted like churros. I thought it tasted like pure sugar. All I know is that it was too sweet and that is not what one is served in Paris, as this restaurant is considered a French steakhouse. I would have rather had an extra slice of brioche with my breakfast then those bread dumplings. The restaurant itself is lovely and the service is very friendly. Therefore, breakfast was just OK to not so great and it would not be my first choice in the future, although I would not ever order the American breakfast again and would not recommend it.",

I rarely get steak when I'm out, but I got it last night and omg was it good. Others got the short ribs which tasted yummy and there were a few other selections on the table. The Truffle Mac & Cheese is really good, but I admit I'm a sucker for crispy onions. Asparagus and artichoke sides were also SO good. I LOVE getting a cheese selection for dessert - specially when it comes with some honey and some fig jam. Happy happy happy! And the waitstaff was awesome - all 5 of them. That kind of service is such a rare treat - very well done. Wish I could remember even one of their names.   We decided to back for breakfast this morning and our server was LIsa. She should be cloned. She should be made waitstaff trainer. We can be a tough group and she handled like a pro. Great attitude and excellent style. The food was great. Mascarpone French Toast with bananas - mmm mmm good. Omelette was good, but not great. Fruit plate with yogurt looked gorgeous. The coffee came non-stop. And those raspberry filled beignets were exquisite. They may be the same ones they serve up at Bouchon. Insanely good.   Anyway - Morel's at The Palazzo. Yum!",

My drink order was incorrect and they made it seem like it was my fault .  My $60 rib eye was stringy, had some gristle and was barely warm on its presentation.  The $11 pommes frites (French fries) were good, but no better than those that you get at McDonalds for 1/4 the price.  Wine is sold by the ounce!  Convenient location near the lobby of Palazzo and an okay interior.  Overall, a bellow average dining experience.

At $20/pound raw in 1985, we happily splurged.  Such is the case at Morels French Steakhouse and Bistro in Las Vegas. Expect to pay top prices for the traditional shrimp cocktail, and expect a fresh taste of the sea.  Alas, no such luck with the rest of the menu.

The boneless filet mignon (cheerfully butterflied and cooked well-done at my request, since the menu inaccurately indicated that the chef would only cook steaks rare to medium) melted in my mouth, seasoned generously with (I'm guessing) black pepper and rosemary. Sauce, scrumptious and served on the side, was not even necessary. Amazing wine, selected from the wine list displayed on an iPad left at our table, and the best negroni cocktail I've ever had. The desserts were heavenly and beautifully plated. The staff was welcoming, attentive, intuitive, courteous, helpful, and not annoyingly hover-y. A beautiful room, quiet music (unlike the I-can't-hear-you-even-if-you're-screaming-at-the-top-of-your-lungs-directly-into-my-ear-there's-a-G.D.-DEEjay-in-a-pricey-restaurant-LAVO-next-door), and a soothing atmosphere. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that my endive-and-poached-pear salad was, although fresh and fine, unremarkable and bland save for the addition of toasted cashews. Asparagus was flawlessly cooked, and the Potatoes Dauphinois are sex on a plate.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week gives me the opportunity to try places that I normally wouldn't be able to afford. It's low risk with a sometimes high reward. In this case that was True. I went for breakfast, so It may not be the most accurate representation of the food quality for dinner (it's really hard to make a terrible breakfast). I really enjoyed the personal french press coffee, juevos racheros were tasty, banana and marscopone french toast was as good as you think it was, croque madame was filling, and the service was exceptional. Because I went for breakfast on a weekday it was not busy and I got to sit outside. I actually went there twice in one week. The second time it was a perfect day and our server let us linger for about 2.5 hours and was the perfect amount of attentive without being overbearing. Two things I thought were underwhelming were the sugar doughnuts (just ok, nothing to write home about) and the bloody marys. Yes they make it at your table, but I don't buy into that hype. I don't care if you make it in front of me, in the bar, in the kitchen, or in the back alley if it isn't good. The bloody mary is underwhelming. I say skip the \"fancy\" at your table bloodies and get an extra entree to share with the table.",

    "text": "Overall service was good. Always had our water glasses filled, bread came quickly, the overall flow of the entire night was good with most of those small things that make a great dining experience.  A couple of taboos, that weren't a big deal to us, but shouldn't be overlooked- - Ordered wine with our dinner. The sommelier brought the wine over, showed the bottle to my fiancee, asked him of he'd liked it decanted, he answered yes. Then the sommelier put the bottle down and walked away. About 10 mins later the waiter came over and opened the bottle, then promptly threw the cork in the trash. After tasting, he poured it in our glasses. - I was lusting after the escargot for our appetizer and was told about 10 mins after I ordered it that they were out. - When we arrived we were told our table was running about 10 mins behind, so we went to the bar. For my pre-dinner drink I ordered my standard dirty martini w/ blue cheese olives. The waitress at the bar told me they may be out of the blue cheese olives so I asked if they could stuff some for me. She gave me some snide comment about it. For a French restaurant at this price point I should have never been told they may be out - did they run out of olives or blue cheese? No. They may run out of those that they stuffed already earlier in the night - stuff some more. - My mother and I ordered the special, fillet w/ crab on top and 4 asparagus spears. I didn't ask the price, so that was a bit my fault if I really cared, but the regular fillet of the same size was about $30 less than the special turned out to be. Not worth the ~1oz of crab on top of the fillet. Even besides that, the fillet wasn't great.   It feels like nit-picking when looking at what I've written, but for a nice dinner out, where we took my Mom & Dad out for their birthdays, when in the end we had a $600 bill for 4 people, both my fiancee and I had the same 'ehh, not worth it and won't go back' feeling of the entire night, especially the 'ehh-ness' of the food. And these that I listed were not all of the small deficiencies we saw throughout the night. Hoping that a manager reads this and corrects his staff. Of all of the wonderful, high end restaurants in Vegas that I've been to, this is one I will not be recommending not visiting again.",

I had the house cabarnet, served in a generously sized mini carafe was my second glass. Not bad for a house glass, sweeter side like a pinot, but the drinkability of a merlot. My buddy had makers on rocks, but filled the entire glasd with makers to the rim. Not complaining at all, the bartender definitly hooked it up with two beverages in one glass. Nice touch bartender We proceeded outside because it was a beautiful day, sat under an umbrella table with a gorgeous view of the strip! We wanted something light to munch on so we ordered the bread, jam, and cheese. Toasted french bread, with a prune and dates jam(whole fruits still in), honey spread with pieces of honeycomb still in, and a delisously two+ year aged parmesan. Seems odd to eat together, but it was an excellent pairing. Welcoming tentative staff, great view. Definitely recommend dining out on the patio before it gets to hot out here in the summer Enjoy :)",

The ambiance is good, with the lighting slightly on the darker side.  It looked like most everyone was having steak for dinner and the price ranged from about $30 for an 8 oz to $160 for a 8oz Kobe filet.  I went against the grain and order the arugula salad and beef shortribs.  The salad was superb.  The vinaigrette was perfectly balanced.  I'd highly recommend it.  It is garnished with small strips of bacon that were real tasty.  The shortribs were good and season well, though a bit on the dry side.  It is served on top of some mashed potatoes.  It was good, but nothing truly memorable.  The side dishes we ordered were good but the portions were a bit small.  The people in our group all had steaks and said they enjoyed it, but no one said it was a memorable experience.  Summary:  good, safe choice but clearly not as good as Bouchon, CUT, or B&B at the Venetian.",

Maybe everyone wouldnt guess that a non- celebrity chef restaraunt such as Morels, could be any better or meet a celebrities chef's standard, but what is their lost is completely my gain! =).  The service is most definitely top notch, there was a 3-1 ratio for each table. Ive been to alot of more expensive restaraunts, and this by far beats all those snooty high- end uncomfortable restaraunts, The food was excellent, for appetizors we had the beef tarter, dozen oysters and a variety of cheeses. Me and my bf both chose the steaks; a wet aged and dry aged and they were both melt in your mouths, wonderful!..  We didnt have room for dessert, but next time I'll try to not eat as much and see what their dessert menu has to offer. I will be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas, you can bet on it! =0",

I would have sat outside if the weather permitted, but it was just way too hot.   The first thing I noticed was the ratio of employees vs patrons. There were definitely more servers and busboys than people eating so we had very attentive service. I started out with Kumamoto oysters on the half shell and my entree was Linguini Clam. The oysters were ok... not super fresh, but still good. The clam in my linguini were definitely not fresh though...It was pretty bland too... nothing to write home about. I tried some of the duck rillette. It was flavorful, but I just don't really enjoy items like that...  It was very convenient if you are staying at Palazzo, but I doubt I would come back since there are so many other options on the strip in Vegas.",

    "text": "Mediocre Food. Terrible Service. Management Doesn't Care.  I had a very disappointing experience at Morels in Las Vegas. An otherwise good and respectable brand, this particular restaurant is not only sub-par to its other locations, but very below average when it comes to restaurants in Las Vegas.   Let's start with the food. When I order a $62 steak (their Prime corn fed beef Rib Eye sans sides) I expect it to be awesome. Not OK. Not Mediocre. But simply awesome. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it. I could have gone to a real steak house (aka. Cut, Del Monico, Morton's, Mastros, ..), spent less money and gotten a better steak. The steak was blend not cooked medium-rare as I ordered. Too bad no service personnel was around to help me out, which leads me to the next chapter of disaster.  Over the course of the dinner, I must have dealt with 4 to 5 difference waiter and waitresses. There were long absences where nobody was around to help us out. I knew something was off whey they seat you at the worst table in the house (that table next to a busy door), when the restaurant is half empty and stayed so throughout the dinner. They messed the oysters I ordered, forgot the wine, and disappeared on us.   Lastly, what's almost the worst part, is management does not care the restaurant is falling apart at so many levels. On my way out, I happened to bump into a manager and briefly alerted him about my experience. I wasn't looking for a refund or a voucher, I had already paid at the time. The gentleman just did not care about the lack of quality and shrugged it off.  Las Vegas has tons of great restaurants. It has many great steak houses - stick with what you know if you want to spend some good money and skip Morels.",

    "text": "Here's one word that describes our experience at Morels:  decadent.  We were in town to watch GNR at The Joint, and I wanted to find a nice restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I read some of the reviews and was slightly apprehensive, but I took the plunge and made the reservations.    Although we were 30 minutes late, the hostess quickly sat us.  As other people have mentioned, the dining room at Morels is quite beautiful and elegant.  There's no smoking allowed which makes the dining experience that much more pleasant.  The clientele is a diverse mix.  To our right was a couple that was dressed in smart casual clothes (think dinner attire on a cruise).  To our left diagonal was a guy in a t-shirt and jeans with a mullet.  To our right diagonal was a party of 6 dressed in cocktail attire.  So in case you were wondering what the dress code was, it was fairly lenient.  We had three people helping with our table.  I, unfortunately, can only remember Mike who was the \"captain.\"  He was sensational as was his team.  Service was exemplary.  We never wanted for anything.    Our evening started out with two piping hot dinner rolls served with olive paste and creamy butter.  Then we were served the soup du jour which was a seafood bisque.  It was described to be similar to a lobster bisque.  The bisque was creamy and just hot enough to sip.  Along with the soup came the bibb lettuce and crab salad as well as the tuna tartare.  It was a very fresh and citrusy salad topped with a subtle and light tarragon dressing.  The combination of the peppers and the sesame oil in the tuna was a perfect ratio, not too overpowering on one side of the flavor palate over the other.  For dinner, my husband ordered a petite filet mignon with a side of country mac & cheese.  Though I didn't taste the pasta, I assume he enjoyed it since there was nothing left in the bowl.  I did, however, taste the filet which was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink in the middle with a nice velvety brown coating on the exterior.  It came with a side of bordelaise sauce which was a nice complement to the steak.  I ordered the 18 hour braised short rib.  Just when I thought that The Farm's short rib couldn't be topped, I was proven wrong by the dish that the chef at Morels prepared.  It was tender, had a unique flavor, probably brought on by the lardons of bacon which were part of the dish, and the quality of the beef was superb. We topped off our meal with what can only be described as a mind-blowing dessert:  the hazelnut & gianduja chocolate dome.  Try it and you'll see.  Two more items on their menu which we found impressive:  they offered Duvel and Chopin.  We dined a several places in town while we were there and nobody had either of those two items on their menu.  Lucky for us, there's a Morels closer to home at The Grove so we won't be missing it for very long.",

    "text": "No, just no.  Where do I start?  Look, I get that every good restaurant in Vegas has overinflated prices, in fact I have chastised other reviewers for commenting on that in previous reviews of other restaurants in Vegas.  But when an experience is bad, then that price just slaps you that much harder.  First, we did not have a reservation.  But the restaurant was half-empty.  They proceeded to walk us to the farthest back table, as if we were wearing escaped state pen prisoner garb.  It's hard to get the \"vibe\" and atmosphere of a joint when you are miles away from another diner.  The next major issue was the service.  I think the best word to describe it is just clumsy.  The waiter seemed disinterested.  The wait staff themselves were just a mess (at one point trying to take the side of mushrooms that was half full when we were not done eating).  When bringing the bottle of wine, they attempted to just pour it, without even  the courtesy taste.  A friend threw the hand over his glass before he could, but good grief, this is just a common courtesy.  The food.  Bland, under seasoned, boring, and meh.  Just meh.  I make a better steak and I make better mushrooms, and I'm not a great cook by any means.  I would never go back, way too many other great options in Vegas.",

Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good but for the price I think next time I'm suggesting we try another place like Bouchon.    My fiance surprised me with a 24-hr Vegas trip this weekend for my birthday (she gets 5 stars!).  We got into town at about 3pm and by the time we stopped at a store to buy liquor (including an alcohol infused whip cream) and check into our hotel is was about 4pm.  Since we knew we were going to be drinking heavily we decided to eat heavy early so we're not feeling stuffed by the time we have to go out clubbing.  Morels was close by so went with it.   Since it was between lunch and dinner the place wasn't busy at all so the service was very quick and attentive.  Although they usually have good service here even if they're busy like the other times I've gone here.   We started with the Classic Cheese Fondue.  It was pretty good.  I like the flavor of the blend of cheeses with the baguette.      Then I had the braised short ribs with a side order of mac and cheese.  The short ribs were really good, it just melted in your mouth.  You didn't even need a knife to cut it.  The bordelaise sauce that came with it was a good complement to the flavor of the ribs.  The mac and cheese on the other had was average at best.  It was kinda dry and lacking flavor.  Overall this place is pretty good (food and service) but it's a bit pricey.",

Since we we're new to the restaurant we expected our waitress to give us recommendations and she advised she had never eaten anything from the restaurant and couldn't help. So We end up ordering oysters as an appetizer and steak and fish for main course. The oysters were horrible and tasted like dirt and sewage. My bf had to get up and throw up in the restroom because the appetizer was so gross.  We had to request to take them away. Since we were off to a bad start we were hoping our meals would make up for the appetizer. Once we got our steak . It looked very appealing but ended up being the worst steak ever. It was not even seasoned .. very bland.. our fish plate was decent. We informed our waitress of how displeased we were. Not one manager came to ask us to assist and or comp at least some of our meal. Very upsetting to pay $80 so much money to get horrible food. Both of us felt sick for the rest of day. Proceed with caution",

    "text": "Our group of 10 dined at Morels in August of 2014. We make a trip to Las Vegas every summer and typically eat at one fine dining restaurant a visit. I personally go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and try to average 1 - 2 fine dining meals a trip. Earlier this trip my fiancee and I ate at Barrymore and we both felt that the meal at Morels was significantly better.  The reasons our group enjoyed our meal at Morels: Service: I was the last of the group to arrive, so I do not know how the host / hostess did with the initial greeting. I do know that our party was seated promptly and professionally. Our waiter (Jake, I think) did an excellent job of answering menu questions and making recommendations. We had one vegetarian in the group and the chef made her a special pasta dish that was not on the menu. The support staff, sommelier and management were all extremely friendly and attentive.  Food: The food was OUTSTANDING. We had 2 meat and cheese plates to start things off and they set the tone for the rest of the evening. Our group ordered oysters in the half shell (they had 4 varieties that evening) and those of us that ate them enjoyed them. Morels offers a Caesar salad for 2 that is prepared tableside and it is delicious. 80% of the group ordered steak, breaking down to 6 filets and 1 porterhouse that was split by 2 folks. I was one of the guys enjoying the porterhouse and it was fantastic. All steaks were cooked to proper temperature. In terms of side dishes, I had tastes of the asparagus, mac n' cheese and french fries. I felt the mac n' cheese was very good and the other 2 sides were solid. The french fries are skinny cut, not thick steak fries. We also ordered a few desserts, my personal favorite were the doughnuts with jam. The overall quality of the food was excellent.  Atmosphere: Our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was not very crowded when we arrived, and the atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable. There was one other large party at the restaurant when we were seated and their presence did not affect our service or enjoyment of the dining area. After our meal, we went out on the balcony, which overlooks The Strip, and enjoyed a few after dinner drinks. By the time we left, the dining room was significantly busier but not too loud.   Like any good steak restaurant, your meal will not be inexpensive. The question is: Do you feel like you got your money's worth at the end of the evening? Our group's response to this question is an overwhelming \"YES!\". I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant and plan on going back in October.",

    "text": "We really liked this restaurant. Initially, we didn't go in because upon peering into the reception area, we could see a crowded and messy store room across from the hostess' station. We thought they were under construction so we walked away. However, we liked the menu and walked in.   We had a couple of very attentive and professional wait staff checking in on us throughout the night. We had the bib salad with crab meat, which was delicious. The dozen oysters were exceptional. The cocktails were imaginative and addictive. We had the halibut, accompanied by various side dishes. Again, they were properly cooked and seasoned.   The restaurant is beautifully decorated with dramatic black chandeliers. The wine list is extensive. If I had one minor complaint, it was a few staff members brushing against my chair several times during dinner. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, service, friendly hostesses, and overall ambiance. For two people, dinner including wine and cocktails was about $250 before gratuity. Now, if only they'll close the door behind them when accessing the store room.",

The maitre'd was very pleasant, seated me right away and my server was very pleasant and attentive.   Having said that, don't waste your time or your money coming here, coupon or convenience factored in. My lunch fare of a standard moules frites and glass of Sauvignon Blanc was beyond underwhelming.  My initial pour of the glass of wine was the end of an old bottle and tasted like it. When my entree arrived, the smallest mussels I've ever seen sat in my dish. The largest few in the dish were barely average-sized. I don't know if they scale lunch down, but given its attached to a convention center, they may want to re-think that. The best part of my meal was the fries. Let me tell you, that even as a French Fry luvah, their fresh, hand-cut fries weren't enough.  Overall, skip this place and seek other options ESPECIALLY if you're not staying at the Palazzo or Venetian.",

Beautiful ambience, easy to access at front of casino and most importantly excellent food. By excellent I mean there was nothing served that wasn't excellent. I tried a bourbon play on a mojito with blackberry. Well done. Next their beet salad with fried cheese balls. Amazing salad. I LOVE beets and I really love the texture of fried quality cheese in a refined salad. It's been years since I've stumbled on a salad with it so this really worked for me.  Next I decided not to order a steak (it takes a LOT for a steak to impress me) and I was enjoying my experience too much to take the risk. So I ordered the braised short rib. Lets just say I was happy with my choice. Very well cooked, served with 3 different kinds of salts I can't pronounce and covered in onion and wine sauce and served over puree of pommes. Incredibly satisfying. I cleaned my plate.  I should also probably mention that the service was perfect. No fewer than 2 managers and 3 waiters checked on the quality of our experience. Honestly for $200 total (including drinks and appetizers for two) it was True value for the money and a must go for foodies who don't mind spending a bit every once in a while.",

Last time I visited we had our server pick a selection for us based off our interests and he did a fabulous job, it was such a fun experience.

The restaurant itself was really nice, with a nice lounge area, a patio, and paintings of naked people in a bright naturally lit room.   A few of us got burgers or sandwiches. But none of them were particularly impressed. I asked the server for a recommendation and he recommended the Pork Milanese. It was a HUGE thin cut pork chop. It had a nice crust, but kind of bland. After about 2/3 of it, I got tired of the flavor monotony and just gave up.  Pro-tip: It seems that the high reviews were from people that ordered the steaks. Maybe we should have followed suit.",

As a small business owner, I was totally impressed with this personal touch.  It also resulted in a very pleasant second meal at Morels.    We dined inside on this visit, and that was a very pleasant experience.  Nice, crisp, clean dining room with lovely paintings (of a sexual nature!) on the walls.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.  My husband and I shared the fried prawns, and they were DELICIOUS!  I loved the basil dip that came with it and saved it to go with my frites.  YUMM.  I ordered the steak frites, which was very good....even better with the dip (or pistou as the menu calls it).    We had a lovely bottle of champagne to celebrate our great meal.

    "text": "Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro - A Haiku  Like Napoleon Surrender to the Ribeye Don't forget the wine  As with my previous reviews of other Vegas restaurants, please remember that most everything in this town is priced 10 to 1000 times what it should cost anywhere else in America. If your not ready for that, maybe Branson is more your style.   On to the Review!  On any occasion necessitating a gathering of men in Sin City, the \"Steak Night\" is usually the highlight of the trip. Its a right of passage for Gentlemen of Means. Red Wine and Red Meat. This trip was no different.   The meal began with a knowledgeable staff taking us on a tour of Australian vineyards. 3 bottles to be exact. Each complimenting a different portion of the meal. All 3 . . . EXCELLENT.   Morels is a la cart (like any fine steakhouse should be). For a man there is only 1 cut of meat that you are allowed to eat. That is a ribeye. Morels had several different rib-eyes. I went with the grass fed. It was excellent. I had it medium (as any man should do).   The table split 6 different sides, my absolute favorite being the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese. It was very good. My lease favorite was the mashed potatoes. They were simply average.   I concluded the meal with a cappuccino, some sambuca and the profiteroles. All delicious.   I don't want to take anything away from Morels. It was an excellent meal. Its just that for a Las Vegas steakhouse I expected more. There was nothing that made this place shine above several of the other places I have eaten. When you get together with your friends once every few years you expect the best. And this place is slightly below the best.",

    "text": "COLORED ONLY: Sat in what felt like the minority section of the patio which was the secluded darkened desolate corner area. This area probably wouldn't have been so bad, but this area also doubled as the smoking section for a family of Russians who decided to come out for a smoke while we were eating...not \"da harasho\" for us. So if this didn't make you feel like you were in the \"minority section\", I guess the lack of space heaters would. Every other table had at least one/two space heaters in the vicinity, but we got ZERO on a slightly nipple chill'n' night. When we asked Roger our server for one, he just responded with an off-the-cuff response that there weren't any space heaters (we're out of propane/not working). This would have been slightly tolerable, if we had just popped in unexpectedly, but we had reservations well in advance because this was for a bachelor party (also our tables and chairs didn't match the rest). The only way this was rectified, was luckily for us a food runner named Tommy took the initiative and went into action and GOT US A SPACE HEATER. I'm glad he stepped up, otherwise we would have just gotten left in the cold.   So why did we not get the attentive service we should have? Maybe our party looked young, and they didn't feel as though they had to go the extra distance, but whatever the reason, Roger didn't come through as he should have although I should say he was very professional in managing his ability to hold on to whatever tip he could hope for. Also his other assistant Mano (don't know the spelling) definitely did do a great job because he did most of the work (not a shock he was minority, haha). Of course, what should be said is that we were most likely just the recipients of bad service/management, but I throw it back to race and blame it on my  Filipino entourage.... Ok, all kidding aside, the moral of this story is that it's not necessarily race/discrimination, but sometimes its just crappy sub-par service whatever color you are.",

    "text": "I've never wrote a review before, but my experience at Morels was so bad I had to write one.  I was in a party of 10 people staying at the Venetian.  It was easy to get reservations, and we got seated promptly.  From there it all went downhill.  It took about 15 minutes just for the waiter to bring us menus.  After that, another 15 minutes to get water and order.  The restaurant was pretty empty at this point too.  After we ordered, we waited about another 15 minutes until we asked for some bread.  They decided to bring out the butter, but no bread.  15 minutes later, here comes the bread.  We finally get our steaks.  I ordered mine rare, and to be honest it was a little too rare, but it was still edible.  Someone in my party also ordered rare, and the steak was literally raw.  After eating about half of the horribly cooked steak, we finally had the waiter bring it back to actually get cooked to rare.  Get it back, it's still too rare.  So we sent it back again, and this time when it comes back they plate it on a small bread plate instead of the normal dinner sized plate.  So all in all, it took them three tries to cook a steak to rare, and it still wasn't cooked that well.  We were already pretty upset because the service had been super slow, and they couldn't cook a steak right.  Somehow, it gets even worse.  We get the bill and we all pull out credit cards to pay.  Morels isn't the cheapest place, we had to spend close to $80 a person for our steak and sides.  The waiter comes over to inform us that they can only have 3 credit cards on the bill.  3 credit cards?!  Are you kidding me?  At a restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian, where a steak costs at least $50, and you're going to tell us as we start to pay that you can only use 3 credit cards on the bill?  The reasoning?  They say it's not built into their software to be able to use more than 3 cards.  BS.  We had to ask for a manager.  The experience had just been horrible, and not being able to use as many cards as you want for the bill is inexcusable, especially for a more upscale steakhouse in a hotel where every other restaurant can take more than three credit cards.  How are they going to expect everyone to be able to fork out close to $100 in cash?  In a casino.  Where you could easily lose all of that money and only have a credit card.  We asked to speak to a manager.  The manager just stood there agreeing with everything we said, saying he's only been there for a month and that for some reason, he's able to put in 5 credit cards instead of the 3 that the waiter can do.  I'm not quite sure why he's all of a sudden allowed to use 5 instead of 3, when apparently it wasn't built into their system to use more than 3 cards.  Absolutely ridiculous.  All in all, the food wasn't that great, they couldn't cook a steak, and not splitting the bill to however many credit cards you want is absolutely ridiculous in a Las Vegas upscale steakhouse.  I'd give it a 0 star if I could.  Horrible, never coming back, and you shouldn't go either.  And the other thing, this review is probably going to get taken down which is a load of BS.  I know at least three other people in my party wrote a review telling about this horrible night, and Morels was able to delete it.  I might just save this copy and check every day and keep re-posting this review.  This place was that bad.",

I sent it back and when they came back with another it was bairly medium well.  The server made me cut it down the middle once the steak arrived to make sure it was \"medium.\"  bad move, it lost all it's juices immediately and like I said it was barely medium well, but at this point I didn't care anymore cuz I was so dam hungry.  But even for a medium well NY Steak this was exrtremely tough meat for something that's supposed to be \"Prime.\"  I've had better steaks from Sizzler and that's no exaggeration.  Whatever you do don't order the NY.  My friend ordered the filet and he had no complaints, and again the oysters were pretty dam good.   Like others have said, you can do much better in Las Vegas especially at this price point.",

    "text": "We decided to check out their breakfast here; although we were not staying at the Palazzo, I have stayed there before and it was absolutly fabulous. We came at the end of breakfast, around 1030am and so the restaurant wasn't that packed. In fast we were probably one of 10 tables there, and outside was closed since it was a bit windy. We ordered two cocktails, both of which were excellent, and necessary since when your in Vegas you are required (by law perhaps? :p ) to have a drink with every meal. My boyfriend ordered the french toast while I have the croque madam, I really liked my sandwich a lot but I have to say that my boyfriends meal was really what impressed me. The french toast was very nicely prepared and the flavors were off the charts, mine was a little heavy on the cheese for such a meal early in the day but that's mostly my fault since I knew it was quite the cheesy sandwich prior to ordering it. We had a $50 OpenTable gift certificate, so those always tend to ease the bill a little when traveling but still paid $70 out of pocket when all was said and done. I have to say for breakfast, for $120, it better be one REALLY nice breakfast, and although this was an excellent breakfast, the price really gives me pause. I believe this restaurant might have more to offer for their dinner menu, but if breakfast is going to run you this much I would expect the average dinner to two around $200-300 depending on what you ordered.  With this is mind, would I come back here...only probably with an OpenTable gift certificate, otherwise I would most likely choose a different place for breakfast. But I feel the 3.5 stars I would like to give, given the great drinks and food, can be rounded up to a 4.",

I don't think anything more needs to be said, a french bistro with soggy fries does not make sense.  The fish was good though, with the fish and chips, and there mussels were very good as was the oyster selection.  The wait staff is generally nice, the wine selection pretty decent for a bistro, However I can never get past the fact they can't cook a french fry.    Location is nice though, the dining room has really cool paintings and good music.",

Had to send back several dishes because we asked for medium rare and we got extremely rare! The worst part is upon sending it back, the returning dish was completely overdone! This is a steakhouse, how do you not know how to cook your steaks? We were the only party there practically. This place is mediocre at best when it comes to the other menu items, and the only reason this place is receiving a star is because they tried to remedy the problem and gave our whole table free dessert...which was not all too good either. Not worth the money, I would avoid this place if I were you",

When my then boyfriend made the reservations he asked for an intimate table. They sat us in a room off the main dining room in front of a window overlooking the strip! There were only about 4 tables in the room. It was the perfect place to pop the question, which is what he did and my now fiancee couldn't have done better! The food was very good. An appetizer of crab topped with caviar served on a thick rippled potato chip was actually my favorite! It was followed by a nice crab and bibb lettuce salad, a delicious scallop pasta with a white wine, garlic and shallots sauce and then a prime fillet and lobster entree. They ended our evening with sparkling glittered macarons served on a plate with a strawberry half and whipped cream complete with a sparkler to set off the New Year holiday. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the server was not very good. She seemed mostly bored, going through the motions, not at all impressed about the proposal and just ready to go home (not that I blamed her). Of course the best part was the amazing engagement ring!",

The beet salad was surprisingly light topped with vinaigrette and candied walnuts.  The salmon for my main entree was requested medium and it came out medium well and was a tad dry. The bed of asparagus was fresh though.  Meal ended off with a super delicious apple tart despite having a leather-like crust that was still super tasty after being able to cut it apart.

We started with drinks.  We could get anything we wanted with our package.  I had a nice sauvignon blanc.    We had a set menu which included:  COUNTRY VEGETABLE SOUP - Carrot, Zucchini, Kale, Potato, Onion, Celery, Vegetable Stock.  This was a nice hearty tomato based soup.  Good veggie chucks, nice flavor.  BOGGIATO FARMS BABY ICEBERG - House Dried Cherry Tomatoes, River Point Farms Red Onion, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Blue d'Auvergne Dressing.  This was a really delicious wedge salad.  Loved the dressing and cheese on top.  And you can't go wrong with bacon.  For entrees, we had three choices: HALIBUT PROVENCAL - Wine Braised Tomatoes, Preserved Lemon, Herb d'Provence, Crispy Potato BRICK COOKED SHELTON FARMS CHICKEN - Confit of Russian Fingerling Potato, Wilted Bloomsdale Spinach, Meyer Lemon & Caper Jus GRILLED 8 OZ. PRIME FILET MIGNON - Sweet & Savory Potato Galette, Provence Style Ratatouille, Sauce Bordelaise.  I had the steak.  It was cooked nicely, a little too pink for my taste, but very flavorful.  Loved the potato galette.    For dessert, we had: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE - Chocolate Toffee Cookie. This was delicious.  Very light, not too rich or dark.  Yummy!  The cookie was good too.  So overall a great meal.  Good service, good food.  Would love to come back and try the regular menu.",

I am giving this restaurant a 2 star because the service was very poor. Our group (four people) stopped here for lunch on a beautiful Friday afternoon. We were greeted by a not very happy hostess and then seated on the patio (per our request). The restaurant was not busy when we visited but the food came very late. I guess the lack of communication with the waiter is the whole problem. We understand that cooking food takes time, but checking in with costumers is vital in the restaurant industry. We saw the waiter very few times so when we needed extra stuff, we just went to search for them (salt, pepper). The person that picks up the plates, actually took my Bloody Mary even though I was still sipping - half of my expensive Bloody Mary!!  I don't think I will try Morales again since my experience there was not pleasant...",

    "text": "This place was a major disappointment. Five of us met for dinner on a weekday evening, two of whom came in from out of town. The expectations were high, particularly after downloading the menu beforehand.  To begin with, the menu I downloaded from their site was not current. At least three items I had interest in were not on the menu we were given. The table we were seated at was cobbled together with two tables, and where they met was uneven by a good inch. Reminded me of the cheap, neighborhood wedding and anniversary dinners when I was growing up: fine for then, not fine for a multi-hundred-dollar dinner.  The service was slow, except for our primary waitperson. She was very friendly and attentive, but it was clear some of that was making up for a lack of either of those traits in the other staff members. It was also noisy enough that we all had to lean in to hear her, and she was not whispering by any means.  As the first drinks and appetizers came, one of the waitstaff dropped a half bowl of soup on my back. It covered my jacket, sweater, shirt and actually got in the back pocket of my pants (Hey everyone, dinner's on me!). Things happen, for sure. I was a waiter many years ago. However, the success of a place is largely determined on how they handle incidents like this, and they did exceptionally poorly. My jacket was taken in the back to get inadequately wiped down, and the waitperson took a damp cloth to my sweater (which I had to finally take off), shirt and pants. None of these efforts were exactly successful. Once I got home - and in the glaring light of reality - it was clear there was a reason I was still experiencing a strong smell well after the accident. The solution to this problem? I was given the manager's card and told to bring them the cleaning bill. Any self-respecting McDonald's would've done the exact same thing. But the $400-plus we spent on dinner would've fed us for at least a week, not one meal. Big disconnect in understanding their relationship to the customer.  We all chose some sort of steak. Being in polite company, I'm damn sure that the reactions to the food were tempered. Everyone related the food was \"good\". Not one effusive, fawning critique. Make no mistake, for a $55-$75/ala carte dish price, at least one person at the table should've been gobsmacked.  All of the sides on the table were simply average. I got a Greek salad, which seemed to be modified just for the sake of modification. The overall balance was off, with flavors that were competitive and textures that were at odds. It was, honestly, just ... weird. I had a better salad the following day from Panera Bread.   My steak was, again, average. While cooked to order at medium rare, it simply didn't have flavor and texture I expected. The fries were actually below average, and the tea I had was exactly what I would get at any middle-tier restaurant: a box with an assortment of middle-of-the-road Twinings. Not at all appropriate.  Bottom line for me is, I'll never go back, never recommend, and won't even bother getting reimbursed for the cleaning. The entire experience was a waste of time, and I was unhappy our dinner guests had to endure all of this after such high expectations. Frankly, if this place was located off the Strip, they wouldn't last a year or two.",

    "text": "I may have given them a lower score but since we did not try the food I did not think it was fair. Also some of my frustration was not due to the staff in the restaurant. We wanted to eat at the Venetian so I went to the Venetian website to see what was available. It never mentioned that the restaurant was not in the Venetian but was in the Palazzo. So it was a 20 minute walk before we found the restaurant. My wife has several food allergies/sensitivities so we carefully reviewed the menu online to make sure there would be options for her.  My first issue: it was at least 5 minutes between being seated and our wait person introducing themselves. In any fine dining establishment that is unacceptable. There was no apology or even acknowledgement of this slight.  Second: the menu we were given was substantially reduced from the menu on the website. When the wait person finally returned to take our order. Which was Easily another 7-10 minutes with no drinks forthcoming. We questioned the difference in the menu and were told in an exceptionally flippant manner and with no apology whatsoever that there is a convention in town. As if that alone is the reason they would misrepresent their menu. I have been attending said convention for the last 9 years. I can tell you it was not a surprise. Nor has its dates changed. If the wait person was to be believed the entire staff and management were  completely caught off guard by this event. For their benefit I will say now that the SHOT show will be Jan 20-23rd in 2020.   When we mentioned my wife's diet restrictions and we based the decision to eat there based on what we assumed was the correct menu there was still no empathy/apology/acknowledgement. She asked \"what are her issues\" and when we explained there were many she stopped us cold and said she would send a manager over to take our order. It was readily apparent she could not be bothered.  We then chose to leave.",

    "text": "Morels was a great choice for Restaurant Week last year, so when a friend suggested it for a group birthday brunch, I rearranged plans to be sure to attend! Brunch menu is massive, with griddle, egg, and more lunch/entree options, as well as featured specials, where we found some of the best dishes.  The gratis beignet starter course was appreciated but not particularly enjoyed, I'd save my calories for a cappuccino. By far the favorite dish at the table was the imported mushroom souffle, which had a great rise and a rich Gruyere flavor in addition to the morels themselves. The Banana & Mascarpone-stuffed French Toast and Bananas Foster Pancakes were hits with those who favor sweeter breakfasts, but I tend to go more savory.   The classic BLT sando with added avo is served with a mountain of fries. The bacon portion is huge and perfectly crisp, but the pesto-mayo was a bit too subtle for my liking. I recommend getting extra on the side to dip your fries, too. The sandwiches in general are huge, and the French Dip another in our group got was massive.   If your entree is not enough food for you, adding on the French Onion soup is always a safe bet. If you're sharing, I suggest the \"Almost Famous\" Mac and Cheese, which had a great sauce and was amply portioned even without adding protein.  As for the dessert course, we had some technical difficulties with the Baked Alaska, which I did not care for but was enjoyed by others in our group.   Staff was fairly accommodating of our antics, and we had a great group table in the middle of the dining room, allowing for a view of the interesting selection of wall art featured here... to say the least. The souffle alone is worth braving the Strip on a Sunday morning, and as long as parking remains free at the Palazzo/Venetian property, I'll be suggesting this spot regularly.",

    "text": "Aside from concerns about what I actually ordered and apathy toward the complimentary app, I quite enjoyed this rare trip to a Strip restaurant.  I made my first visit to Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro for a Sunday brunch with Yelpers to celebrate Christie L.'s birthday. Morels is in the lobby of Palazzo and has patio seating, but we stuck to an indoor table. Perhaps others know of a different parking garage entrance, but I took the elevators nearest to the ramp at Palazzo, which is a short walk across the casino floor away.  We were seated promptly after about 7 of us had gathered (for a reservation for 10) and immediately set to trying to decide what to pick from the vast Summer Brunch menu. I stuck to water as my beverage, but others had coffee brewed in a French press or even a Bloody Mary. Maybe the coffee would've been wise after my bout of insomnia. It also seemed to pair with the complimentary \"beignets,\" which weren't all that fresh (judging from lukewarm temp) or enjoyable chewy.  My particular order was the Crab Benedict (billed as $20) with a side of Housemade Country Potatoes ($5). The potatoes didn't exactly go with the entree, especially if utilizing the side of ketchup, but they were filling, properly seasoned, and thoroughly cooked. The benedict itself was pretty decent, with two perfectly poached eggs on a thick-cut airy slice of brioche, and a creamy Hollandaise over it all. I could've done with more diced asparagus and a little more crab, and there were two bits of shell remaining in the latter.  My tablemates allowed me to taste some awesome stuff though. The Imported Mushroom Souffle ($15) came out billowing over the ramekin, and it tasted delicious. The Banana & Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast was even more delicious, with plenty of caramelization on the toast. The Onion Soup Gratinee ($10) was the last of three dishes that I'd confidently recommend off one bite. It was so cheesy and rich in caramelized onion.  The rest of the items could be worth a try, although they wouldn't be at the top of my list. I also liked the Bananas Foster Pancakes ($17), although the maple syrup outshined the bananas and pancakes.  The Almost Famous Mac & Cheese ($10) was enjoyable despite its simplicity. It was creamy and rich in cheese flavor. Last, but not least, the side of bacon ($6) was simple but thickly cut yet crunchy. I would trust their bacon based on this.  We shared the Baked Alaska ($14) for dessert. The waiter had some trouble lighting the rum, but we did get a waterfall of blue fire in the end. The rum flavor was easily found in every bite too, and the meringue, cake, and ice cream were pretty tasty.  Although my own entree was somewhat underwhelming, I would go back to Morels for a Strip-worthy special occasion brunch. Just make sure you're not with any puritanical party members or else they might be concerned with the wall decor, which prominently features a series of paintings of nude, paired figures of opposite sexes.",

But unfortunately when the meal finally arrived the fries were ice cold.  I told the waiter to just take them away, he did ask if I wanted another order but I said no.  The manager came over and told me he was going to replace them anyway and discount the meal.  Excellent customer service on his part, the steak was perfect and the replacement fries were great as well.  The manager deserves the highest praise this rarely happens.  I will definitely go back.

That happens, but what was unacceptable was that, as expensive a restaurant as this was, and with both a waiter and an assistant waiter, no one checked to see if the steak was cooked properly. For more than 15 minutes. It took calling over another waiter and asking for the manager before the steak was comped.   There are more good restaurants than I can count, and while Palazzo is amazing, this restaurant isn't.  I'd spend my money someplace else.",

We went for a birthday dinner and ordered the Dungeness crab meat cocktail, which was actually very good - nice blend of crab, celery, etc. We also got the tuna tartare, and that was underwhelming - the truffle potato chips were more reminiscent of Lay's ruffled potato chips, and the tartare wasn't particularly tuna-heavy, more of an even mixture of tuna, peppers and avocado, something you'd expect at a mid-level restaurant.   For dinner, four of us got filet mignons, one of them bone-in. The steaks were just fine; not as tender and buttery as what you'd get at a Ruth's Chris or a Capital Grill, just fine. They were good at cooking them to order, however.   One of us got the lobster and scallop spaghetti - the presentation was weird; it was served in a hollowed-out half lobster shell and looked like a pretty small serving for a $60 pasta dish.   For sides, we were dying to try the mashed potatoes with organic sea salt ... and were really disappointed. They were dry and very regular, not nearly as tasteful or creamy as you'd expect mashed potatoes at an expensive steakhouse to be. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts and the hand-cut fries; those were both really good actually, especially the Brussels sprouts.   They do have a solid wine list, and I thought the service was good - friendly, consistent, polite.   Overall, I can't say I would recommend this restaurant - it is much more expensive than the quality of food you get.",

IME the vast majority of the Strip restaurants tend to be soulless and robotic -- they're like machines where a big-name chef put his name over the door then left the local staff to dutifully crank out a set menu for mobs of tourists.  I'm used to having mediocre-to-meh-competent overpriced meals on the Strip.    At Morels, I was there mid-afternoon (in between shifts -- usually not a great time to get good food) -- yet the food was delicious and tasted like somebody had really been paying attention when they made it, not just doing it by rote.  Steak was high quality and correctly prepared.  Fries were delicious and hot fresh.  Side dish, salad, dessert, all good.  Good selection of wines by the glass.  Service was attentive.    I suspect the experience may vary depending on how busy they are.  I was there with only a handful of other guests....I tried to go back one evening and it was mobbed, mobbed, mobbed -- it's in the lobby of the Palazzo so an easy meeting place, esp when there's a conference with thousands of people at the Palazzo conference center.     That said, I'd go back in a hot second.",

Good service and banter from the male/female bar team.  Food came, ordered a glass of wine. Steak was a bit over temp but not enough to be objectionable... However the outside was charged to the point it was hard to cut thru.  The ends where the steak tapered down had enough of the crust that the burnt taste overwhelmed the good parts.  Sprouts were good.  Now that the food was dropped getting the bartenders attention was a fail.  Finally had a bar back order a creme brulee....at least 20 minutes elapsed before it arrived.  The custard was way over cooked and rubbery...to top it off it was tasteless.  Called it a night and got the check....umm $85 for a glass of wine....the bottle is only 16 or so more!

We were all wearing our jackets fully zipped with one person seated right by the door so his chair kept getting hit. I walked inside to ask to be moved but was told it was not possible. When we were served our steaks we were asked if we wanted to move but by that time it was a moot point. Service was rude as we were told off when our server came by with food and asked if we had the tenderloin and we said we had filet mignon and rib eye. He came back out and said these are your steaks i asked you about them 10 minutes ago. My $63 ribeye was not medium, but overly well done and basically inedible. This was a business meal and I was not going to make a fuss about the steak when so much was already going wrong. Terrible service, terrible food and for almost $600 for 4 people it was a complete waste of money.",

    "text": "I had not heard of Morels even though I had dined across the way at Lavo's. I ashamed to say it I had become a celebrity chef snob in this town.  It's easy to get wrapped up in all the hoop-la and forget what is at the core of eating out... the food.  I actually planned on having a rack of lamb at Delmonico's that night until I was convinced otherwise by my business associate.   Morels may not have the celebrity chef attached to their name but they don't need the hype. If you are a True fan of the dining experience, do yourself a favor and come here. The star of this location is you and the food that is presented exquisitely.   Maybe you're thinking I'm talking crazy bashing Ramsey, Emeril, Bobby Flay or any other of their likes. By all means that is not what I am doing because I enjoy eating in restaurants they attach their name and will continue to frequent their establishments. What I am saying is that Morels does it better in Vegas as far as I am concerned. Although who I am but a humble foodie who was privileged to meet executive chef Carrera who has been cooking for the owner for over a mere of oh 25 years.   His attention to detail in his plating, seasoning and selection of prime cuts doesn't grant him a TV show but it should.  His humble nature as he explained he approach to cooking makes him even more remarkable. Why you may ask? Well I'll tell you... His focus is on his craft not on himself. He lets his dishes speak for himself and not the other way around.   We were treated by the chef to a sample of Tuna Tartare, although it was only bite sized, it was a mouthful of delectable flavor. I knew this bite size treat was a good sign for things to come.   The Grand Plateau DE Mer was presented to the table and sadly since I'm allergic to shellfish, I could only enjoyed watching my dinner guests satisfy their palettes. It looked fabulous and the attention to detail was duly noted in the lobster. They take the time to extract the tender meat from the claws and carefully fold them whole into each half. The sauces stacked on top were seasoned to compliment the snow crab, shrimp, lobster and oysters. At least this was explained to me by those enjoying this dish. This is one that should be shared because it would be a feat to finish alone.   Although I was delighted to see how this dish was enjoyed by others my stomach began to be shellfish and grumble waiting for my entree. Yeah that was cheesy but at least I briefly laughed when I wrote it but I digress.  Finally my Colorado Rack of Lamb with a honey-mustard crust ordered medium rare arrived.  Ordered any other way would be a crime and a dishonor to this beautiful creature who sacrificed its life for my enjoyment.    A moment of silence please...   Ok moving on the lamb sit on top of a wine enriched rosemary bordelaise sauce that was not over-powering or too sweet.  Every bite was tender and it balanced well with the bread crust which drove the flavor home.  This is now the best lamb I have had in Vegas and my only regret is not trying it sooner than I did.  I paired this with potato dauphinois which is similar to scalloped potatoes just on a whole different level. The potatoes had this crusted on the outside from being in the oven and the center was soft from the creamy consistency of the sauce. All in all it was amazing and the portions were reasonable, I had room for desert.  I had, from what I remember because I was in a midst of a foodie comatose, the chocolate dome.  It was an amazing finish to a great meal.  If you can look past the hoop-la of the celebrity chefs, do yourself a favor and focus on what matters the most... the food.  Morels is sure to satisfy your every craving and then some.   By the way, if you were wondering my lamb was better than what I normally have in town at near by Delmonico's.",

The weather was beautiful so asked to be seated on the patio which can hold a decent amount of people and was empty except for a few other tables. The manager sat us at a table and told us that it was free for the next hour. Lol, what?!? Out of all the tables that were empty why would you sit as at at one that you need in an hour? Really rude. Our whole table ordered soup for lunch and we were not brought any spoons, we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to check on us and bring spoons, nothing. Finally we went inside and asked for some. Not a good experience and will not be returning, of all the amazing places to eat on the strip skip this one.",

    "text": "I can't imagine anything that would have made our experience at Morels any better. We were in Las Vegas for a weekend and wanted to have French food but didn't have the time or money for a really fine dinner so we opted for brunch. We debated between Bouchon and Morels but finally decided on Morels because they make Eggs Benedict, Bouchon doesn't.   There were four of us plus a little one. We sat at a beautiful round table and were treated like royalty from minute one by a friendly staff. They were complete professionals, keeping the table clean and stocked. First they brought us fresh beignets that were light and not overly sweet. We ordered French press coffee -- which was incredible and not the least bit gritty like the kind I make at home, espresso, a \"virgin\" latte for the kid, and handmade Bloody Marys. Oh boy, are these a treat! Seriously, these ALONE are worth a trip.  They bring out a cart full of fixings. Their own homemade tomato juice, hand grated horseradish, fresh chopped garlic, limes for squeezing, etc. Marcos, our waiter, talked us through the entire process of making the drink and graciously allowed three of us to copiously snap his picture. It was fun! The Bloody Mary was incredible. At $14, I don't know how they break even! I could have had three more. Yum, yum, yum.  Next, we ordered breakfast: Steak and eggs (with frites), a crab omelet (came with brioche), Eggs Benedict with crab, and French Dip -- mine. I thought the sandwich was delicious. Great bread, delicious sauce, perfect touch of cheese, tender meat. The frites were fantastic -- I tried them but got a salad instead. I heard rave reviews on the crab, very tasty and tender, and tried the omelet. It was amazing. So was the bread. Everything was delicious.  Overall, incredible time. Relaxed but our every need was attended to. We lingered and felt no pressure to go. Our bill came quickly when we wanted it. The timing on everything was perfect. Only one thing -- my guy's hashbrowns were not hot. He's big on HEAT. Marcos took them off his plate -- so he could still eat the omelet -- and got new ones made. Problem solved!",

When we arrived we found out the special was not available on the weekends (Sorry, but too bad). Canceled the reservation but decide to have a couple of drinks. Called the manager over and explained our issue. He said no problem \"I'll make it happen\"...and he did ! The food was great and the service outstanding and friendly. One of our party who did not have the special did not like her meal and was quickly offered another choice. The macarons for dessert were something special.

The French onion soup was good and had a tomato bisque stock to it which I enjoyed. Something different for a change. I had the mussels which were amazing in a white wine not over garlicky taste. My husband had the turkey avocado blt which was delicious. The avocado was perfect and the bacon was thick. Their drink variety, especially scotch is one of the best. We sat at the bar both times and each bartender was friendly and professional but down to earth. The managers that we spoke to because he likes to come out and get a vibe of what's happening is very professional and friendly. They go above and beyond at this establishment.",

A wide variety of west coast & east coast oysters which was great...... My husband had the porterhouse steak served over fingerling potatoes and veggies,,,, again GREAT!!!   So I would give it 41/2 but I opted for 5  The only 2 things that were not perfect was the decor... especially for Vegas and one of our 3 servers were a little uncomfortable... awkward.....

Or if looking for lighter fare, a croque Madame will do the trick with some fresh fruits. I am looking forward to returning and trying out the dinner menu.

He ordered it medium and it was more like medium-well. The edges were really dry and not much pink inside for such a thick piece of meat. Overall, it didn't taste great and most definitely not worth $60!! That's what the minus one star is for.. I expect amazing steak for $60...seriously I've had better top sirloin at Sizzler for $10. I ordered the crab omelet and it was nothing special. Okay, but really not flavorful. Just a simple omelet with crab in the middle -- oh and little pieces of crab shells --- wtf! Shells in a $19 omelet?!! Not okay. I don't recommend this place. Food is not up to par with the prices.",

Ceaser Salad at a steakhouse is a staple and at such a high end restaurant, i expected nothing but the best. However, the dressing had zero flavor and croutons seemed store bought and not house made. The complimentary rolls and olive tampenade were good. And service was great but not enough for me to recommend or come back.",

    "text": "Whenever I travel to Vegas I tend to gravitate towards the buffets and cheap eats. Why? Because I've always been afraid that the \"fancy\" restaurants are all show and no substance. That might be the case for some of the restaurants, but not with Morels. My wife and I ate dinner here on our last night and it was the perfect way to end the vacation. Service was impeccable (you have two servers) and the food was fantastic. We started with the three cheese sampler and told the server he could choose (they have way too many cheeses to choose from). He ended up bringing us a four cheese sampler as he was (his words) \"on the fence as to if you were going to like one of them.\" How nice! I then asked if he could split the $16 iceberg salad into two portions, \"no problem.\" The salad was beautifully presented like we had ordered two of them. For my main dish I had the 20oz bone-in rib eye. Yes it was $64 but it was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. Dessert? Nope, we were too full.  I had wished that we could have eaten outside on the patio but it was a little cool so we ate inside. No matter, the atmosphere is nice and they play a great selection of music. I'm sure we'll be back.",

We wanted a nice dinner for our bachelorette and they definitely made it very memorable. We had a beautiful secluded room with a chandelier to ourselves in the back.  The view overlooked the strip. The waiters were very attentive. They even serenaded our bachelorette! :)  The food was excellent too -- not too heavy. THe portion was small at first glance, but it was actually perfect in the end. We were full enough to be satisfied without going into a food coma.  I would recommend the beet and apple salad (the humbolt fog goat cheese is amazing in this salad.. melts in your mouth!) The steak of course was so delicious, juicy and tender. I'm salivating thinking about it.  The seafood fettucini and clam linguini... looked and tasted exactly the same except the seafood fettucini had more seafood other than clam. I don't know if they made a mistake, but the fettucini had the same exact sauce as the clam lingini.. which was more of a clear oil base sauce.  They were still both very good though, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars.",

Brunch rules, maybe better than Bouchon, which I'm sure is one of the best in Las Vegas.  Vast cheese selection, numerous brunch and lunch selections.

She actually be- littled/ argued with another server right in front of us, i felt so bad for the guy. she would not tent to our needs. And with the amount of money you're throwing down, you think it would be the best service ever!!! This was my first time, my friends before told me how great this place was... but it left a bad taste in my mouth, that i doubt I'll be returning for another time... if it wasn't for Luz V.

In the past we had always had excellent service and even better food. Our experience this time was extremely disappointing. The service was very poor. It took about 15 minutes after being seated to place a drink order and an additional 30 minutes to finally get the drinks. During that time I asked for the cheese appetizer menu which I never received. I also had to asked 2 times for the wine menu which I finally got after 15 minutes or so however no one ever came to ask for the wine order.   In the past Morels has provided some of the best steaks I've ever had. This time they were average at best and on top of that they were undercooked. We ordered medium and they came just barely rare. Will not be returning to Morels because there are too many other good choices in Vegas.",

His name was Jesus and he came over and introduced himself and took drink orders to start. The problem was he brought back the wrong drink for me, and his 5 oz pours were very stingy for the rest of my party. He told my gf that the beer she wanted they did not have and so he said he would get something else. We did not see him for another fifteen minutes and so we just grabbed another waiter who I asked to get me to get a different drink and order one for my gf. Also he took our orders. Jesus only showed after we got our new drinks.  Secondly, why this is a two instead of a three is the price. When I buy a $60 stake I want to know I'm eating a sixty dollar steak and sadly it was not up to that standard. If I paid $20 for it I think this place would deserve a three but for that price I was not blown away.  Overall, this place is so-so, and for the price you can find something that you will absolutely love some place else in vegas.",

The boys ordered steaks, which melted in your mouth. The corn was really good, and the macaroni and cheese sooooo good.

Wine selection fantastic, we had a bottle of the Hansel Pinot (one of the few under $100) and it blew everyone away.  The Stonestreet Upper Barn Chardonney on the Som's recommendation was fantastic as well.  It's not too noisy so you don't have to yell to be heard or keep asking people to repeat themselves.

    "text": "After wandering around the Palazzo looking at the menus of pretty much every restaurant there, my friend and I chose to settle in at Morels. Good choice!  It's a very classy place, with clean, classic decor, nice art on the walls, dim lighting. The modern glowing green Exit signs were the only thing that detracted from the very nice appearance of the place. Walking in you pass the fresh seafood on ice by the bar, and then their cheese area and charcuterie.  The cheese and wine menus are both extensive and both come from all over the world. I chose a glass of white wine to start. In order to save ourselves the trouble of picking out cheese, we just went with the cheese fondue (though they had a cheese expert that I'm sure would have been happy to help us with our cheese orders, had we asked). I'm quite happy with that choice, as the fondue was excellent.  The entrees were equally delicious. I had the brick chicken, which was incredibly tasty. It was probably the best meal I had on that trip to Vegas. My friend reported that his wet aged steak was very good as well. The frites with truffle mayonaisse were also good. If you are a steak connoisseur with money to burn, they have Japanese Wagyu steak for $185.  I was too stuffed for dessert so I didn't get to try that.  Despite having a 3-man team dedicated to serving us (and I counted 7 people that brought us food or interacted with us, excluding the hostess) the service wasn't quite as attentive as I would have expected. It wasn't bad by any means, but we had to wait a bit for someone to take our orders, and sometimes for water refills. It was certainly not enough to keep me from going back there.  Prices... well, it's Vegas, and a restaurant in a hotel on the strip. What do you expect? The prices were about on par with the location and the caliber of the restaurant.  One other thing, they have a nice patio area above the strip overlooking Treasure Island. Unfortunately it was a cool, extremely windy night so we didn't get to enjoy it.",

Although my husband and I were a bit early, we didn't get seated until 9:20.  It wasn't that the restaurant was busy, it's just that the staff were moving at their very own super-slow speed.  We were asked to be seated in the bar, which was perplexing when we could see that the restaurant was more than half-empty.  (And: half-empty on a Friday night? Bad sign!)  The bar staff didn't acknowledge our presence until the same second that the hostess was finally coming over to seat us.    The whole meal was uninspired, and service was glacially slow.  The cocktails were mixed by an amateur.  The appetizers were bland and plated poorly.  My petite filet mignon was also plated poorly: why was it just tossed onto a massive platter, instead of using a plate that was of a more appropriate size?  The steaks were well-cooked, although they weren't the superior cuts of meat that I had expected based on the price.  The pommes frites were nice, but the other sides were cold, and we couldn't find a server to actually do something about it.  The sommelier kept on recommending bottles that were twice as much as we had said that we wanted to spend (and really, it's not that hard to recommend a bottle of Bordeaux in the $250 range).  When we booked the table, we had been planning on having a cheese course and then apertifs and dessert.  We bailed on that after appetizers and mains took over two hours.    Go get a table at Bouchon.  Order cocktails.  Chat with the sommelier.  Order the steak frites.  Don't skip dessert.  Every single aspect of the Bouchon experience is miles better than Morels.  Bouchon is less expensive, the service is better, and the food is amazing.   Morels should be embarrassed to be in the same city, let alone the same hotel.",

I ordered a prime rib, but I am certain they brought me out a new york strip, even after the server tried to explain it away that it was a prime rib.

    "text": "Honestly, I wasn't expecting a whole lot - I promise.  We ordered the steak frites and croque madame.  Steak frites -  fries were good - the steak tasted like it was seasoned with taco seasoning.  I didn't know French food was seasoned with taco seasoning.  The meat was good - tender - juice - but tasted like taco.  The croque madame  was delicious.  It came with a side of homestyle breakfast potatoes.  What they failed to mention was that they put bell peppers in their homestyle potatoes.  One of us is allergic to bell peppers and so we had to send those back.  Luckily, they were kind about switching the potatoes for fries.  They did not remove anything from the bill.  What got my goat was they said they had a credit card processing had crashed and therefore would not be able to accept credit cards as part of the payment.  This restaurant is connected to the Palazzo and Venetian and has that open tab capability so that hotel patrons are able to charge their purchases to the room.  The way the waiter and manager presented the situation was that the whole hotel's system had crashed along with their own and so charging it to the room was not an option.  First, they could accept credit cards if they were manually entered.  Okay, one of us trekked back up to the room and got our discover card.  Then, magically the discover card could not be processed either when they tried putting it through.  Can you pay with visa or cash? No, no I cannot.  Are you serious right now?  We paid in cash - which is not something I wanted to do because that money$ was set aside for gambling not for paying for food that was supposed to be charged to my room or my credit card.  I call the hotel guest services to see if there's an issue with the whole system at the hotel - guess what- NO IT'S NOT!!  It was just the restaurant's malfunction.  Had I known that - I WOULD HAVE NEVER STAYED - why would you misconsTrue the situation - making it seem like it is the whole system in the hotel and not just your restaurant?  That's some shady business.  You made me resent my whole dining experience because I felt bamboozled into eating at a place that was going to give me glorified tacos and allergic reactions - then make me feel bad for not wanting to pay cash because their system is broken.  Blah - not worth a return visit.  Buyer beware !",

At brunch, you can get the ambiance (we sat outdoors on the patio) and great food, without paying the high price. Our table had the kobe beef burger and the french dip sandwich. Everyone raved. I'd say it was one of the better burgers I've ever had because the meat was just sooo good. I definitely recommend this place, especially for brunch or lunch. Enjoy!",

They were delivered to our table with no explanation. There were three sauces that we navigated with no help from our waiter. Our steaks were prepared well but the Mac & cheese side was flavorless and the artichoke was overcooked and oversalted. The crab served with my filet oscar tasted a bit rancid. Our waiter was annoyed when we asked about the salts delivered with my husbands steak. We received far superior service from the support wait staff. We had a very good Pinot Noir, vantage point. Not worth a third of the $333 bill. This is my first negative review and I regret not reading the yelp reviews prior to making a reservation.",

It's nice to be able to get dolled up and arrive at the restaurant without having to take a taxi (especially since it was about 100 degree outside!!).   We started off with a cheese platter. We told the self proclaimed cheese monger the various cheeses that we liked and he brought out a selection of 6 cheeses that he thought would match our tastes. I actually only liked 1 of the cheeses - it tasted like parmigiano reggiano (LOVE). However, everybody else at my table seemed to love the cheeses.   As for our entrees, we decided to share multiple dishes, family-style. We ordered the halibut, filet, bone-in ribeye, the linguine special and a side of truffle mac and cheese. My favorites were the linguine and mac and cheese, of course, as I am carb lover extraordinaire. The halibut was well cooked, but lacking in flavor and the steaks were comparable to say.. a Ruth's Chris, with a 20% mark-up.  All in all, good meal with great company. I love how my girls can eat a big steak dinner before going clubbing. That's how we roll.",

I intended to go to breakfast but since breakfast service ends at 11:00 am I had to settle for lunch. We dined inside. It was very pretty inside but kind of dull since there were only a couple other diners. The steak frites and fish and chips were excellent. Service was very attentive. I returned a month later early enough to catch breakfast. I had the banana stuffed French toast. It was perfect, crispy on top and soft inside. My party also enjoyed the seasonal fruit, with a side of bagels and organic bacon. The fruit was fresh and came with vanilla yogurt to dip. The mini bagels had a wonderful chive cream cheese spread. The bacon was crispy. Again, delicious food and great service. This time I also sat outside facing the south strip. I found this to be way more lively and fun than sitting inside the restaurant so I'd recommend doing that. Even though it is summer outdoor seating provides plenty of shade so we were very comfortable the whole time. Thank you Morels!",

    "text": "If you've ever been to Morels in Los Angeles at the Grove, you'll be suprised.  Morels in Vegas is much bigger in every way, from the menu to their digs in the relatively new Palazzo hotel on the Strip.  The service (crappy attitude, but more on that later) is generally good and so is the food.  I would say the food is actually very good.  Be sure to try their steaks and seafood.  All that said...... Yes,  I am the asshole that is going to give this place a one star.  Was it one bad night?  Probably.  In this case I'm just not going to forgive.  I'm taking the contrarian, glass half empty view, they-didn't-care-about-me-so-fuck-you kind of attitude.  I've been to plenty of great places, and I'm a great customer to those that \"get it\" and know how to serve, especially when they charge top dollar.  I was there with a total of three people.  All of their wait staff seemed to be pretty responsive, and attractive to boot.  Our waiter was charismatic.  Too bad we didn't have a female.  At issue is that my friends and I were going to order entrees with a little bit of an appetizer to get us going.  And that's where our waiter came in.  He basically started **selling** us on the big appetizer platter.  That it'd be good, it'd be perfect for the three of us, that we'd enjoy it... A real sell job.  It got to the point that I started thinking, I wonder what I can afford as a monthly payment... And where do I sign the lease papers before this dumbshit has to go back to \"talk\" with his \"manager\"?  It was THAT bad.   We thought, fine. Let's get past this.  It's generally good to trust your waiter for recommendations, right?  We go for the appetizer platter.  The sommelier stops by to assist with their very extensive wine list.  Again, a sell job.  The sommelier is having us go through the $400+ list.  This guy is selling pretty hard.  We instead go for a bottle from the regular list that's a little lighter on the wallet.  Appetizer comes in on a cart with three waiters to set it up.  Holy shit!  Appetizer alone is a frickin meal and a half.  All great quality, but just complete overload.  Since we trusted the waiter on his advice, we do courteously inform that it was just too much.    His response?  Eh, that sucks.  Just eat as much as possible.    So we struggle through the massive appetizer platter.  Then our main courses come.  Again, fantastic food, but just WAY too much.    As we're going through the meal, the armies of wait staff zoom by our tables.  I overhear from a few, how they sold this expensive dish or that bottle of $1,000 alchohol.... So everything put together I'm thoroughly pissed.  I'm feeling like we were completely fleeced by this waiter.  Food was really good though, we just had nowhere to put all of it.  The waiter had the nerve to ask us about desserts after we had made it perfectly clear throughout the meal that the food quanitity was insanely too much.    And the bill for three, all in with gratuity ended up being a little over $600.  My advice if you do come here:  1)  Know the menu beforehand and what you want to order, 2) Don't get fucked by the waitstaff's \"advice\".  They're in it to make a buck, not take your dining interest to heart.  Bon appetit.",

    "text": "2.5 stars.  I had high hopes for a great steak dinner at Morels, given that this very upscale restaurant is located in the fairly new and decidedly fancy Palazzo.  A few years ago I had one of the best restaurant steaks ever at Delmonico in Palazzo's little-sister hotel the Venetian, so I think it's reasonable to expect even better quality from the higher-end hotel.  Unfortunately, in my case the experience fell well short of my expectations.  We were seated quickly at around 7pm, at which time the dining room was relatively empty and a large crew of servers stood at the ready.  The room itself is fairly low-key and classy, with interesting art hanging on the otherwise plain walls.  I like the decor, but I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more design effort.  The front part of the restaurant where you come in features what looks like an oyster bar with a dark wood theme, and I wish they had carried that aesthetic throughout the rest of the dining room.  As it stands, you'll spend your evening staring at relatively unadorned light blue and white walls and large view windows facing the Strip.  Our waiter was quite chatty and informative, giving plenty of suggestions and lots of insight into Morels' impressive cheese and oyster menus.  My buddies and I were in fact very satisfied with the cheese and oyster plates that we ended up ordering as appetizers.  Morels also offers an extensive wine list, with a varied selection of wine styles spread across a wide range of price points.  However, one thing that bugged me just a little bit was the nature of their wine service.  Morels keeps a sommelier in their employ, but this person doesn't bring out the wine list to help you make your selection.  Instead, you choose your bottle, and then the sommelier appears with the bottle and pours it for you.  When your glass gets low, he swings by your table and tops you off.  Now I'm all for sommeliers, but wouldn't it be better if he showed up earlier and guided you through the wine list, helping you make a pairing based on the food you order?  I'm a wine novice so I certainly would have appreciated the help.  As I said, not a huge complaint, just kind of odd.  So onto the entrees, and here is where most of the stars got deducted.  First of all, the food took a while to show up.  Of course, this is pretty typical for a fancy restaurant, but by the time our wait started to feel long, the room hadn't really filled up yet.  That said, I am generally willing to give the kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt.  When our sides failed to arrive with our steaks, and none of the many servers carrying the steaks acknowledged that we had even ordered sides, my mild lack of enthusiasm turned to full-on disappointment.  We tried to wait out the 10 or 15 minutes as our sides were hurriedly prepared and brought out; they turned out to be pretty decent.  The steaks, however, were really, really average.  They were cooked to temperature and had nice marbling, but they tasted plain and unseasoned, with hardly a trace of that meaty flavor that a $50 dry-aged steak ought to have.  It was the first time in many Vegas steakhouse trips that I contemplated using the dipping sauces.  To cap off the meal, I ordered my customary espresso for dessert and it turned out pretty poorly; all evidence pointed to old coffee beans.  All in all, the dining experience was mildly enjoyable, but heavily marred by the deeply unimpressive entree.  For the same price, I've had much, much better experiences (and steaks) at Cut, Mesa, and Delmonico.  Sorry, Morels.",

Our server, friendly and attentive, gave us several delicious fromage recommendations to accompany our charcuterie platter.  Four of us decided to share our meals, of which we decided on the Petit Cut Filet Mignon, the Bone In \"Eye\" of the Rib Eye Steak, the Halibut special, and Seafood linguine, with sides of truffle mac & cheese and sauteed green beans in foie gras butter. Everything was so delicious and we weren't even able to finish it all. The meats were tender and flavorful while the seafood was fresh and very delicate in texture and taste. The accompaniments were rich and ever so buttery good. I ate more than I should have and was very happy to be wearing my non-form fitting dress that evening.   At $86 per person, for one cocktail, appetizers, and one meal per person, split 8 ways for 9 girls is not bad at all. The food was heaven, the dining experience was enjoyable and what locked in our 'large party' reservation was that we weren't subject to a pre-fixe menu, just because our group was larger than 6 people.   Morels was friendly, personable, accommodating and lent their establishment to us for a great meal. I would come back for a second visit for sure.",

We finally settled on Morel's, getting seated right away on the patio at a table for four.  The patio was a bit loud due to the TI Sirens show going on, and our table was small, but it was nice to be outdoors right on the strip.  Three of us started with the shrimp cocktail appetizer, which was four huge, delicious shrimp for $12, I believe.  All four of us had the filet, which was slightly overcooked for our preferences, but was delicious nonetheless.  The service was fairly attentive, but nothing out of the ordinary.  With so many steakhouses in Vegas, I wouldn't plan a specific trip to this restaurant, but if you find yourself at the Palazzo, it's a more than adequate option for dinner.",

    "text": "Morels, I woke up early to catch your tasty brunch menu.   I figured I'd wake up before the rush.   We were just at Bouchon the day before this breakfast... granted we hit the peak of lunch time and our waitress was super nice in trying to salvage the deal, but I now believe Bourdain in his comment of \"high class fast food for a price\". Of course after that disappointment I was almost hesitant to shell out some more cash just to be deceived by the glitz and glam of Las Vegas strip restaurants.   But ok, I couldn't help it. The organic eggs and sides woke me up and dragged my two limbs downstairs to fill my empty stomach.     Came in and the hostess seemed unorganized, but it did take her only five minutes to get our party of five in a comfortable round table In the middle of restaurant.  Decor was very modern and almost sensual in a good way.   I can see how the colors, and the moldings would work beautifully at night with dim lights and not so dragging with a hangover look during the daytime.   Our waiter was great and knowledgeable to a degree.   Coffee selection, I would almost say limited... but then maybe I'd have to correct myself on that one.  It was actually a well chosen selection of the average and exotic brew or should I say press.  Our waiter suggested Rwanda on a French press and it was definitely a cup worth waking up earlier than high noon in sin city.   I thought my order was good, I opted for the crab benedict which was prepared clean and tasty as expected.   But from the whole meal, one thing that was unforgettable was the side of organic ham. Oh that tiny bite of organic ham... I'd like to order a whole hind of it and make it my pillow.   That was by far the juiciest ham I've ever tasted.   That ham will take out your Grandma's holiday ham anytime. Yes, that's right, I'm talking sh$t about your Grandma's dry, chewy and overly sauced ham.   Morels may have to share their secret with me here, becuase that one was perfect. It was salty, sweet, juicy, plump, not chewy, and seared properly on all sides.   And so, I can say that Morels offered me and my party a True hearty breakfast.   I just wish for next time they can deliver me a breakfast in bed.  Hey, it is Vegas...  you never know.",

    "text": "Morel's was our brunch destination on a recent Vegas outing, and it did not disappoint.  In fact, I'll be here again on my next trip. Here's what we had:  Banana stuffed French toast - two layers of hearty brioche with bananas in between. Very good but I thought the brioche was a bit dry; fortunately the cinnamon, maple, and copious amount of bananas made up for that. This is actually a good dish for sharing as you could separate the two layers of toast without make a huge mess.  Grilled chicken and proscuitto panini - Excellent. Bread has a perfect crisp and the melted-cheese-to-protein ratio  was spot on. Came with a hefty serving of frites which were delicious and salty (how I like them).  I washed everything down with a bloody mary, which they make at your table to your specifications. I ordered mine ridiculously spicy with Grey Goose. Best damned bloody mary I've had in recent times and worth every penny.   Service: outstanding and worthy of a higher tip. The tableside-crafted bloody mary was in a service league of its own.  (My rating scale: 5-Outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-Very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-Decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-Disappointing. 1-A waste of everyones' time.)",

Although I've never tried the LA version, but we had a plethora of different foods ranging from the cheese and bread to the lobster and steak.  The decor was nothing to wow you, which is odd considering how new of a place it is and it being in Vegas, but from a French steakhouse it was contempoary yet understated, if that makes any sense. Also I'd note that the service was impeccable, but then again I was with a high roller.",

    "text": "We found this place on Opentable as a last minute reservation before a show and it was one of the best decisions we've ever made.  I dont know what the low raters are talking about - if you dont appreciate fine dining...go to freaking Denny's - its likely a better fit for you.  We had 5-star service and the menu/wine list was above excellent. There is something for everyone and every price range on the menu - and you'll have a hard time deciding between the seafoods, steaks or poultry.  We started with the French Onion Soup which was excellent. A much bigger portion I would expect for a starter (be cautious of this..it almost filled us up before dinner) and I had the 18-hour slow braised beef rib (OH MY GOD!!!!!) and Hubby had a barramundi fish special (awesome)  I dont normally eat meat (I'm a Flexitarian) but was tempted by the Slow Braised Short Rib which is rare. I can never eat red meat ever again, as it will never compare to the pure perfection that was this dish. You touch the meat with your knife (which short ribs will usually vary from tender to like a shoe) and the meat fell apart. The sauce was mind blowing and I couldnt get enough.  The whole barramundi thing with my husband was quite comical to us. The waiter looked at us with our funny accents and treated us like we were a tad too 'common' for his eclectic tastes. He gave us the whole 'lesson' on Barramundi fish and we told him we love barramundi as we are Australian and its an Australian fish - we grew up on the stuff.  He insisted we were wrong it was a New Zealand fish and also corrected us on how to pronounce it - 'barra-mooooon-dey' (its an aboriginal word.. trust us, we know how its pronounced and that wasn't it) So we spent much of the meal saying Barramundi in sentences just to watch the steam come out of his ears. He was a slightly pretentious waiter - but they are the best kind. He knew his menu and his wines and his service was excellent. Just a small case of 'pole-up-butt' syndrome.   Another small touch I LOVED and which sometimes goes unnoticed: Hubby and I were dressed up as we were about to go to a show - the waitress who seated us automatically looked at what we were wearing and swapped our napkins to black ones. I hate getting white napkin fluff on my black clothes. It was an extra winning touch.  They had a fine range of after dinner wines and grappas, but I couldn't fit any more in which I regret. I really wanted to try some of their great cheeses they had on display in their cheese room. We will definitely be going back again.",

We sat outside in the shade since it wasn't hot yet and we had a good view of Las Vegas Blvd.   Basically their menu has a lot of typical brunch items. I got eggs and smoke salmon crepe and it was really good. The portion was big. My friend got the stuffed french toast (with marscarpone cheese inside) and it was kinda small and kinda watery inside. Another friend ordered the pancakes and you get 5 in the order.   The prices are kinda high but that's expected for a restaurant in The Palazzo. Honestly you can find a cheaper and better brunch than this place. The food was good but not worth the prices.",

Beautiful atmosphere, but the wait staff was slow and indifferent.

Out of the list of places to eat, Morels stuck out to me.  I decided to make the online reservation and get ready for an adventure.  Palazzo is a beautiful hotel in the heart of the strip, and Morels is the perfect restaurant there.  Its decor is sexy and chique, using black and white with hints of wine, and very sexy paintings on the main wall.  As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by two lovely ladies who sat us indoors near the windows.    Our server was more than helpful, and as usual I asked for suggestions for lunch.  He brought out the dinner menu because their steaks are always available, and I went with their 100% Kansas raised bone in new york, medium.  For starters we had a charcuterie of  proscuitto and salami, complimented with 3 types of cheeses: a blue cheese blend of goat and sheep milk, as well as a brie and capricorn.  It arrived with some walnut cake slices, fresh honey comb, walnut spread, as well as a mini baguette sliced to eat, grain mustard, mini pickles and pickled onions.  All of it was savory, beautiful, and incredibly wonderful to eat.  With the steaks we ordered mushrooms sauteed in truffle butter, along with pomme frites with an out of this world truffle mayonnaise made in house.  All of the food was heavenly.  First, the cured meat was freshly sliced nearby, and we watched the chef slice it deli thin along with the cheeses.  He was meticulous with the plating despite it being a casual appetizer.  The cheeses were fabulous.  I am not a blue cheese person, but I will eat that blue cheese we ordered every single day if I could afford it.  The honey comb along with the walnut cake was amazing, as was the other two cheeses we ordered.    As for the steaks--I couldn't be happier.  The carry over made the steak the perfect medium that I desired.  With nothing but salt and black pepper to season, as well as a teaspoon of herb butter on top, it was thick, juicy, and worth every penny.  The side dishes weren't just side dishes--they were meals in themselves!  Mushrooms were just the right texture and seasoned well, and the pomme frites were the best I've had in Vegas.  I love a good fry, but when you add a dipping sauce like a truffle mayo that they make, it's to die for.  I wanted to smother it on everything.  I could taste the hint of lemon zest and black pepper as well.  It was fantastic.  We ended the lunch with their signature souffle.  I've had one before at Wolfgang Puck's, and it was fair. This, however, was incredible.  Soft, fluffy and light as it should be, the dessert itself wasn't overpowering and because they used premium cocoa, the sweetness was well balanced.  Their vanilla bean sauce was so good.  I wanted to lick the plate when I was done.  Overall, a great meal at under 200 dollars.  Well worth the price tag.  In Vegas, it's easy to spend a lot of money at a restaurant that serves mediocre food.  Morels, however, is worth every penny.  Make the trip.  It's worth the time.",

We ordered the following: - Salad Nicoise - Very tasty salad with seared ahi tuna, green beans, potato chunks, anchovies, quail egg (halved), olives, heirloom cherry tomatoes and tossed in a lovely vinaigrette - French Onion Soup - Now, that's what I call FOS! It comes in a small ceramic pot bubbling with the cheese melted over the bread on top of the oniony soup. Very delicate flavor and not at all salty. - Mushroom & Lentils Soup - Soup of the Day - soft lentils with mushrooms - dad liked it! - Mushrooms and Gruyere Crepes - 2 huge crepes smothered with creamy mushrooms. So delicious! - Short Rib Sandwich with green salad - very tasty short rib that you can cut with a fork! - Fish & Chips - Beautiful fish cooked in a light batter with home made yellow tartar sauce. Chips are thin strips of potato deep fried. Our order was a little slow in coming out after the soups came out. After waiting 25 minutes or so, our waiter finally reassured that our entrees were coming out. Most of the dishes that were leaving the kitchen were breakfast plates. Ours was more of lunch items. When we paid for our bill, I noticed that our tea for my mum had been comped! That was nice! Will definitely come back to Morels and taste what else they have to offer.",

Ordered the beef tartare. Much better. But again didn't seem fresh nor tasted fresh. Very sad and unhappy with both products.  Quail egg was laid to the side and presentation was atrocious.   Was then told the rillette was available which I got and was excited again. However, the rillette was bland dry and flat.   Overall I was very unhappy with the food.

The last one is not something I enjoy, but that's just how it is in Vegas. At Morel's, high prices was the only expectation of mine they met.   Let's start with ambiance: Nothing luxurious, fancy, or pretty about it. Boring.   Food: All average and pretty tasteless. Not worthy of the prices whatsoever. We were a party of 14 (3 of them being kids) and not one person liked their food. At a price tag of over $1500, that's a sucky way to start a Vegas trip. My salmon was dry and tough, the steaks undercooked and flavorless, and the sides extremely flavorless. Even the mac and cheese just tasted like pasta off the kids menu with some butter and Parmesan.   Service: A huge disappointment. The busboys were extremely attentive with refilling waters so there's a plus. The hostesses were straight up mean and were gossiping about us, in front of us. Um you're a restaurant not bouncers at a club. You should be pleasant. Our waiter was incredibly rude and just didn't seem to care at all. 2 seconds after I ordered my cocktail I decided I wanted wine. Annoying I know, but it was a quick change of heart. The waiter pretended to check with the bar and said they already made the drink. How do we know he pretended? We saw him!!! Not a huge deal, but lots of little things like that plus a rude attitude and it equals no beuno service.   Overall, not recommended. Much better out there.",

And we wait more than 20 minutes for the bread when he told us it's on the way. We order 6 special 4for $45 and pasta from kid's menu. When kid almost finish her pasta, they delivered 2 plates of 1st course. We asked aren't we suppose to have 6 of it. Their answer was they had combined them. We asked the manager  to show us how to put it back to 6 plates because they had only 2 pieces of each cheese on each plate and we have 6 people. Manager Jerry tried very \"hard\" and only sent 5 plates back and 1 of them was without meat.  We lost all appitize and ask Jerry's \"permission\" to cancel all orders  and left the place.  How can Palazzo allow such a low end service restaurant there? Never heard any French restaurant will \"combine\" first course without even let us know first.  There is a reason when everywhere else was full and there was not too many guest there.  It explained.",

    "text": "Overall not bad at all. Need a little improvement here and there.    Petit Plateau De Mer - 4 Shrimps, 6 Oysters, Octopus Ceviche, Dungeness Crab - FRESH. It's the seafood freshness that you can't describe. The octopus ceviche was very disappointing tho - didn't even touch it after tasting it.   Crab Oscar Benedict - served on a non-traditional bread, but wasn't bad. I almost prefer this bread instead of the traditional English muffin.   Mussels Marinire - Mussels, Garlic, Shallots, White Wine sauce, side of fries.  The fries soaked in white wine sauce with garlic and shallots made this dish.  However, the mussels were over cooked, the shells were broken and dried out, and the mussel were shriveled.  Since it was over cooked, the white wine boiled away leaving less sauce to enjoy.  So the best part of it, the sauce & fries, was short lived.  If they cooked it just right I'd come back for this dish.  Service - nothing spectacular. They didn't neglect you but they didn't go above and beyond.   I hate to give them 3 stars but it wasn't a solid 4 star restaurant.",

    "text": "We had $150 credit at The Palazzo so we used it towards Morels. I'm not a big fan of French food because I've had bouchon and mon ami gabi here in Vegas and both was really bad. No flavor and oily. I decided to give this place a shot with no expectations and it wasn't as bad as I thought.   I had lunch here with my boyfriend and his parents, so we ordered family style.   Nicoise Salad- first time ever trying a French salad and this was so good. The Nicoise salad had seared yellowfin and anchovies with quail egg dressed with summer vinaigrette. I was completely taken by surprise and it was way better than my Cobb Salad. 4/5  Flat iron steak & frites. Frites are fries, just a fancier way of saying it I guess. They were fried to crisp perfection and not too overdone. Steak was surprisingly good. Not the best but not bad coming from a French spot. It was a light season of a simple recipe of rosemary and salt and pepper with a nice tender. 4/5   Seafood Platter- west coast oysters, dungness crab claws, and humongous cocktail shrimp. Great appetizer if you're willing to dish out for it. Oysters were okay.. Not sweet as I expected since it's suppose to be. Other than that, everything else was delicious, even the Italian aioli they made in house for the crab was great. 4/5  Seared Scallops with Cous Cous- perfectly Sears scallops. Light white butter sauce. Not a fan of Cous Cous though. Scallops would've been good either by itself or accompanied with a greenie.  3.5/5  Seafood Fettuccini- light pasta dish. Clams, shrimp, mussel, garlic, and Chardonnay white sauce. My Boyfriend didn't like it because he likes creamy based sauce. This dish isn't meant to be like those heavy Italian dishes. Not bad but not omg good.  3/5   Cobb Salad- huge portion. Couldn't finish. But the dressing had WAY too much vinegar. 2/5   Overall this place was good. But if it weren't for the $150 Credit, i wouldn't come back because it's really expensive.",

    "text": "It just did not impress at all. For $140 bill for two I expected much better from a French restaurant.   The place was nearly empty on Sunday at 9pm. This should have meant better, more consistently attentive service, but no. It took a good 5 minutes for our server to show up with the menus. Take queue from Denny's and have the hostess give the menus to the clients - it works! Our server was ok, but I felt she did the bare minimum in checking on us and being friendly.   After a little while the attentiveness improved by the assistant waiter who would refill our beverages on time and without us asking.   Now on to the food. It was OK. Not bad but not great either. We had mussels and the halibut, and did not find either to be anything special or with some unique twist that would leave a lasting impression. The potato dauphinois side lacked seasoning, and was underwhelming.  The $37 dozen of oysters was fresh and delicious.   With so many restaurants in Vegas, having a restaurant with many mediocrities is a sure way for another more 'hungry' competitor to take over and wow the patrons.  Unfortunately for Morels, it needs improvement in consistency across many departments to stave off the hungry competitors. Otherwise we are sure to see some new eatery open in its place soon.",

Our food was average at best, I decided to order dessert as I had been looking forward to it all week. The Creme Brule with chocolate mousse was recommended to me.

However it was the Bacon and Tomato risotto that totally won me over. I make risotto all the time at home (it's my thing if you will) and heaven knows I've had bad risottos at restaurants. I recognize it's hard to pull off in a restaurant setting. But that's what made the following so spectacular.  Let me just say this is one of the better risottos I've ever had. Sticky, smoky bacon, heirloom tomatoes that exploded like delicious firecrackers in your mouth and that finish of fresh basil was to die for. If I had one complaint it was that the fava beans almost seemed lost, but not enough to make me regret this dish at all.  Service was good. Good food and a relaxed atmosphere make this a good place to eat if you're in the mood for a steak or a delicious risotto (if they still have it).",

My family came here for a quick fondue with some drinks before going to the pool or heading out to the strip. We LOVE fondue and were salivating at the idea of a fondue appetizer. We ordered it for three, and three proseccos.   The fondue was pretty bad. I mean, it was cheesy, but it tasted like a cheese sauce more than an authentic fondue. Even worse, the bread they gave us had NO crunch at all. It seemed like a white loaf that had been sitting there or not baked to a crisp.   We ran out of bread and asked for some different crispier bread, and he brought back baguette pieces. They looked great, but upon touching them I realized they were also soft. No crunch at all.   For 30 dollars for the fondue, it was a total let down. If you love fondue, please don't order this. I've had fondue in a lot of places, including Switzerland, and this is a joke of fondue.   Prosecco was good, service was good, and decor was good... But at a place like this, expensive ish food shouldn't be so 'meh'",

I wanted a beet salad and tried their version with prosciutto.  While I was waiting for my salad, they provided me with their bread which was really good.  The rolls were served warm and had a thin skin with a nice, fluffy interior. The butter was soft as well and easily spread on the bread.  I had never had prosciutto with a beet salad but it worked really well.  There was a nice mix of flavors with the sharp taste of the blue cheese blending well with the savory prosciutto with the acidity of the balsamic dressing.  They also had some beans for texture which I think works really well with beet salads in general.  The golden beets were sweet and tasty, but they could have added more beets for color and balance.  My server was attentive and friendly and service was great overall.  The price was $21 including tip and was good value considering the quality here.  I will have to try the dinner options the next time I am around.",

    "text": "Having twice visited Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro for Brunch, once long-prior to calling Las Vegas home, it was as a party of four that dinner was finally sat down to on Saturday, the Bar area hopping for a special Wine event while the grand dining room sat approximately half -full with a wide range of patrons.  Toqued by Chef JL Carrera and now the brand's flagship after deciding to opt-out of their lease at Hollywood's Grove, a recent menu overhaul adding some lighter choices to old favorites including plenty of Beef and Cheese, it was with reservations confirmed that guests were led to a rounded table at room's center, the wait-staff all well-dressed and professional as Water was filled while diners weighed the options.  Known best for their Fromagerie and Strip-facing patio, the weather unfortunately a touch too cold for the latter this evening, it was after a Cocktail order was placed that Bread arrived with Butter and Olive Puree, an Amuse Bouche quick to follow featuring Peaches and fresh Burrata drizzled in Vincotto.   Low-lit and modest in volume, nicely padded seats beneath high ceilings giving the space a \"Big\" Steakhouse feel while risque paintings add a certain charm, it was no more than fifteen minutes before space was cleared in anticipation of three Appetizers, a Martini glass of Ceviche pairing nicely to the Tequila-based Mentirosa while Tomato Soup with a touch of smoke and hidden Cheese ball was big enough to share, as was Morel's Classic Cheese Fondue that was ordered \"for two\" at $10 per person but large enough to serve four or more.  Mindful to not overdo it with melted Cheese, the fact that sliced Bread ran out with at least another quarter-cup remaining probably a blessing in disguise, it was with serviceware re-set that a brief wait preceded the arrival of entrees and sides, the whole table soon filled and most diners starting off their plates with sides including roasted Sprouts with salty Pork and Balsamic, extra cheesy Noodles dubbed \"Macaroni\" but not really and multi-layered Potatoes Dauphinois that would not have been out of place in a formal French Restaurant.  Not particularly sold on Onion Rings' $9 price tag, a cost of nearly two-dollars each unjustified by size or quality in compared to the national chains, it was thankfully Meat and Pasta that performed far better, the Short Rib presented sort of like Pot Roast and delicious save for a few spots overwhelmed by Bacon while handmade Rigatoni held up to meaty Bolognese and gooey puddles of Ricotta Cheese.  Unwilling to let any of the thinly pounded Pork go home in a doggy-bag, the bold flavor and crisp texture befitting an impressive presentation, it was only when seven Desserts arrived that the mistake was realized...though finding a bit of extra stomach space became easily justified by textbook Choux sandwiching Toasted Almond Ice Cream doused in thick Chocolate as well as housemade Macarons from which Coconut and Mocha were standouts.  Far from impressed by the Strawberry Crepe, an unannounced addition of Bananas doing no favors to the overly thick Pancake, it was fortunate that an Apple Crostada cooked crisp with Sugar stepped-up as did the yin-and-yang of Chocolate offered by airy Mousse and a dense Tart, the fact that Smoked Ricotta Ice Cream was sold out another bummer but made up for nicely by Cinnamon Frozen Yogurt that tastes a lot like Horchata.   FOUR STARS:  Easily overlooked on a property boasting three Steakhouses and a French Bistro boasting Thomas Keller's name Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro still has a lot of things going for it besides the Strip view, and with Chef Carrera now focusing on some lighter options the \"something for everybody\" space offers a lot of reasons to visit any time of day and with any sort of group.",

Hubby and I ate here immediately after checking into our hotel.  Convenience was key as we were starving; luckily, the food was pretty good!  It was a Sunday and during brunch hours; however, we wanted lunch food.  I chose the turkey club sandwich, which had avocado and basil aioli.  A really nice flavor addition!   It was a very all sandwich and kind of hard to eat though.  Served with fries, which were also yummy.  Hubby chose the Steak Frites, and he said it was cooked perfectly.  Overall, good service, nice atmosphere.  It wasn't fancy, very casual.  We liked our meal very much.  Not our absolute favorite place in the Venetian/Palazzo area (that's reserved for Sushi Samba) but we enjoyed nonetheless.",

We waited a long time for a server to come and eventually went inside to find one. After this was sorted, we ordered cocktails which were fine, but the food had issues. They were slow in coming. Burger was way undercooked. Oysters came with soggy lemons which had obviously been sitting in a bucket. But the fried calamari was excellent, about as good as I have had.  Service was polite but slow. Patio is pretty but there is lots of traffic noise.",

We loved our waitstaff, they were prompt and knowledgeable and kept the pace of our meal going at a comfortable rate.  The food is excellent here, I had the caprese salad and some others had the caesar. I would say that the portions are large, so you don't need appetizers and salads.  The entrees are plenty to eat on their own, so don't go crazy.  Our steaks were very good, especially the filet.  We had trouble with the temperature of a few of the entrees - 2 out of the 7 were not cooked correctly.  Our waiter fixed things promptly, and the rest of the meal continued without incident.  I enjoyed the filet, and it was just the right size.  Our desserts were quite good - we had 1 of each one and shared them among the table.  I liked the apple tart and ice cream the best.    Overall, this is a good place to take special guests or clients for dinner.  It's easy to get to, has plenty of seating and the food is good.  I thought it was a little loud and not a very intimate setting - so if you want romantic I would not go here.  I would eat here again if I had the chance.",

The tablecloth didn't fool us that we were sitting at a folding table. Though the inter-lockable banquet hall chairs we sat in did match the shoddy table perfectly, so perhaps this was the work of a quirky interior designer?   After buying a bottle of wine, we only had to ask three separate times to get a refill. But they were so excited to refill at that point, they topped off one of our glasses with the wrong wine creating a new blend.  And after our first drink order there was never even a prompt for another round.  Refills of the \"house water\" were also tough to come by.   We ordered two sides of mushrooms and received one. After asking twice for another one...we never got it. Never fear...we still got charged for two of them.   The bathroom in the restaurant would also have been disappointing at an interstate Arby's.  I have never seen such an enthusiastic and coordinated lack of effort from an entire restaurant before (save for the broiler guy, of course). And on a $1k+ bill to boot. Absurd.",

Every reason I wanted to run away screaming from the table is due to things customary to french dining.   For instance, I really hate feeling rushed while I eat. I'm not a fan of the servers hovering over my shoulder, waiting for to me to take the last bite from my plate before whisking away everything in front of me, and everything in my hand. I think it's pretty unnecessary and kind of rude.    Additionally, I didn't think the food was anything special. Actually, nobody at the table particularly enjoyed the food or service and we all agreed it was our least favorite dining experience in Vegas.  I will say, if you're looking for a quiet spot to enjoy an amazing cheese platter, have some wine, and have a nice view of the strip, I recommend you come here. Otherwise, there are way better restaurants like 50 meters away to enjoy a meal.",

My only suggestion is don't grill the sourdough, maybe a little darker toast.  The egg doesn't reach it enough to make it just the right amount of tenderness to cut.  While this doesn't sound like much of an issue, beware the person sitting across from you when you try to cut into it.  I hope they have great reflexes in the AM :)    I loved this so much that minus the bread actually coming from Bouchon I've learned to replicate this myself down to the oil & salt amounts that I like.  Banana strawberry crepe was tasty as well.  It's a standard crepe w/real cream whipped & some chocolate sauce.  If it's comp'ed or receiving a credit, be sure to tip the wait staff well.  We did & had the same server for 3 days & could not have been more thrilled.  Manuel was a delight & gave us wonderful suggestions of local Vegas things to do :)",

The space to sit in the booths are a bit cramped, so ask for a table instead, or maybe I'm just a bit too large for the space.  I gave this place a 4 star because the service was fantastic and the food was good.  The service was great, in that my water cup was constantly being refilled and almost rarely empty.  I did not know what to expect from a basic steak and eggs.  However I was a bit disappointed with how my food came out.  The steak was a bit dry.  And although the waitress confirmed with me that I wanted eggs over medium, they came out as eggs over easy.  I would have asked to exchange it, but we were on a time crunch.  The fries although have a large quantity, were all over done make it somewhat crunchy.  I don't mind the crunch but if you don't like it, this plate isn't for you.  If you do come here for brunch, I definitely would recommend some of their other breakfast items instead.  Apologies for the half-eaten ugly photo of the steak and eggs.

Their Hollandaise sauce is quite good, the eggs were cooked perfectly, but... They replace the traditional English muffin with a slice of brioche toast. Which is not a good thing. I remembered the bread had been an issue in the past, after I cut into it. Their brioche is always very crumbly, but ours today seemed more stale than usual. It was like eating a Benedict on a bed of dry bread crumbs. If they'll let you sub a real English muffin, I highly recommend the Benedict. If not, pass for something else.

    "text": "Had a good but not great brunch at Morels on a Saturday.  We had a group of 9 and were seated at a large circular table near the window facing the Strip.  Service was very strong throughout the meal.    You start with gratis toast, strawberry jam, and butter.  The jam is legit.  It's housemade and it was fantastic.  Were I to return I would definitely get a couple of slices of toast again.  I went with the chicken and waffles and also tried some scrambled eggs and potatoes off of another plate.  I also had a glass of orange juice which was very good.  Way better than I was expecting.  Clearly fresh squeezed and chilled.  Best OJ I've had in a long time.  The chicken and waffles comes with a lot of chicken.  I gave a couple of pieces away and still had plenty.  The waffle is nice and crispy but it's dry.  It sucked up the syrup like a sponge, I had to ask for another serving.  It's a good waffle, I had better on our trip, but it was good.  The chicken is crispy but needed seasoning.  I enjoyed this dish enough to order it again, but I imagine were I to return to Morels I would try something else, because the chicken and waffles weren't so good that I MUST get them again.  The eggs and potatoes were decent but had issues.  The eggs were scrambled too hard, they were fairly overcooked.  Also, my brother ordered the eggs with cheddar cheese, and all they did was lay a piece of cheddar on top rather than scrambling it with the cheese.  I am guessing this is why they were overcooked, they cooked the entire thing under the salamander to get the cheese melted after they had already scrambled the eggs.  The potatoes weren't seasoned in any way I could discern.  Once you added salt and pepper they were okay, but this was another disappointment.  We had a great lunch, I was catching up with old friends from my time living in Vegas.  They kept refilling our bottomless mimosas ($25) and did not rush us at all even though the meal had been over for around an hour.  Very hospitable.",

I recommend this dish to anyone who's looking for a satisfying but not too heavy breakfast or brunch. Another thing I loved from this place was their jam. The jam they have here is hands down the best! Its a must when you're in Vegas! The staff are all very friendly, they really make sure you feel welcomed and comfortable when you're in the restaurant. Last would be the macarons, also something people gotta try! Thanks for the awesome experience!",

    "text": "Went to Vegas for a spontaneous trip.  Actually, we decided to have one of those 10-10-10 weddings.  Stayed at the Palazzo and just wanted to try any nearby restaurant.  The hubby and I came here two days in a row, once for lunch and once for breakfast.  We enjoyed everything about this restaurant, well, except for the hostess that greeted us. She wasn't rude, but she wasn't friendly either (both days that we visited!).  She seemed very annoyed with us when we were trying to decide where to sit (the place was quite empty and so we had a large choice of tables both indoors and outdoors to choose from).  For lunch, we had the classic cheese fondue ($20 & mmm mmm), pork and veal meatloaf ($17), and quiche lorraine ($15).  All were very tasty and had a great presentation (too bad I didn't have my camera).  And for dessert, we had the trio creme brulee (3 mini cups of  vanilla, almond, and pistachio and 2 mini cookies to dip in them...all 3 flavors were mmm mmm mmm) along with a latte and Rwandan coffee.  For next day's breakfast, we had the seasonal fruit ($11), french toast ($14), and the free range egg crab omelette ($17) along with a latte and Rwandan coffee.  All were tasty, but nothing to go crazy for.  Both times, the wait staff and service were superb. We received quick service from friendly and conversational waiters.  Our water glasses were never half full.  All the waiters seemed to look after each other's tables when the others were busy.  The place is nice and classy-looking.  The restrooms were clean too.  They have a large assortment of wine on the wall and a variety of cheese to choose from also.  If we ever go back to Vegas, we'll probably visit here again.",

The server was very polite and courteous but I found the food disappointing and extremely overpriced. I had the chicken with spinach. The chicken was supposed to have been marinated for 24 hours - couldn't taste that. And the spinach was primarily salty. My colleague had pasta bolognese. The dish was grey and looked dull. No colors at all. And the taste was just like would they serve you at Denny's or another fast food joint. I know that location is everything but then that is what you're paying for.",

Orange juice does not taste fresh squeezed, which I'd expect from a place like this. Hmmm.  Overall, though, good enough, just not great - bolstered by views and surroundings.",

I had a decaf French Press Coffee and hubby had regular ($5.00 - all you can drink for that great price) so delicious.  They start you off with a roll and butter and French music overhead (French Country, the French rock-n-roll, then French Traditional...you get the picture).  We had toast with butter and raspberry jam ($2.50) didn't need it - too much food by end of meal but it was tasty.  I had the Veggie omelet, it comes with mixed greens or potatoes, stick with the greens. Lighter, tasty and hubby had the potatoes - nothing to write hone about. Save the calories for something else. The omelet was around ($15).  My husband had the Chiliquiles with potatoes, around the same price as my omelet - I did not keep my receipt but it was around $50 for lunch.  I enjoyed it, everyone around seemed to be as well. You can dine outdoors, we dined in, too warm that day.",

The fondue is superb and very reasonably priced. We splurged for seared fois gras and it was on par with the best we've had in Paris. The outdoor patio is breezy and has a fantastic view of the Strip. On top of great food and views, the service was the best we've ever experienced and we have had our fair share of top-priced dinners. The sommelier Alex B. was particularly fantastic both providing some fantastic pairings and going above and beyond actually repairing my better half's recently cracked souvenir glass with super glue (yes, I'm serious). Really above and beyond experience and I'm hoping they expand Morels to Miami soon.",

They asked us if we wanted each ingredient so if we said yes to all the ingredients the dressing should be good.  Others ate their salad but did say it was tangy.  For $17 a person, I would expect a better dressing.  The seafood fettuccine was pretty good.  Shrimp could have been a little softer but the other seafood was cooked perfect.  The location where we sat and the time of day had sunlight shining on us so we were resat.  Then they opened the curtains which made it too bright again.  They eventually closed the curtains.  They should not have even tried to sit anyone at those sunny tables.  They don't have any window coverings to help the situation for those few tables.  Bad restaurant design.",

The waitress seemed pretty uninformed on the menu, and she flat out didn't know about the 4 course summer special advertised at the entrance of the restaurant.   I ended up ordering a fish and chips, and the food was not bad. The fish was over-fried and a bit tasteless, but good with some S&P and the home-made tartar sauce.

We made a reservation for 8:30pm. Requested a private booth. When we arrived the booths were full and we were advised to grab a drink at the bar. We were OK with that.   Here is where we ran into major issue #1 -   Went to the bar and ordered two Hendrinks gin and tonics w/ lime.  We were informed they were out of Hendrinks (and all top shelf gins). We thought the barkeep was joking. He informed us that they had a private event a few nights earlier, said they were gin drinkers & cleared them out. Shocked by this response as I know that most quality Vegas establishments will restock quickly after such an event. In addition, they can always borrow from another bar/restaurant they have a relationship with inside the hotel. Finally, they can borrow from the massive inventory the hotel keeps on hand at all times.   The bartender was named Brandon and he was very nice and friendly. He made some great suggestions for alternative drinks. We were bummed that we could not enjoy some quality gin drinks with our food, but he made us feel better about the situation. In addition, he poured us some complimentary birthday glasses of Champagne in honor of my wife's birthday. Classy touch. He's a great asset to this restaurant.   After a 20 minute wait past our reservation time we were brought to our booth. The restaurant was 60% filled. It was a clean and nice room. Great sight-lines, minimalistic decor (typical French restaurant). Only advice would be to turn the lights down a few notches, it was too bright in the room to create an intimate atmosphere.   Our server identified himself and was super attentive. He knew the menu inside and out and made some killer recommendations.   We ordered the \"PETIT PLATEAU DE MER,\" which translate into petite platter of seafood. It consisted of 4 Shrimp, 6 Oysters, Octopus Ceviche &  1/2 Dungeness Crab. The cost was $60. Well worth it for the freshness we received. It was delicious. I will go out on a limb and say this was one of the freshest raw seafood platters in Vegas. I highly suggest you order this if you go to Morels.  For our appetizer we ordered \"CHEF'S PRIME BEEF TENDERLOIN TARTARE.\" It consisted of Quail Egg, Truffled & Potato Chips. It was unique. I could taste some fancy homemade ketchup in the mix. My wife though it had a Chipotle flavor. The server confirmed that they do indeed use a homemade ketchup and mustard when preparing it. It was wet and sticky in texture, not your typical beef tartare. With that said, we enjoyed it.   For our entrees we ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($52) and the 18 Hour Braised Short Rib ($37). As a side we ordered the steamed asparagus ($10). The short rib entree was decent. The meat was a bit dry and over cooked. I have tasted better, for far less money. I did enjoy the fresh bacon pieces on the plate. The Colorado rack of Lamb was good. My wife mentioned it was in the same category as the rack of lamb at every other god restaurant in the city. But at $52 it was higher priced than than those other restaurants. You would expect to have a superior cut and plate at that price point. The asparagus was as expected, tasted good. Think both entrees were also good, just not amazing.   Here is another area of opportunity for the management to improve upon. Clean up and fix your confusing wine list. It was on white printed computer paper, hole punched and put in a cheap binder. The first three pages were dirty and had been torn from the rings of the binder. The wine list was almost impossible to read. Not sure who designed this, or who approved it's use? It's not a quality look at all. I will attach some pics so you can address it. We were ordering $20+ glasses of wine from a menu that looked like something you would find at the local diner.   We ordered the ice cream as a desert. It was a delicious ending. They put a candle in the desert for her birthday. Nice touch.   In summary: We spent almost $400 for a birthday dinner experience at a fine dining restaurant. The service was fantastic. The raw shell fish platter was superb. Unfortunately the entrees were mediocre. The wine list confusing. The bar not fully stocked. Not the 5 star experience we had hoped / paid for. Few tweaks and Morel's can be a top contender.",

    "text": "Amazing quiche!  I want to take a moment to focus on the quiche Lorraine here......................AMAZING  It's buttery, salty from the bacon, sweet from the caramelized onions, flaky and so damn great. No joke the best I've had in this city. I've also lived in Paris many years ago and I fondly remember gaining 20 pounds in just six months over quiche Lorraine there!   The restaurant is beautiful with a bistro feel that has very sexy art all over the place and our waitress was kind enough to give me a few postcards with the artists info who is Tom Cannon. The art is perfect and they also have a beautiful outdoor space that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd.   The food is really great here and did I mention they have quiche Lorraine? Ok let's get through this and the highlights without losing my focus. The tuna tartare was fresh and light. The cheese fondue was decadent and fun to dip & eat. The crab omelet my friends ordered was fluffy and delicious and my quiche was out of this world. I remember every bite...:)  We also received complimentary dessert which was a pleasant surprise. Thank you for the delicious profiteroles with warm chocolate sauce!   The service was on point and we came over on a weekday for a business lunch and luckily had the place to ourselves. This however worried me because this place should be popular.   I have had dinner at this location before but we didn't have a fantastic experience due to waiting too long even with reservations but this lunch experience was perfect.",

Some of the reviews were less than flattering, but my party of eight was very happy.  - Easy to find - Excellent service - Nice space, not too loud - The charcuterie board was above average, but not excellent.  Good cheeses, especially the mimolette.  The cured meats were pretty standard - The beef tartare was average by itself, but combined with Morels' homemade ruffles, it was excellent - The steak (prime rib eye) was very nicely aged.  Nice and meaty, tender, full of flavor.  I tasted the beef rather than salt and butter, which was refreshing in a high end steakhouse",

    "text": "Let's put it this way: we like this place so much we ate here twice during our last trip. With all the restaurants to choose from in town, that should say something!  We've eaten breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here on various trips and have never had a bad meal. The waitstaff is also excellent. Attentive, accurate and if you get Tito or Sal, funny as well!  Some general notes: Breakfast - skip the Bloody Mary cart unless you have a special request. The bartender can crank one out that is just as good in half the time. This last trip I tried the Turkey Hash - diced turkey, potatoes, sliced jalapenos, grilled brussels sprouts topped with a sunny side up egg, served in a sizzling hot cast iron pan. To die for! The wife's fruit plate had excellent selections of perfectly ripe fruit and melon. The omelets are huge and stuffed with all sorts of goodness.  Lunch - Good burgers, good steaks, great service.  Dinner - If you get the chance, try the Tasting Menu when it's offered. The steak tartare is quite possibly the best I've ever had. The steaks are great, the short rib transcendent. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  We were bummed when Society Cafe closed next door at Encore, but Morel's more than makes up for that loss. Excellent bar and good wine selection as well.",

    "text": "I came here Sunday 6/12 with a girlfriend for brunch during Restaurant Week. I love Restaurant Week because you get to enjoy good food and it's for a good cause. A portion of all proceeds goes to help the Three Square food bank in Southern Nevada. She made a reservation online using Open Table for 11am. Morels is located in the Grand Lobby at the Palazzo, right next to the hotel check in and Lavo. We arrived promptly for our reso and it was found right away. We asked to sit outside on the patio and we were seated at a table in the shade.   The Restaurant Week menu included a 3 course meal of either breakfast or lunch. Dinner is also available later in the evening. My friend and I opted to do both breakfast and lunch and share everything. The first courses were seasonal fruit and yogurt and a Greek salad. We got to pick our mains and we chose steak frites and classic eggs benedict. And for dessert we got vanilla creme brulee and a strawberry crepe. I also ordered an orange juice, and she was supposed to receive French pressed coffee as it came with the breakfast, but it wasn't until we were well into our second course that we had to flag someone down to bring us the coffee. My friend also said she would have probably ordered a bloody mary from the cart they had, but was never offered. That is the only gripe I have to say about Morel's is the service was lacking.   Food wise, everything was delicious. The seasonal fruit was fresh and paired nicely with the vanilla yogurt. The Greek salad was like a wedge salad with tons of olives, feta, and tomatoes dressed in a light vinaigrette. The steak frites was an 8oz piece of skirt steak and fries. The steak was cooked perfectly medium as we requested. The fries although plain were quite tasty. I dipped them in some ketchup. I enjoyed the classic benedict, which was 2 poached eggs, country ham and a generous amount of hollandaise atop a thick piece of brioche bread. Last but not least, dessert. The vanilla creme brulee was fantastic. I loved breaking into the sugary shell and indulging in the smooth vanilla egg custard underneath. I could have eaten the whole thing, but I had a delicious strawberry crepe waiting for me. The crepe was light and airy, filled with a lovely whipped cream and then topped with strawberries, bananas, and chocolate sauce. For both of us we spent around $32 with tax and tip which is not bad when brunching on the strip. We both agreed that we would definitely come back to Morel's.",

I wish I remembered the name of the gentleman who was working with him, because he was also fantastic.   I had the Pesto Chicken with fingerling potatoes. The chicken was flavored perfectly, succulent, and looked as good as it tasted.  The macaroni and cheese with lobster was underwhelming to the point of not being good. I would recommend staying away from that.  My husband had the salmon with lentils and that was very good.   My dad had the rigatoni bolognese which was also underwhelming. There was nothing wrong with it per se, but it did not stand out as something we would have again.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner, but not enough to justify the price.",

Keeps you occupied for a good handful of minutes while tilting your head and wondering whose which what body parts are depicted. We came for a birthday brunch and I was pretty happy with my king crab eggs benedict. The oysters were fine as well. The biggest complaint was the bloody mary; apparently the \"non spicy\" ones were still too spicy to chug down for most of the group. Overall, it's a decent brunch spot, especially if your group is staying at the Venetian or Palazzo and are far too hungover to crawl very far. They also made the birthday girl give a giddy shriek with a really cute sparkler candle on top of a delicious creme brulee, so they get some bonus points there!",

    "text": "We made our 2nd visit ever to Morels this weekend, and Morels solidified it's place in my top 5 LV Strip restaurants.  The weather was wonderful, so we perched on the patio, which is great for taking in the views and people, but elevated and set behind a fountain to protect your experience from the strip commotion.  The service was exceptional.  Quality is where Morels excels over many strip competitors.  Every item offered is consistently of the highest quality, and crafted with precision.   I love their massive cheese list, offering many cheeses from all over the world.  The cheese menu is well organized by cow, goat, and sheep milk; then it is sorted by texture.  The meat and rillette (pate) selection is considerably smaller, but all high quality items with detailed descriptions.  Next time I want to order the Scottish Salmon rillette.  The charcuterie presentation includes tags on each cheese with the name, description, and region.  We ordered the 3 cheese, 3 meat board, which also showed up with the most delicious honeycomb and fig preserves.  Our 3 cheeses:  1.  Mimolette Extra Vielle - Nord-Pas-de Calais, France (Firm Cow's milk) - salty and a little nutty, once banned by the FDA  2.  Valencay Pyramide - Loire Valley, France (Semi soft Goat's milk) - mellow and savory, one of Napoleon's favorite cheeses  3.  Idiazabel - Navarra/Basque, Spain (Firm Sheep's milk) - buttery, nutty, smokey; pairs well with salami and cured meats",

The manager (mark) was super helpful and professional in helping recommend some good dessert to end the night with.   We ended up going with the classic profiteroles, and the traditional creme brulee.  Not too sweet, perfectly homemade dessert dishes (and a sparkler to boot for my birthday).  Our bartender (Julie) was also very pleasant and knowledgeable.  I tried their infused bourbon, Red Rider b.b. Which is one of the signature drinks here and it was very good, just a little heavy with dessert.  So she recommended an Aperitief style cocktail with bullied bourbon that was amazing.

About a third through my steak, which was medium rare-rare, I found what looked to be a numbered tag or label - similar to what you would get if you ordered food and had to wait - at the bottom of my dish, drenched in steak jus and all. They were decent enough to waive the bill, offered to replace my meal, and asked if there was anything they could offer me to drink, but by that point I'd lost all appetite and just wanted to get out of there.   Seater, server and manager all seemed nice, but perhaps the kitchen needs to match up to the exterior.",

For appetizers, we shared the Tuna Tartare and the Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Salad, both were fantastic. For an entree my boss and I shared the Brick Chicken (we have a favorite restaurant back home in Colorado that makes something similar so naturally, we wanted to try it). It was different but very good and in addition to the appetizers we had already gotten, sharing one was perfectly sized. Our guest got the Surf & Turf (filet mignon and lobster tail) which was JUST as good at it sounds! We also shared a side of green beans; they were tasty but I will say that $11 for a less-than-generously portioned side of green beans is outrageous. Their sommalier suggested a phenomenal bottle of pinot noir that paired well with everything.  We ended the evening with the Trio of Creme Brulees - they were great! Overall, the atmosphere was very nice, the service was good (the junior server in our case was more attentive than our primary server - maybe that's why they had both!), and the food was excellent. I would recommend Morel's to anyone and would love to return next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

I have been jet lagged and a bit \"blah\" during my business trip. Everyone I have encountered has been outstanding. When I travel, I try to go to different places. I tried several restaurants during my stay. Mostly I have been disappointed by the degradation of service and/or food at these 3-5 star establishments. Morels has been my go-to for a pick me up meal. Tonight is my last night and I felt tired and sad from leaving my family. I was treated to an empathetic staff and a wonderful steak. Little things go a long way. Will keep this as my regular place when I am in town. Much appreciated!",

The calamari was good but portion was small. We Ordered table-side ceases salad. The server had us taste the dressing he prepared and appeared to be irritated when we asked to add additional Parmesan as it tasted a lot like vinegar. When we ordered our dinner, one of the guests asked to have calamari be brought out with the salad and he said \"um, I'll try\".  My husband and I got the Tomahak steak to share (about $150 a couple). I was not impressed with the taste of the steak). The service was not good. I was not impressed. I came to this restaurant because I read other reviews and thought it would be good. I would NOT recommend!",

Irwin (our brunch host) and Jared (our host at lunch) were simply amazing making this a fun experience - so many laughs. Best  brunch ever!!!!",

Friendly, attentive, and with an amazing command of the menu, both food and liquor wise.  Next, the sommelier, Alex, was not only knowledgeable, but friendly and funny. I enjoyed him immensely, as well as the wine suggestion he gave us.  We started with a cheese plate. We picked our five, and I'm not sure you could go wrong with any of the cheeses they offer. I'm a big bleu fan, and they did not disappoint.  Our main course was the \"surf and turf for two\" which is just the lobster and a steak of your choosing split for you. It was amazing (you're not saving any money though, it's still charged as two entrees.)  For dessert we had the cremates brulee' trio. I'm a huge creme brulee fan and this hit the mark like you wouldn't believe.  I highly recommend this place, just be prepared that it's not a cheap meal.",

    "text": "This place was frankly horrible in food quality and ironically great in service. My friends and I dropped by for a lunch while we were in Vegas for the weekend, but we did not expect this place to be so horrible.  They first gave us complimentary Beignets that were disgusting! They were dry and tasteless. And why were they not dusted with powdered sugar? They were covered in table sugar and cinnamon, which waa a horrible idea.  I got some sort of Turkey Avocado sandwich. It tasted okay, nothing to write home about, however, the bread was very hard to bite through. It was rock hard. I do not enjoy struggling this hard to eat my food. The salad also looked as if it had lost life on the plate, overdressed and limp.  My boyfriend ordered a Croque Madame I believe. It tasted better than most things we ordered, but the fries that came with his ordered were empty and lifeless. They was no crunch, no seasoning, no flavor! How do you mess up fries?  One strange item was the toast that was given to us. It had a slightly chewy texture, but it ended up being crumbly and breaking down into dust. I was in awe of this strange toast...  The saving grace of all this disastrous food was the service. We were constantly offered water, checked up on it, and treated with kindness.  Long story short, I will never come back here. Lesson learned.",

    "text": "SKIP AT ALL COSTS!   I came here with 3 of my friends and not one of us had a positive thing to say. Overpriced, overcooked, bad service... the list goes on but allow me to elaborate. We came here after seeing the very impressive Summer Tasting Menu on social media. 4 plates for $47.50 and opted to do the wine pairing flight for the additional $20.  1st impression: BEAUTIFUL spot! Gorgeous decor but empty on a Tuesday night. Sure Tuesdays are typically not indicative of a busy restaurant but you would at least expect half the restaurant full. I would say there were 4 tables occupied including ours. Our waiter came quickly and went through all of the specials not giving us a second to say anything. After about 3 minutes of him telling us the specials, we informed him that we wanted to do the tasting menu and he seemed disappointed in the choice, he said \"Really? Are you sure? Do you know about our tasting menu?\" he proceeded to say that the portions are extremely small but we said that was fine and wanted it anyway. We got two rolls of bread each and what looked like a tube squirted piece of butter that was really good enough for about one roll. Why are we being so cheap with the bread and butter?  I ordered the Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartare, the Sunsweet Watermelon and Arugula Salad, the Grass Fed New York Sirloin and the Chocolate Mousse.   Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartare: I would rate the dish a 5/10. It was well seasoned but in traditional tartare, there is a quail egg on the dish. It was also advertised to have a quail egg on the dish but somehow it never made it to the plate. It was also served with TWO potato chips. TWO! It was a small dish but it needed more than two chips.  Watermelon and Arugula Salad: I would rate the dish an 8/10. Really delicious and refreshing but how can you screw up a salad? This was the best thing we were served with the biggest portion. I enjoyed it very much.  Grass Fed New York Sirloin: I would rate the dish a 4/10. Extremely tough meat and it was thick like a filet mignon, not what you want when you order a New York steak. Came with mashed potatoes and they were literally that. Imagine mashing potatoes and serving them without seasoning or garlic, cheese, cream ANYTHING. Gritty and nasty. The only rescuing factor was the vegetables that came with it.  Chocolate Mousse: So good! 10/10 The only thing worth eating here.  Other things to mention, between each course, we waited about 10-15 minutes. We would get a wine for our next course and it would be sitting there for 10-15 minutes waiting for our next dish to be served. My friend ordered the calamari as her first course and she didn't even eat it. She said she couldn't chew through it. Another friend had to give back a glass of wine because the glass was dirty... come on... rookie mistakes here.  This was the worst $70 meal I have ever had and it would just be best to advise you all, if you're thinking of coming here, to just not.",

We were the second party in the entire beautiful dining room and by the time we left 90 minutes later there were still only a handful of diners at 6:30 PM.   Our server and her assistant were both friendly and the meal was served pretty fast as she asked if our group was on any time limitations for a show (we were and appreciated her asking).   Our first course Caesar Salad was tasty and ample. Our main course choices (salmon and chicken) were presented nicely ... the chicken was moist and served in a larger than expected portion. The salmon was fine but I would likely try something else next time (I don't care to have my fish served with its oily and fatty skin still on it) and not try to be so \"healthy\". Our third course for dessert were profiteroles but these were served simply as two cream puffs ... I only ate the whipped ice cream filling because the puffs were stale.  I would not suggest the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegas.com</a> pre-pay dinner package ... you don't get any choice on your first course appetizer or your third course dessert, the second course main choices are limited to three: chicken, fish or beef, and drinks and gratuity are extra charge.    The dining room manager was great when we returned after our show after realizing the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegas.com</a> package excluded gratuity. No mention was made by the staff about this fact (as they try to be \"discreet\" about it) leaving the customer unclear as to what dollar amount to base the gratuity on and leaving no bill holder in the table to imply a gratuity should be left in it.   So we initially walked out not understanding this and short changing our friendly waitress and her assistant. We corrected this afterwards, but it required us having to walk all the way back to Morels to rectify the situation. Many other customers would likely not bother to do this.",

    "text": "When it comes to location, it doesn't get much better than the Palazzo, which is right between the Wynn and the Venetian. This extravagant setting is the perfect lure for the masses of locals and tourists walking the strip, and as we approach the hotel, anticipation begins to mount for the experience ahead.  Morels theme is French-American cuisine with a heavy emphasis on quality steaks, a large selection of raw seafood, hot seafood, cheeses, charcuterie, and award winning list of wine. From first impressions, to flavorful food and great hospitality. Unlike many fine dining establishments, this steakhouse is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner with brunch offered on Saturdays and Sundays.  Lunch offers various soups, salads and other small appetizers, the mid-day menu features a variety of burgers and sandwiches served with a salad or a side of pommes frites. Lunch also introduces a diverse collection of main courses as well as an esteemed iced seafood selection with six premium offerings including fresh oysters and two well-designed seafood samplers.  If you're walking the strip, the entrance to Morels is quite convenient, just steps from the large glass doors leading in to the Palazzo. The bar itself, like much of the interior architecture, is built of dark wood stretching upward, nearly reaching the ceiling. There is an impressive collection of vodkas, gin, scotch, whiskey, tequila, rum and cognac.  The dining room is really spacious. The booths look out across the open room and offer a view of all the happenings within the restaurant as well as a direct line-of-sight through the numerous window-paneled doors that lead to the outside patio. The Marie room is large enough to accommodate up to 50 guests comfortably, and the Louis room, perhaps the more desirable of the two because of the large window and natural lighting, has enough space for up to 40.  The charcuterie boards include freshly sliced bread and each individual piece of cheese is garnished with a small paper label with the name of the cheese, the type of milk used to create it and the country the cheese is from.  The Caesar Salad is prepared table-side. First, fresh squeezed lemon juice, then we add home-made sour cream, a little bit of Dijon mustard, next garlic, a tiny bit of anchovies, some mayonnaise instead of the more traditional raw egg, and then finished off with a bit of Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, plenty of olive oil, and fresh grated parmesan. The salad is crisp and full of different flavors.   The tuna tartare is great quality with avocado, peppers, cilantro, pine nuts and sesame oil, all on top of a delicate fried truffle gafete, reminiscent of a very fancy potato chip. The buttery avocado is perfect with the rich, salty tuna and offers a creamy consistency to each bite that complements the crunch of the pine nuts and the lingering truffle aftertaste of the gafete.  Next comes the 32-ounce Porterhouse (carved tableside), Sauteed Green Beans in Foie Gras Butter, Potato Dauphinois, Artichoke Au Morels, and the Chef's Country Mac & Cheese, along with individual helpings of seafood fettucine, showcasing Manila clams, mussels, shrimp and lobster with tomato concassee, garlic and white wine.  The all natural, 28-day aged beef, grilled under a 1200 degree broiler and served with a house-made bordelaise sauce and Morel mushroom sauce. In addition to new cutlery, a server also lays out a long rectangular dish which holds another Morels specialty. He explains that what we see before us are three rare salts recommended specifically for the enhancement of steak flavor. There was Alder wood-smoked Black Sea salt, Pink Sea Salt from the Philippines, and Pink Himalayan salt (the rarest of the three). Each adds a unique twist to the meat, and I particularly favor the charred, roasted smoke flavor of the Black Sea salt. I slice through a large piece of the filet really like how well the outer layer has been seared, hiding the perfect medium rare interior. The rib eye is thick, and is effortless to cut through. This piece is all about extra flavor, with a beautiful marbling of fatty tissues. The bordelaise and Morel mushroom sauce offer a rich addition to an already well-rounded set of flavors and the Black Sea salt is a nice addition.  The Country Mac & Cheese is thick and creamy. Beneath the crispy bread crumb topping, a balanced combination of cured ham and noodles are engulfed in a gourmet sauce of parmesan, blue, Ementhal and Gruyere cheeses. The Artichokes Au Morel are tender and provide a noticeable kick of fresh garlic, and the green beans receive an extra flavor boost from fresh shallots, garlic and a sprits of lemon juice. In a close second to the Country Mac & Cheese, the Potato Dauphinois is a cross between potatoes au gratin and a classic baked potato, served fresh from the oven with roasted garlic and cream.",

    "text": "The fact that places like this exist kind of blow my mind... in a bad way.  We came for lunch and had the mushroom souffle, a Greek salad, fries with truffle mayonnaise, and an omelet. Both souffle and omelet came with side green salads. Our meal, with coffee and tip cost just under one hundred dollars.   The souffle was dry, chewy, and we really could not taste the supposed star of the show -- the mushroom. The Gruyere cheese sauce it was served with not properly emulsified and so it was full of oil pockets.    The Fries with truffle mayonnaise should never have been served to any customer.  The fries were cold and slightly stale. The mayonnaise had heavily oxidized to the point of forming translucent crusty curdy edges. It clearly was left out in its serving boat for several hours before it made its way to my plate to get this way. If this was a house made mayo with raw egg it it would not have been safe to eat. This is a serious lack in quality control.   The Greek salad was quartered Romain lettuce cores that were over bitter and not fully coated with the dressing. Covered with cubes of feta, much smaller cubes of cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes and olives.  While the \"toppings\" were not bad the presentation was disjointed and this can't-mess-it-up dish was only partially edible.   The side green salads were made with wilted, bitter, old greens. The way the spring mix greens get after sitting in a refrigerator for a week after purchase. Again this should never have made it to a customer's plate.   The quality of the food at the price paid was so low that there really is no point to considering service in this review.",

    "text": "Went there for a dinner with a team of 9 people. It was a mid week early evening but the service was very slow. It took us 3 hours to complete the dinner and leave. I was starving when we arrived there, so the slow service didn't help. Also, I'm used to get a bread basket at the beginning of the meal, so even if you have to wait a long time for your meal, you can at least eat some of the bread and be good. Oh, I was wrong here. We did not get any bread until the first course arrived. So weird.  For the starter, we went with Grand Seafood Platter. The presentation was very nice, didn't had a chance to try all items, but the scallops and shrimp ceviche were very good.  For the main, I got the lobster pasta and it was delicious. They serve it in an empty lobster shell, and the portion was very generous. Also, a lot of lobster and scallops. I think that was the best dinner plate from all we got, the rest of my companions got steaks and they were not happy either with the quality of meat, taste and the proper cooking. I tried some of the table sides, everything was just ok. I was so glad I went with pasta.   Overall, very pricey place for not necessarily the best food options. Especially considering that this should be a steakhouse, and it ends up that nobody was satisfied with steaks, and the best part of the meal was seafood.",

We make a beeline for it every time and this time enjoyed it twice - both times loving the fact that we could sit on their large outdoor patio and watch the would go by with a killer view of the strip.  A few notes on Morels - the service is always impeccable, perhaps the best on the Strip. As an example when we asked if kids could sit in the lounge they declined but the manager came out to apologize when there was no need as we were fine but it is an example of them always going above and beyond.   They have the best cheese selection and it's always super fresh. They also have delicious seafood, steaks and a great brunch with bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's made table-side to your preference. They are also known for an excellent and comprehensive wine selection.  This visit we tried them for brunch and lunch - we had amazing oysters which were fresh and well prepared, a cheese and meat board, the fries ( delicious by the way ) and on a later visit crab Benedict with a spicy Bloody Mary. On this visit they comped us free desserts from the holiday menu - pumpkin pie and pecan pie which were the best we had ever tasted.  The service was amazing and it was so much fun sitting out enjoying the great weather with great food. Cannot wait to go back!!",

We ordered a side of roasted mushrooms and they were way over-cooked, kind of difficult to chew, felt rubbery. They'll charge you $65 or more for a single piece of steak, without a salad or side. If you want a side you have to pay extra for it, like $12 or more. I will say, besides the mushrooms, the food was tasty. I really liked the filet mignon I ordered. Cooked just the way I asked and full of flavor.",

The fish is Sole and it was completely grease free, light, and tasty. It was served with an excellent herbed tartar sauce. The portion was huge and who makes better fries than a French bistro? The giant Wild Alaskan caught Prawns were delicious. It was too hot to use the magnificent patio, so staying in and admiring the soft core porn on the walls was a fine substitute. Morels is at Palazzo or Venalazzo.",

We had a set menu for a private event so I can't speak to the whole menu. I can speak to what we ate and the amazing service we were provided.  For appetizer we had the option of Vegetable soup or steak tartare. I am not breathe enough for raw meat so I had the soup with low expectations. The broth was so fresh and tasted homemade. What an amazing soup.  I then chose the wedge salad which was totally refreshing.   My main entree was the salmon. I really love to order fish at steak restaurants as it is often an unsung hero and underrated. It was between that or the filet. I find filet overrated as it has such a low fat content. I made a great choice as the wheat berries paired nicely.  Lastly, I chose chocolate mousse as the desert and I thought this would be a mousse cake. It was not and did not have a lot of flavor. Not enough to ruin the night.  Our servers were incredibly attentive. If you are in Vegas, make a stop here. I highly recommend.",

My beef was with the ceviche. It's not the ceviche I know and love (the Mexican kind.) Everything else on that starter was top notch. They also give you a beet salad, but I didn't think much about it.  Service was good. It's hard to complain when they have those guys with the pepper grinders. That's how you know you're in the big leagues.  Depending on where you sit, you might get lucky like me and get an epic view of the strip. I got to see a guy dressed as a raggedy Pikachu dancing in the corner. An amazing experience.",

This was my first time eating at Morels French Steakhouse located in the Palazzo & Venetian Casino and this would be my last. The menu looks very promising being upscale and all but when you actually ate some of the food it was a big disappointment. I ordered take out for my disappointing dinner and had the following   French fries 2/5 if you were to have steaks fries it might have been better or the Great Greeks fries is way better  Freshly made tater tots 1/5 ok they were made fresh and??? Lacks a lot of things   Rigatoni Bolognese 3/5 the pasta was kinda chewy and nothing really stood out  Bone in ribeye 20 0Z 2/5 hmmm I'm not sure if it's 20 0Z but it was over cooked when i asked for med well   Loaded baked potatoes 2/5 wow even this one was super meh I took one bite and threw it away   Cold press organic juice 2/5 nothing stood out even regular Jamba Juice is way better   It's a shame for a higher end restaurant with higher price tag the food was not on the same level as other competition. So far the best steak I've ever ate was at Ruth Chris, the Ranch in Anaheim. Please go back to the drawing board or choose new cooks and make something stand out.",

Service was great but somehow the waitress failed to give us the happy hour discounts as advertised and we never noticed until we got back to our room afterwards. So instead of a happy hour deal it was more of a happy hour bait n switch scam.   But luckily the food was very good and of exceptional quality. I loved the steak tartar and the bruchetta was some of the best i have ever had. The side of mac n cheese was glorious after a day at the beach club and it totally hit the spot and satisfied our hunger pangs. Get the mac and cheese. Its worth it and you wont regret it. Our drinks were mixed well and had a good ratio of liquor and juice. Overall the quality was worth the full price but we were not happy about not receiving the happy hour special despite asking about it when ordering.   Ps. You must check out the dining room. They have a great wine cellar perfect for photos and super cool to see! Dont miss it on your way to the washroom",

    "text": "By far the worst experience I had the entire tome in Las Vegas and close to ever. To begin with it's a French bistro......... and the French onion soup was the worst soup I have ever had in my entire life. It consisted of mostly cheese and hardly any onion, the broth was not flavorful at all. Honestly just HORRIBLE, don't recommend at all!!! We also ordered a half dozen of the market oysters, they were OK, most definitely not the best we have had but not the worst. And making everything even worse, the service was just as bad. So I called ahead of time because I saw on the menu that they do brunch Friday-Sunday and I just wanted to verify/ see if they would be serving their lunch menu as well. The host told me the brunch menu, which was fine because the French onion soup (the reason we went was on that menu). We sat down at the bar and the bartender says he'll be right with us.... no one else at the bar, he was just attached the wine bottles to their pour spouts. Unsure why he couldn't greet us, get us menus, and drinks to begin with before, but whatever. He then hands us the breakfast menu, which is not correct considering is says on the dang menu Monday-Thursday until 4pm. So we asked him and he said no that's the menu so my boyfriend ok never mind. While walking out I had to ask the host because I called so who was wrong. Sure enough the bartender was wrong and it was brunch so we sat back up at the bar and ordered drinks. They came out quickly which was nice but we also asked for one of the TVs to be on one of the bowl games, considering the weekend we were there. He completely forgot, we couldn't get his attention so it wasn't until a manager was behind the bar that we were able to get the game on.   HORRIBLE SERVICE AND HORRIBLE FOOD (ESPECIALLY FRENCH ONION SOUP)- don't waist a dime on that god awful soup.",

He is exactly what you'd hope for in a classy place like this. Knows the menu inside and out; has a great, easy-going sense of humor, and mixes a fantastic cocktail!   My date and I shared a Meat & Cheese plate (we let Dave choose our selections for us) along with a citrus-marinated fish \"salad\" and a Creme brulee. All were delicious, and reasonable portions for the price.   My favorite cocktail of the evening was the Red Rider B.B. with Bourbon & Benedictine - and a bunch of other tasty stuff.  A little sweeter than what I usually like, but it was quite tasty, and felt like a good celebration drink.  It's a small bar with an unobtrusive tv. Great for getting away from the madness of The Strip and relaxing in style for a couple of hours.",

The downside to ordering all this food is that they give you CHUNKS of friends! We ended up taking a whole box full of fries home that were mediocre. I honestly enjoyed the salad most. IT was light and pleasantly dressed. The steak was very flavorful and provided a distinct flavor. My least favorite was the prawns.

When steaks arrived, the other 3 were definitely ribeyes. But mine absolutely looked like a New York steak. I asked the busboy who brought my dish if mine was indeed a ribeye. He said yes. I ate a few bites in and knew it was not a ribeye. Our waiter walked by several times without asking how our steaks were but noticed him looking at my steak but no mentioning anything. I finally flagged him down and said this is definitely not a ribeye. He said ok an brought it back to kitchen. Then few minutes later manager came to me and said they are making me new piece of meat. I asked if indeed mine was not ribeye but manager said he didn't know but that my new steak would be out soon.  All I wanted was acknowledgement that they screwed up and apology. Did not ever get it. Even when waiter came by with new steak I asked him if my old meat was New York steak and he said when it comes to mess ups , he just mentions it to his manager and let's him handle the kitchen and he also said he just washes his hands when it comes to the mess ups. Ridiculous that not one person took accountability and apologized for error. All they said was my new steak would be out soon. Wow. That was total turnoff. Especially when we are staying at the Venetian hotel , it was not representing the experience of the hotel. Bad bad bad. Spending almost $500 for the four of us but getting a poor problem resolution experience. Just apologize, people! With all the other steakhouses in Vegas, won't be recommending this one to anyone again based on this!",

    "text": "I'm going to drop this place 4 stars instead of the 3 I really feel that they deserve, because I'm biased... And for 2 reasons. But I'll start by saying, my steak was nicely marbled, and cooked properly, their fries were very nice as well, and the salad was lightly tossed in a vinaigrette and not overly drenched in the stuff.  Service, while pleasant, resistant to the idea that, I don't want fucking potato salad with this cut of meat, I would like fries... Don't ASK the chef, tell him that's what I would prefer - and he'll do it regardless of how much he hates the idea.  So, based on all of the above, I'd have given them 3 stars.  BUT  Firstly: They have, what might possibly the best cheese selection in Vegas.  My doctor hates and loves this place for me... I'm turning 30 soon, and he tells me I should take in more calcium in my diet to help my bones finish their structure properly.  Most people drink milk - I eat ooey, gooey, smelly, stinky cheese to fulfill this request of his.  Unfortunately, it's going to give me high cholesterol when I finally get the blood test he's been asking me to get for the past 3 years.  Secondly:  They have a fantastic beer selection.  I've been to quite a few places in Vegas, but this place seems to have the best selection in beer. AND they don't have Bud Light on the menu THANK GOD - A serious beer menu for a serious beer drinker. They do have a hole in the menu that, could be filled (the Sommelier agreed - And he wrote the menu) for a Porter.  But all in all, if you like beer (anything with \"light\" or \"lite\" in the name isn't beer... It's alcoholic soda water - Grow up and have something flavorful) go here for a round or two at the bar.",

    "text": "We chose to have dinner at Morels on Wed. night because my husband and I are both fans of French and being that he is on this steak kick \"French Steak House\" seemed to fit the bill. As you walk through the entrance of the restaurant you can smell all the delicious cheeses that are displayed in the cheese case. Our waiter was Chandler. He was \"awesome!\"  Upon his suggestion I ordered a glass of \"Sin Quan\" . He informed me that it is a hard to find wine that was opened by mistake and not normally served by the glass. The wine and beer list is impressive and that always makes for a good night! My husband had several different rare beers after starting with his favorite \"go to beer\" (Chimay) That was served in the correct glass. (Thank you!)   Shrimp Cocktail : Fabulous! Really fresh; Chilled to perfection; Beautifully presented. The only thing that could have made it slightly better for me is a lemon wedge.   French Onion Soup : Jeff loved it!   Baby Iceberg salad : I ordered with no bacon. Really crisp and tasty. I really liked the sun dried tomatoes.  Asked for salt and was presented with a variety of three. I have never seen this before and thought it was a great touch.  Filet: Cooked perfectly rare; Juicy  Mushrooms: Nice size portion for two; So tasty; One of my favorite things!   Mac and Cheese: None for me but my husband said it was good. Not to rich; not to cheesy; Again nice size portion  For our Cheese course we chose a variety of three after telling our server what we liked in our cheeses he did very well with suggestions. The cheese monger presented the cheeses and was very nice. We had a Mimolette/cows milk from france, Cashel Blue/cows milk from Ireland and the \"most stinky but interesting cheese I have yet to experience The Grayson/cows milk from Virgina US. My husband and I were impressed and pleased with the selection.   Overall I would say this was a wonderful experience. I haven't had such impeccable service in way to long. I could say that the service was 5 star all the way! The managers were warm and friendly even serving us our entrees. The staff was knowledgeable and fun and encouraged us to take our time and enjoy!!!  The decor of Morels is a little dull. I could see how it would fly in LA but in Las Vegas you expect a bit more due to the fact that everything is on a  grander scale here. I think sitting on the patio on a warm night would be a whole different story but as far the inside it just lacked that \"little extra something\" I hate to even say a negative thing about this place because I would most certainly  recommend Morels to anyone. We loved it and had a fantastic evening It was memorably fabulous!!!",

I told the server what I liked and didn't like and he brought out 3 cheeses, two of which I absolutely loved. If you like goat cheese, the Chabichou (sp?) is a must. Great flavor, not too funky and very rich. My favorite thing at breakfast was the smoked salmon and the coffee, I think I had the Nicaraguan, I liked it because it had a nice, rich True coffee flavor and wasn't the yucky tangy kind that you get at some places (I loathe Green Mountain coffee). My other favorite breakfast place is Bouchon, but mainly for pastries. The service is usually very good, but the waiter at dinner was a little snooty.",

When you pay $250 - $300 for dinner for 2 (with a bottle of wine), you expect them to be able to cook a steak correctly.  I ordered a bone in rib eye (I think...when you can't remember what kind of steak you ordered, that's telling you how memorable it was), medium rare, and it came out rare.  They took it back into the kitchen and cooked it some more.  Most of the steak came out medium rare, with some of the thinner part of the steak came out medium well.   The wait staff was attentive and professional, it was nice to have foie gras again, but i don't think we will be back.",

Just went with the All American breakfast which is pretty much 2 eggs, toast, and your choice of meat (sausage, bacon, etc.) We did order the Sugar Doughnuts. Wow. Amazing! The waitstaff was a little snooty but friendly enough to earn their tips.

I stopped at one point and asked myself if it was some cheep caned watery tuna, about two tablespoons for $30.. If this place is in the top ten restaurants in Vegas as advertised, they should shut the town down and quit. Pitiful just pitiful, and the side of asparagus was much better.

    "text": "When it comes to lunch or brunch in the Palazzo your choices are somewhat limited. After two awful experiences at Grand Lux we wanted to try something different and Morels did not disappoint.   Unfortunately our brunch did not start off on the right foot. We were made to wait for our table to be seat up which was odd, considering the restaurant was empty and it appeared that all of the tables were already set up. Upon seating us the hostess gave a little big of an attitude when we commented that it took a little long to set up tables in what appeared to be an empty and ready restaurant.   Other than the 'tude from the hostess everything else was fantastic. It's a shame too because I would have probably given them 5 stars if not for her. Our server was great, very attentive, very nice. My mimosa was perfectly made and they also offer a Bloody Mary bar.   My eggs benedict were fantastic, as were the order of pommes frites that I ordered as a side. (How do you go to a French restaurant and not try the pommes frites?) My husband loved his Croque Monsieur. The rest of my dining companions enjoyed their brunch as well. The stuffed French toast was tempting and I would definitely order it on a return trip. Brunch entrees were priced on the more expensive side when compared to a place in your hometown, but they were on par with hotel pricing.",

I ordered a cocktail with a lime - it came to the table - they whisked it out of my hand and handed me another drink - with a lemon.... Okaaayyyy.  I ordered the filet mignon medium rare - it came blood raw... I sent it back - and all they did was re-fire the same piece of meat - which was a subpar piece to begin with.... Having already cut it made it very dry when they served it to me again.  When I pay for a $60 small filet - cooked right and not dry would be nice.  The bernaise was horrible - there was one flake of tarrigon in the cold oniony goo.  And I guess there must be more than one person dining at a table to be served bread - which the people literally sitting right next to me - let me know that it was really good... I guess I'll take their word for it.  So... One cocktail, one glass of house cab, one small filet, one baked potato plain, one serving of bernaise = an even $100.00.  Do not waste your money here. If the food was worth it - even with getting everything wrong with that simple order - maybe... However, the food just is not cooked well.",

Hubby ordered the Fish and Chips.   The  Benedict was very tasty although it could have used more crab in it for the money we paid.  The hollandaise sauce was not the usual as per it's name it had a delicious citric flavor.   The hubby's fish and chips were okay, not the greatest but not that bad. The 3 cheese appetizer with the honeycomb and date nut spread was outstanding.   There was over 20 cheese to pick from and the presentation was beautiful. The waiter was very helpful in selection of the cheeses. Hubby's ice tea was fresh but for a more upscale restaurant, they should have kept refilling it as he had to ask a couple of times for more. All in all, we would come back.",

Despite the lack of activity in the restaurant, it still took them 20 minutes to even hand us menus.  It then took another 20 minutes to even get bread for the table and for our waiter to take our order.  The steaks were also cooked very inconsistently.  My brother's steak was so undercooked that he had to send it back twice to be re-fired.    To top it off, at the end of the night, our waiter claimed that he could only accept 3 credit cards (we had a group of 10).  It's just shocking that a restaurant in an upscale hotel could be so technologically-challenged.  You'd think that a restaurant would make it easy for you to pay them for their services.    Needless to say, I'd never go back there and encourage anyone who reads this review to find an alternative steakhouse in Vegas.",

We were seated right away and waited on - meticulously - by three people throughout brunch.  We were three women and the gentlemen waiters were helpful, polite and prompt.  The brunch menu looked divine, but I'm a sucker for cheese.  I was impressed by the selection of cheeses and charcuterie.  I talked my friends into having cheese fondue with me.  Yes, for brunch.  So there.  The fondue arrived and was the perfect balance of wine and cheese.  Neither was too strong.  It was a symphony of taste that I never wanted to end.  The bread was crusty and soft, fresh and fragrant.  SO GOOD.  The coffee was strong - a fair trade Rwandan blend - and I loved it.  Then we shared the fries with the seasoned mayonnaise (divine!), a plate of saucisson (a dry salame thing made in France, that I love) and a smoked salmon flat bread.  The saucisson was sliced wafer thin and served with more yummy bread, sweet cornichons, pearl onions and a fancy, stone-ground mustard.  My tummy was full and my heart was singing in tune with my taste buds.  Great atmosphere, comfy chairs, right on the strip with indoor (what we opted for) and outdoor seating.  Check this place out.  I *will* try their dinner menu on a future trip to Vegas... but I am craving their spectacular brunch.  And, next time, I *will* sample something off the delightful Bloody Mary cart.",

We were told that happy hour is either on the sweltering hot deck overlooking the strip or at the bar.  We opted for the empty bar to partake of the 2 for 1 drinks.

Still, pretty unacceptable since I could go to a Chili's and everybody would be able to have a more affordable meal and be able to pay with credit cards if you wanted to.  My meal that was the seafood variety was pretty good, and the bread was good, but that was about it in terms of having quality food from an expensive place like this. My friends had steaks that were very mediocre, and we ordered four sides that got cold pretty quick, the best thing probably being the french fries.  We went around 9:30PM, so maybe the staff was tired. You don't pay $50 expecting for your meal to be less than stellar, including a rather underwhelming experience for a restaurant on the strip. May be better for a smaller group, because it was horrible for us.",

The field green salad tossed in balsamic vinaigrette was really big for being an appetizer, was also very tasty.  The skirt steak frites was a delicious dish, loved the steak seasoning and the fries.  I ordered medium temp. and I happily received my steak as ordered.  Vanilla bean ice cream was delicious.  The service could use a little help...I can't exactly put my finger on it, but something was lacking.",

Location is awesome being in the Pallazzo and restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating......separate bar area and the formal dining area.  Decor and ambience is awesome!!  Not too noisy and not dead quiet.  Perfect for business meetings and perfect for anniversaries.  You just cant go wrong here.  Services are super and waiters are extremely attentive.  You have at all time minimum of 2 waiters at your disposal at anytime.  Have their own head cheese master that is exellent and super knowledgeable on all the cheeses they have.  Food from apettizers of oysters to the lovely dry aged steaks are just to die for with the mushroom sauce.  I dont like the American charboiled burnt style steak, so this French style prepped steak is my all time favorite.  Best steak I ever tasted is here and that is why I keep going back every single time I come to Vegas!!  I come here religiously every few months when in town!!  Well worth the drive there or the flight there and the stay there and the money spent!!  Writing this review is making me want to drive there this weekend from LA........  Decor:  4.5 out of 5 Ambience:  5 out of 5 Service:  5 out of 5 Food:  5 out of 5 Repeatable:  NO DOUBT and I HAVE!!",

The front of house was just making a shift change and service was a little slow to get started. We ordered some oysters, of which a few were definitely sad excuses for Kumamotos served to customers at $35+ for a dozen.   We also got a Caesar for 2 which was a nice table side presentation and no complaints there.  We shared a prime rib eye as our entree and it was a decent steak.  I asked for medium rare and I would say the temperature was a bit uneven with the middle rare and the exterior a bit more well.  Seems like an issue with not letting the steak come to temp before cooking or just a by product of uneven heat in the broiler or pan.  Overall the steak was good though and came with a nice salt selection and a side of sauce bordelaise.    The service was mixed as one of our lead servers was great and the other lady was just trying to upsell everything which is always a turnoff.    Come here if you are at the Palazzo, otherwise there are plenty of other options that are better and more worth your money.",

For our main dishes, we had the petit filet and the rib eye. Both steaks were delicious, can't say the same for the Mac n cheese side, but the taste of everything else made up for it. I gave this place only a 4 because the waiter had a few missteps, but I won't judge the entire experience on him.",

I'm giving it 2 stars only because my 18 hour braised short ribs were pretty decent ... It would have been better had it not been COLD. When they said \"18-hour braised\" I didn't think they meant it would feel like 18 hours had passed before you got your food.  My entire party's food was cold. We had ordered some drinks and wine, and had to wait at least half an hour for us to get our drinks. Some of them got the wrong drink order and some drinks given to the wrong people. I supposed when it takes you that long to get a drink, you tend to forget whose drink belongs to whom -__-  still, I'm pretty sure it doesn't take that long to get wine. I mean.. 1)open bottle 2) pour 3) serve.  Service was AWFUL. It didn't seem like the waiters really knew what they were doing. They offered to split our checks, and at the end of the night, said they couldn't. Maybe because they knew they were already going to get gratuity?? (Our party was 6+) who knows. The table next to us were seated after us and they got their good before us. The staff looked like they were running around like headless chickens not really doing anything. The place didn't even seem that busy.   Definitely not coming back here unless I had the whole day to wait for mediocre food and an extra $100 lying around that I really NEED to get rid of--for a plate of food that I could easily get at the Cheesecake Factory for a quarter of the price.",

    "text": "We came to Vegas for a friend's birthday celebration and chose Morels for her surprise birthday dinner.  All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).    The service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.  We ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.  The bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.  All in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here.",

It was really empty since we were the first ones there for lunch. But service was still pretty slow throughout the entire meal. -1 star there. But I really enjoyed the food!  Had the oysters for appetizer, very fresh and pretty fatty. For the main course, I had the Pan Sauteed Sole which was excellent. The accompaniment with the spinach, vegetables, and the SAUCE! Oh my gosh I think the sauce was what made the dish excellent (and of course the fish was perfectly cooked so it's very tender).   My sister had the steak frites which I thought was great too. She thought it was too well-done and even though I agree with her, the taste was great and because it was a thin steak that it wasn't too tough.   Overall I liked the food and I will definitely return just for the sole if I'm craving for fish. But it's not one of the must. I would probably invest my time in another French restaurant in Vegas. Honestly speaking.. the price for the food and the quality you get might not be equal. So another -1 star there.",

Our experience started off on the wrong foot when we made a reservation using OpenTable, checked in at the restaurant stating we had a reservation and then got seated.  Immediately I received an email that our reservation was canceled even though we just were seated at Morels.  I discussed with the hostess and the manager and they said it was a computer glitch, so they had to cancel the reservation.  Too long of a story, but never truly handled the situation properly.  The patio was nice and the decor inside was cool, but the service was not attentive and the food really was not good, especially for the price.  Eggs Benedict for $17 and not good = me not happy!  The omelette had egg shells in it and I told the waiter, but they didn't seem to care.    The manager's way of making it \"right\" was to send a dessert to our table - chocolate and peanut butter.  It was just ok too.  There are so many other dining options in Vegas, so need to check this place out...you will just be disappointed!",

    "text": "I had very high expectations of this place after reading a number of reviews via Yelp, unfortunately this was not a favorable experience.  We ordered the escargot and shrimp scampi which was pretty good as appetizers.  I ordered the Bone In Filet medium rare, but it came out medium well to well done.  Our waiter took it back to have another re-cooked, the manager offered another glass of wine for me.  The 2nd time it came out, it was rare.  So they had to take it back again for a 3rd time and cooked it well, if I wanted beef jerky I could have gone to 7-11.  We also ordered the rib eye medium rare, but it came out rare as well.    By the time I got my food, everyone was done with their dinner and the sides (steamed asparagus, puree de pommes & sauteed seasonal mushrooms) were cold, though they did bring out another mashed potato dish.    I love steahouses and was looking forward to going to Morel's for well over 1 month, but unfortunately I will never go back.  When you go a place like this, the expectations are very high.  To have my steak taken back 3 times is unheard of and inexcusable for such an establishment.     I hope that if you do go, you have a better experience than I did.",

Nothing too extravagant or flashy, which was kind of nice for a strip restaurant.    The menu drink menu is great.  As a whiskey snob, I was happy to see all my favorites included on the menu.  Of course overpriced, but good choices nonetheless.  They also had one of the most extensive cheese lists i've seen in town.  I sadly did not partake, but oh did I want to.    The restaurant week prix fixe menu included onion soup, a tomato/mozzarella salad, choice of halibut or new york strip, and profiteroles for dessert.  All the food was prepared perfectly, yet none of it stood out as unique in my mind.  I suppose this went along with the decor... upscale yet modest, nothing too flashy.    Although nothing at all was wrong with my visit here, I just wasn't wowed like I have been at some other amazing vegas restaurants.  For the price, i'll be checking out some other places in town before I return here.",

Salads: Husband ordered a single caesar, and i ordered the iceberg salad with bleu cheese. the caesar had no croutons which is weird, isnt that a staple? and my salad was just bad all together. there was hardly any bacon, and the bacon that was there was hard as a rock and super greasy.  my husband wanted to eat light, so he ordered the crab cocktail for his entree, and i decided to get the halibut. his crab cocktail was not fresh, and most likely came from a can. my halibut, was bad. bad bad bad. it smelled very fishy, and im pretty sure it was tilapia! we shared the potato dauphin (scalloped with bread crumbs and cheese) and those werent too bad.  overall, it was pretty bad. we ordered fried artichokes too, and just by looking at them you could tell they were frozen and they tasted so bad i spit them out. even the waiter knew they were bad! he said they get that complaint all the time!  go else where! the worst $130 ive ever spent on dinner.",

The friends that got steak were served large portions.  The only reason I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 is because of the service. drinks came in wrong and with 5 different servers per table I thought it took a while to ask someone for some extra water or when they served all the food and there was no silverware on the table.

Our waiter, I believe his name starts with the letter J, took forever to get to our table to greet us even though there were only a total of about 4 tables with people sitting at them in the entire restaurant. He then took forever to get our menus.  Then he disappeared. Water refills were done by his assistant. Requests for EVERYTHING, including the check, we made of his assistant. J, meanwhile, was goofing off on the outdoor patio with his colleagues.   Coffee? His assistant took the order and delivered it.   Guess who got the tip? Yep, his assistant.

The decor was classy.  Our waiter, Richard, gave us excellent service!  He was very nice and always checked to see if we were okay.  At the end of our meal, he said goodbye and shook our hand. I saw that with other waiters as well.  I am not sure if it was customary in this restaurant or if it was just coincidental, but that was pleasantly different :)  We had the summer tasting menu and I guess depending on what you choose for each course you may or may not think it was worth the price.  I chose the fried shrimp for my appetizer and it was literally  \"a single shrimp\".  The salad with nectarines was yummy.  Unfortunately, the size of filet mignon was the tiniest I've ever seen.  At most, it was 3 inches x 3 inches and no more then 1/2 inches thick.  They placed it on top of a toasted piece of bread to make it look thicker.  Even my 10 year old would go hungry with this.  Luckily, the coconut panna cotta was yummy so that was a good ending to this meal.  My last negative...the restroom.  There was no toilet paper in the dispenser in my stall, but there was a bunch of toilet paper rolls on top of the tank and 1 on the floor.  In a fine dine restaurant, they should just check the restroom every hour because I dont think any of us customers will be placing them on the toilet paper dispenser (especially since this is a public bathroom where I try not to touch the surroundings.",

The meats were cooked to perfection and soooooooo tender and juicy.  The sides of mushrooms, potatos, mac and cheese, and brocolli with a  tangy hollandaise sauce complemented the meats like white on rice......  The service was super-excellent...........!!!!!!!

The suite that we had booked at the Palazzo came with a 20% off brunch, lunch, or dinner at Morels and we figured that we would try it.  Honestly, I was less than pleased with my experience.  From the get-go, it was bad.  The hostesses were a little brusque and seemed disinterested in seating us even though the restaurant was virtually empty.  She even tried to seat us at a table directly facing the incoming sunlight instead of moving us to a booth in a further location away from the glare.  We had to ask her to move us and she sighed, implying that it was a hard thing to ask of her.  It was extremely frustrating.  The wait staff was nicer and were very accommodating to our complete ignorance of their menu and specialty cheese.  I ordered the chef's special short-rib ($52) and the rest of my table had a gran plateau ($145!!!), which is a whole assortment of the \"chilled seafood.\"  This included ceviche, shrimp, oysters, 1/2 a dungeonous crab, and a lobster.    Frankly, the food was alright but definitely below my expectations, especially for the prices they were charging!   The short rib was tender but something I could have cooked at home.  Nothing very special.  And the chilled seafood tasted as if the seafood had been sitting in the freezer for a while.  Again, not all that special.  Overall, the food and price was not good.  The decor did not salvage this place either.  There was no harmony to the place.  The blue and gray theme gave an air of depression and the lighting was less than perfect.  The booths' hanging lights were very classy and appropriate, but the lights outside of the booths were morose and in a dark washed cherry wood.  It clashed horribly since half the restaurant was themed modernly and the other half was Victorian/classic.    Though it was an experience, I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone.",

It took 40 minutes for us to get our first glass of wine, despite numerous staff and a very small number of patrons.  Our first bottle of wine was brought to out table opened.  At a restaurant of supposedly this caliber, that is a big faux pas.  The manager then proceeded to try to convince us to drink it anyway - and explained that it was their last bottle and the other comparable ones are too expensive for them to honor the price they quoted us.  We had to send back our steaks once because they came before we even had our first glass of white (apperitif) delivered.  Our steaks came before our wine, and we had to ask for silverware.  Again, this would be fine at an Outback Steakhouse, but you shouldn't have to micromanage waiters at an upscale steakhouse to bring knives and plates.  To Add insult to injury, the filet mignonette came with a slightly astringent and gritty \"dry rub\" of \" a ton of ingredients\" including rosemary, cumin and cayenne pepper.  At $52/8oz filet that is not what you expect at a steakhouse.  At a minimum you should indicate the spice blend on the menu (waiter confirmed it is not mentioned).  The waiters apologized profusely, and comped the wine, but I just can't seem to get the nasty taste out of my mouth from this experience.",

    "text": "My co-workers and I are in Vegas on a business trip; two of us are foodies. All of us really wanted a good steak, so we researched our options and decided on Morel's. Not being Vegas neophytes we didn't expect prices to be inexpensive, but info online indicated a good steak for $35 - $50.   We arrive around 8PM and are seated promptly. We are greeted right away and our waiter, Paul, was all over us pushing us to order right away. As we're reviewing the menu and prices, plus the cheese list, we figure out that the steaks start at $55 and go up from there. Guess you can't believe everything on the Net.    We ordered cheese so we could decide what else to have and ordered drinks. The drinks took a while to arrive; our waiter, who a short time before had been all over us trying to get us to order, now seemed to have no time for us, even though the dining room was not even 1/3 full.  Soon, a party of about 10 businessmen is seated near us. We three women become invisible. A dining experience that started off a little odd went thoroughly downhill from there. We weren't expense-account businesspeople, didn't order lots of very expensive wine and cocktails, didn't order expensive steaks. Having been in the business, I know how waiters think:  3 women, not spending much = poor tip.   Paul:  your tip would have been great had you not decided that we weren't worth your time.  We ordered a drink that never came, waited an hour for entrees, had empty beer bottles on our table - certainly not service that lived up to the high prices. I complained to Paul the waiter, who then declined to look at us again until time to drop the check. He did send the manager over who apologized, comped a round of drinks and bought dessert. In the meantime, entrees arrive, and the salmon entree one of us ordered was inedible. So we sent it back and declined to re-order, figuring it would take another hour and 1/2 for any more food to arrive. Paul the waiter decided he could talk to us again after the manager gave us dessert and more drinks, but by then the damage was done.  Folks, I give this one a \"don't even bother\". Anyplace would have had better service, better food and somewhat less stratespheric prices. What a disappointment.",

    "text": "Start to finish, Morels provided a wonderful meal and experience. Morels is located near the lobby. Park near the entrance closest to the check in desk will make finding the restaurant easier. I made a reservation for 6:00pm, but my friend and I got there early. It was not a problem and we were seated without delay.  Our server, Mike, was amazing. He gave us great suggestions on wine and dinner options. He came by often enough to let us know that he was around, but kept away while we were eating or talking. When he got a chance to visit, he was funny and entertaining. Waters were refilled at half glass and food came out in a nice even flow. The service is definitely one of Morel's strong points.  My friend and  started with a cheese board. The ten year aged cheddar with salt crystals was magnificent with the fig spread and honey comb. Sweet and savory is always a winning combination. Paired with a Syrah, I was in heaven. A great start that was about to get better with a half dozen of the kumamoto oysters each. They were fresh, briny, and succulent. It was so hard not to suck them all back. Yet the wisest choice was to savor them. Next, I got the fresh fig and arugula salad. I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but it balanced out the sweetness of the figs well. This dish had everything. It was creamy from the cheese, crunchy from the walnuts, sweet from the figs, salty cheese, spicy from the arugula, and perfectly dressed. Could this meal get any better? It sure can with a medium rare 14oz. 28 day aged grass fed NY sirloin. The steak needed very little. It comes out with three selections of salt and a few granules is all it needs. The black salt had a nice smokiness to it. To finish our meals, we got a scoop of black currant and green apple ice cream, as well as the vanilla almond profiteroles. The large list of ice cream flavors is impressive. They have a mixture of common favorites and some innovative flavors. Some that caught my eye was the orange honey, pear, black currant, and green apple. The profiteroles came with a side of warm chocolate sauce in a small container to ladle out on your own. There was no semi-sweet chocolate left when I was done. The candied almond slivers was a nice touch for decoration and tasty too.  I can not rave any more highly about my experience at Morel's. So FIN!",

    "text": "We ate at Morel's on a Sunday evening and had a great experience.  The service is excellent.  Our waiter was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, but didn't hover.  We decided to order a cheese tray and let him pick various cheeses for us to try.  It was fantastic!  In fact, I would say that the cheese tray was one of the highlights of our meal there.  Everyone seemed happy with their entrees (braised short rib, salmon, filet mignon.)  We also ordered a couple of side dishes of the truffle macaroni and cheese.  (I didn't care for the flavor, but my guests seemed to like it.)  Overall, it was a very good dining experience.  I am deducting a couple of stars because of the price.  Dinner for 4 (not including alcohol) was over $300.  The food was good but there are plenty of great restaurants in Vegas and I didn't feel like Morel's rises to the level of other restaurants in this price range  (e.g. Bradley Ogden at Caesar's, Picasso at Bellagio and Charlie Trotter at Palazzo).",

Can't you just feel that sometimes? Lord ya can sense it.  Why don't I trust myself knowing that I am going to get sticker ass shocked in the end.? $50.00, yes...FIFTY dollars a glass for a stingy-ass pour of GD Merlot.  Good grief!  I liked the cheese thing, but honestly? I was expecting something for dinner that would make my senses perk.  The only thing that perked was my ass when I got the check.  Sorry chef what's your name but a course at the CIA just might be in order, and re-address the food portion.  Frankly, there are other choices in Vegas that are a far better deal for the wallet and the palette..",

It was evenly seasoned, with a small scooplet of butter sitting on top, and was True to size.  I also recommend the sauteed seasonal mushrooms, and both the beet salad and the papaya salad.  Minus 1 star for the hostess who, after initially trying to seat the 4 of us in a far corner of the dining area, was surprisingly hesistant when we requested to sit closer to the French doors -- and, therefore, the sunlight.  We went on a Monday evening so the place was almost empty, yet she was still reluctant.  After a few minutes she finally said ok but still wouldn't sit us quite where we requested.  Bizarre.",

    "text": "The service for our group of 12 was okay.  We were there for the prix fixe \"Dinner & a Show\" menu, and I took off stars because 1) The staff didn't manage the timing very well and we were late to our Blue Man Group showing at 8PM, and 2) They gave me and the boyfriend someone ELSE's bag of leftovers (we didn't think to check to see if our TWO delicious, juicy medium RARE sirloins were in our bag; it wasn't until later when we were about to refrigerate the meat that we saw only ONE steak in there, and it was a flat, sad-looking, medium WELL bone-in something.  So much for our plan with the leftovers!).  But other than that, our servers were generally courteous and kept our drinks topped off, even though one was utterly thrown by my request for a \"house non-alcoholic drink\" (I was on meds).  He acted like it was a hardship, but I didn't back down, and luckily the bartender came up with something delicious.  Food gets 4 stars.  Not the best, but certainly better than average.  My French Onion Soup was probably the best and biggest I've had (the cheese was tasty and stringy, not rubbery, all melted on top of the toasted slice of bread), while my enormous 14oz sirloin (standard size) was good and cooked to my liking, but I felt like they added an unneeded sauce or something.  I did enjoy the mashed potatoes.  Loved the dessert of 3 different creme brulees (my favorite two were the pistachio and the vanilla bean), but unfortunately no one at my table was able to get more than half down because like I said, they kept us too long and we missed the beginning of our show.  The atmosphere was pretty interesting in its variety.  Definitely upscale, but I liked the fact that to get to the dining room, you have to walk by an appealing glass case stocked with gourmet cheeses.  Hung on the walls of the pale blue room with dark wooden trim were large erotic paintings (no body parts were shown, but the positions of the men and women more than hinted at what was going on).  The patio looked immediately across the street to Treasure Island, so those folks were treated to the fireworks display.  The black chandeliers were vampish, which I thought was cool.  As the evening wore on, the large space with high ceilings got pretty dark.  Bathrooms were nice and pretty much what you'd expect.  Won't be back as there are other restaurants to try out, but I'm glad we did give it a chance.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying we love Morels in Los Angeles, and have eaten there a dozen times. We love the steak but especially their fondue this time of year. We decided that fondue for Christmas sounded perfect, so I made reservations for 7:30 at the Morels at the Palazzo. We arrived at 7:25 and we're told our table would be ready shortly, so we took a seat at the bar and waited...and waited...and waited...until we were finally seated at 8:05. No apology, nothing at all. The waiter greeted us and brought some bread rolls, he asked if we had been to Morels before and we said we had on several occasions and we told him we were looking forward to the fondue. He asked if we were planning on ordering the fondue and we said yes. He left and said he'd be back. After disappearing for several minutes, I had to flag him down so we could place our drink and food order. We finally ordered our drinks, an order of bruschetta, and the fondue. He told us he'd already placed the order for the fondue. OK. 5 minutes later the fondue arrives...it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks, and still no bruschetta. Now, I love the fondue at Morels, and having grown up in Switzerland I know fondue...this was terrible, it was so bland and flavorless. To make matters worse half way through the meal the flame under the pot went out, and by the time they replaced the base the cheese had now become a cold, hard ball of bland cheese. The bread rolls tasted as if they came straight out of a plastic bag. They did bring us a cheese and an olive spread which was probably the best part of the meal. We were seriously disappointed, and on Christmas it all just seemed even worse. We will absolutely return to Morels at the Grove, but this Vegas Grinch ruined Christmas. In fact, we were so disappointed we skipped dessert...and I LOVE dessert. This location compares to the LA location the same way Paris Hotel resembles the Paris in France.",

    "text": "I started a new December tradition this year--having breakfast on Christmas Day and New Year's Day somewhere on the Las Vegas Strip preferably with a patio and hopefully no wind.  I've been going to try Morels during Restaurant Week but never got to it.  I called last week to check that the patio was open for breakfast and that it was heated.  The woman I spoke to said, \"Oh yes!  It's very nice.\"  I was there close to opening time this morning.  When I went in, I asked the host if the patio was open.  He said, \"Yes, but it's cold out.\"  I replied that I knew and I had dressed warmly.  I was shown to a table facing TI.  During the 45 or so minutes I was there, I had no company on the patio and the heaters were not on nor were any turned on for my benefit.  Having read the Yelp reviews and the menu online, I think I knew when I went I would be ordering the mascarpone stuffed French toast.  I also got the Kenya AA Oaklands Estate coffee that was done in a French press.  I got a glass of tomato juice and some tabasco to make my spicy breakfast drink.  The French toast was excellent.  When I ordered, my server, Carlos, asked if I wanted the syrup on the side which was my choice.  The French toast is a nice sized round of tasty bread filled with mascarpone and topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, and a few raspberries.  The cinnamon on the toast and some crunchy sugar on the berries added to the fine flavor.  The syrup was good, but I could use it sparingly the French toast was so good.  Carlos brought me a second pot of coffee and I enjoyed sitting there watching the workers do some painting of the walls.  I hadn't seen any graffiti from New Year's Eve partiers, but maybe they were just cleaning up some foot prints where people jumped the wall to get to the closed Boulevard.  I would have given Morels four stars but for the heaters.  When you call ahead and get a yes answer and then it's not True and no one offered to light the one right behind me, it's a service let down for me.  Carlos was a fine server and we talked about where he had parked NYE so he could get to work and back to his car with the street closures.  He gave me some tips I'll put to use next year when I do go to the Boulevard or close instead of watching on TV.",

Aside from the classic, I also got pistachio creme brulee and salted caramel creme brulee. I like variety so this was perfect. So creamy and wonderful with the burnt sugar on top. My favorite out of the 3 was the caramel. The hazelnut cookie was a nice touch, It added crisp to a creamy dessert. So good. 4.5/5",

We waited over an hour for our food before we left with still receiving no food. We were one of the only tables there but our IDIOT waiter didn't do shit. He pretty much talked about his Gonzaga basketball team instead of serving us food/water. Blah, blah, blah....hey dude, we could care less about your boring team. Just bring us the food and be done with it. We literally watched a guy right next to us sit down, order a burger and finish and pay before our food came. We asked the wet piece of bread of a man why we'd been waiting for over an hour and he gave a 5th grader attitude response of \"it hasn't even been an hour, trust me.\"   Let's just say I'd never expect to get so much pleasure walking out of a restaurant and see his dumb face react when we did",

Bottomless mimosas are a great value for only  $25.  My server kept bringing them over.  My boyfriend got coffee which I tried and it was amazing.  They serve French press which isn't so common at alot of places.  For dessert the creme brule is a must!",

    "text": "Well, we should've gone to Bouchon.   I met up with a friend at Morels for breakfast. Lately, we've been on a French food kick and have been breakfasting at various French restaurants; Morels was next on our list. Essentially, it's a 2-Star dining establishment that can be ranked alongside Denny's and Ihop. I'm not insulting those establishments, but why would anyone pay good money for that kind of food? If I wanted Denny's, I would've gone there. The food was definitely not worth the caloric intake and the cash withdrawal from my wallet, but at least Morels will never receive business from me again.  Market Fresh Seasonal Fruit ($11): \"Market Fresh\", yeah right, far from it. The plate consisted of a mix of melons, several pineapple slices, a SINGLE strawberry that was sliced up for us to share, and some random blueberries for \"garnish.\" In the center of the plate was a bowl of plain yogurt. We also received some honeycomb that was less than a teaspoon.  Free Range Egg Crab Omelette ($19): I chose this over the Croque Madame, which I originally wanted to try; however, I can't say if sticking to my original decision would've changed my experience. The omelette comes with a choice of either a house salad or Country Breakfast Potatoes. I'm not exaggerating when I say that my entire meal was bland. I even had my friend try some of my food to make sure my taste buds were functioning. Both my potatoes and omelette desperately needed seasoning. I don't like adding salt and pepper to the food that I order, but this could've been the first restaurant meal where I was about to do so, except we didn't have any salt and pepper on our table. I did request some Dijon mustard. That somewhat added some life to my meal, but Dijon wasn't suited for it. On a positive note: there was real crab meat in my omelette.   Crab Eggs Benedict ($20) This was what my friend ordered. The presentation of her dish almost made me regret having ordered my omelette, but it was all looks. Her order was also flavorless and lacked seasoning.   Costa Rican Pressed Coffee ($5): Decent for being a $5 cup 'o joe. It's robust and had more flavor than what I ate.  The service is in need of improvement, and it isn't up to the quality I'd expect from a dining establishment at The Palazzo. We should've considered the chair with the hole in its back, and the awkwardness of the service staff -- specifically, the busser, who lurked around our table.  Lastly, if you make an Open Table reservation, double check that you're awarded your dining points. Morels failed to add 100 points to my account.   I said it in the beginning of this review, and I'll say it again: We should've gone to Bouchon.",

We also tried the truffle Mac and cheese and I thought it was not good at all. The rib eye was very tender and yummy. But the sides all come a la carte and the $10 mashed potatoes my husband ordered tasted like pre made microwave food! The wait staff was extremely friendly and willing to accommodate us.

Well, we were still sitting there at 7:30 waiting for our food and it wasn't like we ordered a lot of appetizers or salads to start.  Tables that came in after us were done before us and granted we had a party of 10, but if you can't handle that large of a table, don't offer them!  Our server was also possibly new, but was enthusiastic and was trying his best. We were confused when asking for recommendations and had 2 different servers give completely different reviews of what is on the menu.  We also  noticed a lot of staff just standing around, so it appears that maybe part of the problem is management.  The \"family size\" sides are very small, certainly not large enough for more than 3-4 people to share. The food was just okay so for the amount of money we were spending we've definitely had better!  We had reservations to see a show at 8:30 thinking we would have plenty of time so we ended up eating as fast as possible and running out to get a cab.  No special desert or mention of my son's birthday and no offer to comp anything on the bill.  Big disappointment-wouldn't eat there again and would never recommend it!",

We got our coffee and our server was very attentive in refilling our cups. Took our order, then eventually came over to drop off our meal which was just an average breakfast. Nonetheless, we were really excited to get our fruit and doughnuts. Our Server returns to let us know that they run out of \"doughnuts\" so instead the chef made us \"Creme Brulee\" instead at 10am?  Which was weird of him to not mention at the beginning of our meal. I also asked if our fruit would be coming and he said that it was \"choice\" of one or the other. Clearly he was mistaken, but I didn't feel like arguing since I was so disappointed about the house doughnuts. This place is definitely an upscale restaurant, but I was very disappointed in their service and will more than likely not return to try their regular menu since they can't even get their breakfast right.",

    "text": "What a miserable overpriced experience. We should have known when we were able to get last minute reservations on a Saturday night. I have had lunch here before and do not remember the service being so sub par. Overall the food was adequate. Nothing special, and certainly not worth the price, even for Vegas. There are so many other better steakhouses within walking distance. It was the service, and how we were treated by the manager that capped off a miserable night. As we were being seated, I noticed a couple leaving without having ordered, that was the first clue. First, everything  was brought out at the same time. I kid you not. Appetizer, salad, soup, sides, and steak. I wonder if they would have brought out coffee and desert had we put that order in also. I really am not exaggerating. They all came out at the same time without any explanation. However, the person ordering the soup was not given a spoon. After dropping off the food, no one came back by to check on us. We flagged down a busboy after 5 minutes and he went to get a spoon. He must have been distracted as he did not come back, but a few minutes later he dropped off two spoons to the couple next to us who had just ordered. I got up, found our waiter and had a spoon brought over, almost ten minutes after the food was brought out. With the waiter now at our table, we ordered a second round of drinks, only to have a lemon drop spilled on the poor woman who had been forced to wait on the spoon.  After that, the next server who came by was a good 20 minutes clearing our plates. At this time I asked for the manager. One would think he would come over on his own, but then again. After explaining the situation, he said he would \"tap dance on our bill,\" and commented on \"how nice and easygoing we were with the situation.\" when the doused patron mentioned that her satin blouse was likely ruined, his reply \"send me dry-cleaning bill.\"  Wow. I was little surprised at how flippant he was. Maybe he made the assumption we could be blown off easily as we where so laid back about it. Here's the kicker, he took the spilled drink, the cold soup, and $25 off the bill. A cab back to our hotel to change before going out was more than that. Things happen, but what a miserable experience, and any respectable owner would have handled the situation with better care.",

Wouldn't order it again. What did peak my interest was their extensive cheese list, I would like to come back and just try some cheese and wine out on the patio. Also, they have happy hour from 12-6p, drink specials, and from 12-4p food.",

I had a great experience here.  The steaks here were very well executed (on par with any good steak house u would expect, but also not the best steak I ever tasted).  The thing that really makes this place very worth the visit is the amazing wine selection they have.  From bottles to wines by the glass, they have a great amount of choice for any type of wine preference.  The side dishes were also all cooked very well.  I highly recommend coming here if you are in the area or staying at the hotel and in the mood for a french steak dinner with some awesome wine.",

Our waiter was very arrogant and seemed put off that we needed 15-20 minutes to order since we were socializing for work instead.   I ordered a $50+ filet that had very little taste, somewhat dry and the topping I paid $8 for was a quarter-size piece of blue cheese.  Weak!  No one at our table was happy with their meal and my co-workers from a country overseas even refused to tip the waiter the service and meal was so below average.  I have never done that in my life and still gave 15% (normally 20%+ for me)...",

    "text": "On a trip to Las Vegas recently with my boyfriend, we were wandering through the shops at the Venetian, and I saw a sign for \"Date Night\" at 7 restaurants in the Venitian and the Palazzo.  We weren't sure if we were going to do it, but later that day we decided to check on it, and sure enough we thought it sounded fun, and Morels sounded the best out of what we like, so we went for it.  The \"Date Night\" is some sort of Prix Fixe menu (3 courses for $40) on Wed-Fri until sometime in mid April.  We got there and the place seemed very nice.  Looking at the three courses, we were amazed at the deal we were probably getting since one of the items on the Fixe menu was $38 by itself.  We both got the menu, and we ordered some cheese as a cheese course between the entree and the desert.  For those who don't know, there is a ridiculous cheese bar.  By ridiculous, I mean ridiculously awesome.  There are around 60 types of cheese, and just trying to choose some for sampling was overwhelming in its own right.  We ended up choosing some English Cheddar (because the bf is from England and complains about the American Cheddars), a strong blue, and some Camembert.  The Fixe menu consisted of three courses, soup or salad (he chose salad, I got soup), salmon (which looked a bit boring) or braised short rib (which we both got), and profiteroles or a lemon tart (I love lemons so went with the tart while he got the profiteroles).    The soup was amazing.  Seafood corn chowder.  Very rich and delicious.  I think my bf was jealous, but he wasn't going to say anything about it.  The entree was phenomenal.  Lately, all the short ribs I have had were super fatty, greasy piles of meat, and this one was fairly lean and just falling apart.  It was served with cauliflower puree, bacon, and a few vegetables.  The cheeses were to die for.  I could go back here on any trip to Vegas just to get some cheese.  We also got some prosciutto with the cheese and some sweet and spicy almonds.  The almonds were quite tasty, and the meat was divine.  The cheeses were served with fresh honeycomb and date puree, both of which went well with the cheese selection.  I also got some sweet wine to go with it, and it was amazing.  The ages port was also one of the best ports my bf has ever had.  The desserts were tasty, but not spectacular.  The two best things were the cheese and the short rib.  The service was great too.  Always attentive, and our water glasses were constantly being filled.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially if they are doing a Price Fixe event!",

Our steaks were good but for $46 per 8 ounces (and steakhouse in your name), meat needs to be excellent. I'd expect a little more flavor, and the steak knives were dull! The waiter even apologized and said, \"I think the steak sharper should come twice a month versus just once.\" Patio dining was nice. Good people watching. (The cheese list looked impressive but we took a pass.) Our waiter also didn't have solid knowledge of the wines by the glass. Is Vegas fine dining slipping across the board?",

Under new general management!!!  4ish stars for food/atmosphere/etc. 5 stars for service  Full disclosure: this was the \"let us make it up to you meal.\"  Constantin, the new general manager, saw my review on Yelp and contacted me to apologize for my terrible experience (the first True apology I received, mind you) and wanted us to come back so he could make it up to us and show us how Morels has changed.  He seemed very earnest and I'm fairly open minded, so off to Morels we were!  Constantin came right over after we were seated to say hello and thank us for trying them out again.  He briefly explained the menu he had planned for us and introduced Matt, our server.  Honestly, Matt seemed a bit nervous at first; I think he was concerned that we were super snotty or something, but after we chatted him up, he calmed down quite a bit and opened up a lot.  He was a good server and a cool guy!   On to the food: Amuse Bouche: Fresh Crab Salad on a homemade truffle potato chip.  Crab was excellent and the mixes of textures and salty/savory was great! Oysters: Yummy Kumamotos; super good, as would be expected.  (There are wine/champagne pairings in here, but I dont recall what they were; they matched wonderfully though!)  Appetizer: Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar: omg so good!  The quail egg and truffle chips were an excellent complement to the quality beef. I normally wouldn't order beef tartar, but I would order this again! Iron Cast Roasted Branzino: I was very impressed with this dish.  I'm not a huge cooked fish person, but I recently tried the branzino at Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles.  Angelini is a favorite of mine but I only tried the fish because Wolfgang Puck praised it on Best Thing I Ever Ate.  It was alright.  The branzino here at Morels was so good; cooked perfectly, nicely moist, and served with a nice beurre blanc.   Petite Cut Filet: Pretty good.  I enjoyed the quality of the meat and the preparation.  There is an interesting cumin-based rub they use that might scare off some diners; I liked it but it did overpower some bites for sure.  Our favorite cheesemonger, Jake (who is now a server) came by to see if we had any preferences and proceeded to hook us up with some amazing cheese.  Matt then had the gall to bring us dessert!!! I can't recall the name but it had some fresh fruit and a meringue mixture.  I'm not doing it justice, but it was a nice bite or so. I was far too full!  Before he left for the night, Constantin came to check on us one more time.  He was the consummate gentleman and totally made up for our previous experience.  While I 100% stand by my previous review, I'm sorry that we experienced Morels at such a down point (with the previous manager) and thought so poorly of the restaurant for so long.  Thanks Matt for being a great server! And, thank you to Constantin for having faith in us as customers to know good service and food when we see it.    We're very excited to go back!",

We had a full tasting menu with wine which gave us a much broader view of what Morels had to offer. Some of the highlights were the Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar and the Roasted Branzino. I love quail eggs and paired with the truffle chips the beef just popped with flavor.  The Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and had multiple layers of flavor with the skin intact. Of course the oysters and cheese selection is second to none. Both were great again and I would go back for that alone.   Our service was much improved and again it felt like a completely different experience than before. I love to see a place take our experiences and reviews seriously. If more restaurants took the lead like the new general manager they would truly start to understand their customers. I did not think a restuarant could change my opinion, but Morel's you have gained a customer back.",

    "text": "I want to give this place a higher rating because their cheese and seafood selection is so good, but seeing as how they bill themselves as a steakhouse - I just can't.  With that said, the grass-fed Kansas NY strip steak was completely average. I ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked properly, even though they've been known to have a hard time cooking a steak to a diner specifications. I had wanted to order some asparagus but they were out, so I got artichokes instead - these were only okay. So yeah, the steaks?  A total miss.  The seafood on the other hand... we got the seafood platter and it. was. phenomenal! The shrimp cocktail (which is usually just average) was the best I've ever had. The texture of the shrimp were just perfect, the chilled crab delightful and the oysters were fresh! They shuck them to order, and have a varied selection of sizes that span the east and west coast. These fresh fruits from the sea were served over crushed ice (how else?) accompanied by fresh lemon, mignonette (no shallots or black pepper to be found though), cocktail sauce and a whole grain mustard mayo. Wonderful!   They definitely boast the most fantastic cheese selection in Las Vegas. My only concern is that they do not seem busy enough to possibly sell enough cheese to be turning it over quickly. With cheese, as soon as you cut into a wheel, the quality of it begins to go down. However, everything I had was delicious, especially with the fresh baguette, house made date spread and honey comb.  The charcuterie platter was equally delicious and a fantastic savory compliment with whole grain mustard, cocktail onions and cornichons! Mmm. Cured meats are my kryptonite.  I was informed by a former manager of the restaurant that Morel's had the best French Onion soup in town.. I found this to not be so. It arrived at the table not quite hot enough, not enough cheese, although the broth was robust it still seemed to be lacking something. If you're there and it's what you're craving, then okay.. but definitely not worth going out of your way for.  The pistachio souffle with cherry ice cream was more than worth the wait and I'd highly recommend it! I'm a sucker for a good souffle, and Morel's can do theirs right.  The wine list is also worth a mention as it is varied and lengthy and well thought out with a lot of interesting bottles. If you find the list intimidating, their French sommelier Alex will be more than happy to help you find something you'll adore.",

I almost didn't bother coming because I was still so full from lunch.  But I am so glad I made it.    They had opened the back section of the restaurant for the participants.  We sat wherever we could find seats at.  It wasn't that crowded so we found 2 empty seats across from another couple.  We could basically order any drinks we wanted including wine, but since I don't drink (yeah, what a shame!), I ordered a lemonade and my fiance ordered a diet coke.    We were handed a pre-fixe menu with a choice of Entree for either Filet Mignon or Salmon.  First course was BIBB LETTUCE & CRAB SALAD with Orange & Tarragon Vinaigrette. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=-_AYLlBo9zLgLEQqgaon_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a> The dressing was really light.  It was good not great.    Second course I had the CRISPY SKIN SCOTTISH SALMON - Petite Pois, Parisian Potatoes, Chanterelle, Lardons, Red Wine Reduction. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=6NnnhNAVFL83PlN4cXTCjw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a> The salmon was melt in your mouth tender.  Even though I was not a bit hungry, I had to finish this delicious piece of fish!    My fiance had Petit Cut Filet Mignon (8 oz) with Roasted Rosemary Potatoes, Fricassee of Baby Turnips, Onions & Carrots, Sauce Bordelaise.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=VwXEEeOnSomAksNdTVuBZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a>  It  was cooked to perfection and also very tender.    For dessert, we all got Creme Brulee.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=NAP9J7iL3IaBGF19hEi-9w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-...</a> Normally I don't care for creme brulee and I was really bumped that there was no other choice.  But one bite of it I was in heaven.  The top was crispy and the inside was so creamy.  Definitely one of the best Creme Brulee I've ever had.    I have no idea how much the meal would have cost us if we had to pay.  I was able to find the price for the salad at $19.  Filet Mignon at $53, and Salmon at $33.  I'd say the price is average for a restaurant like this in Vegas.    For now, I'm giving this place 5 stars.  Because the food was great, the service was great, and best of all - it was free!",

    "text": "Was attracted to their summer tasting menu. When I asked about it the waiter was not keen on it. Basically tried to discourage it. I went for it anyway. Started with steak tartar. Served with a quail egg, a few chips and smoked Black Sea salt. Also served with some buns and a tapenade. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Next course I had a nectarine salad. Way too much dressing. Salad was soggy. Almost dripping. Could not taste the greens at all. Fresh nectarine, a few nuts. I think Boursin cheese. But too much dressing.  Next course was Scottish salmon. The skin was nice and crispy!  Nice. Cooked a little over medium. A mushroom style sauce was good but just ok. Had a garnish on top. Not edible. Was not sorted through. Stalks were tough. (Virgin mojito was very good).  The pano cotta desert was good. But it was served with a big soup spoon. Some other waiter walked by and noticed and immediately brought me a dessert spoon. So many of the servers are poorly trained. Others seemed nervous. Main waiter besides trying to discourage ordering the taster was friendly. Well all of them were friendly. Just a little off.",

We went on a sunday night so it wasn't crowded and the food came out very quickly. The servers were very friendly and very attentive.",

    "text": "Here's the deal, I've been here probably 10 times over the last several years. The service and the food are hit or miss. Its not the people, it is a management problem. This becomes clearer after you get to know they staff, who are very friendly and, I think, are doing their best given the leadership.  Let's start with the negative, the principal issues are food quality and inconsistency. You can have a great steak one week and a marginal steak the next. It could be cooked the way you ordered one week and the next its like you got someone else's order. Too many people service one table, you never know who is in charge because the guy or gal who appears to be your waiter, is on again off again. I think this is because when they are slow, they spread servers too thin. I've had good and bad servers, last night I had Eldifon and he was above average.  On the positive side, they have an expansive wine list covering California, France and  Italy; the values are not there in terms of price, but they have selection. I was there on October 16 and the sommelier was great, he recommended a very good montrachet that was 3.5 times its retail, a little high for an '09.   Though terribly inconsistent in terms of what they may have from time to time (management not minding the cheese list), they have one of the best cheese lists in Vegas and in the West when its in order. Too boot, they have about 20 bottles on the 'by the glass list' that are good for pairings with the cheese. They could probably do a better job of helping people make decisions, but, again...  This is a diamond in rough shape. I would not do an important meal here, but if you are willing to go through some bumps its not a bad spot to try out. There are certainly worse!",

First off, we asked for bread as service was slow three times and each time we asked, we were told it was coming. Finally, after 30 minutes, we got bread. The biggest disappointment, however is when our main dishes arrived at the table. We were a party of four and all of us received our steaks cold. If that wasn't enough, two of our steaks were over cooked. After dinner, we got a few desserts to share for the table, one of which was baked Alaska. If you've ever had baked Alaska, it's not a difficult dessert to make. The baked Alaska was the worst I've ever had. The cake was frozen and they poured way too much 151 on it when the flambe'd it. Not the dinner experience you're expecting when you spend all that money.",

    "text": "We came here with a big party based on their previous experiences at this place. In the past they had said they received excellent service. This visit was not the case. The waiters were unfriendly and robotic. We were the only people out on the patio and it was the perfect night for it. This right off the bat told us something about this place. Since there are not many good restaurants that you can sit outside at and the fact that it was empty was not good. The wine selection was good and my husband and I ordered a Red Zin. It took about 30 minutes for our table to receive our drinks. We both were happy with our drink choice. The rest of the evening was spent ordering as much as we could ahead of time since our waiter would take forever to get our orders out to us. As far as the food goes, we ordered appetizers and were given no recommendations. We had 12 people at our table and an appetizer was enough for 2 people. It would have been helpful if they had suggested we order multiple for the table or just given any sort of direction. The appetizers were very bland.(tuna tartar, crab salad, shrimp scampi). My husband ordered the filet mignon and the order came out incorrectly. It was under cooked and they forgot the sauce that was supposed to be on top. Since everything took forever to come out he had to wait additional time to eat his food. The sides that came with the steak were underwhelming as well. They were also very small, about 5 pieces of asparagus for the whole table, again some direction would have been nice! The french fries were dry. I did like the mushrooms.  I ordered the Salmon which I typically would not at a steakhouse since it's risky. The Salmon was cooked perfectly but everything about the dish lacked flavor. I found the entire experience very disappointing.",

    "text": "Was in town recently for a work conference and took some major clients to Morel's for dinner. Most people ordered some form of steak, I had a 35 day aged NY Strip. The waitress suggested to me that the steak temp be medium \"in order to fully release the flavor\" -- since medium is how I usually order my steaks, I agreed.  The table's food soon arrived and I started eating my steak at the narrower end of the NY and it was fine. By the time I got about half way through my steak, it was essentially raw and not just in the middle but through about 80% of of the steak. Looked around and two of my clients who ordered steaks also had them extremely under cooked.  Called the waitress over and showed her my steak -- there was really no way to dispute the doneness. I'm not even sure it was safe to eat even if you like a med-rare steak it was well under done. The waitress agreed and offered to bring it up to temp.  Over the years I've learned to never send food back and ask for it to be fixed. Better to just walk away from a bad meal. I told the waitress not to bother and went back to talking with my clients and associates.   Eventually the manager approaches, apologizes and makes a token offer of a drink or a dessert to me for the trouble. I wasn't really that hungry and was with clients, so not wanting to make a scene, I simply said no thanks. The manager apologizes again and says he has spoken with the kitchen.  My company was picking up the bill, so I didn't press it, but what floors me in all of this is:   1. If you pay $64 for a steak it better be cooked correctly. If anybody had simply checked the temp of *any* of the steaks at our table, they would have realized the problem. It should have never even been sent out.  2. At no point did the manager offer to pick up the cost of the steak, offer us a free meal, anything. He simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away, thinking he had done all he could.  3. There was a big conference staying at the hotel, we were all in business attire, but the manager didn't seem to consider that we were with clients (or that maybe I *was* a customer of the host, since I didn't pick up the check). Or maybe he did realize and didn't offer the comp because we were going to expense the meal.  If it had been just me or my wife and I on a date, I would have probably pressed it a bit more. If it had been a $20 steak, I would have probably just written it off, but for $64 you expect perfection or near perfection.  Needless to say I will never bring a customer to Morel's again nor eat there myself.",

Robert (Tall asian gentlemen) the manager, came to the table and did not want to comp the whole meal. He asked if there was something he could do and I said to comp the whole meal but he said no.   He offered to comp us a drink or a dessert but I decline. We are not heavy drinkers and do not do a lot of sweets. I just asked for another server. Team co worker and team customer. Spoiled my whole meal and appetite. Oh and food was horrible. Ordered the farm raised chicken, seared scallops and potato leek soup(which was ok).  Only 3 parties at 11:30pm at night. Eventhough we came late, they should of still had their establishment together.  Robert needs to work on better customer solution with conflicts. He didn't know how to make things better. It appeared that he was on employees side (team employee) but he shouldn't make it that obvious. Customers come first  The staff do not have it together here. The ambiance looks great but some of the workers create an ugly atmosphere. Plenty of places to eat in Vegas besides this establishment.",

    "text": "5-star review for LUNCH ONLY! I'm not a huge fan of their dinner, to be honest (mostly because there are so many other better options in this fabulous city).  My family and I make it a point to dine here for one of our lunches every time we travel to Vegas, which is luckily 5 or so times a year. They have a seasonal menu, but they generally keep their best-sellers. They also have a splendid brunch menu, and with this they serve mini donuts/beignets of a sort, rolled in sugar; when warm, these are like starting the meal with dessert (uh, who said that's a bad thing?)  So, without further ado, I have three extremely crucial words for you: GET.THE.QUICHE. This is like no other quiche I have had in my life (and I've had my share). It's like they imported it right out of France, because this is to a T exactly how they make it in le Paris. It isn't thick to where the egg takes control over your taste buds...it's so airy and fluffy, but still has the slightest crisp on the outside layer-- you essentially won't have to chew this dish because it's so creamy and fluffy. Embedded throughout this piece of absolute heaven is applewood smoked bacon (the thick cut kind!), perfectly carmelized onions, and a cheese, possibly Gruyere? Deceivingly light, this is one rich piece quiche. It comes with choice of pommes frites or salad, and the fries are on par with some of the better thin fries I've ever had.   Now, for the other options (almost overshadowed by the masterpieceofquiche). The Croque Monsieur is also quite tasty and has just the right amount of ham-layering to cheese ratio. My dad frequently gets the omelets  and they are also worth ordering if you're looking for a more savory option. On normal days, they serve some bread (conjoined twin pieces) with a pesto-like dipping sauce (we also get butter with the Hawaiian sea salt sprinkled across the top as that's what they used to serve..you'll have to request it, probably).   For dessert, you cannot steer wrong from the sorbet/ice cream selections. With a wiiiide array of flavors, you can get three scoops served in a cross-cookie type of concoction alongside a dollop of whipped cream and strawberry slices. Try the vanilla almond ice cream and the coconut sorbet...Mmmm, palate-cleansing after a flawless meal.    Steve used to be their best waiter, but he no longer works there. Nevertheless, we've never had any issues with their lunchtime service. GOOO here!",

The wait between courses took so long the matre D bought us drinks, the dinner orders were finally brought out wrong and as I waited for my Rib Eye steak to be cooked while everyone else ate, it was capped off by a steak that was flavorless and tough. ( cooked med rare ) Lastly we were even given a bill that was wrong ( you guessed it, higher than should have been) double billed for an $80 bottle of wine. As I reprimanded myself for canceling STK to stay in The Venetian after a long day at work, I can only say I will never go there again and instead stay with my first choice for a great steak STK. Sorry Morel but you need a lot of work on service, food, and timing if you are going to call yourself a top quality restaurant in one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. Totally disappointed  I am an avid  steak lover and the experience I looked forward to all week was ruined.",

I have had lunch and dinner at this facility several times. We normally eat on the outside patio and try and time it so that we can watch the pirate show happening at the Treasure Island.  Whether it is lunch time or dinner time, I have always ordered the following items: 1. Dozen Oysters on the half shell 2. Some potatoes 3. Bone-in Steak (Sometimes during the lunch hour they did not offer it on the menu however they accommodated me) 4. Bottle of Merlot and in most cases the Duckhorn  The Oysters (West and East Coast) were always fresh with virtually no odor and tasted very very good. They turned this appetizer around very fast. The Steak is always cooked to perfection and is very flavorful. You put all this together with a bottle of Merlot and you got yourself a delightful evening.  The staff is always knowledgeable and very courteous. At times months would go by before I visit there again however they have always remembered me.",

    "text": "Terrible. Food and service.  I have been to just about every strip steak place and this is hands down my least favorite. And not just by a little bit, by a rather large margin.I love steak and I love French so this should have been a match made in heaven, perhaps how much I looked forward to going here tainted my view but it was so bad it can't all have been my bias. Just look at my review record- I have enver given 1 star to anything else- I am a pretty soft judge  First- my reception.  I had just spent an inordinate amount of time playing poker at the Venetian. As such I was not dressed super formally- khaki shorts, polo shirt, tennis shoes- more than acceptable for vegas lunch. This is on a Weds about 230pm. The host ( a dude) ignores me for about 5 minutes while he is on the phone than finally, reluctantly, brings me to a table. It is then about 20 minutes before I see my waiter. During this wait I am drinking some water and happen to empty my glass. The water guy comes up and starts pouring the water before the pitcher is over the glass and misses the glass for a solid 3 seconds soaking the entire table and myself before he notices. I ask to move to a dry table. He tells me \"maybe\". At this point I look around, I am one of 6 people in the entire place. Eventually I get moved.  My Order I try to get the exact same thing my first time at every steak house here for comparison- bone in ribeye, potato side, tartare. The waiter comes up to my table and I try and get my order in as quickly as possible since I have already been waiting.   me: \"Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois\" him: would you like to hear about our specials me: no him: well then what would you like me: Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois him: im not sure we have that me: which part him: uh... the potato  it only went downhill from there. He didn't write anything down, came back twice to ask to clarify, and then brought tuna tartare. The tuna was actually the highlight of the day.  The Steak I like steam rare to medium rare. That being said, I will eat just about anything. The steak that was brought to me was not even grey, it was so dark grey throughout I doubted if it was actual meat. It looked like an overcooked mcdonalds hamburger inside. I first cut a piece off the end and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt- maybe it wasn't like that in the middle. It was.   Now, a quick note about me. I don't really ever send food back. I'm a gambler and I think ordering food is sort of a gamble- in this case I gambled and lost. Also, if a kitchen has already screwed something up I don't have much faith in them fixing it so generally I just let it go.  And that is what I planned to do here. So my waiter comes back and says \"how is everything\". The following conversation ensues  me: The steak is way overcooked, its inedible, can I get my check him: It looks fine to me  Ok, thats annoying. Still, never argue with stupid people right...  me: just the check please him: I'll bring that right out  15 minutes later the waiter comes back with another waiter  New waiter- I'm sorry sir, we cannot send that back, it looks medium rare to me.   At this point I am flabbergasted. Was I getting punked? Could I actually be eating in a professional restaurant? Let alone a nice one in Las Vegas? Could anyone working in a steakhouse for longer than 3's of minutes think this was medium rare?  me: I'm not trying to send it back, I just want my check  Another 10ish minutes go by and I get my check. I choose to pay by way of the credit card. I put it in the little wallet thing and stand it up so all can see the card sticking out of it. At this point I look at my watch and think to myself \"how long could this take\". Turns out quite a while. After another 10 minutes I look around and I can't see any other customers in the place. I take my check and walk to the front where the host and 3-4 waiters are sitting in the bar area. I ask my waiter to run my card which he sighs and then does. Also, they charged me for the tenderloin tartare which is 1 dollar more than the Tuna....  I then walked outside across the street and ate at stripburger.  In closing, Carne Vino greater than Morels",

The surrounding art was erotic and interesting.   The food was absolutely delicious. We started out with the tuna tartar, which was fresh and very tasty. The onion soup was just ok. It had a little sour taste to it which is something that I am not used to, but that is just a personal preference. I had the 18 hour braised ribs, my husband had the 28 day filet mignon medium well, and a friend had the sea bass. All was very very good. The steak was one of the best I have ever tried. The ribs were delicate and simply melted in my mouth. The sea bass was also very delicate and cooked just right. The drinks were delicious and they did not skimp on the alcohol.   Overall, expect to pay a lot for dinner. We paid $300 without tip for a three coarse meal for 4 people. The steaks does not come with a side so you will have to order one if you want more than meat. My ribs however, did come with a side of puree potatoes. If you are into great tasting meat and have some money to spend, then give this place a try.",

Dinner started off with an amuse bouche of rib meat with red pepper cream on a crostini.  It was a good bite.  For an entree, I had the filet mignon with bernaise sauce.  The filet was super tender and the bernaise sauce was incredible.  My only complaint is that the filet was cooked weird - it went from medium well on one end to medium rare on the other end. (I ordered it medium).    For a side, I had the truffle mac and cheese.  Hands down the best truffle mac and cheese I've ever had.  It was incredible.  I will absolutely be eating here again.",

We scoured opentable and voila, Morels it was.  We ordered the caesar salad which was made table side.  It is a caesar salad, nothing special although I thought it had too much acidity and I wouldn't have minded some anchovies.  Before the salad came I was famished but the bread was nowhere to be seen.  I'm not sure why we had to ask them to bring the bread but we did however it was warm and soft and the butter and olive tapenade that came with it were a perfect combination.  I did order a steak, a bone in rib eye but I had so much bread I couldn't finish it all.  The steak though wasn't all that great.  It was well cooked; I asked for medium rare and I got medium rare but the seasoning that was on it wasn't flavorful enough and the flavor it did have wasn't all that good.  We also ordered the pomme frites which are thin cut fries and those I do not like even though the truffle mayo it came with was delicious and a good sauce for the steak.    Service was good and attentive.  I would probably want to try other steak houses next time I'm here.",

The so-called prime dry aged ribeye was supposed to be medium rare towards rare; it was inconsistently cooked. 1200o ovens don't ensure good prep. The meat was dry and tasteless. I do not believe the cut weighed what they claimed or that it was dry aged or prime. I've had better choice dry aged. No marbling and a poorly trimmed piece. Way too much rub was trying to cover up a bad cut.   The seafood was mediocre. Only the oysters were okay.  The martini, when I finally got it, was very good, but took way too long and way too much ice floating in it.   With so many great choices for steak in Las Vegas (including the venerable Emeril's right down the corridor) skip this place every single time.",

    "text": "This was our second visit to this French Steakhouse and our latest visit left us wondering if the Normandy invasion was worth it (lol).  Our first inkling of where this meal was heading was when no one showed up to acknowledge our woeful existence for at least ten minutes.  What's worse is when the waiter aka Waiter A, showed up he never introduced himself or had an modicum of customer service. It was almost like he really wanted to be somewhere else, I know I did at this juncture.  I ordered their $17 Bloody Mary which was served with ZERO ACCOUTERMENTS! No celery, olives, shrimp, etc. REALLY? I asked Waiter A about the paucity of the drink and he asked- what did you want in it! NEVER-MIND!  Note, still no water.  \"Waiter A\" was also no help whatsoever in navigating the menu. My spouse was unable to get an understanding of how the meal was prepared. Example- Wife - how is the Oregano Chicken prepared? Waiter A - It's Chicken flavored with Oregano. Wife - Thanks.  It's a shame the service was so bad as the food was passable.  However, good service makes for a good restaurant, Great Service gives rise to a great restaurant and Bad service- you can figure that out!  Unlike General McArthur, We Shall Not Return!",

We were sat in a private dining area and we had one waitress to help a dept of 19.  I ordered the French onion soup, flat iron prime steak, and trio of creme brulee for dessert.  The onion soup was huge and I nearly finished it.  Then when my medium rare steak came out medium, I sent it back.  Granted, 7 of us ordered this, ranging from rare to medium, and we all got our steak under/over.  2 of us sent it back and the second time was the charm.  The frites were similar to In and Out...yum.  The trio of creme brulee was delicious.  I liked the pistachio the most.  The vanilla was good and the caramel was a bit on the sweet side.    Overall, it was ok.",

She said, sure but we only have bar seating today. The lounge area was filled with tables and some kind of a business meeting going on. The comfortable sofas were all missing. Not a big deal since I wanted to sit at the bar, but I noticed the uncomfortable vibe in the room.   I pretty much hated the bartender from the beginning. She was not welcoming and clearly missed her dose of Abilify that morning. She was cold and made me feel like I was annoying her. I ordered a glass of champagne and asked for the menu. She brought me the dinner menu. I then had to ask for the cheese menu. Then I had to ask for the lunch menu! I asked why the hesitation on brining me the lunch menu? She tells me that I would have to get my order in for a lunch menu item within the next ten minutes.   Maybe she was trying to get me to order from the dinner menu because she knew how much I would hate the burger I ordered!  This was one of the worst burgers I have ever had. Flavorless! I mean try adding salt and pepper at least! This was a classic burger, nothing fancy and they managed to screw it up.   In the future I will stick with champagne and cheese at Morels. They are both excellent here...I had a second glass of bubbly to be sure!",

    "text": "Went to Morels French Steakhouse last night expecting memorable time. Everything we ate was not up to be served at place that claims to be related to French cuisine. Lets start with such simple thing as bread. When you think French bakery you start salivating while seeing in your head that crunchy or chewy crusts, amazing aroma of freshly baked bread. Now, stop dreaming, you will get two tiny poorly leavened lumpy dinner rolls which are served with two spreads - one is butter and another - mix of black olives with anchovies which was just bluh: why would you mix two salty ingredients to make it more salty. To start our dinner we ordered sea scallop appetizer and onion soup. Scallops came on bed of couscous which was overly drenched in butter and scallops were on chewy side due to being slightly overcooked. My husband stated that my homemade French onion soup that I cooked using recipe online was way much better than the one he was eating. It lacked flavors, was more on sweet side and bread they used for top tasted stale. At least they did not use mozzarella cheese to cover toast that most cheaper places use, that was a plus. The main course was choice of 14oz Prime Cut Ribeye for $66 and my husband had 20oz bone in New York Sirloin for $60 which, per him, was tough to chew. The sides we got were Potato Dauphinois (Au Gratin) and Brussels sprouts. My steak, per my husband, had more flavor than his with bone and bone usually gives more flavor to the cut. For the price it was not the best meat especially considering that they claim that they age it. Potatoes were okay, nothing really outstanding, tasted somewhat like they were prepared many hours ago and reheated with some cheese on the top. The biggest disappointment was with Brussels sprouts - they were absolutely raw with burned edges, not caramelized as expected. Overall, the dinner that came close to $200 with a tip was failed expectations experience.",

At least there's value at an applebees. I must say the steak I had there was in the top 5 of all time. The True flavor was that of steak humans use to get in the 80's. They do give you an assortment of salts to flavor your steak. Some places over salt to enhance the bland flavor of their meat. I am very Leary of eating seafood in vegas and never in summertime when minimum wage workers leave products on loading docks, but their oysters were as fresh tasing as I've had in seafood resorts. This place is great. Oh be sure to get the dauphin potatoes so good",

We didn't really need to look far at other high end restaurants as Morel's and another steak house was in the hotel. Morel's didn't have high reviews but I based my decision on the posted Yelp pictures.   I made a reservation through Open Table but didn't really need make a reservation for Saturday night dinner on the long Memorial Day weekend (it wasn't that packed).   Experience and atmosphere was nice. Patio seating is available that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd and Treasure Island/Wynn/the mall (corner view). The service was awesome and the food was delicious. We had steaks, pasta and the raw oysters. A plus was that Morel's had a children's menu!! SCORE! You seldom have children's menus at high end places, this helped out as I had my young son with me. Raw oysters ($20 for 1/2 dozen) was super fresh and tasty. My \"prime\" rib eye Bordelaise was good ($66) but a bit over cooked, I asked for medium rare and it was almost medium. Mom's linguini clams was good, the pasta sauce was perfect for dipping the bread and Morel's added tons of clam.   Overall a good dinner with my parents, we all enjoyed Morel's and I would recommend it to others.",

Although the steak could've had a bit more seasoning this time, the service is always exquisite enough to come back for.  The Serbian waitress we had was attentive despite having a table of 20 plus to service as well. The table had asked for more umbrellas for shade and she moved 6 all by herself. It speaks to the level of dedication she has for her tables since not one of her coworkers came by to assist much to our dismay.  She kept the drinks coming and had our water cups always filled.

Tried to liven it up with bernaise, but that too was subpar. Only ate half the steak. Server never even bothered to ask if it was okay. Same with the French onion soup which I had been craving since I saw it on the menu online. Lousy with no flavor, in a French restaurant no less?! My friend had the rib eye which he liked ok, but just tasted excessively salty to me. That was $64. The Brussels sprouts with balsamic reduction was a fraction of the quality I've gotten at much less expensive restaurants. Just had no taste. The server was nice enough but overly aggressive (tried to sell my 9 year old a $120 lobster - thank god I asked the price before we finalized the order). Overall, a bad experience, and I'll never go back. Shame that we wasted what could have been a wonderful meal at any number of fine restaurants in this hotel on Morel's.",

From the moment Brandon introduced himself the feeling of being in a restaurant vanished as it suddenly felt like I was sitting at an old friend's dining room table. Along with his friendly conversation and knowledge of the Vegas Strip, Brandon broke down the menu and explained everything ever so perfectly, from the steak and sides, to the sauces and salts. If you're visiting Sin City and looking for a delicious piece of meat that'll visit you in your dreams, look no further than Morels at the Venetian.",

Before we left we asked for a mimosa to go (which he suggested before we ordered) and he said no. I find it ridiculous that he ignored a party of 8 in that way.

I have dined here twice; once for brunch and once for dinner. In the morning the restaurant is so nice and bright. You can't tell from the entrance of the restaurant, but they have huge windows inside that brings in so much light into the restaurant.  Which is a nice change from being inside casinos all day!  They also have patio seating as well that looks out to Las Vegas blvd and treasure island. Service was great(one of the reasons I gave them three starts, not one).    The bad. FOOD. So for brunch, my particular dish was half good half bad. The potatoes that were on the side were the worst.  It basically felt like they were premade earlier that day and sat around and once ordered, they were scooped and came delivered out to my dish.  They did not seem fresh at all. They were not hot.  They were cold and stale. The rest of my dish however was delicious. Now for dinner, I had the exact experience. My food just didn't seem hot or fresh. I had this crab appetizer that came with bread. And boy that bread looked toasted with butter. But once you took a bite into it... you regretted it instantly. It was so stale and not even warm!  That's when I came to the conclusion that they pre made some items on the menu and it just sits around.   I would skip this place and just trek over to Bouchon in the Venezia tower. Sad to say since they have a great location. Right in the entrance of the palazzo. Not far from taxi and Las Vegas blvd.",

Delicatessen, good quality cheese, cold cuts, olives, bread, pickles and many other really tasty small bites.   From 12 pm to 1 pm on weekends they have happy hour buy one get two, this special only applies to some of their cocktails and beers, not for top-shelf drinks.

Banana fresh toast: You will like this if you like bananas.  The best part- FRESHLY HANDMADE BLOODY MARY CART! $12 each. I love it. They have a good view on the patio as well.

Both were very good, but I preferred the Mushroom Crepe.   I do not ask for much in a Crepe. All I need it to be is light, airy, thin, crispy around the edges and have a even light Maillard reaction across both surfaces. The Chefs at Morels met all those Crepe requirements on both dishes. I am a big fan of Gruyere so you cannot trust my opinion on their choice of Cheese as it is most likely biased. The Gruyere in their Crepe was of excellent quality. It had lots of nuttiness and fruitiness. You just know that wheel has Switzerland stamped all over it. The Mushrooms were properly sauteed and seasoned. I had read reviews where people say that their food had no flavor. I am a big proponent of letting the staff know your if food is bland. Thankfully, I did not have this issue on this trip to Morels.   The Toast was a couple of pieces of Brioche, some Jam and Butter. It was a good breakfast accompaniment but nothing I didn't have at home.   I see quite a mixed bag of reviews for Morels. I have eaten here more than a few times and  have always had a good experience with the food. I will continue to eat here as long as that stays True.",

My wife ordered the quiche, I ordered the American Breakfast, and my mother-in-law ordered the Seafood Alfredo. My wife's quiche was a small pie slice shape with a lot of pieces of long onion strips. The quiche was runny and didn't have much flavor other than the onions. My american breakfast had 3 eggs with one slice of bread. For 3 over easy eggs, I was left wanting more bread. The sausage didn't seem fresh, and the potatoes were bland. My mother-in-laws Seafood Alfredo didn't have any alfredo sauce, and everything tasted like the salmon that was in the meal. The fruit plate that we order was the best part of the meal. Pineapple, Cantaloupe, Strawberries and Honey Dew were the main items, with some blueberries, honey and yogurt to fill in the plate.  In short, we wouldn't go back. There are plenty of other places that are better at breakfast for a much better price. The place was almost empty and now we know why.",

You press the plunger slowly, not like you are detonating explosives. Picking coffee grounds out of my teeth is not my favorite thing to do while eating breakfast. Wife had the bacon and cheese crepe, it was very tasty and filled her up. I had the American breakfast consisting of over-easy eggs, bacon, and potatoes with pepper and mushrooms. Bacon was very good and not soggy, potatoes were also serviceable but lacked any flavor. The egg whites were so underdone it looked like someone poured a few tablespoons of water on them. Yuk. When we left cash for the bill, the waitress asked if we wanted change. Every time a waiter does this, I mark the review down 1 star.",

I am not an organic nut but I swear this was the finest tasting steak on the planet. A dollop of butter ala Ruth Chris on the top was the perfect complement. Three kinds of salt came with the steak and the brussel sprouts were sublime.   Small, briny oysters began the meal and were delectable but the steak was so superior I skipped right through to the entree. Our server was terrific and the chairs were ultra comfortable. Many superlatives here but deservingly so. Make Morels one of your stops when you visit Sin City because this food is positively decadent.",

Followed by A chilled shrimp...literally one shrimp (altho a larger shrimp). The cocktail sauce was so bland. I had the watermelon arugula salad. The watermelon was flavorful but the salad and dressing were extremely bland and needed a lot of salt. The sirloin was just okay, nothing to write home about. The halibut was okay too but I question the freshness of the fish because it left a weird tingle in my tongue which I've heard happens when fish is not fresh.   The WORST part of the dining experience was that I ordered the cheeseburgers for my son off of the kids menu. The meat came out borderline raw. My son actually ate some of it and only have s few bites I noticed how undercooked the meat was. I should have take a photo as proof. I was so angry and so flabbergasted that they would serve such underdone meat to a child. I showed the waiter and by his reaction he was shocked as well. I sent the food back and they brought out more well cooked burgers.  The service was this place is awful. It's so slow. I was there on a Saturday night and it wasn't event that full and yet the service was extremely slow. We sat on the patio and I felt like we were being ignored because I barely saw our waiter.",

    "text": "Morels: Where mediocre food meets horrible service!  My girl friend and I ate here last night and had an awful experience. It was her birthday, something we had mentioned on our open table reservation, it would have been nice for them to say happy birthday or attempt to make it a pleasant experience for us.  When we were seated, no one came by to give us menus or water for 10 minutes, despite 3 staff seeing our table. When jerry finally came to our table he was very polite but, unfortunately, he was also very inadequate.  The meal consisted of being ignored, getting up from the table to grab a carafe of water to refill our own glasses, empty plates being left on the table (making it difficult to eat our meal due to lack of table space), never offering refills or quality checking in a timely fashion. The manager came over to ask if we needed anything but we had already refilled our own water, he wasn't very helpful.  My friends chicken entree was so bad she had 2 bites and pushed it away but no one asked if it was ok or why she didn't eat it and so we ended up paying for something we didn't eat. My salad was not bad, it was mediocre.  We were visibly annoyed and were not asked how our meal was.  I can't even believe the poor quality of service. I will NEVER eat here ever again and I would recommend that people stay away unless shitty food and service are your thing.  This restaurant is a disgrace and should be ashamed of their staff and embarrassed of their food.",

Things seemed to start alright and the water and wine we ordered were poured often, but then it went downhill. I expect higher prices in Vegas, but $26 for crabmeat cocktail and it's barely enough for one person is a little ridiculous. The shrimp and tuna were no different. Good for one, but sharing is optional. The meal? Pretty much everyone ordered steak, as you do at a steakhouse.For me, I ordered a bone-in ribeye. After I ordered, found out they didn't have it. Ordered the prime ribeye.  Then we waited. For literally an hour. I think they forgot to put it in and then realized their failure. Why? Out of 10 steaks ordered, 3 were done properly. I ordered medium rare and it was purple on the inside. One ordered well and it was bright pink. Medium well came out medium rare if they were lucky; it was bordering rare. I think they forgot, slapped them on the grill quick, plated and sent them. For a $65 steak, it should be perfect. And the sides? Small, one person sides and overdone. The brussel sprouts were basically black. We had a better meal the night before at the burger place near the food court. Avoid this place.",

I've cooked better steaks at home using high heat methods on my Big Green Egg or pan frying and finishing with a butter garlic glaze.  I was very disappointed with the steak. Nuff said on that..  We had a Crab Appetizer, Caesar Salad, of course the house rolls, and Steak.  I had the bone-in Strip blackened medium rare with heavy spice and a $25 glass of 2009 Cabernet S.  My colleague had the fillet -medium.    The best part of the experience was our waiter a native of Acapulco named Tino (I believe).  He was friendly, funny and thoughtful.  I'd give him 5 Stars.  The final bill came out to $280 and had me wishing we'd visited Hash House a GoGo instead.  If your looking for steak in The Venetian/Palazzo run don't walk to \"The Cut\" instead.",

Undercooked asparagus, mediocre scalloped potatoes, average mushrooms, average corn. Steak was not tasty and was burnt on parts.  None of the food was hot.  It was all lukewarm. The hot rolls were tasty. The \"fresh roasted Ethiopian\" coffee was poorly roasted and the French press was not given 4 minutes before pressing the strainer.  Someone needs to teach these people how to do coffee properly. Very disappointing restaurant.  Do not waste your time or money.

Began with a selection of cheeses--a nice and varied list from which to choose--and enjoyed every bite.  We both had fish--salmon for me, halibut for her. No complaints.  Halibut was especially good.  Salmon was a bit on the plain side.  Based on the description I expected that up to a point and was in the mood for a plain bit of fish, but it should have been a bit richer in taste since lentils and bordelaise sauce was a part of the dish.  Bread and butter were perfect, by the way.  We split a dessert and had the cream brulee with chocolate mouse--it's a house speciality.  Very nice, light and tasty.  Throughout our meal the service was superb, always on top of things but never intrusive.",

Our server was Brandon . My husband had a coupon from which our hotel gave us . Buy one drink get the next one free. Gave it to our waiter, said he'd never seen that before . Ok so we still ordered our drinks . My husband a Pinot noir and me Prosecco. Ordered the rigatoni and my husband the ribeye . Also ordered a dozen oysters and cheese platter . All in all food was delicious, don't get me wrong . When our bill came ,our server said he couldn't take the coupon and to talk to our hotel or the Grazie desk . Ok , no big deal . When my husband was signing the bill , for the tip he asked how much do we give . I have a tip calculator app . Our total amount came to $ 190.83. So the app said $28.50 for a tip . Instead we gave $25.00. As he walked away with the bill in hand , he opened it and rolled his eyes . I'm like really . Are you serious . Why $25 and not $28 for the tip ? Well first like I said the food was delicious but $40 for oysters etc . The night before , we ate at Table 10 , Emerils restaurant and it was waaaay better than here . Price , quality and service. I understand this is a French restaurant but way overpriced. I mean $ 25 is $25 . I don't know what he was expecting. Lesson learned here . Won't be returning here . Table 10 , I highly recommend. I think we could've gave a $30 tip and he still would've rolled his eyes . Ppl shouldn't be greedy and thankful for whatever they get . Also for this being a French upscale restaurant, the music they played was Elton John Benny and the Jets , Journey etc . Come on . Oysters $40 side of asparagus $14 but we need to listen to this kind of music in a fancy restaurant. Looks like we were the ones who should've been rolling our eyes . Save your $$$ and go to Table 10 instead . No greedy waiters there.",

Since the trip was on the company dime, I had little hope that I would find something healthy and tasty enough to fall within Per Diem rates. Morels did not disappoint.  My colleagues and I dropped in for a late breakfast/early lunch armed with a 20% off coupon from The Palazzo, and were delighted to discover that the menu offered enough variety to satisfy everyone in our party. Since I was craving breakfast, I was able to order a free range mushroom and herb omelet, along with several tasty rounds of rich, roasted coffee served in a personal French Press.  The accompanying Pommes Frites were unexpected and appreciated, but a little too salty and heavy.  Wait staff were very friendly and attentive, and more than tolerant of our \"frumpy slugs from Ohio\" attire. The restaurant seemed shockingly empty for a Friday around noon; however, I appreciated the opportunity to relax in a beautiful and quiet space -- an escape from the bleeps, blips, and incessant smoke that lurks in the casinos just outside.",

EXCELLENT!  Tonight my wife had linguini clam... EXCELLENT!  Our 6 year old Stanley shared with us off of our plates and from the sides.  We ordered sides which were all popping with flavor...EXCELLENT!  Sides of the 2 days were sauteed seasonal mushrooms, steamed asparagus, sauteed green beans in butter, onion rings, and my favorite sauteed broccolini...  To be honest with you I really enjoyed how our sever Esteve Sabbah made the Caesar salad dressing in front of us at the table.  The dressing was made from scratch with several ingredients that we had direct input of quantity during the salad dressing making.   This was just EXCELLENT!...   I will not even try to attempt to explain the robust tastes coming from after meal desserts.  The desserts that we had were just amazing in taste and presentation...EXCELLENT!  I am in a full food coma.  I travel all around and get to eat out several places per year around the United States and I will say without hesitation that this French Steakhouse & Bistro made number one position for my own 2014 dining experiences, hands down.  Much thanks again for their professionalism, personal touch with entertaining my son Stanley, and all around dining experience to my server Esteve Sabbah and assistant Michael Lucas.  We will return again.  Do yourself a favor and request this team they are on top of it!  Happy Holidays guys see you again, The Cook Family.",

The place was relatively empty at 8:30 p.m.  We both ordered the $45 prix fixe summer dinner menu.  The service was attentive although there was a very long lag time between the first course's cheese and charcuterie and our second course.  Being foodies, my wife and I shared everything except the mussels I ordered for my second course.  The mussels tasted off to me.  I didn't think much of it until I came down with a three-day bout of diarrhea starting the next day around 12 noon.  I'm finally back at work now.",

Eggs were nice and soft, potatoes were delicious and the ham was perfection. The most amazing thing though? I never had to put salt or anything on my plate! everything was perfectly seasoned! Oh, and we sat outside. It was hot, but it's nice to have the option of either sitting inside or out. The view outside was a strip view, however the construction across the street can be somewhat of an eyesore. All in all, If you have money to splurge, I definitely would recommend Morels.",

After about 10 minutes, a waiter came and took our drink orders. About 20 minutes later, our drinks came. About 30 minutes after that, we GRABBED our waiter and asked him if he was planning to take our order. Finally, he did.   We placed a relatively straightforward appetizer + entree each order. About 15 minutes later, 3 out of 12 people received Caesar Salads that they ordered, but nothing else. Not until we called for the manager, and then waited another 10 minutes, did the remainder of the appetizer orders come. We're talking salads and soups here, nothing too difficult that would warrant so long and such a disconnect from the first salads. The manager was NOT apologetic and was incredibly rushed. He wouldn't really give us the time of day.  The entrees came some time later and were decidedly mediocre. The $120 lobster lacked flavor. The short ribs were dry. The salmon was bland.   There are DOZENS of better restaurants than Morels in Las Vegas. Why would anyone ever choose to eat here? We made the mistake. I recommend that you don't.",

We turned up in good time for our reservation and were shown to a remote corner of the restaurant with no view, even of the rest of the restaurant. We requested a move which was facilitated but I felt our waiter was unimpressed by our cheek. I was reminded of Steve Martin in LA Story 'Usual table, sir?' 'No, I'd like a good one, please'. However, after this shaky start, things improved greatly. The steaks were magnificent, done exactly to order and accompanied by a very acceptable Pinot Noir preceded by the obligatory Cosmopolitans. The bill, however, for three without dessert, was an eye-watering $350. Special occasions only unless you win big at the tables. Which we hadn't. Should be five stars but only gets four because of the indifferent service and relatively poor value for money.",

We were all very hungover and we're dying for a good cure in brunch but unfortunately, we left with something to be desired.  We all got different things and everyone had complaints about their food.  A couple people received the wrong orders and everyone's food was less than \"yum\".  People who ordered medium rare burgers got well done on stale looking broiche.  The \"most popular brunch item\"- the crab omelette, was dry and tasteless.  My turkey club sandwich required a bunch of salt, pepper, and ketchup because it was completely void of all flavor.  Also, it was supposed to come with avocado which was missing when I got it- when I pointed it out to the waitress, she left and while I thought she was getting me a new sandwich, she was actually just getting me half an avocado instead.  Glad I paid $15 for a bland sandwich with ingredients on the side so I could make it myself.  But not gonna lie- I squeezed my iced tea lemon on the avocado and added some salt to it and that ended up being the tastiest part of my whole meal.  And the fries were good too but I'm not sure how you could really go wrong with fries anyway.    Then there was the service.  We were stuck paying an 18% gratuity due to the size of our group but that's certainly not the type of service we received.  Considering this is a fairly nice restaurant and food wasn't cheap, I thought service would be better.  The waitress was clearly over us and annoyed. Our tab was off by $80 and it was taking awhile for us to figure it out and that irked her too.  Yes we were there for a couple hours but the restaurant was almost empty so what did it matter?  Wish we'd gone to the place in the Paris instead!",

I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer and was then told they were sorry but that was not available.  Isn't that the kind of information you're given upon being presented the menu?  Am I supposed to guess what they really have?  Disappointed, I move on and order a glass of Pinot Grigio and a pasta entree.  The waiter and trainee leave and I get a text from my friends that they will join me.  I can't get my waiter's attention because he's chatting with his friends on the other side of the room, so I get up and approach him.  When I ask if he can please ask the kitchen to delay my order until my friends have a chance to order he says \"no, I ordered that 5 minutes ago.\"  Am I at McDonalds?  In better restaurants the answer is never \"no\".  The correct answer is yes, and it's a cheerful yes.  Frankly, I was dumfounded and just stood in front of him until he offered to check with the kitchen.  I returned to my seat and watched him continue his friendly conversation without ever going to the kitchen.  When my food arrived I asked if it could be returned to the kitchen and held until the food for the rest of my party was delivered and this new server kindly obliged.  When the food for the entire table arrived my entree was still hot (thanks to the kitchen), and I assume my wine was still cold, since it had yet to be delivered.  We were all sitting and laughing into our napkins.  The place was practically empty and the guy couldn't remember a glass of wine.  Waiving my hand in the air did serve to gain the attention of what appeared to be a manager who got the wheels of progress in motion and when wonderwaiter finally came with my wine he tried putting on a good face by asking if we'd like more bread for the table.  I believe you can only use the word \"more\" in instances where there had already been \"some\" delivered.  One of my fellow diners started laughing so hard I thought he might choke on his bland and altogether unremarkable salad niciose.  I had no intention of choking on my altogether unremarkable fruit de mer linguine.  The dessert list looked enticing but my profiteroles were gummy.  Oh, the wine was very nice, once it arrived.",

    "text": "A nice airy room with a steakhouse feel without the heavy clubiness of many versions of the carnivores palace.  Lunch. Unplanned. Desperate for food before noon and wanting something other than Italian or new American. Default to Morel's since we were staying at the Palazzo.  A steakhouse, a French steakhouse. No expectations and not wanting steak.   Could be a disastrous choice. But French star chef cannot be too bad a choice.  Bouchon made us beleivers in French with American sensibilities. Not seeking an experience, just lunch.    She had the Slow Roasted Turkey Club and I was torn between 2 choices: Seafood Fettucini(me not wanting Italian but a sucker for anything seafood) or the Pork and Veal Meatloof. Our waiter said the Meatloaf for sure.  Done.   A paired glass of red, chosen by our server again.   A sandwich is a sandwich. But this one was memorable in its taste, freshness and the play of ingredients. The bread, Campagne , sliced thin was just the right handle and carb. Meatloaf is meatloaf.  Ground meat. Simple.  Well Morel's creation was a revelation. Texture, taste, finess of flavours accompanied by silky Youkon Gold Potato Puree aka mashers.   Wow.  If you do ketchup with meatloaf this one doesnot need any condiments to make it sing.  How the simple, unassuming plates are done speaks volumes of the chef's ability. Nothing overdone. Just ordinary crafted into extraordinary.  Trusting our server  who could have suggested the higher priced Fettucini and any possible higher priced glass of wine, gives me confidence in a 2nd visit.  Unplanned, no expectations often rewards with a new discovery that must be renewed on another visit.",

The food was just okay and some of it, the leafy salads, just didn't seem all that fresh.  Just a bummer all around.",
