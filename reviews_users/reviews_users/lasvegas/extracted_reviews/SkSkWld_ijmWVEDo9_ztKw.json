The guy working was really cool.  While he was making the pizza, he invited me to help myself to a drink (on the house).  Great customer service.  It was weird going to a place where the person working was friendly and nice.  p.s.  The pizza was yummy and tasted great warmed up the next day.",

    "text": "This place has some of the best pizza you'll find in town, but for half the price of any competitor. When my wife and I moved to Henderson last August, we had nothing but the clothes on our back the first night, so we tried the first local pizza place we came across. We also had it our second night. It quickly became our favorite in town. Whenever we have guests, we always eat in or order a pizza or two to show off our favorite place.  Tyler, the owner and pizzaiolo, really knows how to make delicious food. The crust is perfectly thin where it needs to be, chewy enough where it should be, and tastes great. The sauce is nice and sweet, and hardy enough to stand up to spicy toppings. We always get our pizza with black olives and basil (FRESH basil, mind you - to die for), and a medium-size is typically enough for dinner for the two of us. If we are treating a friend or two, we'll get a large, sometimes with an order of the decadent garlic knots. The garlic knots are probably the best I've had anywhere - always perfectly cooked and scrumptious, if a little messy. But totally worth it.   And to top all this off, it's extremely reasonably priced for the quality. Plus, I think every receipt is a coupon for half off your next pizza within 5 days. Also Tyler has a good memory for return customers, and clearly appreciates the business. Bottom line is, anyone living in or passing through Henderson has to give this place a try, or regret it.",

I only had the pepperoni pizza but the flavor was very good. It would say this place should get 4.5 stars because I cannot rate any place 5 stars after some of the deep dish pizzas I have eaten in Chitown. But, finally a place that sells yummy pizza, too bad they are far from my house because I would frequent them often!",

It's so cool that he cares enough about the reviews and took the time to respond back to me. So we went and I got the pleasure of meeting this awesome guy! Tyler is so welcoming, down-to-earth and just a really nice guy! He immediately got started on my garlic knots and they were the best damn garlic knots I've ever had!! They literally melt in your mouth!! Those knots had me dancing in my seat to the cool music that was playing. If you're in the neighborhood or even if you're NOT in the neighborhood, you MUST indulge at Bistro Pizza! Make it a requirement. You owe it to yourself to try this place out. From the moment you walk in, the staff makes you feel welcome and that's hard to come by these days. The pizza is awesome, the garlic knots are awesome, the staff is awesome and the owner Tyler is awesome. We'll definitely be back to work our way down the menu and try some other items! Thanks again Tyler!",

These people can make a great pie.  Not the cheapest, but when you're eating it, you don't remember the price.

Too bad pizzas taste better with more than one topping :)  I only wish there was a menu with pizzas with the toppings already chosen for you. I can never make up my mind on what toppings I want!   Service is if-y. We ordered pizza to go and sat in a seat directly in front of the cashier to wait. After 15+ minutes we asked how much longer it would be- turns out the pizzas were already done and they failed to call us up. Don't let that happen to you!  Yelp check in gets you free garlic knots with the order of a large pizza. You can't get the garlic knots if you use the Touro deal!",

    "text": "Thanks to my fellow yelpers for checking in here!  I would have never known this little gem was so close to me!   We stopped in for a carb filled lunch and I'm so glad we did!    Since it was our first visit, we had to look over the menu to make our decision.  It didn't take us long to start off with the garlic knots.  What goes good with garlic knots? Stromboli and Meatball sliders of course!  I don't know how much bread one can eat but we were going to see.    Oh my YUM!  Garlic knots were fabulous with just the right amount of garlic and cheese.  As if we weren't already in heaven, the 'Thaddius' stromboli was staring at us.  It was filled with pepperoni, salami, ham and sausage.   The italian meats were absolutely flavorful, delicious and filling.   To put the cherry on top, their meatball sliders gave the competition a run for their money!  The meatball baked on their homemade garlic knot topped with mozzarella and sauce made this girl's stomach happy.    We loved everything about this bistro!  The service was great and the food was even better!   I'll be back for sure!",

Maybe even all of Vegas. The pizza looks good, maybe a little unassuming, but once I bite into a slice I start getting memories of all the delicious pizza's I've eaten throughout my life. That good. I have say it's definitely the dough and the way they keep it simple. I also love their chicken wings tossed in sweet chili. I live walking distance and I'm so happy to have them so close.",

Since they were mesmerized, I just had a seat. Next thing I know, my kids both had a plate with dough and two cups of sauce and cheese!!!! They were SOOO excited! The nice guy behind the counter (we now call him celebrity chef) put them in the oven and everything! These guys went above and beyond on a FRIDAY afternoon. This place ROCKS!!!!!!",

The result was a hot and fresh, delicious pizza accompanied by chicken parmesan with noodles that weren't overly cooked.  The pizza came out soft and fluffy with a bit of chewiness. Instead of overloading it with toppings we chose to keep it simple with a half cheese half mushroom (Absolutely delicious mushrooms btw), which allowed the sauce to shine through (It's a very good sauce and it was too bad we could barely taste it the first time).  The garlic knots were cooked very well this time without too much butter.    Overall we enjoyed the meal very much and would definitely come back again.  Thanks again, Tyler.  It's probably recommended to not order delivery and invest the effort to go get it yourself.",

The person working the register was helpful, playful, polite, and made our first time at the restaurant a great experience. I will definitely stop there whenever I pass through the Vegas/Henderson area again!   The pizza is thin crust, but I wouldn't expect it to be ultra-thin. The wings were crispy and not slimy like other places, and they tasted excellent! The cheese bread was very tasty and the marinara that came with it was just as great. You have to try the ghost pepper fries too! They are sweet at first, and go well with ranch to cool down the heat from the ghost pepper seasoning on the fries.   Overall, I will come back to Bistro Pizza and I will instantly recommend it to anybody looking for food in the area.",

After browsing the menu I decided to order the baked penne, a stromboli, pep pizza and garlic knots. The quoted wait time for my order was accurate (I left to go pick up my daughter from school down the street). I asked for ranch with the salad that came with the penne. Once the order was ready I asked again if the ranch was in the container with the salad and I was told it was. I did not check the order but was disappointed when I got home to find that the stromboli was missing and there was no ranch for my salad and it was tossed in a balsamic dressing :( So, i called the Bistro and they were apologetic and offered me a free stromboli (or the one I paid for and didn't get) for my next visit. The food was very good though.",

If you like garlic knots, it's worth coming out of your way just to get these.  The pizza was a good value, but just not to my personal taste.  It was definitely New York style, with a strong herbs taste.  It was just a little too much cheese and grease for me, I prefer a lighter style of pizza.   The $4.99 sliders are a fabulous value for a lunch-size meal (although they are available anytime).  The fries could have been a tad more crispy.  The customer service was friendly.  If you like New York style pizza, you should try this place out for sure.",

Problem wasn't with Bistro the  grub hub driver must have dropped it or took a turn to fast when I opened the pizza everything topping had slid to the corner of the box. Had tipped the driver she already left before I opened it. Did the best I could to push the toppings back evenly, really ruined the experience. The pizza was excellent as usual. Really want to give a 1 star but it wasn't Bistros fault was gonna give it a 3 star but settled on a 4 star. CHECK you pizza before the driver leaves!!!!",

You can mask a lot of things, but you cannot hide a bad crust. This crust is very good. Not too thick, not too thin, not too crunchy, not too chewy. The cheese and sauce is the perfect ratio and the grease is just right. I've been coming for pizza for over a year, but just recently, I discovered their chicken wings. OMG! These wings are really good. Go for the pizza. Stay for the wings.",

I placed an order for the chicken sliders and upgraded fries alongs with a small pan pizza with spinach and tomatoes. Not much of a rush, about 4 tickets before mine and waited almost 25 min for my order. Afterwards took my food and went home quickly.  Chicken Sliders: the buns were made out of garlic knots which sounded very good until I opened the box and saw that they were over done, black, and hard on top. The chicken itself was breaded but some how soggy and not seasoned at all, bland and rubbery. It had very little sauce and a whole lot of cheese. A crucnchy garlic bun with over bearing cheese and rubbery chicken. My \"upgraded\" fries were cooked quite nicely but had 0 seasoning and were bland as good be. Had very little cheese and parsley added to it which was the \"upgrade\" Pizza: Thin crust pizza which was quite nice. Sauce to cheese ratio was well done. A bit on the greasy side, like any NY style pizza.  Kind of disappointed in my experience over all. Most likely won't return.",

We found the place easily  (right off the freeway) and dined in. The staff was friendly and seemed in pretty good moods kind of joking around and singing along to some songs. We got the bistro fries, garlic knots and a large pepperoni & sausage. I specifically asked if it was fresh sausage as I don't care for the sliced or frozen type and it was the good fresh stuff. The food was great! My girlfriend normally is not a big pizza fan and she said it was probably the best pizza she has had in Vegas. The fries were gone almost instantly. The garlic knots were warm and I found it hard to not eat them all. The large pizza was huge and delicious. It was such big portiins we ended up taking most of the pizza home. In summary, great east coast style pizza, fun staff, easy to get to, huge portions, delicious!  We have been a couple times since and while the service is still tip notch, the food hasn't always been quite as good. For sure get the garlic knots and fries though.",

There was just dead air like he had no idea what I was talking about.  I arrived about ten minutes earlier than the time they gave me. We expected to wait a few minutes , but we were told they already gave away our order. Huh?????????? We then waited about 35 minutes for them to remake the order. Some sort of small gesture of an apology would have been nice. Was this pizza worthy of an hour and thirty five minute wait??? No. It was ok.  Would I return? Probably not.",

The crust is labeled as thin, but there is plenty of it and it is like no other in Las Vegas. This is proper pizza and made in such a way that I didn't realize that this is what pizza should taste like. The only flaw would be the business hours and the days they are open. Seems they are open like every other day and last Saturday I drive by and notice they are totally closed and dark at 8:30PM.  That is really odd, but I guess you need to catch them when you can, but it is worth it. Will have to try their other foods too.",

The meatball Sandwich was ok, fries we're good. Too many herbs in the sauce. I think they're the precooked ones from costco. They tasted better on the pizza.  The chicken parmigiana was horrible. It wasn't breaded and all I could taste was herbs. I actually spit it out, kids did the same.   Lastly, we had a cheese calzone. It seriously looked fantastic until we cut it open. It was a slab of melted cheese.  It was tasty, but so odd.  I grew up in NY and am very spoiled by great pizza. I'm picky, but my kids like any pizza place & asked that we not go back there Ever again.    Worst $45 ever spent. Such a shame.",

Ordered a medium sausage and black olive pizza. The crust was very good as well as the sausage, cheese, and sauce. The black olives were a bit off and didn't taste quite right though (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Good service and the restaurant, while a small pizzeria, seemed clean. The staff is very friendly as well. Other items on the menu ordered by others looked very good too. I will give it a try again in the near future.",

One Pepperoni and one Hawaiian, along with some Garlic Knots and Wings.  Not only was everything great but there's a Yelp check in offer for half off a pizza.  Total steal.    I did get my  food to-go so I could sit in jammies with my wife and friend while sipping on Mason Jars full of Shandy's, but the inside looked pretty awesome.  Anytime there are trivia, games, or trivia games I'm a happy camper.  I didn't see any beer though, which might be a problem.  Bottom Line:  If you live close to this place, give it a shot.  If you far away, get there and try it.",

    "text": "I came here a while ago and had 'The Thaddius' stromboli...it was so good I decided I had to try the pizza! I noticed that with a Yelp check in between 2-5pm, you get 50% off a pizza! I called in my order around 4pm: large pizza - half sausage and black olives, half pineapple and ham...15 minutes later I picked it up, and it was ready and waiting for me! They charge a flat rate for the pizza ($15 for large) and then charge for each topping seperately ($1.75/topping for large). I liked that since I did a half and half pizza, they only charged me half price for all my toppings rather than the full amount! In total, with the 50% off, it came out to $10 + tip...that's cheaper than most of the chains and this pizza put all the others in this area to shame!  Ok, let's talk about the pizza...thin crust that was crispy, yet not too crispy, and sauce that was out of this world...tasted like tomatoes and complimented the toppings perfectly. The thing that made this pizza so good was the quality of the ingredients used. The crust is made in house, the sauce tasted homemade, and the toppings are top notch. I had sausage on half of my pizza and there was no grease to blot up...like I said, high quality! There was a lot of cheese, which I liked, but if you prefer a pizza with a little less cheese, I'm sure they'd do it if you asked. I felt like the crust, sauce, topping ratio was perfect...thin crust, lots of toppings!  You can tell that Tyler, the owner and chef, takes pride in his work...when you're craving pizza support this local business and give it a try...you will more than likely question why you hadn't gone in sooner!",

    "text": "Great pizza. Awesome stromboli. Good prices. My boyfriend loves this place, he's become a regular.   I am giving 3 stars because most of the time, Bistro gave us a good experience. After hearing great reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I really wanted to love this place. It was just one bad visit that did it.  I've worked in enough restaurants to understand that sometimes, service just breaks down. It happens. What places have to remember is something called service recovery. Acknowledge to the customer what happened, apologize for the inconvenience, and somehow make it worth their while to come back.  I called in a take-out order. He quoted me 30-35 minutes. A little longer than the usual wait, but no problem. I showed up 40 minutes later to see my pizza order just going into the oven! So I waited...and waited...and waited. There was no explanation, no acknowledgment that it'll be a moment, just asked me what my order was. Meanwhile, I saw one guy trying to ask a fellow employee to assist topping pizzas, which she attempted, but moved oh so slowly. Customers who were eating there and done were standing around and waiting for their checks. Another man came in to pick up after me and wasn't even greeted. When my pizza was finally boxed and I went up to pay, the man didn't say one word about the chaos. No \"Sorry about the wait.\" Not one word about how long I waited for my call-in order.   Will I return? Maybe. There's still a bad taste in my mouth, though.   3 stars is more than I want to give, but I do recall the good visits. Hopefully, it'll be better in the future.",

I've seen previous reviews that mention the owner not being there and the employees being less than inviting.   So did I mention that I've never eaten here? Here's why.   I called and asked about delivery services. Can't deliver until 430pm. Fair enough. I am willing to pickup. After telling me they can't deliver, I'm immediately put on hold. I wait for a couple of minutes. Two maybe. I get a man on the phone that states in a \"were slammed and I don't want to answer the phone\" type tone and asks \"what can I do for you?\" What??? I say I'd like to place an order. His response \"I said what can I do for you\". Ok. Not exactly a friendly greeting but I'll roll with it.   I begin to place my order and I'm put back on hold with no warning. I hung the phone up and I'm sure I won't be calling back.   If the owner reads this, that's how you lose business in under 4 minutes. I hope you get this issue resolved before it really starts affecting more potential customers.   Thanks.",

The dough is phenomenal and cooked just right. Toppings are generous and fresh - you're not searching for your toppings here!  Lastly, the service seals the deal.

We ordered the pizza and wings special that is listed on the website. Gent who answered the phone was not too sure about the special and had to ask another co-worker about it. Our order was for take out and the pizza and wings were ready in 15 minutes as promised. Nice booths along the wall for people who want to dine in.   We ordered a large mushroom and cheese pizza (extra crispy) and the wings Buffalo style (medium heat). Pizza looked and smelled great. It passed the old \"NY test\" and did not slump over and you could eat it with just one hand. Crust was delicious. Was not the best pizza we have had in Vegas but it was near the top. The mushrooms were plenty and they were certainly fresh. Solid pizza, we enjoyed it.   The wings were mediocre and I was disappointed with the sauce and what they call \"blue cheese.\" Buffalo Wings are made to be paired with blue cheese dressing and for some reason restaurants on the west coast like to give you ranch dressing? The blue cheese dressing they gave me tasted like ranch and it was really watery. Passed on it and used my own in the fridge. I asked for extra wing sauce on the side and this was also very watery. Tasted OK but it was too wet and watery and did not coat the wing properly. Need to work on the sauce, you can do better.   Great pizza but they should pay better attention to the ole chicken wing. It's not a side item and it derives the same amount of love you put in the pizza pies.   But we will be back and give it another chance. Try some other items as the guy cooking assured me that everything was homemade and delicious.",

It was awesome :) The chicken Parmesan was wonderful (I particularly liked the taste of the marinara) and I would highly recommend upgrading to the bistro fries! Both were delicious, and not only was the food great, but the service was fantastic. The guys working were very tentative and friendly, and were completely on it! You can also draw on the wax papers at the tables, so that was fun!",

    "text": "We had a coupon for Bistro and had seen it in the shopping center a few times so we decided to go for it.    First, the service is excellent!  We realized right before ordering that this coupon (free garlic knots with pizza) was expired.  My husband told the owner (I think) on the phone and he was happy to throw in the garlic knots.  Well who has two thumbs and is a total space cadet?!? THIS GIRL (points to self with thumbs, you get the idea).  I left the coupon at home :(  He was totally cool about it and gave them to us anyway.  We promised to bring him two expired coupons next time, LOL.    The food was terrific.  There are a few obsessive questions that every NY'er asks him or herself about pizza to determine if it meets the high pizza standards we uphold: Is the sauce-to-cheese ratio good?  Is it a decently thin crust?  Can I fold it over without completely and utterly destroying it?  Are the crust and sauce awesome?  The answer is unequivocally YES to all of these questions.  Not only did I totally love the pizza but the garlic knots were delightful.  Perfect amount of garlic and soft yet with a slight crunch.  I was so pleased.    The interior has some booths and tables that you can dine in at.  I especially liked looking at the kiddos' drawings that were hung on the side of the counter.  There were some pretty good ones too! haha, better than anything I could come up with!   This will be our go-to local pizza place!",

Since I'm not used to eating fried food and grease, I got sick, but only because I overdid it. Had 2 slices of pizza, 2 wings, and 2 garlic knots. Next time I'll have 1 slice of pizza, 1 wing, and 1 garlic knot. My daughter had barbecue chicken wings and absolutely loved them! The service is great, the food is bomb, and the employees are warm, welcoming, and pretty darn funny. The guy at the register made a few jokes, which made the experience even more better, especially since it had been kind of a rough day. 2 thumbs up. My fiance, my daughter, and I will definitely go again!",

A late Saturday lunch afforded us a mere 30 minute wait for takeout.   I ordered a Pepperoni Pizza, a Bistro Salad, and Garlic Knots. The order of Garlic Knots was free with Yelp check-in. The Pepperoni Pizza was pretty good. It isn't the best pizza in the area, but still good. It certainly wasn't lacking on cheesy goodness. The Garlic Knots were covered in butter and parmesan. They were good as well. The Bistro Salad isn't a traditional salad and more a blend of salad ingredients without lettuce. This was okay.  Bistro Pizza is definitely a good option if you are in the area.",

The pizza had really fresh tasting ingredients. The cheese was perfect, it didn't slide off and was an excellent consistency. The sauce was maybe a 3/5 for me, as there was no kick to it, but it also was far from bland. The crust was also pretty amazing- thin and crunchy where it needed to be but just a tad soggy in the most dense parts (where the ingredients were concentrated).  The spinach artichoke dip was likely the best I've ever tasted and I eat this a lot. There were giant chunks of artichoke and the spinach tasted so fresh (definitely not frozen spinach (and if it is, I'd be so shocked). They do not skimp out on the amount of artichoke. The dip was so creamy, not hardened or too firm. A perfect consistency, personally speaking.  We also had the mozzarella sticks and Stromboli which were equally good but not things that stood out as much as the two things mentioned above.  Lastly, we had the meatballs which were moist and quite large. I thought the overall value was incredible.  I won't be ordering from any other pizza places for a while. We were all pleasantly surprised by the overall good taste, value and quality of this food.",

    "text": "Finally! Daughter's dance studio is next door, so we've been smelling this place for sometime. Have heard rave reviews about all their food, but our experience is limited to kids plus me and a small pizza. Half cheese,  half tomato and spinach, all good! Daughter even had a slice of the spinach and tomato.  Slices of Roma tomato and what looked to be fresh spinach. I mention fresh spinach because I've ordered spinach on my pizza at other Vegas locations and it was gloppy, like frozen yuck. This was perfect! Can't wait to return and bring husband. Looked like some tasty calzone combinations available and will need to try the meatballs and garlic knots.",

Delivered HOT to me in 35 mins, was a great topping selection.    The only way to improve this is to add Basil and Oregano to the top.  I asked and they were out.  Add basil and Oregano you will love this pizza!!!!",

Pizza is great!! We ordered two, one with pineapple and ham, the other with pepperoni, sausage, meatball and extra cheese. Crust is light and crispy, and the meatballs are amazing!!   The service we received was great, food was delivered to our table quickly and everyone was so friendly. While we were eating, the soda machine ran out of syrup in the one I was drinking, I was quickly given an ice cold can of soda so that I would not go without a beverage while eating, that to me is attention to detail and means a lot.

Also had the gatlic knots...fantastic and the bistro fries, we used to go to a place that had what they called italian fries whick were just like the bistro fries but with marinara and melted cheese on them wish they had that here. Expensive especially if you order several side items and the cost of extra items on the pizza is outragous but when we have extra money we would come back here, not often but maybe every once in awhile.",

Marinara sauce straight from the can with no additions, tasted like watery flavorless acidy tomatoes. Pizza was undercooked and had to request them to cook it for another 20 minutes. Who wants droopy pizza that cannot stand up by itself....really? The baked rigatoni was the star of the show earning 3 stars out of 5 for being the least messed up, and having some good flavors. Will not be returning here again, unless I hear things have changed for the better. You could tell that there were no owners or mangers present. It was a millennial duo cook-off - the only thing missing was the microwave and the frozen burritos. Sorry guys you are going to have to try WAY harder than this; as the only one's that you are fooling are the one's with $8 bucks left in their pockets for dinner.",

    "text": "As soon as you step foot into Bistro, you get that fresh baked Italian bread smell. Even if you weren't hungry, you will be after that aroma.  It's a pizza joint, I will make this review short, simple, and to the point.  Positives: -Family owned and operated. They use homemade recipes and fresh ingredients. My belly thanks you for that.  -East coast style pizza. There are about 4 places in Vegas that have True Jersey pizza, this is one.  -Great service. They take care of their regulars. We are grateful. -RANCH!! Like the best ever!   Negatives: -The delivery is only SOMEtimes, and when they're busy, you are looking at an hour wait, MINIMUM! Step up your game, and have a driver on call 24-7.  -The ghost pepper fries. I am a fan of spicy, but don't tease me with ghost peppers if it is only a dry season blend of semi spicy flavor. FAIL.  -The wings are just ok. The sauce on them is great, but if you want chicken, stick with the fingers over wings.   I personally love their location, but I think if they were to open a second location in a more central area, they may get more than the Henderson local love. However, this is a SOLID choice for a slice if you are in the area.",

We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it was excellent. The staff was courteous and very helpful.  The cashier/manager? was a sweetheart. She was helpful, honest and professional. Price was surprisingly inexpensive! We are hooked! Nice work Bistro Pizza!",

    "text": "The good reviews are True, folks.  I'm pretty picky about my pizza.  I was dubious about trying Bistro Pizza because the pizza place that used to exist in its spot was very \"meh\".  I know that's silly, but whatever.  Anyway, today I found myself without a vehicle and this place is right across the street, so I decided that today was the big day.  Now, I don't normally like calzones.  However, based on the good Yelp reviews, I went in with the notion that I would try a calzone or stromboli.  I got a calzone with ham, mozzarella, pineapple, onion, and roasted red pepper (it's a house special...don't remember the name).  WOW.  WOW is all that is needed... but for the sake of being complete, I'll give you a description.  The crust was light, flaky, and perfectly seasoned.  It was baked to absolute perfection.  My main complaint with calzones is that they're usually doughy and raw in spots (maybe I've had bad ones, but that's my experience).  Not this one.  It couldn't have been better.  The inside was filled with very fresh-tasting pineapple and other high-quality ingredients.  It came with a side of marinara, which was flavorful and pleasant.  The service was exceptional and the place was very clean.  The man making the pizzas looked like a real pizza chef rather than some greasy-looking skater punk like you might expect at a local pizza place.  Overall, Bistro Pizza gives the appearance of being a high-brow pizza place without the high cost.  The tables all have interesting books on them to read while you wait... a very cool touch.  My calzone was $10, which I consider to be very reasonable given that I'll get two meals out of it.  I was highly impressed with this place, and I'm glad there's something so delicious near my apartment now!  Try Bistro Pizza.  You won't regret it!",

I tried the all meat Stromboli (pepperoni, ham, and sausage). The owner (Tyler) let me know that marinara sauce was actually baked in the Stromboli and recommended it over the calzone for that reason. The dough was so good that I didn't even need to use the  extra side of wonderful marinara sauce that came with it.   TIP---- Save your receipt because you can get 1/2 off your next pizza purchase up to four days after your initial visit. With food this good, I might not be able to wait 4 hours before I come back.   I am so happy Tyler has decided to open his own restaurant- he has a good product. I can't wait to try the pizza and wings next time......  *****UPDATE ***** I came back within 4 days and tried the pizza. I wanted to love the pizza, but left disappointed. The pizza is ordinary, and I had to adjust my rating  accordingly.",

After placing the order of garlic knots (yum!), ham & mushroom pizza, and a sausage & pepperoni, we got to color \"on the table\".  It's a nice touch for kiddos (and adults) who like to have something to while we wait.  Our garlic knots came quickly!  They were buttery, crispy on the outside, and doughy (not in the \"undercooked\" doughy category, the just right category).  They tasted amazing with the marinara sauce!  Not long after, our pizzas came!  They were so delicious! Crispy and chewy at the same time.  I thought it had the perfect amount of sauce.  My hubby mentioned he would have liked a bit more sauce.  I'm sure he could order it with more!  Thanks, Bistro Pizza!  We will be back!",

My bar for this being from the east coast originally is Manco and Manco's pizza on the boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ.  Fresh dough that is hand stretched and homemade as is the sauce, flavorful but not overhwhelming oregano or other spices, and tasty toppings.  They have all that here and it is the closest to Manco and Manco's I have found so far in the west.  The pizza is cooked so the dough has a crisp edge but just the right amount of chewiness.  Great cheese and not so much as to be gloppy.  I wish we had opportunity to try more of their offerings, the kids weren't very adventurous and we only did a half pepperoni and half black olive.  Next trip I guess!  The chef and the staff was very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in providing a superior product and assuring a satisfied customer.  Location is in a strip mall, basic walk in pizzeria with some booths easy to find off the 215 freeway and the sign on the street just says Pizza.  We did miss the part that they are closed on Tuesday so had to make a second trip on Wednesday but very glad we did.  They don't serve alchohol but you are a fool if you pass up this pizza and the very nice people that make it over that.",

Me and a few friends needed to cure some Sunday morning hangovers before we went out drinking again for Superbowl Sunday. We were visiting Las Vegas from AZ so we didn't know the area well at all. My friend stumbled upon this little joint on Yelp and we were all craving some pizza. We decided to come check it out. We ordered a 16' half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken pizza. My friend is from NY and LOVES buffalo chicken pizza. He says it's impossible to find good buffalo chicken pizza in our hometown of Phoenix, AZ. Well we found it here. Not only was the pepperoni half great, but the other half of our pizza was so good that my friend from NY wanted to personally tell Tyler how good it was. Outside of his home state, he said it was the best buffalo chicken pizza he has ever had anywhere on the west coast. We also ordered some garlic knots which were very tasty. Tyler was super friendly and came and talked to us about his restaurant and how he got started. We enjoyed every minute of our experience at his restaurant. Keep up the great work, Tyler! We will DEFINITELY be coming by again next time we are in town.",

    "text": "I wanted Bistro to be on of those unique gems of an establishment, but alas, they may have a second restaurant somewhere.  No matter- the food was very good. The pizzas are legit, and the best way I can put this is this: you smell every ingredient and it's quality you can taste after you put it in your mouth to masticate it.  If you order your pizza 'Stuffed', prepare to get the sauce on the side, as all but your sauce was stuffed in what only can be described as a Flying Saucer of baked dough and pizza ingredients. If you normally a two slice guy or girl, one slice of the Stuffed pizza may do you in.  Pro Tip 1: Eat it while its hot. Even if you got it for 'take out' and once you're home you need to nuke a slice for 15-30 second.  Pro Tip 2: If you're waiting inside at that round corner table, take a shot at drawing something. You will notice the best drawing based on some secret evaluation criteria get cut out and go up on their walls.  Pro Tip 3: Their ranch dressing is legit and great for dipping pizza in. They don't carry weak, uninteresting ranch here.  The only downside is that the costs can really start adding up the more you add to your pizza. Ask them if they have any specials going on before you order.  Take out was on time, and the one time I get delivery it was handled efficiently by Grub Hub, and they may have even come 5 minutes earlier than they predicted.  I will be getting more pizza from here, I like it more than the franchise pizza joint across the street.   Thanks for reading!",

The atmosphere is okay and the people seem nice enough. This is more resembling of a mom and pop pizza shop in some big city (but the pizza is okay and note destination-worthy).   I'd stop again if in the vicinity, but wouldn't travel out of my way to go here. Prices were okay and, I keep repeating myself,the pizza was okay. Maybe I should order a fancier pie next time. We had a young one, and he didn't complain. But he did get transfixed with one of the televisions, so take that for what it's worth. He actually loved going out front of the shop and running around the benches and up and down the sidewalk. So think of that as a diversion if you go.  I repeat myself- good pizza. But not spectacular. It has the same ole same ole feeling that hundreds of shops do.",

The reviews did not disappoint! I would give this place a five star, but it was so damn hot in the dining room that it was uncomfortable. We all had something different to eat and everything was really good. The customer service was amazing, the guy who took our order was super friendly. Each of us like something different about the place... Good location, fantastic food, and the affordability. We will definitely come back again, but if it's as hot as it was last night we may not. Just a suggestion to the owner!",

    "text": "3.5-4 Stars. I agree with many reviewers, this is some of the better pizza I've had in Henderson from a more traditional pizzeria. The ingredients are high quality and with a simple, straightforward menu, the product really shines. Placing a phone order on a Sunday during peak time was a 45 min wait.   We had a medium pepperoni pizza with an order of garlic knots- the best part for me! They were so fluffy and flavorful, even better dipped in the perfect marinara. Pizza was good, but cut incredibly lazily by the same person working the counter, leaving no two slices the same, two being about 3 inches long- not cool and not up to health code standards.   I would definitely be interested in trying some of their pastas or entree meals next time and would imagine we will be back for pizza takeout in the future, but probably not with any great haste.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places in town, for several reasons. My followers know I very rarely eat at chains, it's just what I like. This is a family run business that takes much pride in their work. The ambiance is casual and comfortable, and you can see the crew making your food as ordered. And it's every bit worth the little extra wait. Let's face it, fast, cheap pizza is fast and cheap for a reason. And many people are ok with that. I'm not.  I'm very picky about my calzone. Some places try to overdo it. Bistro nails it. The dough is soft and fluffy, not heavy, and baked to perfection, not like a brick. It fluffy up so big that the to-go box it comes in can't be closed! Inside is more deliciousness. High quality mozzarella that when you tilt your back just falls into your mouth.  Accompanied by creamy ricotta. Not all cheese is equal! You can absolutely tell the difference in the high quality here. Then there is the spinach. It is fresh! Not frozen and chopped. And the garlic is fresh, not that stuff in a jar. It is all rounded out with the most delicious marinara, of which I love so much I order extra. This is what guilty pleasures are made of.  Then, there is my son, spaghetti connoisseur. This is the only place, outside of my kitchen, that he will order it. And he is a tough critic!  If you aren't hungry by now, I haven't done my job. Do yourself a favor, next time you want Italian, check this gem out. You can thank me later.  Ciao!",

    "text": "BISTRO PIZZZZZAAAAAA IS THE SPOT!!!!     I am so upset that it took me a year and a half of living here before finding this perfect Mom and pop pizza joint! This spot screams quintessential neighborhood pizzeria.   The smell is inviting and smiling faces on \"The line\" are quick to greet and assist you.    We started with a Bistro salad and bistro fries (thanks to all the yelp suggestions,) and I'm so happy we did. The veggies in this salad are so flavorful. whatever they marinade the tomatoes in is phenomenal. My non tomato eating husband was eating them. This says a lot y'all.  The salad is full, and the perfect amount for two plates full and maybe even a little to take home!   The fries. Omg those bistro fries. They came out smoking hot and smelt like heaven. We're hooked. If you are a French fry lover, this is A total must with every order. There wasn't a fry left behind. This was the first empty plate.   We ordered a LARGE pepperoni pizza and got a FREE order of garlic knots with a yelp check in! **scoreeeee** Both my 4 year old and husband were drooling over their pie as they mmm'ed with each bite.   I ordered a small pizza with onion, artichoke, and green peppers. IT WAS SO SO SO SO TASTY. The only tip I would give for a veggie pizza would be ask for an extra sauce. Their sauce is next level. For real.... I wanted to drink it.   We got all of our food for around 40 bucks. It was an incredible price for the amount of food that we bought. Can't wait for tomorrow's leftovers and I especially can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "02/25/2019  I recently ordered a Stromboli from Bistro for the first time. I've eaten Bistro Pizza food dozens of times, but the pizza is so good, that I haven't ventured very far outside of that menu item (tried the wings once, see below). I decided to order the Thaddeus Stromboli, with extra cheese. I cut it in half, and after taking my first bite, I was pretty sure it was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth! Great balance of meats, the cheese was great, and the crust was perfectly cooked. Shouldn't be surprised, as Tyler and his staff regularly knock it out of the park, but I was oh so pleasantly surprised at just how,good the Stromboli was. I highly recommend you put this in your Bistro Pizza selection rotation, you will not regret it! Really not much else to say   I added my first review of Bistro Pizza on 3/6/13. I was very impressed with the pizza. Since then, I have visited many times, always leaving with a quality, well made, well cooked pie.  I was in the area today, and had read several reviews extolling the virtues of the Bistro Buffalo Chicken Wings. I ordered a LG Pie and 8 Wings Medium. Having spent 25 years in Upstate NY, I consider myself an expert on what Buffalo Wings should taste like, and what the texture should be. Spent many afternoons at the Anchor Bar, and other dives along the NYS Thruway serving amazing Wings. If you call your Wings Buffalo Wings, you have to do them right. I'll put two columns below when rating Bistros Buffalo Wings, the general flavor, and how Buffalo Wings should taste. I've eaten some great Chicken Wings that were not Buffalo Wings         Metric.               Chicken Wing.        Buffalo Wing.      Reason  Chicken Quality.

As I walked in the door, I believe I saw Tyler move over to the fryer and dump the wings that were hanging over the hot oil from the fry basket into the sauce bowl. I winced as I assumed they were sitting over the oil losing their crisp skin. They couldn't have been there long, but long enough to not have the required crispy crunch when you bite into them. I did test two in the parking lot to be fair. Acceptable in Vegas, but a Hangin' offense in Upstate NY. The wings were still good, but next time ( and there will be a next time) I'll call when I'm 7 or so minutes away and add the Buffalo Wings to my Pizza order.  The Bistro wings are definitely worth trying, some time I will eat on site and burn myself as they are right out of the oil.  I will then revisit this post and adjust as necessary.  Keep up the great work Tyler!",

    "text": "I came here after reading the reviews. I have bounced around between pizzerias in town and was hoping to find one closer to where I live that I could count on. After moving to town from my native NYC you could say I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but not enough of a snob where I can't/won't admit a good find.  First thing I noticed is that they don't greet you. Maybe if they weren't busy and were waiting for an order they would, but they were moderately busy and there were multiple guys behind the counter. Each and every guy that was behind the counter looked at me at separate intervals, but not once did anybody say \"how you doing, just give us a second here.\" I don't need handholding, but  some sort of \"be right with you\" would have been cool.  Guy who took my order was quick and efficient. I ordered and I waited, decent sized order and wait time matched what I ordered, which was fine. They even had it done a bit quicker that I had anticipated. I was taking it to go.  Redeemed the Yelp offer for free garlic knots with a large pizza ordered, which they forgot to give me (the knots lol.) Luckily I said something while still there, and they gladly handled that on the spot. Better to have it happen there than discovering it once I got home.  Ok, now to the food:   Lg. White Pizza with pepperoni & fresh garlic - very little grease (which is hard to do on a pizza with cheese and pepperoni, so kudos there.) Dough could have been more crisp, but I had read reviews about their crust and knew what to expect. Still really tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings. Nice guys!  Medium Wings - They were ok. I think they would have been better eaten in, not ordered to go.   Bistro Fries - not bad, just not my cup of tea. Saw pictures on the site/yelp with what looked like stringy cheese. Yeah, there was none of that. One of the reviews raves about them, I wasn't that fond of them. Personal taste, they were fine...I just wouldn't order them again.   Garlic Knots - tasty, crisp...loved 'em.   Overall I really like this place! If you come back with your receipt you get half off a pizza within three days...nice touch! I think next time I visit I will order to eat in, I'm confident I will be even more pleased with an order fresh out of the oven.   Thanks guys! Good stuff! I'll be back!  Tyler: Thanks for your reply, seems altogether a lost art these days. I wasn't blaming you guys for the travel ability of the food, I definitely got the feeling it was travel time induced lol. Still overall a good experience and it will most likely be one of many more.  Thanks again! I appreciate you guys!",

While I have walked in and ordered what I wanted (after checking out their website to see what online deals he is offering), you can take home a menu and order over the phone.  Since this isn't pizza hut/domino's, your pizza isn't made on an assembly line and will take time to make and bake.    Don't forget the amazing bistro salad, yummy garlic knots & bistro fries.  I think that they have calzones and such, but when the pizza is this good, I don't bother to stray.",

I opted for carry out. I arrived a little early and they offered me a free drink while I waited. The guy who was running the register, who I assumed was the manager, was super friendly.  When he brought me my pizza, I opened it up to look at it. It wasn't that I thought it might be messed up, I just love pizza and wanted to see it! It looked great!  On my way out, he thanked me again and warned me against the dangers of eating and driving. :)  The reason for the four stars, and not a perfect review, is due to the pizza crust. It was too tough for my liking.   Crust aside, I will absolutely go back and will recommend to all of my friends. Great staff and really good food!",

The cheese is not grease laden like the cheaper places throw at you (clears throat... Metro).  The only marginal gripe is that the sauce is a little bland and underwhelming but not a deal breaker.  Everyone loves the free 'check-in' knots, but it's just too much dough for me.  They're giant and tasty balls of dough that could be a meal unto themselves, but if that's your thing...  I feel like they're 4 stars and buying all the 5 stars with those knots... Hats off ;)",

I am picky with the dough and sauce and then the cheese follows and last the toppings. So if all goes well I have discovered a new favorite and Bistro Pizza just does it right!.    We ordered a half white with mushrooms and basil, and a half pepperoni, salami, and pineapple and enjoyed each bite until the last one.     They also have a great Yelp check in offer which takes a percentage off a large pizza so make sure to check in before ordering.  The place is also very inviting and you can find books, magazines, and board games",

They were nice enough..It seemed like a really chill family like place.  The menu isn't big, but that's always a good sign when it comes to Italian food. Smaller menu, usually means better quality.  We got to bottled snapped drinks from their fridge section. Then ordered a small ham, pinapple and bacon pizza, an order of the chicken parm sliders, with the cheesy herb fries.   We asked about the free garlic knots with the yelp check in. The owner (I'm guessing?) Told us it's only when you get a large one topping or more pizza. We said cool, no problem. (We're bad at reading fine print lol.) But this really cool kid making the pizzas in the back came out and gave us two garlic knots anyway. He was awesome.   The manager or owner delivered the pizza to out table super quick. Everyrhing was super hot and fresh tasting. The pizza was delicious. Huge peices of ham and the crust was perfect. The sliders were so good. I think they needed more sauce, but that's just my personal preference. The fries were super garlicky (sp?) And flavorful.   All in all, this place was great. We'll definitely be back.",

This place is located in an unassuming strip mall off the 215/Gibson. I had recently purchased a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> voucher for $25 off a $37.50 order with intentions on trying a couple different menu items.   We arrived at 11 am on a Sunday, the Yelp hours posted said they opened at that time, turns out they don't open until noon, but they were nice enough to let us in and serve us. We started out with the most delicious, crisp Coke I've ever had (better than McDonald's Coke) why is this so exciting? Because I love a good soda with my pizza. Onto the garlic knots, best I've had, so soft and chewy and the perfect amount of seasoning. We decided to try the cheese pizza and add pineapple and jalepenos and a white pizza with sausage/garlic/tomatoes. Both were perfect. The crust was out of this world crazy good, flaky and just enough crunch. I'm not a huge sausage fan, but it tasted like it was made in house. Fantastic.   We had a huge amount of leftovers I took home, I re-heated it for dinner, and to my surprise, it was just a delicious the second time around (reheated in the oven of course, not the microwave) the crust still had a good crunch to it. They also have ranch which is a huge plus. This place is awesome.",

Perhaps Tyler mixes this dough with some of that magic dust, because the crust is still crispy after 30 minutes and taste even better after a few minutes in the oven the next morning.  One thing for sure, Bistro makes a killer pizza, and the owner will bend over backwards to make his customer happy, because on my last visit to Bistro I walked in 15 minutes after his posted closing, and he still made me a pizza.

I may have to try them again to solidify my opinion but I do not see that happening since they're a little bit of a drive and there is pizza near by that I really like. The location is pretty spacious and one thing I liked is that they have scrabble! Corny? SO! You can play scrabble while you wait for your pizza! What I did not like is that the guy behind the counter had dirty nails and confessed to work in a body shop too. Needles to say, I was really worried about getting the pizza there but thankfully he wasn't the one making it. The chef's hands and nails were perfectly clean :)",

The garlic knots are delish and the marinara, even better! They have a great lunch special for a personal (6 small slices) pizza and drink for $6.99. I would highly recommend them! Hope they open more around town. :)",

    "text": "If you enjoy pizza sold at the airport or bus station, this is your place.  If you think this pizza is good at all, it's time to visit a different state and try pizza elsewhere.  Even bad pizza in California can run circles around this horrible pizza place.  They claim to make thin crust pizza -- we received a dry puffy WHITE crust (nothing golden) that resembled a product made from instant or  frozen dough.  The sauce tasted like it came from a can and had no herbs and/or spices.  The cheese was cheap  Sbarro quality (look where they ended up).  The reviews for this establishment are GROSSLY exaggerated.  We should have known this restaurant was a DUD because the menu contains buffalo wings and other hihgly processed frozen appetizer crap.  Customer service was also void at this restaurant.  The gentleman with the glasses and beard even ignored my husband as he stood at the counter trying to place an order.  Never as much lifted his head.",

Bistro's pizza is nice and thin with the right amount of toppings and cheese. I probably will ask for less tomato sauce next time, but that's just me since I'm not into a ton of tomato sauce. I loved the pepperoni and sausage, which reminded me a bit of Round Table Pizza--a favorite pizza place of mine in California. However, Bistro's was much better. I tried the meatball with garlic, but the meatballs had a slight gamey taste. Otherwise, it wasn't too bad. Overall, I really enjoyed the pizza and absolutely loved the garlic knots.",

(please bear with me, this is my first yelp review)  ambiance: casual pizza-place decor. there was a scrabble game going on one of the tables in the front, i liked that.  service: wonderful. i did take out, so i walked right up to the counter where there was only one guy working. he was incredibly friendly and helped us pick out what to order while preparing other people's orders. i enjoy watching the cooking process so it was interesting to watch my food being made.  food: we ordered a stromboli and a large pizza.  stromboli: my friend described it as a \"bad ass hot pocket\". we ordered \"the thaddius\" which was cheese, marinara, ham, sausage, pepperoni and salami wrapped in dough. it is also served with a side of marinara sauce to dip in. it is cut in two, so great to split for 2 people. (the thaddius was $10)  pizza: we ordered half chicken half pineapple. both were delicious, the cheese melts beautifully and tastes wonderful. the dough is crispy on the outside but nice and soft in the middle. the amount of toppings we got (both chicken and pineapple) was very generous. all ingredients were very fresh.  i will definitely be going back.",

I ordered a plain cheese pie and a pepperoni pie for lunch for my employees. First let me say that walking in, I had high hopes! It smelled fantastic! A good sign. The set up also reminded me of a pizza place I might see in NY, so bonus points for that.   Both were 'large' pies, but not the usual 18\" large that I'm used to. The crust had good flavor, but I think if they used the same amount of dough and stretched it the extra two inches, it would be just a little thinner. Then if they cooked it a few minutes longer, it would get that bottom of the crust snap that NY pizza has. It was just a little too chewy. (Also, if they are making the crust on site, what water are they using? That makes a huge difference in bread products.)  The sauce was decent, better than expected. I think they could use a little more cheese, but I'm a cheese monster so I won't ding them for it.   All in all, considering some of the other 'options' that are around, I thought it was pretty good.",

The garlic knots are cooked to cheesy-garlicy-PERFECTION right before your eyes.   If you want Americanized-Italian food... This isn't the place to go. If you want a little hole in the wall that is straight out of Sicily, this is your place.   One of my favorite things about this experience was the \"family\" environment the staff at with one another. They were joking, laughing, smiling, not only with their guests but with each other. It really added to my experience knowing that they WANTED to be there, not just forced too.  If you want great home style affordable Italian food without the artificial glam of the Vegas strip -- say hello to your new Italian family!",

The order was fresh out of the oven hot and ready to go when I walked in the door and the staff is very pleasant.    I got the garlic knots and a large pizza with my favorite topping of tomato slices.  The garlic knots are very chewy and include a hint of garlic and Parmesan.  The pizza crust is slightly thicker than a thin crust and not overly doughy and the toppings were fresh, for this almost-gourmet pizza.  The people here are number one in customer service in Henderson and greater Las Vegas for pizza.",

We also got the garlic knots, which I liked more than the pizza. It's hard to go wrong with soft bread covered in garlic and butter! Overall, the food here is 3/5 stars.   Service here however is 5 stars. Our pizza was promptly brought to our table, and even though it's not really waiter service here, the guy who delivered our pizza refilled our drinks and brought us waters. He was also very quick to bring a little cup of ranch to my friend.   I'll be back in the future, but mostly due to the good deal from my school.",

Cal zone was nice & crispy and not leaking grease like so many other pizza places in Henderson. Definitely enjoyed my first time there & gonna grab some garlic knots next time.

On days that I want to take my lounging to extremes, I order takeout from Bistro Pizza plus garlic knots. I hate myself for eating an entire pizza myself, but the experience is worth sharing with all of you if it means that they can gain customers on my loss of hope in my future beach body. The pizza is very delicious, the flavor is as you would expect from a pizza, cheesy with the right amount of toppings. The sausage is plain enough for you to taste the sausage and not over-salted or over-cooked like some establishments will do. At Bistro Pizza your pizza is made just the way you want it.  The garlic knots are a good complement to my pizza and an effective nail into the proverbial coffin that is my New Years resolutions.  Bistro pizza even has board games if you want to eat your pizza with friends (of course I didn't go with that option). Their service is friendly as you'd find at most pizza places, but I liked Bistro Pizza mainly because it's across the street.  For a guilt-free experience in getting good pizza, be sure to check out Bistro Pizza and enjoy your night of delicious sausage pizza and self-reflection.",

With a good average in reviews, we thought we would give it a shot.   It's always a challenge to eat at pizza places when it's just me and my daughter.  Pizzas are too large and we end up taking most of it home. So we ordered a medium which was likely going to lead to us being able to take some home for a later meal. Didn't mind that idea with the other photos of pizza I've seen here.   We wanted to redeem the free garlic knots but a large was too aggressive for us. He let us do it anyway because with all of our toppings we exceeded the price of a large 1 topping.  Woohoo!  The garlic knots arrived first, super hot but smelling so delicious it was hard to have patience and wait for them to cool off!  Garlic knots were so amazing!  Loved them!   Pizza came out quickly and we dove right in. The cheese dripped from the slice as we picked it up...always an indication that this pizza was gonna be AWESOME!!! ...and it definitely was.   Overall, the food was amazing",

Although I was bummed Chris didn't have anymore garlic knots or lasagna, I did order the alfredo and a baked rigatoni which he explained was similar to the lasagna. The alfredo was TO DIE FOR. Definitely would have been a plus with broccoli. It came with a side salad (I want to say romaine and mixed lettuces) that was pretty big, and a tasty homemade balsamic vinegar. To go was ready in about 15-20 minutes. Will definitely return for the alfredo and to try a pizza. Dine in available too.",

We were from out of town and didn't know if someone will come to the table to take order or we were supposed to order at the counter. I went to the counter, and waited again and was continued ignored. We left. I understand they were busy and popular, but in my book that was a poor service!!!  They made me feel stupid!  We left and walked in to the Jack in the Box in the same shopping center. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted immediately. A staff said to us, I'll be right with you. Their staff were also all busy doing something!",

They didn't seem to mind and were joking with each other and smiles on their faces. It was a very comfortable environment, especially with all the paintings that kid customers drew.

Tucked in a small plaza in between a Kumon and a salon, this out of the way pizzeria is sure to attract some attention with its New York style pizza, especially with how they have deals for every day of the week.  When trying to judge a pie, you have to go back to the basics and as such, when you're judging a New York slice, you have to go for a plain cheese. But simplicity does not mean lackluster. The dough was thin and crispy with just enough charred bubbles to really compliment the tomato sauce. And surprisingly, while there was a generous slather of cheese on top,it didn't grease through the box as many other pizzas do.  Along with the cheese pizza, we also decided to try a stuffed meat and bell pepper pizza with mushrooms. And while the cheese pizza is king, this one did not disappoint. The extra layer of cheese and the golden brown crust made the consistency a little fluffier, perfect for those who want something more akin to a Chicago slice. But the real star was their housemade marinara that was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy.",

A bit of a crust on the outside and doughy and delicious on the inside with garlic butter drizzled over top served with a delicious marinara for dunking. A must get when you come here.   The wings were fantastic! Perfect crisp outside and moist and tender inside. I loved the sweet chili hot sauce too. So far 2 for 2....now the pie. We ordered a large onion, mushroom and meatball pizza. It came out steaming hot and absolutely loaded with toppings. We loved it!!! A perfect mix of a crisp bottom crust, sauce, tons of toppings and cheese. Could only eat two pices after we demolished the knots and wings but bonus on taking leftovers home.  Looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu but since we live so close, this place will definetly be our goto for pizza, wings and knots.",

His crust is better, his pizza is the best I've had in Vegas in the last decade. I grew up in the Hudson Valley of New York (the epicenter for Pizza) and I honestly say that you need to support Tyler. It's not everyday an entrepreneur provides a superior product and delivers it at a great price. Everyday you settle for Domino's, Pizza-hut, or Papa John's you are cheating yourself. Tyler has the experience and it shows in his end product. This place is an absolute gem and us Henderson residents need to get the word out. I'm in for a pizza a week til' I croak.",

When I arrived, the owner was busy making pizzas. We ordered a large, 3 topping pizza, 2 orders of garlic bread, medium wings, and teriyaki wings to go. Probably waited about 20 minutes for our order. The food was GREAT! We enjoyed ALL of it. Next time I'm going to try some of the pasta. Can't wait to go back. Owner was friendly. Runs a nice little restaurant.",

Salad was fresh crisp mixed greens with a generous portion of chopped tomatoes marinated in a balsamic vinagrette.  We ordered chicken parmesan and  pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The chicken was not breaded but moist and delicous with a good tomato sauce. The pizza dough was seasoned and cooked well. Mushrooms appear to be sauteed beforehand and not just thrown on the pizza.  The chef, (possibly owner?) greeted us right away and was very friendly.   Looks like we found ourselves a nice little neighborhood pizza joint.",

Honestly not a big pizza fan after consuming a large amount of Pizza Hut and Papa John's as a child into young adult years - a go-to whenever my parents weren't into the idea of cooking for the family or it was too late to have dinner at a decent hour. Anyway... Friendly and personable guys, and the setting definitely wasn't intimidating. Hahaha... To pass the time, silly boyfriend got me a wine book to check out while we waited for the food. He also got a bit kiddie and drew on the table's paper covering with crayons. Also appreciated the hip hop, rap, R&B playing in the background.  Let's see... Loved the fresh-outta-the-oven pepperoni and sausage pizza. I think the boyfriend mentioned that the sausage was made in-house too. It's the type of pizza you should fold to eat, and you can see the glisten of grease on the top. LOL. Not good as part of a regular diet, but it sure tastes yummy and I would consider a signature of pizza. Also enjoyed their garlic knots, and I pretty much devoured their bistro fries.  Hahaha... If the boyfriend ever wants me to eat pizza with him again, he'd have to agree to go here.",

There is really no reason for any additional toppings or condiments, the pizza stands alone! The sauce is noticeably homemade which is nice considering that many pizza places use a generic sauce. Also ordered garlic knots! So soft, buttery, garlicky, and heavenly!! Definitely one of my favorites! I picked up and the people there were extremely nice! Will be ordering a lot more often!!",

It's tucked right behind a gas station in a residential area. We found this place because we wanted an alternative to the high-priced Grimaldi's.   My family and I like the meatball pizza. In comparison to Verrazanos and New York Pizza (on Jones and Sahara), Bistro proves to be arguably superior. HOWEVER, Grimaldi's is still the best in Vegas imo. I just can't stand paying $35 for a pizza, which is why Bistro gets most of my business when I want a pie.   To sum up my review, Bistro is proving to be the best of Las Vegas and Henderson. For the quality you get in a Bistro pizza, you can't beat the value.   Dont forget to CHECK IN and get your FREE GARLIC KNOTS.",

SERVICE: First off, the big guy who seemed to be the manager on duty was very impersonal; no smile, no enthusiasm and answered our questions in a cold, insensitive manner. This really made our whole experience even more disappointing.  FOOD: The food is over-priced for its portions and low quality. I've never seen a Parmesan cheese so powdery that it truly is just flavored sawdust. The spaghetti with meatballs were watery with just enough sauce to lightly cover the pasta which was again of very poor quality. I ordered 2 extra meatballs for $3 only to find that they are the size of a ping pong ball. I cut into the $10 spinach calzone to find it was mostly air with a bottom layer of ingredients. Again, $10 stromboli was all dough and no meat.  OVERALL: The whole place was dirty and grimy. The dishes and utensils we used had to be wiped off. We ended up ordering soda because the water glasses were layered with grime and fingerprints. The combination of overpricing, very poor quality ingredients, ridiculous portion skimping and cleanliness is disastrous.",

    "text": "Just moved out to Henderson, and was looking for a good pizza spot. This place seemed to have a lot of good reviews, so we decided to give it a try. I called and ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, and was told a 45 minute wait. Okay, I get it, you guys are busy.  I called back about twenty minutes later because I saw the yelp check-in offer for free garlic knots when you check-in. The guy on the phone was like \"uhhhhhhhh are you using it with any other coupons?\" And I said \"No.\" to which he replied, \"yeah you can use it.\" So yay free garlic knots...NOT. I get there and go to the register, one guy is staring at me while cutting pizzas, no acknowledgement, and the other guy definitely saw me as well. Not until an older guy came to the register to order did the second guy finally say, \"be right with you both.\" He finally came over, I told him my name, and he brought the pizza box over to ring it out. I told him that I had a check-in deal from yelp for garlic knots and he said \"oh you have to order a large pizza with one topping to get it.\" I wish the guy I spoke with on the phone told me this! I looked at the receipt after I left, and it said \"free garlic knots\" on it. Wow.  Whatever, so I got home and tried it. It was the most meh pizza I've ever had. It was like cardboard. And I live five minutes from this place so it's not like it got cold by the time I got home. I normally like the crust on pizza but this one was just so bad.  Definitely will not be coming back. *sigh* I miss the pizza back in LA. Oh well, I guess I'll be continuing my search for some good pizza in NV.",

The guy was really cool, the pizza, and a soda, was about $7.95.  Then I ordered the salad.  I should have just ordered the side salad.   I also got a garlic knot for free.  They guy said, I would love there pizza.....Yeah yeah.....Everyone says that!  lol  But guess what I loved the pizza, it had some serious flavor.  I wanted a Pepperoni and black olive, but I got the Pepperoni and Sausage.  No big deal, I'm not allergic to it, I just usually don't like it.  But everything about this pizza was good, the crust was just right.  The sauce had great flavor and seasonings.  It's at the top of my pizza list!  I guess he was right!.  The salad was delicious.   I was so stuffed when I left.  I wasn't expecting that personal pizza to be that big either.  If your in the area, you have to give them a try.",

This place is right outside my neighborhood and I've somehow only been here once as I usually tend to go to another local joint but this last visit may have just changed my mind.  I ordered a large pepperoni with extra cheese, buffalo wings, and garlic knots (which were free with a Yelp check-in).    The pizza was ooey, gooey, and delicious.  The crust had just the right amount of chew to it and the pepperoni just the right amount of spice.  I was a bit blown away when I took my first bite.  It made me really excited to try the wings and garlic knots.  Unfortunately when I tried them, my mood changed a bit.  Upon opening the box, I could tell the wings left much to be desired.  They were cold, barely sauced, and honestly just not that flavorful.  For the amount that you get, they are also on the expensive side.   Now, upon inspection, the garlic knots looked much better than the wings did but I am disappointed to say that they too were quite bland.  For being garlic knots, I barely tasted any garlic.  They were essentially just rolls.  Now, I don't normally order side dishes when getting pizza but I wanted to try Bistro's other offerings.  I'm not saying that the rest of their menu isn't worth ordering, as I haven't tried the rest of it, I'm just saying for me, their pizza is the way to go and something I would gladly return for.",

Temp little high inside for us, but we not from here and it could be us, everything is hot to us. Give this place a try, I think you will be happy.",

I got breaded and soggy :*(   I miss wings from back home that are cooked perfectly, NAKED (no breading) and crispy! Everyone here thinks crispy wings are overcooked for some reason. I have to assume they've only been eating wings from chain pizza places all their lives and that's what they're used to?  IE: Pizza Hut, Papa Johns?

I decided to try something different so I went with a pizza with spinach and mushrooms and of course I couldn't forget the garlic knots. The Pizza was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and the sauce full of flavor. Garlic knots were amazing as always. It reminds me of NYC but without having to go 3,000 miles.   One of the best pizza places I have tried yet. The owner is a very nice guy who is very personable. It is located in a little strip mall off of 215/Gibson. It's kind of hidden you wouldn't really know it's there unless you happen to be driving by. I will definitely be having pizza again the next time I visit or maybe even decide to try another one of the dishes on the menu. I would highly recommend trying this place to anybody who has not yet found this hidden gem.",

The thing that takes this pizza place to the next level is the Poutine they weirdly have on their menu. Two of my favorite things in one place, pizza with good crust and french fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds.   It's just an added bonus that they are a locally owned business.",

I recently found out about this place and it's seriously walking distance from my house! Good and bad being that I probably order every other week.    I'll start with the service. Whether you're calling in an order, or going to there to order, EXPECT EXCELLENT SERVICE, cause that's all they have.  :) Nuff said. I mostly call in my orders and wait impatiently for my food cause it's soo good.  Walk in to the place, and it's not huge.  A few booths along the wall and 1 round table.  They also have a few games to play, or books to read as time passes for your food. Such a warm and cozy family vibe when you walk in.  You can tell there is love flowing through that place.  When I go to pick up my food, there are always people in the booths and they have nothing but smiles.  Families bring their kids, because it is kiddo friendly.    I can honestly say this place has the best pizza.  I eat a lot of pizza, and have had it from different places since birth, and this is one of the best.  The crust is perfect.  Usually I'll leave the crust for someone else to eat, but not here.  If you don't want your crust, slide it over to the left hand side.  I will gladly dip it in some ranch and finish it for you.    One of my favs! Try it out and experience genuine smiles, food made with care and satisfied taste buds.  Can't forget to mention the garlic knots! Those are also scrumptious!",

Tyler I assume the guy behind the cash register was pretty welcoming, he gave us extra cups for the kids, restaurant is clean, they have paper table covers for kids and big kids to doddle, oh and game boards too!  OK, let's get to the food part... we got the WET FRIES, and got demolished! Did I mention that the fries are swimming on a delicious gravy and topped with long stretchy cheese! Yes I definitely recommend this. We got the free garlic knots from yelp, it was really good too. It has that crunchy top and soft middle. My husband ordered the veggie stromboli with chicken, he liked it ok, he wasn't crazy about it but he liked the fresh red peppers and mushrooms. Then I got the lasagne which took a little bit longer to get to our table. I'm almost full when I got it. So I asked them to put it in a to go box. I tried a little, maybe I was too full I didn't really care for it too much.  Over all I like this place, and will come back to try other stuff in their menu.",

This is a disgrace how lazy someone would have to be to give a bad review because YOU'RE lazy.   Now everyone should be aware that the pizza here is pretty decent for a mom and pop pizza shop. I will admit I've had better but that's not why I am giving them 5 stars. The 5 stars is soley due to Tyler. This guys knows customer service. I have been doing retail customer service for 15 years and it's rare to see it at this level. Only will you receive this level of service when you do not use a chain for your pizza.   I placed an order over the phone and when I picked it up, one pizza had spinach when I asked for sausage. Without thinking twice Tyler asked if we had 15 minutes because he wanted to makes is another pizza that was what we ordered. He didn't even give me time to think about being upset or disgruntled over the situation.  Now I know someone reading this is thinking,  \"why didn't they just get it right the first time?\" If that's the case then you should not be eating out. EVER! You can't simply tell me you have always had your order right everytime youve eaten out?? People make mistakes. We are all capable of them. Its how we correct them that sets us apart.   Don't take my word for it. Keep reading more reviews. You will notice he personally responds to any review with 3 stars or less. Your satisfaction is extremely important to him!",

We didn't know we had such a great place so close to us.  We will definitely order from here again & since we know it is also a dine in restaurant we will be dining, not just doing take - out.  Delicious!!!!",

When I agreed to buy the large they said they were out, yet, they continued to sell garlic knots to everyone who came in after me. Not a big deal, but over all the pizza was basic smaller than average size slices.",

Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word. Thanks to Yelp we saved 50% off our pizza order just for checking in today between 2-5pm.",

(Having recently relocated to Henderson, I am still not used to the concept of a non chain, locally owned restaurant located a strip mall.)  2). The 'atmosphere' of the place is emphatically informal. Almost to the point that it almost felt like we were sitting in the kitchen, looking over the shoulder of the staff. 3) The staff was great. Let us take all the time we needed to get familiar with the menu, etc. 4) We had pizza, salads and a pasta dish. All were simply outstanding. Makes my mouth water just writing about the food. And of course the garlic knots-wow.  We will eagerly return to this funky, delicious, and friendly little gem of a an restaurant.",

We were regulars at Grimaldi's for years, but then discovered Pizza Fusion on Eastern near Trader Joes.  Pizza was excellent - fresh with lots of options (e.g. gluten free) - without the grease/oil that I dread from typical pizza joints.  Well, took the family for a ride a couple of weeks ago over to Pizza Fusion only to learn it was gone like a puff of smoke.  We decided tonight would be a great pizza night, but where to go where to go.  After reviewing Yelp we settled on Bistro Pizza.  We ordered the special, two (2) large pizzas with two toppings for $22.50.  We also had chicken wings with hot sauce (8 pieces) for $7.00.    In short, we are very pleased because:  (1) Very good service; (2) Pizza is fresh and tasty (not too much sauce; not too much salt); (3) Toppings are generous; (4) Grease/oil level is within tolerable limits; (5) Wings were tasty, fresh and not dried out nor dripping with margarine/oil; (5)  Price is very reasonable; and (6)  Place is clean  This is not a \"designer\" artsy fartsy pizza kitchen, but that's ok with my family.  This pizza hits the spot and for a family that goes once a month or every other month, we are happy to call this our new pizza place.",

    "text": "Disappointed based on all of the excellent reviews. Perhaps it was an off night for them, I hope so. Atmosphere is basic cold pizza place in a strip mall, super bright fluorescent lights.....which was exactly what we were looking for that night. Several people working behind the counter... my cousin and took a seat at a booth...we had to ask someone how /where to order...and were told after we had decided what we wanted to get up and go back to the front counter to order... that was fine that night but would have been incredibly irritating on a busy night if you had to get up from your table and wait in line behind walk ins or pick ups...meanwhile, our table was literally 3 ft from a \"service\" counter on the side...we could have just talked to the guy behind the counter if he would have allowed it...ok, we did get up and go to the front. The gentleman behind the counter when we went back to order wouldn't / didn't make eye contact with us ( the restaurant was dead when we were there at 6:30 on a Tuesday). The phone rang and counter guy answered the phone, took a pick up order...still not acknowledging us or even glancing our way...after hanging up he went in the back, talks to other staff...comes back out..instead of taking our order proceeds to wipe the prep counters ( with his back to us still)...shuffles a few things around, stirs some fresh prepped veggies, and then seemingly satisfied that there was absolutely nothing else he could do to flat out ignore us turned towards us and said \"yes gentleman, what can I help you with\" ( we were about 30 seconds away from saying screw it and just leaving at that point) um, we would like to order dinner? We order, get charged, he disappears... (we did not order pizza...probably a big mistake) just not in the mood on that night...salads came out in about 10 minutes,  the food came out about 15 minutes later steaming hot and looking really good... a plate of garlic knots was served with our salads...they were excellent, although really oily. The lasagna and baked penny were both meh...kind of bland and strangely unsatisfying. The portions were fairly large. My cousins comment was \"perfectly ok\" ...meaning it was a perfect \"ok\" quality, not something either of us would make the 5 minute drive back for. My cousin asked for a side of bread with his penne, this seemed really confusing to the cook who served the pasta...they finally after a group talk decided they could in fact do \"just garlic bread\" for us... what came out was a small sub roll cut in half with garlic oil baked onto it...again, perfectly ok... 4 /3\" pieces on the plate. We finished and I stopped at the counter to see if there was a charge for the \"just garlic bread\"... well yes there was- $4.30. Seemed like a lot for 6\" of sub roll cut into 4 pieces but at that point we just needed to leave. We both really wanted this to be a new regular spot. We won't be back.",

We took the kids this time.   This place is pretty close to home which is even better.  Its a small place but those tend to be the best places. The owner greeted us and was making pizzas at the same time.   This place is very kid friendly. The give them a big piece of butcher paper and the kids can draw. Its a great distraction for us parents! The owner also lets them hang their artwork on the wall.  They GF was very happy  because they had gluten free pizza too! Its pretty rare and a great treat for her.   We got a few big pizzas for everyone to share and an order of their famous garlic knots.   The kids watched their pizzas being made and loved it. They pizza maker tosses the pizza in the air old school style. It really is an art form. I wish I could do that!  The pizza was delicious and kid approved too. The crust had great texture and was perfectly cooked.  The gluten free pizza was pretty good too. It didn't have the rubbery texture most of them have.   The garlic knots, OMG they were AH MAZ ING! They are the best I have ever had. I had to tell the GF they were terrible and I choked on them since she is gluten free. SHHHH!  All in all, it was a great visit. We will be back again for sure.",

They welcomed us into the restaurant, and made our dinner. We ate in Bistro tonight and the Staff was polite, service was awesome, and didn't rush us out. I love this little local place and we eat her often. They never disappoint!!! Bistro is a must add to your list!!  We LOVE this place!! We eat at Bistro weekly and we're never disappointed!  My family loves the garlic knots, bistro sliders, bistro salad, pizza and the lasagna rocks!!! I used them for catering last Feb and everyone raved about the food!!! We can't get enough of this place!! It's nice to have great quality food and service in our backyard!!!!",

The garlic knots are really good, perfect blend of cheese and garlic and cooked perfectly until just done.   We ordered a large sausage, mushroom and peppers. The toppings and cheese were plentiful and all tasted high quality. The crust was really good, thin and crispy. Definately one of the better pizza's I have had in Vegas. Bistro also has a full italian menu and a nice sit down area if you choose to dine in. The meatball sliders look awesome, will have to try on my next visit!",

This is by far one of top 5 pizza joints we've been too. Ever since coming here, we made it necessary to try more local pizza joints rather than chain pizza places. The service is always so great. I wish we remembered their names - but there is a big funny guy, a dude with dreads and a girl with a pixie hair cut who ALWAYS make our visit so special. We've been there at LEAST 10 times now and will continue to eat there. We've tried a handful of menu items and recommend the ghost pepper fries as a great appetizer. You have to give this pizza joint a shot- you WONT regret it. Crunchy but flavorful crust, just enough cheese and toppings to give a taste of everything on the pizza, and the marinara is amazing and homemade!",

And a lot of people seem to love them, so try them out and decide for yourself! The pizza crust is delicious and they are not stingy with the cheese at all.  And they have gluten free options which is nice of them.  I love supporting small businesses so will return whenever in the area and craving pizza.

Backup options to bring/recommend to a tourist   3 is good. Someplace I would return to if in the area.

    "text": "\"Will Work For Food\" read the sign of the guy I found to help with some top to bottom house cleaning.  OK, maybe not.  But I do have a friend who has been helping out.  He actually is willing to work for some pizza and a Dr. Pepper.  As payment, I brought him to Bistro Pizza.  I saw the strong Yelp reviews as well as the offer for free order of garlic knots with a Yelp check-in.  It was on at that point.  This is some good pizza made with quality fresh ingredients.  Each pizza is made to order and 100% customizeable.  There are no cookie cutter prefab options here.  We ordered a large pizza with sausage, green bell pepper, mushroom and olives.  Plus the garlic knots with my check-in, of course.    The knots were out first.  They were still slightly doughy inside which we both agreed was perfect.  They were buttery and slightly garlicy.  The big punch of garlic came from the chunks of fresh garlic in the marinara.  Everything about it was great.  And to make it better, there were six knots of comparible size.  Each of us got 3 and neither felt cheated.  When the pizza arrived a few minutes later and shortly after finishing our knots, I was shocked by how heavy handed this place is on the toppings.  It was nearly impossible to eat this pizza with out a fork and knife.  The full coverage of cheese.  The fresh mushrooms and bell peppers.  The ground mild Italian sausage.  All of it was perfect and not skimpy in the least.  There were so many toppings I was starting to feel full after just 2 slices.  I ended up taking a couple of slices home. I had some family come in from out of town later that day and they enjoyed a slice.  I had the final slice a day later.  It was just as good reheated.  The overall feel of Bistro Pizza is not one of high class.  This is a little pizza joint that doesn't pretend to be anything more.  There is paper and crayons on each table for some simple entertainment as you wait for your food.  The walls along the counter and pizza making station are lined with drawings from past customers.  You really get the impression that the staff here care for their customers.  They display their art work and they joke around with you.  It feels like old friends just hanging out when you come in here.  I will be back for my pizza fix again.",

Tyler wasn't there...not a good sign  younger kitchen staff...not really operating like a kitchen staff...need I say more?  We ordered the same thing as last time-Half White with mushrooms and basil, and half Salami, pepperoni, and pineapple. The lady taking our order rings us up, and while waiting, the kitchen is open to everything going on...EVERYTHING  Same lady with another worker picks up the rubber mats that they all step on, brings it towards the back, comes back and rings up a gentleman's to-go order, and then washes her hands-not long enough by health standards...then proceeds to make our pie...no bueno  The pizza dough was less crisp this time, and not as thin and flavorful as when Tyler made it. we didn't finish our pie...  Seeing all the raves about the Garlic Knots, we take advantage of the yelp check-in for a free order, and what a waste, because after the first bite, I was done. Why? because the \"buttery\" flavor isn't butter, it's Whirl (remember, this is an open kitchen)...a cheaper, longer lasting, nasty butter alternative that is just as bad, if not worse than margarine, Country Crock, etc. There's no better substitute for real  butter! Now do you wanna use your Yelp Check in offer????  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  2",

You get to experience a real sense of community here and eat delicious pizza and them evil garlic knots!  I was hesitant to write that not so favorable update two months ago, but it was out of concern for BP's business.  Thanks to Tyler for replying back to me and addressing those issues.  I even got a text message from a friend whose on Yelp who told me to please let the owner know when she came to visit, that the employees were friendly and not goofing off. So noted.  Fast forward two months and couple ninja check in visits, BP crew rocks!  Proud of some of these young adults who not only have good work ethics, but a promising future in the culinary industry.   So catching up on the food aspect of this review, love the new (to me at least) specials, like that Chicken Angelo and stuffed shells! Good comfort food.  The side meatballs and garlic knots still taste great to me! Not sure what those latest two reviewers are talking about, then again I dont have that refined palate, can't tell real butter from \"Whirl\",  nor neither do I work in a \"professional restaurant \"  ....((Face Palm and Rolls Eyes))...  ICYMI on Yelp app - Yelp Tip - see their website for web specials! That's why I try to make it here on Sundays, gotta swing by and pick up that pizza deal for Mr. B!",

We almost always want delivery when we decide to order a pizza, and every single time we have tried to get a pizza delivered from Bistro they have not had a driver available.   I was out running errands on a Sunday when my husband requested that I bring home a veggie pizza. He suggested I get it from Bistro since I was going to be in that area. I called in the order, and in hindsight I should have asked for pricing to avoid the sticker shock that ensued later...   At Bistro there is no such thing as a veggie pizza, you just pick a size (large is $15) and then add your toppings ($1.75 each). Bistro does have a lot of toppings to choose from, and it's probably partially my fault we ended up with a pizza that neither of us cared all that much for.. I ended up with a $30+ dollar pizza with so many toppings, it was difficult to taste any cheese or sauce.   The crust was excellent, I'll go back to Bistro for a plain cheese pizza or perhaps a pie with just 1-2 toppings. And 5 stars for the garlic knots. Those things are delish, and getting them for free thanks to the Yelp check-in offer only makes them better.",

Went in and its a small local pizza shop look. The place smelled good. We sat in front of the cooking area where we could see them cheffing it up. The menu is simple and wasn't sure what to expect because the place looks less than unassuming. We ordered a couple pizzas which were fantastic and the toppings looked hand cut. The pie and crust and sauce were cooked perfectly and tasted perfect and  tasted fantastic. Garlic knots were huge, hot and you really could taste the garlic and light cheese topping with marinara. You gotta try them. We ended up taking some home as we ordered a bunch to try it out. The calzone was gourmet style and they'll ale it anyway you want. Salad was fresh topped as you'd get in a very nice restaurant and topped with a great balsamic dressing. Perfect.  They cook was more like a chef that bought a pizza place. The food quality and taste was  one of the best ever for a pizza experience.   Price was very reasonable for what you get. The cook/chef turned out to be the owner and very personable and friendly.   Highly recommended to give them a shot. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised. I'll be back for sure.",

We had ordered through BiteSquad and they were out of one of the calzone fillings we wanted. Since they couldn't get a hold of us immediately, they put in the calzone without the missing filling and started it anyway, just in case we were in a hurry. When I got there to pick it up, they told me about the issue and offered to make us a new one with a different filling if I was willing to wait, which I was. They gave us the first calzone as well anyway, because they would have had to throw it out anyway. THAT kind of customer service and considerate thinking is what'll make me come back here again and again and again.",

    "text": "I wanted some bad carbs so we decided to try out Bistro pizza based on the high ratings.  When we arrived, the shop was kinda stuffy.  We placed an order of garlic knots and an order of hot wings to go.  While we were waiting for our order, we sat in a table close to the front, enjoying a short game of scrabble.  I liked the fact that the table cover was made of white paper, so that we can jot down our score.  While we were engaged in the game, a cricket caught my attention.  He was making his way across the floor.  EEK.  Good thing we are not eating there.  Our order was done and we quickly got home in 5 mins.  Unfortunately, the garlic knots did not taste as buttery and garlicky as I had wanted them to, and the hot wings were lightly battered, which we liked, but not crispy as we have liked them to be as well.    My conclusion is that I probably did not order what they are popular for?  Either way, I will try again and order a pizza next time.  But for now, it's a Meh.  Because I have eaten better garlic knots and wings.",

The pizza was great quality made to order, dough is hand tossed in the small prep area next to the dining room. Toppings were high quality and fresh. Great for families especially with kids. Tables have paper down for drawing with crayons and they have a selection of board games for while you wait/dine. Currently they have a check-in special for a free order of garlic knots with a purchase of large pizza. I was expecting a small side order but they provide you with their full order of knots which were great. The only thing I disliked is that the crust of the pizza was a little thick although it was cooked all the way through. I might see of they have a thin crust option next time. Overall great experience, good quality fresh pizza and good atmosphere!",

The Calzone has SOOOO SOGGY (a 1/4 cup of juice I retained from it, saved it too, cause I was going to march right back up there to show the manager)  I did not, instead I called, he was quite \"matter of fact\" in his defense of this shabby meal I paid over $54 for!  I said I only tried this place BECAUSE OF THE GOOD YELP REVIEWS. And with this meal, I would have to be honest and write a bad one. HE DID NOT CARE WHAT SO EVER!!!! His exact words were \"GO AHEAD\"  After a back and forth argument he did say he would give me A  free pizza or make it right the next time I come in. BIG DEAL after  paying for delivery, and trying to convey my CLEARLY poor meal to him over the phone, (i even offered to text or e-mail pictures of this slop I had of a meal on my table, not interested) I do NOT want any of your FREE FOOD! I just want to maybe help someone else from wasting their money! I guess if I owned a business I would ask all my friends to write five star reviews also.",

Location: This pizza joint is tuck away in a little strip mall off the 215 and Gibson. Very easy to find and easy to get to.  2. Service: It's a one man operation, just the owner. He takes your order and cooks it up right in front of you. He also serves and rings you up too. Great guy!  3. Food: Food quality is great! I ordered the spin zone calzone which was amazing. It was sauteed with fresh spinach and garlic, ricotta and mozzarella. When it arrived it was HUGE, fresh, and delicious. The homemade marinara sauce, YUM! I loved the fresh chopped garlic.  My boys ordered garlic knots, which was made fresh and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza sauce is simple perfection.   4. Nice touch: I also like the paper table cloth. He has crayons on the tables so you can draw while you wait. It helps to pass time especially with kids. The owner also picks drawings and hangs them up on his counter. Nice little touch.  *tip: if you check-in with yelp you get a discount on a one topping large.  It's a GREAT neighborhood pizza joint. You'll be thankful you found this place. I give him a 5 out of 5 stars. Excellent! This place came highly recommended to me and everyone I've recommended absolutely loved it!",

It normally comes with angel hair pasta but I subbed the whole wheat penne instead.  All the ingredients complimented each other...man it was good!

    "text": "I'm not a yelper. Which is funny because I am so opionated; additionally, I'm always out and about trying everything once. Nonetheless, sometimes, just sometimes, I feel compelled to write a review.  Today is one of those times.  I love Bistro Pizza. It's simple, it's descent and it's close to home.   Let me break down my rating which is more a 3.5 than a 4:  Food- Their pizza is descent. It's not the best but it will do. That being said.... The pizza sauce is good. Generally speaking, the ingredients used, across the board, are quality. There's room for improvement with their knots, house fries and chicken wings/fingers - they are handled with a sense of obligation in that they really only serve them because they are a pizza joint and it's expected. However, their pasta dishes are legit. Delicious for the most part. Seriously eat the pasta. Especially if it's a daily special.   Service- I am guessing they are under new mgmt. The last two times I've been here the only owner known to me (the Alton Brown look alike) hasn't been there. Seems odd since I've never not seen him there in the past years+. Anyhow, the guy who I am assuming is Tyler (dark goatee in a ball cap) appears to be the new owner or manager. He knows his customers well and treats everyone like guests in his home. He's definitely got a lock on how to run the \"kitchen\" and you can tell he cares about his employees because you can hear him giving kudos left and right.   That being said... It's got a rather fraternal feel to it now. It's like if your older, cooler brother invited a few friends over and was like \"Dude let's cook stuff and sell it\" and they agreed. So service is spotty if you're eating in and Tyler isn't up front. Also, if you're dining in, don't be surprised if you have to ask for stuff multiple times and inquire about the rest of your order if they get busy while you are there. It can get a little tense when you can see (and hear) all that's going on.   We just left the restaurant about an hour ago. And I can't close this review out without bringing up Lavelle (sp?) I believe another reviewer mentioned him a few reviews ago. He is the reason for my review ultimately. He could probably run the bistro by himself.   During our dinner I can't count how many times I heard the manager or another employee bellowing for his assistance. And everytime there he was whisking from one task to the next without hesitation. Despite his workload I saw him go out of his way to keep an eye on the diners and their needs. Our table included. I really hope he is shown the appreciation he is due.    So...long review short. Good place. Give it a try. I keep going back and likely will again.  Ps. It's always hot in there regardless of the season but you get use to it.",

    "text": "Don't let the half-empty strip mall location be a deterrent. We decided to try Bistro Pizza after the rave reviews from Shirley B. on facebook and yelp. And wow, are we glad we did!  The Garlic Knots are a must-have. At $5 for 6 knots, it's a steal. My young sons would have been happy to have made a meal out of just those. But thankfully they saved room for pizza. As my 9-year-old declared, \"Mom this is MUCH better pizza than (insert another local pizza joint we often frequent which has MUCH higher prices)!\"  The owner was friendly, gracious and welcoming. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was they currently don't serve alcohol and I enjoy a frosty libation with my pizza! But we will be back again and often!",

    "text": "SO GOOD. stopped by this place totally based on yelp reviews during a trip to Vegas, after driving back from the Hoover Dam. It was so great, we talked about it all weekend and ended up picking up a pizza to go before heading to the airport! Garlic knots are incredible. Calzone is huge. White pizza was so, so good. Between several of us, we sampled many entrees and appetizers and everything was fantastic. We've told all our friends and sent them to Bistro Pizza when they visit Vegas. You won't regret the detour from the Strip.",
