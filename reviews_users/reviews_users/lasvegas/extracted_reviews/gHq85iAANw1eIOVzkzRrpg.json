My friend had the chicken and waffles and she loved it. That was recommended by a friend. I tasted the pancakes that came with one of the meals and they were very good. For lunch today, I got the French dip. It was alright. I wouldn't order it again. My friends got the monte Cristo and the meatloaf that was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives. I tasted it. Pretty good, but not amazing. They loved the monte cristo. It is a deep fried sandwich with powdered sugar and preserves to dip in. The service was o.k. Both times, but I'm from the land of customer service (Orlando) so, I'm used to amazing service. Maybe it's considered good for this area. Anyway, I would come back. The missing star is probably for the lackadaisical service. They're friendly enough, but just not quite as attentive as I'm used to. They still got over 20%, so it wasn't terrible. I would go back. Especially for the coffee and Benedict.",

I would have loved some strawberry syrup though, just maple here. My boyfriend got a burger and said the bread on the top of the burger was different from the bottom, I didn't try it but my guess is the grease made the bread a little more mushy. He said the fries were average, and nothing special. The waitress advised him to not get the Mac and cheese because she said it resembled boxed Mac and cheese. Maybe they need a little bit of help when it comes to the sides. We will be back at a later date, if we go to that area. But nothing I'll be craving or driving that far for. Prices were average too. Was $25 for two meals.",

You can tell that everybody from the greeters to the servers to the kitchen to the bussers to the management are motivated, display urgency, and show that they understand and care that the customers coming in are the lifeblood of the business.  The food is excellent for a self-proclaimed \"diner\" - you can get your breakfast classics, varied specials, as well as their own custom concoctions (Charleston Shrimp & Grits, Holy Davoli burger, etc.).  Check out their menu online if you're curious.  My fave right now is still the corned beef hash breakfast.  They roast the corned beef there themselves, and it's just fantastic - savory, juicy, everything it should be.  Anyway, you should go.  Seriously, just do yourself a favor and do it.  You won't be disappointed.  Not because I can read your mind, but because they truly care about what they do there and will make sure you love it.",

The quality, not so good: i had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. The eggs, hash browns and biscuits were average to good diner food. The gravy was bland, like they made a country gravy and added cooked sausage to it. Although there was lots of sausage, the predominant flavors were milk and flour. I know it's healthier, but without sausage grease, it lost its flavor.   My wife had the San Francisco Benedict. Again, the English muffin, the egg, the Canadian bacon and avocado all average to good diner food. The Hollandaise sauce was seriously disappointing, lacking a decent lemon flavor, with an off color. I don't expect most restaurants to make a True Hollandaise, especially at these prices, but they can do better than an off colored, oil flavored substitute.",

Our waiter was Dario (not sure how to spell) and he was very friendly and asked us about our day, and complimented our novelty t shirts. He also educated us on the custom drinks and specials of the day and how their menu works. He was able to describe every ingredient of the items and was very enthusiastic about the chicken & waffles and corned beef & hash.   When you first walk in it seems like a long wait for a small place but they definitely surprised us.   My boyfriend got the Holy Davoli burger which is a burger smashed between two grilled cheeses with bacon and lettuce slaw. - very unique   It was pretty inexpensive for good food too. Our waiter was also not the only nice one, they were all nice from the conversations I could hear other waitress' having.   Will for sure be back again.",

If you are a big cream cheese lover then its for you. Made me wanna vomit after eating half a roll.

The shrimp and grits are great, as are the chicken and waffles (but I feel like you get the whole chicken, it was the biggest plate of chicken and waffles I've ever seen).  The staff is also super friendly and attentive. Even on weekend mornings when it's slammed you are well taken care of.  The only negative is the parking fills up and can be very difficult- but that's not really their fault so I can't hold it against the diner.",

I have been here over 10 times and not once have they disappointed.  The food is delicious, the service is outstanding, the prices are more than reasonable.  The location is easily accessible and in a good area.  From the chicken and waffles, to their salads, to their huge variety of breakfast items that are all amazing, you cannot go wrong.  It is family friendly. They really are all about great customer service.  I will say that, as a local, I have been to the strip a lot for breakfast and brunch. Metro diner makes all these places look average! Very highly recommended.",

    "text": "This place has its pros and cons.    First of all, service here is superb.  The server never left us with empty cups and the manager even touched tables which I believe its important.    We ordered the shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles.  It came out fast, maybe around 10 minutes.   The portions are huge!! Price is around $15 for entrees.  So presentation was beautiful.  The chicken was crispy and so were the waffles.  It comes with a hot sauce syrup that the server makes to order in front of you.  I suggest you try tobasco with syrup instead.  I liked that combo! The waffle also comes with a strawberry butter which was tasty.  The chicken was nice and crispy but i think the fryer oil needed a change because it was dark and i could taste the difference.  I used to fry chicken everyday at work and I know when the oil is bad.  But it was good!  The shrimp and grits were also delicious.  The grits are not the loose kind, its actually a grits cake.  The shrimp was not rubbery at all.    We spent a total of $40 for our meals with drinks.  We will be returning for french toast and crab cakes next time.",

My kids had to tell me a few times the server was rude to me. I was staying positive and trying to enjoy. All seemed ok but there was a strange vibe. Ordered burger, club, waffle, pancakes and 2 kids chicken meals. I ordered the unsweetened tea and did not drink much of it. Tasted as if the tea was filtered in a coffee pot and tasted like coffee. I asked server is the tea could we returned for credit.  My daughter said the server walked to back-and that could see a manager say 'F- him and it looked towards us. Overall it was poor choice for us and doubt we will return.",

Now I've never been a waitress or should I say hostess, but we were a party of 2 and there was a single guy there.  Wouldn't it be better if he got a table that was for 2 and the party of 2 get the table that was for 4?  Because our table had so many plates on it, we had to be careful not to tip anything over.  JS!  I got the chicken and waffles, you get 1 leg 1 wing, 1 breast and 1 thigh!  No I didn't eat it all, I shared 1/2 of my chicken with  my husband.  I also ordered hash browns and eggs on the side.  When you order the checken and waffles, Our waitress Ashley, came over and poured some syrup in a bowl, (I was thinking!  Wow there stingy with the syrup) but then she put some hot sauce in with the syrup....I'm thinking what the heck is she doing!  It's something to dip your chicken in. I kinda'sorta liked it.  The hash browns were ok the eggs were good.  And I was stuffed!  My husband got the croissant french toast!  I didn't care for it, but I don't care for french toast.   He liked it.   So our bill was pretty hefty for a breakfast!  like $49.00.  Ashley was a great waitress, she made sure we had everything we needed, and her skills were on point.  I will be back.  They had other things on the menu I would like to try!",

    "text": "Ok... So for us SouthWest Las Vegans, New dining outlets are a treat. ( Please put some more places in Mountains Edge)  I have already been to Metro Diner 3 times in the short time that they have been open. They are doing a very good thing so far.  First time was The Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and the Reuben. Pork sandwich was very good. Reuben flavor was good but was frankly a little thinner than I am used to ( Thats what I get for going to Jasons Deli previously).  The Second time we went for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised,  We had a great meal with Crab Benedict and the Corned Beef Hash. Crab cakes were pretty good, but in context with the meal they were very nice. English Muffin was a little too hard, though. Corned Beef hash was excellent and eggs perfectly poached. We even got the Bananas Foster Cheesecake which was fantastic.   The third visit, we figured we needed to get what they have on a lot of their signs and we got the chicken. I got Chicken and Waffles and my wife got the Chicken Dinner. Both were amazing. Chicken brined and marinated and perfectly cooked. The breast wasn't dried out and the breading was flavorful. Strawberry butter on the waffles was fantastic.   A gentleman came by and asked how our meal was and we told him how much we enjoyed the food and service. My wife asked what he did there and he politely replied.. \" Well, Im the owner\". THAT is impressive. The fact that Nick came by and was checking with tables himself says everything about this place. Please, please keep that part up, guys. Guests appreciate it.   The service was great all three times. We loved Jennifer and Maria ( sorry but I missed the other two ladies names that served us, but they were great too).   Welcome to the Neighborhood, Metro Diner. We will see you soon. ( ok, Tomorrow.... :-)  )",

Super impressed! As a mom w/ a young child, nothing is more difficult than going out to eat and highchairs being unavailable or servers who very clearly \"hate\" children. Our server, Alexa (I believe her name was), was incredible! Not only was she super attentive to our table, she was also extremely considerate of my child-- when asking what beverage for my child, I said apple juice and before I could even request, she said \"half apple juice, half water\"  Best server ever! The food was amazing, so fresh and everything was warm. Their coffee of the day, Bavarian Chocolate, very tasty! Overall, it was fantastic! I definitely recommend this place to anyone.",

With all the construction around the area it was a bit annoying to get in the plaza as the only entrance was east bound on warm springs. I ordered the huevos rancheros, but didn't like it too much, but i think it's just my taste buds because it looked good lol. And girlfriend of course got a crab Benedict. She didn't like it as much as the others she's had tho. We ordered coffee which it their house blend and it was surprisingly tasty compared to most breakfast coffees we had. The diner is nice and the staff is friendly as well. Will have to go again and try something else and adjust review accordingly!",

My friend and I paid our bill, he paid cash and left a tip and I used my debit card, we got our receipt and left. A week later I saw an extra charge of $10 that was debited to my acct from Metro Diner. I called Metro Diner and spoke to the manager Darla. She was super nice. I asked about the extra $10 that was debited to my card and she pulled up the receipt from the day when my friend and I was there. We found that the waitress who had served us that day, wrote on the receipt a tip of $10 and swiped my card. Darla was very helpful and had the money put back in my acct. She said I going to hear from Tony regarding this incident but I have yet to hear from him. THE FOOD WAS GREAT. but am just sad that the waitress swiped my card, without my authorization for an extra tip after my friend had already left her a tip in cash",

    "text": "METRO DINER YES! I went about a week ago, party of two on a Saturday afternoon! This place was popping! There was a short wait about 10 mins but it wasn't a big deal, we got seated and our drink order was taken efficiently. The hostess explained the run down, they have a black board with daily specials that change each day from featured menu items to drink options.   Their menu is actually quite the expansive one! There was so many choices it kinda gets hard to choose what you want!   Our server was nice and helped us through the menu, what their more popular items are and since we were seated in an area that wasn't visible to the blackboard he told us what the featured items were.   We took a minute or two to figure out what we wanted. We finally decided on ordering chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy and the corned beef hash with poached eggs.   Though the place was busy, our server was attentive and he had great customer service! He was easy to talk to and was funny!   It did take a while to get our food which would be the only down side to our experience but I have to say it was worth the wait!!   Once our food arrived our server checked on us and made sure everything was good. I loved that the manager made an effort to go to each table to ensure their experience was to the best of their ability!   Customer service, food quality and overall experience was excellent! The wait time from ordering to receiving food could use some work but you can't rush good food!",

They were busy, almost every table had someone at it. Our waiter came over and told us about the specials, and took our drink order. While we were waiting for our drinks and looking at the menu, two more people came to check on us. (And we might have waited 2 mins for our drinks... not long at all!) I hope the wait staff keeps that up, because not a lot of places give that kind of attention anymore! My friend got a soup and sandwich meal and I got a burger with mac and cheese. Everything was good! Fast, friendly, and good quality! I'll definitely be back!",

There is going to be a wait during the weekends so be sure to come early.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious but I narrowed it down to two items to try. I ended up ordering the fried chicken and waffles and croissant french toast.   Fried chicken and waffles come with hot maple syrup. The server brings it over and adds a little Louisiana hot sauce to it. The mixture paired well with the chicken and the waffles. The waffles were super soft and crispy on the edges. I do not think I have ever had waffles this spectacular before. The chicken was moist and fried to perfection.   The croissant french toast was buttery and fluffy. It is not like any other french toast I have had before. It had a chewiness to it as well and you do not need to add much maple syrup to it as well.   Our server was attentive but messed up my coffee order. I wanted regular coffee but she brought over hazelnut instead. The coffee tasted great so I did not mention it to her. Once I was done with my coffee, she brought over a refill as well. Prices are fair and portions are large. There might be trouble finding parking since they share it with other businesses but I was lucky enough to catch someone leaving.",

I can't even count how many of the servers, as well as the manager, checked on us over and over again to make sure we were doing ok.

We were seated promptly, had great service, and no complaints about the food. I had the Croissant French Toast and an excellent side of bacon.   The bathroom was also in good condition, though it's a one-seater!  Keeping the Metro Diner from five stars is unfortunately the other customers... the servers said nothing about the party in the middle of the dining room who were blasting videos on their cell phones. It really detracted from the dining experience.",

    "text": "I came here with a party of 4. It was pretty busy and the hostess took our names without telling us the wait time which I found unusual. We took a seat on the waiting bench and proceeded to wait about 20 minutes. When a server came up and asked the hostess if any four tops were waiting for a table, the hostess said there wasn't and proceeded to seat a three top table who got there only two minutes prior. We then proceeded to confront the hostess, since we were sitting not even half a foot from her, and asked her why we weren't sat since we were a party of four who specifically requested a table. She asked in a snarky tone, \"oh, are you Dot?\" So she clearly knew we were waiting and then unsincerely said \"oh I'm sorry\" and went back to seating other guests.  Once we finally made it to our table and ordered about 40 minutes later, we got our food without silverware. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but considering the complete lack of attentiveness from the hostess and the wait time it was annoying. Our server was fine, he was polite enough. The food was good too and came out in a reasonable amount of time. We waited far longer to be seated than we waited to order and eat our food.  In general I'd come back, but if I saw that hostess I'd about face and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "This restaurant was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners,Drive-Ins and Dives. Gave it a try and gave something a try that wasn't on a \"Special Menu\". I was beyond amazed by the non-greasy croissant French Toast and topped it with fresh strawberries & granola. The server recommended the strawberry butter and boy the flavors just exploded! I loved my plate so much that I ate the whole thing! Lol! A lot of the servers even stopped by our table to complement on the concoction I ordered and a few of them also said \"I'm gonna have to try that\" and \"I would have never thought to make that and it looks so delicious\".  My husband ordered the house chicken and waffles. Boy that chicken was so tasty and full of flavor. Served really piping hot (so be careful). The server explains that it comes with spicy syrup and they come table side service to mix it in front of you (maple syrup with 7 drops or so) of hot sauce. Now that's a full of umami explosion party in the mouth!  The host and servers were very friendly. Except for that one girl that worked the front while we were on our way out. One guy acknowledged us for \"how was everything\" \"have a great day\".  Then there was this one girl that just thinks great customer service doesn't leave a good impression once the customer leaves.  I overheard her commenting to her co-workers \"you all sound like a broken record.\" This girl was the same one that didn't even acknowledge us or even say good morning when we walked into the door. Sorry but not sorry...this girl being stationed as a host should not be in the front where the first and last customer interaction is at. All in all the majority of the friendly staff outweighed this one girl.  Thank you Guy Fieri and Metro Diner!!!! We'll be back again.",

I had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits. It came with 2 grits cakes instead of traditional grits but they were full of flavor. They were in a plate full of gravy, andouille sausage and shrimp. Wish there was a bit more shrimp, and maybe a little less gravy but other than that it was fantastic. I also had mango sweetened tea, very tasty and refreshing! It is pretty loud in there and I felt like the stay was trying to rush us a bit when we stayed to chat awhile after our meal. They were friendly but definitely got the feeling they were needing the table. Great new addition to the Southwest area! Will definitely be back!",

I looked up reviews & ordered some of the stuff that was recommended. Let me start with I would've given more stars if I could've actually enjoyed the other half of my food. I ordered the biscuits & gravy with a side of sausage patties which came with eggs & home fries. They dropped off my food & my gravy was almost cold & being that it was house made gravy I expected it to taste better than that. The server was really nice  & took it back for new one. A man that looked like a manager brought it back out nice & hot , but the gravy just wasn't that good. The sausage patties that cost about 5 bucks for 2 pieces tasted like it was cooked yesterday or something? Not good either. The home fry potatoes on the side tasted like they fry a bunch of it & have it under a lamp or something & throw them on a plate per order. I think I just made a bad decision on my order.   Ok...what made me still want to come back & maybe try other items on the menu is the nice staff & the CHICKEN & WAFFLES! I never thought I'd like it cause I didn't like the whole concept of chicken dipped in syrup, but throw some Louisiana hot sauce in the syrup & it was so good. Sweet, savory,salty, with a lil kick. The waffles came with their house made strawberry butter which was delicious. I didn't even use the syrup with the waffles. The strawberry butter was enough. A must try item for sure.   We'll be back some day to try something else on the menu but definitely not the biscuits & gravy.",

The Trop location suddenly closed a few weeks ago and a sign on the door read \"Closed for relocation\" and some notes about opening up later in the year in a new location to better serve the Las Vegas community.  Businesses open and close all the time so whatever just a little amazed the location didn't make it to its 1st anniversary.  Well I had a hankering for Metro so drove to the Rainbow location.  Service great as always, but the food was not up to the standard I was used to at the Trop location.  Corned beef hash was dry, like so dry the corned beef was crumbly and really fine in texture, and the poached eggs were over poached.  Nothing worse than dry CBH with over cooked eggs to boot.  Probably just a one off experience and I'll ultimately give this location another shot, but unfortunately since this location is twice as far from my place as the Tropicana location I won't be a regular here.",

The chicken was a perfect crisp and sooo juicy! You can tell that it came straight from the fryer too! The homemade mashed potatoes and gravy  were a delight so was the homemade biscuit. I didn't really care for the Mac n cheese. I was actually dissatisfied with it. It was not oven baked and it tasted like it came from a box. Surprised too since everything else was from scratch. My husband had the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter! There was actually fresh strawberries in there...yummmm! I totally recommend and will be back when i visit Vegas!",

The hot sauce and pancake syrup is the best combination that goes with that dish 3. Chicken tenders with their honey mustard is amazing.  4. Monte cristo 5. Philly cheese steak  6. Chicken pot pie 7. Burgers --ehh hit or miss 8. Grits & Mac and cheese A MUST TRY  Desserts- ALL OF THE COBBLERS are perfect.    The managers are extremely polite. They come over to make sure everything is good. The servers are great they always come back to see if you need anything else and are always making sure to ask if you need a drink refill.  This place is great to eat at. Only problem is when you go there often it's the same old boring menu once you have almost gone through half of it. But there's always specials you can try if you like and the waiter will let you know what they are once you sit down.",

I ordered breakfast (eggs, avo toast and  hashbrowns works with NO MEAT) Told the waitress it was our first time, she had some recommendations. Food didn't take too long to come out.  Food tasted fine until I began eating my hashbrowns and seen a piece of bacon (size of a quarter on my plate. Right then I had 2 tiny pieces of bacon in my mouth that I immediately spit out into my napkin.  My fiance was heated. He's the one that told them No Meat when I ordered my food. When he attentoned the waitress she was apologetic the store manager said he just got there and basically in so many words..they're not responsible what the cooks make. I was not in the mood to go back and forth I was stuck on how its been almost 10 years since I had a piece of pork and how my fiance stressed to them No Meat.  They comp my food but I will never go back to that place again. Really disappointed how they handled with excuses.",

What's crazy is it was a lot better as a leftover cause all the flavors had time to sync in with each other.

The menu is laid out in a very simple-to-understand fashion and shows *in green* what the most popular items are. Prices are very fair. I had a \"favorite\"--the corned beef hash with poached eggs and a biscuit. My friend had the french toast special that was listed on the specials board this morning (not sure how often the specials change, but today is 09/15/17), and we both had the \"special\" hazelnut flavored coffee.   Everything was DELICIOUS (I tried some of my friend's french toast, too). The coffee was amazing (why can't I ever seem to achieve diner-style coffee at home?? They make it look so easy), the service was impeccable and the entire experience from entry to exit was wonderful. Everyone was friendly and made sure that our dining was top-notch.  My ooooooooooonly problem (and it wasn't huge, seeing as I didn't even bring it to management's attention) was that my food arrived kinda... cold? Not freezing. Not undercooked. Just... not as warm as I expected it to be when first coming to the table (and I mean, I dug in pretty quickly). The corned beef tasted great! But because it was slightly room temp, it took a little bit of the enjoyment out of it. And the biscuit most certainly wouldn't have melted butter if I had put some on it--just as a reference for how \"not hot\" my food was.  I will be back, there's no doubt about that. I love the atmosphere and look forward to trying different things on the menu, too.",

I have to  be honest, I gave this place an extra star because of the server we had, Tim :) He was such a cool guy and anyone that loves brunch more so than breakfast and hates runny  eggs is A-ok in my  book. Aside from that everyone here was very  attentive from the bus boys to the manager himself.    The place is always busy, but the service is fast and  food comes out hot. I had the huevos rancheros plate (about $10)  which could of fed a small family and my  friend had the corned beef hash (also  around $10). My food was very  yummy and his seemed to  be good as well, but the beef in the corned beef was the minced kind (like hamburger) and  not the shredded  corned  beef which I preferred. They had a number of specials on the board to  choose from as well and everyone was very helpful with their  suggestions or offering  substitutions when appropriate.   I would definitely come back here!  Oh oh wait....they  also had french vanilla flavored coffee and it was SO GOOD!",

First time I had the meat loaf, mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.   The meat loaf was on point with proper seasoning and good texture.   It was covered in a brown gravy that was a perfect compliment. The mashed potatoes were creamy and real.    My second trip I ordered the fried chicken platter. 4 pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, veggies and a biscuit.  It was a huge amount of tasty food.  Ended up taking a couple of pieces of chicken home.  The wife ordered the chicken pot pie.  IT WAS FREAKING HUGE!  It was full of goodness and she enjoyed a good chunk of it before she was full.     I will darken the door of Metro Diner again!",

The wait was pretty long because they were really busy but the waitress was really good at making sure I was okay.   It's my first time trying this place and was happy to see that this place was featured in Guy Fiery's Diners, Drive In's and Dives. The food was really good. Man! The fried chicken and waffles was HUUUGE! I'm talking 4 big crunchy pieces and the waffle is big too! It came with some sort of hot sauce/ syrup mix, which was bomb. The corned beef hash and potatoes was like ones I've had at other places but really big portion.   I have to give it 4 Stars because even though the waitress packed all the condiments and utensils, she FORGOT the Strawberry Butter that goes with the waffle! I was so looking forward to trying it! I understand she was busy and was tending tables and stuff....but the disappointment when we opened up the condiment box and not finding the Strawberry Butter.  :(",

My burger was probably the best I've ever had. The carmelized onions and fried jalapenos made the difference.

You can pretty much get anything you want on the menu and customize it to your liking. Their system to do that with their iPad is efficient and accommodating. I ended up getting the Corn Beef Hash and Eggs. Super good. Quality Corn Beef Hash.   Also got the 1/2 Cheeseburger Benedict and 1/2 Crab Cake Benedict. The Cheeseburger was better nevertheless they both were amazing. Super filling and generous with the portions here. Everything here was fresh and made to order.   THE SERVICE. Dang, I wouldn't want to be a cook here during the busy rush!  The way Nick was calling out the orders and running the line like a boss was cool to see but a lot of pressure for the cooks. If you want to have a quiet relaxing breakfast don't sit at the bar like we did during the rush haha. I totally appreciate tho the fast and efficient service we got from the kitchen and Hillary our server. She was so nice and professional. But none of the cooks buckled under pressure. They just kept going snd pumping the food out.   I can see why this place is so successful. Its run like a well oiled machine from the greeters to the servers all helping each other to the kitchen. Would highly recommend coming here for breakfast or brunch!",

The customer service all round was great, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. I had one of their specials that day which was the apple strusel which was amazing! Only thing was that thsir fries weren't good, which they took off the tab and their restrooms weren't all that clean but definitely recommend this place to anyone local or just visiting like us!",

The sandwich had a light vinaigrette sauce that paired well with the ham and eggs. The sandwich was very large and filling. The French toast is made with croissants and topped with powdered sugar. It was quite good. Would recommend.",

Also, My fries came with bits of fatty fried chicken, is this on purpose?  I ordered the grilled cheese with a side of fries.  It's always concerning when you don't know how foreign foods end up in your food.  Maybe the cooks need more training?  I would've rated one star but the service was good, our group of seven is probably not coming back.",

    "text": "My review is for dinner/lunch because we came here in the late afternoon. The place was still busy but the wait for a table for 6 was no more than 10 minutes. The service was great but the dinner food was ok. Nothing really hearty or filling for diner/comfort food. We ordered the meatloaf dinner, club sandwich, chicken fried steak dinner, half order of the chicken & waffles and kids grilled cheese. The meatloaf was delicious but only two small slices. For the price, were expecting a huge platter of meat. The club was mediocre with way too much sharp cheddar cheese that was over powering all the other flavors, I ended up picking it off. The chicken fried steak was good but again, not a lot for the price. The half order of chicken and waffles was perfect for our 11 year old. The syrup is a hot sauce blend to give it a little kick. The kids grilled was a regular size sandwich but had entirely way too much cheese for a kids meal. I had to cut off so much cheese so my 3 year old would eat it. You think of diner food you want comfort hearty food and I didn't feel Metro was that, at least not for lunch/dinner Foods. I have heard good things about their breakfast which is more reasonably priced so I would be back to try it out. But would not return for lunch/dinner. That staff was amazing, so nice and attentive which is why they get three stars.",

The order of the huevos ranchero was absolutely atrocious. The beans were cold. The food was completely cold. There were no chorizo. Just this sausage to compensate. What's worse is it looked like they opened up a fresh can of whatever was in there and dumped it in making everything soggy. Absolutely terrible. Disgusting. Inedible.",

I wish the chunks of meat were bigger In the gravy, but they were tiny. The second time I got the chicken and waffles, and it was very good. Kinda on the salty side, but that is ok because I like salt.  They third time I got chicken and waffles again because I liked it before, but this time it was bland. Different cooks don't put much seasoning?  I may give them another shot, but the food was only good 1 time out of 3 so I am not sure if I want to roll the dice again.",

Our service was excellent which we had grown accustomed to at this restaurant! When he noticed our drinks getting low, he brought new ones without us needing to ask. I believe that he met Metro Diner's service standards.  When the Metro Diner management read our last poor review they immediately reached out and wanted to make it right. We really appreciated their effort and really made up for poor last visit.   Fantastic food and exceptional service!",

The girl who took our order came back with our drinks and before you know it, some guy was delivering our French Toast!   The bread was soggy and the syrup was watered down!  Who does that!  Is maple syrup so expensive that places have to water them down?  We were never asked if everything was ok - nada - zippo.  The girl came by as she was dropping drinks off at another table and dropped off our check.  Never asked us if everything was ok - if we wanted anything else - didn't notice we left half our meal  Our bill was $23.77 - a total waste  - and that is what we left.  No tip!    Won't be going back there anymore.  Lousy food and crappy service.",

Everything is handmade in this restaurant, from my buffalo sauce to the delicious chips on Mikes plate. Both our meals were fantastic and the service excellent and oh so friendly.

    "text": "It's like your classic breakfast joint (IHOP, Dennys, Egg Works, etc) but it has more of a community feel. It's most definitely a chain restaurant, but they somehow captured the feel of a small community diner. Plus, they have more option than your average breakfast joint.  As someone who spent a lot of time living in Texas, it was nice to see some grits (cheesy or plain) on the menu. I got them plain with my Bissell breakfast, and oh boy, it was like nostalgia with every creamy bite. They're not bad, but they definitely don't compare to the grits you get back in the South.  As for the rest of the Bissell breakfast, I got 2 sunny side up eggs, dry sourdough toast, bacon, grits, and half a waffle (subbed a waffle instead of pancakes). The eggs were okay. Nothing that warrants a deeper explanation. They were cooked fine. I feel like everything was cooked well, but nothing really sets this place apart in terms of taste/flavor.   What makes this place unique is the options they have like chicken and waffles and grits as well as their homey, community feel. Other than that, the flavor is pretty average in the sense that I got what I expected and wasn't completed blown away.  The service was spot on and our waitress came by every 5-10min or so to refill waters and ask if we needed anything. Something that sets them apart from other chains is their service. I feel like their waiters waitresses are all very friendly and approachable.  Overall, if you're looking for a decent breakfast place that makes you feel very welcomed and you want some more breakfast variety, Metro Diner is your place.",

My husband liked his omelette, but his grits were also salty. My youngest got the grilled cheese and he liked it. My oldest thought his food was good, but not great. Both were disappointed that there was no iced coffee. The place was clean and for a Sunday late morning we were seated in less than 20 min.

I've learned a lot about to do's and do not's when pleasing customers.  When I walked in the hostess was sweet and kind with her words, and I enjoy the first face I see every morning when entering a restaurant. When I sat down at the diner bar no one was sitting there which I enjoy because I like my space when eating alone. A server came up to me and asked me what I wanted to drink right away. I ordered a large apple juice and the ounces where not a large because I got 8oz. Instead should have gotten a 16oz but that is just my opinion, The 8oz was 3.99.   I ordered two egg breakfast: 2 eggs over easy, lightly toasted sourdough bread, crispy bacon, and cheesy grits.  My order came out perfect as always which I think anyone enjoys when their order is right, but half way through my meal my check came out to me when I was not done. I understand some people like the check right away but not me. I just feel the servers should know there customers and make sure they cater to them because that is what we pay for, the customer service and quality of the meal. I know if Darla G was here she would have waited till the end to give it to me.  All in all I enjoy coming here because they have excellent customer service, speedy service and also the food is always amazing.  Hats off to the cooks for always serving me a delicious meal. Thanks again Metro Diner for excellent quality service.",

I had the Chicken & Waffles which trumps any other chicken and waffles plate I've eaten ANYWHERE else in Vegas! The chicken breast was huge but very juicy and tender where a lot of other places tend to overcook the chicken breast. TONS of flavor in every bite and I couldn't finish my plate due to the amazing portion size. You definitely get more than what you pay for and our server was not only extremely friendly but very prompt with drinks and making sure that we were very well taken care of.

First off this place is a much-needed relief from the standard heavy breakfast oriented Bland diners that is littered throughout Las Vegas.  You can get breakfast and dinner entrees all day here. I went with the meatloaf plate which came with a nice size portion of mashed potatoes and gravy, and some sliced squash and zucchini that was grilled and of course the meatloaf came with gravy and a slice of a baguette. It was really impressive on how fast they got my order and the food out to me given that it was lunch time and the place was bustling. Service was Top Notch, food was Top Notch and the atmosphere was really buzzing. Just an excellent place to come in for a quick bite on your lunch hour and I will probably be back for breakfast on the weekend when I can have some chicken and waffles and take my time drinking a few cups of coffee.",

It was cool eating at the high top section, because I got to see all the hard workers in the kitchen-- they were so fast & efficient! The only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of 5, is because I specifically asked if their \"over-medium\" egg yolks are pretty runny (because I like them to be partially cooked & partially runny) & my server confidentially said \"no they aren't very runny at all, that's over-easy\" Well, I got my meal and my eggs were very runny. I spoke to another server about it and he mentioned that my server should've said the exact opposite & their over-medium eggs are still pretty runny. He sincerely apologized & discounted my meal. All in all, I would highly recommend this place! Waffles are great & the croissant breakfast sandwich is my favorite!",

I got the chicken and waffles that were recommended by a friend and it's super huge! Way more than I could eat at one sitting. They served it with syrup mixed with hot sauce... interesting flavor.  The waffle was really good... I am kind of picky with my chicken so I didn't even eat it, the crust was just off it seemed.  My favorite right now is the chicken salad with honey mustard. It's not anything super special but the veggies are crunchy fresh and I really like their honey mustard dressing. The chicken on this salad has always been good... not sure why the chicken with the chicken and waffles was so bad that one time.  Sweet tea isn't super common here in Vegas so I order it here and it's always good.  This place has a large menu and is worth trying, I'm sure you'll find something you enjoy.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but I've given it 3 chances and I think I'm about done. I definitely recommend you check it out, your experience might be different.   First time I went it in, service was great for a party of two. The waitress was friendly, explained all the specials, and was attentive. They were pretty busy which probably led to confusion. We ordered our food and shortly after we were brought someone else's food. When we told the waiter it wasn't ours he looked a bit annoyed and confused. The customers behind us told him it was their food. Not a big deal, it was busy. Eventually our food came out but the orders were wrong and had to send them back. The manager was very nice and apologized. Didn't think much of it because it was busy.  We came back a second time, they were busy again but we were sat down within minutes. This time we were sat at a table that had just been cleaned, but the seats and table were still wet. We asked for napkins to wipe down the excess water but no one came back with napkins. I took napkins from the table nearby ( I know not cool) and when the waiter saw me cleaning he didn't say anything. We instead got a different waitress. She was nice and friendly as well. Food came out and it was the wrong  order again. I felt bad sending it back but we were both missing/had wrong items. Manager came over and apologized.  Last and final try. Wasn't greeted, someone just told us to pick a seat. Took a while for someone to come over to our table, no napkins, no silver ware. They weren't that busy, it was a Friday around mid morning. We finally got service but weren't told about specials, waitress seemed a little impatient to take our order. We didn't get refills on coffee or water; when I asked the waitress for silverware she seemed bothered and didn't give us napkins. My eggs were very runny and had to send them back.   The food is what you expect diner food to be: big plates and satisfies that diner food craving. I was hoping this would be my breakfast spot but hey it's vegas and there are plenty of other options. Happy dining to you all!",

The food came out fairly quick, but it seemed my husband's  fish and chips could have used a couple more minutes in the fryer and my Mom's chicken pot pie could have used a few more minutes in the oven.  The best part of a pot pie, in my opinion, is the crust.  This was beige and soggy instead of golden and flakey.  My Greek salad was substantial in size, but the added shrimp that I ordered grilled tasted of freezer.  Maybe if I ordered it blackened, perhaps, it would have been better?  With that said, will give them another try, but maybe next time for breakfast in the a.m. (breakfast served all day).",

Food was great, I got the shrimp and grits, which was much different than I've ever had. You get two grit cakes in a huge bowl of super creamy gravy with bacon, scallions, sausage, and a million huge shrimp. I was pleasantly surprised to see how generous they are with shrimp.

And to all the servers and who works in the kitchen for being so nice, having a positive attitude, and making the food delicious. I loved their meat lovers omelette with buttery toast and I added cheese on hashbrowns. Their hashbrowns are crispy on top.

You know how it goes ..sometimes you just want chicken n waffles for dinner lol This restaurant is conveniently located in the southwest on the southwest corner of Warm Springs and Rainbow in the same plaza as Bonsai Sushi, Jinju Chocolates, and Kung Fu Tea etc.   We came in on a Saturday around 11:30am. Surprisingly it was not busy so the hostess welcomed us in and seated us right away. Our server was very nice and very thorough with the menu and explained how their iPad ordering pad works. Whatever we order she puts it in the iPad and sends it straight to the kitchen. No paper or pen needed. After she took our order she kind of disappeared on us. Our waters never came so we had to wave down 2 different people to ask for our waters. About 20 mins later our food actually came out before our water did. We had to ask the person who dropped our food off for water and then another person again.   Eggs Benedict Chicken & Waffles - This was on their specials board and since I'm a sucker for eggs Benedict we had to order it. It was good. Eggs were poached perfectly and hollandaise was delish. Chicken was crispy as was my waffle.   Strawberry Butter - absolutely love this. They charge $.50 for every side of strawberry butter. It didn't come with my Benedict but I had to try it and glad I did bc it was yummy.  Shrimp and grits - Shrimp and sausage in a delicious sauce served over a grits cake. I loved everything but the grits cake. I was hoping for that delicious creamy grits but instead we got these grits cakes with a weird chewy outside texture. I'm gonna see if they'll let me try it over their cheesy grits next time lol  Will definitely be back again to try something new on their menu. Don't forget to try their strawberry butter. You'll love it.",

    "text": "I wanted to like it, and I kinda did - except for the most important part of my entree.  Metro Diner is a chain that originated as a restaurant in Florida, which became popular due to being featured on the TV show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. I've been interesting in trying them for a while and finally got the opportunity to do so with friends on a late Saturday morning.  This is the oldest still-running of 3 locations in Vegas (the first one on Tropicana was shut down). It's on the southwest corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs in a plaza with a few other eateries. Despite being the only breakfast-type there and not having a super huge dining room, it somehow seems to fill the parking lot on its own. That said, I was still able to park without doing weird shenanigans like going across the street, and we probably only had to wait ~15-20 minutes for a table.  Let's get to the good parts. Service was pretty fast and attentive. Food came out quickly enough. Some of my friends' dishes were quite lovely and I'd order them for myself. The Charleston Shrimp & Grits ($17.49) had a rich gravy and an interesting fried grit \"cake.\" I abstained from snagging a shrimp because those didn't seem that plentiful, but I liked the addition of bacon. I also enjoyed the Apple Yo Hala (a special of the day) is an apple variant of their TV-featured challah French toast. The bread was soft and almost custardy, and the apple and other toppings were delicious without being too sweet.  I also almost completely devoured my own entree, the Fried Chicken and Waffle ($15.99). It's a half-chicken's worth of breaded and fried bird with a quartered waffle, and they serve it with strawberry-infused butter and a syrup with Louisiana hot sauce mixed in (or not, if you don't want that). The waffle was pretty awesome, with a crispy exterior and very fluffy interior. I could almost eat them alone, but I couldn't refuse the not-so-hot syrup or strawberry butter.  The problem was my chicken, and there were two issues. No, they weren't dry, thank goodness, but they were all so very greasy. This is unforgivable because it's an intentional part of the recipe. Heck, it's listed as 2360 calories on the menu. Just drain the damn oil and you'll have a nice crispy breading with moist if not juicy meat inside (breast is obviously the worst, but not dry).  The other issue might be a one-time thing, but every piece of chicken was very salty. I thought it was just the batter at first, but I started tasting it in the meat and resigned myself to high blood pressure hell at that point. You can kinda balance it out with the waffles and such, but the salt is too aggressive even then.  I will consider going back to Metro Diner, especially the Henderson location which would be a shorter drive for me, but I won't reorder the grease and salt bomb. It was so promising and could have gotten there with the proper attention to detail.",

I had high hopes for them base on the pictures and other reviews. But I would give them another chance since the chicken was very good and the customer service was great which is pretty refreshing for Las Vegas but I wont be ordering gravy grits......",

Ok, those are fries with BROWN gravy & melted mozzarella:) Metro serves up piping hot generous portions and at lighting speed.  Another thing one can bank on is friendly and fast service!  They have pretty damn good coffee, plain or choice of hazelnut.  Nope, no blue plastic creamer containers for the hazelnut- the hazelnut has its own pot of coffee! Insert clapping hand emojis please.  I built my own omelet, and it was cooked perfectly with my choice of sauteed onions, asparagus, mushrooms and melted Swiss.  Excellent, neat and plated oh so nicely.  I did keep eyeing other people's choices (dishes, yes I eyed all dishes leaving that kitchen)!  Next time, that apple French toast with almonds is Mine!!  I will share, but only share the picture of it:). Our waitress was quite the server with one of he best dispositions of polite.  I have her warning, asked permission and snapped a picture of her and posted it here on Yelp!",

I really wanted to like this place, since it was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\" So disappointed but at least I finally tried this place out. The service was okay and food came out at a proper pace, hence the two stars. If you are a person who actually knows how to cook, skip this place and cook at home. Your food will end up the way you want it and you will end up spending less money on ingredients that will last you days.",

My boyfriend had the corn beef hash and I had two eggs with bacon. Both dishes were great and a good portion. John was so accommodating to our needs especially when we asked for a side of rice and avocado. The teas came in fancy yummy flavors. They used a very fancy and updated iPad system to take orders and pay for efficiency. Prices were reasonable also.",

We NEVER order dessert but the thought of peach cobbler made this a must tonight. Absolutely amazing - fresh, light crust, not overly sweet and the 'a la mode' put it over the top. The service was exceptional. The management staff go out of their way to be sure you're happy. Prices were soooo very reasonable for what they offer. Can't wait to go back for breakfast soon.

We got the Fried Chicken and Waffles, Blueberry Cream Cheese Waffles, Meatloaf plate, and Bissel Breakfast. The hashbrowns were only meh but their specials were delicious. I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles and the meatloaf. I would return and try some other things like the crab benedict but first comers should first order what Metro Diner is known for.",

    "text": "So my first time coming to this place, I came at night with two of my friends. And while I'm usually one who is quick to decide on what I'd like to order, my friends had a lot of questions. Our server at the time was Dario, and he was very, VERY helpful with every question my friends threw at him. Took about 10 minutes for our food to get to us; overall, it was a great, first-time experience. Zero complaints.  My second time coming to this place, I came in the afternoon and had Monique as my server. I came by myself this time, so getting my order placed went through quickly because like I said, I'm very fast on deciding what to order. It was also really busy at the time; every table was taken and there were people literally standing outside as they were waiting because of how packed it was. But surprisingly, my order didn't even take 10 minutes to make it to me.  Both Dario and Monique were very friendly servers; they definitely gave me a welcoming kind of vibe. Big shoutout to the two of them :)",

I went with my wife and three toddlers, as you can imagine, our table can be a handful and is prone to sudden urgent needs, such as a new fork, 10,000 napkins, or another plate of pancakes (seriously have no idea where they put them, I'd look like a TV weatherman if I ate like them). Tim was responsive and exceptionally friendly the whole time- he even laughed at my dad jokes, which is impressive, because my usual audience is toddlers, so I lack practice in entertaining without fart noises.",

Perfect size portions and the onion rings were crisp and delicious, then on to desert, peach cobbler with some vanilla ice cream on top! My most favorite desert in the entire world lives here now!

Diners are hit, or miss, and Metro Diner was definitely a hit. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and made sure our first experience was a good one. I ordered the Avocado Veggie Wrap with regular jalapenos instead of fried ones, and a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Both the wrap, and side salad were filling, and full of flavor. I really enjoyed the balsamic vinaigrette they had, and you could tell it was homemade rather than store bought. My boyfriend ordered the Fried Chicken Plate with macaroni & cheese. My boyfriend is picky with his fried chicken, and luckily, this meal earned his stamp of approval. The waitress mixed together syrup and hot sauce as a sauce for him to dip his chicken in, which also delicious. Metro Diner is reasonably priced, and has a great variety of food to choose from. We will definitely be back soon.",

    "text": "Horrible experience from start to finish. One waitress asks for our drink order which was a coffee and OJ. She doubles back in a minute to ask if that was 2 OJ's and a coffee?  Then another server stops by to take our drink order? We're all set the other girl took our order (We hoped). I understand corporate stores but this training for new staff was horrible so far. Only 3 or 4 tables in entire store were occupied when we arrived early. We placed our food order and I watched as the QA (quality assurance) guy slash manager was trying to quarterback the room. His job is to read the orders placed under the heat lamp, ,make sure the right items are on the plates and call for runners to take food. My order was the 3 egg combo and it arrived with 2 eggs.......Not major problem yet but keep in mind these servers place orders on a tablet and don't have to even use memory to try and make it to the closest POS and enter everything like other places. Then you take into account that this place has a QA manager to double check cooks errors. I also noticed toast wasn't buttered. I asked for butter and why wasn't it buttered and the manager/QA guy says it is upon request only. Hmmmmm, why weren't we informed by server I asked to which he replied, they are supposed to. He took entire plate back to the kitchen instead of getting me butter or a new batch of buttered toast when I could have began to eat. In NY, that is illegal to take food away and bring it back, even to take leftovers home, they just bring you the box instead of walking your food around the restaurant. Training horrible from top to bottom. Will never be back nor refer to this place or the $4 Orange juice to anyone !!",

The 'newness' hasn't seemed to wear off of the employees -- they are all really good folks and the service is as good as anywhere else. So far I've had - the meatloaf plate, chicken pot pie (with 2 slice of cheese melted on top), the fried chicken plate, Big Bern's Pork Tenderloin sandwich, Philly Cheese Steak and a breakfast of corned beef hash and eggs. Some of these I've ordered more than once. All of the lunch items have been outstanding. The price isn't cheap but neither is the food. In this case you truly get what you pay for. I've been to both the Rainbow location and the Tropicana and can't wait until the Henderson location opens this month across from the DMV (there are a bit over 100 employees at that DMV that are chomping at the bit to walk across the street!). A truly wonderful place, a terrific team of servers and support workers and gracious management. I can't wait to try the Monte Cristo, pot roast, fish chips - and the burgers I've seen look amazing.",

The hostess was friendly the waitress was fine I noticed that the floors are extremely slippery I don't know if it's what they're using to clean the floor, something on the mop, or just the floor itself. After I placed my order I was on yelp reading the rest of the reviews. I came across one review that commented that there waitress left the check on the table while they were still eating. About two minutes after the food made it to the table our waitress came by and put the check on the table and said that we could add dessert to it or just keep it the way it is. Our waitresses name was Darla G. Otherwise she was very knowledgeable on the menu items and how they are made and had new drinks on our table the minute we needed them without even having to be asked. So the reason for four stars instead of five is the check on the table cause I think it's a little bit rude. Makes me think of the back of my head that she's never going to come back and check on us.

My boyfriend got the huevos rancheros and he didn't like it at all. Everything tasted of low quality and after two bites it was very salty. I went to culinary school for 2 years so I know what an over easy egg is and my boyfriends eggs were a little under. Not crazy under but enough that it looked like snot and I didn't want to eat it. I've never had to send back an over easy egg and when I told the waitress that they were a little under for my boyfriends taste she went on to try to explain what an over easy egg is. I know what an over easy egg is. They poach their eggs instead of fry which might have been why the egg whites were a little snotty unlike fried eggs, any way he ordered the special which was a breakfast quesadilla instead and again low quality ingredients in mass amounts. He was only able to eat one slice because of the grease. I ended up getting the croissant sandwich with egg cheese and sausage. Simple enough. And I got a side of home fries because the sandwich came with nothing. The home fries tasted like they were frozen then fried. Some tasted good but then you got a potato that tasted like freezer burn and the sandwich was whatever. I could only eat half and I had to add a good amount of ketchup. Jack in the box makes a better sandwich.",

It is that good. I had the chicken and waffles with their sweet and spicy syrup (syrup mixed with their hotsauce) and it was great! The Fried Chicken is better than Southern Baptist Church Fried Chicken, and for those who understand that reference, you get it. For those that do not understand the reference, that means it is amazing. The waffles have a strawberry butter, yes you read that right, STRAWBERRY BUTTER, on them. The portion is pretty large and you could probably have enough for two decent meals with just one. My wife had just the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. She is a macaroni and cheese critic and travels the country looking for the best (well not really, but sounds fun though), point is she loves mac and cheese and she said this was some of the best she ever had. The kids had waffles and enjoyed them as well. The next morning I had a chicken biscuit, it was fantastic as well. Overall, this is a great place to eat and the service was over the top good. I highly recommend and we will definitely be back.",

The hollandeise sauce was dripping in oil.Tasted like the butter you get at the movies that had been sitting for days. The hash browns well they tasted like somebody poured entire bottle of salt on them. That I couldn't even try to eat. I would recommend never going to this establishment.  My friend had chicken pot pie. She said the reviews on here for it was good. After the 2nd bite I asked her to rate it. She said she gave it a 2. It had no sauce in it and looked like they put a can of mixed vegetables in the bottom of the dish. It had 3 very small chewy pieces of chicken in it..  Again do not eat at this place.",

The chicken tasted as though it was fried in burnt oil.   My husband got sick the next day but that may be a coincidence.  I was really hoping for the best with the reputation they had.

One of the waitresses was sweating profusely. Her uniform shirt was soak and sweat was dripping off of her face...it was really gross to see that. Fortunately for me she wasn't waiting on me I would've asked to be moved or would've left. She needed to go back in the bathroom and put on a different blouse wash her self up before serving another customer.  I had the chicken and waffles which was delicious. That strawberry butter was fantastic. I'm not big on the spicy syrup and had just regular maple syrup. I'm glad they told me that syrup was spicy before I even poured it on my food. The bathroom needed cleaned. I blame that on other women who are pigs though and can't dry off the countertops when I dry their hands. There's no excuse for toilet paper being all over the floor either. These women's homes I hope don't look like that and it shouldn't look like that in a restaurant either. Women, clean up after yourself and dry the sink tops off for the next person.  It is a little pricey for this kind of restaurant. I just got done paying $19 for Chicken and Waffles today on my order to go. You do get 1/2 a chicke and a huge Belgium waffle...enough for two... I wanted to also try the pulled pork with the macaroni cheese and the wall for today. I was told it wouldn't be ready till after 3 o'clock. That was a bummer that would've been a nice lunch... Food is really good! Thanks",

There are a few items on the menu I personally did not like, but they more than make up for it in the items I do like. Such as their shrimp and grits, the chicken and waffles.  My biggest complaint is the fact they only have two single restrooms. It sucks at times seeing a line for the restroom. But, it's very clean every time I've been there so I'll survive.

We came at a really good time, it was about 4pm, and no waiting, sat promptly and drink orders were taken right away, even before meeting out server. The staff there were very friendly and everybody seemed to get along well. Our server, Dario, was friendly and very knowledgeable with all the specials of the day. I saw an order of chicken and waffles that was ginormous so I knew right then what I was getting. My friend Karen wasn't as sure since everything on the menu looked delicious!  Dario was very patient and helpful as he helped her navigate the menu. She finally settled on the blackened chicken tenders but was really feeling the meatloaf. What was making her apprehensive was the meatloaf had mushrooms which, she's not a fan of the fungus but Dario assured her she wouldn't taste it because of how it was prepared. So we compromised and order a slice ala carte for 2.50. So glad we did because we both thought it was amazing! Now back to my chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy and fried to perfection. The waffles with the strawberry butter that had real strawberry pieces in the butter and powder sugar complimented the waffles perfectly. Then of course to really enjoy the chicken and waffles, Dario made this syrup/hotsauce combo that was great for dipping, don't let the hotsauce/syrup scare you,it went well with the chicken and waffles. We definitely will come back and hopefully Dario is working because he made our dining experience very enjoyable.",

We will definitely go back!!!",

    "text": "Full and somewhat satisfied. Diners are some of my favorite places to eat, so my standards can be pretty high. My hubby & I went during noontime, he ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich with French fries, and I ordered the western omelette with hash-Browns. We also got a waffle to share. The food was bland, nothing remarkable unfortunately. The price are okay, but more so for the portion you get as opposed to quality. The portions are huge.  The waffle was good, light and flakey but not soft. The coffee was great, I like their own brewed coffee. Overall it's okay. Maybe we'd try it again, but we would order different things.",

The colors would complement the green tables and checkered floor to perfection! (I know a talented artist that lives here in Vegas if the owner would like to contact me for an estimate!

Service is so excellent that they're able to keep up with some custom orders AND get them out in a timely, with a smile. Today's option was the mom omelette with two extra eggs, a beef patty, and extra crispy hash INSIDE the omelette... previous orders were Charleston shrimp and Grits with 4 extra pics of fried chicken... A burger with and extra regular party, chorizo party, fried egg, poached egg, and all the fixings. These guys will do any food item.  You may be thinking that all this heaviness is a bit much, but I'm accustomed to heavy dishes and they're a diner that actually doesn't overdo it with the grease... unless you ask them to. Great flavors. The chicken is almost always magically juicy. The grits have a nice crispy outside texture and smooth inside texture. The burgers are always done well. The hazelnut coffee hits the spot before a really heavy workout session. Great food and great atmosphere.  Will definitely eat again.  P.s.  I eat here 2 hours before a workout on weekends. Once that coffee hits you after your meal, you'll have the ability to go on forever. I hit a PR last time I ate here.",

It wasn't spicy, the bacon and green onion topping was missing, and the manager never stopped back by like the waitress said she would. I don't blame the waitress for any of these missteps as she did a really good job and apologized twice for the mistakes. We'll possibly try again sometime in the future.",

The sourdough is fried to a perfect crisp. And when they say it is stuffed with turkey and ham, they mean it is STUFFED. The raspberry preserves were a bit different (I'm used to strawberry) but it complimented the sandwich very well.  I need to plan a trip back to Metro Diner asap to try more of their menu, especially the chicken and waffles!",

    "text": "Metro Diner - Las Vegas, NV (Rainbow Location)  Prior to this visit, I've only eaten at the Tropicana location.  I can vouch for the food and the excellent service at the Trop location.  I have never received less than stellar service from an employee of Metro Diner and food has always been good. So, I expected the same excellence at this Metro Diner.  Our main server was Mary Lu and she was great.  She even recognized us from the other location.  She is a machine, a well-oiled machine.  She was taking orders, serving the food, checking up on guests, and cashing them out.  This Metro is new and I assume that most of the staff is new too. Thank goodness for Mary Lu.    As for their food, it's all good. The have their signature dishes like the Chicken & Waffles, the Shrimp & Grits, the Bold Burger, the Chicken Pot Pie, and the fried sourdough Monte Cristo.  There's also a ton of other breakfast dishes, burgers, sandwiches, and seafood in the menu. Here's a tip...most dishes are huge.  Come here hungry or expect to take home leftovers.  I've tried half of their signature dishes and recommend the Chicken Pot Pie.  My favorite dish isn't even on their menu.  I love their Meat Lover's Omelet.  It's a handful of eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, and awesomeness.  It's not on their menu, but they can create it for you.  On my most recent visit, I got their hamburger patty with a side of eggs.  And because Metro Diner allows you to make substitutions on almost everything, I swapped the hash browns for a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup. This cup of soup is also worth the trip back.  I know, I'm raving about broccoli.  Who loves broccoli?  Well, I do if it's at Metro Diner.  I highly recommend this as a side.  My mom would be proud.  I ate all my veggies.   Overall, I am more than just a fan.  I think Metro Diner is as good as it gets when it comes to breakfast eats.  It also doesn't hurt that Metro Diner believes in great customer service.  If I have one regret, it's giving the Tropicana location just 4-stars because they're better than that.  In fact, I'm changing that review to 5-stars soon.",

    "text": "Inside: I really liked the vibe of this diner - it's very classic, has appropriate decorations and cute booths to sit in.   Food: It wasn't anything amazing, but I still enjoyed it. I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The dish should have had more flavor to complement the wonderful hollandaise sauce. I was bummed that the avocado wasn't very ripe and also that it was so hard to eat a single bite of the Benedict because everything fell apart so easily :( My dish came with hash browns, which are, well, hash browns - nothing fancy.   Service: This is what got me... our waitress was not very attentive, while many other waiters who weren't assigned to my table came over to check on me multiple times. I don't understand why the waitress who was assigned my table wasn't as helpful as all the others in the diner? Additionally, she brought the check to our table MINUTES after my friends and I got our food, and said \"no rush but here's the check.\" Needless to say I felt rushed.   Overall, I'd like to come back to try their Chicken and Waffles, but I'm not sold on their service. I don't like to judge the whole business on one waitress's service, but it wasn't the most amazing experience for me.",

I had the half order which was still a lot, the full order is huge meant for 2 people.   My son hand the chicken fried steak also very good, the gravy could use a little more seasoning but added a little hot sauce and whalla yummy!   My husband had the basic bacon and eggs.    What was great is all of our food came out at the same time! Loved that.  Our water cups and coffee was always refilled without asking!   Great place!",

A friend was actually telling me to check this place out and that it was really quite good!  (+) Chicken and Waffles($15.99) were outstanding! The chicken was very tender and juicy and the skin tasted just right! The real star of the show here are those waffles! Damn! So freaking good! Add some maple syrup and some strawberry butter and wow! Definitely coming back for more of those!  The beef tips were tasty and tender and the mushroom sauce was thick and delicious! The mashed potatoes were great too! Nice and thick and fluffy. Very good.  (-) The only item I wasn't a fan of were the cheesy tots. Think of the sour onion ruffles chip flavor mixed with hash browns. Sounds better on paper than it actually is IMO.  (+) Service was friendly and accommodating and everyone we interacted with was smiling. Drinks were always topped off before running out. Could not ask for better service.  (-) I honestly don't even know if this is Metro Diner's responsibility with all the other business' around, but the real problem I ran into was all the garbage in the parking lot. A bit surprising considering how new the area is. I accidentally ran over a beer bottle(??) while backing out. This was quite annoying.  That aside, we really enjoyed this place immensely and plan on coming back...and soon! There were quite a few menu items we made note of to try in future visits!   4 stars.",

    "text": "Staying with the theme of eating where the locals eat on top of wanting some comfort food on a cool night, the next adventure took my bud and I to the Metro Diner. Located on the corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs Road, it's hard to miss. Now, before coming here I didn't know this was a place Guy Fieri had visited on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but sure enough his pictures with staff are right there when you walk in.  We were quickly seated and the menus were waiting at the table. The menu at Metro Diner has an amazing variety of food items in all three phases of breakfast, lunch and dinner. For some reason on this night, the call of chicken parmesan beckoned. Now, this is my go-to anytime I eat Italian so it was a bit of a leap of faith that I was ordering at one of the least Italian places you could eat at. Thankfully I wasn't betrayed because the chicken parm was excellent. You get three (3!) freshly fried chicken cutlets covered with a tasty marinara and melted mozzarella. Next to it was a small bed of pasta covered in the same sauce and a couple of slices of garlic bread. Our server warned us about the generous portions and she wasn't kidding.  Speaking of service she was fast, friendly and attentive. Refills came quickly without having to bug anyone. The manager also came to our table to check on us. I've slowed my roll on handing out five star reviews but this is the third restaurant out of three since I've been in Vegas where I could find nothing wrong. The food was great, it came out fast and the service was top notch. This place has incredible ratings on Yelp for a reason. Highly recommended.",

Our food arrived in a timely fashion and all together, which isn't always he case at diners. The manager (?) even stopped by to see how we were doing - which was nice.   I ordered the 3 egg special with hashbrowns, bacon, and toast. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hashbrowns had an excellent crispy top, and the bacon was done to a solid medium. The only real complaint I have is that the toast was a little too toasted, but it appears it was a one-time issues as the others we were with hadn't had the same issue before.   I recommend Metro Diner for a great family-friendly breakfast!",

I saw that this place does half pound burgers and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try it! It's a small place but with plenty of seating space and a couple TV's to watch some sports. It has the old 50s style diner vibe but they use tablets to place orders and pay bills making it a bit reminiscent of the second back to the future.   Angela was our server and came over greeting us and offering us both food and drink suggestions. She was such a sweetheart with a vibrant smile who talked to us like we were old friends! It was by far some of the best service we have had. Now the food:  Coffee- Wasnt very good or strong, tasted like water but the Hazelnut was much stronger and good without being overly sweet. Meatloaf- crispy outside with a soft moist inside that was packed with pepper flavor. Red skin mashed- Basic Brown Gravy- Pretty good and not overly salty. Vegetables- Holy hell these were amazing! it was some of the best grilled zucchini and squash I have ever had! I shoulda went double on this instead of the mashed! 12 incher- its a giant pancake that is exactly what you expect. Nothing too special, probably coulda used a little powdered sugar for presentation but it was a nice shareable item!  Overall it was a good experience. Most the food was a 3 to 4 but the service was a 5. I want to go back to try one of the behemoth burgers that my friends got, or maybe one of the sandwiches.",

    "text": "For a little neighborhood diner, Metro Diner is a-okay. This isn't game changing food, but the employees are friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming.   Parking can be tricky during busy times. I came here for dinner with two friends and the place was nearly empty. A chalkboard lists the daily specials, and the creamy tomato soup tempted me so I ordered that along with a steak and cheese sandwich (low carb style: no bread) and sauteed squash as my side instead of fries. My dining companions had a side salad and a burger with egg (low carb style without a bun) and the other had meatloaf.   The portions were reasonable and weren't too small or too large. The food ranged from tasty to disastrous. The very best thing on the table was the sauteed squash. Fresh, well prepared, and seriously delicious. I would come back here just to eat this side dish. The meatloaf was deemed \"dry and just okay,\" and the only thing unforgettable about the bland salad was the mountain of shredded carrots on top. The burger was cooked medium-rare as requested, but three ingredients were left off the plate. Pay attention to the menu so you get everything you ordered! The steak and cheese was also \"just okay\" and tasted a lot like a Steak-Umm brand frozen beef that I could've made myself at home with similar results.   The worst part of the meal was the soup. It was disgusting. Very thick and nasty, I hated everything about the soup. I would not be surprised if this came out of a big frozen foodservice block. Do not get the soup.   I'm guessing this place does breakfast better than other food so your mileage probably will vary if you go for traditional eggs, pancakes, and bacon.   I won't be in a hurry to return here, but I'll definitely give the place another chance, if only for those sauteed squash!",

It'll add a kick to your taste buds ;-) We also ordered the west omelette and we couldn't finish it.   This place is great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It makes you wanna put 25cents in a juxebox and dance all the food away and eat more! Lol. Wanna upgrade from Denny's/ihop? Come here!",

I have been here several times and everything has always been solid.  You really cannot go wrong with what you order here, including the specials written on the back board. If you like sweet and if it is on the Specials Board go for the Peach Yo Hallah French Toast. It is an intense creation of a cream cheese stuffed French Toast covered in peach compote! It is worth sharing because the portion is huge. The corned beef hash here is great as well as their famous Chicken and Waffles. If you are a tea drinker, they have a wonderful selection of teas as well.  Metro Diner is definitely a solid choice for brunching and lunching and everything in between! Yum!",

    "text": "On my third visit (my 8 year old loves it), the service was basically friendly and the food was tasty.  After our drinks and appetizer came, we both went to the restroom to wash our hands. When we returned, our table was being bussed. That is the first time any such thing has happened to me, especially when I  met the person busing the table coming out of the restroom I was going into.  My son and I both ordered chicken and it took at least 20 or 30 minutes for our order to come out. The server explained once the food came, that several orders of chicken went in at the same time. I believe possibly our order was given to another patron. As soon as the food came and I mean as soon as it was set on the table, the food runner asked if we needed anything else, immediately after, the manger was at our table to see if we needed anything, then 30 seconds later the server asked. We hadn't even had a chance to taste our food!   Once the borage of inquires stopped,  I had a chance to get my son settled and finally taste my food. I cut into my chicken thigh and it was pink. I decided to eat the rest of my food and alert my server when I saw her. Then once I finished my broccoli,  I noticed a small hair floating in the butter sauce.  I stopped eating, but checked to see if the chicken breast was cooked completely. It was. The meat was white and juicy, but I was grossed out. My server and the manager must have been on break.  Another 20 or 30 minutes went by and then they both appeared. When I explained the situation the manager and immediately my plate was taken away to have it  \"refired.\" The server said she understood how uncomfortable I must have been feeling and then proceeded to imply that I should have just continued to eat it!   I was charged for the meal that I did not eat, but they decided to remake as a to go plate. I usually tip upwards of 25% or more at locations I possibly will return to patronize,  but this time, I paid the bill, left an 18% tip, and I will not return to any of their locations.  Not just because of this experience,  but also because on my previous visits I felt tolerated and not welcomed. This final visit proved that I am not welcome.  The response from the owner also missed the mark. To say the FOOD did not meet my standard, is an understatement.  The chicken was PINK. There was pubic hair in my broccoli. That is below any reasonable person's standard and certainly should be below the owner's standard.  Hot food that is not healthy to consume is wasteful. Additionally,  the service was severely lacking. And I paid for that. While I appreciate the owner's attempt to find a positive marketing point for his establishment,  I would not recommend this place.  In fact, every time I drive by, I have a negative and regretful memory.",

That's horrible service but we were on a time limit so we stayed for the food . Huge mistake . I ordered a half sandwich and soup . The bread was plain , not toasted nothing on it just meat and cheese . I had to ask for mayo and mustard.  Brocoli soup had huge chunks of brocoli steams and not hot just barely warm.  My husband's philly was also plain and dry . No much flavor to anything. I dont recommend the food to anyone .",

    "text": "From the second we stepped into Metro Diner, an amazing experience began. The place had to be at capacity but the staff was still some of the happiest I have ever seen. After a 5 minute wait (super impressive considering the amount pf people in there) we were seated and our server, Dario. He immediately asked us how our day was and then gave us a rundown of the daily specials and other notable notable items on the menu. We walked in hungry but after he gave his salivating descriptions, we were starving. Everything, literally everything sounded so good! We ended up going with the 3 egg breakfast and the chicken and waffles, which Dario mentioned was one of the best things on the menu.  Before the food came out, Dario presented me with a dipping sauce that is their own kind of special sauce. It was a mix of maple syrup and Louisiana hot sauce. Despite my insistence that it was not going to be a good mix, he told me to give it a try. When the food came out i was in awe. We paid about $25 for all of the food and got TONS OF FOOD. Ive never seen a better deal! On top of that the food tasted amazing! The chicken, which Dario told us was marinated for 48 hours, was amazing and tasted even better with the syrup/hot sauce concoction. The waffles were topped with a sort of strawberry butter that had small pieces of diced strawberries in it. Again I was blown away by the flavor. The 3 egg breakfast looked like it had at least 4 eggs in it and included toast, hash browns, AND sausage patties. Most places only give you one or the other but this was all of the above for the same price. Impressive. Last but not least. The decor and vibe of this place was awesome. It has an open kitchen with a bar you can sit at and does a good job being crowded, while also feeling spacious. If you are a local, I definitely recommend you try this place over alternatives such as Cracked Egg or Egg Works. I like those places but Metro Diner is KILLING them in every category. Will see you again soon Dario and Metro Diner. You guys are the best!",

It was very good but I did have to church it up with salt, pepper and hot sauce. I totally recommend this dinner to everyone! Parking is the only issue. The location has a very small parking lot. Had to park across the street at the wear houses.",

I asked the waitress to make sure the steak was Medium Rare to Medium and she assured it would be.  It was cooked to perfection!! AND also Crabcakes Benedict w/Avocado added...whaaaaaaaaaaaat!!! The hollandaise sauce was perfect and the egg was dripping with yoke as the fork slid through it . My only suggestion would be to put that fresh Avocado on top after the structure is complete. The way it was made, with the Avo in the middle, made it warm and lost the essence of the cool Avocado. But...all in all, it was delicious. Thanks Alot!!  The wait staff is top notch as well! Our server, Autumn, was very tentative and made sure we were taken care of during start to finish. She made sure our FOOD was correct and looking fantastic!! The manager, as well, was on top of anything that we needed. She made a clear pressence on the floor.  I give the team an all around A+  Thank You!! Eat HERE Yummy yum yum tum tum tum!!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner the other night on Saturday after another busy day this weekend. I have always been a fan of Metro diner so i never mind coming here to try new things every time !   A friend had arrived earlier and was seated waiting for us to arrive. Upon entry, the hostess had instantly known and brought us to join him at the table.   As always, service is great. Very attentive in every way.   I decided to try the Metro Club. It includes ham, turkey, bacon, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on 3 slices of fresh white toast. HUGE sandwich cut into quarters. I only ate 2 quarters and saved the other 2 quarters for breakfast the next day. It comes with half a pickle, which is delicious as always. Lots of meat piled up with a thick slice of bacon. Simple but delicious.   One of my friends got the Bissel Breakfast. Two eggs any style, choice of bacon/ham/sausage, choice of hashbrowns or grits, and a short stack of pancakes. She opt'ed for bacon with hashbrowns. I don't remember the eggs as the yolks were gone FAST ! wtcrap girl ! i didn't even see a drop of residual yolk, anywhere ! the hashbrowns had a very crispy top layer, which almost all disappeared as well, but luckily she got full and i got some of it. HEHE ! Last but not least, the short stack of pancakes. Anyone who knows me knows ive been sick of any sort of pancakes for like the past 10 years, since the one time a few friends and I decided to take advantage of IHOP's free pancake day... For some off reason, this pancake was really good. Another thing i noticed, the syrup was hot ! Unlike the syrups that sit around on the table all day long. I don't know what sort of drug they put in this pancake but it was good ! jk about the drug. i cant explain it !   Last but not least, my other friend ordered the fried chicken & waffle. half a fried chicken and a belgian waffle, topped with powdered sugar and sweet, strawberry butter. Served with their signature sweet and spicy sauce. When the food came, the waitress had accidentally dropped a piece of chicken on the floor. She QUICKLY apologized and had another one made ASAP ! He's not one to eat a small amount but requested help for the chicken. When the replacement piece came, we took it instead. I got the drumstick while my friend who ordered the bissell breakfast took the mid and tip. The chicken was super flavorful and juicy. VERY reminiscent of korean fried chicken i had in Korea ! Even the white meat part that somehow ended up on this wing was very juicy and flavorful. Of course it was super hot since it just came out of of the fryer but dang. They definitely put the chicken in a brine of some sort because, YUM ! Their signature sweet and spicy sauce consists of the previously mentioned warm syrup and hot sauce. The chicken doesn't need anything !! i mean, some spice is always welcome, but if you dont like spice, its definitely not a requirement.   Another good meal ! Cant wait to try other things again !",

Now the moment we came in we were greeted and it felt genuine not forced.. we sat down and right away we were offered coffee. Our server was just amazing and friendly. She gave us the specials and was so patient with us as everything on the menu sounded delicious. My husband decided to go with the crab cake Benedict and I decided to go with the shrimp and grits (half portion). The wait for the order did not take long. During that time our server made sure that our beverages were always full. The food is delicious and fresh. The crab cakes were light and had just the right amount on binding and you can taste the ocean. Poached eggs on top were cooked to perfection and the sauce drizzled on top was the right amount. The shrimp and grits were delicious. The shrimp were cooked right and not overly done. The grits were surprisingly interesting because it was almost like it was deep fried in a square form and had I believe bell peppers inside with cheese. It was delicious! The sauce \"gravy\" had bits of bacon and sausage. Overall it was delicious and they really made you feel so comfortable and like home. Will we be coming back? YES! Would I recommend this place? DEFINITELY! Can't wait to come back and try another item on the menu.",

My philly cheesesteak I ordered was just a french dip, there was way more bread than meat on the sandwich. The All American Burger was fair at best. The fries were undercooked and soggy. Very disappointing. The homecooked fries were pretty good but would be better not crinkle cut. I am sure eating in here is probably pretty good, but I am finding more and more when I order take out from any place in Vegas, the meals are sub par because they can get away with it.",

Let us delve into the Diner's entry into the \"50 shades of gray\" decadent comfort food (because white and dark meat together... no?)  Served all day, the portions we received were substantial; breasts and thighs coated in glistening golden brown breading, each bite emitted a familiar and satisfying crunch that would make Col. Sanders jealous.  The explanation was that these birds were placed in a secret brine for 48 hours, and it held up its juiciness throughout the meal. The delicious birds were accompanied by a healthy amount of waffles, topped off by strawberry butter.  Only time will tell which poultry masterpiece reigns supreme, but in the meantime, feel free to be transported back to the childhood days as the you enjoy every bite of chicken and waffle.",

A Salisbury Steak special of the day was savory and covered with tasty Brown Gravy.  A Brooklynn's Greek Salad featured Kalamata Olives, Feta Cheese, cucumbers, zucchini, Roma tomatoes, hard boiled egg, croutons, Red Onions, pepperoncini, carrot shavings, Iceberg Lettuce, and an authentic Greek Dressing.  The Chicken Pot Pie (I ordered a large, and was glad that I did) was very good, with a creamy inside and golden dough outside.  And unusually dark-skinned but moist Fried Chicken was excellent.  Service here has been attentive, with a managerial tableside visit each time to check on how things went.  And ambiance is deli casual, with basic but functional furniture.  The focus is squarely placed on well-prepared comfort food.  4-1/2 stars overall!",

There's counter service, booths, tables with chairs and a small outdoor seating area. It's a great local spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. In all of the multiple times I've been in, I have never had a meal I did not like!  The staff is always friendly, the service is always great and the food is consistent. The open kitchen let's you watch all of the action. Fresh brewed iced tea and coffee, often with rotating flavors (examples brewing peach, raspberry, mango tea and French vanilla, hazelnut for coffee) Portions are worth the price.  The Food... A few of our favorites are.... 1. The chicken fried steak! It's a real piece of meat, not super processed and frozen. Hand battered when you order and fried to perfection. It is not on the everyday menu, but if you ask and they have all of the necessary ingredients, they'll make one for you.  2. Fried chicken and waffles. Their fried chicken is amazing! Flavorfully seasoned and fried golden brown. The waffle that it is paired with is fantastic too! I like to take some honey or syrup and hot sauce mixed together for a little spicy & sweet dip.  3. Charleston shrimp & grits. The fried grit cakes with cheese, covered in shrimp sauce, topped with shrimp, bacon is both filling and tasty.  4. Huevos Rancheros. This is when I found their magical fried jalapenos slices (that go good on EVERYTHING). It's breakfast nachos.",

I got really excited when this location opened since it was really close to my home, so I've gone here probably four times since it opened. Everything I've had has been really delicious with one exception - my Holy Davoli Burger was moderately overcooked. I didn't actually notice for the first few bites but I did notice it was lacking flavor for such a ridiculous burger. It is a burger that uses grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns.  Unfortunately the burger was probably medium-well or well done and simply had no moisture left in it, which led to the whole sandwich being dull.  Still, I've had the chicken salad sandwich, the chicken and waffles, a fruity waffle, as well as the steak sandwich with fries in it. I've also sampled a number of other dishes. The steak sandwich I would categorize as okay (just wasn't impressed by the flavor combo) and everything else has been quite delicious. Their fried chicken in particular is very good.",

This has chunks of white meat chicken mixed with just the right amount of mayonnaise, purple grapes, celery, and more. A generous amount of chicken salad is placed in the center of iceberg lettuce with croutons and a full hard boiled egg. Not only is this salad very filling, but you're also able to purchase the chicken salad on its own to go.",

I almost kidnapped the cooks but then I might go to jail so I just didn't do it.   Everyone was super nice, especially our server \"Javier\". That alone is a good enough reason to come back. Service like that is missed in the food business. Glad to know they keep that tradition alive & kicking........  Oh, and \"David\" the owner is the best. He makes his rounds and speaks to the people unlike many other bosses out here. We laughed with him and it made us feel even better spending money with them. If you're in Vegas anytime soon, you HAVE TO stop by. That chicken & waffles are THEE SH*T so I'm sure everything else on the menu is just as good.......  Metro Diner, THANK YOU !!!!",

They serve breakfast,lunch and dinner all day but majority of the people in our group ordered breakfast. The biggest take away is all in the subtle details that make this place so amazing.   We ordered their chicken and waffles, and instead of strawberries to top, it comes with a STRAWBERRY BUTTER! What! So good! They also  pre-warmed the syrup before serving it to the table, that alone made me want to give this place a 5star.  Another highlight is you can add toppings (like cheese, mushrooms, onions, etc.) to your hash browns, I added mushrooms and sauteed onions,  D E L I C I O U S!   Lastly, I could not go without mentioning Miriam who was taking care of our table ! She was hands down the best server I've ever met!   Highly recommend this place !",

It does get crowded. We were there on a Friday afternoon about 1 p.m. still  ordering breakfast. We were getting a late start.   Like I said the place is busy. Because we were pressed on time  I ordered what I thought would be quick.    2 eggs  Sunny Side Up medium, hash browns and wheat bread.  Hard to screw that up.  And yes, I enjoyed it.  The Charleston shrimp and grits looked scrumpious.  The grits came deep fried.  Never having that before I gave it a taste.  Nothing special. Not a fan of chicken pot pies, however, it smelled good.  I felt it was a bit salty for my taste.    Service is exceptionally well here. Staff is very attentive to your needs.  We needed extra plates to share, a bowl for some of the gravy.  Without saying anything, just from our body language, they knew and brought these things out.  Impressive.  They try to make your experience quite enjoyable and hope to have you returned soon.  And that we will.",

    "text": "I love eating breakfast foods, especially at non- breakfast hours. Metro Diner serves breakfast all day!    I haven't tried many chicken and waffles here in Vegas, buy I can definitely vouch that Metro Diner's chicken and waffles are pretty bomb. The fried chicken is super crunchy on the outside and in some magical way, glisteningly juicy on the inside. Our server, Tyler (?? sorry don't remember your name..), mixed syrup and Louisiana hot sauce in a separate little bowl for dipping. I am a fan of sweet and savory flavors, and dipping the fried chicken in that hot sauce syrup was . You can definitely enjoy the fried chicken on it's own, but the syrup makes it 10x better.  The waffles were by far, one of the best I've ever eaten. For one, they're cooked perfectly, crispy golden brown to all those waffle square edges; and two, the batter is light, so you're not eating a thick doughy cake, which I personally dislike. It's served with powdered sugar and strawberry butter, which I didn't think I would like because I hate strawberry flavored things (they taste too artificial). But I actually enjoyed the butter when eaten with everything.   Service was excellent. Our server sat us and took our drink order. Then another worker asked us if we've ordered drinks, we said yes. Then a few minutes later, another worker stopped by and asked if we ordered drinks. We didn't mind waiting, maybe 3-4 minutes for water, because we saw our server get 2 more tables, other than us and a 7 top. (She was getting all new tables at once) But the fact that the other workers noticed us, saw we did not get water, and came to ask if we had our drink orders taken was very attentive. It was nice to see teamwork. They all seem very personable.   Overall 5/5 for the chicken and waffles. And 5/5 for service. Aaaand, I must mention, portions are sharing portions.",

I stumbled into Metro Diner in Fayetteville, NC and fell in love with the best fried chicken ever (besides my dear Simba's RIP)!! Their chicken is seasoned and flavorful all the way to the bone. I was ecstactic to learn that they have TWO restaurants in Las Vegas and was lucky to step into the friendly service of manager Darla and excellent servers Dennis n Maria. Darla came to our table and we told her about our DELICIOUS experience in Fayetteville. She guaranteed the same here and she was 100% on the money!! We had their chicken dinner and returned the following morning for chicken and waffles...fanfriggintastic!! Darla is a credit to the company and Dennis is just as wonderful.

I got the lunch combo which included half a sandwich and a cup of soup. I got their broccoli and cheddar soup and it was on the chunky side so if you are expecting a Panera broccoli and cheddar soup then you will be disappointed. For my sandwich I got their chicken salad sandwich and it was very hearty with a lot of chicken. I like how the sauce wasn't runny and the sandwich was well put together.

Today was a repeat, Samir person , order was wrong .. and the same pleasant  apathy.  If you get her , take PTO, you'll  need the extra time.",

The waitress was very sweet, I am disappointed that I forgot her name (I'll be back). She greeted me upon entering and informed me that we are welcomed to seat ourselves. Upon finding the perfect table, she immediately came over to take the drink order. No waiting around for attention here! This customer service continued throughout the entirety of our meal.  On my particular visit, loaded baked potato soup was the soup of the day. And let me tell you - this soup is one hot potato! It was so good. I want more already! I originally planned to order biscuits & country gravy. The waitress was sweet enough to provide me with a sample of the country gravy prior to ordering. It was not my cup of tea...or soup, if we may. I opted out. I decided to take a chance on the fried chicken & waffles. And my oh my strawberry butter!!! The fried chicken was cooked to a golden perfection. Accompanied by a belgian waffle with strawberry butter and a sweet/spicy sauce for the chicken. I certainly did not expect to love this dish as much as I did. The portion was big enough to share.  Thank you for making my first visit a great one, Metro Diner. We'll be back soon!",

Small flairs give the diner food here character.  * FOOD: + The Chicken & Waffles were DAAAAAAANK + Chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. + Waffles were delicious, and not too heavy. + Strawberry butter was so good I asked if they sold it (no, but its actually really easy to make. Mix butter with blended strawberries and a dash of Grenadine).  * PRESENTATION: + I was expecting diner presentation and was pleasantly surprised. My Chicken & Waffles, while monstrously proportioned, was still aesthetic. The chicken looked crispy and delicious, while the strawberry butter contrasted nicely with the dark chicken skin and the light waffles.  * SERVICE: + Expect basic diner service.   * LOGISTICS: + Plenty of parking. + No wait on a Monday morning.",

All her recommendations were on point as well.  First off, they have quite an extensive menu plus some specials on the board against the wall so make sure to check that out too.  Also, I must say this place offers the best fried chicken in town! Just crunchy, juicy and very tasty. They actually serve it with sweet spicy sauce that makes it even better.   Lastly, per Kelly's recommendation, we ordered the banana foster cheesecake for dessert. Sweetness was just right and not too overwhelming. We definitely look forward to trying other stuff on their menu.",

My husband ordered the eggs dish and the eggs were delicious and fluffy. They cooked the bacon perfectly as well--the only downside was the toast which was so overly buttered that it was dripping out of the toast. Overall, decent but probably won't be returning.",

We walked in and the hostess was involved in something else, not a customer. To sit us she takes us to a booth by the bathroom, which I didn't like. There  were others tables available. The booth had not been cleaned and the floor was very slippery. I asked if we could sit somewhere else and she sat us in the front at a table we had passed earlier. This one not too clean either. The food was good but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth. Not sure if I would go back to this location.  They need to get it together! I don't remember seeing any bus boys. Hmmmm",

    "text": "Super fast service and food. Restaurant was packed, but we had our food in probably less than 10 mins from ordering, simple, home cooked inspired meals. My husband got the meatloaf and I got the shrimp and grits. He raved and cleaned his plate. I liked my dish ok, but it wasn't what I was expecting, I like traditional New Orleans style, but this was Charleston, smothered, basically drowning in a bland, white gravy almost soup. I fished out the shrimp which were cooked just right, and left the rest. It was so disappointing especially since my husband loved his meal so much and I could see all the other dishes coming out the kitchen looking amazing, next time I'm getting the fried chicken, but save yourself from heartache and pass on the shrimp and grits",

    "text": "Service was very good check on us regularly (otherwise would only have 2 stars), but the food was barely mediocre. Went with my wife for a brunch and she ordered cornbeef and hash with eggs, I  got the Philly cheese steak. I could tell the Philly was not grilled, but steamed like a french dip. It had a lot of meat which is good, but it only had cheeze. No green peppers or onions and, again, not grilled! The bread was fresh and tasted good and the fries were fine, but I wanted a Philly, not a French Dip Sandwich. This is a basic American sandwich! My wife's hash was mostly potatoes and very little hash. She could tell the eggs were low quality and not fresh (hard to get here in Vegas, but you can). They were cooked they way she wanted, just poor quality. Again, the service was very good and we were hungry, so didn't complain, but how are they going to change can-bought hash with too much potatoes or learn how to cook a Philly?? I would recommend going to Black Bear Dinner or Griddlecakes about half a mile away, both have much higher quality food for the same prices! Waiting for \"The Under New Management\" sign before I go back!",

They have an open kitchen with front row seating at the bar. You can see that the chefs are well trained and have a good flow of communication with the servers and the head chef \"Sunshine\" delegates tasks with a smile. I love seeing a good team in a restaurant since I've been in the industry for over 10 years. I know how hard it is to create that atmosphere with so many different personalities. Hillary was our server and was quick to great us, knowledgeable of the menu and provided amazing service. I can't wait to come back as this is mine and my boyfriends new and only breakfast spot. The only thing that bothered me was how far away my stool was from the counter, the seats aren't adjustable. That being my only complaint, which is a personal issue, doesn't effect the 5 stars",

Our waiter was extremely kind & he is not the reason I'm rating this place so low. The reason for my 2 star rating is because the food really just was not anything special. I paid $11+ for some mediocre pancakes that I found to be extremely dry, hash browns, sausage and eggs. For breakfast food such as this, that is way overpriced. My friend paid $12+ for corn beef hash. That is just insanity when \"egg works\" right down the road is like half the price and higher quality food. All of my friends love this diner & I can see that they love it because of the impeccable service but the food really just was not anything special at all.... Probably will not return here.",

Oh that might be because the cook is leaning over chatting with the server and I assume the manager. When a customer sees that and then gets half of what they ordered !  And then when the other half finally arrives ( meanwhile you have just about finished the first half because it took so long ) so the 2nd half arrives and WHAMO it's wrong!!  Maybe the cook should spend more time cooking and less time chatting with the help! Maybe! I would give zero stars if possible. I will say I was here in the afternoon last week for the first time and it was good fast and everything came cooked at the same time so I thought I would give breakfast a shot BIG MISTAKE. How does a restaurant go down so fast? Anyway rant is over and with all the great places to eat in Las Vegas I would pass on Metro Diner and go to maybe Mr Mama's instead.",

We are a party of 9 and we were seated promptly for a Friday night. It was about 730pm and the restaurant seemed only a third full. Bottom line, this place needs to train servers when it comes to customer service. Our server gave us attitude, didn't check on us, had no service and gave us another bad experience. If you are looking for a sit down place where you and your family can enjoy a nice meal, then this is not the place. Maybe this is why there are a lot of businesses that are doing the cafeteria style dining,  where you get in line and place your order on a machine and pay it right then and there. Hopefully this place gets better. Food was good except the fried chicken was way too salty.",

They had this amazing thing, strawberry butter... omg this was amazing! It was like strawberry ice cream on top of my waffles.  I will go back here JUST for that.  So completely forgot to mention I had chicken and waffles, at 2 in the afternoon... (something that's definitely hard to find), and my server Dario made a sauce for my chicken and let me know what everything was, he knew that menu so well, and it was so appreciative.  The food took less than 15 to come out, but it was during a time where there was only two other tables.  Regardless, it would be worth the wait to feel like your in a place where you feel welcomed and have a happy belly by the end of it. You'll be seeing me soon Metro Diner!",

    "text": "Came back in today for dinner.  Staff was great.  Greeted with a warm smile and my server was awesome and explained the specials and menu well and suggested the beef dip.  He recommended the Beef dip sandwich which my husband ordered with a side of macaroni and cheese.  My husbands beef dip sandwich was all fatty and very chewey.  He sent it back and opted for the chicken dinner which was ten times better.  I ordered the meat loaf which was kind of flavorless and it seemed the portion was much smaller then what I saw on diners drive ins and dives.  I guess I have to go to Florida to get the full treatment.  They took a lot off the menu like the stuffed blueberry French toast and the Pittsburgh sandwich.  :(. Wish they would bring them back on the menu.  For $41 dollars I guess i just expected the food to completely wow me and not still be hungry when we left.  With that being said next time I think I will try the breakfast instead of the dinner.  Maybe portions are bigger and breakfast will be on point because dinner was just okay.  Service was exceptionally better than yesterday.  Wish I would of got the young mans name and the hostess today was also very nice.  Will return one day for breakfast.",

I ordered a ham and cheddar sandwich with soup, however the lady I spoke to on the phone said they only had breakfast croissant sandwiches. This item is clearly on the menu, if you don't serve it why leave it on your menu. Perhaps the lady I talked to is unaware of the full menu. I ended up ordering the regular half sandwich with cheddar and broccoli soup.",

I'm thinking it was Autumn  the food was also so different compared to most brunch places, I even ordered extra food because my normal assumption is I won't get stuffed. I was full by my fries alone. Such great portions, you won't leave without your tummy completely stuffed! Not only that but while walking out every single person that worked there smiled and said \"thank you, have a wonderful day!\" It made us feel SO SO SO special. Truly is a new gem spot for my family and I. Thank you!",

    "text": "Gave this place one star because my boyfriend and I went in and ordered food to go last night. First off, the person taking the order didn't write the order down. Now I've been to restaurants where a few don't write orders down but they have pretty good memories and get the order right. This one however didn't and we had no idea u til we got home (15minutes away). He ordered a San Francisco Benny and ended up with the crab cake benny. On top of that, if it's your first time ordering from here, can't tell the difference until u bite into the food because the poached eggs and hollindaise sauce is on top. Well, not wanting to waste it since it was late and they'd close soon anyway, on top of being hungry, he ate it and the whole night he felt like s***. He got up throwing up every couple hours. Pretty bad food poisoning from that benny. I went in the following day to speak to the manager and although he said he could be refunded (I didn't have my bf's card n he was home resting, still feeling sh****), he did not seem apologetic one bit. I was left at the lobby area for a few minutes under the impression that he'd come back and call my bf for the card number so he could refund him. And while I was waiting, the two hostesses didn't ask if I still needed help. It wasn't until one of the servers came by that I said something. Very disappointing experience. Now I don't even trust they'll call and give us a refund. I don't even care about the refund but it's the principle that matters to me.",

The first impression was great: staff was extremely friendly and the wait time wasn't bad for a Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately, that's where the good part of the review ends. Our waitress seemed uninterested and lost. Yes, it was a busy Saturday morning but customer service skills are still important. I ordered pancakes with strawberries, which I thought would be delicious. Instead, it seemed that someone tried to cook whole strawberries in the pancakes (yikes) which resulted in the pancakes not being fully done. The eggs were also extremely funny. My mother enjoyed her croissant sandwich but we both agreed there was no flavor whatsoever in any of the food.  I would try this place again when it's dead because it seems that the food isn't good when they are busy. At least my toast, hash browns and bacon were good!",

A 1/2lb burger that's served between two grilled cheese sandwiches, topped with bacon, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise!  This is a meat lovers dream!  I'd be wrong to not mention just how lovely the entire wait staff is at Metro!

    "text": "Braaaand new and apparently with other new locations in vegas area coming too. Came in on a Saturday afternoon they opened only last Monday. Surprisingly there were other customers visiting and a lot of employees still being trained. It has that retro diner look like johnny rockets or norms. The waiter was very attentive, a little overwhelmingly attentive probably because there wasn't much else for him to do. I had taken maybe three sips of my coffee and came back twice after I told him I didn't need a refill yet if I wanted more coffee. So I just gave in lol   Their menu is expansive the have their omlettes, pancakes and waffles, basic breakfast plates, burgers, sandwiches served all day so it can take a bit to decide. I chose the pot roast and it's actually really good. I'd go back for it. The meat was tender and the broth it comes in was perfect, the mashed potatoes too. It was all well seasoned and not too salty or bland and flavorful to the perfect level. The portions are also huge enough to save for two meals.   My friend ordered an omelette and he said it was still a bit undercooked on the center and the salsa they used he can tell was from the jar so he was a little disappointed about that . But he did praise their raspberry tea because it tasted like real fresh tea.",

They are famous for this chicken and waffles. I did not have the chicken and waffles but it looked amazing. I had the club sandwich and it was great. Two types of cheese, ham and turkey with bacon. It was mammoth in size and I got a heaping pile of fries.  My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and it looked mouth watering. I will get it next time.  The service was on point. Attentive yet not overbearing. Just enough attention to ensure you get what you need and drinks stay refilled.",

The meatloaf had a mushy consistency on the inside and I wasn't sure if it was under cooked. The outside with the slight sear tasted decent. It came with mashed potatoes that were tasty.   The Cajun Pasta was terrible. It looked like they threw in shredded bits of chicken and some stale brown sauce that was extremely over salted and was inedible. Even the Pasta was over cooked and soggy. However, The server was kind enough to notice and the manager took it off the bill.  I was really hoping this could be a go to diner spot for me since it's relatively close by and in a convenient location, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be coming back.",

While we were there enjoying our Crab Cake Benedict (with crispy scattered hash browns) & Eggs & Corned beef hash, we saw every server helping every other server with every table. There was none of the \"not my station\" crap you hear at some restaurants. Javier was serving, sweeping, cleaning, wiping, stocking stuff. You name it, he was doing it...along with all the other servers. Thanks to Javier, Darla, and the entire staff at Metro Diner on Rainbow for an amazing experience! I'll be telling everyone I know this place is a MUST!!",

The onion rings we ordered in the side where crisp but without sacrificing the flavor of the onion.  I got the mushroom and Swiss burger, which was also great and full of flavor, even if I'm not a big fan of the bun.  Topped it off with their house salad and ranch dressing.  Some places ranch is usually a miss but Metro has some amazing ranch.   Last shout out to our server Madison.  Very super sweet and incredibly attentive.

Ok so I had ordered the croissant cinnamon French toast, a chicken biscuit and side of their sausage gravy. Really?? That biscuit was hard as a rock! I sent it back and got another rock hard biscuit! Not once did our server ask me if my new biscuit was any better! It was off to the side and he could plainly see that I was not happy and just didn't give a rats a$$. My friends eggs were way under cooked but he ate his way around it! Sad! What a waste of $55 at this horrible place! The jerk face manager care by and asked how every single thing was BUT my biscuit! So I said yeah your biscuits are hard and dry and no good! And I should've told him his chicken was just the same! I ate the chicken because I was so darn hungry! The sausage gravy was very bland with zero flavor, tasted like milky flour! Disgusting!!!! My boyfriend luckily ordered cinnamon roll pancakes that were ok and nice of him to share. $3.99 2 pieces of dry, over cooked, bland bacon was ridiculous. Everything about this place is horrible. From their service, to their food, up onto their management! Oh and then they even tried to give me 2 biscuits to go! Hahahaha!!!!! Really?! What a joke!!!! I want a refund from this place!!!!! Awful!!!!! I'm so pissed!!!!!!",

Let's start from the beginning I came here with a party of five and was told the wait would be about 15 minutes no big deal. About 35 minutes later we were shown to this tiny booth that wasn't wiped down that would be fine for four people not five. Not wanting to wait any longer I saw five seats at the counter so I said that would do. The waitress service was excellent she was super efficient and nice. The food was hit and miss. I had the San Francisco egg sandwich and it was perfect. The grits were instant and not that great.  My daughter had the loaded fruit waffle the waffle was good but there was not a lot of fruit. The manager could see I was somewhat annoyed at the entire experience and he came over and apologized and gave me two certificates worth 14 dollars each on a future trip to the restaurant. He also brought out more fruit for the waffle. Due to the managers positive action I'll definitely come back and give Metro Diner another try and hopefully it lives up to their average 4.5 star review on yelp.",

The pork tenderloin sandwich was breaded but served with a bunch of other stuff far from what you get in the Midwest which is more of a basic plain sandwich.  Served on a Texas toast type bun the sandwich was ok.  Fries seemed to lack salt but an abundance of black pepper.  Overall it's just an average spot. Nice staff but food seemed average. May try it again and try something different next time  Pastrami was just average nothing special not real big not real small didn't have a lot of  flavor to it.",

And the place was buzzing...It is a breakfast, lunch and dinner all of the time kind if place. The greeting was lovely and the service was exceptional throughout!  The food coming out of the kitchen looked ridiculously amazing...And, there is a menu, that is crazy looking delicious.  You may want to check out their fried chicken something (waffles, dinner, etc.). Or The, Hash and/ eggs benedict. Hash browns are crispy and look super delicious.  So, what happened with us was that my husband ordered the fish and chips. And I Had the specialty Pastrami with egg on top sandwich. (That was an amazing sandwich with fresh baked bread.  However, I think, Metro Diner missed the mark with the Fish and Chips because they used the Suewi fish(sp) instead of a traditional bass or halibut. Maybe catfish.  I had a taste and thought it was too mushy and a bit muddy for this dish!    However, the manager came by really prompt and was  gracious and personable.  Otherwise, you bet! Give this place a try.....I think you all would love it! Great Job Metro Diner!  Rene'e Weathers Las Vegas",

    "text": "Used to working at five star resorts, my roommate and I are trained to give (and spot) exceptional service, and that's exactly what we found at Metro Diner. Even the extremely reasonable 25 minute wait for Sunday brunch was enjoyable in their outdoor space equipped with complimentary coffee.  Gone is the faulty pen-and-pad method of yesteryear. The wait staff here are equipped with iPads that send orders directly to the kitchen. From our seats, we could see behind the counter where the kitchen operated like smooth, Swiss-engineered clockwork. Our food came out hot, fresh, and faster than we could have expected. I highly recommend the pound cake French Toast--but as dessert, rather than an entree!  The meal itself was sublime: delicious diner food, made with fresh ingredients and in generous portions. The service, however, is where Metro really shines. Though the restaurant was packed, we were greeted, seated, and fed in record time. Even our water glasses were kept magically full as if by wonderful, friendly diner fairies.  We've all been to restaurants where servers cater only to their designated sections, and felt ignored when we need help but nobody nearby was assigned to us. Not so at Metro Diner. Every employee who passed by our table here stopped to ask how we were doing, and seemed genuinely interested in the answer.  Metro Diner gives their employees the flexibility to take care of guests instead of following rigid, micromanaged procedures--which can feel insincere and inefficient. When the server dropping off our food realized we had made a sub (home fries instead of hash browns), she brought a replacement in under three minutes, without having to consult the server who took our order, get approval from a manager, or otherwise jump through hoops to make things right.  I don't have a single complaint. Metro Diner exceeded my expectations in every way. Bravo!",

It was like baked dog food, only not as good.   Today we came for breakfast. I ordered the breakfast pie (their specialty), Mike had biscuits and gravy.   We waited 35 minutes (literally). When our food arrived it was obvious that Mike's food had been sitting. His eggs and hash browns were cold and there was a gross film over his biscuits and gravy.   I ordered bacon with mine, but I didn't get it. You'd think after waiting for so long they could've at least served me some improperly cooked bacon.   The manager came over with her bullshit apology. It was inauthentic and patronizing.   I've seen the reviews on Yelp, the owner's mother must have written them, because anyone who's ever been to a restaurant in Vegas could tell that this place sucks.",

My family and I arrived around 11am to have a brunch together. I was immediately surprised by the selections of food I had to choose from. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long which was a huge plus for me. I'm not a big breakfast person so this place was off to a good start in my books.   I give this place 4 stars for the lack of service and bland taste. I ordered the Avocado Toast which may explain the bland taste but the service was missing. I absolutely loved the guy that served us but we were handed off a few times which made it confusing when we were trying to order with someone. When we did place our order another person would come up and ask what we wanted and we would have to explain that we already ordered with someone else. I loved the servers but it seemed a little unorganized.   Overall it was a pleasant visit for my family and I. I will be back to update my review to see if this day was just a one off.",

I'm a VERY picky eater on top of being a vegetarian so finding a place that we both agree on isn't always easy. Everything here was seriously amazing! Idk which was better, the food or the service. Metro Diner is definitely going to be our new regular place. Our server Darla was beyond perfect and I highly recommend her to everyone!!",

The portions are very large and the food is definitely good. They have call ahead seating as well! Call before so you aren't waiting for forever.   **update** I super appreciate the manager Tony reaching out and letting me know about the turkey options. I will definitely be going back to give it a try!",

Every time I'm there, I forget that I'm in the Sin City but rather, at a small town where everyone knows each other.   The first time I visited, I got a burger with mac and cheese with it. Deliciously sinful filled with flavorful seasoning along with it. Along with that, the texture from all ingredients made it a delicious meal. At the same time, my girlfriend got the Philly Cheese Sandwich to which she was very happy about. The buns were just right with a generous amount of meat along with it. A must try.   The second time we visited, I got their famous meatloaf to which delivers in taste. Wow. I've never been a huge fan of such an entree but I've changed my mind. Along with its sides like the mashed potatoes and vegetables, it was an amazing meal over all. This is not and overstatement, you have to order their meatloaf. My girlfriend, on the other hand, got the hashed corned beef with a side of two poached eggs. Wow. Pair the two together and it heightens the entree. Definitely a must try as well.   My favorite from my visits there are their amazing cobblers. Topped with a classically-made ice cream and this dessert is the epitome of all sweets.",

If you come here without trying the chicken waffles, did you really try Metro Diner? Lol! The chicken was so good and satisfying. The crunchy skin and the flavor was just all there. Plus, the strawberry butter went well with the meal. (Of course I asked for extra haha) Make sure they make their special sauce for any chicken dish, which is basically the syrup and Louisiana hot sauce mixed together.  The other dish we got was the SMOTHERED CHICKEN, which is on their daily special. It was okay (not as good as the chicken and waffles). It's chicken tenders smothered in melted cheese with some sauteed veggies.   The service: our server was so funny! & knowledgeable. I think his name was Philip. But he helped us with picking our order and he was so attentive   Overall, great experience. We'll be back again",

Mind you, it was DEAD inside - just like me after leaving this place completely disappointed by the lack of customer service. I walk in, tell a host/hostess or waiter that I'd like to order for take out and then they disappear. For 10+ minutes. I don't understand. Where the F*&%$ do they go? This last time, I was about to walk out and the waiter finally comes out and says, \"oh have you been helped already?\" So I tell him why I'm upset and that it's the 2nd time this has happened to me. And I hate to be Karen who asks for the Manager - but he offered me the business card of the restaurant manager, it was sitting on the hostess podium stand. It's too bad, because I really love their food. I hope they get their s#!$ together",

This time we had the Spicy Honey Chicken Biscuit, the Metro Pancake, and the Fried Chicken & Waffle. Their fried chicken is honestly the best thing I've had here. It's perfectly crispy and mouthwatering both in the fried chicken and waffle and with the spicy chicken biscuit. I've had better biscuits and waffle elsewhere, but still pretty good. The strawberry sauce that comes with the waffle really compliments the whole dish. When it comes to the pancake, I was impressed by fluffiness and the size of it. If you're craving a big fluffy pancake, this is the place to go. This is a great local place to go if you're craving a hearty American breakfast.",

The fried chicken is awesome and the best part is, I always have enough leftover for tomorrow (double bonus). But my favorite item has to be the meatloaf. I usually hate meatloaf - either it's dry, has too many spices, or tastes too \"meaty.\" But this meatloaf is moist, seasoned well and filling! I initially only tried it because my husband ordered it and raved about it. Now it's one of my go-tos.  I've also had breakfast and lunch there - both of which were good, not great. So for me, dinner is where it's at. My only complaint is, there are no refills on their flavored iced tea :(  Service is always excellent, friendly staff and very accommodating!",

I went for it given it was the most popular dish on the menu.  So glad I did! The chicken was cooked to perfection and waffles were light and fluffy, not too dense. Amazing strawberry butter with actual strawberries. This meal was made complete with pumpkin spice coffee.  So good.   Service was also on point - Kelly was attentive and kind.   Will be back for this exact meal.",

    "text": "Metro Diner has become a staple of my weekly Friday ritual with my son. We found Metro Diner a couple months ago and after driving by several times visiting family on that side of town we decided to try it... NOT REGRETTED! Metro Diner has an atmosphere like any other, it has an at home family feel that you cannot find anywhere else in our valley. I have to admit I've not tried anything except for breakfast but I am guilty of not branching out! You cannot go wrong with the croissant French toast! Strawberry butter is Metro's sweet gift to the world and has quickly become a guilty pleasure of mine. Bring an appetite because the portions are massive. They always have a good variety of specials with a twist... flavored tea and coffee available.... they have an open kitchen so you can see exactly what is going on. Their are counter seats available if that's up to speed for you. Not personally my taste. now the service... our first time eating at the restaurant we were quickly greeted by the sweetest server, Allie! (Ally, Alley? Sorry) She is a ray of sunshine who helped us found exactly what we wanted. and each week will greet us even when she is not our server! Her sweet smile and spunky spirit kept us coming back every week........She is a highlight and has been on point with every visit. Each time we dine in, multiple servers will check in on us... manager visits to the table. This place has a great system. As long as the doors are open metro Diner will be a part of our week! Hard to find good breakfast and better yet, good hospitality! If you are reading this review, go to metro Diner!",

I was fine with that,  then the amazing hostess named Jhenell told me she is working on it. I watched her do her magic and she was getting everyone who was waiting seated within 10 minutes. She then told me and my party of 10 it will be in 2 minutes and she would have a table for us. She was True to her word. She is amazing and a valuable person in my book. The food was great and the service continued from start to finish was awesome.  I highly recommend this place",

She was sweet, helped explain the menu and gave me the most amazing Bavarian chocolate coffee ever. We came Thursday at 10am, and were able to get a table right away. The timing of everything was great, from ordering to refills to food arriving. I got the San Francisco Benedict, hubby got the biscuit and gravy meal and we shared the cinnamon roll pancakes. My Benedict was cooked to perfection, right amount of golden liquid and perfectly poached eggs. The 5 star was def the hashbrowns. Most places hashbrowns are undercooked, but these bad boys had the best crispy exterior and perfectly cooked inside. The cinnamon roll pancakes were great and massive, it also came with warm syrup. Biscuits and gravy were solid, my homemade recipe is better but this is a close second. We will be back. And we are SO glad they dont have one in centennial because my hubs and I would be 500 lbs.",

Dad complained so hard about how his meal was awful when he went so I just never had an inkling to ever go.   Nor sure what happened to him but I had a fantastic experience. Got the chicken and waffles (of course) best damn chicken I've had outside of being  cooked at a southern black family reunion.    Put Soul Food Cafe to shame. They should be ashamed of themselves if a place called Metro Diner know how to get it harder than they do.   Dont let the unassuming simple diner style fool you, they know how to wreck and I happily signed my check. I will definitely be returning.",

We went on a Sunday about 11:00 AM, there was a 25 minute wait for a party of 2. The hostess was super friendly and greeted  us immediately.  We waited about 15 minutes and she asked if we would like to sit at the counter as there were 2 seats available. We agreed and had a pleasant experience watching the cooks work very hard and quickly to serve the customers. Service was fast and efficient! I had the San Francisco Benedict and 1/2 waffle instead of hash browns. My husband had the breakfast sandwich! Everything was amazing! We will definitely go back for our next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "This is our go-to breakfast spot in Vegas and we're here just about every weekend despite the fact that we live in CA. It's the hubb's favorite because 'they've perfected hash browns' (wth?!) - gotta love my simple guy but his take just doesn't do this place justice.  They've got unique menu options and specials that you just don't find at other places (check their menu out & you'll see what I mean), especially diners, and their portions are HUGE!    Their chicken & waffles is absolutely scrumptious!!! Not only is it too much to consume in a single sitting, more importantly, it surprisingly rivals Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in So Cal (which is a favorite & must for me when in So Cal), but for different reasons. That homemade strawberry butter is HEAVEN on fluffy waffles; coupled with their unique mustard brined something or other juicy fried chicken - it's the perfect combo of sweet & salty but not too salty (yes mustard, which I avoid & was skeptical about - but it doesn't taste mustardy & gives it its own unique flavor).  And I didn't even add OR NEED TO add the sweet & spicy sauce that comes with it (I don't do condiments or spicy...I know I know, what a bland existence).  For a healthier option, their avocado toast is refreshing chunky avocado spread with fresh tomato quarters on multigrain toast - simple, light yet tasty as well as filling. It inspired me to make it at home, which for some reason is only a close second.  Or if you're lucky enough to order it & breakfast desert is your thing (like my son) - try the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. Sweet mother of tastebuds!! Delicious & fluffy buttery pancake sweetness with crunchy caramel walnut overload!!  Everything sounds & looks good from their menu, I want to try to all but have so enjoyed what I've ordered in the past, it's hard not to order those items again.  Maybe one of these days we'll actually try their lunch or dinner options.  This place is popular & fills up fast but they're great about getting you seated & served quickly, and they have an outdoor patio with heaters as well. Service has always been excellent with the manager making his rounds just to check on you. Your server takes your order on an iPad & sends it right to the cook while standing in front of you - how's that for fast?  An when you're ready to pay, you do so with your server again through the iPad - super fast & convenient.  My not-so-perfect comments/observations:  1. Yes, the ladies bathroom is a bit messy (not gross or nasty though) more often than not; and  2. On my last visit I was seated facing the cooks. I couldn't help but notice & wonder why the cook wasn't wearing a hair net despite having a really great fro. I kept wondering if I should be checking my food for hair when I receive it (I have long curly hair & know for a fact curly hair falls out like you wouldn't believe). Note to manager: he's got a really great fro but please make him wear a hair net so I don't need to counsel myself. Thank you. Keep serving up deliciousness. That is all.",

I never heard of this dish before so I had to find a place that made it in Las Vegas. When I did the search here on Yelp, I was so happy Meteo popped up! I had an excuse to come back.   Never had to wait for a seat and the server was so kind. I ordered the Crab Benedict with a side of Cheesy Grits. My husband ordered Biscuits and Gravy. Our food arrives and I notice I had ham on my muffin. I moved it to the side, because I thought that was a weird combination to put with Crab. Then I noticed no Crab.. She gave me the wrong Benedict.    We let her know and she was so apologetic about it and said another one will be out shortly. While I waited I just ate my husbands food lol. The gravy was soooo flavorful, you could drink it.   After mine arrived, I tore into it like a caveman. It was so delicious and I saved some for tomorrow morning. I love boxes lol.   Everything was great here and we are looking forward to a 3rd time.   FYI. I noticed you don't have crepes on the menu... I hope this can be changed in the future! Crepes are amazing.",

    "text": "Metro is a solid diner- I pop in solo, snag a seat at the bar, and watch the cook make my food hot and fresh. The service puts this business above others in that they are attentive almost to a fault. My server will help me and nearly every other server who walks by will check my water, ask how I'm doing, or suggest dishes if I'm still looking at a menu. It's unreal, in a great way!  Always check the black board for specials- a recent crab cake benedict was bomb, but the stuffing waffle Thanksgiving special wsa most memorable. It's one of those places where you can't really go wrong. Somehow I haven't managed to try many of the dinner dishes, but I love that you can have meatloaf for breakfast or scrambled eggs for dinner, because it's all available all the time!",

You cant go wrong ordering anything at this restaurant. Not only is the food good but the server here is also very friendly and nice. Especially the manager or the owner he's very accommodating. We usually sit with our service dog in the patio. One weekend when we came to the patio it was completely full. He asked one of the table if they would like to move inside so we can sit in the patio with our service dog which they did willingly since they originally wanted a table inside anyway. They will go out of their way to try to accommodate their customers. Food is good service is great what more can you ask for?",

Met the managing owner briefly and all employees were concerned in making our visit pleasant and delicious. Fully successful!  Jan J",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place since it's down the street from our house. Server (forget her name) was friendly, no major issues there.   I'm not a breakfast person, and the lunch and dinner items left very little for vegetarians. Basically, a grilled cheese or an avocado wrap. No option for a veggie patty or vegetable sandwich. I ordered the \"avocado wrap\" with the black beans on the side, with the side dish being \"steamed vegetables\". My guy ordered fried chicken and waffles.   The wrap came out mostly spinach, was missing the fried jalapenos, missing the chipotle ranch, and only had 2 small slices of avocado. Barely any cheese. The black beans that were originally supposed to go in the wrap, was brought to me in a 2 oz ramekin. I assumed the side of steamed vegetables would be an assortment of veggies, but was only zucchini and squash. They did taste good, just not what I expected. I asked our server about the missing ingredients in my wrap and she said she would get a manager. Took a while for said manager to come out. I didn't ask for her, the server just told her to come speak to us. Manager told me the wrap only comes with half an avocado for the entire thing (it's a sizable wrap), but she would put extra for me this time. Seriously? If the focus of the dish is avocado as advertised, there should be a decent amount. They must have really small avocados, based on what came out the first time. After some time, the manager brought me a new wrap (with double all the ingredients, which I didn't request, but was appreciated) and said my side of veggies would be out soon, but was forgotten. By this point, my guy was almost done eating so I had a few bites of the wrap and asked for a to go box. I gave up on getting the vegetables, which our server brought to me as she brought my to go box, because, according to her, she asked around who's veggies they were and no one claimed them so she figured out they were mine. I ended up taking home the majority of my food to eat at home. The wrap was good, but that was with extra ingredients requested by the manager. My guy said his food tasted good and was a large portion, but the chicken was more breading than meat. One star for a friendly server, the other star for the wrap tasting good, but only after doubling up on the ingredients. For my avocado wrap, his fried chicken and waffles, 2 ice waters and a glass of milk, $28.00. Likely, won't return.",

We totally found metro diner on accident and it was one of the best food finds we had all week. It worked out because we didn't want to be stuck eating strip food or buffet. We went in for breakfast and had a basic eggs and hash browns breakfast with a side of biscuits and gravy because we never get that at home. We were so impressed with the food quality and customer service we decided to return every day for breakfast, trying something new each time.   On our second day of breakfast with some yo halla halla and croissant French toast we were even more impressed, our wonderful server told us that it was a chain and started in Jacksonville. Which made us super happy being from the east coast. After looking on the website we found a location an hour away from home ok the east coast.   This place had the best breakfast and customer service and we look forward to visiting the ones on the east coast!!!",

Let me say everyone does not know how to cook grits these where like my mom made them.  Nice and thick with just the right butter and salt.  My son had the waffles and eggs and he was a happy camper.  My friend had the chicken and waffles!  MY God it was a side of chicken on the plate.  I will be back soon.......

I tasted my husband's biscuits and gravy which were seasoned perfectly and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Lots of sausage in the gravy too, not light on the meat.  My favorite thing was the home fries.  Javi explained that they use red potatoes and boil them and then do a quick deep fry.  They were perfection.     If you are hungry don't pass this place up!",

I ordered the meatloaf which comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a side of grilled veggies (really good!). I couldn't believe my mom just ordered a Belgium waffle, she has been begging me to take her here for weeks, and now that they are open she orders something I can make at home. She said it was really good, she said the meatloaf was good, but she can make better... haha that's my mom for ya. She got a peach cobbler to go and said it would take a week to finish it, she polished that sucker off in two days.  The pricing is bit high but the food is really good.",

We came in for a late brunch before heading back to California( where we're from). I got the Bissell Breakfast and boy was the amount I got filling. It is a traditional 2 eggs breakfast that I got with bacon, hash browns , sourdough toast and pancakes. Sooooo fulllll.  My husband got the Monte Cristo which almost made me regret getting a traditional breakfast. I got to take a bite and omg, we now know where to come to get a amazing Monte Cristo when visiting Vegas. We WILL return next time we are visiting Vegas and travel away from the stop just for this place. Our server, Kelly R, was wonderful and attentive. While most of our interactions were with her, the rest of the staff also seems really nice as well. We would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a delicious diner a little ways off strip. It is worth the trip!!!!",

The other night, we decided we wanted to return, and realized with a start that the other location had moved! We let our heart rates return to normal after realizing they had simply moved rather than shut down, and decided to pay the new location a visit. We were absolutely not disappointed, as everything was just as great as I remembered. Our server was John, and from the beginning he was funny, personable, and attentive. I would return just because of him, even if the food hadn't been top notch, (which it was, no worries there). I can't wait for payday so we can visit again!",

Don't be fooled by the plate size. I tried the meatloaf and it didn't look it was going to fill me up but it did. The gravy is good and the vegetables were amazing!... the tables are a bit small if you have a big group or kids in high chairs (we had 2). The service isn't bad but I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 cause I believe the prices are a little high for what you get.",

    "text": "So at breakfast/diner type places, I always have trouble deciding between the biscuits and gravy and the eggs benedict because I love both (What can I say? I love saucy eats!). When I mentioned this to the super helpful and friendly server, he said that there was an item not on the menu that combined both. It's called the southwest benedict and it is biscuits and gravy with sausage patties and a poached egg on top. It was exactly what I wanted and it combined the best of both worlds. The biscuits are made in house and they aren't anything to write home about, but they were decent. The sausage gravy was delicious, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the sausage patty went perfectly with everything else. In some ways, it's like a fancy breakfast sandwich (think sausage and egg biscuit sandwich with gravy on top), which made me very happy. There's also something called home fries, which is cut up red potatoes parboiled and then deep fried. They were simple, but oh so delicious. It didn't have any special seasoning (maybe a bit of salt?), but maybe it's because they make them there, it was really good. Overall, it was a lovely meal, and if I want a good breakfast for a decent price (not Las Vegas strip prices), I will come back here.",

    "text": "Normally I really love this place. I've been coming since they opened this location. But today, today I'm beyond disappointed. It started with whomever answered the phone, they hung up on me, when I called back and informed him I needed to place an order and he had just hung up on me he was not apologetic at all just put me on hold and someone else got on the phone. Fast forward to picking up my order, the host was welcoming and kind but the lady that brought my order did not give me a receipt AND she short changed me. When I noticed I was missing change the host went to tell the other lady then came back with a dollar. Being the honest person I am I explained that was more than I was owed, I paid $40 my total was $34 plus change (I don't know bc I wasn't given a receipt) and she gave me just $5 back, so I should have some coins not all dollar bills. I asked if they were going to do things the correct way and the girl that brought my order says \"they don't keep loose change\" funny considering it's a place of business you should always make sure you have exact change. It really baffles me how they tried to shortchange me without explanation. I've never had this issue before and I hope not to have it again.  *UPDATE: got home and my food was a MESS. There was gravy dripping from the side of the container, the bag and other container were covered in gravy. I got a partial biscuit (part of the top was missing) and it was soggy from being thrown on top of the veggies and gravy. EXTREMELY disappointed and I WILL NOT be returning to what used to be my favorite cheat meal.",

    "text": "I was torn between the highly regarded biscuit and gravy dish and a bacon, egg and cheese croissant so I ordered both. The biscuits and gravy were okay...ginormous, but did not have that buttermilk, southern-style taste I was looking for. Also, I did not like that they were drenched in gravy and sitting in a massive pool of it. Why not drizzle some gravy on the biscuits and then put some on the side to enable the customer to add more if they want to? I returned the dish to the waitress. As for the croissant sandwich, if it wasn't for the bacon, it would've been bland as hell. I expected them to butter and lightly fry each side of the croissant prior to assembling the sandwich to add buttery cheesy goodness, but they did not do that which made it a below average experience. Strike 3 was dessert. I ordered the peach cobbler and received a extremely sweet peach crumble/crisp as big as my face. Although the service extended was good, with disappointment on top of disappointment, I couldn't wait to leave. I won't be returning however if you want to try this place and you're particular about your food like I am, let them know how you want your dishes prepared in advance.",
