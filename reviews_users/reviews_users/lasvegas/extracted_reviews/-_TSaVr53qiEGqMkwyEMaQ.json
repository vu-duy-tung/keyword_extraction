I had a salad thing with chicken and white white sauce and spicy carrots. Other things were extra one dollar. I didn't know what they were so I didn't get them. Customer service was good. The chips were great. I would go back for the chips for sure. The food was okay. I'm just not used to that kind of food???? Next time I'll try falafel instead of chicken. They closed at 9 and I couldn't even tell. We didn't feel rushed at all to leave. :) thanks guys, I'll be back",

Very generous with portions, we couldn't even finish ours! Wife did not like the baklava but that's just cause it's not her cup of tea, I however thought it was delicious! Definitely stop by for a cheap filling meal!",

To think I could've been coming here and getting one of their delicious salads for the same price! Omg. I had the chicken salad and couldn't decide on what dressing so she gave me a sample of each. That made the salad Bc I love sauces and options. I alternated between the 3. Great flavor! Great value. Great service.",

We ordered the Chicken Kabob plate (4/5) the Steak Schwarma (1/5), Parsley fries (4/5), tzasiki (3/5) and hummus (3/5) and Baklava (5/5). It's not that it was bad....it was just meh.. With the exception of The Steak Shwarm-they should rename it overcooked splinters of fatty meat that fell through the grill grates. Horrible. The tzasiki and hummus are strictly a matter of my personal taste...but there was a light at the end of the tunnel and that was the baklava! D-lish! I will also note that we ordered delivery so maybe this was the reason the fries were soggy and lukewarm though my Dad liked them. Sadly I believe in my book-this is a one and done....many other Med places that are better in my opinion.",

    "text": "After eating holiday food for 2 weeks, mostly sweets & high-fat fare, I was craving a fresh, healthy meal. Thank you Yelpers for turning me on to Parsley. And thank you Groupon for offering me a good deal.   It's New Year's Day lunch & this place is pretty busy with a nice healthy vibe. Quite a few folks eating outdoors, large to-go orders heading out the door & always a couple people in line waiting to order. Maybe these customers have been ignoring good food, too, & have made resolutions?  This was my first time here & it was fun because Groupon \"made me\" get $16 worth of food-way more than I'd normally order. I ordered the Falafel Plate ($7.99) which came with 6 nice size falafel patties, salad, rice, a pita & tzatziki sauce. The falafel was delicious, as good as any I've ever had, & so was the chunky sauce. Salad was fresh as can be & plentiful & included chickpeas for a nice touch. I was asked if I wanted more of any of the ingredients added (no charge) & I added more tomato & cucumber. I also ordered a side of taboulli (or shall I just call it \"parsley\" because there was almost no bulgar to be found) & one of falafel ($3.99 each side). I think next time I'll just order a side of falafel with a couple of $1 toppings. (See my falafel pic.)   So the food was good but the ordering was just a bit complicated for the first time, trying to figure out what is what & what goes with what. (Like the Bowl & Plate are exactly the same except how they're arranged on the plate. Really?) The set-up is like Chipotle's but with lots more decisions to be made.  After placing my order I got caught up in looking at all the food toppings & mix-ins & sides & before I realized it 10-15 minutes had passed without my food in sight. I had originally figured the frying of the falafel was responsible for the delay so I asked & they asked me to repeat my order. How could they forget about someone in a line-up like Chipotle's? They did. I was feeling like a road block for the people behind me who had to pass me to get their food before me.  I'll definitely go to Parsley again but I won't get the taboulli nor a meal that includes that rice.  Lots of seating inside & out.",

The wrap was delish and HUGE! The bowls and the wrap were sooo big that we ate them for lunch the next day! OH, and the baklava was really, really delish!

Must've just caught them on a bad day the first time I went. The good is light and fresh and super tasty.   Just got a chicken kabob bowl to go for lunch. I have mixed feelings about my bowl. The flavor of the chicken kabobs is amazing and the bowl is light, fresh and healthy. My only problem with this is that my chicken was undercooked. When I got there and ordered the lady said I'd have to wait 10 to 15 minutes because the kabobs are made to order and I was find with that. I waited about that amount of time until she called me up to build my bowl. When I got home I took one bite and felt rubbery uncooked chicken in the center of one of the chicken cubes. I went through and shredded them all to see which ones were edible and ended up throwing away about half which was unfortunate because I was hungry. I'll probably go back because the flavor was great but just be aware that you have to make sure they're fully cooked. In the future I might ask them to cut them up when they take them off the kabob so they can see if the center of the chicken cubes are done.",

I get hummus, eggplant, grape leaves, tabbouleh, and switch the 5th item for something different each time.   Oh almost forgot -- they have a groupon!! Must get 24hrs beforehand, but worth it.   If you're wondering if you should try here, you won't be disappointed.   -1 star because some cooked items aren't great, but thankfully they let me order as side item and I only got a little.",

I was patiently waiting in line to order when a family of at least 4 walked in, cut into the line and began ordering, to which the staff did not seem phased by at all. When it came time to place my order, a chicken bowl, the server was slow, seemed to prioritize refilling the half full bins of tzaziki and lettuce over completing my dish. Similarly all staff seemed to move slowly and very disorganized. As noted above, the food was ok and the portions were fairly large, however, mostly consisted of chopped lettuce. Moreover, very little is actually included in your dish, as pretty much all the usual fixings are additional $1 extra, including hummus, babaganoush, olives, grapes leaves etc. The only things that were not extra was the dressing, cucumbers and tomatoes. I would consider going elsewhere for the price and better service.",

This review is not based on their food but their service (or lack of)    It's Monday around 2:30pm, the line is not super long, there's three people out front (2 servers, one male and one female)  I was behind one guy that wants to sample the chicken curry, the female server is helping him.  The male server was helping someone in front of him at the time.  There's a lady waiting behind me.  When the male server was done, I don't know how this happened but it did, he skipped over me and went to ask the lady behind me \"how can I help you?\"   I was in shock, and didn't say anything at the time because I can't believe what just happened.  Did this guy really skipped over me?  Sure the lady behind me is beautiful, does it mean they serve beautiful people first here?  I waited and see if he would notice his mistake, I'm standing right next to the lady.  Sure enough, nothing from him.  When the female server is done, she clearly sees me waiting  and ask what can she get for me.  At this point, I asked the male server \"Did you just skipped me?\"  Then he finally goes \"Oh sorry, I didn't see you there\"  Seriously, how in the world you didn't see me?  I was so steamed up at that point I rushed out the door.    I don't think I'll ever coming back to this place, it's a shame they do have a good chicken curry.",

All of the food is beautifully fresh. I recommend adding spicy carrots to the falafel wrap.  Vegan and vegetarian options, they're happy to accommodate and let me know what's what. It's always nice when they treat your dietary needs with care. Some of my crew has obligations and commitments, and during my 3-week stretch living on West Tropicana, Parsley provided a uniquely good opportunity to meet for lunch, where a veg can be a veg (others can eat animals) and we all can quickly get back to our day's requirements.  Pretty good portions/value too. Five stars, easily.",

Everything has been dynamite! We now get lunch there on average twice a week!! I have at least 4-5 coworkers that now go here too. Falafel where have you been all my life! Theirs is great! You need to give it a try!!",

    "text": "Parsley Modern Mediterranean isn't the most authentic food in town.. but it is quite tasty.   As other reviewers have stated, this ordering set-up here is similar to a place like Chipotle: you pick the style of dish you want (skewers, wraps, bowls and so on) and then select toppings and extras, and then pay. Parsley is clean, casual, and staffed with super friendly employees. Service has always been exceeded my expectations for a laid back spot like this.   I saw my friend Jamie P. had written about the steak bowl in her review so I decided to try it out. It was so good, definitely my favorite item to order. The pita bread here is not my favorite,  and on my last visit the hummus was on the watery side, which is never a good sign.   Aside from the hummus situation, I have had nothing but great experiences at Parsley. Definitely a recommended spot for a quick, Mediterranean-esque meal.  TIP: Groupon has a deal for Parsley currently!",

They weren't rude but they were very pushy. They seemed more annoyed by people's questions on what items and options were. I mean some people have never eaten Mediterranean Food so you would think they would be so inclined as to be more suggestive to customers. I mean basic opportunity to upsell, be informative and helpful. I mean to me Parsley doesn't want to be the next Chipotle. Don't make it an assembly line built an experience. But for some reason everyone (4) in line, who happened to be new first time costumers had to just figure it out. I missed out on quinoa and eggplant! (Both of which I Love) because I simply didn't know! The lady said do you want anything from this section and was rushing us along. Next time I'm better prepared though. All in all the food was so yummy that I'll still eat there but maybe go to a different location. Or I'll get a job there.  But I did check in with Yelp and received my free baklava! It was delicious and perfect!   I ordered: Chicken bowl, I used tzatziki sauce, and the red hot sauce is key def get that if you like it spicy like me! Don't forget your hummus worth the $1 and pita bread.   Lastly big pet peeve!  Packaging it's 2019 let's get some eco-friendly cutlery, cups and packaging. Parsley promotes fresh, no preservatives food..... They should really promote sustainable products as well. Be apart of leading the pack like Starbucks.   Rant done.",

I really felt bad because this place is so good and the last thing you want to hear is that there is not a good working environment. Employees should feel good about where they work and not feel harassed by their peers or supervisors.  A lady came marching from the back with a pack of cigarettes in her hand pointing her finger and yelling aggressively at the employee I was speaking to. This is so awkward. I can't wait to take my order and leave. There proper ways to handle and correct employees and to ensure a great working environment. This store needs better management and training of employees in the front. The food was amazing. Wishing everyone well on this. Hope this helps management.",

She only addressed the customers and said \"Next!\" after finishing up to take their orders. She could have just said someone else will take care of the UberEats order for him.   That just ruined my first and only impression. No matter the circumstances, every time the door to your business opens, it is an opportunity.

I love how can you customize your bowl but be aware that it's extra for certain things to add into your bowl/gyro/salad.   My favorite was their falafel! It was so delicious.

We went for the Steak Bowl and the Chicken Curry for our 1st visit, neither disappointed. The flavors are as rich as you would expect from marinated shwarma, joined by a generous serving of basmati rice and greek salad. Lots of topping options favorites like cucumber yogurt, touboli, and tzatziki.  Combo'd up with the Parsley and Feta fries. Crispy and tasty, the fries were a killer side. Looking forward to sampling the hummus here on my next visit, if it's as good tonight's delicious meal this will be my new go-to for fresh Mediterranean.",

I had rice with it which was good and a side salad . Always get extra hot sauce it is amazing . The tuna salad was also very good and it is made without mayo which was the selling point . Everything here was really tasty . Service was quick .  The addon prices are well posted although we thought it was weird that there's no charge for sauces but more tomatoes were an extra charge . The salad only had a couple diced tomatos on it .   Overall I'm surprised I haven't been here yet but the place is really good and we will back !",

On the first visit, it was one of the least friendly places on our trip to Vegas. But they were redeemed the second time.   Tzatziki, hummus, pita chips, baguettes, falafel, and chicken over rice all tasted good. The beef salad with all the fixing is delicious. Make sure you use a Groupon discount, $18 for 2x$16 coupons. Then it will be worth it. Without the discount, I think it's a bit expensive with all the great food around Vegas at great prices. Let's hope it stays competitive.",

It's limited seating inside, but there's also seats outside as well.   Customer service here is a 5/5. Every person who works here who we encountered had a bright, cheerful, positive vibe. So that's a plus!   For the food I got the Chicken Salad. It was delicious! Upgraded my dish for a side dish and drink. Got the Parsley Fries, which were yum! And after seeing reviews about this cucumber drink, you know I had to try! It was very refreshing. Added some Sprite to it to give it a little fizz though. Lol.  Will most definitely be back to try other items on the menu!",

However, on the day of my son's birthday party, the food was not delivered at the scheduled time even though I called the order in a week in advance.  I scheduled delivery for 2:15 and the party started at 2:30. I even called that morning to confirm the order. I called them at 2:45 and could not get anyone to pick up. I had to call at least seven times before anyone answered. By then, all of the guests had arrived. Thankfully we ordered pizza for the kids. When they finally answered, the girl on the phone said the food was ready to be picked up - not that the delivery was on the way. She later called back and said no one informed them that it was supposed to be delivered. The food arrived an hour and a half after the scheduled time. It was cold and everyone had filled up on pizza. They threw in a big bag of STALE baklava to \"make up\" for their mistake.  I was hoping for a call from the owner, but never got one. I tried to reach out to her the following Monday with no luck.   We were left with a ton of leftovers that we couldn't finish. It was $175.00 down the drain. It was such a disappointing experience.",

    "text": "After waking up late on a crisp winter Saturday I felt no desire to cook let alone make a single cup of coffee. Instead I headed to Starbucks which took longer to get to than making a cup of coffee. However, you rarely consider those details when crafting a laziness inspired plan.   I arrived at the good ole, overpriced, over roasted, push button coffee preparation establishment aka Starbucks and picked up my drinks. Luckily these were compliments of Visa and didn't come out of my pocket. Thank you Visa.   After taking a a few sips of the very strong cold brew my stomach quickly protested by aching. It was hungry and seeing that I hadn't fed it in 18 hours the coffee was making sure I didn't forget about its current state of emptiness. Enter Parsley the modern Mediterranean restaurant conveniently next door. I quickly read a few reviews and decided that 4.5 stars for a suburban eatery is typically worth checking out.   Once inside I approached the counter and bluntly asked the smiling woman to \"school me\" as I'd never been there and really just wanted a gyro. A sandwich made with lamb or steak, lettuce, tomato, feta cheese and cucumber yogurt dressing all contained within a warm and delicious pita bread. However, this gem of a meal wasn't on the menu. I don't really understand why as a well prepared Gyro can bring a tear to my eye. I wonder if a Gyro is really a low brow type of sandwich that higher end places avoid. I don't know.   After getting a sample of their steak and chicken I promptly chose the steak.    The steak bowl which came with a generous bed of lettuce, a healthy serving of yellow #5 rice (I'm sure it was natural, albeit blinding yellow). Atop the rice was what looked to be 4-5 ounces of delicious steak followed by dressing of your choice. My choice was cucumber yogurt which again was very good. For an additional dollar which is my only complaint, you could get feta cheese, extra dressing, olives and a few other items. They are so generous with the portions you'd think they continue that over to the items you pay extra for. Nope!! I got approx, 12 cents worth of feta and I'm not talking about retail pricing. It's almost as bad as Subway charging so much extra for a quarter of an avocado. (It's an avocado, not rare caviar!)  Well, despite the peasant serving of feta I sat down and thoroughly enjoyed my whole meal. I chose 5 stars because the food is really well prepared, the staff is friendly, the restaurant was super clean and well decorated. The cheese did impact my opinion but I can't let it take a star away and potentially steer some 5 star snob away from this place.  I will be back but I may have to bring my own feta! Is that weird?",

On my last two visits, I got some major shade/attitude from the lady making the orders.  One example:  I ask for some chopped cucumbers and tomatoes in my Chicken Plate.  She replies \"that'll be an extra charge because the salad mix already has cucumbers and tomatoes.\"  In the past, I've never been given this answer.  Plus, there were like 2 tiny cubes of cucumber and 1 itty bitty piece of tomato in the salad portion.  My entire chicken plate experience was like this.   Note to management:  teach your employees to be kinder...a happy customer is worth 10000x more than an ounce of veg.  The food is good, but at times I feel they're trying to nickel and dime you on every topping.  Additional advice to management:  Arrange the damn ingredients in a way to CLEARLY show which cost extra....OR just don't charge extra for these things.  Your customers will be grateful for that and make return visits.  It costs you so little for these ingredients. #bereal",

We walked in during dinner time, and the first thing I sensed was the low energy lingering in the place. The meat grills were turned off and everyone was off doing their thing.   When they finally acknowledged us, they informed us they were out of chicken for one of their featured items. Really?!?  I ordered curry beef with rice snd, although the portions were huge, the food was hopelessly bland and unremarkable.  My girlfriend's lentil soup was no different-- it was a cup of mushy lentils with zero flavor.   I had really high hopes for this place, but I do not think I will be trying it again anytime soon.",

Best deal - share a large sandwich or get a regular plus order a combo. They gave us a 1/2 pint of bana ganoush.  It was Excellent with perfect subtle traditional smoky flavor.  Take your time ordering if you haven't been there.  They expect you know what you want if they are busy.  PS they gave us a free baklava for checking in... it was VERY good.

They offer steak and chicken shawarma, both were delicious but I think the chicken was a bit more flavorful. There are various salad mix-ins available like tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, chickpeas... I had my salad with tsaziki sauce as dressing, and warm pita bread. I also tried a bit of cabbage salad and eggplant salad. Neither disappointed. The cucumber cooler was pretty good as well. Not too sweet and refreshing. A Yelp check in gets you a free dessert and even when trying to be skinny, I can never say no to dessert... I opted for a chocolate drizzled baklava that was fresh and tasty.  Well rounded, almost guilt free meal. I will be back!",

But keep in mind they do add charges to some ingredients they have which is not bad at all, I also recommend getting their parsely fries as a side and dont forget their refreshing cucumber drink!

They have the meat up on rotisserie spinners and they carve it off fresh to order. You basically pick from a bowl or wrap. I picked the bowl with both steak and chicken. Large portion with lettuce, garbanzo beans, cabbage and rice. The meat has great flavor and moist all the way through. You can also add a variety of dressings, spiced compotes, cheese, and veggies. I had the green and red compotes and both were pretty spicy but really good. The tzatki cream cucumber dressing was a great compliment to the bowl. I also had pita and hummus and it was great! Pita was fresh, hot, and soft. The cucumber beverage was a nice refreshing drink not too sweet.  I will definitely be back to try other items!",

Food has become sub par at best, portions are large but if you ask for any other vegetables you get a spoonful so small you won't even notice it there. Also it has to be placed on the outside of the plate not in n the center where it makes sense and if you ask for anything other than what they're instructed to do the staff will argue with you. You can forget the customer always being right here. Ps chicken was cold",

Fernando comped some of our food, but most importantly he seemed sincere in his apology, and seemed to understand our inconvenience rather than treating our complaint as a nuisance. The beef kabob was good (aside from being overdone in my case) and the accompanying jasmine rice flavorsome, the falafel was alright (a little too spicy), and the Hummus dip topped with Kalamata olives was pretty good. Their house made Cucumber chiller drink, probably made with melons and cucumber is very refreshing and a great alternative to sodas. The only dessert on the menu, Baklava, was however average.",

First impression- Inside of the restaurant was done greatly. The setup is familiar to something you would see at chipotle,the lines were clean and it was open & modern. Chipotle style menu, but Mediterranean and better .There's also additional seating outside, but that's if you can find a table, if it's not occupied by the overflow loiterers from Starbucks next door.   The taste - I ordered the Red Quinoa Salad with shawarma chicken, that also came with pita bread . Since this was my first visit, the lady behind the counter explained everything in full detail and recommended the salad that I chose... She said it was perfect for post gym training .   I also ordered the cucumber chiller, it reminded me of an aguas fresca. It was very tasty. The salad was plentiful it included the following: salad, chickpeas, quinoa, chicken, feta,  tzatziki and I added carrots.  The flavor profile was very good . Everything was fresh and filling . I had leftovers .   Overall - Service was friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and filling and not overly heavy. Establishment was clean inside and outside . I give it 5/5   I shall return :)",

Fernando recommended the falafel and the vegetarian sampler. I ended up ordering the vegetarian sampler platter with a side of chicken. Everything tasted delicious and fresh. The portions were also very generous. The big standouts to me were the hummus, the baba ganoosh, and the eggplant salad. I'll definitely be back for both the food and the customer service!",

Bleh - I guess that's better than having chicken just out under a heat lamp or something, and 2)  Just one skewer is a plate?  What a ripoff!  But when I got my food, I realized that I was way off on 2).  The skewer was much bigger than I thought it was, and there were like, 5 or 6 golf ball sized chicken pieces on there.  That, plus the rice and the salad was more than enough for me, and I usually eat a lot for lunch.  The gf ordered the falafel bowl, since she didn't think she was hungry enough for a plate.  Well I dunno if the bowl is supposed to be smaller than the plate, but man, that was a ton of food too.  I think they gave her like 5 or 6 falafels along with salad and I think rice was in there too.  Definitely a lot of food, but it tasted great.  Not the best ever, but definitely above average.  It's right down the street from The Orleans casino, and since we stay there on occasion, we'll definitely come back next time!",

I ordered take out for lunch, for the first time, yesterday through the yelp app.  When I arrived at the restaurant, they had not received my order for some reason.  They stated it was the second order that had not gone through for the day and apologized.  I told them I was on my lunch break and would not have time to wait for my order to be prepared, so they offered to make it and deliver it to me!  Less than an hour later, my food arrived at work with an added bonus (dessert) for the trouble.  The guy even apologized again.  That is excellent customer service!  Something went wrong and they went above and beyond to make it right. I ordered the Chicken Shishkabob Plate, which came with their yellow rice and a pretty large side of salad.  The chicken was moist and had excellent flavor.  The rice was also very good.  The tzatziki dressing for my salad was great too.  I also got a side of hummus for $3.99 and some grape leaves for an added $1.00 The hummus was delicious and the grape leaves were awesome!  I only wish I would've gotten more than 2 pieces of pita bread, so I could've eaten all of my hummus. The bonus desserts were a small triangle of baklava that was sweet w/ the perfect amount of syrup and crunch from the filo, and what I believe is a kourabiedes w/ some sort of chewy/nutty center (I had never seen this before, I even had to google it) which was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely have both of those the next time I come! My only issue was that I ordered a Diet Coke and the guy brought me a regular Coke.",

They made the chicken as we ordered. I do wish there were pictures or descriptions of what each option came with. I ordered the humus shawarma with chicken and it came with Humus and chicken and you got to choose the veggies and sauce. My friend ordered the chicken bowl and his came with rice and salad  he got to choose  veggies and a sauce too. I would definitely go again. They have a patio and inside seating.",

The good is great and I especially like the lentil soup.   Super disappointed! I am a regular here because the food is good. Today was the WORST experience I've ever had here and has made me look for a new place to grab a quick lunch.  The new employee made my side salad in the full sized container- no big deal, right? WRONG! The lady (I'm assuming manager on duty) didn't 3 minutes telling me I ordered a Greek salad because of the yogurt. Firstly, there was no yogurt, I had a small soup; secondly, I know what I ordered.  Rather than simply apologize for the employee error and send me on my way, she literally remade the whole salad in the smaller container wasting my previous lunch time, her staff's time, and a perfectly fine side salad.  If the manager I'm familiar with isn't there when I go back (I believe in second chances, then I won't be going back.",

I come here every week for the steak or beef kabob plate and I can't get enough of It! They offer the main meals in either a bowl, which will have the salad under the rice and your choice of meat; a plate, which will have all three side by side, or a wrap, which will have everything inside on a delicious wrap. They have all the items that are common in Mediterranean restaurants for you to add, some at no cost and some costing you an extra dollar.  You will have different options to make a combo and make the most out of your experience.  They love regulars and have a rewards program, you will get a code to text to a number or enter on the app they use called Perka, and each code count as one point. After 10 points you will get a meal for free!  Trust me, it's easy to get those 10 points as they are great with costumer service and their food rocks!!",

The chix and steak on the rotating vertical spit were flavorful without overdoing it on the spices/garlic. Their salad  is a mixture of fresh cut lettuce, cabbages, beans, cucumbers and tomatoes. The steak meat on my salad plate were crispy smaller pieces of about 1 cup of meat. I expected the shaved gyro style of 1/2 inch meat strips, but their layered steak style spit mound made for smaller but crispier tidbit pieces. Good.  The hummus was outstanding. I would've been happy just eating the hummus and pita if I had to.  I diluted their green cucumber lemonade drink with water and ice. Refreshing. Too sweet for this sour-puss.  Want to try their curries next.  Price point is very reasonable. I like that you can pick and choose your veggie toppings and  sauces. Great concept.",

Taco Bell?), Wingstop (too heavy), Qdoba (aka the Fredo of fast food Tex-Mex) and Denny's (no, not drunk yet), Parsley is nothing short of a freakin goldmine.  I'm not sure people even do lunch at the Starbucks next door, but I kinda feel bad if they do.  The shawarma (chicken or beef) here is pretty good.  Shaved right off the vertical spit as I hungrily watch...on pita, in a salad, on vanilla ice cream, or simply just placed hot on my bare hand,  I'll take it any which way they'll give it to me.  I only wished they offered lamb, but can't imagine that would be a very popular order on West Tropicana and Decatur.    I do takeout every time, since lunch is usually a mob scene, and rely on Yelp's Eat24 app to place the order.  My food is ready about 70% of the time I walk through the door and if it isn't, the super friendly staff get to it as soon as possible.  There have been a couple of times where they don't receive a notification at all, but I'll notch that up to the Eat24 employees being on their rice break.      A few other things:  - I really like their spicy, pickled carrots, which can be added at no charge.  The chicken shawarma salad, tzatziki sauce and carrots all in one bite kind of tastes like an exotic buffalo wing.  No, I am currently not on drugs.   - They claim to have the best falafel in Las Vegas; I'd say it's a solid top 3 with Cleo still being my favorite.   - I've had fantasies of ripping the top off the fountain drink machine of their homemade cucumber chiller, picking it up, and drinking straight from it.  It's a very tasty and refreshing beverage.  Consistently solid!",

    "text": "We tried this place on Saturday night based on the good reviews and the photos of the food.  Two plates of food and no drinks cost $24. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. The two stars are for the \"ambiance.\" I realize this is not a fancy restaurant, but the staff allowed the roughest looking homeless person I've ever seen to come in, dump her dirty belongings on a table, help herself to the fountain drinks, and occupy one of the few open tables for the duration of our meal. We watched as she scratched at her head for 30 minutes, leaving God knows what behind on the table and chairs. We thought we'd eat outside instead, but a guy that looked like he got out of prison earlier that day was pacing angrily on the patio next to a group of cabbies smoking next to the no smoking signs. I expected one of the four employees to have handed the homeless woman a cup of water and asked her to leave so the paying customers would be able to eat in comfort, but she was invisible to them. I realize I sound like a jerk now, and maybe this review makes you want to frequent this business based on their compassion toward the destitute, but I will not be returning.",

Their chicken which is cooked off a rotisserie was the highlight because I value chicken being freshly cooked that way especially when it's fresh & hot. After being served on bowl with delicious salad & rice I specifically added extra tahini sauce (for extra charge) & it made the chicken come more alive with savory flavors. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already.",

We ended up getting a chicken shawarma bowl and a ground beef kabob. It is a pretty large amount of food for the money you pay so I would say it is worth it :) ! and if you check in you can egt a baklava so it doesn't get any better than that.",

They seem to have multiple locations so might be a franchise of sort but seems unlike normal franchises where people don't care about the customers or their food.  We also got a free Baklava for checking-in on Yelp which was a surprisingly nice treat.    The food was delicious and the flavors were very good.  We will definitely plan a meal everything we are in Vegas from now on.  Enjoy!",

My friends tuna salad thing was ok but other than that the pita bread wasn't very good and overall not a good experience. The people working here didn't seem to know what was going on. The restaurant has a-lot of background noise making it hard to hear or order your food.  In the end the money you pay isn't worth it for the kind of food you get.  Have a great day!",

I had the absolute worst service of my life here tonight. From start to finish, the two hour (yes two hours!) experience of trying to get my food was a complete disaster every step of the way. I was lied to, disrespected, and ultimately given a wrong and incomplete order. Throughout the whole ordeal, the manager thought that it was acceptable to call me \"honey\" and repeatedly interrupt me with \"Well actually...(insert random lies and excuses here)\". I don't expect five star service from this kind of place but this went beyond apathy.    This was a circus of rude incompetence. Oh, and if you do decide to ignore my experience and place an order with this flaming dumpster fire of a business, whatever you do, do not use their app, which is available for download in the app store, because according to the employees here, it doesn't even exist.",

You pick your protein, and then you pick how you want it. You can get it as a bowl, salad, wrap, or plate. Then you pick toppings and sauces. It kind of remind me of chipotle in the style that you pick what you want. I got the chicken schwarma bowl with a drink and vegan baklava. I only wanted the vegan one cause it had pistachios on it. My meal was $15, which isn't bad considering all of the food they give you. I got the cucumber lemon drink which was amazing! I loved it, and they have it on tap, so it's a regular drink, not extra. The food was really good, and the baklava was good too. The place was nice and clean. They even have a bar too, which I thought was nice too. I will definitely be back to come try more of their food and try out the bar too. Definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "Love at first bite?... As places for a quick falafel wrap go, Parsley has to be my favorite in town. The falafel is made to order...so it does take a few minutes, but it is worth the wait. I am a fan of a little heat and Parsley Modern Mediterranean has a great spicy sauce. They actually have two of them, a green mild sauce and red hot sauce...and it's this red one that I'm talking about here. It is quite spicy, and works so perfectly to bring up the heat on a falafel wrap.  I was talking to my love about a post from lasvegasfill, yes THE lasvegasfill, about Parsley, and then a day or two later she picked up some for us to try for the first time. I can still feel the lovely tingling sensation of heat with that first bite...the red hot sauce!..mixed in with hummus and tzatziki, combine as the perfect accompaniment to fresh falafel. The falafel themselves are on point as well. Parsley is no sit-down restaurant, but their falafel is moist, flavorful, and cooked well, easily making it better than most sit-down restaurants in town. They have a couple of vertical spits for their shawarma and gyro meat, a flame grill for cooking all their and kebabs, and a dedicated falafel station--making it readily apparent they are aren't trying to cut corners in their food preparations. They also have all their cold salad/bowl/wrap options on display for you to select as they complete your order, think the Chipotle of Mediterranean food...only slower. I haven't ventured on to other items on the menu, but as for their falafel, I'm a big fan, and have been in a couple times since my first introduction to enjoy it again.",

She repeated herself twice with an attitude, \"chicken or steak\". She definitely set the tone because not only was she not being courteous, she was rushing us to ring us up. We weren't even done ordering! Just added an eggplant salad & left, even though we had intentions of ordering another bowl. She was rude & just made us uncomfortable!

Today it was just a waste of money - an appetizer was missing, the chicken kabob was bland, the cabbage salad was basically just cut up cabbage with no dressing (I swear), the chicken schnitzel was burnt, my salad was missing the dressing on the side so basically it was LETTUCE... I called to inquire about the appetizer missing and they were like \"we don't know how to issue refunds if not for the whole order...\" - well, learn how not to mess up... I guess? They wanted to give me a credit for a future order to redeem in store. I was like... can't you just  refund my $4 now...? Wth... the manager was apologetic and said she would call grubhub to give me a refund (we shall see if that happens) and that she hoped that we would order again.   but anyways after I hanged up I realized my cabbage salad didn't have any dressing and all the other issues. But you know what? I had just gotten home from a 24 hr flight and I didn't have it in me to call and bitch about my order AGAIN. The whole point of ordering was that I didn't have to stress about making food. Smh.   I regret spending $40 on this food but I guess that's okay because I bought my right to know I won't be ordering from this place ever again.",

There's a lot of the same to choose from but made well makes a big difference. Also made fresh   This will probably be my new spot because you can switch up your vegetables and meat dishes how you like.  Customer service is awesome. I haven't tried any desserts but maybe I'll check in later.   Busy but not bad it's good food so it should be busy.  Totally Recommend. Have something other than a burger for once.",

My favorite is definitely the falafel wrap. But the eggplant salad, the vine leaves, the hummus... are also stunning. Plus they now have a stamp card (and the electronic version of it on Perka), which gives you a free wrap after you buy 10. Fresh ingredients, vegan options, gyros with chicken or beef, smiles... what would you expect more? Less than $10 for a very decent lunch (even their small size is already enough)! I already converted some of my colleagues and we're now a couple to go there at least on a weekly basis.",

For example, here's how one part of the menu reads: Chicken Bowl Chicken Plate Chicken Salad Chicken Kabob Bowl Chicken Kabob Plate Chicken Kabob Salad  No explanations below any of those. They only seem to have a grill. So what's the difference between \"Chicken\" and \"chicken kabobs?\" You'll have to ask. And they didn't seem to have much of an answer other than when i asked it to say, \"oh, ok. chicken kabob.\" and put it on the grill. So I still have no idea how the \"chicken\" is different. I asked about the bowl or plate. Or on a napkin? I ordered the chicken salad. My friend ordered the bowl. The only difference was the addition of rice to the exact same dish. Assembled exactly the same way. When I'm tired and hungry, I don't have a lot of excess patience to try to figure out what you are trying to sell me. As for the chicken itself, they put it on the grill for a LONG time. I expected it to be way overcooked and dry. But it wasn't. It was perfectly cooked. The beef didn't come out as well. Overall, the food wasn't bad. They just need a better explanation of what they are selling and how to order  your food.",

And I loved the cucumber chiller, but it's True, you need to love the taste of cucumber to enjoy.  I'd say the parsley fries were not my favorite and while the employees were extremely nice, they seemed a little ill prepared for large groups.  There was a person in front of my group ordering six items to go and it really backed things up. I'll definitely be back though - the food was yummy!",

The chicken and beef Shwarma plates included salad (your choice on veggies for the salad and VERY dry rice that seemed as if it sat out all day. You could get hummus, which is extra and olives (extra). The meats were appearing to look as if they were either leftover pieces sitting on the bottom of where they cut and slice the meats. Both, the beef and the chicken were ULTRA dry, piled in a cluster. The chicken had a weird smell to it and the pieces (literally small crumb-like pieces) were just not appetizing at all. Even with drowning it in sauces or dips, it had a weird flavor to it. Both, were utterly disappointing as I was excited to try this \"modern\" twist. I can't understand what made it so modern? Perhaps the fact that they don't do any kind of \"Gyros\" and serve choices on Baguette's instead? I ended up picking at the salad. The olives were extremely salty. The rice was too dry and the Baklava couldn't even save this meal. Total disappointment.",

First time I ordered a beef kabob bowl and a chicken kabob bowl it was okay, the beef kabob was ground beef balls, did not really like the taste, the chicken was better. This time I had ordered a beef shawarma and a chicken shawarma bowl to go. I had asked for the sauce to be on the side (since the first time I came here it was spicy) and instead they poured it right on top. Instead of asking for a new one decided to just settle for this, which I shouldn't have since the sauce they have is quite spicy, my girlfriend had to take most of what was covered in sauce off because of this, which was most of the meat. Probably better off going somewhere else that's similar in aspect like halal guys now that there's one in town.",

No problem except, I ended up behind a customer who was relaying orders from her friends over the phone to the two remaining assembly line employees and apparently they had no clue what they actually wanted so I just had to stand there and wait while my lonely kabob sat on the warmer begging for me to eat it. The food itself was reasonably priced, the flavor was good and the amount of food you get was good too.",

We ended up getting: 1) Falafel side order- Falafel was great, kinda crunchy, only good when hot- not good at home after being heated up (4 come with the side order) 2) Mixture/Sample plate- Got pita, salad- which I asked to substitute for rice but then was told that i had to pay another 1.50 for this substitution, feta, hummus, olives, babaganoosh  -hummus was super garlicy- just the way i like it- very cream and quite a large serving - feta was very salty -olives were in olive oil and very tasty- about 6-7 served - Babaganoosh was excellent- wish i got more 3)Hummus Shawarma Bowl- chicken grilled with salad, hummus and pita (whole wheat) 4) Cucumber house drink- was highly recommended but i couldnt stand the taste wouldnt recommended unless you love the taste of cucumber The food was ok all together but the reason why i give them 5 stars is because the service was supurb. And if you buy the cucumber drink (and love it like my husband did)- you get unlimited refills George knew I was upset about the 1.50$ upcharge on the rice for salad so he brought me out some rice after my hubby and I sat down. Couldnt have been happier!!",

From the moment we walked in, to the second we walked out, there was no customer service whatsoever. Ya know how a lot of places ask you if you'd been there before, and if not, they'll explain it to you. Not at Parsley. They won't even say hi to you and ask what you want, just kinda blankly stare at you until you figure it out on your own.  I went with the steak bowl, and moving down the line felt like I should've thrown my wallet over the counter and walked away. You want extra meat? $3-$4. Extra sauce? That'll cost the you a buck. A little cheese? $1. Olives sound good? Another $1. Everyone likes a dollop of hummus on their bowl, right? You guessed it, fork over another Washington. The bowl already cost $9 and let me tell you, they aren't heavy handed with really anything in there, especially the meats. If you're feeling hungry, I feel bad for ya son...because it won't be a cheap lunch.  Was the bowl good? Eh, it was alright. The flavors were decent, and everything tasted fairly fresh. But all it really is, is a salad with a few toppings on it. Certainly not worth nearly $10. Add on crappy service with rude employees, I'll pass on Parsley.",

I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with extra tzatziki and added babaganoush. My bf ordered a steak shawarma bowl. The first thing I noticed is that they didn't put any tzatziki sauce in the bag. This upsets me so much. That's like ordering chicken nuggets and then forgetting to give you the sauce. Tzatziki makes everything better, I'm so sad they forgotten about it, especially because I paid extra another serving! Anyways, the salad and rice were really good! The chicken was really dry but had a good flavor. The steak was also really tasty and cooked well. Overall, food was a 3 service a 1. Meraki is a way better choice but so much further from me.   I will probably try it again since it's really close to my house. Hopefully they don't forget the tzatziki sauce and babaganoush next time.",

First of all, the service provided by your staff; EXCEPTIONAL!!! Rosemary & Keenyun; you would have thought it was there restaurant. Perfect recommendations. Perfect service. Perfect smiles! You are lucky to have such wonderful team members working for you.   Both beef & chicken Schwarma and some baklava at the end did the trick it was exactly what we wanted and had wanted for quite some time.   Thanks for everything. See you soon!!!",

Their quinoa recipe is to die for! I really wish they got a bigger spot so I don't feel so bad standing in line (I really don't feel that bad. I mean I will wait as long as it take for this food!). When you're in line, you almost knock into the tables next to you. But that's literally my only complaint! The food is OUTSTANDING! Go here! Go here now!!",

I ordered the falafel bowl which came with rice and salad and falafel and you can add three things like hummus and tZatziki sauce and everything. Watch out the hot sauce is HOt. A little bit is good but If you get overboard it is very over powering. They have a combo deal with the parsley fries which come with parsley and feta cheese. All in all this place is good and the prices are good as well. The portions here are huge so keep that in mind and don't over order like we did.",

We ordered two falafel plates which were quite filling and tasty. The falafel plates came with rice, salad, toppings and pita bread. Our total order was around $22-not bad for Vegas!  Our servers were professional and answered our questions politely.  The set up is buffet style behind glass (imagine Chipotle), and they offer both indoor and outdoor seating.  It's not fancy, but is nowhere close to being a dump. The grounds were clean, and I didn't spot any signs of cross-contamination.   I can say with certaintly, I'll be back!",

I ordered a Steak Schwarma Salad and a Chicken Schwarma Wrap as I wanted to try both.  Order process was not too smooth and the employees seemed overworked, nervous and not very happy.  It was disappointing they didn't have any fresh brewed iced tea to drink.  I spent over $20 on lunch and they gave me a water glass that looked like the tiny cups the dentist gives you to spit in between drilling.  I ended up going back and forth to fill it up at the soda machine and it kept putting a little red punch drink in my water which didn't enhance the lunch experience.  My food looked great and I was happy the worker measured the meat out in a cup so they are consistent on what they give you.  Upon trying the Schwarma both were without any flavor.  I was super disappointed because the reason I love Mediterranean food so much is the bold flavors.  The lettuce was extremely disappointing as it also had no flavor.  They need to add some Vinegar, Garlic, Lemon, something to give it a dressing that takes your breath away but it was just sprayed with oil.  I had them add their spicy sauce when going through the line and I enjoyed it but without that both meats were flavorless.  The Hummus was surprisingly excellent.  The Tzatziki sauce and the Tahini sauce were also dead upon arrival.  I would give this place a 2 on food and 1 on service and friendliness so I am giving it a 2 rating.",

The staff has been friendly and while the appetizers have been good, both times I have been extremely disappointed with the steak schwarma.  It is cooked on an gyro machine and the way the sheer it off, much of the meat is either overcooked or contains a great deal of fat and grissle.  The dressing used on the salad is good but as it is prepared and tossed in advance, it breaks down quickly with the lettuce losing its texture and both wilting and browning. Quality could easily improve by preparing fresh during slower periods as opposed to using what was left over from the dinner rush.  At 16 bucks for the combo with appetizer and drink, it felt quite expensive for the lack of quality and there are many alternatives. With better food preparation and attention to what is served, Parsley could certainly excel. Three stars for friendly service and good appetizers. Ok with a Groupon but at full price I will continue to explore other venues.",

Everything is made fresh daily and you can taste it. I ordered a falafel bowl and was pretty pumped when I saw the staff prep and fry them fresh in front of me. It was also a great size for the price. I ended up taking half to go. I recommend the spicy little carrots to nibble with your meal. The line flow was nice and easy.

    "text": "After eating there every second day for almost a year (part of my salad diet) I have had it. When asking for an extra scoop of chopped tomatoes on an 10$ salad I was told that \"we had to charge you more\" - the hell you haven't. To start with 11$ is expensive for a salad and you are gonna be cheap with raw veggies like chopped tomatoes and chopped cucumbers. I spend in the region of 45$ at your establishment a week. But NO MORE and you can thank your employee Ken for that. I am sure I can find other places that will serve me a salad and not be cheap with something as pedestrian as lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers   Follow up:  after their Facebook Messenger person assured me that they would be in touch not a damn thing has happened for over a month now. Apparently they REALLY DO NOT care for their customers. Now I'm definitely NEVER going back",

I have to say that the rice really helped complement the steak and lettuce. They're extremely generous with their servings of hummus and chickpeas. The workers are super friendly and helpful.

The chicken or steak shawarma Pita nachos with spicy hummus, tsaziki (sp?), feta, veggies, etc just topped all Asada nachos, period. My eyes rolled back. LoL If you like falafel, they have the best in town in my opinion! Tasty and not mushy like others I've tried.  #postworkout #treatmeal   I thought of giving 4 stars but it's actually a good thing they don't serve a lot of my fave Greek desserts here or I'll double my weight in no time!

We like veggies, even when we are on vacay and this is a great spot to get food that won't leave you constipated the next day. (I'm a nurse, so I realize that these sort of conversations are hard for people, but they also reflect reality :-)  We like to feel good, even on vacation and Parsely's gives you lots options to feel good. This place is teaming with healthy, fit people (and the cute chubbies as well) because the veg is fresh and aplenty and the price is so good. We totally pigged out for $40 including tax and baklava but usually your price per person is abou $10. Our reco's: Falafel salad with their spicy red sauce. It needs the heat because it healthily does not have a lot of salt. Add some babaganoush, taziki, and hummus (usually you pay $1 extra per side unless it is automatically included) and you've got yourself quite the  Mediterranean spread. The Hummus plate is great as wel. Just the Hummus with pita chips is worth getting. Their fresh pita chips are soo good.   Don't forget the Cucumber Chiller for $1.99. The yellow curry is fabulous as well, rice is seasoned so well you could eat it by itself. Next time I'm going to get the Nachos. Yum.",

    "text": "For the best fast casual Mediterranean restaurant in town, Parsley has to be the winner. They have three locations now in town. (Green Valley, Decatur/Trop, W. Flamingo/215) I have been to all three and they are all equally wonderful.   The falafel is my favorite, has such good flavor, and is crispy on the outside & soft on the inside. I like to have it with their salad which is very good, spicy carrots (yum!), and their hot sauce. They have a red and green hot sauce and both are very good.   My husband usually goes for beef or chicken shawarma or kabob. The kabob takes a while as they make it fresh, so if we are on a hurry, he will just get the shawarma which is still very tasty.   The only downside is the pita bread isn't homemade, but I suppose it usually wouldn't be at a fast casual restaurant.   If Parsley would open up a new location on the southwest side by Mountain's Edge, I would turn in a falafel ball because I would be eating there all the time!",

In my opinion, even though it may be more costly, Id say get rid of the steak and bring in the lamb(or just add it in there just for me).  Sitting at the table with my spicy green habanero hot sauce and that light cucumber sauce drizzled on the top of the rice and romaine lettuce I dreamt of some juicy lamb filling the spaces where my chicken went.  I gotta say yall, the thought made me wanna bring in my own lamb to add to everyones plate.  All the staff are friendly/helpful and the place is clean.  The only thing that bothered me about this location is the fact that Im 6'2\" and can not see the menu on there board unless I bend over.  To all the travelers and regulars, this place is worth a little back trouble.",

    "text": "First to note is that it's a build-your-own style, much like Pizza Rev or Chipotle, and not a sit-down restaurant.  Although I was a little disappointed, that is not the reason for my rating. Today I give a 2/5 stars because the place was packed and even though we patiently waited, the employee who handled our food had poor customer service. He would not listen to our requests, could not answer our questions, and got offended when my friend asked the kind veteran employee, Kammie, an important dietary question he wouldn't answer. Admittedly, he was new and that's fine but he should have admitted that instead of giving us bs answers that could have resulted in one of us having an allergic reaction.  After the restaurant cleared a bit and we were still eating, the first employee went to clear the patio furniture. Great, do your job. But then, HE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS. This was obvious because he walked past us, through the door, and was immediately in the kitchen. With his dirty hands he proceeded to put away containers and utensils. Next he walks away and returns with a rag and begins to wipe down the counters and containers near the food. While wiping one container he finds a piece of food on the side, picks it off, then throws it back into the food.  The food WAS tasty, besides the dry chicken, and I would like to try some other items but I cannot accept that employee's health violations this trip.  Edit: we visited on Tuesday, April 16th around 9PM.",

The food is flavorful, fresh and very nice portions for the amount of money you are paying. I had the opportunity to visit being on that side of town. I was amazed at all the fresh options set before me. All multitudes of people there and everyone in the restaurant was happy eating what they ordered. I cannot wait to go on that side of town to go back. I tried the steak bowl, as well as the chicken kabob. The rice perfectly moist not hard or chewy, yes it was fresh! Staff very friendly and informative. I sampled the chicken curry and it was soooo good. I believe I will get that next time. I tried the cucumber cooler and it was really refreshing and immediately refreshed my pallet. I thank this mediterranean restaurant for its fresh food and well seasoned out of the box   Yassss!! I went back!!! I always go on a Saturday as mentioned before. There she was!!! It was Nancy!!! She saw me, she recognized me!!! I was amazed, and it made me feel welcome. She was smiling and saying yeah your back, I knew you would!! Lol yasss! She was right. Everything was like before, so fresh and healthy that really tastes good. Nancy really has great customer service.  I tried the lentil soup this time as well as the steak plate and beef on a stick plate. (Hubby ate some of mine last time) so everyone got something. And of course they were so good especially with the red chili hot sauce... this place is worth the trip!!!",

    "text": "This place is great!  Only thing I could complain about is lack of seating.  There's several chairs and tables outside but inside, seating is very limited.  I had the falafel bowl. It came with rice, which was delightfully airy and good flavor, various salad greens, I got the green chili sauce, chickpeas, tomatoes, cucumbers and a tahini sauce and of course parsley. The falafels were very good!  Crispy, not too dry not too wet, just right. The greens were crunchy, fresh and not one wilted piece.  The portion was too much to eat in one sitting but I took it home.  The food was really good, like a Mediterranean version of a chipotle.  The staff was friendly and informative.  I had some questions.  My friend questioned how the curry chicken would taste and the worker whipped out a sample cup and gave her an ample try, she got that.  I questioned the cucumber chiller drink. Never drank a cucumber drink before, and she a different worker, whipped out a small cup and said try it. It wasn't for me, but the fact that they were free to offer some samples was awesome.  So many places are proud of their offerings and they put a price tag on them to prove it but rare are they so proud that they let you sample.  Terrific Parsley!  Speaking of price it wasn't outrageous, for two it was equal to my last trip to Carl's Jr. except this food is lightyears better.  I watched the workers treat everyone who walked in the door the same, not with a superficial, forced \"hey how ya doin\" but rather with genuine pride that they were serving up the best they had to offer, no matter what was ordered.  I appreciate that and if all their locations operate this way, it really is a breath of fresh air in an industry which has turned eating out into an assembly line factory of over bloated prices and insincere employees.  Good job Parsley, don't ever change.",

My usual order is: hummus with the green spicy sauce, chicken shawarma, tatziki sauce, spicy carrots, their salad blend, and diced red cabbage. Sometimes make it a combo with grape leaves and their bomb cucumber drink.   Also see on here it says they're open until 9pm, but they're actually open until 10pm!!",

I always get a shcwarma baguette with either chicken or steak. Personally, I like the steak better. Anyways...the baguette is awesome with house made salad, hummus, salsa, and tziki sauce. They have a lot of different options here for side too. Ive had the hummus and pita chips, the egg plant salad, and tziki...but my favorite thing is their Parsley fries. Also, their cucumber cooler drink that they make here is AWESOME very very very refreshing. The only thing I dont like is the check out process...wish it was more streamlined.

They let us taste samples of a couple of items so we could make the best choices and were patient as we made up out minds.   Only two things I'd like to point out as constructive criticisms...the music was too loud- we had to talk to the folks on the other side of the counter to navigate our way through our first time and between the music and kitchen equipment I felt like I was shouting. The other thing was the side of chips I ordered. I chose not to get the combo which could have included chips, because I didn't know what quite what to expect with the Hummus Shwarma Bowl I ordered but after I started eating realized I should have gotten the combo...I needed those chips :) I went to the counter and ordered them. There was some discussion behind the counter about how to ring them up and the verdict for a small side of chips was $3. No big deal but seemed a little steep to add a small portion that would have been less if I got the combo. I know they are still figuring out their groove- just something to note. Congratulations on your second location- keep it coming!",

Chicken schwarma wrap was very delicious and the hot sauce they serve on it reminds me of the sauce I used to get from the Israeli places in NY.  The steak nachos were nice, except the meat was dried out to literally to a crisp.  As I did not yet taste the meat, my husband was the one who commented on it to me.  I then took my bowl up to the girl and she added less dried out steak, because what I first got was the outer layer and then the less dried out meat was then put in the bowl.  That I found to be very accommodating.  Like another reviewer stated, later in the day the meats on the spits tend to get dried out.  Overall, the food was very good and I will definitely return.",

    "text": "$8 steak and hummus bowl and a whole wheat bread, $10 w/ two add ons. I don't think the price is quite worth it after all of it. Only because the flavor is not too great. It's all around very salty. I was able to try the meat, hummus, and Babaganoosh separately, but when put together it's just all very salty and doesn't really come together. I will come back to try something else with my coupon. Just be aware. Groupon leads you to the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate. So you pay $4 for a $10 certificate, then need to purchase a minimum of $20. So in the end you still play $10 after your visit. It's probably best to just purchase the groupon deal to avoid spending extra in store. I told the woman about the groupon leading to the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> website but she tried to shut me down.",

They were right; there was great variety and something for everybody.  The staff is very sensitive to dietary restrictions and were happy to accommodate the person in our party with a gluten allergy.  When I ordered, I naturally had a lot of questions being not so familiar with this type of cuisine, but the girls behind the counter were knowledgeable and patient when answering me (and just so sweet).  The food was phenomenal!  It was so fresh and they were very generous with their portions.  I was curious and tried their housemade cucumber drink and I highly recommend it!

The serving size was generous enough that I could've made two meals of it - and shoud've, but didn't.  If I lived in Vegas I'd likely eat here at least once a week, and would probably get the exact same thing each time.",

    "text": "We found a pretty good deal on Groupon so went out there to try them out. First off, the portion amount is pretty insane. Not so much that you want to kill yourself afterwards, but bf and I were struggling to finish our bowl and wrap. After trying out Halal Guys a few weeks ago with an underwhelming outcome, we were glad we came here. I don't even really like chicken, but the chicken here is very tender and moist, not dry at all. And compared with Halal Guys, you get a real salad that's already dressed, and many other free toppings such as red cabbage, onions, parsley, tomatoes, tzatziki or tahini, spicy sauces, etc, and some extra charge toppings. For the most part, the extra charge toppings are on the left side, free toppings on the right.  We also got a beef wrap and the lavash bread is so good! They make it a point to tell you it's not a tortilla, and I think I remember the owner saying they make it thenselves, though not sure if that's True. Anyway it was good.  They have two hot sauces here. Not as hot as the red sauce at Halal Guys (thank god!) but even their green mild sauce has a nice kick to it. But honestly, unless you are one of those people that have to have hot on everything, the food here doesn't really need anything more.  If you're unsure of what to order, ask for a sample. They will most likely try to give you a sample of something anyway.  Without the Groupon, most entrees are about $9-10, but it will be a very filling meal. No need to add on a side unless you are sharing an entree. Usually we try to not overeat, but we can put away quite a bit when we want to. We ate until the point of fullness, but then there wasn't enough leftover for it to make sense to take home, so we ended up powering through and finished it all. So worth it!",

I basically order the hummus shawarma bowl with a side of meat. I then ordered a combo with drink and pitta chips and more hummus. It was hummus overload. The shawarma was okay nothing  that popped in flavors. It was my fault that I ordered a hummus bowl, I think it's better to order a regular bowl with rice and then combo it and you'll get hummus any ways with the pita chips. The only thing that was good was the cucumber cooler that was refreshing. Overall it was ok, the free checking for dessert on Yelp is a choice of bakalava but it's way too sweet for me.   Maybe I'd give it another try but the flavors were to mono.",

I would always pass by the restaurant and never thought twice about it, but I'm glad I stopped back a few months ago for the first time!   If anything I would say they need to work on customer service and quality of service. Sometimes the staff is extremely friendly and hospitable other days it's like what did I walk into?! I've been here about five times now and it's just totally unpredictable what type of service you'll get.   Other than their service THE FOOD IS AMAZING!! Minus the fact that you pay extra for a lot of the sides, you get a lot for what it's worth! I pay $14 for my beef shawarma bowl with salad, rice, chick peas, quinoa, feta, tzaziki (?) & hummus. It's bowl that takes me two sittings to finish because it's a pretty big size. I have yet to try anything else on the menu, I pretty much just go for my usual.   Side note: they usually cook the kabobs fresh to order so it does take a while (between 5-15mins depending if they already had extras on the grill). So it'd be smart to order ahead so that you don't wait too long!",

A big pile of rice and a whole lot of curry for a pretty decent price.  A little bit on the spicy side, but it was satisfying.  My husband had the salad and they were heavy handed with the dressing, so try to ask for light dressing.  The meat was tender, and all the flavors were surprisingly good.    This is casual dine in area and it was packed.  So, I guess the food speaks for itself.  We just happen to be in the neighbor and it was definitely worth the stop.",

I asked how much longer and the lady at the register said they were making it as we speak. That wasn't the case, other people were still getting their food and finally I see my order being prepared.

When I came in and ordered the older lady kept asking me what I want. She kept repeating asking over and over again if I wanted to add more items or anything else. I kept saying no I just want to order these two items and I had to explain to her it was my first time here. So food took a while since they had to cook the kabob. When I went to go check out she literally asked me if I wanted to add a drink like 4 times and my answer was still no because I already had a drink. Then she told me my total was $15.16 and I gave her my Groupon which is worth $16. She scan the Groupon and then she goes you owe me $1.36 more after tax. And I go I'm confused you told me the grand total was $15.16 and now after I show you the Groupon you want to add more tax? I think she was upset that I used a Groupon but the ladies before me used groupons too. So I gave her my debit card to charge the $1.36 (tax according to her) and she goes you don't have cash? And I'm like no and then she hands me back my debit card without charging me the $1.36  and just walks completely away from me. So I took my to go food and went home. I wasn't a huge fan of the food either. The salad was lacking dressing and seasoning. The kabob was ok. I would not be coming back or trying it again.",

It takes longer to cook because it's cooked on a skewer on the grill fresh made to order, and the other kind of chicken and beef is shaved off a rotating skewer so it's less fresh. Plus it's the same price and the quality is much better with the skewer, in my opinion. If you order it in bowl form, which is the best way to get it, they put rice salad any extra veggies you want and the meat of your choice. It is a huge portion and always gets me full. It's also pretty healthy. I like to add kalamata olives and babaganoush (roasted eggplants with the consistency similar to hummus). Also Each add on is around a dollar which is totally worth it! They also have this delicious cucumber water drink. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. I come in here at least once a week I always crave it now.",

Initial impressions weren't all that great but perhaps it was timing, location etc. We were there on a Thursday evening around 7pm, seating which is minimal inside, was nearly full and the service was slow. There were only two people ahead of us but we waited in line awhile before our order was taken. I had a very difficult time hearing the employee making my food due to the background noise and her soft spoken voice, I kept having to lean over the glass and asking her to repeat herself so in the end I wasn't entirely certain what all the options were or what made it on the Kobe steak wrap I ordered. Overall the food was good, not great. I ordered the Kobe steak wrap and was surprised at how large it was! Definitely more food than I could eat in one sitting. My wife ordered the curry bowl. It was decent, a bit on the spicy side (for her) so she didn't end up finishing it. Price was good for the amount of food you get.",

If you've heard bad things about the other location (which I can not corroborate) then it is still definitely worth your time to come to this location.  There were four of us, and we tried four different things. The beef and chicken curries is what I got, as well as pita chips and hummus. The curries are amazing, and the hummus is very good. It doesn't take top spot for best I've had, but it's definitely ranked very very highly. That was quite surprising for me, as this is basically Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I didn't expect hummus this well executed from a place like that.   I think that actually sums up anything else I could say: I had a certain level of expectation for this place and it blew that expectation out of the water. The food was great, worth well above what they're charging. This is restaurant-quality food at fast-food prices.   I will, without a doubt, be back here quite regularly. I can't think of a better endorsement than to become a regular.",

The best part is Parsley is located not only in the same shopping mall as my gym (24hr fitness) but close to the house. I use to frequent the Starbucks next door just thought of that space as loan business. Talk about turning lemon into superstar. The whole interior is brand new built everything up that I can tell from my last memories. It pleasant atmosphere to chill over lunch or dinner. I stopped by for late recovery lunch after long bike ride. First impression truthfully this was loan office with desks now more upscale look, open kitchen, the book shelves hanging on the wall for decor on one side, and any business with yelp logo hand painted that worth star by itself. They have couple long community tables with bar stools, couple seats at one end of the open kitchen can see magic goes on in the kitchen, and regular tables plus few table outside can chill enjoy your meal. Each table the basic condiments real nice set up. I love the vibe of the restaurant.   I ordered the Chicken Shish Kabob Plate. Talk about loaded plate of goodies. The chicken skewers they cook fresh to order. They do tell you in advance that going take few minutes. It came with rice and mediterranean salad. The marinated carrots (sure they name but forgot) that was star that never expected. The carrots had amazing depth of flavor with the seasoning on it and just refreshing carrots stick could munch on all day. The chicken once cooked was tasty. It was cooked perfection nice and moist/hot on the inside. The sauce on top perfect compliment round out the flavor of the chicken. The plate also comes with warm pita bread. I also ordered side of hummus. Mediterranean got have me some Hummus. Talk about tasty Hummus. Hummus and Pita bread. Devine. The Hummus spot on best had in Vegas.  They even server cucumber chiller or basically cucumber water. I am not fan of but nice option to have instead of soda. I really like the set up for it.   The staff is super friendly, helpful, and made the first experience great one. They have lot of healthy options also! They have on board on the menu that all vegan. Parsley is place that plan on coming back and if anyone looking for bite to eat once done working out at 24hr Parsley solid choice...",

    "text": "We decided to come back here the 2nd time around because although the food was mediocre, their beef kabob wasn't really chunks of beef but rather more like a beef meatball, we got great customer service the first time. So, I wanted to try their chicken kabob plate and come back for their cucumber chiller which was pretty good.  But as we walked in, the male hispanic employee behind the counter did not even smile nor greet us. He asked what we would like in a cold and bored tone of voice. I told him I wanted the chicken kabob plate and a regular beef wrap.  As he started to prepare our wrap, he asked if it was for here or to go. When I said it was for to go, he rolled his eyes as if it was an extra effort to get a to go box which was just placed underneath the counter. But I ignored his arrogance and continued to pick the sides I wanted with my order.  Then I saw him plating my chicken \"kabob\" order and instead of it being a kabob, he put in the shredded chicken that is used on wraps. So, of course I reiterated my order. He then picked off the shredded chicken off with his bare hands and said, \"it will be another 15 minutes if you get the chicken kabob\". At this point, i was so disgusted with this guy's attitude and told him to cancel that order and I would just pay for the steak wrap. Rather than apologizing for not getting my order right, he then proceeded to shake his head and told me it was messed up as they have already prepared the order.   To make the long story short, I walked out of there with my steak wrap and told him I did not care whether it took hours to prepare my other order because I will not pay for it after the rude gesture and unsanitary circumstances that he just displayed.  It is a shame that in spite of how good your food may be, or how nice your restaurant is, one bad employee can drive away customers. So, to the owner of this restaurant, you might want to send this employee for further training on how to deliver good customer service and sanitation. He brings negative vibe to your business and clearly shows he does not like his job! You don't want to be the next restaurant to be featured on Dirty Dining",

As a quick disclaimer - I am NOT a big fan of \"Mediterranean\" / Greek (basic) foods. Having that in mind I thought my 'Steak Shawarma Plate' was A-OK. Nothing very special about it and it did not sway me to reconsider \"Mediterranean\" foods. I did not pick the place, I was just along for the ride.   I found the food to lean towards the bland side. Those with me enjoyed their meals more than I did; and would probably give this a 4 star rating. But, hey, it's my Yelp account! Would I eat here again? Sure. Would I choose to eat here again? Very doubtful. However, if this is the kind of food you enjoy - try it out for yourself!",

They also provide great options for vegans and vegetarians such as falafel, hummus, roasted eggplant, babaganosh, tabouli, and greek salad. We ordered BBQ Baguette - Steak with lightly toasted baguette, steak shawarma, BBQ sauce and mediterranean salad. And also Parsley Nachos - Chicken that has homemade pita chips, chicken shawarma, onions, tomatoes, tzatziki, feta cheese. Their cucumber drinks was really refreshing and healthy as well.

    "text": "Was just visiting Vegas for a week. I really appreciate that they have nice covered outdoor seating here (hard to find in the area). The inside also has small tables, larger tables, and a nice long table/barstool seating that's great for working on a laptop, etc.  I ordered the chicken shiskabob bowl, and added their new red quinoa. Over all it was all delicious. I also really enjoyed their cucumber drink, and it's pretty affordable for $2 (I was able to refill it also, not sure how much that's encouraged). The Starbucks and other place next door were $3+ for one small cup of juice, so I felt this place was a great buy. I personally had no problem with the pita bread or anything else I ate here- I'm also usually pretty picky about chicken and I thought their chicken was Excellent. I would go again!",

    "text": "This is an amazing new Mediterranean fast food restaurant - Chipotle/Subway style of ordering.   The place is well decorated, clean, modern and there's good radio (hits) music playing (not the greek or arabic music you hear at other places).  The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is self service. The prices are super low. A small chicken wrap is $6.49 and the regular (their large) is $7.99. And the small one is not small at all.  And you get to choose your meat and veggies and sauces like you do at Subway. Unlike most other places who only offer tge thicker pita bread, here they have the thinner one, which I like better. You can also choose white or wheat bread.  I got a regular white chicken shawarma wrap with  ther vegy salad which is amazing and added parsley (hey, it's their name), garlic spread and tzatziki sauce. They'll ask you if you want hummus, but I told them no, and got the tzatziki instead of the hummus - so it's your choice, and I recommend you donthe same. Tzatziki sause is basically a dill yoghurt sauce used for wraps and pita breads, and in my opinion goes better with the chicken shawarma. Chicken shawarma is rotisserie grilled chicken on a typical Mediterranean rotating grill and is cut in small pieces. The wrap was amazing. The chicken is fresh and tasty. They do season it slightly and it tastes amazing.   I also tried their home made \"special recepie\" cucumber chiller drink  ($1.99). It's very refreshing, try it!  This is probably my favorite Mediterranean food place in town now. For the price and quality it is simply amazing! Try it!",

You choose a meat, a type of bread and whatever you want on top. I got the steak and it was great! Flavorful and tender meat. The vegetables were fresh too. The babaganoush wasn't my favorite but they do give you quite a hefty portion.   Definitely try out their cucumber drink while you're there too. Perfectly refreshing for a hot Las Vegas summer day and for dessert you must try their perfectly flaky baklava. Yum!",

    "text": "We came here on a Wednesday night for a quick bite to eat prior to watching a movie. We'd pass by this place many times on our way to the gym, so I was excited to try it! When we first walked in, I noticed how clean the place was. The bathroom was nice and the toilet paper was thick and soft, which is surprising for a fast food type place. Furthermore, the service was good except the guy who was handling our order was in a rush and made our order wrong... But it's okay. The dinner rush can be rough when there's a lot of people coming by for dinner!   FOOD: Imagine a Chipotle style food bar where you tell the associate what you'd like. I had the falafal bowl and my husband has the steak bowl. The food was okay. The falafal was cripsy. I added the hummus in my bowl, which was tasty. BEWARE - the green mild sauce is pretty spicy! The red hot sauce just taste hot and lacks flavor. The steak lacked taste. I believe there are better Mediterranean places around town to try with better food and service.  If you check-in, you get a free dessert. They baklava was small. We got the almond one, which was okay.   PRICE: For our two bowls and the free dessert it was around $20, which is fair. The portions was pretty big and I had to take half of it home so it was great value.   Overall, I give it a 3-star since everything was okay. I probably would not come back though.   Happy Dining,   JT",

He had snatched a Groupon weeks prior and I had been itching to try this place out. \"It's like a Mediterranean Chipotle\", he would say. SO WHAT THE HECK IS TAKING US SO LONG TO TRY IT?!, I would think.   Chicken Bowl, bruh. Deliciousness. Salad, rice, chicken shawarma and your choice of toppings. For him? Steak nachos. And by \"nachos\" they mean awesomely seasoned fried pita chips. By the end of our meal time I had wished I ordered his instead. We made both our orders \"combos\", one with a small order of the eggplant salad which was yummo and the other with parsley fries which were pretty addicting.   This is likely going to be my go-to I-really-don't-feel-like-cooking choice of fast food establishments. Best part? Guiltless! It helps that the guys behind the counter were informative and helpful. You could tell they want to make sure you walk away happy, which was...different. ;)",

The set up is cute, has a nice covered patio and plays a little music. I got a chicken Shish kabob plate with an extra kabob. It was amazing and I'm so full I had to take a box home.

He asked another worker and the worker said it was okay to do so. He still didn't understand me. He gave me a salad with no rice. Then gave me rice with meat and no salad. Then tried to combine both rice plates into one when I asked for two separate. If you're confused by now, this was how I felt too. I don't know how else to simply state i wanted two plates with the meat and rice separate from the salad. Please train your workers or at least have more workers working. Placing an order especially in an assembly line type restaurant like this one should not have to take 10 min especially with me being the only person there!  Food was mediocre. I've had better Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. The chicken schwarma was way better than the beef in my opinion. It was more moist. Top it with some cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, garbanzo beans, and taziki sauce and you have yourself a meal.",

Parsley is served \"Chipotle Style\" aka, you pick your meat (Chicken or Shawarma,) you pick your style (Wrap/Bowl/Salad) and then you build accordingly.   The line clipped along quickly for it being lunch hour; about 15 minutes from wait time to checkout and although I'm not much of a \"salad for lunch\" kinda girl, I ate about half and was perfectly full. Not only that, it was absolutely delicious! The lettuce was crisp, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the topping all looked (and tasted) fresh! I was a little hesitant to try their baklava, primarily because it often tends to be too dense and syrupy, but theirs was a great combination of flaky, sweet and crunchy.  If you have enough forethought, you can also order ahead for pick up through their app!   This is such a quick, healthy, affordable alternative dining option that I know I will be back. The fact that I could eat a filling meal for less than $10.00 (and feel good about my choice) is awesome. The fact that I could make their bowl into two meals instead of one makes me do a happy dance.   I can't wait to come back!",

When I walked in I was greeted right away and offered to ask any questions on the menu! Great service already and the transaction barley even started! I was impressed! So after gazing at this menu for about 5 minutes I finally decided to go with the Chicken Parsley Bowl! Yum! As I was watching the employee put together this bowl I noticed how fresh the ingredients were and I was adding stuff I never even heard of because I'm a risk taker like that! Glad I did because the entire bowl was amazing! The bowl is completely worth the ($8.49) and I'm not going to lie before I ordered this I said to myself this better be good for the price!

Either way, this one I come to regularly, kicking myself for waiting so long.  Menu can be confusing for first-timers: mostly a Chipotle-style setup, with some featured dishes and specials. Wish menu was more clear about what ingredients come in what dish by default, so you know what you're adding on or omitting, but staff are generally good about walking you through the steps.  The hummus bowl is a favorite, chicken preferred, especially if you want high-protein. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to keep well for takeout/reheating. The wraps are easily shareable, or enough for multiple meals- pack yours with everything you want, staff miraculously always manage to make it close! Don't forget the feta and tabouli. Salads are decent but not my favorite, falafel is inconsistent (at times dry inside and/or oily outside).  Staff I've encountered are typically polite, informative, and efficient. I like how serving spoons for feta, tabouli, etc are regular, full-size spoons rather than the stingy measuring spoons I encountered on my visit to the other location referenced above and you are only charged for additional toppings (ie more than one serving)... or at least, that's my experience. Mixed info in other reviews suggests this may not be consistent.",

I decided to order a bowl with chicken shawerma. I wish they added more sauce to the bowl because it can get dry with just the shawerma and rice. It was more of a healthy option than the typical shawerma places. The bowl also included some pita bread. Overall it was good service and good food.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Babaganoosh Eggplant Salad Chicken Hummus Shawarma Bowl with Tzatziki Falafel Side with Tahini Warm Pita Baklava  Like many Las Vegas Restaurants, Parsley Modern Mediterranean began with the passion of immigrants, a man from Israel and his British wife originally meeting in Southern California before coming to Sin City and opening their first outpost in 2011, a second on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard added in 2015 and both continuing to operate under a business model based on tradition, affordability and healthiness.  Originally envisioned in the form of a Mediterranean Street Food stand back in Los Angeles, the concept reshaped into a quick-casual Restaurant with a focus on bold flavors featuring all-natural ingredients upon opening the first location on South Pecos, it was Saturday evening around Six o'clock that a visit was paid to Parsley Modern Mediterranean #2 on West Tropicana Avenue, the narrow space about 2/3 full with kids on their way to EDC as well as a couple of local families while two women and a man worked the counter.  Described by one fan as a \"Greek Chipotle,\" and favored by a respected local Chef as one of his go-to spots for healthy food, patrons approaching the counter at Parsley are directed to the end furthest the door in order to place an order, the idea a fairly simple one with three Proteins plus Falafel offered as everything from Bowls to Pitas or Platters, several traditional Dips and Side Dishes also available along with Baklava and Fountain Soda.  Fairly light in decor, a few Bookshelves and a mounted rack of Mediterranean Spices the only ornamentation aside from reclaimed wood and tile, it was after some perusal that the decision was made to order as wide a variety as possible with a focus on tasting, a bit of strategy allowing one to taste four Dips, a salad and two of the four 'Entrees' plus Dessert for under eighteen dollars.  Serving many of the traditional Foods one might expect to find at their local Greek restaurant, everything but the Panini-press warmed Pita Bread made in house daily, it was with 80% of the order in hand that a table was found directly across from the register, first bites of the spit-roasted Chicken noteworthy thanks to not only the juicy texture but also a bold hint of Herbs, the Hummus atop which it was situated a substantial portion dusted in Paprika and Parsley with tangy Tzatziki added at the end.  Taking a chance to unwrap the Pita, a second look at the menu later indicating that Parsley does indeed offer a housemade version for $1.00 more per piece, suffice it to say that the store-bought version does little to detract or add to either the smoothly pureed Chickpeas with a hint of Garlic or the smoky Babaganoosh bright with Lemon and Cumin while the Eggplant Salad is cool, slick and refreshing with thick-cut roasted chunks tossed in Tomatoes, Olive Oil and Peppers.  Told that the $3.99 side of six Falafel was owner Ygal's family recipe, the effort to fry them fresh appreciated even though the flattened shape led to a large surface area and thus a bit too much Oil, those who do not eat Meat are encouraged to taste the light green fritters for themselves with or without Tahini while anyone not on a diet would and without allergies would do well to finish with a small slice of Baklava available in many shapes, the traditional square featuring innumerable layers of Phyllo wrapped around ground Nuts and soaked in Honey.   ****A nearly perfect idea when accounting for location, nutrition, ingredients and price, Parsley Modern Mediterranean is the sort of idea America should be embracing instead of the suddenly 'clean' Panera or 1,000+ calorie Burritos, the menu well-culled and highly customizable with almost everything offered naturally low in fat and available by request without any added Oil.",

We were a little confused but helped through and I was incredibly happy to see the meat being cut right in front of me! (wow!!) As we moved through the line, the food began to look better and better. I ended up with a huge chicken shawarma salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, chick peas, jalapenos (very spicy!), rice, and some tzatziki sauce. It was delish! Made it a combo with pita, a drink and tabouli salad for my side. Overall, amazing meal and while it is a bit higher than a normal \"fast food\" dinner, you get a ton!",

It moves slower than the typical place that's set up like this but I think it's because you have more options. If there's a rush, you might have to wait awhile.   Everything I've tried here has been very good. I usually get the chicken plate with rice and salad. Best parts IMO are the tzatziki sauce and hot sauces. I also really like the falafel here because they are made to order - so they never taste stale or like they've been fried then sat around all day.",

However, you have one obvious problem: your employees. I have probably been to your place over 25 times this year - almost every time I come I see new employees - and it's almost always the same bad experience: super awkward, confused, slow employees that always look unhappy and run around like headless chickens. I just left your restaurant now - there were 7 (!!!!) people behind the line, I assume some were in training - and I was the only costumer ordering - and service was still very bad. Your service should be like chipotle - fast, efficient and clean. Instead, the simple task of literally putting rice and meat in a bowl takes your employees about 5-6 minutes per person. That's a lot of time for plating rice.   I have been in the restaurant business in the past, I know hiring is hard - but you guys can do a lot better than this, I'm sure. It's a shame that poor management ruins the entire experience and literally makes me feel angry and frustrated every time I visit. Hire a new manager guys - who ever is managing your place right now has very poor management skills.  Good luck",

    "text": "This is the best Mediterranean fast food restaurant in town! Oh Parsley, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways: 1.  The food is fresh, temperature appropriate and absolutely delicious! 2. Rosie.....Rosie!!! ROSIE!!!! We love Rosie so hopefully she will be working when you come in. Rosie has a wonderfully vibrant personality. She is very pleasant and helpful. She has a terrific sense of humor and a genuine smile that could melt hearts. The hubby and I both had a bit of a rough day so stopping for Parsley on the way home from work was meant to be our treat to turn the day around. The food is great but it was Rosie's friendliness that made the difference for both us tonight. Rosie: if you ever happen to read this, you really made us happy tonight. We live in a world in which everyone is in a hurry and some find it to daunting of a task to smile at someone.. Not you, you singlehandedly make up for so many grouchy  others. You really turned the mood around for us. You are gifted to be able to spread cheer so easily. Thank you so much! I feel so lucky to have stopped in tonight. A lovely interaction with you was just what we needed.  3. This place is cute. Small-ish but very clean and inviting. 4. The prices are good and the portions are quite large.  5.  We watched as one of the crew checked and documented the Temps on all of the food on a very detailed log. This was great to see. I like to know that Darcy Spears has no reason to walk in when I am eating somewhere. LOL  6. The food really is great here. It is very fresh and made in front of you. But, it is also HEALTHY. I always have a chicken shwarma salad and I feel like all of the food mistakes of the past week or two are instantly erased. It feels good to eat here. Does that make sense? If not, it's because you haven't been here yet.   Go to Parsley. Now. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, (you won't need it because the food is priced well). Go. What are you waiting for? An invitation? Okay  I  want to personally invite you to check out all that Parsley has to offer. Say hi to Rosie for us and don't forget to tell her how great she is. People need to hear when they are doing something well.",

I love the inside- it's decorated well and I love the tables and chairs. Also outside seating too which is where we usually sit.   Prices are totally decent and they have a great variety. You can choose a bowl, salad, sandwich... It's chipotle style but with fresh Mediterranean style food. They have all veggies you could want, in additional to salsas, hummus, tahini, greek yogurt. The portions are really big (definitely lasts me two meals) and the flavors are so good. I usually get a bowl which is over rice and salad (similar to chipotle) but i am eager to try their sandwiches which come on a baguette and look so good. I think a large baguette sandwich is like 8.00 which isnt really much more than a footlong at Subway but with real fresh ingredients. Also I dont know how they make their pita-chips  but they're like crack. so good.  Employees are always really nice and helpful. Their soda is super carbonated and the green cucumber drink they have is so refreshing. I love this place.",

The customers before us had several issues with the soda machine being out & just being carbonated water. The cashier told them to try something else but they wanted a specific drink. After a little back & forth the cashier just gave them a bottled coke product but it was very unprofessional hearing them argue with the customers in front of everyone.   I do love the food here & the cucumber cooler drink is so refreshing, especially with our crazy Vegas heat. I'm big on customer service, so not sure if I'll be back again but possibly since the food was very good.",

Menu: Choose a bowl, salad, sandwich...with chipotle-style assembly process Portions: Pretty big (could be split up into two meals...but I usually just indulge and finish it while I'm there).  The green cucumber drink  is refreshing and pairs well with their food.  Near perfect rating due to my most recent visit...not sure if the employees were new but I had to ask them about missing parts to my order (pita, veggies, etc). If it were my first time at Parsley, I don't think I would've returned based on that experience (as I wouldn't have gotten what I paid for).",

I went in on 3/26/2018 at abt 6:30pm and ordered two beef kabob bowls.  A shorter young brown hair girl prepared the bowls for me.  As I was choosing my toppings I could see she was getting frustrated with me.  Like I was inconveniencing her.  She started having this terrible attitude as to tell me hurry the _ _ck up.    When she was done making my bowls I asked for the extra chili sauce on the side.  This is a sauce that comes on the bowl.  And it's a sauce I've asked for extra on the side many times.  It's a sauce that people come up to the counter and just ask for when they want more of.    So she looks at me and with a rude tone says, \"ya but I'm gonna charge u for it!\"  I was so shocked by how she said it, I just nodded.  She ended up charging me a dollar for a miniature plastic cup of sauce.  Crazy!  Update:  The owner replied to my post right away and offered to make it right.  He said he would deal with the customer service issue and make it up to me.  This is very cool because I really like eating here and now I know the owners really care about their customers.",

You can make your salad, plate (rice on the side), or bowl (rice and salad together) here. The notable things to get is beef or chicken shawarma but you can also choose wraps, shawarma and hummus, and even curry.   My favorite thing to get is the chicken shawarma plate with salad on the side and hummus for an extra $1. If you haven't tried their shawarma, now's the best time to get it. It's juicy, tender, and straight up delicious to the taste buds. You can see them shaving it off as it's slowly roasted which gives it a nice touch. Pair it with hummus, and I can't think of any other way to heighten the flavors.   I'be also tried the curry but I wasn't a fan of it. Nothing notable about the flavor but the saltiness of it. Which reminds me, is their authentic curry in Mediterranean food? I don't think so, but correct me if I'm wrong.   Service: I'm not a fan, honestly. They never smile, and they always look stressed out. If you can look passed the service, I think you could enjoy the food, but for the most part, think fast food service. They're probably want you out of their face ASAP.   Overall, I would come back. It's delicious, fast, and probably a healthy option under a few circumstances.",

So what is it? The place tries to cater to too many facets, healthy, middle eastern, vegan....and so on, at the end of the day you get food (while it might be healthy and fresh)...but flavor less, not True to the source. Tried the \"curry\".. missing some major key ingredients like lemongrass and is missing any heat what so ever. tried the Shawarma...its ok...but not spiced properly, nothing I'll ever order again....or come here again for that matter... Conclusion: if you are looking for authentic middle eastern cuisine this is not it. what is it?....I don't know.

I highly recommend ordering this!  -Steak Shawarma wrap all their amazing tasty goodies all wrapped up in their huge flat bread (you must have it with their spicy carrots. This will be the best thing you'll eat!  -And then there is their Cucumber Chiller drink. The perfect amount of cucumber flavor and sweetness at the perfect chill ever!  All in all if you haven't been here you must come here. You will not disappointed in fact you might be addicted.

Here's the gist of it though: choose your meat (chicken/steak/kabobs/vegetarian) and how you want it (bowl, plate, wrap, or salad). Bowls include salad, rice, & meat and spicy pickles carrots. Add on items such as other salads or toppings are $1 extra. Plates are like bowls, but the items are just separated.. Other options are available too, like chicken curry or baguette sandwiches. Add about $2-4 to get a drink and a side like parsley fries or hummus.  After an explanation of the menu by the nice owner, my boyfriend settled on a steak bowl and me a chicken bowl. We had a tzatziki sauce on our bowls, which looked beautiful!  The taste was a tad disappointing though. I expected a stronger flavor from the tzatziki. Meats were lacking in flavor and quite dry, but hopefully that's because we came in late at night. The dish needed something more flavorful. The parsley fries were the star- crunchy skin and soft inside.  Nothing to wow me here, but it was worth a try!",

I got the steak wrap and was actually pretty put off by the gristley nature of the steak. It was tough to in some places. I just couldn't eat it. This is where I'm torn, the older man (maybe manager, maybe owner) was so gracious about my complaint and returned my money immediately. Also my son's chicken (from the rotiserrie rack) and rice was good.  I would come back but would need to try other things.",

There was a big crowd but the people behind the counter were working hard to get people through the line. They were courteous and didn't make you feel rushed. We also got a small baklava dessert and it was super good. Overall, we would definitely come back!!",
