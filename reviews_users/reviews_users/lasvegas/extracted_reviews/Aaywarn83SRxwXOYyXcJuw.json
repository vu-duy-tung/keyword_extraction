Unfortunately they get a 2 from me.  The salad I got was $13.00, $16.00 in the end because I added avacado.  Open the box, no chicken.  Paid $16 for lettuce, vegetables, and tomatoes. Really really uncool guys.",

So we got our table, and ordered, then my husband realized he forgot his ID.  So he decided to run home and get it.  I was trying to find our waitress, to see if she would give him a pass!  By the time I caught up with her she said it was cool!  So I called the hubby, by then he was almost home!  (I could only imagine how fast he was driving without me in the car)  He ordered meatloaf and he loved it! This was his first visit to Claim Jumper.  I ordered the salmon....Mine was dry and boring!  I make better salmon at home!   Our waitress was really cool, the lemonade was really good!  Hubby said he will be back!  I think next time I will just order the pizza!",

All four of our party ordered steaks and when I order a steak that is nearly $30 I expect one that will fill you up, all of our steaks combined was what I expected, not the tiny steaks we got. I would be embarrassed as a restaurant to serve a steak that small for the price. My wife got the small steak but we could tell the difference, they were both very small! I don't mind paying for a good steak that is of reasonable size, but these were way too small for the price!",

The chop steak was SO SALTY! The demi-glace was delicious though. I really think that sauce made the meal come together. I was just disappointed how salty my steak was. I'm not a person who returns stuff, because I don't want my food messed with, so I just ate it without complaint. My bf ordered the chicken fried steak and it was HUGE. He is a big eater, but he couldn't even finish that. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, a burger and meatloaf. One thing to mention is they are no longer selling garlic bread. Instead, they bring a medium size roll with a marinara sauce brushed on top. It was ok, but nothing special.   I ordered the motherlode cake for dessert for all of us to share and that was amazing. Super chocolatey, decadent and rich. Yum. I would come back to this Claim Jumper, but I would order something different.",

Meatloaf dinner, quite tasty but not as good as their meatloaf sandwich they took off the menu a few years ago.  I hear they will still make it though if you ask politely.  Spinach artichoke dip, ehhh...  Widow maker burger, pretty tasty, expensive though but that's why you get it during happy hour!  Speaking of happy hour, not bad prices and a good selection although it could be a lot bigger.  Happy hour is only available in the bar area too which sucks because sometimes you have a big party that wants cheap food and drinks right?  I've had mixed experiences with the drinks here or rather how the drinks taste.  Sometimes they are on point, other times they are terrible.  Gotta be consistent!  Not bad for a local place but not somewhere I frequent.",

But this time we ordered takeout. Takeout service was fast. The takeout packaging was good. We went there to get the tenderloin tips with mashed potatoes but its not on the menu anymore. So I ordered rotisserie chicken ($17.99) which was very bland. I had much better rotisserie chicken from supermarket! The mashed potatoes were thick like concrete and flavorless, the gravy was very strong and unique tasting, vegetables were different too. I didn't even like the potato cheddar soup....had huge round pieces of carrots in it eww. Husband had clam chowder soup he said was okay. He had the meatloaf ($15.99) which was the weirdest meatloaf I've ever seen and he said it was terrible. The chocolate cake ($11.99, not a typo!) was huge and packaged in a nice box but hubby said it was terrible. Total was $52.25 (LOL!)....we got ripped off.",

I asked for a vinaigrette for my salad, and I was brought a balsamic reduction/glaze. Way too sticky to dress a salad. The manager came by our table and did not offer to fix anything. He also looked very unprofessional. The food is way overpriced for the quality and portion sizes. Everyone had to ask for drink refills. I won't be going here again.",

Her Dr. Pepper didn't even taste like a flat Mr. Pibb so no idea what the drink was.  I had the shrimp Fresca. Which I thought meant fresh? Not so much. The spinach for having been cooked and looking dreadful, was very chewy. The \"parmesan\" crusted shrimp tasted more like shaken 'n bake.  At least the bread was edible.

We had the Spinach Artichoke dish ($11.99 which we had before and it was good), but now it just tasted really bad and weird.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce or what -- but it was not edible. I tried their Potato Skins ($10.99) which was just 1 whole Potato and 1/2 each half was cut into 4 small pieces and put around a large dip saucer in the middle (see pic) so that it would look like more.  It was so boring and bland (no taste except for some bacon bits), that it had to be drowned in the sauce / dip (now I knew why the saucer was so big) to have any flavor!   RESULTS: A really bad tummy ache and upset stomach that didn't digest the food!   WARNING:  Don't go here! Don't eat here!

Apparently half my group knows the manager Maris, and this lady took great care of us.  The service was very good to handle 13 people; our waiter came by to refill drinks and everyone seemed to need something on the side and he still brought requested items back in a timely fashion. Here is the clinker...when I was ordering, the waiter told me I ordered one of the healthiest dishes on the menu (not True..haha).  I know these chain restaurants are notorious for bad-for-you food, but until the person next to me found nutritional information on the table, I was in the dark.   *Bravo to Claim Jumper for publishing the nutritional information for every menu item and putting it on the table.  This is great for diabetics, etc and is actually quite impressive. *It is my psychological problem that I felt the need to look at it once I knew it was there, and learned that 99% of the menu items had more than any human's (besides sumo wrestlers or Michael Phelps) caloric intake, 600 times the sodium intake, etc.  I was frightened when I saw my order's nutrition so I just ate half and then walked for hours after at the District, and am eating a lean cuisine right now. *Like everyone else said, the menu is huge with lots of choices, but the food is nothing spectacular. *The mango iced tea is unsweetened and yummy. *MAJOR bravo for the vegetarian menu.  Most of my group eats vegetarian out and even as regulars, did not know about this.  You have to ask for it but there are tons of veggie options! *summary: good service, average food, nice ambiance, kudos for published albeit scary nutritional info, brownie points for veggie menu  UPDATE 11/18/09: Tilapia Veracruz is awesome.  I never usually eat tilapia but this is zesty, rich in flavor, and has avocado! mmm!",

    "text": "After visiting last night & finding out corporate had removed so many things from the menu I was really bummed.  But I went ahead & ordered my favorite thing on the menu...the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich.  When it arrived, it was HALF the size it normally is.  I soon discovered why!  The wonderful slaw/lettuce mix they had always used & added so much to the sandwich, was now changed to crappy & plain ole lettuce.  I was NOT happy in the least.  Fast forward to lunch today when I took my other half of the sandwich for left overs.  Imagine my shock when I bit down on a chicken BONE!!!  It freakin broke my molar tooth.  Then I found 2 more hard white bone grisle pieces that had been mixed into the Chicken Salad Mixture.  I just sent the Corporate office a nasty gram via email.  I had BETTER hear back from someone.  I do have to say, the waiter (cant remember his name) was really great & explained that corporate just made all these changes to bring Claim Jumper out of the 1980's.  Apparently, Claim Jumper was just purchased by some other corporation & decided to change things.  I will NOT return to the Green Valley Parkway location ever again.  I normally go to the Summerlin location.  I may never return at all.  It is such a shame because Claim Jumper has always been one of my favorite places to eat.  I do have to say, the new onion rings were delicious.  I guess they had been previously frozen like the fried zucchini.  Now they are hand battered & made fresh.  That was the only good change corporate has made.  If it wasn't broke, why fix it???",

I'll post a pic of what I scrapped off it. ( Pic. is next to my profile pic. ) To start the waiter was da da duh....we asked for ( No lemon ) in our water and yep...you guessed it lemon. He said: i couldn't remember if you wanted lemon or not so i put it on there for you. I said: we told you 30 seconds ago, glad we are not allergic to it!!  First nose dive...Appetizer was good had the roasted artichoke ( bout the only thing they know how to make ).  Then the dreaded  so-called food came.  Waiter forgot her bread that comes with it, and no gravy poured on the tri-tip.  Mine looked like it came from a cow patty field in Jasper Oklahoma!!!  I really didn't want to even eat it.  I think a two year old could have done a better job at making it rather than them.  What makes me wonder is how this place stays in business!  No disrespect to other people but, I think they don't know what \"GOOD FOOD IS\".  If I was the health department I would shut this place down in a heartbeat for awful tasting wanna be food.    Overall rating:  - F -F -F -F -F   five minus F's!!!!!!   ( i wish they had a food sucks rating )  To sum it up...We will NEVER step foot in there ever again!!!!     (   THANK GOD!!!!  )",

It took about 25 minutes to be seated...but we counted at least 9 unoccupied tables and 40 unoccupied seats in the area we were seated. I Ordered the Steak Chili Baker.  Bread was hot.  The Chili inside - STONE COLD.  Like someone opened a can of .89 cents Chili from a shelf and and simply spooned it in.  The menu indicated it would be topped with \"Cheddar Cheese\", 3 small shreds of cheese. I tried 2 spoonfuls, the meal (if that's what Claim Jumper calls a meal), was sent back 98% untouched. When I told the server  it was cold, she simply said she would have it \"heated up\". This response is what made me furious. Manager came buy a few moments later with a most insincere apology and his only response was an attempt to sell me something else. The sales receipt shows \"Kitchen Error, COLD\" on it where they backed out the cost.  Cold either means not cooked, or cooked and then left out until room temperature. Either way, this is a health hazard.  I will be notifying Southern Nevada Health District.  UPDATE 3/15/2012 Both the Assistant Manager and the Manager called me (I submitted a complaint on the Claim Jumper Website) to offer their apologies and express how they will better coach their staff.",

Then when the food FINALLY came, they brought my nephew's grilled cheese last (and it came about 5 minutes after everyone's meals were brought).  Isn't it serving 101 to bring the kids food first??

The fish was overly seasoned and so needless to say, I got to taste of bit of everything and left unsatisfied and disappointed.  This dish came with a side dish and I ordered a cup of clam chowder that tasted like a cup of salt.  I just picked at the clams and left the whole cup of salt soup alone.     Not my plate of seafood, so I'm not coming back.  Next time, I'll stick with a much better option at The Cheesecake Factory.",

My wife, daughter and I decided to stop in and enjoy a drink and an appetizer this evening but unfortunately we were riddled with disappointment in our visit. We ordered the appetizer sampler which included spinach artichoke dip, fried zucchini, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks. When we got our order we did not recieve the correct appetizer. This one came with chicken wings, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and potato skins. Confused and still waiting on our bowl of clam chowder, we thought maybe they were still being cooked. We eventually received our clam chowder, which an advertisement at the entrance claimed to be \"the best clam chowder\"...that was a lie. (Awful clam chowder. Potatoes were under cooked and flavoress). I wish I had snapped a pic of their sign. Someone was severely misinformed on the taste of good clam chowder. Any ways back to our meal. The waitress proceeds to tell me when I ask for the menu and see what I ordered wasn't this dish, that she put the happy hour dish in for us because it was cheaper. Hold up, I didn't even know there was a happy hour dish and I sure didnt order anything off of this menu. Our irritation comes from the fact that someone decided to make a decision on our meal without consulting us and in turn replaced the 2 items we really wanted for to crappy items we didnt want and one we didnt even touch at all. Oh, and we came in for a family dinner at a place that claims it is open till 11pm but moves everyone to the bar area after 9pm, including families with small children. I'm sorry, no I do not want to have a TV in plain view of my table so we have any kind of distraction for our kid or our selves. If I wanted that I would have gone to Applebees. Maybe mentioning online that after a certain time there is only bar seating available would be nice. All in, in all it was a pretty crappy experience for a Friday night out at Claim Jumper.",

Compared to a similar dish at Chili's (Cajun Chicken Pasta), with a full chicken piece is on top of the pasta with thick cuts, CJ's was definitely inferior. That pretty much sums it up -- CJ's felt like a poor man's Chili's, despite charging a lot more. My server was quite friendly though, I will give them that.",

We had the zucchini sticks and onion rings to start, we also ordered their famous homemade strawberry lemonade and tropical tea (which are both bottomless btw). He also helped suggest a better way of ordering one of their lunch items for a better deal which my dad appreciated. We didn't save room for dessert, but it was my uncle's birthday and Dillon was nice enough to bring out a small dessert for us to try. I'm pretty sure it was a buttercake...whatever it was...it was SO GOOD, left my dad speechless.

    "text": "We arrived and asked for a table for 3 and was promptly escorted past many empty tables to the other side of the restaurant.  When ??, she said they were starting to fill a section for a new waiter who had just came on. OK, good enough.  Gabriel introduced himself and ask if we had been here before and did we have our rewards card.  Yes, to both.  They guys got a pitcher of beer and me an iced tea.  I love it when they bring a carafe so you can fill your own refills. He brought a hot loaf of bread but we had to ask for some butter.  Our large order of crispy parm zuchinni rings arrived quickly and we devoured all but 2.  2 of both ordered the clam chowder instead of a salad, but we had to ask twice for some hot sauce to spice it up a little.  Entrees took a while but the wait was ok while the app and soup settled.  Ignacio had the after the gold rush chicken marsala and enjoyed it but was unable to finish it.  Uriel had the calzon but it was missing the pepperoni and sausage he requested and only had cheese in it.  He returned it and nibbled from both of our plates, which was ok.  The manager came over and offered a free mile high chocolate cake for the mistake. I had the 7 oz steak and fried shrimp.  Steak was cooked perfect.  Shrimp were kind of soggy and cold.  I ate about half the large baked potato. We enjoyed our meal and took home the cake.  Gabriel was an attentive server and we look forward to our next visit but will not order so much next time.",

    "text": "If they say a picture is worth a thousand words, then these pictures should speak volumes.  I haven't been to a Claim Jumper in a couple of years.  I don't know why I stopped.  Maybe because I thought the food was just okay.    Upon my husband's insistence, we took my mother in law for dinner here since she has never been to one.  She absolutely loves The Cheesecake Factory so this was new to her.   Our server was really attentive.  The bread was good and the water was plentiful but pretty much ended at that unless you count the cake we took home which was okay.    I don't mind paying good $$$ for a good meal.  I work in the food industry. I have shelled out some decent money at The French Laundry.   But at least have some decency to have some ounce of truth in your advertising.  Or at least attempt to make the dishes you advertise look as advertised.  The salmon oscar was $29.99.  I asked for it to be medium rare and what came out was a 4-5 oz fish portion with a smattering of crab.  What a sad dish.    I have become more vocal of not accepting half the dish I ordered since I am certainly paying full price for it.  So I told the server my disappointment.  She sent the manager and he came over to ask if I would like anything else.  Mind you my companions are halfway through their meals already.  So I ordered the shrimp fresca.  I should have known from the previous event that it will absolutely NOT look like the picture but I took a chance.  Disappointment once again seized the chance to show me he was king!    You would think that the server would realize that I was disappointed in my dish since I refused to take the rest of it home.   But I guess we no longer train our service employees to read disappointment in the faces of our guests.    It will probably be another couple of years before I would ever go back to a Claim Jumper.  Probably NEVER.  I should have been more insistent on The Cheesecake Factory.",

At one point, I think they decided to raise the cow who eventually would give the milk to make the cheese for my dish from a calf - starting the whole process when I ordered. Then, when we got to the dessert course, the waiter straight-up lied to us and said that it was taking a long time because there was a big rush from the happy hour at the bar, when, in reality, they simply didn't have the dessert we'd ordered. Took almost 30 minutes for the manager to come out and TELL us that, by which time, we were already late for our evening plans.   I so wanted to like this one. Other Claim Jumpers to which I've gone don't have this problem. Front and back of house need a complete overhaul in staffing. When there's a total of 7 tables seated, it should not be 20 minutes between visits from your waiter. One should not have to make a pyramid of empty glasses on the table to make the point that we've run dry. If it didn't physically pain me not to leave a tip, I'd have left the dude a whopping zilch; as it is, what I left was out of pity - clearly, he'd not be able to get a job waiting tables anywhere else.",

I highly recommend the tri-tip sliders, street tacos and pretzels! All very good and all cheap to.   The service at the bar is solid to. I started to joke with the bartender that CJ was becoming my go to hang out place to grab a drink and food after work because the specials are just that good.

    "text": "We have been trying new places every Friday on Date night. Have not been to a Claim Jumper before so we gave it a try. Definitely on the \"won't do that again \" list.   Arrived about 8:30 it was pretty quiet and dark  inside. There was no wait which kind of made me wonder why on a Friday night. Walking past the food prep area two of the wait staff were laughing loudly after one dropped an F bomb in front of us. We were seated and we had a nice quiet meal that was on par with Denny's for a premium price. My salad was good other than they make croutons out of sweet corn bread. The combination of Blue Cheese dressing and yellow cake croutons was just wrong.  I ordered fish and chips because it's hard to mess that up. Wrong again. Over cooked fish jerky fried in rancid oil. All on a huge pile of soggy french fries. My wife got grilled shrimp and fillet Mignon. A different  waiter brought her plate and announced here's your sirloin and shrimp. He was told we ordered Fillet Mignon and grilled shrimp not Sirloin and Fried shrimp. He said Oh I think it's the same thing. No sirloin and fillet Mignon is not the same thing. He took the plate back to the kitchen. Our waiter came back and said whats the problem? We told her and she went to the kitchen and brought the same plate back with a side of grilled shrimp. I seated facing the kitchen and could see that her plate had not moved from when it was taken back. Now it had been sitting back there and was cold. Well we left knowing why it was nearly empty on a Friday night.",

    "text": "After working next door for a little over 2 yrs I became sort of a lunch connoisseur of this rustic eatery. I was always happy with the meals I got, but I did stick with what I knew for the most part. I mean let's face it there isn't THAT much opportunity to really get crazy and branch out here.  The salads in my opinion are great. Huge and if you get the lunch specials big portion for a great price. The portions of everything are massive so come hungry. The chicken pot pie is one of the best I've ever had. There is usually a good selection of soups including a yummy French Onion and Chicken Tortilla.   Dessert is a new level of portion size depending on what you get. At least LOOK at the dessert case as you walk in, just to stare in awe. The berry pies are awesome and if you get it to go there are instructions on how to warm it up best at home.   The service can vary from server to server. Sometimes they're at your beckoned call and other times it takes some flagging down to get attention. We almost always sat in the bar area so that could be part of the issue, it's a bit off the beaten path.   Given they have changed their menu around a bit since they were bought out by Landry's but I didn't notice a major change in selection or quality. With Landry's as their parent company if you join their discount club you can earn reward points at a wide range of restaurants.",

It has cornbread croutons and I promise you, if you are making a face right now, try this salad I bet  you'll want to have it again. This place is great to just kick back and relax.   They have a full bar. The staff is friendly, the lighting is low, and you really  don't feel like you spent a bunch of money when you have left.     There is something for everyone here.

    "text": "I've been to this location a couple of times and both experience was pretty good.  The serving of the food was pretty big which is great because it fit the price. The service has always been quite stellar, our server was always pretty great. The food, I would have to say is very good EVERY TIME.  Always up to a high standard.    Today, however, was a whole 'nother experience. We came in with a party of 8 (technically we asked for a table for 7, plus a high chair for my baby nephew) and we asked if their happy hour was still going on.  We were informed that it was and it was a self-serve area by the bar.  So we just put two tables together and no biggie.  When we walked in the waitress, Olivia, assisted in putting together the tables.  Keep in mind, we only came in here because Cheesecake Factory had a long wait time and we wanted some desserts ONLY. Also, we came in a whole HOUR before the place closed.  Nevertheless, we sat down and we became interested in their happy hour menu which was advertised, not only in their website,  but also all over their tables.  So we decided to add some appetizers to our order.  After ordering, we were informed that the Happy Hour prices are no longer valid, despite the fact that it's clearly stated on ALL their tables and we got a happy hour menu.  She said they just changed the policy that day.  And that the advertised Happy Hour is only valid during the REGULAR Football Season.  Is she stupid?  The REGULAR season is not over until the SUPER BOWL!!!! Uhm, OKAY.  So we placed our orders still and I went to check with the hostess, she got the manager and I spoke to her and she informed us that she will honor the happy hour prices.    Once we got our order, my sister accidentally spilled a bit of blue cheese in her coffee.  When I asked the waitress for a new cup, she ignored me.  When I asked for an extra bread for my nephew, who wanted more bread, she looked at me with an incredulous expression and paused to say, \"uhm, yeah...okay.\"  She comes back to refill my coffee (without any spoons distributed to us, AT ALL) and proceeded to refill my sister's drink SEEING that there's white stuff floating all over it.  This whole time, she would go back forth to the bar and whisper with the bartender and they would roll their eyes.    As she poured that coffee, I was astounded at her stupidity and her laziness.  I was just staring at her hoping she would notice and it would click that she should get a new cup.  NOTHING! She avoided eye contact with me and had this stupid smirk on her face like she's mocking us.  WHAT THE HELL!? I understand that she may be having a bad day, but proper customer service should still be practiced to keep professionalism intact.  Unfortunately, she had neither professionalism nor proper customer service etiquette.  I once again asked for the Manager and she could not even do anything but serve us the remainder of our order, in which time, my sister walked out because she couldn't take it anymore.  I have seen a lot of bad customer service in my time, but this has got to be the worst I have ever seen.  She should not be a waitress if she does not like having to wait on others.  It's absurd! It's insulting! And most importantly, it's unacceptable!! This will definitely not be the end of it.  We're great tippers as people who has worked previously in the service industry.  We know the value of a good service and we pay good money when we receive it.  But that service that we received did not even warrant a single penny.  They're lucky my brother in law is still very generous and still left a tip.  I cannot  believe that experience.    For a company that is under Landry's Inc., who claim that they are the leader in Dining and Hospitality, this kind of service is truly unacceptable.  It's abhorrent and just plain idiocy to have those kinds of servers employed at such a facility.  I will not go back to this location EVER.  Lastly, the hostess, provided better customer service and professionalism that the manager and the two servers we came across during this visit.  WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They totally ruined my sister's 17 years anniversary with her husband!",

    "text": "The only real highlight was the crew at the front reception counter. After that, total disappointment. What was to be a surprise visit and family get together, was nothing short of a waste of money and time. The waiter was in over his head from the start. Three tries to get a drink, first the ordered beer was discontinued, then the Dr Pepper was a flat root beer & finally a regular coke that tasted like a diet. The 3 cheese potatocakes came out cold and not crispy at all. The potatoes and gravy on the chicken fried chicken platter were both cold. The advertised \"flavorful\" potato cheddar soup was so bland and a gritty texture. The  kids grill cheese sandwiches were the best item ordered for the entire evening. The bill included the beer that didn't exist and when we tried to find out how the refund was made or if the charge was voided, the fiasco began. We then met the on duty manager who was able to explain what the waiter couldn't but just walked away when I tried to tell him thanks. Whoever is doing the hiring needs some better guidelines especially when it comes to upper management positions. This was my second trip to this location and it will be my last. My first email was to friends planning a reunion weekend get together to gracefully bow out since they decided on Claim Jumper for lunch. I try and give everyone the benefit of the doubt but tonight made me wonder why I didn't follow my gut feeling that the first time wasn't a fluke. We should have stopped at Sammy's a block away because it smokes this place by miles. This is the last place I would recommend to anyone I know and like.",

    "text": "I have to start with a disclaimer. Among the chain restaurants, I am partial to Claim Jumper ( you can look at my reviews of their restaurants in Town Square and Downtown Vegas which were positive). We were coming from the movies at Green Valley Ranch with friends and thought we would have an informal, after the movie, dinner at the nearby Claim Jumper. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. We got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately taking our drink orders and bringing the oversized croissant bread plate for the table. The bread was the highlight of the meal. When at Claim Jumper, I usually get one of their salads and my wife usually gets a simple hamburger (bun, burger,  bun). I wanted to try something different, so I ordered their jambalaya. Our friends ordered salad and a burger. My jambalaya came first. Few minutes later, the burgers came. And then the salad. My friend took one bite out of his burger and we had to start looking for the server to send it back. He found it so over salted that it was virtually not edible. My wife wanted her burger medium rare with nothing on it. It came medium well with lots of lettuce and tomato. The server said it must have been someone else's burger. My friends wife also had to return her salad. As to the jambalaya, it was a good sized portion of what looked like a plate of linguine with 6 shrimp on the perimeter. I did find two small pieces of what looked like luncheon meat chicken mixed in with the pasta. There was absolutely no sausage. There were no vegetables that I could find. In my experience, jambalaya should have some kick to it. This was absolutely bland. I can't say that the dish was bad. But it certainly wasn't good. And it certainly wasn't anything that I would call jambalaya. They did make good on my friend's burger as well as my wife's burger. But they were brought to the table separately much later,  well after I had finished my meal. The salad came back even later than that. So while we all sat at the same table, we ate our meals separately. At the end of the meal, someone who I believe was a manager came to the table with the standard \"so how was everything?\" frankly, she should have known and come to the table with an apology. The bottom line for me: 1. When at Claim Jumper,  stick with ordering the salads, they do a good job with them in general. 2. Don't eat at the Green Valley Claim Jumper. Stick with town square and downtown. Those kitchens seem to work well. The Green Valley outlet, not so much.",

Appetizer platter was large and had a good variety. The baked potato entree was bland; the veggies were okay. Alfredo sauce didn't do anything for me. We also ordered chicken fried steak. It was two huge pieces, about 5\" or more in diameter, and from my sample, tasted pretty good. A lot better than my baked potato, that's for sure.  Desserts menu is decent sized, and even their \"mini\" desserts are enough for two people to share. The mini I-Declair was good, but not the greatest and I wouldn't order it again.  The only good thing about this place was the service. It was huge, no wait (due to there being lots of open tables on a Saturday night), and quick service. We didn't have to wait too long for our appetizer or food. Our waiter was entertaining and funny and should probably quit this job and be a waiter somewhere else.",

We ordered a white sangria, pretty tasty and very little alcohol -- just the way we like it. We also got a side salad that was fine, but not memorable. The shrimp fresca pasta was extremely buttery but not very salty, and the shrimp were overbreaded. The tenderloin tips were also OK with the beef being a bit chewy. We would probably go to Cheesecake Factory next time we're in the mood for big portions of classic American fare.",

    "text": "As a local Las Vegas resident, I have eaten at CJ several times before I started yelping and always had good experiences - especially during Happy Hour where they have one of the best and most expansive happy hour menus in town.  So a few days ago when a quick dinner decision was required for a party of 5 adults (3 visiting from other states with no CJ exposure) and a toddler, Claim Jumper was the answer.    We arrived at 5pm on a weekday and were able to sit in the Saloon and enjoy happy hour drink prices.    There was too much food ordered to review here - so I will stick to my general consensus of our group.  THE MEAL WAS GREAT, ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, and OVERALL WE HAD A GREAT TIME!     Some food tips here: 1.  Everyone who ordered shrimp dishes loved them!  The western BBQ shrimp wrapped in bacon was a HUGE HIT.  So much so, that my father-in-law from Ohio returned the NEXT DAY and ordered it again!!  For real!    2.  The chicken fried steak is not exactly what Southerners are used to.  It was decent, but not going to blow you away.  It's Las Vegas - skip the chicken fried steak here people!    3.  The potato cakes were the biggest hit.  Order them as a side dish.  You won't be disaapointed.    4.  The rotisserie chicken which they specialize in was just average.  My father-in-law is a rotisserie chicken man and he said \"I've had a better rotisserie at Costco than here.\"  Now, he still ate the whole chicken, so it must have been good enough for him.    5.  Hit up the Saloon during Happy Hour - they have over 15 food items to chose from on discount, and more than 15 drink specials.  It will save you lots of money!!",

Not too early to close  My main issue is that when the food runner brought our food out, he asked if we wanted anything else? I politely asked if I could have another order of their bread (I got chowder,so I wanted to dip the bread in it). Our server just checked on us riight after the runner gave us our food, so it didn't occur to me to ask her for bread again, seeing as I don't want them to bring 2 rolls out if they didn't need to.... we're Eating, time passed, no bread, couldn't see our server nearby so I just asked another one for bread.... she says okay.... and once again nothing. Our server never checked in again until we were already done. The chowder was meh anyway (you try coming from a coastal state and moving to NV), but that's not the point here. I was disappointed in the service.... the runner should have brought the bread out and the other server should've told our server that we were requesting something.   It was happy hour so I can't complain about the prices and my bf enjoyed his food. But we won't be returning.",

HMMMM!#@&* When I got to the restaurant I went to the counter to pay and let the person know I had a reward card with a reward on it as I just checked online at home. The manager told me that my reward was only good for a certain amount of days and that I could call the number on the card to get it taken care of...I said lets do it. He said they are closed now. I asked how we could work this out. He said if I could prove it, he would honor it, this was while he showed me a screen that clearly showed my reward put on and then taken off as I had missed it by a couple days. If I new the rewards expire quickly I would have used it sooner or not ordered at all to avoid confrontation at the restaurant. He looked at me as if I was trying to rob his restaurant. LOL....There are a lot of really nice places to choose from where they treat you right and the rewards can be used when you want. They would rather throw the food out than take care of a rewards customer. The reward was only a small balance and I would have paid cash for the rest. I would hate to see how they treat customers that are not rewards members....CRAZY!  Lesson...Don't get tricked into thinking that being a reward member matters!!",

I remember the roasted veggies were perfectly seasoned and had big brussel sprouts among other veggies. The lattice apple pie was big and had a sugar sprinkle top. This year I decided to order some sides to go with our Thanksgiving dinner and I am hugely disappointed. The food is completely different, this time there are no brussel sprouts in the roasted veggies. It is merely a mix of carrots, zucchini and onions. The apple pie is small and looks like it is grocery store quality. The macaroni and cheese is just plain noodles that you add cheese sauce on top of. Not like a gourmet Mac n cheese from a restaurant. It's comparable to boxed Mac n cheese. And the portions for the 6-8 people serving is more like for 3-4 people. They didn't even fill the baked beans half way up the container. I regret wasting my time driving all the way out to Henderson to pre-pay for the sides and then drive back out there to pick it up. I thought I would be getting the same quality of food we had from them 3 years ago.",

We were halfway through our entrees when our friend finally got her appetizer, and by the time we were finished our other friend finally got her entree. In return she got a complimentary cup of what tasted like, canned clam chowder.... yay.  I was surprised at the price of this place based on the quality of the food and service.   This place is so much nicer as an ambiance than it is of an actual establishment.   It's too bad that the server is super nice because his personality is much better suited at a better establishment.y",

It wasn't great, but because it has a variety of items it was a good middle ground for my husband and I who like very different foods.  This last time we went I was really disappointed in the food and is the reason why I will not be back.  I ordered a country fried steak and asparagus.  The steak was hard to cut because it was on the rubbery side.  The asparagus was so fat the base of each stalk was a good 3/4 inch-way too big! The waiter took so long coming back that we were done eating by the time he returned.  I showed him the asparagus and he offered to replace it.  I politely declined. We had our 1 year old son with us who was tired of waiting and fussy.  We left, and when I got to the car I looked at the receipt and realized the waiter hadn't even removed the upgrade charge for the asparagus!  The meal was overpriced for the quality and service we got.  Don't make my mistake, choose a higher class restaurant to celebrate your anniversary!",

Only a few tv's in there so place yourself accordingly if you want to watch a game.   Our waiter, William, was over in seconds to greet us.  He provided exemplary service the entire time.  Definitely knowledgeable of the menu with great suggestions.  I'll make sure to ask for his section next time! Thank you William!  We opted to split some pretzel sticks w/cheese.  Only $2 on the Happy Hour menu.  Love it!  But we can't just stop there.  We also split the Widow Maker Burger.  Phenomenal!  They cooked it perfectly as requested.  This sandwich is piled high with smoked bacon, onion rings, avocado, cheddar and tomato.  The burger was juicy and delicious. I would definitely get this again.  They have pretty good HH Menu options.  With happy hour times everyday and ALL day on Sunday, it's really convenient.  I would love to stop back in again soon!",

    "text": "We went Friday the 13th. Maybe that was the wrong idea...I am mainly giving it a 1 star due to the not-so-good service and the expense of the meal not being worth what we received. First off, we made reservations, and glad we did. We walked in and it the waiting area was about 15 people. We walked up, got brought right to our table. I'd have to imagine a lot of people made reservations, as there were a lot of empty seats. We sat down, my friend got the house merlot ($7) and I got a domestic beer ($5.25). We ordered the zucchini sticks. VERY good! a light breading, and ranch dressing. I would recommend these. You get a huge pile of them, so best if there are 3 of you to share since it is an appetizer. They also brought out a big loaf of warm cheddar bread. When salads came, we did not get any cracked pepper. The people behind us did get fresh cracked pepper.  My friend got the blackened bow tie chicken, I got the rack of baby back ribs. The blackened chicken was good, but not fantastic. You can get better pasta at a cheaper price at Pasta Cucina inside Sunset Station Casino.  As for my baby back ribs... I only got 7 bones. There are 13 ribs in pork, granted a couple of ribs may get left off on the shoulder. Basically you are NOT getting a rack. You are getting a half a rack, cut into two sections. I would guess they are taking a section of 3 or 4 that should have been on my plate, and putting it on someone's plate that ordered a half rack. And my \"supposed rack\" was $25.99!!! I was told gravy came with my mashed potatoes, it didn't. by the time it came, the mashed potatoes were cold. Now maybe this was a mistake. If it was, the manager can contact me here. I doubt that will happen as I am sure they give everyone a half rack when they order a rack.  Bottom line, we paid about $75 for a dinner that we felt cheated on and that the service left much to be desired. For that price you can go to Carve steakhouse inside Eastside Cannery and get great service, both get the Rib eye or prime rib (both are fantastic) and get out cheaper. But no drinks (hey, you are in a casino, gamble and drink for free).  Just too many good places to eat in vegas and not walk away feeling like you were cheated.",

I think I'm secretly in love with the chocolate mother lode cake and disguise it by saying how much I enjoy the restaurant and think their food is great, yada, yada, yada.    I was happy to see this location in NV and decided to get my favorite salad, the California Citrus Salad, to go.  It's a great combination of greens, avocados, mandarin oranges, green onions, golden raisins, cranberries and candied walnuts.  Soooooooooo good!    While waiting for our orders, my co-worker and I decided to get a brownie to split.  It was big, of course, so it was like having one whole \"normal\" brownie.  Sad to say, this was the first disappointing thing I've had.  It wasn't as moist inside as I expected, not as chewy on the outside as I would have liked, and I now realize I don't care for nuts with my brownies.   Oh well.  It was chocolate, so there was no way I wasn't going to finish it.  If you haven't been to CJ, you're in for a treat.  Just save room for the chocolate mother lode cake!",

They told me we would have to wait for 40 minutes, even though the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  (That's another sign.  Where is the business during Friday dinner).  They seated us early.  Didn't matter.  It took an hour to get the food.  I could hear the manager apologizing to another table next to us, so it must be common.    Not only that, people who showed up later got their food earlier.  And the food?  Nice and cold.  Boycott this place.  Maybe we can get a better restaurant to replace it.",

    "text": "Ok Claim Jumper is my new favorite restaurant!! They just comped our whole anniversary dinner (like $81 bucks) because we had a couple of issues. Tasha ordered a Hawaii Tai and it had a piece of Glass (we think it came from the rum bottle so they told us) in it (she did not cut herself). Then we thought ok free drinks, discount on food maybe? We weren't mad, we just didn't want anything else with ice in it. So they brought out this bomb red wine with a slightly obscene French name (menage a something)   Then when Tasha's Surf and Turf came out my mashed potatoes were ice cold because Tasha's meal took longer to cook. They apologized profusely, brought me new sides, a red velvet happy anniversary cupcakes, and a huge slice of six layer chocolate cake and extra garlic Texas cheese toast comped the whole meal gave Happy Anniversary wishes and begged us to come back again so they can make things perfect. Best service & recovery I have experienced in years (like 7). I was not expecting all of that!   All and all when they fixed our issues the food was amazing and the service and the recovery more than made up for our two, \"Uhhh what's this?\" moments. I will be back again. Thanks guys for making our 9 year anniversary memorable in an awesome way because this could have played out very, very differently. Not the perfect experience, but the absolute perfect effort.",

When we asked her/told that the price wasn't right, she stated \"Oh, I thought you ordered off the main menu\".  Hello people, we are sitting in the bar with the bar menu and bar prices.

Needless to say she hems and haws around and says that she has to check with her manager first before she can make the adjustment on our bill.

We started with an appetizer, lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was prepared well, very tasty and crispy. We were also served garlic cheese bread.  For our main course, I had ordered the country fried steak and a house salad. The steak was cooked well, but it had a bit too much breading on it. My fiance ordered the ribeye with a house salad- they were made very sloppy. Her ribeye was cooked as she ordered (medium rare). The food was all cooked very well, and I felt that it was totally worth the money.   My problem I had here was the atmosphere. The restaurant was full of people who lacked manners and courtesy. The waiting staff seemed very rushed and wanted to turn the tables as fast as possible. I have memories of this place being very classy, but it seems to have dropped it's standards. While the food was good, I much would have taken it all to go.",

Each location I've visited has offered clean facilities, consistent food, and good (but not excellent) service.  The wait staff seem to be stretched a bit thin even when the restaurant isn't all that busy.  So a leisurely meal goes by nicely but when in a rush, maybe pick a different restaurant.

This happens sometimes, so we weren't going to let this ruin our night.  Our server was OK but it was apparent that she was overwhelmed when the host slammed her section with at least 7 tables.   The happy hour prices are good but there were a lot of children seated in the bar area.  They should probably open up happy hour to the entire restaurant to avoid this uncomfortable issue.",

She mentioned that they serve large portions so we decided to split the Ore Cart. The bread they bring out was sooo good, but it stuck to my teeth a lot. Their chicken and tri tip was really good. The chicken was like almost a whole chicken which was pretty cool and definitely lives up to the large portion remark (the price matches the portions though, $30 for the ore cart). We had tried to get a side of veggies but they were super limited in their options which is why they lost a star. No broccoli?? That is a crime. And no green beans or zucchini. So we got mashed potatoes with country gravy and mac n cheese. The mashed potatoes were really good but the mac n cheese was very plain. The sauce didn't stick to the noodles well (too watery?) and I ended up eating dry noodles most of the time.  Definitely a good place to check out if you love meat!",

So the bartender took my drink order but then neglected me while making some drink she didn't know how to make for another customer. That took approximately a half hour before she took my order, plus she wasn't too friendly. I had ordered the New York Strip, baked potato, and asparagus. The asparagus was excellent but the potato lacked enough butter and sour cream. Now the steak in the other hand was cooked like I like it, medium rare, but lacked seasoning. I would definitely not go back there for a steak but I might try something else from their menu and probably sit in the dining room.",

There's almost always kids and small family groups enjoying the friendly service in the dining room so mom and dad will feel at home. Plenty of choice kids meals along with a side order menu that's a hit with the monsters. Add to this giant cake and huge desert selections and it's hard not to enjoy the sweets along with the kids. Prices are competitive but not cheap on the adult menu. But when you consider the whole benefits of stopping here for dinner it's in line with the service and atmosphere.  And there are many bargains too. The alternate barroom seating is very generous and spacious. The large screen tv is a plus but the REAL secret here are the prices. A special happy hour menu offers drinks and wine at about half price! A appetizer menu offers everything you can imagine from $3 to $9! So it's a great comfortable room to relax , enjoy the food AND save money. What's not to like? Go there. Go there now!",

    "text": "I can't say I didn't see it coming, but a recent dining experience on a Friday evening was pretty much ridiculous. My party of 2 wanted to dine al fresco, so we headed to the patio and were told a table was opening up. As we went to the table, another server told us that someone will get to you eventually, or something to that effect. It was packed on the patio, and we saw that the servers were rushing around.   O and MG, no one stopped by our table for about 20 minutes, so we gave up and went to sit at the bar. Things did improve after that, luckily! We got our drinks pretty quick and were finally able to order. We had 2 appetizers- the spinach/artichoke dip and breaded lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was delicious, and the dip not so much. It was not hot and needed more flavor. My meal of simply grilled mahi was pretty good, although the sauce could've been tastier. My dining partner really enjoyed the steak and shrimp entree. Our server/bartender was pretty good about checking on us and did mention something like they didn't expect such a crowd that night, which didn't make sense to me. I learned my lesson about trying to dine on the patio, for sure!",

I AM HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING TROPICAL. I told the server and he seemed like he didnt even care. We ran out of the restaurant to go to the doctors and I broke out in hives and had swollen lips, eyes, itchy throat and mouth and was such a mess I had to take off of work the next couple of days. I send a message to Corporate and they act like they dont care and BRIBE me with a $25 gift card to claim jumper if i sign a waiver stating I will not talk about this incident and any issues caused by it were not their fault and they are not responsible. They wanted all of that for a 25 dollar gift card and they were so sneaky about trying to get me to fill out what they say is an \"innocent paper\".

Given we had a group of 25, I had fairly low expectations for the service, but they did an excellent job! From the time we sat down to the time we left it was just over two hours, which I think is pretty decent with a group that size!   Now beware, the menu is huge. Pages on pages! I had my mind made up three different times and finally when put under some pressure, made a decision. I settled on the Frisco Burger and fries, a swiss cheese burger with thousand island dressing served on grilled parmesan sourdough (like toast, not a bun). It was tasty but nothing special. I actually wish it were served on a bun. If I were to describe my eating pace, I'd say its fairly normal (if I'm not lying, a little quicker than the average) and the bread quickly became soggy. The fries were also nothing special, thinly cut with a good crunch. Again, nothing wrong with the food but I could get a similar burger under ten bucks elsewhere.   Overall, everyone in the group seemed content and no problems arose, but I think this is a one and done experience for me.",

There were only 3 people in the restaurant which I found very odd for a weekend. I had heard several changes took place including smaller portions(which they are normally known for big portions) and price increase. Well both were True. An order of onion rings is now the price of an entree and the Southwest Egg Rolls I love very much compares in price to a steak I can get elsewhere. Last and final visit here.",

Service was slow & it seemed the bartenders do not like to make eye contact. Waited 10 minutes before getting my 1st beer. Some guy who looks like he might be the manager was behind the bar & he had the most miserable look on his face the whole time he was back there. He defiantly would not make eye contact. Not sure based on service if it's worth going back. I haven't been there in serveral years & I guess that's why.",

We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer which tasted great. Our main entrees, the Tri Tip Dip and country fried steak were also great and the temps were just right, not too hot or cold. For our first outing here, I don't think it could have gotten any better unless the food was free. Two thumbs up CJ, you did it right.",

Another time I went for lunch and felt jipped by the prices, but I guess that's because the happy hour deals were so good.    I do like the atmosphere of this restaurant - much nicer than an Applebees or Friday's but not \"stuffy\" or too fancy.  Just right for a casual lunch or meeting friends for an \"easy\" dinner and drinks night out.  The service has always been good here but still, I can't help but thinking that I'm never blown away by the food.    I think the thing that was most surprising was that they were getting cleaned up and ready to close at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  We had to move the gathering back to the house.   I think I'll keep this on my list of \"pretty darn good happy hours\".",

This visit was the day they gave vets free meals so my husband and I went because he is a Vet, we ended up waiting over an hour because the place was packed with people there to eat. When it was finally our time to sit and eat the waitress thank us for our patience which was nice. We ordered our food and they brought out this garlic cheese loaf that tasted amazing, the last time we were there they had the sun dried tomato one which is also very tasty. We waiting a lot longer than normal for our food but the nice waitress we had thanked us again for our patience and brought us out another loaf of bread to nibble on while we waited for our food. The have a clam chowder soup my husband gets and he says it's the best he has had. My husband got the talipia plate and he enjoyed his food he said it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My chopped steak was disappointing for the first time, it was way over cooked and was a little burnt on the bottom i ate it because i didn't want to have to wait for a new one and also i was appreciative of what they were doing for the vets. I will visit again becasue i think they were just having trouble keeping up due to the volume of people there. When we finished our meal the waitress brought us our bill for my food the drinks and my husbands soup and thanked him for his service which was very nice. The thing that always is the same when we dine here is the amazing customer svc and the quality of food minus mine for this meal.",

He ordered Chicken Fried Steak and mashed potatoes. I had the chopped steak and mashed potatoes with cheesy garlic bread. I had a glass of Apple Cider Beer to wash the food down. The Chicken Fried Steak seemed to have shrunk in size from what my husband remembers. His dinner salad had no taste, he said. I had the Caesar salad it wasn't bad. The chopped steak was good, the bread was good. My husband wasn't thrilled with his dinner. Too much batter not enough meat.  The waiter wasn't very attentive, though he did let me sample the cider before I ordered it. It just seemed the table next to us got more attention from their waitress. Like bringing the pepper mill for their salad and checking on them. Then we had a long wait on getting the bill. Maybe the Claim Jumper is passed it's time?",

And just so you know for further reference if a customer asks if a item contains onions it may be a big deal as in they are ALLERGIC! I sincerely did not want to come back to this establishment but was convinced by my significant other the service could not be as bad as our first visit. But low and behold it was worse!

The customer service here is okay nothing that really wows me. Sometimes you can get a great server that is on top of everything and then other times you can get one that forgets things or doesn't refill your drinks. There is usually never a wait time and if there is there is a very comfortable waiting area but, the most we've waited is 10 minutes even on the busiest of days like Valentine's day. I recommend this place to everyone who like a variety of dishes that are cooked and seasoned to perfection !",

    "text": "We stopped by Claim Jumper on a busy Tuesday evening in Green Valley to grab a bite to eat. The food was good, but the service was GREAT!  I cannot say enough things about our server. He was the epitome of a waiter, and I seriously left him a 50% tip. Friendly, efficient, helpful and just plain funny --- he really made our meal fun and was joking around with the kids the whole time.  As far as the food goes -- Claim Jumpers' bread is delicious and I feel like I've gained ten pounds just after having a few buttery slices. After loading up on bread, we couldn't finish our \"real meals.\" Lol..  My BBQ chicken sandwich was enormous (all of their meals are truly made for two here) and tasty. My younger daughter ordered a pizza which was reportedly good. My older daughter went with chicken fingers and basically none of us could finish anything we ordered. In a nutshell, we took most of our dinner home after gorging ourselves on bread.   However, the price is decent and the customer service was outstanding. Not to mention, we have tons of leftovers!",

First tip would be to call in to make a reservation if you are planning on having dinner any time between Friday and Sunday! They get pretty busy and you may be waiting 15 minutes to be seated. Other than that wait time, everything else goes by quick! The servers are attentive and cooks are fast! I absolutely love that their appetizers have two sizes! They come in the original big sharing size and a smaller snack size! I usually get the snack sizes because I like to order a few of them because I like trying different things! The calamari with peanut slaw is delicious and so is their pretzel with jalapeno cheddar dip! My husband loves getting their chicken pot pie and their jambalaya! If you're looking for a tasty side dish that is hard to find in town I highly recommend the creamy corn! I ordered the steak for my most recent visit and I hate to say I was a bit disappointed in the way it was cooked. I asked for medium expecting more pink and for it to be juicier but it was dry and definitely more of a medium-well than a medium... other than that the service is great and food is tasty!",

The restaurant was sold in February so they had plenty of time to notify the people who had previously arranged the function.

Food: Ordered the lemon pepper fried zucchini appetizer, which I have ordered many times before. I felt like they changed it up a bit though. It was still good, but not as I remembered. They have this delicious, warm cheesy bread that is complementary if you ask for it. Enough for 2-4 people. I was also lookin forward to their side salad which i remember being one of the best side salads I've had. But this was also a bit different. Feels like they changed the lettuce, which made it more like a typical side salad than a particularly amazing one. However their cornbread croutons and grated cheddar cheese on the salad still make it stand out a bit. Entrees were ribeye and bow tie blackened chicken pasta. Ribeye was good, with loaded mashed potatoes and roared Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were the best part of the whole mean in my opinion. Pasta was another dish I thought i remembered being different, better. But it was fine. It also had tortellini in it, which i quite enjoyed. For dessert, berry butter cake. Quite delicious actually. I recommend.  Service: Our server was lovely. She was attentive and sweet. Kind and came by to refill our beverages. Brought us the bread right away when we asked for it.   Vibe: There are a lot of choices at this establishment. Something for everyone I'd say. Traditional comfort food and no shortage of desserts. They've made some changes to the menu, but nothing that would turn me away.",

Warren was very courteous and helpful, especially when we had questions about the menu. Warren was also attentive and on his A-game from start to finish. My family loved his outgoing personality!  I ordered the Drunk Chicken (what a name) and it was actually better than I had expected. The chicken was extremely tender and still maintained its moisture, despite the fact that it's grilled chicken breast. The Bacon-Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce tasted mainly of bacon and was a bit too oily, but yummy nonetheless. Who doesn't love bacon? \"Potatocakes\" aka croquettes were nice and creamy... As if I needed more carb intake after that mouth-watering garlic cheese bread!  The portions at Claim Jumper are generous and very filling. We all went home with leftovers!

Wish the food was as exceptional cause I would give five stars for both, but rarely the case.  Our mini cheese HH pizza was dripping w/ a pool of grease & I can assure you that even for the $5 HH price, I would not eat it for free.  Hours later we still regretted even eating one slice.  Thankfully we didn't try the mini pepperoni cause I can't imagine the grease on it.      The only worthwhile item on the HH, as I've found out the hard way is the Wedge.  Very fresh & crisp Lettuce & I love balsamic & blue cheese mixed.  The bacon on it & red onion were in perfect portions & I asked for no tomato.    Excellent portion so just take off the Spinach & Artichoke, mini pizzas & add the calamari or something.  I am totally satisfied w/ five stars for the HH Wedge, but it's like hit or miss w/ the other items on HH.  I even got a free item for our bday month in June & was still left disappointed in their food.  You end up spending more on HH to get satisfied or have to complain.  I have eaten off of the regular menu & the best item is the calamari & dessert!  Next time, will have to try that again.  It's a large portion also.  Add the Wedge & I think it would be a perfect meal.  We will see next time.",

I highly recommend the shrimp fresco pasta, the south western egg roll appetizer, and the seafood platter (can't think of the name) with two kinds of fish and shrimp. My husband swears by their burgers!   Over all a great experience - they never disappoint!",

Another 10 to order appetizer. He waited for the appetizer to come out before taking our dinner order. My Mom's dinner came out first. About 5 minutes later my husband's came out. Then they brought out mine. I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo. What arrived was chicken pot pie.  Our waiter was MIA at this point. We never had our drinks refilled or asked if everything was ok.  Horrible experience.",

We chose to sit in a booth in the bar area as it looked so nice and open.   We had rotisserie chicken and baby back ribs and they were both really good. The starter salads were really good and really quick to come.   Service was great, food was great and we will definitely be back.",

I think only two servers, and couple food runners were working at that time. I wouldn't blame them it was dead in the restaurant area.   Anyway, we were able to order from the happy hour menu and got the calamari and the spinach artichoke dip.   They have awesome drink happy hour selection, but the food.... Save your money on more drinks and skip them.   Happy hour portions of appetizers are very small. The calamari doesn't even look like calamari. Lol. Spinach artichoke dip was pretty good, but you get a way bigger portion for around the same price at like YardHouse.  The service was awesome tho! Wish I can say that about the food too.",

Sure enough, our expectations were met. We started off with a creamy tortilla soup, fire roasted artichoke, and greens salad with in house made blue cheese dressing. All great, no complaints.  Our dishes included tri tip, chicken pot pie, chicken wings, and the small (but no so small) portion of the chicken fried steak. Again, everything was pretty awesome. I did not like the fact that the pot pie came with fruit. Those 2 things don't go together.  For dessert we had an apple crumble, an italian lemon cake, and a red velvet cupcake. Nothing stood out like OMG I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS. But was everything delish? Yep. Will I return for great food next time someone is in town? Yep.  Also, all that food, $102.  Truly not bad at all.  Service was also great, and our waiter mentioned he'd only been there for 4 days. I never would have know had he not told us. Looking forward to my next time here.",

Garlic/ cheese bread was out of this world. Our waiter was Eddie and he was \"spot on\"! Will definitely return. Thanks CJ!

    "text": "I used to love Claim Jumper and rarely ever got to go as a kid.  It was too far from home for a regular dinner outting.  Then I moved to Las Vegas and just sort of forgot about them.  Just the other night, though, my family visiting from California recommended we go.    It was a bit different than I remember.  The food is still, for the most part, enormous.  It is what they are known for.  My step mom ordered fried chicken.  It looked my like a turkey filling up the plate the way it did.  The only food of disappointing size on this occassion was the dinner salad we all ordered.  It was a bit skimpy and sort of soggy even though we all ordered different dressing.  I don't remember the bread with tomato dipping sauce being brought to the table before.  It was alright but sort of forgettable.  It was fluffy which was nice.  But the sauce on top and the sauce on the side were bland.  I had a piece with and a piece without the sauce and could hardly tell the difference.  I'll pass.  There were also some items I don't remember seeing on the menu previously.  And even a few I remember that I did not see anymore.  There was no salad bar and we were told it is because we are in Las Vegas and they cannot compete with the casino buffets when it comes to salad bars.  Interesting.  Service the other night was not bad.  Though it is worth noting my grandma ordered fish and chips with no chips but rather a side of fruit instead.  When her meal came, it had fries and no fruit.  We had to ask again for that.  My aunt had to ask for the sweet potato she ordered because it was not brought out either.  Everything else seemed to go off without a hitch.    I had a Widow Maker burger that was crazy good.  It was cooked to a perfect medium the way I like it.  It was topped with onion rings, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato and some sort of relish.  It was difficult to eat because of its size.  But it was also delicious.  I was impressed with that.  What I was disappointed in with my overall meal was my iced tea.  It was weak.  It was more like water with food coloring.  The lemon helped to give at least some contrast to an otherwise tasteless beverage.  I think I have pretty much fallen out of love with Claim Jumper.  It might as well be just another page in my high school year book that I look back on with fond memories.  I am moving on.",

I felt that we were forgotten about, when I finally received my Burger it had paper in it, apparently they did not take the paper off the cheese and I ate part of it.  The server told me it was ok because it was just paper, she grabbed a manager who told me the same thing.  I argued that it was not ok, no one should eat paper!    The manager told me she would replace it with soup or a salad, I told her forget it I was only on lunch and I would stop somewhere on the way back to work to get a burger at a fast food place, my friend said \"no they can just make you another one\"  and the manager just looked at us....she was not prepared I guess to give us another burger?!  Weird.....she disappeared for about 15 minutes, but we could see her walking around in the bar area, when she came back out she actually lied and said she cooked it herself....kind of difficult to make a burger in the kitchen when you are in the bar!",

    "text": "This was the first time I've been to this restaurant. I went here on August 18th, 2019 around 6 Pm. When we walked in, it was kind of busy. We were told by the seat-placer that we would have to wait 10 minutes to sit at a table. Which isn't bad, we ended up sitting at a booth anyways (it was the last available too!). (skip to the end if you want a pro and con list. I'm going to go in depth)  Customer Service 5/5: We realized that it was kind of busy, but our server was doing our best. They were quick and fast, and were very kind. Which means a lot to me because I do have social anxiety and I'm very self-judgmental because of the way I talk and speak (I take too long & stutter). But my server was just very nice and understanding. When I would ask questions about the menu, they were very patient with me and I genuinely appreciate that. Our food was brought hot and ready and at a reasonable time. Just overall kind and very patient with us. Not to mention, our server helped us get a good price on our food with the Happy hour menu! So cool!  Food 4.8/5: When I go to a restaurant, I usually order something simple the first visit to see if the food in the restaurant is in my style. I ordered Buffalo Spicy chickenwings with fries. They arrived around 15-20 minutes after ordering (Which is actually a good & reasonable timing, considering that the restaurant was clearly busy and was slowly goin down a bit). My food was hot & ready and especially delicious. The food didn't feel rushed, the food didn't feel like it lacked negligence. The food was great and perfect. I also ordered the Brownie Finale. It took around 10 minutes to get it. It was better than I imagined! The brownie was fresh and warm. It kind of exploded with gushy warmness inside. I don't really like desert or many sweet stuff in general, but that brownie + vanilla ice cream was really enjoyable. I'm glad I got it, no regrets at all. The only thing I didn't like was that supposedly the Dr. Pepper was in the same container where the Root beer was previously in. I was told beforehand, so I give the restaurant props for that. I just wish Dr. Pepper had its slot that wasn't previously in Root Beer,   Atmosphere (no rating, cause its all personal):  I don't really like cold atmospheres. I wore a dress and some sandals. I'm a very naturally cold personal in general (due to conditions), so I was very unprepared when I walked into the restaurant and it was very chilly. But to think of a perspective of a Vegas local that isn't always cold (like me), I think it would be a great place to go to escape from the Vegas heat. So there's that. The style is also slightly kind of rustic I realized. It isn't really my style, but its a restaurant, not an outfit. :) . Its also a calm and peaceful atmosphere. The lights were dimmed and it was quiet in the end, which would be great for someone who has special needs (keep in mind, I was there from 6 pm - 8 pm)  Pros: -Good service from servers (MAKE SURE YOU TIP :) ) -Food is treated with love and care (Regardless if the restaurant is busy or not) -Good place to chill (Literally, get away from the Vegas heat!) -Calm atmosphere (good for special needs)  Cons: - Dr Pepper was in the same slot where root beer was in (I was told beforehand, so its kind of okay)  Things To Consider: -If you are a naturally cold person, definitely bring a jacket just in case! A normal or light jacket -You might need to ask what type of drinks they have or what are the sizes of some things--considering that they're not on the menu -Buy smartly using the Happy Hour Menu. You can get more (or equal) for less!",

We would have asked them to make it right but it was right enough so we let it go.    Here's what went really wrong, like two stars wrong.  I normally try to fix stuff instead of a negative review.  But there was no fixing this...  Read on.    I had the rib eye. I know what a rib eye looks like.  It's a pretty distinctive pear shape with an eye section and a main section. The steak I got was a rectangle with no eye. I asked the waitress when she dropped it off and she agreed that it didn't look right but she checked with the chef and was told it was a rib eye...  Then she took it back so chef could double check, and chef confirmed it was a rib eye. Then the waitress asked the manager to come by. He looked at it and said, \"it came out of the rib eye box...\"  At that point, I decided to eat my (probably NY strip) and decline his offer to let them make me another steak. If I was dealing with people who make their living in food, and didn't know a rib eye, it seemed like I should be happy with what I was provided. It tasted good. But it sure wasn't a rib eye. And $28 for a strip (I think they are $21 on the menu) seemed steep.   Whatever. I didn't want to ruin our celebration by having a frustrating exchange. I thought I could suck it up and let it go. I'm a nurse, not a chef, and if a chef and a manager both thought my NY steak was a rib eye, I wasn't going to fix them. I work hard in my real world fixing people and sure didn't want to fight the good fight on my day off. The meal was otherwise ok. We had fun and felt like we'd celebrated. We will just celebrate elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "It's been awhile visiting claim jumpers since Tukwila WA. Tried the country fried steak with mash and the salmon with coconut prawns. The decor of the place is rustic and the AC was flowing nicely. The server was polite and nice.  The white gravy on the country fried steak was too dense, like it was sitting out for awhile and salty. The mash was good but the gravy was once again too thick and salty for the mashed potatoes.  The salmon with the spicy sauce was good. The coconut prawns missed the mark because they were soggy. Really!?  They should have been nice and crispy like they serve at the Outback! 30 bucks for that dish and it was a fail. Don't think I'll return and leave it as a past memory.",

Since that has closed down, our nearest option is this one on Green Valley.  The quality of the food has significantly gone downhill... We were so disappointed...  The comparison is from the last time we ate at the town square location:  The ribs were dry.. the baked potato seemed like it was a day old ....  My fish taco had tiny pieces of fish and the taco was filled with red cabbage to make it look full The chicken dish, I think it was called Prospector something was salty... But not the entire dish... It was weird...  The experience was simply disappointing for us.",

They have a lunch menu with many different options to choose from, and it's organized by price. The prices were reduced from general menu pricing; however adding on a salad would cost extra on the lunch menu.  Our server was great and brought out one of the desserts with a candle in it for my brother. There are many different dessert options to choose from and our server made sure we got the best ones. (I would highly suggest both the brownie and cookie finales ... just saying!)   Overall the experience was a good one and the staff was lovely.",

    "text": "Never gave Claim Jumper Restaurants a chance. But when I realized they actually have a great happy hour best believe we went it to check it out!  It was around dinner time and was pretty busy in the bar area as well. At first we started out at a bar table top. Took awhile to get drinks there but wasn't it a huge rush so no biggie and he was pretty busy. Had a couple beers there and the pretzel app which was really good. On my last beer at the top it took a long time to come out so my partner moved to the bar itself and I waited at the top to close out there and for my beer but he was taking forever to check on us/bring my beer so I moved to the bar too. The bartender was like I'll just get your beer that'll be easier.. I just wanted to make sure we were able to close out there too and everything.. but seemed like it wasn't a big deal because we were next to the original area. Everything got settled and we were able to order through the bartender.   Had a couple more beers that were on happy hour at the bar then ordered some food to go. Gf ordered the club and instead of fries a salad, she ended up getting both by mistake of the kitchen which was cool. I ordered the veggie works personal pizza, which was suppose to be happy hour pricing I thought but got charged regular price. No biggie since gf got the hook up for fries so we didn't say anything.  We will be back!",

I ordered the Rib Eye, cooked medium rare with my two sides being rice pilaf and roasted veggies. For my started I had baked potato cream soup. Half way through dinner I started feeling nauseous and slowly lost my appetite. I had at least half of my steak, but then felt like I hit a wall and was done.  Don't get me wrong, the steak was perfectly cooked, but it seemed like everything I ate was super salty!   It wasn't until the next morning I felt really sick. I'm not talking 'bout hangover sick (because I didn't have any alchie bevies at dinner) but this was a different kinda sick that I wasn't familiar with before. Needless to say, I spent all yesterday morning with the porcelain king, and the only thing I can think of I got sick from the dinner from Claim Jumper.   Just be careful eating here.",

My husband ordered a chicken pot pie and he said it would be one of the best ones he has eaten at a restaurant.  I ordered the Cobb salad and replaced my turkey for the grilled shrimp. I also removed off the avocados and cheese. I had my blu cheese dressing on the side. The salad was huge and plenty if you wanted to split with someone else.",

We started with water as it's 113 and humid outside. For our lunch we had the Chopped Cobb salad 4/5 which comes with grilled chicken, crumbles of bleu cheese, plenty of avocado, bacon, diced egg and tomatoes topped off with bleu cheese dressing. And the black tie chicken pasta 4/5. The pasta is one of my favorites and is served with blackened chicken, bow tie pasta, spinach tortelloni stuffed with cheese and diced tomato all tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce yum yum! Very filling but good to the last bow tie pasta!  They also brought out some toasted cheese topped bread, which accompanied the meal well.   We thought we were ready to ask for the check then realized...we couldn't possibly leave without splitting a slice of carrot cake! The carrot cake was huge and topped with crunchy shreds of carrot which gave it a nice texture 5/5. This is why we keep coming back for more! Additionally, for your birthday they bring you out either a red velvet cupcake or a small cake and ice cream topped with sprinkles.  Keep in mind hey offer a 15% Military discount for all you veterans out there! Enjoy the pics and add this to your annual rotation!",

    "text": "Tonight, my son & I went to the Henderson Claim Jumper to eat because I have the Landry card & was using my $25 birthday reward. The whole experience was the worst & we got the worst server ever...his name was Israel!! We got there @ 6:30 pm tonight & ordered @ 7:40.  We ordered 1  20 oz medium rare porterhouse steak that we were going to split, cause I don't eat a lot. You also get a choice of 2 sides, & we chose mashed potatoes & Brussel sprouts, but when we saw these big loaded baked potatoes being served to another table , i looked at my son & said those look so good, do you want to get that instead of mashed & he said yes, so I'm looking for my server to change our order. When I do find him, I let him know what we want to change & asked for more bread & told him to bring butter with it as they don't serve it with their bread. We must have sat there waiting for that bread 10-15 min with my sons water glass empty ! He finally brings us more bread , but he forgets the butter, & no water pitcher was in his hands, so I remind him that we asked for butter & we need our waters refilled , so he came right back with the things we requested & all is good! Now it's 7:15, & we're still waiting on that 1 medium rare steak & cant figure out what's taking so long! I look around again for my server cause I wanted to ask what's taking so long, & as he passes by our table, he tells me your steak is on its way out...their just changing out the mashed for the loaded Baker & I say ok. 5 min later our steak is served!  The food was delicious & cooked just right,  but was turned off that our server hadn't cleared all the bread plates w knives that we were thru with &  had stacked at the end of the table making it easy for him to grab as he was walking by, but nope , he left them there till the end !  My server only had 2 other tables ...a 4 top, & a 2 top, other than that , the restaurant was dead, so I figured we would get great service ! Boy was I wrong.... He takes our order at 6:40 ...we get our food by 7:15-20. We eat , & we're done , & the server brings a desert menu out to us asking if we saved room desert, but we were too full! Did he forget already that I was there to use my $25 birthday reward? Guess he did, cause no birthday cake w a candle ever made it to our table & I remembered when we got home that he never offered nor brought anything to the table acknowledging my birthday! Then the cake topper was....he brings me the check which was $10 higher than the $33 steak we ordered so I tell the server why is it $10 higher & I ask him  WTH did you do on this check? I said what's the 10% discount & where's the $25 you took off ? He said, oh , I'm sorry, I thought you were here to get your 10% discount... & again, did he forget that that was the 1st thing I said to him, that we were here for my birthday reward?? So he takes the check back to fix it & take the $25 off, & I also notice he charged me $1.50 twice & I ask what r those charges for & he said up charge on the loaded potato & the Brussel sprouts & I said where did it say theirs an upcharge for that? I asked to see a menu & he was right, but how misleading! It was hard to see & it mixed right in with all the other words, but I had pointed to the menu & asked him \"we pick 2 of these sides\" & he says yes . He said nothing about the 2 choices that I made would have a separate up charge cause I wouldn't have ordered them! So basically I got a steak ala cart for $33 cause I paid for my 2 sides...:TOTAL RIP OFF!! The whole experience sucked & I will NEVER GO BACK! So in turn, I stiffed  him & wrote on my charge slip that the service sucked & all the upcharges was the money I was going to tip you with! I didn't care, cause I'm never going back! So he can take my birthday cake & shove it up his ass! Thanks for the  poor service Israel!!!! Next time, why don't you warn the customer that there's an upcharge on those sides !  **ALSO, I MUST WARN EVERYONE...YOUR LANDRY CARDS ARE NO GOOD THERE ANYMORE, CAUSE I WAS TOLD THE  RESTAURANT HAS BEEN SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE & IS NO LONGER A LANDRYS RESTAURANT! JUST AN FYI....",

    "text": "Claim Jumper has become my go-to happy hour place.  Seating in the bar is usually not a problem.  The food deals are a steal.    Some of my favorite happy hour food items: the small salads, loaded skins, street tacos, calamari, and spinach artichoke dip.  I wish the fries with the gravy sauce was still on there.    I can't leave Claim Jumper without the butter cake dessert.  Even if I can only fit two bits, I will just take the rest home and have an amazing breakfast.  I keep meaning to try the new salted caramel butter cake, but then I forget when I am there!  Service is acceptable.  My girls and I have had days where we were slightly ignored due to how busy the establishment is.  I get it.  Most times I see it going that way, I make sure to grab the server and get the second drink ordered before I run out of the first one.    Speaking of drinks, you can never go wrong with a glass of wine.  However, if you are so inclined, the lemon drop martini and raspberry martini are excellent.  I also like their mojito.    Of course, the full menu is available in the bar area.  Claim Jumper has some solid fish and comfort food entries.    I'll be back!",

    "text": "Here's the deal: I have not been a big fan of this restaurant for a long time. Primarily because it just never struck me as something special and it really isn't. I always remember the food as being just a shrug. Nothing bad, but nothing great either. However, I have been visiting their restaurants lately per request of family and these recent experiences have changed my view of this brand and their food.  The last time I dined here, I decided to take a different route and go with a steak. I ordered their Ribeye Steak: hand-cut, boneless USDA Choice, 12oz  ($24.29) with Salt & Pepper Shoestring Fries. To my surprise, the meat was delicious. Tender, grilled perfectly to medium rare, and most importantly, tasty. I was floored. I have spent more money on less steak to have it cooked improperly! I was ecstatic. The fries were unbelievably salty though. It was okay though because I was just so happy about my steak. I also tried some of my fiance's Chicken Pot Pie ($13.29) and I couldn't believe it was better than the one I had at Grand Lux Cafe in September!  We also visited this past Thanksgiving with my fiance's parents. I selected the roasted turkey with gravy, stuffing, cranberry relish, baked potato with butter and chives, and roasted vegetables. Again, delicious! The turkey was surprisingly moist, gravy was tasty, the stuffing was also moist, the relish was sweet and added texture to compliment everything else really well, and the carrots, zucchini, red onions, and yellow squash were roasted perfectly! It was truly a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and very, very filling. The apple pie and pumpkin pie offered with the dinner were just okay. Oh, we were also served gigantic dinner rolls were so delicious.  Although Claim Jumper won't be one of my first choices for dining out, I can say that I am truly pleased with the food and wouldn't mind returning. I had a hard time deciding on 3 or 4 stars since the food has definitely been a four-star experience, however, the service and over dining experience would warrant three stars (our server couldn't remember anything - our orders, that there was a child in our party, if we paid our bill, etc - it was odd).",

We waited an hour after we were seated before anyone took our FOOD order. It was 9:42pm (one hour 42 mins after we arrived) before I got my food. At this point I wasn't hungry anymore so I asked for a to-go box and the check...I didn't get that until 10:20pm....that's just me! That's not the other people at my table. One ordered fries and got mash potatoes, another ordered tortilla soup and got clam chowder, one asked for ranch and got blue cheese. my brother got so tired of waiting he ordered his dessert the same time as his food and asked for it right away. He ate his food, asked the cake again and waited an additional 20 mins for a cake they said was ready. Before anyone asked it wasn't busy nor where they under staffed. Unacceptable! Our party of 14 won't be returning!",

Outstanding, that if I owned a fine dining restaurant I'd hire him in a heartbeat after a service like that. Claim Jumpers, I have to say you are lucky to have him a part of your team. He is honestly a great asset to your company. Treat him good and give him a raise! I really hope Edward reads this.

He kept making excuses and kept saying other tables were keeping him busy. We had to wait like 15 minutes from the time we first sat down until he even greeted us. Never refilled things quality checked things. He also refilled our waters with a sprite water mixture. Yes the manager we brought this to the attention of was great she gave us a free chocolate piece of cake to go. But still more should of been done. So much for having a nice birthday dinner. It literally did not live up to the standards I know Landry restaurants has. I am a Laundry card holder and have been to many of their restaurants but this was beyond terrible.",

If you're a fan of huge portions and a very broad menu, Claim Jumpers will not disappoint. The staff is very friendly and the food I've ordered has never been anything less than amazing. The prices are a little steep, so don't go in expecting neighborhood diner prices. But you get what you pay for and that's excellent food. Certain I'll be back a few more times in the near future. The places is overall clean and presentable so I give kudos to management and staff. Great job and keep up the good work. This visit was for my Mom's 80th birthday pre-celebration and they gave her a free piece of red velvet cake with a candle. They didn't light the candle however (weird) but that's ok. :)",

    "text": "The wait was 15 minutes long..... we waited with no problem.  We were seated and later greeted by our waitress.  I asked for water with lemon, and a spicy cilantro margarita. My guy ordered a Stella.  Our drinks took at least ten minutes to come.  The margarita was awesome.... Worth the wait. Possibly the best margarita that I have ever had. However, the Stella was lacking a little...and not as cold as it should have been.  One thing that really WOW'd me, was that they have a \"baby\" plate.  That I had never seen before, or heard of at any other restaurant.  And it's complimentary!   It comes to the table, covered in saran wrap,  with a stick of cheddar cheese, a slice of turkey, apple sauce, and mini orange slices.   Gourmet, no. But very thoughtful. It kept her busy.  We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza as an appetizer, along with the shrimp with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and slathered in BBQ sauce.  The pizza comes out, and it is the wrong size. That gets sent back. The shrimp were quite good. I would have liked more cream cheese, and they could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce.   My water was almost gone... Our waitress walked by us at least four times, and didn't refill it.  oh, and did I mention that I was the only one at the table that got water.......?   When customers are drinking, aren't you suppose to supply water..? Or do these people not watch Bar Rescue.?  One water between the two of us was kind of lame. Between our waitress and the supervisor, they both said that they were \"getting our drinks\" 3 different times...   Geez. THANK GOD IS WASN'T SUMMER.  We both ordered another round. My margarita was again, awesome. However, the Stella this time was flat and gross.. The supervisor took it away.  The right size pizza comes out, and we munch on that. It was good, like better than Metro Pizza good. Happy with that.   Still waiting for water refills.  I ordered the Frisco burger, on grilled sourdough, with thousand island and fires. My guy ordered the beef ribs with fried Mac and cheese.  When our food finally arrives, I take a bite. Salty. I take a drink of my water (waiting for ice cubes to melt, at this point). I take a second bite to make sure that I'm not too loopy.... Still salty. I pass it off to my guy (who loves salt) to try it. He thinks it's salty too.   UGH. The fries were good though. Best fries ever. A bite is taken out of the fried mac and cheese, and it's not hot.  I finally am able to flag down our waitress, and we let her know about the unsatisfying food. We take dessert (red velvet cupcakes) to go.  This was probably the longest dinner experience I have ever had in my life.  The check comes, and even with my over salty burger and the flat, warm beer taken off, our bill is $93.   Yes, $93. My guy thought I was joking.  Red velvet cupcakes are Ok. Nothing Bundt Cakes has waayy better Red Velvet.  Stick to just drinks and appetizers here. Nothing else is worth it.",

The service here was actually very good our server and busboy were very attentive and friendly. We usually avoid appetizers because we always leave so full and that was definitely the case here that night. Our entrees came with choice of soup or salad. I chose chicken tortilla and the babe had clam chowder. The winner was the chowder. Very good. Mine was good too but not equally delicious. The babe had beef ribs and I had beef tips with mushrooms atop mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Can't remember the name of the dish. The beef ribs were huge. They could have been more tender but we really enjoyed them. I wasn't a fan of my dish too much because it had so much Rosemary in the sauce but the beef was very tender and the veggies were really good. The service was great and I liked the log cabin decor inside. Made it very cozy. I would definitely come back when in the mood for comfort food the ambiance is nice and the service even better.

Location: It's location is very convenient. right off of the 215 and Green Valley pkwy. Parking is never a problem.  Ambiance: The restaurant looks like a log cabin. They have a fire place in the waiting area with comfy seating. The restaurant is family friendly with large booths.    Service: They do an excellent job as far as service. Everyone is friendly, professional, and move quickly. They defiantly know how to deal with volume since they are a fairly large restaurant.  Food: I like the kids menu for my boys. They have a good selection along with sides and desserts. Plus the portion is big enough for an adult. I've tried there french onion soup, new England clam chowder, tri tip dips, club sandwich, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken pasta, California citrus salad, BBQ salad, Chinese chicken salad, and many more. Every time I've been pleased. Portions are huge!",

Most of the portions are good enough for two or more.  Even though my friends and I were not too hungry, the appetizer, soup, and sliders were enough to put us pass satisfied. The calamari ($11.99) were cut from some monster squid that always makes me think of eating rubber bands. The French Onion soup survived the down scale in size that some other dishes did not. The sliders came in an order of four with a pile of shoestring fries. Another friend had joined later on. He ordered the chicken tortilla soup and a chicken bow tie pasta. With an alcoholic drink, the total bill came to less than fifty before tip. I always enjoy the French onion, but otherwise it was a mediocre meal. If you have many people who cannot agree, this would be a safe option to satisfy the masses.",

My mom recently  reviewed the menu online and convinced me to go for dinner at the Green Valley location. We were met with a lengthy wait for a table, but stuck it out. Only to be ignored at our table for ten minutes before a drink order was taken. We should have left, but we had invested so much time already. The online menu wasn't current and the entree she wanted wasn't available. A similar item was $3 more. Totally parched we finally received our drinks. The diet was flat. The iced tea was served with a rotting lemon. Then, later her entree, came with a rotten potato. They switched it out, but obviously rotten food shouldn't be prepared, let alone leave the kitchen. Cheese, bacon and butter was requested with the potato, and the cheese was some sort of liquid. Ew. The rest of our meal was edible, but underwhelming and overpriced. Plus, we left with upset stomachs.",

There is nothing phenomenal about the restaurant, but it is still good food...although a but pricey for some items ...$4.99 for a cup of soup is a bit steep for the portion size.  We tend to eat in the bar where it's a bit more relaxed.  Just avoid the bar on Friday nights as the Zappos crowd is a bit loud. They are not obnoxious...just loud...and it slows down service a bit.   Menu favorites: all of the salads, potato cheese soup, pretzel sticks, gigantic club sandwich, chicken/mashed potato/cinnamon apple dish (PLEASE BRING BACK THIS DISH WITH PORK!!!)",

I think the presentation was the most disappointing.  We ordered the app of shrimp ceviche and chips. Everything was just thrown on the plate - it was so messy.  They no longer have the turkey dinner so I opted for the tri tip. It was a bit dry and the muffin was way too sweet (sugar coated....ugh overkill...lose the sugar).  Kids pizza was decent sized but that was it....prices are high, a little too high for the food that was served.  I think the Towne Center location is Prob a little better than this one. Maybe one benefit is this is not as crowded....but that's it.",

Their food is heavily laden with salt so beware those watching their sodium intake. I can't say I enjoyed my food but, my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. He liked the steak that he ordered and said it was the best he ever had. I had a piece and can attest that it was very nicely marinated. My food; however, was salty to the point where I couldn't eat it. The BBQ shrimp were good but, I was hoping for something lighter on the salt after that appetizer and did not get that in the entree. They tried very hard to accommodate my tastes and brought a salad without anything salty which I enjoyed. Maybe next time they won't put as much salt. I would come back based on service. It speaks volumes when they go to the lengths they did to service me.",

Order the all you can eat salad and soup, my entree was the chicken pot pie finishing with mother lode cake,, The salad bar is fairly large with all the fixings usually associated with a salad bar... They have a baked potato section as well and 2 soup options...  I thought the veggies were fresh, the salads were fresh, and the dressings were really good.  The chicken pot pie is one of my faves at this joint, this time as with others, it was good..  The mother lode cake,, huge chocolate cake with 7 layers.  It takes me several sittings to finish it...  They have a fresh bakery onsite that bakes their breads and rolls you know its fresh.  I have tried the ore cart, and the ribs... Both selections are really good and big portioins...  In my opinion, this plays gets it right... They serve good tasting food, the portions are way big, service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get...  I whole heartedly recommend this location to yelpers.... I like this place and i hope you all do as well... Hope this yelps",

Lace got the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and loved it.  The service was decent. The host mumbled us to our seat, and the waitress was nice but pretty quiet and was not around much.

The manager then stated she would get fresh ones out right away.  When we asked for the check we asked if they are taking the skins off for us and the new bartender said \"I'll get the manager to come talk to you about this.\"  As a manager myself that is the worst thing a guest can hear.  After having to send our food back twice I think the last thing they can do is remove the charge for this item.

Our first plate everything was cold, we told the waitress.  She took them and brought back (she said new plates), they were are same plates with the bites still shown on the food and barely warm.  The manager came, he took our plates and brought new ones, they were cold.  We asked for boxes, because we were done.  The manager was not nice or apologetic.  We are ok with spending thanksgiving in Utah, since this was a horrible experience!!!",

I would have normally given them 4 stars but it is obvious they are making a valiant effort to rekindle their ratings.  In the past the service has been hit and miss never knowing what mood you will get with the server. The servers have often been moody rude or not good. This last visit the server was on task and the manager watched over with a visit and they also added hot bread for free this is fairly new. I would love to see them add more vegan slash healthier choices to the menu but I will continue to be a regular. We usually do fried zucchini sub marinara. Widow maker at happy hour sub veg patty and minus bacon and cheese. Ask for the California citrus salad with all spinach yum.",

That was 2 days ago and I won't go into details but I've had gastrointestinal issues since then.  Am I saying they did something to my food? I really can't because I have no proof, but I'll tell you this. I will never go back. And that's a shame because they have ruined a childhood memory for me.

The servers were in such a rush to get us in and out. We had just sat down and started looking at the menus and the server came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers. We weren't quite sure since we had just sat down and he said OK, NO APPETIZERS and walked away. He came back a few minutes later to take our drink orders and we were able to give him our appetizer order. Surprisingly, we had time to eat our appetizers before they brought our entrees. We weren't even done with our food and they were already bringing us TO GO boxes and the check. They didn't waste any time with that process. Our food was great as always. I ordered the Tri Tip Dip w/ Sweet BBQ Sauce. It was enormous. I could have used a second roll. My only negative comment is this... The serving dish was the problem. The sandwich roll was very soggy and they put paper on the dish so when I went to pick up my sandwich, the paper came up with it. It was hard to distinguish between it and the soggy sandwich roll. Overall, the food was very good. The just need to slow down the pace a little. When I go out for a meal, I want to be able to enjoy myself, not be herded in and out. If the restaurant is busy, I can understand the rush, but Tuesday night was not busy.",

We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks and some chips and salsa. We asked the bartender if any employees from the Summerlin location had come over to their location, specifically a bartender / server named Fernando. He said he didn't know, but that he knew a lot of Fernando's that worked in the back, to which he laughed. I thought that comment was very inappropriate.  He later asked us if we wanted another round and more chips and we said yes. An assistant manager delivered the chips. I asked if we could have more salsa too. She looked at me with a completely disgusted look on her face and said, \" you want more salsa now too\". At that moment I was completely stunned how she treated us that I wasn't even able to comment on that. Another manager walked by and I pulled her to the side and told her how she treated us. She was very apologetic. Then the woman came back with the salsa and needless to say I gave her an earful. I told her we didn't want the salsa, I canceled our second round of drinks, and we left. In my opinion they closed the wrong location, everybody at the Summerlin location was friendly and would go out of their way to make your experience a happy one. If I could give zero Stars I would.",

Yesterday we decided to give them another try so we arrive at the hostess booth. She tells us there will be a 20 minute wait. I don't mind waiting if the place is busy but you can clearly see from the entrance that there is almost nobody in there and plenty of empty tables. So I inquired and was told by the hostess that they do not have enough servers.  I don't think that I should spent my evening waiting for a table because management does not know how to schedule, so we left. This was the final straw for me and we will avoid this Claim Jumper location entirely from here on out.",

    "text": "Hi again folks! so it has been quite some time since I have been to Claim Jumpers. Me and the lady took my son out for late lunch. I was happy to see that a vegetarian section was on the menu. Very many vegan choices but was happy anyways for the effort. The place is still decorated with that country and snow Lodge feel. The people are nice and our server was nice. Probably could have been a little more friendly but they were nice. I ordered the lemon pepper fried zucchini sticks and a side of fries. My wifey ordered the pork sliders with fries. My son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. While we were waiting they got our drinks and delivered a cheesy bread which I couldn't have but both my son and wife said it was really good. I didn't see much of my server but my drinks stayed filled and the manager walk by one time and said hi. Now let's get to the food. Portion size is still large which is a plus. Like I've said before leftovers are always great. Each meal looks very appetizing and the food was tasty. My wife and son both agreed and the atmosphere was nice as well we sat outside in the patio. good job Claim Jumper! Keep it up it seems to be working! If I could add anything it would be more vegan options. Now I don't want to take away from this place as it is a meat-and-potatoes kind of establishment. But maybe a couple vegan options wouldn't be bad. Thanks again for a good time!",

I usually do take out but today for easter me and my family wanted to dine in.  I ordered what I usually ordered the classic, \"Roasted Tri tip\". The sides I picked was the roasted veggies, mash potato and caesar's salad. First that came was the salad and it looked so bad. i counted less than 20 cabbage and 2 croutons with barely any dressing. It was so shitty. I had to order the croutons and the dressing which i didn't have to do before. Next was the main dish. The tri tips. I liked my meat medium rare but this dish was hard and the slices are paper thin. My mother ordered the same exact order except she chose chowder soup instead of the salad and rice instead of the mash. Her soup was way over cook plus the rice looked like the rice you had for leftovers and was stuck in a fridge and heated in a microwave. This use to be my most favorite steakhouse. Unfortunately today the quality went super low. Very very disappointed.",

She had a unique name which I wish I remembered... 5 stars for her. I got a chicken quesadilla and a glass of the house Chardonnay. The quesadilla came out quickly which was awesome but the taste was below average. My bill for the quesadilla and Chardonnay ended up being $20. I think for $20 I can go elsewhere and get a more satisfying dish and drink.   If I come back, I'd like to come back for happy hour where drinks and food are most likely cheaper. I'd also try a different item on their menu.",

It took a little over an hour for our food to arrive, and 2 of the 7 dishes were ice cold. The cashier did remove the items from our bill, which was nice. I don't want to be completely negative, so I will say I ordered the mini chicken artichoke pizza which was extremely tasty. Claim Jumper is fine.. chain food, huge portions.

I love cooking Thanksgiving dinner, but since it's only me and my fiance, he has requested that I quit utterly destroying the kitchen with my turkey-cooking antics.  The last two years, we have ordered Thanksgiving meals from Claim Jumper instead.  Boy, am I glad... fewer dishes that way!  I'll let you in on a little secret too... their kid-sized Thanksgiving dinners are MASSIVE.  So big, in fact, that you can order them and still have leftovers for the next day.  And they are only $10.  For poor kids like us, that's a steal.  We always order ahead of time and pick up our plates.  The first year, we tried to dine in.  Never again.  Two-hour wait times are no joke.  Other than Thanksgiving, I cannot think of a plausible reason to eat at Claim Jumper.  Sure, I have eaten here for a regular meal before... it just wasn't anything to write home about.  And the portions are so darn big that it's almost sickening staring at the plate.  It's truly horrific that they offer things that are so high in calories.  If I'm gonna put myself into a food coma from eating something that massive, it had better be worth it... Claim Jumper isn't.  All four stars are for Thanksgiving dinner, which is always delicious.  If I were rating this on a normal day, it would MAYBE get two stars.  But Yelping about the holiday season (especially in April) makes me feel generous, so four stars it is.  Happy holidays, Claim Jumper.  Don't say I never gave you anything.",

We had a variety of ages: children, young adult middle age and the older folks. The seating arrangement for the kids was superb. There was lots of space for socialization. The placement for the  birthday celebrant was lovely and perfect.   Michael the manager gave us the best, cordial and service oriented crew. There wasn't anything they couldn't do to accommodate my guests. They allowed me to bring two cakes, they put them it in their refrigerator until serving time, then cut it in even pieces ready to serve.    We never had to give them any instructions, they knew exactly what to do.  At the end of 4 hours (which we didn't even feel), Everyone left happy and complimenting us for the awesome party the family had ever had in a while.

These are normally priced $3.50 and I'd still pay that price for them.. soo much yummier than the ones at the mall or the ballpark or wherever you usually eat pretzels.   I also recommend the Irish nachos for $2.50, and the pizza rollis for $2.75... if you are looking to get full on deliciously calorific junkfood at bargain basement prices, come here.  I'd mention as for the non-happy hour menu/prices.. I find this place like a better cheesecake factory. Better food, prices, etc.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant for the first time today and it was sort of... eh. I must say that the atmosphere is nice, our waitor was very attentive, & I did enjoy the complimentary bread.  We ordered sliders to start off... they were dry as its only cheese, a beef patty, & a bun. I would have added a chipotle mayo to tied it all together. The fries were delish though! I then had a Ceasar side salad and the Caesar dressing was completely flavorless. For the entree I chose the Ultimate Shrimp & Fish only thing I would criticize is the fried fish it came with I would have preferred talapia. Overall, I don't think it was worth the 75 $ bill.",

    "text": "My sister- in -law's and I wanted to take my mother- in -law out to an early mother's day lunch. Her choice was Claim Jumper! I was excited because I've heard good things about the food.   We went on a Saturday around noon and surprisingly it was not that busy. They quickly seated us at a table. I loved the chairs, being a larger girl, I appreciate a large chair with no sides.  The decor was like a large dining lodge. I enjoyed the low lighting and decent choice of music. I did not get a chance to visit the bar, but it looked like an excellent place to check out during happy hour.   Our waiter was on point. He quickly took our drink orders and left us to figure out what we wanted to order off of CJ's HUGE menu! ALL the things sounded good, but I ended up choosing the Original Tri-tip Dip sandwich with a side of seasoned fries. OMG was the sandwich good! There was tons of meat on it, as well as, caramelized onions, roasted peppers and smoked gouda on a French roll with au jus. I would go back just for this sandwich. The meat was tender and the onions were perfectly cooked. Dipping it in the au jus just perfected the bite you got. My mother- in- law ordered the famous chicken pot pie with fruit on the side. She said it had a flaky crust. The chicken was moist, and the sauce was the perfect texture. Mom said she really liked it and even enjoyed the fruit that came with it. My one sister-in-law choose the Widow Maker Burger with a side of seasoned fries. Let me tell you this thing was huge! She wasn't sure how she was going to get it in her mouth. It had a thick patty, smoked bacon, hand-battered onion rings, avocado, double-thick cheddar, mayo and red relish. She finished the whole thing! She said she loved it! I could tell she really did.  My other sister-in-law had the giant stuffed baker. It was a giant baked potato stuffed with charbroiled chicken, roasted vegetables topped with melted cheddar and jack cheese. Also, a cup of alfredo sauce to drizzle on top. She finished the whole thing as well! She said the chicken was not dry at all and the potato was cook perfectly.  To my surprise Claim Jumper was very reasonably priced! The service was excellent. Our waiter even made sure to bring me a cup of the au jus to take home with the other half of my sandwich. I for sure will be coming back and am planning on bringing my husband in for happy hour. Claim Jumper has an amazing variety in their menu that will please everybody from your young child to your grandparents and in between!",

    "text": "If you like to eat and can handle large portions then Claim Jumpers is your spot.  The desserts are flavorly and probably large enough to feed three people. My favorite dish here is the Pot Pie. The vegetables mixed with that creamy sauce is like no other. Combine it with that tasty, toasty crust and WOW what a great comfort food.  Service was average at best, but that's ok because the food more then made up for it. If I recall right our drinks never ran flat and we stayed topped off. I have eaten at many Claim Jumpers and this one can hang with the best of them.",

    "text": "Our reservation was for 6 pm on Christmas Eve. No wait. There were a lot more cars in the parking lot, so it looked like it was crowded (it filled up later on as the night progressed). In our party was my father-in-law, his wife, my husband's Grandma and her husband (came from Pahrump), and my husband and me (three generations).  Our server told us that there were a few changes made to the menu, since Landry's bought the chain out several months ago (which applied to two dinner entrees in our party- more detail later).  Our starter was two orders of the Calamari (thick cuts of calamari, not small rings), served with Asian Slaw (love this!), and cocktail sauce. We were waiting for the marinara sauce, too, but the cocktail sauce worked. The calamari was not the usual type, and was delicious (I want to order this next time!).   I was having a hard time deciding between three entrees (I've had many dishes and appetizers here; really miss the jambalaya), but I settled on the stuffed baked potato with veggies (carrots, zucchini, squash)- chicken- I chose blackened. Mine was huge! I knew that I would not finish this. My husband had his favorite dish here, meatloaf, which was not the same (smaller, he was disappointed). My father-in-law had the chicken fried steak (this was one of the changes that the server mentioned; my FIL said that there was a lot more breading this time around). His wife had the fish and chips (my co-worker had this at the company luncheon a couple weeks ago) and she shared (the fish was really good, good sized, meaty, not fishy or anything- I would order this, but would share it, too). My husband's Grandma and her husband had the sirloin tips (two of my co-workers had this as is) but substituted/opted the potato cakes- 2 (phenomenal!!!). We also had a drink (merlot, pina colada, white zinfandel) with dinner, too BTW. So, for the most part, four out of the six in our party, really enjoyed Christmas Eve dinner here.   The manager was sent over to explain that we could not use a partial credit (from $25 birthday reward) on my member card (this was not explained to us at our last visit to Rain Forest Cafe @ Downtown Disney) but he approved it anyway, and the tab was a little over $141.00. My overall rating of four stars is is still pretty good, what I had was really good, and the service was excellent. (One table didn't get their food, because it was mistakenly given to another table!) We would come here again (but for Christmas Eve dinner, it's always a different place every year).",

    "text": "Awesome food I had the Tri-tip steak with grilled shrimp and baked potato. Absolutely delicious the grilled shrimp were a nice size , the steak was tender and the glace sauce divine. My baked sweet potato was so huge I could have shared it with two others LOL. And the spiced butter complimented the sweet potato nicely. I highly recommend Claim Jumpers their prices are a bit high but worth every dollar. Our waiter was very courteous and attentive. The atmosphere reminds you of a cozy cabin type restaurant in the mountains. It has chairs that look like they were cut from logs and the booths are very spacious too. I highly recommend you give this place a try.",
