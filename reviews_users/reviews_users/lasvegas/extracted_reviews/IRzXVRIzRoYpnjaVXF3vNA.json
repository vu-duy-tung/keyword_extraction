    "text": "The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the food is actually good. With that said the service is horrible, to start it took the server, in a mostly empty dinning room, 30 min to attend the table. When he did show up he brought us menus but never asked if we would like a drink. When he finally returned to take our order he still didn't take our drink order and almost left the table before we all gave our order only staying because we had to bring it to his attention. Once the food was delivered he never returned to see if we needed anything else. We had to flag him down to ask for drinks and he again walked away while we were still ordering. Lastly they charge an automatic 20% gratuity to the bill. Needless to say this was the entire meal experience; unimpressive and lacking. Never coming here again, which is sad because I like the SLS hotel.",

Unfortunately great things don't last forever and we came to find it replaced with mediocre food and overall slow and unresponsive service.   Wait in line was about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning. Ordered pancakes and an omelette and took about 15 minutes to come out before finding out the server got the wrong pancakes ordered for us. Got the replacement in a few minutes (would have been nice if our original order was that fast). Nothing memorable about the food, which was the exact opposite experience (and the reason we longed to go back) when it was The Griddle Cafe.   Took us 10 minutes to track down the server to pay and even to come back to pick up our card for payment. Lots of empty tables around us by that point.",

Clearly this place is staffed by a millennial generation of would be dancers or musicians who would clearly rather dream of making it big then focus on the job at hand of bringing me my food.

Oh, and their cucumber margarita is spot on. Refreshing and literally intoxicating!

This coming weekend I'm sure the crowds will be starting to form and this place will be packed (not to mention the Rock In Rio crowds later in the month)! The last time I was here, I had an order of nachos which was really yummy and the gf had the infamous pastrami sandwich. Our server on the graveyard shift was Nicole and she provided great service and was the reason we ordered the nachos. She was very knowledgable about the menu and was very friendly and pleasant.  Tonight we're here on the graveyard shift an the restaurant is about 1/3 full. Still a decent sized crowd for a Wednesday with not too much going on in town.  Tonight's server is Henry. He did a good job, was attentive and on top of things. I like the fact that the tables here are cleaned and reset quickly and that the food I had here is consistent.  I just had a taste of the gf's turkey wrap and it's pretty tasty. Her fries were good too... Still thinking about those nachos... Lol. Thanks Nicole. :) we'll be back.",

They lasted five months before they packed up and returned to LA for unstated reasons.  The only things this place kept from the GC were the French press coffee makers (good call) and the prices (bad call). I don't mind paying $14 for a great breakfast, but not a lousy one.  The coffee was $5.  We got the hash and eggs. It was very small and the corned beef hash was tough and fatty. We mentioned it to our waiter and he just agreed and seemed as if he heard that sort of complaint all day.  The meal was comped, so we didn't complain too much. We assumed everything would taste lousy at that point, so we didn't ask for anything else.",

Joseph is a real gem there, he should be cloned and spread all over the place. Quick, personable, good salesman but not too pushy. He hooked us on Mojitos there (kudos to the bartender, tasted the same every time. Fantastic)  The food is solid. Chinese was good but a bit too salty. Looks like the kitchen also serves in room dining (same items) and the pool. You can tell by the quality of food there is a chef with a brain and skill behind this.   The downside is dinner service. We came a couple of times around 5-7 pm and good luck trying to find a server that cares. I understand this is downtime but basic sequence of service should be followed. At some point there was literally noone on the floor we could ask for anything. Food was still good but service subpar.",

I can honestly say amongst everything we had in our 3 day trip to Vegas, that this cafe was the BEST!(No, I am NOT kidding). We got the chicken tenders basket, which were the best tenders I have EVER had (sorry Culver's!) and my boyfriend got the nacho's and said they were \"bomb-diggity\" (basically, they were awesome).  We ate at many other \"well known\" establishments throughout our trip and were horribly disappointed, and spent WAY more money, I wish we had skipped a \"must eat\" restaurant (or two) and just eaten here again, and tried something new!  Servers are awesome and attentive, we will be staying at SLS on our next trip, and will absolutely be eating here (at least once or twice!). Highly recommend!",

The hostesses and waiters are polite and very helpful and attentive but the food is eh... Iffy.  And it also took forever to come out, in a non-crowded place.  I had the popcorn shrimp w/ cocktail sauce and it was okay. It came with pieces of popcorn sprinkled about the plate. Cool theme I suppose. Anyway... It was seasoned well and the sauce was tasty, only came with a few shrimp though.   The chicken tacos were a big disappointment. Chicken was cooked well but not seasoned at all, bland. Tortillas were dry, pico de gallo was okay but as a whole it wasn't pleasant.   I think the best bet going here will be to order breakfast food(served all day)...",

The pork tacos were bland and tasteless. How do you mess up tacos? The steamed buns came out cut open on top and the spongey dough began to harden before I could even finish. Service wasn't great either. The value of what you are getting is poor when you consider the price. But it's the only thing available 24/7 in the SLS.",

The only this is I wish that I had shredded potatoes instead of the whole quarter cuts. So in some bites I didn't just end up with a mouth full of potatoes and not being able to enjoy the egg, cheese, peppers,  or the chorizo. It came with a small side of Pico, which honestly I would've preferred salsa. The green chiles salsa added a hint of like flavor which was a great kick.  Over all I enjoyed the burrito and presentation.  Wifey had the Philly cheese steak which was tender and bread was so soft felt like it melted in your mouth. It was superb and I would recommend it. They sell both sides all day.  My server was average nothing was outstanding and there was a 20 min wait for a water refill. The noise level was enjoyable a mixture of music. The environment does gives off an 70's dinner fill.  The place wasnt jammed busy but this is a THURSDAY .",

I came in twice during my stay at SLS because it was open late and there were vegan/gluten free options. On my second visit Mike welcomed me back by name, with a big smile. I dined alone both times and left with a feeling like I had just dined with old friends. You just can't beat that. Love this town, love these people, just a great experience. Cheers y'all!",

They also have an attitude (they think they are better than you because they are sitting you?) I'm not sure.   But to the food.  The waffle with all the fixings was great!  Such a large serving with fresh fruit and very tasty with your choice of syrup.  This plate cost the Vegas price of $14.95.",

Then, combined with the fact that buffet has closed at SLS over the last year, too, well, I reluctantly tried the Northside Cafe.  The menu is nice.  Open 24/7, they have lots of options and separate menus for each sitting.  I went for breakfast, and returned gladly for breakfast again the next.  A nice experience with a small french press for coffee ($4.95), the scrumptious and elaborate Greek Yogurt Parfait ($9.95), and the Breakfast Burrito ($13.95) were all very worthy.  Mixed great breakfast food with lovely service and you have yourself a winner.",

He moves at the speed of life and made breaking bread extraordinary. He was also tastefully playful as he and his coworker posed in the background of our selfie. Very fun group.  Food was above expectations (one and half stars) The ordered food was as good to look at as it was full of flavor. There was a twist to the huevos rancheros that I didn't expect - the corn tortilla was crunchy and a pepper was placed on the top to nibble on throughout the meal. My wife had the chorizo that I nibbled on too - a bit salty with a slight kick. Eat these dishes fast otherwise these crispy delights will go soggy.  The theme of the restaurant is modern Vegas, which is consistent with the SLS hotel. The name of the restaurant has something to do with Chinese, but I didn't see any of that here. They are priced above average for the product delivered, but that's just Vegas. The music varies with weekend, it was cowboy Christmas when we came, so country was rocking this place when we were there. They have some small TVs in the back playing football. (One star)  Four and a half, but with the price, I'd give it just a four.",

Back to school I wouldn't say that's odd but typically it seems like African-American people always sat in the world right now away from playing a general population site. Not saying anything about this place here it's just something to think about. If it was all right here. Nothing spectacular and it wasn't terrible that you never come back. It's just not a place you would recommend somebody go to if they were in the Vegas area. If your hungry and at the SLS then sure this is OK to try out. The menu has a great variety of food so there is definitely something there for everyone. All in all I will likely go back because it's close to the SLS pool, but if I'm not staying at the SLS I have no reason to be here.   #EatHereOrNot",

    "text": "Located inside the SLS, Northside Cafe is the only restaurant open 24/7 with a wide selection of American and Chinese foods. It's located right across from the pool entrance and also next to the other Chinese restaurant. Entrees are on the expensive side and the taste quality doesn't match the $$$ tag. The room service food you order come from the kitchens inside Northside Cafe.   Ambience (4/5): Restaurant is very sleek looking. Cafe was never empty the two times I was there, tons of occupied tables. There are both large booths and small tables for any party size. Great place for people watching too, as you get get all sorts of people walking into grab a bite.  Food (2.5/5): I ordered the beef chow fun and the Char Su buns. Beef chow fun had a great taste despite there being way more vegetables than actual noodles and protein. The char su buns was a disappointment though. Despite its high price point for two small buns ($6), the buns were not  made in-house. Most likely ordered from a frozen food purveyor. the bun texture was very doughy and didn't have much meat inside.   Service (4/5): Table was not very clean when I was seated. I had to ask one of the staff members to wipe it again. Otherwise, service was excellent.   I would definitely try Northside Cafe again if I find myself on the North side of the strip late at night. I would just stay away from the Asian menu/selection.",

We came here for breakfast - we ordered coffee, a breakfast burrito and eggs Benedict. When I added milk to my coffee, it curdled up and floated in chunks to the top. Gross. I told the waitress and she got me a new coffee and milk. The new one had one small curdle but I drank it anyway because I am a coffee fiend and was coffee-deprived. The coffee was also very weak...you could see right through it (see my picture). We didn't want to complain and wait again so we just drank it. The second refill was better. The cups were tiny though (I'd say 4 ounces) and they cost $4 each with free refills. We only got two cups each and were not offered additional refills before getting the check. We saw other people walking out with to-go cups so we asked for the same. I kind of expected the coffee to be taken off the bill (since the milk was spoiled)  but it wasn't.  My breakfast burrito tasted good but it was 80% potatoes, which I would not expect at a price of $15. The eggs benedict was okay also.  If you are a coffee enthusiast staying at SLS Vegas, I'd definitely recommend Perq, their coffee was delicious.",

Bad customer service, and not recommended for hotel guests. We finally walked out after 20 minutes. This was May 25th around 6 pm. They need CS training or get people that know what CS is.  So sad.",

    "text": "Friends and I are at the SLS for a business event. We chose the Northside Cafe for mealtime...We were so glad we did! Everyone at the table had complimentary things to say about their meals! I ordered a cheese sandwich (mmmm-mm yummy provolone) and a roasted tomato soup. The pesto garnish was delicious. I sampled my husbands Asian dish and it was tasty too. The Jasmine rice was moist, the chicken and sweet and sour sauce was good too. The service was really on point thank you Joseph. We noted suddenly that we had run out of time and Joseph helped to get the check handled. Another thing I enjoyed was having the staff ask about our experience as well...Louis the assistant general Mgr was there when I asked for a business card. He was interactive was wanting to make sure we were being helped. This staff seems to work well together.... And we were able to get out the door and on to business. Such a great example of being concerned for  the customers needs. We will definately be back",

Also, the Hog omelet was delic and the ham made that omelet scream. I ordered the pork and eggs w potatoes dish. I believe the menu says it has jalepanos but I didn't really taste any spice but I did enjoy their table hot sauce. Try them out!

    "text": "So here's the deal,  I like the wide variety of things on the menu. They're open 24/7 and have a causal vibe with a decent ambiance.  You can get anything from traditional diner breakfast to Italian,  Mexican,  and Chinese.  So if it's late night and you don't know what you want, it's a nice spot.  However,  I'm thinking that with this wide variety,  the quality may suffer.   I ordered the parpadelle with short rib ragu.  Sounds delicious doesn't it? Well I'd say it was an issue with quality of ingredients, and partially preparation.  The short ribs were tough and chewy and not trimmed properly,  and the parpadelle was slightly undercooked. My friend ordered a cheese steak sandwich and her said it was... Ok.   All in all not too bad,  but not that good.  And we were also waiting to be helped for about 20 minutes before anyone came to the table.  I think it was a miscommunication on who's section the table was in,  so I understand,  but still...  Has potential,  could use some work.",

I'm pretty sure deciding to get dinner after 11PM is a regular occasion in Vegas. I ended up just getting chips and guacamole. My guacamole was disgusting, old, with slimy onions and cilantro. I would have ordered a fresh batch, but it took 20 minutes for the server to come back and check on us, and my friends had already finished their entrees. Also, the server acted annoyed when I asked if the kitchen could  make me anything vegetarian. Basically, he just cut me off and told me there was nothing the kitchen could do because it was 11:10. I find it hard to believe a staffed and stocked kitchen can't make a meatless entree on the fly. Then again, they can't even make decent guacamole. At least the chips we're crispy, and the salsa was okay.",

We were going to go to Umami Burger but they were closed, so we saw this eatery as a convenient option since we were hungry, and they were open until late.  I like that they had their menu outside. There were a lot of options, and the cafe looked clean and well-kept. Our server was nice and informative.   We ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which was starred as one of their favorites. It was tasty and not too spicy. Perfect, since my nephews were with us. We also ordered the fried rice and had requested the chicken on the side. This was comparable to other Chinese-style fried rice dishes I've had before. We also ordered the Orange Chicken, also good but not too much of a orange flavor sauce. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was very tasty and the shrimp was big. It was on the pricey side of $16.95, but worth it. Actually, all of their prices were a little on the higher-end, in my opinion.  The Eggplant Tofu was just okay. We agreed that it lacked flavor, almost like it needed more of a garlic or ginger taste, or both, even maybe a little more salt, which is unusual since Chinese food is usually really salty. The Pan Fried Noodles was good; and we were happy to find out it was much like our Cake Noodles in Hawaii, our home. It was crunchy but soft too with the gravy. It had Gai Lan and mushrooms on it. I would come here again if I was craving Chinese food in Las Vegas.",

The options at the SLS aren't that great but Northside Cafe looked promising (for a Cafe in a casino).  Me and wife but got breakfast options,  the ham steak and eggs and corned beef hash.   The ham steak and eggs was good and a the portion size was decent...the corned beef hash was also pretty good (massive amounts of butter!) but the portion size was comically small.  The bloody mary was decent and oddly enough the standout item from this meal was the piece of Rye toast I got with my ham steak and egg.  For some reason it was just really delicious.  The price is typical for this type of place,  ~15 dollars an entree.     I was considering giving this place 4 stars because in terms of the food it's actually in the upper half of casino cafes but the hostess was really rude (or just clueless?).   When we were leaving, I asked the hostess if there was a place in the hotel that served coffee.  She was like well we serve coffee here...and gave me attitude while pointing to the sign above her saying \"well this is a CAFE.\"    I was like uh...ok.      Technically what she said isn't wrong but it's how she said it that's the problem.",

So no food for me...   Sure they discounted our tables' meals, but since I ordered the soup and bun, l left with no meal. This was a horrible experience! Go elsewhere.

They have American, Mexican and Chinese menu items - random combination but I guess catering all tastes.   We stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacation Stay on Las Vegas Blvd., this was a decent restaurant within a 5 minute walking distance.   Wait was about 15-20 minutes for a Friday morning, not too bad. Our waitress was super busy, we didn't see her until 30 minutes after we sat down (the hostess had to take our drink and food orders). There was no wait when we came for dinner.",

I asked for buffalo sauce to liven the party and it worked.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  All of my requests were granted without a fuss.  As for a quick meal, this place is fine--if a little overpriced.  However, the other food choices are so much better here that I can only see myself choosing this spot  for convenience.",

The waiter was great - quick, friendly, and accurate and the place was clean.  We're both on a health kick, so we needed to modify our orders a tad.  I had the protein frittata with added mushroom and no toast and he ordered the steak and eggs with added spinach and no potato and no bread.  The order came out perfect - eggs over medium, steak medium rare. Everything was perfect. The food itself was good   Overall very good experience. A tad pricey, but it's convenient.",

    "text": "Likely one of the most saddened persons in Las Vegas when The Griddle Cafe at SLS suddenly shuttered, but impressed by Northside Cafe during a substantial breakfast just days after the switch, it was on the invite of SBE's Director of Dining that myself and five friends sat down to experience the restaurant's newly launched dinner and late night menus this past Saturday - a total of 32 plates showing a great degree of diversity with the majority far better than one would expect from 24/7 dining, though one specific section proved barely passable at best.  Admitting up front that the experience was fully comped, a few requests made of the kitchen while the vast majority of the items were served carte blanche, it was at a large booth in the far corner of the room that our party was sat and with IHeartRadio playing lightly overhead the meal was presented with exemplary service, first bites of shrimp atop popcorn perhaps a bit *too* clever for their own good while the stack of banana pancakes served a strong reminder of the high quality marking my aforementioned breakfast, the pure maple syrup presented steaming hot and drizzled liberally to our heart's content.  Opting next to send out dinner entrees, the later rounds focused on recently launched dim sum and Chinese plates, Northside Cafe certainly is not skimping on ingredient quality as both the rib eye and filet were served a juicy medium rare, the trio of snappy shrimp deftly doused in garlic while asparagus and potatoes were both as good as upscale steakhouse fare.  Blase as ever about salmon, the fish itself nicely cooked though a bit lost amidst all the brightly citrus sauce, a duo of pastas was presented simultaneously with far more balance, the fettuccine cooked perfectly al dente with heavy cream laced inn garlic while the cheesy pockets of ravioli were quickly devoured by the left half of the table, the simplicity of the crushed tomatoes and herbs praised by an Italian at the table reminiscing of his grandmother's red sauce.  Transitioning abruptly to Chinese, the next nine plates offered on a newly launched list of dim sum, suffice it to say that substantial tweaks are needed before this part of the menu can be appropriately recommended, the fried items by far the best of the group while pork was sticky and far too sweet, the steamed options universally overcooked as if by an inexperienced hand,  Admittedly shocked by the drop in quality, and soon to become even more confused by the fact that actual Chinese entrees were confidently prepared as if by an entirely different kitchen compared to those sent out before, it was to a whole steamed bass that eyes were next widened, the flesh rich and moist with a delicate bit of lemon and lovely top-notes of scallions and lemongrass.  At this point already overserved, some items boxed for home while others unfortunately went to waste, it was still to nine more full-size plates that the slowly dwindling table was treated, the salt and pepper  dazzling beneath delicate batter while fried rice, chow fun, and everything made with noodles was on par with the best of Spring Mountain Road, without too substantial a hike in price.  Dining partners already waiving the white flag, or at least folding napkins and debating the pros and cons of renting a room within the hotel rather than carrying the food coma home, it was with five desserts that the evening would end and although the cookie was far less 'gooey' than one may have expected there was no lack of quality anywhere else, the fruited options each outstripping modest expectations while the peanut butter cup studded cheesecake was silky, smooth, and not oversweetened, the bread pudding taking the opposite path in offering the steamy custard block topped in ice cream with a shallow pool of golden brown sauce.  ****Offering better food than almost any 24/7 spot in Las Vegas, with prices far more forgiving for comparable items than at places further South on the Strip, Northside Cafe continues to impress on a level far greater than passers-by may notice, the dim-sum menu a lone exception while breakfast, dinner, Chinese plates, and desserts offer plenty of well-priced hits.",

Took 7 minutes for someone to attend to the front desk and she told me to go to the bar for my pick up (which I never needed to do before). Waited another 10mins to pick up my order (keep in mind I called 20mins prior to place the order and was told it was going to take 10-15 minutes). Biggest annoyance and why I left to write this message, is after all of that, (wasting my time) they forgot my toast, which I didn't realize until I was at the airport. Come on guys, you literally ruined the experience....",

I found that there is a chandelier made out of the old Sahara hotels door knobs, there is also an installment of the old chandeliers is right in front of the pool, and at this restaurant there used to be a place called the griddle which had scratch and sniff wallpaper.   Well the griddle is gone, and Northside Cafe stands in its spot. As I approached the hostess stand, it was a young lady named Mercedes, who asked about the old wallpaper. It just so happened that I've bit of the old wallpaper is in the glass casing in front of the new restaurant. She was so sweet, and she even allowed me to literally scratch and sniff the wallpaper LOL. And yes it still smells good LOL she did not have to do this for me but it made my day for someone who is a researcher like myself LOL make sure you stop by and see her at this place!",

Firstly, the menu was unique as it had diner dishes beside Chinese food, and waiter, Oliver, proficiently laid out some options for me based on what I wanted. I ended up with a rice with chicken and shrimp dish that was excellent. Oliver was a wonderful attendant, but topped all when he and my best friend coordinated bringing me a birthday cake--candle and all. Made my day.   This unique cafe is a must visit for a quick, but high-end bite. And be sure to ask to sit in Oliver's section for an expert experience.",

Felt like it was missing something but couldn't really say what would improve this dish.  Huge potato pieces in a big burrito were a bit overwhelming but not a bad choice if you are in the mood for a burrito.  Good quality coffee.  Service here is always good.  This restaurant is clean and the open kitchen is immaculate.  Northside Cafe is definitely a solid choice if you are seeking a diner type meal especially at odd hours. Alcohol is available.  Prices are moderate.  Didn't save my check but the Greek salad with shrimp is about $16.00.",

Every time it's been disengaged staffed, incorrect orders, long wait times... And who doesn't carry honey mustard???   ON TODAY'S visit, the one that sealed the fate and earned this review was brought to you by the inability to cook eggs. I ordered mine over medium. They brought me over easy. I asked, \"hey. These are over easy. Can I get the over medium please?\" \"No problem. I put in for over medium, but I'll ask again and add 'well done'.\" A few hours later, once my sausage and potatoes are cold, they bring out 2 more, over easy eggs. I poke them... to confirm they are just two more eggs over easy, and yes they are. My server goes, \"Are those medium enough?\" I was like, \"...um... No they are over easy too...\" And he goes, \"Well those are OUR over medium.\"  LOL WAT  Followed up with, \"You must really know your eggs!\"  Yes. Sir. Knowing the difference between over easy and over medium makes me quite the connoisseur.  TL;DR Service is bland, food is slow, lighting is harsh.

I could not have been happier.  The steak melted in my mouth, the shrimp was tasty and my side of asparagus was wonderful.  It was the perfect amount and very very good.  My husband wasn't as crazy about his pasta with chicken but I gave it 5 stars because of the great service and my excellent meal.  Give it a try!!",

Regardless, I found myself returning every afternoon to feast at the SLS Diner. I remember ordering the protein scramble and I loved it because it was made with egg whites. Any restaurant that offers an egg white option deserves mad respect in my books. I guess the only small complaint I have is that it's tad on the pricier side, which I really don't mind all that much. My African-Filipino-American roommate ordered the sweet potato fries and he literally fell in love with it. He's the type of person to never consume unhealthy dining options; however, every time a side order of sweet potato fries ends up on the dining table. Even though I'm not a fan of sweets, I decided to try it myself. Let me tell you this, I guarantee it won't be a disappointment.",

So we ended up eating breakfast there our first morning, and then once more for a small dinner.  It is overpriced, and the food is terrible.  My husband ordered steel-cut oatmeal, and I ordered pancakes.  His oatmeal was something like $12, which seems like a joke.  And my pancakes were dense and flavorless.   Another time, we just got soup and salad.  We had the cobb salad, which was lacking in flavor and ingredients.  And I got the roasted tomato soup, which I am certain came from a can or container.  I also had the \"warm cookie\" and ice cream dessert, which came on a scone instead.  The ice cream, even, was terrible.  Most disappointing experience of our Vegas stay.  Every other restaurant we tried had a standard far above Northside's; this place needs to straighten up.",

The bad, it is outrageously priced. Portion sizes are large however. I had a Rigatoni I could not finish and was delicious.  My wife ordered a fish that she ate and said nothing about.  My son, and this is where the rating went down, ordered Nachos. That is simple enough. But, he did not want Jalapenos on it and specified it. He was disappointed when it came out clearly with Jalapenos on it. He decided to try his hand at telling the waiter. He very politely said he was disappointed it had Jalapenos on it. The waiter brushed it off by saying it was due to the pico de gallo. UH NO! We looked first and tried that. It was all over the large plate, inside and out. You messed up, just apologize no excuses. They did correct it by sending a new plate quickly with no pico di gallo. Now it was just the ample beef, sour cream and nachos.  What you could have done, apologized and offered to take it off the bill or complimentary dessert. NOPE. Just the excuse was offered. We can tell the difference between something mixed into a condiment and fresh Jalapeno thrown onto the plate and in the nachos.   So, high price and doing poorly on something very easy to put together results in a lower rank.  It could have been a 3 or 4.",

I did not have the desset because by this point I was feeling quesy. When I asked how much a glass of wine cost since it is not listed on the menu, I was informed that it is $11. What? That is cray.

What was i thinking eating Chinese food at a place that serves burgers, and pancakes all on the same menu, but with prices that are higher than some Vegas buffets? But my feet were tired, and it takes forever to get out of the casino mazes. These sort of restaurants are the perfect trick for casinos to keep you within their fortress, because they got a lil bit of everything. The menu is really all over the place, and you know it was put together to try and satisfy the diverse clientele they have. Which is probably what you can say about a 7-11 as well.   I ordered the Yang Chow fried rice. And it was an epiphany. It was the 1st time I ever thought, wow, it IS possible to screw up fried rice. As if the shrimp was left over from a buffet, the rice came in an orange box with the words \"Uncle Ben\" on it, and the flavor was sprinkled with cardboard.   The Dr. Pepper was good. The soda machine mixed in some root beer flavor. And that's cool with me because I love mad mixing soda.",

Tonight, while doing some gambling at the SLS, we decided to grab a bite to eat here.  Ordered-  - Combination Fried Rice ($11.95) with pork, shrimp, and chicken - Orde of Chicken Wings (plain) ($9.95) with ranch sauce on the side - 1 side order of Garlic Mashed Potatoes ($6.95) - 1 Diet Pepsi, 1 Water  (+) Service was probably the best thing about this experience, as the young lady who waited on us was friendly and attentive, certainly no complaints regarding the service (+) chicken wings were actually pretty good! Only 6 to an order, but at least they were tasty.  (-) garlic mashed potatoes were a huge disappointment. First, the portion size was pathetic. This was roughly about 6-7 bites. This should have run $3 at the most. $6.95 is downright criminal. Plus their definition of garlic was ready mix mashed potatoes with a few garlic dices on top. Very disappointing. (-) Combo Fried Rice was plentiful in portion, but extremely bland. At least I know they don't use any MSG in their Chinese foods. That dish was way too bland to have included any measurable amount of MSG!  Maybe one day we will return to try some of the breakfast menu items, but this was a bit of a letdown and I don't see myself going out of my way to go back..  Maybe I will try Ku Noodle next...after all I am one of those rare locals that actually likes playing at the SLS...  for Northside Cafe though, it will have to be..  2 stars.  Meh.

I had the breakfast and it was hearty.  I have tried their Chinese menu.  The Kung Pao Chicken and Eggplant dish they were Asian but something was missing.  Can't think of it but I will update later.  Because it was right next to the slot machines the ambiance was loud and bright.  Sometimes there is a line to get in.  The food is a bit pricey.  They are open 24/7 that's a huge plus.",

    "text": "Service was very good but that's where the goodness stopped.   It was late so we opted to choose a few selections off of the Chinese small plates menu, although they do serve non-Chinese entrees as well. I thought since it was a Chinese cafe, the Chinese food would possibly be better. Nope.   We started with the Hot & Sour soup. It was decent. A little thicker than I'm used to. It was much heavier than a broth consistency. Otherwise, it was pretty traditional. It actually was a tiny bit hot which I really appreciate. The flavor was okay.   Next, the pork steamed buns, which took 20+ minutes to prepare per the server, were undercooked and doughy. This is one of my favorite dishes and I do know how it is when cooked correctly. They barely had any pork in them at all either. It was more of a very thin smear of pork paste when I opened it to see if it actually had any pork in it after not having any in my first 2-3 bites. The flavor was also missing.   We also tried the pan fried dumplings. It was a combo of pork and shrimp. This did not work. At all. Weirdest fishy flavor ever.   Next we ordered the veggie spring rolls because we were 0-2. They were okay. Traditional but again, no flavor.   I would certainly skip this place unless it's after hours and it is the only restaurant in the SLS/W that is open 24/7.  But I would suggest staying away from the Chinese menu. I saw a pasta dish come out that looked good.   In all fairness though, this cafe does the room service for the W and breakfast the following morning was good. I had the breakfast burrito and I would order it again. So I give 3 stars for that instead of the 2 stars originally planned.",

They had a very limited late night menu, but had all the usual suspects covered for that time of night, nachos, burgers, basic  breakfast etc. The nice thing was they had a pretty decent Chinese/Dim Sum menu available beginning at Midnight. I didn't grab one, but the table next to me did,  when you order coffee, you get French press. That's so nice, I wish more places offered that in place of drip coffee.   I had the Chow Fun some sticky rice and a fat slice of chocolate cake. Just the thing a fat kid needs after a long flight and day on the road.   The place was nearly empty when we were there. I would even eat here if I wasn't staying in the hotel.   I'm sure the SLS has some swankier dining experiences,  but if you're just looking for a casual place to grab some grub, this place will fit the bill.",

Prices are higher from where we are from but just about any place you get food from in Las Vegas is going to be pretty expensive. Our omelettes were phenomenal and we did get a lot of bang for our buck. Lots of options to choose from on the menu and they gave me so much food that I had to take my omelette back to the hotel to eat for breakfast the next day. They seemed to be really busy and forgot a number of things and took awhile. My mom's omelette which was supposed to have chunks of ham in it, didn't so our cook redid hers really fast and it came out just perfect! Servers and the cooks are very friendly and funny here. Customer service here is fantastic. I would say this is a good place to get breakfast and that I would come in again.",

Nice atmosphere/cool booths/retro chairs/nicely done interior.  The service was extremely slow--cordial enough, but oh so slow! Perhaps it was all the hungry tourists, or maybe all the locals came in for the 2 for one deal?  The food: Mixed reaction here: Husband said it was \"good\"--even though they brought him a different entree than what he ordered (he was too hungry to send it back)...I found the Chinese cuisine to be simply meh--not horrible, but not Wow! or anything.  Will we go back again? Yes, probably for a 2 for 1 deal--but will most likely do a salad or a sandwich--since the Chinese cuisine didn't cut the mustard for me.

Rigatoni was bad. Tasted prego-like and was also extremely salty. Even though the portion was good, I had to stop halfway because the salt was so overpowering. The only compliment is that there is plenty of meat in the sauce. The cheesecake was also below par, chalky, and honestly Jack in the box cheesecake is almost as good. At least it was nicely presented. I hesitate to drop my review from an initial 5 stars to 3, but God Damn that rigatoni.",

The sauce for the shrimp was spicy, creamy and heavenly. The steak was tender and delicious. The french fries were just right!

So their menu says \"breakfast 24 hours\" which my confused time zone of a body thinking it was probably post-bar, drunk food time decided that pancakes sound the best. When we tried to order pancakes the waitress said \"pancakes take too much prep time so they're not available\". These must be some serious pancakes because I've never heard of such elaborate preparation for a plop of runny cake batter like dough on a skillet...  They also have a secret menu if you ask but it's like a mini version of the regular menu all printed out. The whole point of the secret menu is for it to be secret and should never be written out for the average common folk meandering through Vegas to stumble upon.  Anyways, I got the Al Pastor tacos and they were good.",

And then ordering the Chinese food on that menu is very risky.  But I did it anyway.  I ordered the Chow Fun dish and it was surprisingly delicious.  The noodles were of great texture and the flavor was not overpowering.  Usually Chinese food can be overly salty, but this dish had the perfect amount.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the service leaves more to be desired.  I checked in late on a weeknight and was the only person in the restaurant, yet I had to grab my own menu after a few minutes of waiting around.  I actually was hesitant to recommend this place to my folks because I was worried about the quality of service during the actual busy breakfast/lunch/dinner hours.",

I give 3 stars due to the lack of service form our waiter Juan M. We seen him when we ordered dinner with desert and then the again for the bill. We had to ask 2 random employees that may have been hostesses and third who was waitressing the table next to us. Juan M was polite, and pleasant, I'm sure he is good at his job but The performance today with us was poor, we were left waiting and reaching out to other employees for service. Lastly when I ordered my Salmon meal it came with a Caesar salad, I asked for a Greek salad, he replied \"it will be an extra charge\" I agreed to it. When we got the check I noticed they not only was I charged extra but I was charged for a \" 1/2 salad . So since I was charged full price for a 1/2 Greek salad $7.95 what happened to the Caesar salad that came with the meal? So their just gonna keep my Cesar salad and charge me full price for the 1/2 Greek??? Not good business!!!  Sorry Juan M. But you still got your 15%.",

We are also staying at the SLS this weekend and he stays there for work on occasion.  It is convenient when you are staying there, however it ALWAYS takes forever to get your food and the service is subpar. It seems like the server to customer ratio is good,  so there isn't a shortage of staff however they all seem to be standing around doing nothing even when you have asked for something like another set of silverware or some more water.  There is no sense of urgency.  In addition the food is nothing special and isn't cheap (although I guess that is to be expected on the strip). I don't mind paying 14.00 for am omelette but I do expect it to taste good and have good service!",

Over time it's gone from amazing to okay and then to really bad. This place is really poorly managed, like bad! I don't know if it's because nobody wants to work here or they don't pay enough. Every time I come here it becomes worse and worse. So the last time I was here food was so dry and bad. So so disappointed. Will never come here again.

Thanks to Joseph who helped us decide our order and was patient and very friendly. Super prompt and checked on us throughout the entire meal. Definitely recommend the Northside Burger and fries as well as the Steamed Buns and Sesame Balls-Yum!",

The congee had the right balance and the fried Chinese doughnuts that came with it were the perfect match.   Now for everything else...the dimsum was 2/5 stars since the hargow was a bit hard and tasted like plastic and the shumai seemed alright but still mediocre. The walnut shrimp was decent but it's pretty \"normal\"..it also came with hard broccoli that was barely cooked (more of a garnish I think)  Everyone here complains about the service which needs a bit of work initially, but during the time we came it wasn't as busy so the service wasn't too bad. So they get a 4/5 from me",

We shared some dim sum and two dishes. Note: dim sum is made fresh and takes a bit of time so order that first! We tried the pork buns and chive dumplings. We also enjoyed the stir fry udon with beef, yang chow fried rice, and concluded the experience with a 6-layer chocolate cake. The food was excellent, the cake was ok. Perhaps it would have been better warm. And I will definitely return! Love me some udon!",

We ordered orange chicken, Kung pao chicken, fried rice, cake noodles, eggplant tofu, and walnut shrimp.  The star of the night was the cake noodles! So much flavor and a perfect combo of sauce and crunchy pan fried noodles.  The egg plant tofu lacked garlic and ginger but the tofu was cooked perfectly.

Their dimsum only opens from late night to 6 am so plan accordingly.  We stayed at the W hotel which is located \"inside\" the SLS hotel so it was really easy to walk downstairs and grab food whenever.  I ordered a Huevos Rancheros for $15 ish and thought it was super odd that mine would come on a hard shell taco instead of the usual soft tortillas which was really my fault bc it did state \"hard shelled taco\" on the menu :(. The meat also tasted like canned minced meat which I really wasn't a fan of...sorry I've been spoiled with the super cheesy, soft, melty ones you find in the mom & pop Mexican restaurants in Cali...

He's professional kindhearted and just an outstanding person. The food always comes quick and as busy as it can get he always has a genuine smile .  He sets the tone for a simple meal or just a nice quick bite. The food is delicious and served fresh every time.  This is a great place to grab a late night good bite every time and even better if Alex is working.    Thanks Alex for making me  always making me  feel welcomed @Northside SLS Las Vegas!

When we finished, another server approached and asked if we needed something and we said we needed the check.  He said, \"Oh, [guy's name] hasn't been back yet?\" and I said I hadn't seen him in a while. You know that kind of half-assed service where none of the servers take ownership of your table and they act like they're doing you a favor since your real server has forgotten you?  This place. Oh, and when they bring Chinese food/dim sum to the table they should bring it with all the Chinese condiments. They didn't.   Poor service and the food was OK.",

The benefits of this spot is that they are literally open 24 hours a day, with the changing of menus as well so it's not constantly the same thing.  The servers are super sweet and accommodating. The food is basic American food, but they do have a random Chinese menu which I heard was really good, but had not tried it. Prices are what you'd expect for Vegas diners. Expect to pay around $11-15 per person. The meals are larger than what I expected however so at least your money goes far!  Sub par food, excellent service.",

After doing the \"rounds\", we decided to come to Northside as they had a variety of food options.  I ordered the braised tofu with brown sauce with a side of brown rice, and it was excellent!  The side of rice was less than $2 and it was a good portion.  My boyfriend ordered a hamburger with fries, and my friend ordered chicken wings with fries.  All around, the food portions were big, and everything is reasonably priced for what you get.  It's cozy in there, but hip, and they do have televisions all around.  I would definitely eat here again.",

I ordered the Protein Frittata with no mushrooms.  It came with mushrooms cooked into it.  I had to pick around them as I didn't want to wait for them to re-make it.  The guac appetizer is quite good.  Service could certainly be improved here.",

If it's your birthday SLS invites code members for $30 off an order of at least $60 so my mom decided to invite my sister and I for a belated coupon redemption lol. The sign out front read \"seat yourself\", so we did at a nice big booth where literally 8 people can sit altogether. You know your a family when we all order different entrees just to switch plates to share with each other, at least thats what we always do. Nachos for appetizers, mom had the salmon, sister ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I had the fettuccini alfredo with added shrimp. All the dishes were very filling especially since we couldn't finish the pasta and had to take it to go. We ended with coffee and a slice of cheesecake which fit perfect with a bittersweetness after all the heavy meals. This cafe comes with a bar in the back and has a very open space about it. If you do check in through yelp there's a $5 off promo to use in any specialty cocktail.",

Probably better places to eat but I did like my sandwich.",

I eventually got so fed up of waiting at the restaurant with the apathetic staff, I went back up to my room and arranged for the room service staff to deliver my food for me.  The Chinese menu is solid, I will be going again for more when I get the bad taste of their (lack of) service out of my mouth.  + Hot and Sour Soup: Bold vinegar flavor with lots of tofu, bamboo, and wood-ear mushroom floating about. Came to me boiling hot, even with the 5 minute commute to my hotel room.  + Yang Chow Fried Rice: Interestingly included shredded iceberg lettuce in the mix. Shrimp were few but larger sized than other places.  +/- Pan Fried Dumplings: Three to an order, very juicy and well seasoned without being overly salty. Some pieces of pork in the filling were too grisly to chew so I wouldn't order this again.  - Staff will not offer you any updates or apologies while you are waiting at the counter for 20+ minutes after the promised time. They will not offer you something to eat while you wait, they will not apologize, they will not make eye contact with you, they will not acknowledge your presence at all. The one thing they will do, is give you your check as soon as you arrive, without telling you that your food is not ready.

    "text": "My friend took me to this cute little cafe while visiting the SLS hotel. The hostess seated us promptly and the menu had a lot of special breakfast and lunch choices. I ordered the L.E.O scramble which was an onion scramble layered with thick cuts of smoked salmon with a side of bagel and a dollop of sour cream. I really wanted to try their pancakes since it consisted of interesting combinations such as a carrrot cake style, red velvet pancake style, and the caaramelized banana pancake. I hadd to try it, but didn't want to order a whole order of it since it was a 3 stack.. Our waitress gave me the option of getting it as a side, so I ended up ordering a caramelized banana pancake. Our orders came all at once, and the portion size was huge! The pricing is a little higher than any other cafe's, but the portion size makes up for it. The food was delicious, and the pancake was REALLY, Melt in your mouth good!! the dynamic of all all the tastes just mesh together. We enjoyed our meals and had leftovers to take with us. Service was great, the food was great. I will be back :)   PS- it's open 24 hours, but will get really packed after midnight since the Foxtail nightclub is RIGHt next store.",

I would have rather spent time at the pool eating some snacks than at this restaurant for 2 hours... And the food was terrible.  I got an omelet and it tasted like garbage.

This time I had a party of 4 and we were allowed to order whatever we want. I order the club burger and I must say that was an incredible burger. The flavors were excellent. Then other members in my part have shrimp cob salad, avocado turkey could sandwich, the street tacos, torta and the blueberry pancakes. (My man Eric made sure they were cooked this time. ) All was delicious. We were pleased with our server Angela and the fact that they gave us the VIP treatment. Overall, awesome effort by the staff and the food was delicious.",

The Philly cheesesteak was another story: dry, untoasted dinner roll with dry steak and few mushrooms. It's definitely not worth it as it doesn't live up to expectations. Not to mention, the restaurant is right across from the pool entrance and my boyfriend had a perfect view of someone stumbling out and vomiting in the casino but hey, this is Vegas. Regardless, it was an okay experience just steer clear of the cheesesteak.",

Generally speaking, I was concerned about two things - quality of food (it was the only place open in SLS at that time) and quality of service (it was about 2AM and not very many people were there).  The Northside Cafe delivered on both counts.  The staff was friendly and attentive; there was not one moment where I was waiting for my drink to be refilled.  The food took a little bit longer than I expected (maybe 15 minutes for a burger and fries); however, it was well worth the wait.  The food was not only generously portioned; it was also delicious!  For bacon lovers, the Northside burger had great big pieces of thicker-than-normal bacon on it.  The burger was cooked to perfection.  If you like pickles, you get a whole dill pickle with the plate.  And for you fans of sweet potatoes - these sweet potato fries do not disappoint!  They had the perfect level of sweetness to them, and they were crispy.",

Specific ratings  Decor-5 Waitress-3 Potatoes-1 Pancakes-0 Bacon-0  As an avid SLS fan (I often visit the Beverly Hills location as well as the South Beach property (I was looking forward to luxury in Las Vegas.  The decor is absolutely gorgeous. It's a great mixture of modern trendiness with sleek elegance. It's spacious and easy to navigate to the restaurant. Bonus points for being 24 hours.   The waitress was friendly and attentive, although not very knowledgeable about the SPG/Starwood Rewards program.   My husband and I ordered pancakes, bacon and potatoes. The pancakes field entire plate, but had some type of generic butter. The butter tasted more like oil and butter. Another disappointment was the syrup. Not a recognizable name brand but a type of liquid make sure that was horrific. The pancakes had a doughy consistency that was so unpleasant, both my husband and I refused to eat more than 3 bites each.  Why have pancakes if they aren't sweet?   The bacon was thick but had over 50% fat, so that wasn't edible either. The potatoes would have been decent if they had served while still hot and had some type of seasoning.   My overall experience was so disappointing that I felt compelled to write this review. The experience didn't not live up to the image and expectations I have for SLS properties.  The guests behind our booth had the same experience with their food and ate even less of the pancakes then we did.  I can't say that I would recommend this restaurant, even for those looking for a basic late night meal.   I will be back this year in either July or September as I didn't get a chance to check out the gorgeous Fred Segal shoe boutique inside the SLS hotel.",

We were greeted by Eddie amd he started us off with two bloody marys. We needed some more time to look at the menu since it was our first visit. Eddie suggested the buttermilk pancakes and bacon, which we decided to try. They were amazingly delicious. We haven't had this type of hispitality in a long time. Eddie was very friendly and helped guide us through the menu. He made us feel at home. Whenever  we are in Vegas, we will stop by Northside Cafe for the hospitality and great food.",

By that time the food was cold. When I first cut into the Eggs Benedict the eggs were overcooked. After our waiter served our food we've never saw him again until it was time to bring the check.

    "text": "Let's start with the great- the food and the bartenders were it.  Joe and Joe V. are absolutely fantastic; they deserve raises. I had the nutella french toast with whipped cream; it was perfectly done and not soggy at all ( I stopped eating french toast as a child because everyone who made it for me, made it soggy- I actually thought that it was supposed to be that way- yuck).  I added a side a bacon and shared that with the boyfriend; four thick slices come with it.  The boyfriend had buttermilk pancakes which he was as equally satisfied with- they were light and fluffy and a nice big serving. The good- All patrons seemed to be satisfied with their food. The bad and it's bad- I'm not sure if the hostess was nervous or what.  There seemed to be an abundance of kitchen staff and waiters but she wasn't seating people. AND there were plenty of booths and table tops. We just stood in the line and she would come to the line and ask how many people every now and then-she didn't write any of this down. After 15 minutes in line she came and asked the couple in front of me if there were only two in their party-she left and didn't return although there were 3 2-tops available. My boyfriend spotted two people leaving the bar so he left the line and claimed the seats-I followed shortly and the family behind me left.  The couple in front of me finally got sick of waiting for one of the empty tables and  joined us at the bar twenty minutes later.  At least 6 tables stayed empty for half of our meal although there was a line and plenty of staff to handle them.   Note to Management: Your food is great- I would hate to see you lose great customers.  Please assist the hostess and come up with a better way of seating and serving customers when you have a full staff available.",

We went back the next afternoon (we ate there 3x during our vaca) this time the service was very sketchy, meaning we sat for quite awhile after being seated with no acknowledgement at all, mind you we were seated in the booth directly in front of the \"servers\" station.

The managers excuse was he didn't see us sit down. Which was a lie because when we walked in he greeted us along with two other servers, and we sat in the booth right in front of his station. Maybe you should change your \"Seat Yourself\" policy because apparently the servers and managers are in that much of a deep convo, with nothing to do lounging around that they \"Did not see us sit down\" while it was pretty much empty. We should of just ordered from our room, we probably would of gotten great service that way, like we did this morning for breakfast.

    "text": "The food was pretty good. Nothing great but definitely not bad. Very basic menu with a lot of variety, which I like when I don't know what I want or when with a group.   I dined here twice on my trip in Vegas.   The first was right around midnight, my BF and I ordered to-go meals to take to the room. The girl was nice and after taking our order, offered for us to sit in a corner booth to wait for our food since it would take 10 minutes or so. We took our seat and waited. and waited. and waited. a good 25-30 minutes later, we realized we hadn't gotten our food, and not one person came up to us to let us know our food was ready or not. So I got up to ask the girl what was going on, she had our food sitting on the back counter. She asked my name and gave me the bag. Once in the room, the food was pretty lukewarm. Not a huge deal, but I just wish she would have kept a better read of the situation. We were maybe 5 steps from where she was, right around the corner. Aw well. Food was fine.  The second time was the morning we were leaving, grabbing breakfast before hitting the road. The server was nice, took our order since we were ready quickly. Food and drinks came out semi quick and were all delivered by different people. When our food was dropped off, I asked for more ketchup since ours was empty. He said, \"okay\" in a somewhat confused voice and never returned. A server never really came back until we flagged someone down that we were ready for the check, after sitting there with empty plates for a few minutes. Now, I have worked as a server in the past, so I get it when you're busy, but there is still a way to keep up with your tables or have someone else do it. The real problem is that the restaurant was not super busy. maybe 3/4 full and I saw at least 10-12 employees buzzing around so didn't seem under staffed.   Eat here if you don't care about customer service or if you're not in a rush. The food is decent and they have a lot to chose from. At least when you DO get to interact with the employees, most of them are quite nice.",

    "text": "I'm about to go in y'all.   So I took my family members who were visiting from out of town to what I thought would be The Griddle House. To my surprise GH was no longer there. They have replaced it with Northside Cafe and an all new menu. We were hungry, I hoped SLS wouldn't disappoint, and so we decided to give it a try.   Service was extremely slow: The place is absolutely empty but we receive service like it's jam packed with clients.   Extremely subpar service from waiter:  -I ask the waiter what he prefers from the menu. He shares, \"I don't know just pick.\"  -Later, we ask for straws and he tells us that they \"ran out of straws\". My first thought is, 'Where they do dat at?' Anyway, we go out of our way to find a busboy who gives us straws on the spot. When the waiter comes back and sees that we have straws, he looks stifled and upset. From that point on he only returned to the table to give us the bill.   Here's my assessment: The Griddle House brought high hopes for dining at SLS. Unfortunately, NSC is not holding its own properly. Northside Cafe will need to step up its game either through new management, servers and menu to stay in the market.",

I dined as a few friends and identified ourselves as locals with ID in hands. Despite being confirmed by our server, we charged full price for everything we ordered. Upon bringing it up to our server she informed us that our card was missing a sticker identifying us as locals despite having our IDs showing our addresses in hand. It would have been nice to know that when we told you that we we locals before we ordered. Whatever.  I probably wouldn't have been that annoyed if the food had actually been worth the price. It wasn't. Northside is mostly traditional cafe fare you can find pretty much anywhere. The fries from my burger were cold and had clearly been sitting there for a while. The street tacos were tiny. Fortunately the banana pancakes were good, a hold over on the menu from the previous Griddle Cafe.   Service was a disaster from start to finish. 30 minute wait time and food took forever to come out. We had to flag down our server for refills and to get our order in. I understand  that all new restaurants have issues starting off but this was just a catastrophe. 1 star! Smh all day.",

I was told by the Northside cafe manager that the las vegas local that they meant was the surrounding apartments and pretty much within SLS vicinity.     I'm not big on writing reviews but this place was just too much!  I had breakfast there this morning and the hostess specifically gave us the \"local secret menu\" instead of the regular menu. We were seated at the bar and the service was ok and the food was ok too for the price that was on that local menu. When I asked for the bill I noticed that I was charged with the full price from the regular menu. When I asked the server why I was charged full price all he said was \"oh you're supposed to have a little sticker on your code card and there's nothing I can do about it\" and this guy is holding my nevada ID with las vegas address on it! How local do you have to be???  This place is ridiculous I am never going back there! So locals beware don't even bother  asking for the specials they have for locals.",

They were unable to accommodate my request for greens or veggies in lieu of potatoes and toast. I guess gluttony and Sin City go hand-in-hand.  My fiance said his 2 egg breakfast with bacon and potatoes was fine, but it's hard to mess up eggs...you know, unless you toss some metal bits in there or something.  The manager was quick to replace my meal and offer to comp the meal, but you lose your appetite pretty quickly after biting into r2d2.   After all you know what they say: Ruin my breakfast once, shame on you. Bite into metal twice, expect to receive my dentist bill.  I was bummed that I didn't end up loving this place after hearing great things about it, but I'm guessing that the other reviewers weren't the lucky recipients of tool box bits.

Not terribly big.  But I loved the fact that they had seating at the bar.   Service:  Really good.  I was served by one of the bartenders right away.  Drink ordered was placed and food ordered taken soon after.  It was easy for to get refills on my drink.  Check came out right away.  No complaints with the service. Food:  First off, their coffee is a frenched pressed brew.  It was impressive and delicious.  There menu had a little of everything (including mexican and traditional breakfast).  I had their meat lover omelette (or something like that) and bagel and cream cheese.  Omelette and potatoes were pretty good.  All of the condiments are on the table including multiple hot sauces.  Bagel was nicely toasted and the cream cheese nicely whipped.   Value:  My meal came out to $20.  The guy forgot to charge me for coffee so that was a nice break.  It would have sucked if I had a larger party and needed to wait in line.  OTherwise decent place for breakfast.",

I ordered the breakfast tacos and my waiter Joseph T let me know it was a great choice. He wasn't lying. These tacos were a great take on the classic breakfast burrito but better. The side of beans that came with were Amazing. My cup of black tea was perfect and twice Joseph T poured my tea for me from the pot left on my table.  Kevin really enjoyed is lox scrabble. The salmon covered the eggs beautifully. They didn't skimp you on the salmon at all. It came with a bagel which made it the perfect combination.",

One thing I was a little upset about was the fact that my husband wanted a small glass on just tomato juice and they could not give it to him BC they did not have it, but they had bloody Mary's weird OK.

When watching your weight because summer is going to peek it's ugly head very soon we had a early dinner but after all that fun etc. my girls and I decided no late night binging so we slept hungry and woke up hungrier.  So we went downstairs because they were raving about this place considering they are always staying at the SLS and eating here, I really trusted their opinion, but even they were so disappointed in the quality of the food! I ordered the buffalo wrap, there was barely any chicken in there the dressing was not even properly dressed just bland bland bland! I tried the Benedict it was bleh nothing really nice to comment about it, the potatoes had zero flavor and were honestly just greasy. BUT the only nice thing I have to say about this restaurant which next time I will say I'll pass on is the Pressed Coffee! It is really fantastic! I would only stop in here to grab a coffee. Food 1-10 was a 2, coffee a 10, and service considering our server was constantly MIA was a 3.   I do not recommend this restaurant.",

If the goal is to meet a calorie quota to continue vegas activities then the choices will meet those demands. It's in the best interest to upgrade the facilities and retain all the customers for a hungry buffett session thereby retain the return of investment at breaknecking pace.

We decided to dine here because they offered both.  The restuarant was located downstairs in our hotel (SLS Hotel) so it was convenient for us, another reason we wanted to dine here.  We walked up to the hostess and was seated immediately.  Our server introduced himself and then handed us menus and waters.  The interior was very spacious and has unique decor.  I ordered Dim Sum and Sweet & Sour Soup.  The Siu Mai was very tasty - full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  The meat was tender and juicy.  The Har Gow was ok, the wrapper was soft at the beginning of the meal and then became a little chewy for me.  The meat was good, but I would pass on this dish.  The Sweet & Sour Soup was tasty and had the right amount of flavor - more sour than sweet, but still very good.  However, the mushrooms weren't sliced, so I had giant chunks in my bowl  :\\  After awhile I didn't want to eat anymore because it tasted slimy.  My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito and it looked great.  Two people can definitely share the  burrito!  Service here was pretty good.  We dined around 11:30AM and it was kind of busy.  Staff members were friendly and attentive.  Water cups were refilled constantly.  The tables, chairs, and floors were clean.  I was very happy and satisfied with my first experience here.  I would dine here again, but would try something different next time.",

I had their signature nachos, my wife had Kong Poa Chicken, and my daughter had some Asian noodle dish.  We all loved our our food, the nachos were some of the best I ever had.  It was so good my wife and I went back for breakfast the next morning.  I had a breakfast burrito which was really good, and my wife had the avocado toast which was awesome.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband's burrito was massive and sufficient. It's a good diner. But that's what it is- a diner. So I'm basing my review with that category in mind. 4 stars for solid service and a quick meal, per our request.   I ordered my parfait without granola - and it arrived as requested.

They waited like 15 mins for get served but the waiter didn't show up and they left.  Food here is ok. You really need patience or not really hungry to eat here.

I just knew this was going to be great, everything fell in place how could it not be tasty?   Well, I'll tell you how...I ordered veggie fried rice no egg & my friend ordered chicken fried rice. We waited about 10-15 minutes for our order and once we got it, of course, checked it out. I wish I would've taken a picture, but it literally looked like steamed rice tossed in oil + asparagus & broccoli. Now I should've just asked for a refund, but I was hungry, tired, & optimistic.  I get to my room too ready & let me tell you  what it tasted like: steamed rice tossed in oil + asparagus & broccoli ANNOYED. I had to put a ton of soy sauce & sriracha to make it edible.  On the other hand, my friend took 2 bites of her chicken fried rice & threw it out.  Won't be back & won't reccomend. P.s the rice tossed in oil made my stomach hurt. The reason for the 2 stars? The staff was super nice!",

We ordered the nachos and asked for guac on the side and no jalapenos. It came out with both of those on top. We didn't complain and just ate around it. I didn't prefer the cheese sauce on them, I would've just preferred regular cheese as it just made them more soggy. They were pretty good and not a ridiculous portion where we couldn't finish them.

If I didn't finish working 12 hours on my feet I would have stopped right there, but I'm starving so I quickly get the contents out of the bag and get it as far away from me as possible. I take a bite, and guess what, there is bacon. It was extremely disappointing for them to mess up my order like this, so I call back to inform them. The girl on the phone says they can either bring up a new one, or take it off my bill. At this point, I rather just go somewhere else and throw this in the trash, so I tell them to take it off my bill, she says okay she will get the manager so they can remove the room charge. Two days later when I go to checkout, surprise they DID NOT remove the charge as I was told!!!!!!! The front desk was useless to help me and I had to fill out a form to \"dispute the charge.\" Why should I have to \"dispute\" anything when it's what I was promised?  Completely unforgivable lack of communication and professionalism in their operation, it is embarrassing.  DO NOT ORDER IN-ROOM DINING WHILE STAYING AT THE SLS HOTEL! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",

After our egg Rolls Joseph recommend the noodles and they were piping hot and delicious. He checked on out table if we needed anything else and refilled our drinks without asking. It's our first time to the sls and I highly recommend. Steve was the other waiter he was great also. Adding to my review: Just had breakfast. It was great! U can tell they use quality ingredients. The omelette was nice and fluffy. The coffee and blood Mary was awesome. The waiters at the counter Ben and Roberto provided great customer service.",

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese-lightly breaded & pan friend chicken breast with garlic toasted kale. He said the chicken was way too thick....and dried. He enjoyed his kale so much better.  I was in the mood for pasta so I ordered the Whole Wheat Penne Primavera-zucchini, onions, roasted tomatoes, broccolini and roasted garlic. I requested to add grill chicken to it but they forgot. -__- oh well. This pasta had absolutely NO TASTE. Without sprinkling a bunch of black peppers and red pepper flakes, I probably wouldn't eat more than 5 bites. Heck, the roasted tomatoes and my garlic bread tasted better than the entire entree!!!!!!!  When you enjoy your sides more than your main entree, there's a problem here.  Also, my boyfriend wanted to order house wines and they didn't even have the main ones available....like chardonnays, merlot, pinot, etc. He wasn't too pleased with that.  Disappointing restaurant. Never tried The Griddle Cafe when it was still here but I'm sure their food tasted better than THIS.",

And so I did--right in the center of the U looking straight into the kitchen.  I ordered the pork carnitas torta.  This is a large sandwich and plan to cut it and eat it in pieces.  If you attempt to pick it up and eat it like a hamburger, you'd better have big hands and a big mouth to match.  It is filled with goodness.  With the carnitas are cotija cheese, jalapeno crema, charro beans, onion, lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  With the sandwich I got fries.  You have a choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries, or fresh fruit.  The sandwich was on a large hamburger style bun, not the oval shaped torta I had expected but that's a minor critique.  It was tasty and messy eating and good eating.  Service was very good.  As soon as I sat down, a server was there to take a drink order and someone arrived with a menu and asked for a drink order.  Eddie was my main server and he was efficient and friendly.  Northside Cafe's a good place to stop for lunch and I'll have to stop by for dinner some evening.",

Almost random selections of food.  I opted for the Chinese ... The eggplant vegetable dish had a decent sauce.  You would think they'd include rice and chopsticks but nope.    It's on the strip and in the hotel so it's priced higher than anyone should pay.  If this was off strip and lower price ... And had a more streamlined selection and included rice with its Chinese dishes and chopsticks and well ... I'm sure I can think of lots of other things.  It would be much better.  With so many special places on the strip, you are better off going somewhere else (or even a chain if you want to be more price conscious)",

All you need is an SLS Code Card and a Nevada ID. Nachos, northside burger and lemon drops were ordered which totaled to about $40, but would have been less if we weren't alcoholics. All in all worth the price for the local menu and will certainly try it again, if not for the taste, at least for the price.",

    "text": "Welcome to Northside Cafe and Chinese Kitchen!  It's a Chinese restaurant by night, but early mornings, it's an American style cafe/diner with tasty breakfast options.  We stopped in on a couple of occasions and had good food and decent service....at Vegas prices of course. (Breakfast is served all day, e'ry day!)  They have a $25 breakfast buffet, but we chose to order from the menu on each visit.  The Chilaquiles Verdes is $16 and includes two fried eggs (cooked to your style), tortillas, chorizo, cotija cheese and pico de gallo.  It's a very large and filling portion, but a little different than the chilaquiles style I'm used to.  Instead of tortilla strips, it was served on tortilla CHIPS.  Nothing wrong with that, just a bit different and more difficult to eat with a knife and fork.  It was kind of like trying to eat nachos with a knife and fork.  There was too much chorizo in it for me, so it made it pretty salty.  Also, not enough of the verde hot sauce, or pico de gallo, and I wish it was made a little spicier than it was.  The Two Egg Breakfast ($16) is typical breakfast diner food.  Includes two eggs cooked as you like, with choice of bacon, pork, or chicken sausage. Also includes hashbrowns and toast.  No complaints with this order.  Grilled Cheese & Roasted Tomato Soup ($13) - the grilled cheese sandwich was of ordinary size, but included swiss, cheddar, and provolone cheese on grilled sourdough bread.  I'm not usually a fan of tomato soup, but hey, my receipt shows that it was around 4:30 am, so maybe my judgement was clouded, LOL.  Regardless of my hazy state, I was happy with what I can remember about my meal.  The tomato soup was very rich and creamy.  The Breakfast Burrito ($15) was a very decent size and was loaded down with a smorgasbord of offerings.  It was stuffed with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, green chiles, sour cream, TASTY guacamole, salsa verde, and pico de gallo. As far as quantity goes, this is probably the best bang for the buck at this joint.  They have awesome orange juice and raspberry mimosas too.  The restaurant is very cold, so bring a blanket or a jacket!",

Lots of sauce, good eggs, and chips didn't get too soggy.   We ventured into the \"Chinese\" cafe and it was extraordinarily average. Our chicken pan fried noodles were okay. This was hangover Chinese food and it did the job but... Panda Express is better. Noodles were super greasy and had huge chunks of unseasoned chicken. The Char Siu Steamed Pork Buns were actually pretty good, granted hard to screw up.   Overall, exactly what you'd expect. Wait was quick around 10:30 on a Saturday.",

We were stuffed and ready to leave, but Juan insisted on trying the molten chocolate cake and thank god he sold us on that it was the perfect end to a meal. Overall Northside cafe is my go to restaurant for a hearty meal and friendly faces. Thank you Juan!",

The cost is a little bit higher than it should be but not as much of a rip off as others.   In the Sahara there's many dining options. It's located just off the casino floor. This is on the southern end by the Mexican restaurant. It's a little hard to find. They put a sign out in front when they're open, which helps. Prices kind of suck here, but they do give you a good amount. They unfortunately charge extra for rice so for that they suck. A good thing is that they're always open. So far the only thing I've had is the tofu. It's $12 for a regular portion. This doesn't include any rice. It does taste pretty good. This isn't like other casino restaurants that charge a lot and you get shit.   It seems to be one of the better dining options if you're staying in the Sahara. If you're not you're still welcome to come. The breakfast menu is served all day if you would rather have that.",

Worst thing is I ordered Steak and Eggs, the meat is not fresh and rotted/smelly. I even had my friends tried it before we spoke to server, the server keeps insisting their meat is fresh and delivered every time. She said it was because of the meat was marinated, that's why it tastes like this. My friends and I are good enough to differentiate the rotten meat. Who gonna marinated to smell and taste rotted meat. It was definitely not seasoning. The server have her manager came talk to us, the manager asked if we want the new one or something else. I decided not to order anything else. We also found a hair on Waffle plate, everyone feels like to throw up after. We will not go back to this restaurant.  #Not recommended",

I literally cleaned my plate and could have easily had another. There were a lot of onions so keep that in mind lol.    The service was great. Waters refilled regularly, checked in on us, very patient with us. The restaurant was clean and aesthetically pleasing. It was pretty empty, but this casino/hotel is located a bit off the strip so that was expected.   Everyone at the table was happy with their selections. I would definitely go back to this place.

Therefore service was super slow. Took a long time for us to be acknowledged and to order.   We ordered nachos to share and asked for jalapenos and guacamole on the side. That didn't happen as both items came on top. When you're drunk and hungry it's not worth complaining about but the requests were simple and we're not honored.   Maybe other menu items are better? Maybe coming at a decent hour of the day or night is better? Who knows.",

For this Vegas trip I stayed at the SLS and being that it was a bit far from the strip, we had to work with what we had. Northside is on the first floor of the SLS. We went in not expecting so much but the menu was LENGTHY! Burgers, Sandwiches, Fried Rice, Pho...What?   The menu was really diverse! the first time I came here I went with the Pho which was a bit too greasy for my taste but on a freezing January evening in Vegas, this definitely hit the spot! Oliver, the waiter that evening was so helpful and welcoming! He helped me make a decision on my meal that evening and he also knew how to describe a lot of the menu items precisely!   Next morning, we were starving so off to Northside we went. Let me tell you, this was one of the best yogurt parfaits I've had! The yogurt was creamy and smooth and not too sour being that it was greek.  I wasn't so hungry so I got the oatmeal with a side of potatoes and turkey sausage...delicious. Our server that morning was great but unfortunately, I forgot his name! He was very accommodating to my order. They brought my sides before the oatmeal and he made sure I had warm potatoes and sausage so he got me a fresh plate of those.   If I ever venture off the strip or stay at the SLS again, I definitely won't mind coming here throughout my trip!",

The dumplings weren't numerous, but they were a great size, and very tasty.  Meaty and flavorful!  Some of the more traditional dim sum condiments would have been nice, but I didn't ask.  I was sleepy.  2) The next morning, I ate there with friends before we got our day started.  This time, the restaurant was packed, so service was slow.  Northside is clearly THE main casual full-service restaurant at SLS, and they delivered a solid breakfast.  The bacon was fantastic.  The coolest thing about this place is that in addition to the fairly diverse menu, it has a really nice selection of Chinese dishes.  From what I experienced, they did everything well.  It's unfortunately dark inside, which I don't like during breakfast/lunch hours, but an affordable go-to in SLS that you won't regret.",

We had to ask very specific questions to get any answers. She would not help us with questions about drinks - instead, she referred us to the small drink menu at the back of the table which listed 6-7 specialty drinks only. We ordered water. Food was mostly cold (and it came out pretty fast, which was weird) and mostly bland. Jalepenos were possibly the hottest i've ever tasted, not in a good way. A second wait person took over saying our waitress was \"overwhelmed.\"  Overall not a nightmare experience but well below what we would expect from a Strip hotel restaurant.  Getting the tab took 15 mins.",

    "text": "I would come back here strictly for the COFFEE! If based soley on the food, It would probably only get 2 stars.   THE FOOD: I will start with the coffee. Freshly ground beans in a french press. When I started working full time, I started drinking coffee to get through the day. I didn't like it much but it kept me up... Then I started having REAL coffee... not folgers, and actually really enjoy the flavor. The coffee they make here is GREAT. They only serve french press and they offer 2 sizes. The regular is enough for 2 people (about 3 cups). I did not order the large but it seems like a pretty hefty amount. So, to eat i ordered a breakfast burrito, which i was somewhat disappointed with. It was large and filling but not very flavorful, and the guacomole, sourcream, and pico de gallo was on top of the burrito... I don't know about most people but I like my ingredients on the inside. The potatoes, which at least were inside, were too big. They might has well have wrapped a baked potato in a tortilla. Call me spoiled from Southern California, but It should not take multiple bites to finish one cube of potato in a breakfast burrito. I don't ask for a burger with the ketchup on top of the bun. My girlfriend ordered a Reuben which was definitely better. Go with that.  THE PRICE: A moderate price for Vegas. $14 for the breakfast burrito and $14 for the Reuben. The coffee was $5 which is pricey, but remember you get about 3 cups worth, so it isn't too bad.   THE VIBE: The Northside Cafe is located in the SLS hotel near the pool, with a pretty casual setting, tables, and bar seating. The staff i encountered was pretty friendly. It is open 24 hours and perfect for a hungover morning, a meal after a dip in the pool, or a late night snack coming back from the clubs.   OVERALL: The food isn't bad, but if you are a coffee person staying at the SLS Hotel and Casino or even at a nearby hotel trying to get a morning \"pick me up\", swing by the bar in the back of the Northside cafe and take a french press to go. You're day will go a lot smoother.",

I looked at the menu posted outside the restaurant and found something I could eat (I'm on a restricted diet). I walked in, was seated and then handed an abbreviated menu. The selection I wanted wasn't served until 6 am. I ordered a salad after inquiring about another menu item. The salad was decent and I waited for my bill. My bill came out to $16.11 and I gave the waiter a $20. He comes back with $3 change. Because I needed a couple of nickles for something I needed to do later, I asked him about my missing $0.89. He went off to go find change and tossed $0.85 in the bill folder on the table. I grabbed a couple nickles and left him a $3.79 tip even though the service was average at best. All the waiters didn't seem overly friendly to any of the 6 or 7 groups of patrons in the restaurant.  If I ever stay at the hotel I did, I will make sure I plan better for early morning food needs than go back to the Northside Cafe.

The manager on duty even came over to make sure everything was better with the dinner he received after that. They were both very apologetic.  We have always had good service, one of our favorite waiters are no longer there but we have had a couple after that we really like. The place can get pretty busy at times especially at dinner time, but the wait is not usually that long.  We really like that they are open 24 hrs, some nights when your playing the machines time passes by so fast it is hard to find a place open.  We have tried a few of their desserts and they are very good too! Worth checking out when you want some good food!",

We just so happened to dine here on National Margarita Day so we took advantage of free margaritas with our meal (they were delicious). Our server was pretty awesome- very attentive and outgoing. The food was quite good and we were all satisfied. Although we did not have the bloody marys, I am dying to try it next time because everyone's looked so good! This is one of the few times where I had almost all of the meals of my trip at the hotel I was staying at. Good selection SLS!",

The food came out super fast, the waitress was awesome (she started by putting on my boyfriend's sunglasses and cracking a joke) and the Bloody Marys are adorned with a whole stalk of celery and a huge slice of thick cut bacon... Which is never a bad thing. :)  I played it safe and got the two egg breakfast with perfectly cooked over easy eggs, pork sausage, and breakfast potatoes. However my friend got the chilequiles and it was huge spicy and awesome!   The best part is it was all pretty affordable and due simply to the fast and friendly service, ill definitely go back!",

We never saw or server from the time out dinner was delivered until he asked about a coupon before running of to get the check. Never came back to check if the food was good or to check our drinks.

The only negative was that rice was not included so ordered it on the side.  Not surprised -- another way to force you to pay more for your meal.  Eggs Benedict was awesome, and the sauce was perfect, served with a side of roasted potatoes.  French toast was overpriced, $10 for 2 average bread slices of French toast, nothing else on the plate. However it did taste good.  They serve both American and Chinese food here and do it pretty well.  Prices on the high side, but yes, it is Vegas.  It is just inside the entrance to the SLS hotel and casino.",

And, the service from Joseph and Lola are outstanding.  Very friendly, and management should give them recognition.  Keep employees happy, and customers will reap the rewards from pleasant staff.    ALSO:  The Northside burger OUT RANKS burgers from Umami (main burger joint in SLS).  Don't get me wrong, Umami is good, but I'm sorry Umami, your fries do not measure up to the fries at Northside.  Same with your burgers.  Good, but not as good as the Northside burger.  If you order the Northside burger, I recommend choosing the burger, not chicken.",

It open up my appetite to have a philly steak, the steak was on the perfect seasoned, cooked on the perfect medium rare just how i asked for, and wasnt  too heavy like other places i have tried...  Overall, thought the price for what we all got was good, and the ambiance was great! My waiter was Juan M, he was very polite and attentive through out our whole experience in Northside Cafe, even though he was busy with other things we really felt his whole attention to our table, I will defiantly come back and try something new now that I know that what i had was great delicious food!

My contingent only stayed at SLS because a year ago we were trying the previous restaurant that was banging heads in the local culinary landscape at the Hash House a Gogo. We were disappointed when half way through 2015 we found out they had folded up their tent and the SLS has put in some \"version\" of a breakfast place.   YOU win! Ok, I'm not concerned that the cuttsie names and pancakes the size of a Donk wheel are gone, what we were all glad for, is that the food is delicious, unique \"enough\", fast and the staff is super friendly. Not one breakfast over our tradeshow was spent out of the hotel.   Thanks for making it great. Already booked rooms for tradeshows into 2017. Hopefully, it will still be breakfast then too... and the French Press, winner!!!",

My personal favorite were the hazelnut (Nutella) French toast! Their French pressed coffee was great. We tried so many different things and were extremely happy! The chorizo burrito is great as well! The yogurt parfait was amazing too! The only thing that wasn't the best were the beans they used on the nachos. They called them \"charro beans\" and being Mexican you expect real charro beans. Instead they were literally chilly beans. But other than that great service as well. I just went back to Vegas mid July, I didn't stay at the SLS but we sure came here to eat!  Oh and if you're staying at the SLS the room service is the exact same menu with about $2 added to every item so just go down stairs and eat :)",

The food is really good I'm not going to lie, I had the chocolate French toast and egg breakfast. But let me tell you why I'm NEVER going back! First of all, the service was terrible!! When we first got here, we waited 20 MINUTES and no one acknowledged us, asked us for water, NOTHING! We just sat there trying to get servers attention looking stupid. And it was not busy AT ALL let me tell you, but all the servers were sitting around watching the basketball game not doing anything so we got up and walked out. We ended up going back though because my boyfriend had work in about 1 1/2 hour and we really wanted to have breakfast. So we go to the manager and he gets us a seat again, THEN FINALLY a server comes to us. First of all, there was never a drink menu given to us. I still don't even know what they have to drink there. I tried asking my server bout coffees bc I wanted one but he was just very short and gave me one coffee option. So I said sure I'll take two (trying to be positive and make the best of the situation). So anyways I'm still asking about drinks and he interrupts me and just says \"Do you want to get your foo order in?\" So I'm like fine and we order. MIND YOU I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS SERVERS NAME IS! My server never introduced himself, nothing. He did bring us water though. So he brings our food and that was it. We never saw our server again. Didn't ask how we were, he refilled our water once and that's it. So we ate and enjoyed each other's company, then he took another 20 minutes to get us our bill. Honestly $50 for bs. It was shitty service and I never got my damn coffee either! I give two stars bc the food was good but not worth the money nor the service. I would NEVER EVER go back to this place.",

The best thing it has going for it is that it's open more frequently than the other eating options at SLS. It gets very crowded at breakfast and the staff just can't keep up.  Its hard to find anything vegan on the menu, so I had the roasted veggie wrap. The first time I had it, it was good, but the second time it was swimming in oil.   It will do when you don't want to leave the hotel, but I certainly wouldn'd go out of my way to eat there.",

Opportunity #2: Take away Turkey Club Sandwich around the lunch hour...did not impress, bland.  Opportunity #3: Late night group meal, combo of breakfast & dinner items. Brought out Buttermilk Pancakes when Blueberry Pancakes were ordered. Speaking of the Blueberry Pancakes, the menu noted inclusion of Blueberry Whipped Cream which ultimately ended up being a large dollop of whipped cream with a handful of blueberries sprinkled on top. Really? Standard eggs, bacon, toast order had the most issues which resulted in sending back the order completely and guest having to share food with others at the table. Eggs & bacon arrived first and 10 minutes later the toast finally arrived only to be warmed bread. The response for reason why toast didn't arrive with the rest of the meal was \"it's made on a conveyor belt\".  Take two with the toast attempt was the exact same result which by then the eggs and bacon are cold so entire meal was sent back. While the order was removed from the bill, we did receive mean eyes from the manager.  If you like pickles, this is the place to go. However, if you like anything else including service you may want to pass.  Considering the attention to detail in and around the SLS Las Vegas, Northside Cafe did not rise to the occasion to continue the high standard of excellence.",

I get that it's Vegas but talk about nickel and diming. Also ordered some dumplings and chicken tenders. The orange chicken was pretty legit, hot, flavorful and tasted good. 4/5 stars. The tenders were also good, no messing those up. The dumplings however, were absolutely terrible and inedible. They were pork and shrimp dumpling and smelled like rotten seafood. The smell penetrated the container and smelled horrendous, -2/5.   The service was questionable. I needed an extra silverware set, and asked for one. The guy at the counter let me know what he didn't have any more sets to give. I told him I was staying at the hotel and needed one. He says again, \"I really don't have any more\" mind you, I'm STARING at a cup filled with regular non-disposable silverware. I finally ask for the in house flatware and he grudgingly gives it to me. Next time, try to problem solve instead of telling a customer you don't have a necessary item to eat the food they just ordered.   Breakfast: this was a more change. We were promptly seated with a kind waitress and ordered. Got the whole hog omelette and  the breakfast burrito. Both came out hot and fresh, and tasted absolutely delicious. The serving sizes were plentiful, and the service was great. 5/5.",

Noodles tough.  Fruit bowl is hard cubes of cantaloupe, etc.  French fries look, taste like previously frozen.  This is Vegas, there are too many good choices to settle for Northside.",

I was looking for good Chinese dim sum, like the picture outside the building. What we got was a highly confused menu- part Mexican, part Chinese; at least that's what the names of the food implied. What we actually got was oily yuck. If one has dry skin, then one visit here and that person will be sweating oil for days upon days. The Baja taco, the won tons, and the tortilla chips had all been fried together and equally, had no flavor. The cook forgot to drain the oil, but certainly remembered the salt. Hint: a little salt is good, a container makes the food inedible. Yet I paid. I paid the inefficient server because we hadn't sent it back. I tipped 10% for never having been asked anything about the meal, but being continuously provided copious amounts of weak ice tea. Don't eat here. Unless you wish to spend quality Vegas time in the nearest Restroom.",

He really enjoyed the blueberry version; the blueberry whipped cream on top was a nice touch. I'm not into sugar for breakfast and couldn't stomach more than a few bites.  But nachos for breakfast? Now you're speaking my language! The Chilaquiles Verdes dish is basically nachos, but they throw on a couple of fried eggs so you can pretend to fit in with your breakfast-loving pals (they're all heathens). Saucy, spicy, and crunchy, it's a party in your mouth- and one I'd get again.  Service was pretty solid and I'm glad to see they still have the french press coffee.

    "text": "Went here on Social Sunday which something that SLS features every sunday. Different restaurants take turns giving locals 50 percent off pretty much the entire menu. This alone is what attracted me to this establishment.  Yes, I know they used to be Griddle Cafe (which I am sorry for not doing a review even though I have visited twice already), so I had mixed expectations. Well, im here to tell you that the generous portions are no more. :(  My wifey ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes ($12.95) with a Latte ($3.75) and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak ($14.95).  Like before, I have ordered the Golden Ticket when it was GC. It was 3 huge pancakes about 12 inches in diameter. (That's what SHE said). For these guys, it was more like 6 inches. Basically, same price but half the size. The Red Velvet pancakes themselves were pretty good. Fluffy with some sweetness to it. Topped off with a cream cheese frosting and chocolate shavings. The latte was decent.  The Philly Cheesesteak was a pretty good size. Has thinly sliced strips of grilled sirloin mixed with grilled onions and melted provolone cheese. It came with a side so I chose sweet potato fries which were very good. Puts regular fries to shame.  Service was good. Kailena was our server and did not disappoint. Took our orders and brought our food out in a timely manner. Even refills on our waters were done without asking for it.  In closing, everything was on point. I only spent $17.10 because of the 50 percent discount plus 5 bucks tip. When I say on point I mean the price I paid was worth it. Under normal circumstances I would not come back to pay the marked up prices for what you get. The locals discount is what will bring me back because what you can get here is what you can probably get for half that at some other restaurants. It's good to be a local. Oh and they are open 24 hours.  Yelp 2015 review #20 518 overall",

    "text": "Given it's self-proclaimed reputation as the \"foodie\" hotel on the (northernmost reaches of the) Strip, the food options at SLS weren't that spectacular.  Aside from several chains, there were few really compelling options.  Thus, my friends and I ended up at Northside Cafe, which served somewhat affordable (~$10-$20) American fare in a casual environment.    The restaurant had an extensive breakfast menu that continued to be served through lunch, and had an array of lunch items ranging from tacos and wraps to burgers and sandwiches.  The staff was friendly, but didn't offer substantive answers regarding questions about their food.  Since I have food allergies, I would have liked the staff to actually take the initiative to ask the kitchen about ingredients if they weren't entirely sure about the contents of one of my selections.  Nevertheless, I was generally satisfied with what I ordered:  Barbacoa Tacos: Overall, I would highly recommend the barbacoa tacos.  After I had ordered, the waitress mentioned that this was one of their most popular items, and it was clear why.  The meat was delicious, tender, and juicy.  If you've had barbacoa at Chipotle, then I would say that this was much more flavorful.  On top of the barbacoa, were decent portions of salsa, guacamole, and cilantro.  The side dish featured charro beans, which had a mixture of cheese, meat, and beans.  I didn't sample this dish since I'm allergic to dairy products, but my friend who sampled it gave it the thumbs up.  The one drawback to this dish was the fact that you only received two tacos for $12-13.  While the tacos were filling, I would have felt more comfortable paying that price if I had received at least one more taco.  If you're staying at SLS and want something somewhat more affordable than some of the higher end fare, Northside Cafe definitely fits the bill.  But, keep in mind that the food is pretty typical of what you could find elsewhere.",

We were statying at SLS and I was given a $50 food & beverage credit so we decided to use it at Northside.   We waited about 5 mins to be seated as they literally have a velvet rope for the line to be seated. The hostess was nice and so was our server. She checked in on us often. The only misstep would be she forgot to bring us the strawberry jam and I had to remind her... I opted for the ham & eggs. It was a big slice of bone-in ham and I went with scrambled eggs. It comes with breakfast potatoes which would be better if they crisped them up a little bit. The ham was great and filling. Good smoky flavor and thick cut to satisfy the hungriest carnivore. The eggs were just ok. Needed salt & ketchup as usual. You also get a choice of toast and I went with sourdough. White bread is not an option. I got a side of bacon on the side and that was good.  Northside Cafe is a decent option for breakfast/lunch inside the SLS. It's a scaled down diner or family restaurant. It's too bad they didnt stay The Griddle because those pancakes were legendary... Service was good. Food was ok.",

We live across the street, so we've eaten here twice out of sheer convenience. The first time we came it was late at night and this place has a \"seat yourself\" setup. The servers here are just not very attentive. Do not eat here if you are ever in a hurry. Tonight we went in, and it's a Saturday night. There were about 10 tables. Took a bit of time for some waters, then a lady took our order. After that, she left for her shift so my partner and I entered the land of, \"Who the f*ck does this table belong to?\" Eventually, the food runner saw all our food hanging out under the heat lamps and brought it to us. My three course dinner became two courses at the same time, and I was so angry that I left without bothering to eat the third (not that it was ever delivered). My partner's appetizer and entree also came out all at once, despite our previously departed server initially asking if we wanted the app first. No one checked on us after that. We sat there so long we essentially became a part of the decor. I work in the service industry and I used to be a server myself -- I am REALLY bad at being rude but I am also really sensitive to poor service. This experience made me so angry. There were two other servers on duty and two bussers. It took two attempts, but my partner flagged down a busser for a water refill, after that I began a social experiment where I set a timer to see how long we went being straight up ignored by the rest of the staff, who repeatedly checked on the other tables around us. I guess my partner got tired of waiting because he flagged down a different busser for our check, explained we had been ignored for about an hour, and he went to get the manager on duty. Three employees looked super confused when he pulled up our check on their screen. The manager came to our table, his attitude seemed less than apologetic face to face, but he said he would comp us 25% of our check and gave me a ticket for a free dessert. The price ended up at an amount WAY less than what we actually ate, so I don't think they actually had a record of our meal? I'm not an entitled princess, so I left a 20% tip anyway. I don't want to go back, but my partner is into the idea of a free dessert at a later date so I guess we'll see who wins the next argument...",

It wasn't very busy, but being the only decent priced breakfast place, it was our only option since we were staying at SLS. A girl came and took our drink orders, that was fine. Then this guy server took over. It just went downhill. 3 of us got out orders in decent time but the other 3 didn't get our food for another 15 mins. We ordered 2 pots of coffee with 4 cups. They brought 3 and we had to ask 3 times to bring the 4th. Then, after all the food had arrived and we were eating, I realized my soup did not come. I asked the server when he finally walked by and he acted like he forgot, but it's coming. Another person at our table had soup and she got it early so obviously he forgot. Then, we got an entree delivered that we did not order. Ok...what was this server doing?? My friend ordered a wrap where you can pick a choice of sides: Fries, sweet potato fries, Etc. pretty standard. She choose sweet potato. Our server however thought she wanted a whole separate side of fries and ordered her a side of sweet potato and her wrap came with regular fries. Why would she want that??? Finally, after hunting him down for the bill, there were 3 things wrong!!! Omg! Banana pancakes, we did not order. 2 flatbreads (which we did order, but 1 did not ever arrive!), side of sweet potato fries ($5.95!) and an 20% added gratuity. Ohhh... so THATS why the service sucked!! I spoke with the manager about the many errors and she didn't really care because he brought back the bill and only took the sweet potato fries off and not the other 2 things that we didn't get. I would definitely go somewhere else next time. There were a lot of people working and the place was less than half full. Not sure why they kept dropping the ball but our server was terrible. He never apologized because we barely even saw him. Fail.",

The bacon and eggs were good, not spectacular but good.  Service was very good.  Ishmael our server was fantastic.  Just definitely not worth the price.  $16 for 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs on a mid-small plate that is just above average diner fare... $13 for 3 pancakes no sides?  They both better be worth it for that price, and instead all they did was make me miss 100 small town diners that do it twice as good at half the price.  That's why it's 2 stars.",

Still stuffed. Got to give some props to the staff there, since I feel like they went out of their way to make my experience better. Vicki, the hostess.

    "text": "How is it that a notoriously cheap curmudgeon such as myself can give four stars to typically over-priced hotel coffee shop? Because it's pretty frickin' good, that's why!   I will state my objections and get them out of the way first: It is small, crowded, and noisy. Booths would fit four normal-sized adults (which describes no one in my family), and other than that, they have only tables for 2, so don't go with a crowd. A great deal of the noise is due to the fact that is seems to be perpetually busy in here, which I guess is a good sign, although it also means there's a line, which one normally only encounters at a buffet.  I also wasn't crazy about the decor - the ubiquitous brick and dark industrial gray that seems to be the signature color of hipsters everywhere, and the too-loud background music did nothing for me, but maybe this was the ambience they were going for.   But now that I have finished complaining that it's not Denny's, let me tell you the good part: it's not Denny's! The wait staff is very prompt, friendly, and noticeably young. I pointed this out to the Anaconda, and we agreed that it's a definite contrast to your usual Las Vegas coffee shop wait staff where at least a couple of the employees have been there since sage brush was growing in the parking lot.  But the best thing is, as it should be, the food. What a surpise! The Eggs Benedict  ($14) were great- perfectly cooked, runny yolks, smokey bacon (or ham, who cares?), nice tender potatoes, and a really great Hollandaise; rich and lemony and not from a mix. The Whole Hog omelette  ($14) was so good, the Anaconda wanted to get one again the next day, but I wouldn't let him because I wanted to try the caramelized banana pancakes, so he ordered those and I had steak and eggs. For $18, I was prepared to be picky since you can get a decent special for $4 around town, but this steak was tender and juicy and the bread was thick sliced and tasted homemade. It was even good when it got a little cold because I was busy battling the Anaconda over those pancakes.  Normally, I am not a fan, because I find them heavy and akin to trying to eat a blanket. These were more like pillows. Light and tender and airy and topped with caramelized bananas and optional crunchy streusel topping. Yum. And in case that's not sweet enough for you (it wasn't), the accompanying bottle of maple syrup will put it over the top. Wash it down with a shared pot of French pressed coffee, and the noisy crowd will disappear around in a euphoric haze.",

It takes about 8 minutes before the time you sit down to the time you get your water, that's regardless of whether they sit you in the AM with a hostess or you seat yourself at night. Then about 10-15 mins for someone to come and take your order.  They'll get the one star for the good food. But the services definitely takes away 4 stars.... I've tried this place 3 times now trying to give it another chance, but obviously this is systemic. If you're in a hurry or have things to do, DO NOT even think about this place.",

We had the Chinese Shiitake Mushrooms and Snow Peas with Tofu and the Breakfast Burrito. Both delicious! We would order both again. The Ice Tea was FRESH at 11pm! Delicious!  Great first experience!

The waitress acted as if it was ketchup....... disgusting. Being 2:30 am I decided to brush that off and order food anyhow. We got popcorn shrimp and the club. My fiance decided on a Cucumber Margarita which sounded delicious. The waitress returned 5 minutes later to tell us they ran out of cucumber....... I mean really? She then settled for a Strawberry Margarita. Ten minutes later our food arrived. The popcorn shrimp where falling apart on a bed of stale popcorn. Worth the price....... I don't think so. The club was ok to say the least. Twenty minutes later the Margarita arrived looking more like a Bloody Mary. One taste out of this beverage turned stomachs. Being a Bartender myself, I take pride in my drinks but this was something else. The over pour of spirit was terrible. The strawberry syrup that was used was very sad. Half down one side of the glass was a sugary substance that our waitresses hands where all over. Presentation was a zero and taste was in the negatives! Tasted like it came out of a warm slurpy machine in a Third World 7-11. Terrible! It was a sad example of why some Hotels aren't what they are cracked up to be. I would've like to talk to my waitress but she dropped the check and disappeared. I will never eat here again. The lack of respect for your customers especially the ones that live here is ridiculous.",

Not one of those huge steaks that overwhelms you, but just the right size.  It was perfectly cooked, tender and very flavorful. Simple but excellent. The fries were freshly cooked and served hot. Very tasty. The mixed green salad was also great. A generous portion of spring mixed lettuce served with carrots, tomatoes, goat cheese crumbles and just the right amount of dressing -- a nice red wine vinaigrette.  For dessert, I had a piece of warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream. It seemed homemade and tasted like Grandma had just finished baking it.  The bill for all this and a beer was surprisingly reasonable -- under $45 -- and the service was great.  This is an attractive restaurant with the feel of an upscale diner within the new SLS Las Vegas Hotel.  The overall environment is outstanding.  I can't wait to go back to the Northside Cafe.  The menu had plenty of other appealing choices and I want to sample them all.",

We sat at a table and 5 minutes later the booth was cleaned and we moved over to it. We both ordered the Three Course Dinner (salad, fettuccine with chicken, and a sundae). We waited about 25 minutes and the waiter brought the salad and the entree without chicken. Wish they would have come separate and correctly. We asked for chicken and soon got it. We then asked for our deserts and the real wait happened, 20 minutes later we got our delicious ice cream. Look the food is amazing... the service leaves a lot to be desired.",

Our original plan was to try KU Noodle, but they weren't open for lunch, so we looked  at the Northside Cafe Menu and decided to go with it.  Our Server, Wesley was there to greet us almost as soon as we sat down and was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. We started with The Shrimp Cocktail. A solid version of a Vegas classic. Six large, plump, sweet shrimp curled over a glass full of spicy cocktail sauce.  After  our earlier Vegas Taco Fiasco at Pink Taco, I had to try Northside's Baja Fish Taco's.  Spiced, Seared Mahi-Mahi, Pickled Slaw, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro and Sour Cream restored my faith in Vegas Taco possibilities. Flavorful and moist, I loved every bite! Diane had the Pork Carnitas Torta with Cotija Cheese, Charro Beans, Jalapeno Crema, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and Avocado. She loved it so much I only got one little taste of the meat. What I had was rich and spicy.  Since this was a celebratory trip for us, we had several drinks. Diane's Spiked Lemonade was Sweet, Summery and packed quite a punch! After two she was feeling a little buzzed. I started with an excellent Peach Bellini and followed that up with my favorite drink of the trip. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name, but it was a play on a Mudslide.  Northside Cafe is rarity in Vegas. A high quality, enjoyable 24 hour Casino Diner. I can't wait to go back!",

Experience yesterday did not enable me to unfortunately.   I came to redeem a food offer id received and went for what i had hoped to be a quick and smooth business lunch, which did not turn out to be the case.   First: fries came out cold - but i kept eating them because thats what i do... and i was mad at myself for it.   Second: I understand that not every place can cook a burger to order, but just don't ask how i want it if you're clearly not going to attempt to do it that way. I ordered mine medium rare and it came out put-it-on-the-grill-and-go-take-your-dog-for-a-walk-and-call-your-grandma well done.  Again, not a huge deal if that's what i'm expecting... but i can get something like that at mcy-ds.  Third: service was slow. Took about 10 minutes from getting the bill to leaving, and the place wasn't even crowded. This was particularly annoying because we were in a bit of a hurry.   I know this restaurant just got started (at least in its current branding).... so i'm really leaving this review in hopes they can turn it around. The first few months are crucial so it's not the time to be blowing it. Maybe it's time for a locker room pep talk and get the team back in the game.",

In addition to that, they aren't exactly the nicest people probably because of the aforementioned reasons. It's just a bad recipe for a vicious cycle.  I ordered some sort of a skillet, I think. I said, \"I think,\" because I was half asleep and pretty turnt when the food arrived, but what I know for a fact is that my girlfriend ordered a pesto sandwich with shrimp, but got chicken instead. She said something, but the waitress just sort of brushed it off and gave us an empty apology and went on with her life.

The kale was amazing; just the right amount of saltiness and flavor.

The plus side is they have gigantic portions -- great for when you're hung over, but if you don't want to waste any food, you should probably share an entree with a friend.  On the other hand, the food is quite greasy and generic. The Mexican-inspired entrees lack zing, while the American brunch items feel like something I could get at any average Joe's diner. The prices do reflect the portion size, but they are still a bit high comparing to what you can get outside of the hotel. Guess you are always paying a little extra for the location ;)  Service is a downside. I know it's really busy here during brunch hours, but we hardly ever saw our servers and the turnover rate might have been slow as a result (slow to get our bill etc).

The steak is a little small but very flavorful. The eggs were over easy and just right and I love there breakfast potatoes. Day 2 I had the egg breakfast and again it was made perfectly. The chicken sausage was delicious. I also got a frittata to go which tasted amazing. It has all of the right fillings. The coffee here is very smooth and the ok tastes fresh. Job well done north side. On top of good food the staff is amazing. Day 3 was the breakfast burrito. This burrito should rank number one for burritos in Vegas. I cannot believe I ate all of it. I came back on my 4th day for the steak again and it was better than before. You cannot go wrong with so many items on the menu. I am still scared of the pancakes but so far everything else has been scrumptious.",

    "text": "Update: After my first visit/review, I decided to come back to Northside another few times. In 10 days, I've eaten at the place at least 7 times now. I have updated the rating from 4 stars to 5.   I am in love with the Buffalo chicken wings. I just can't seem to get enough of them. They are perfectly sauce and cooked. I always get two orders now, even if I can't finish it as I know I'll eat it later.  The service has always been good. I've also tried other good such as the Buffalo chicken wrap, cashew chicken, the burger, and their chicken tenders. The wrap was good, the burger was okay, the cashew chicken sucked, and the chicken tenders were amazing. Since they ran out of chicken wings, we asked to get the tenders covered I'm buffalo sauce... And omg they were delicious with their ranch sauce.  I'm in love with this place now :). Especially since it's open till 4 or 5 am! it's perfect for lunch, dinner, or for late night drunk food.  Previous review:  After arriving to the hotel at midnight, not many places were open. The hotel receptionist recommended me and my friend to come here as it  was open late.  Leta say I wasn't disappointed. We ordered wings, dumplings, King pao chicken, noodles, and Margarita.  All of it tasted really good, especially the wings, the King pao chicken and the Margarita. I was pleasently surprised and woild definitely come here again. The wings had delicious buffalo sauce on it with a side of ranch. Both the sauces were made in house and I could easily tell by the viscosity, they weren't as thick as the usual ranch and as thin as the usual buffalo sauce. The kung pao chicken was perfectly cooked with perfect amount of sauce.  Would definitely come back here!",

Too much carrots and celery and not enough chicken. The noodles were too tough, but when you hungry, you ll eat it. Besides hamburgers and breakfast menus salad so on so forth this restaurant also serves it's Chinese menu.

I am of Asian descent and ordered three items: Walnut Shrimp, Pork and Shrimp Shiu Mai, and Hot and Sour soup. Considering its a restaurant inside a hotel, I was assuming two things, overprice and mediocre food. That wasn't the case. Price was fair and food was great. Only downside is maybe the service. The hostess at the front constantly disappears and leaves the front unattended. I waited a little bit before being told to order at the bar since I wanted takeout. The bartender took my order and I did waited a little bit for the food. During my wait, I saw a few other customers had to seat themselves since the hostess wasn't available. Other times, the hostess is just chatting. The servers were great from the short time there.",

I switched out the chorizo on the chilaquiles for Barbados beef instead. There was a tangy salsa verde which was pretty good.  They serve the Chinese menu after 11 am and the items looked good. They even had chow fun which was a surprise. I love that stuff.  Our server was Tina and she was great! Friendly, attentive, and got everything right. Definitely a good spot to try when nursing a hangover, not that I am hungover, but the menu is setup to cover all the hangover food groups in the hangover food pyramid of Booze, sweets, greasy, carbs, breakfast, and tacos.

    "text": "I have to say. For a restaurant with A LOT of options, it really does a pretty good job with quality.  I'm spoiled by the delicious and authentic food in Hollywood so I was a little skeptical of this place.  I've had breakfast here every day, usually ordering the side of egg whites with a side of wheat toast (I ask for no butter) and a coffee (only $11). I don't eat much in the morning so this suited me best.  I tried the bean and rice bowl (no cheese, no meat) and it was delicious. The kung pao chicken isn't bad. It's not authentic, but you get the decent flavor you're asking for.  I also tried the wonton soup. This is why I deducted one star. The wontons were just meatballs wrapped in wonton paper and they were completely bland with absolutely no seasoning or flavor. This grossed me out so I left them alone. The soup was okay and so were the noodles. I just added the chili paste to give it life.  Today I tried their oatmeal for breakfast and it's okay. I don't normally like oatmeal but I'm trying to eat better so that's on me, not them.  I will say the service varies. My first time eating here was mediocre. The rest of the times were very pleasant.  I recommend it for their options if you're in the SLS hotel and hungry. Their prices are a bit high (per normal in Vegas), but they're reasonable compared to other places in this hotel.  I would definitely come back.",

So we decided on giving the Chinese dishes a try even though we were skeptical.  Man were we surprised!  The Yang Chow fried rice had chunky fresh ingredients and the flavor was on point.   My husband raved about the salted pork with century egg congee.  The seafood and tofu claypot was so delicious.  And I'm usually not into claypots!  The tofu was lightly fried and when you bite into it, the inside just melts in your mouth.  Every ingredient in the claypot was cooked just right - tender and tasty.  The next morning we decided to give their breakfast a try.  I was so disappointed by the wait time.  We sat there for probably 40min after placing our order.  The manager apologetically explained how the printer wasn't printing our order back in the kitchen.  Honestly, I didn't understand the hold up but I was appeased by his apology and hospitality.  The blueberry pancake, when it finally showed up, tasted heavenly!  They totally made it up to us.  My husband's French toast was done perfectly as well.  They mixed up our egg orders (he wanted 2 and I only wanted 1) but that was alright.    Overall, I'd recommend this place to weary travelers!  It can get a little crazy when the place gets crowded but the food is worth everything.",

    "text": "The ability to chow down 24/7 while staying at a casino is always a win in my book.   As I was here for a biz trip this became my go-to spot for a late night meal and early morning breakfast.   I liked the option of being able to take a seat at the counter area and eat in solitude while gathering my thoughts, or going over my notes for the day's business dealings.  Really nice staff - very attentive and friendly enough. Decent eats too. Egg white omelet was served up quick and tasty just as I ordered it for a late night dinner. Breakfast served all day and night is so choice. One morning I had the Continental Breakfast with vanilla yogurt parfait, fresh fruit, croissant and some coffee that hit the spot. Another night I had a salmon plate with roasted asparagus, roasted tomatoes & lemon-caper sauce. Was more than satisfied with everything. Plus, you can charge your orders to your room for convenience.    The portions were hearty and considering it's a Vegas hotel the prices were not too expensive.   Also, it's right off the casino floor for a quick exit to the slots and tables for some gambling fun.",

The ambiance is nice, the employees are friendly, and the food is good. I really liked the Orange Chicken and would order it again.  The drawbacks here are in other areas, like the previously mentioned locals issue. Also, the menu posted outside with tons of delicious breakfast items isn't the menu offered in the evening - so if you're ready for pancakes, think again.  During my last visit a guest came in with no shoes on to get alcohol from the bar; no staff said anything about this, which was pretty unsettling. We informed the waiter but he didn't seem very interested.",

    "text": "Surprising Little Spot at SLS. (See what I did there?)   It's not so little but I was surprised by how much I like the food here. Yes it's perhaps pricey but it is inside a Vegas casino. You can't compare these prices to a diner or going directly to chinatown. But then you can use comps here if you gamble so it's a wash. They have a nice variety of food; and it's interesting that they also have Chinese food. I'm pretty sure that it's to cater to Asian clientele who only eat Asian food (like my mother).   I'm sorry that I didn't photograph everything that I've tried here, but I did share all the dishes we have tried between the last two visits. We have had the wings, fried rice, salt and pepper pork chops, wonton noodle soup, huevos rancheros, steak and eggs, and waffles. I wish the quality of the steak was a little better, and the waffles I got had way too much whipped cream. Like I scraped all of it off and it filled up another plate.   If you're already staying at SLS/W, this is definitely a great dining option.",

The kale salad was in a bath of dressing and was light on vegetables. The nachos were covered in movie theater cheese and the toppings were piled on just a few top chips, making them cumbersome to eat. The banana split was mostly whipped cream. Definitely not the best meal at the price point. Try Umami burger instead.",

As we all really enjoyed our meal. 2 of the girls got the grilled cheese with tomato soup. It also has bacon inside it. I wouldn't think it was something however, that I would like. But, they both raved about it so next time I go I'm going to try it as well. This time I tried a divine hot pot! It was fantastic, see the photo! I also tried the hot and sour soup. Just OK, not fabulous. Our other friend got the orange chicken with rice. She said she liked it but she didn't eat it all and she didn't want to take it with her. So I don't think it was her favorite.   Then all in all the food was good . The service was excellent.  We had a wonderful time and enjoyed our food.  Yes, I will eat there again. I love the way it was decorated...50s ,60s diner like . With American food and Chinese.",

The Huevos Rancheros had a hard shell, which was odd, but the asada bowl was good to my taste. Furthermore, the portions were ridiculously huge, which is great because hey, you need more energy to power through the day.  GOOD: no wait, happy servers, decent food, big portions OKAY: location (depending on where you are and staying, as it's off the strip) BAD: odd combo of recipes that sometimes might not work",

There was no wait to be seated in a rather comfortable booth.  Northside has a diverse menu; with breakfast offered all day and dinner options ranging from burgers and salads to pasta or steak as well as options from the chinese kitchen. My chicken fried rice was fine, nothing exceptional, but decent flavor and a good sized portion. My friend had the pan fried noodles and really enjoyed them. Pricing for the items we got were fair for the portion size and on strip location.   Service left a bit to be desired. The one time our waters were refilled my glass was completely overfilled and water spilled all over the table and my lap. The server didn't even notice, I had to take napkins from the empty tables nearby to clean up the mess he made. We were not checked on after receiving our food.   As a local I have very little reason to go to the W, and I would not return to dine at Northside Cafe based on the subpar service and average food.   Yelp Reviews 2018 28/100",

It was probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had in a restaurant! The soup was pretty tasty, too. The 2nd time we ate there was the morning we flew back to Seattle. I ordered a side of fruit and the bagel with cream cheese and my mom ordered the seasonal fruit plate (which was huge and had a large assortment lf fruit). Mine was okay. Can't really go wrong with fruit and a bagel (although the bagel was a Tad over toasted).   The customer service was bad. The waitress we had the first night was semi friendly and at least checked on us and was quick with the check when we were ready to leave but the waiter we had when we had breakfast came across as grumpy. Acted like we were an inconvenience. Finally got him to drop off the check and then waited and waited and waited. Finally gave up and left cash. I feel bad that I wasn't able to leave a tip as I really didn't have much cash on me but we had a plane to catch and not a lot of time to wait until he returned.",

Even though the food was good the pricing was a little high and overall between poor service and a loud room I wouldn't go back.

I actually ordered off the Chinese side this time - beef noodle soup, and I was surprisingly satisfied. The brisket plentiful and pretty tasty. However, for a place that promoted dim sum until 6am, we returned after clubbing, only to be told by our server that he wouldn't recommend that right now because their Chinese chef is not in. While I guess it was nice that he was upfront about that, it was kinda odd, since people usually train others to make stuff and also not like they would be churning out fresh dough or anything (dimsum often already premade)... I ended up getting the burger, which was fine, but service definitely was lacking. Quite a different experience during the day vs. night.",

Service was friendly and attentive.  I kind of miss this place!",

I've eaten here only one other time and we had a few things like breakfast and lunch. Their traditional breakfast is really good. Not quite Bellagio cafe good but look, your at SLS down on Sahara and the strip and for that reason alone it's the best you will get down this far and it's very good. Plus if you add the service which was 5/5 all day long, our waiter was Joseph and he could be working any 5 star restaurant to be honest. I did pay attention to other staff and they were also very in tune with customers and I didn't see anyone that wasn't getting great service. Highly recommend!",

They got me a high chair and put it out of the main traffic. Jim was my server and was very attentive to all his guests. I asked for his opinion between the ham and eggs and steak and eggs, he suggested the ham and eggs, but I ended up getting the steak and eggs. Loved the steak and eggs! Steak was perfectly seasoned! I normally have to get A1 at restaurants, but this time no sauce needed. It was juicy and flavorful. A little charred. It also came with eggs, potatoes, and wheat toast. Eggs and potatoes were average. I like my potatoes a little crispier. But the toast was really good. Great overall!",

Very spacious lots of tables and booths, and it's self seating.  We originally came for the $12 prime rib only to find out it's a deal that only happens on Fridays but we decided to stay and check it out anyways.   They have a weird half and half style where they have a full menu just of Chinese food and a menu just with cafe food ie. burgers and pastas.   Hot & sour soup 3.5/5 - Was actually very surprised it was good, thought it was going to be super Americanized but it's not  We got the 3 course meal for $20 where we chose --   Caesar salad 4/5 - Can't really go wrong with salad but the Parmesan slices were just a little too big of chunks and their dressing is very subtle but not in a bad way  Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken 2/5 - Pretty bland and oily, I prefer my pasta on the softer side as well. The sides of garlic bread were bomb though crispy on the outside but soft in the middle I could've eaten a whole basket !   New York cheesecake 2.5/5 - Your basic cheesecake with strawberry syrup on top with a few fresh strawberries, probably wouldn't order again but it wasn't the worst.",

The restaurant was about 50% full when we were sat and our server was busy leaving us with about a 5 minute greet. She did give us a drive by about 3 minutes into the wait.  I had the blueberry pancakes ($11.95) which were delicious and my wife had the burger ($12.95) which was standard. The timing and communication of the kitchen wasn't that good as the food runner brought out my pancakes at least 5 minutes before my wife's burger arrived.  The menu is large and I would try other items maybe when the locals' discount is offered. Northside is your only option for breakfast and late night at SLS. I would revisit if I were in the hotel and hungry during these times. But it wouldn't be my first option at other times.",

I normally don't get ham & eggs but something was pulling me towards that choice this morning and it was money. The ham wasn't too salty, it was juicy and just really good quality. The eggs, potatoes, English muffin were all good. It's a really good option for breakfast whether you are in a hurry or just looking to hang out.",

My server, a hispanic man, acted like he didnt give two sh*ts about me. Ice water they served tasted funny.  Came in for breakfast as well...had the corned beef hash. Big chunks of undercooked potatoes and chunks of corned beef. Had to cut up the potatoes and flavor it all up with salt, pepper and Tapatio. My server James was nice, but I felt rushed with him, too.  Staff: Be sure to constantly check the condiments at the tables. I was missing pepper and Tobasco. Very basic!  **TIP: Call ahead and make a reservation if you insist on eating here",

We ordered a pretty large order, and it was to go (to our room of course) since there was a huge line outside. The service was extremely slow, as we stood there to pay at the bartender for almost 20 minutes before we were acknowledged.  When we finally got our food, we took it upstairs, and turns out they had a bunch of items wrong. They gave us a chicken wrap instead of a club sandwich (the wrap was extremely salty). They forgot the frosting for our pancakes so we had extremely dry pancakes. The salad was super soggy and droopy, and the burger was falling apart. The tacos were decent. I am sure if we had dined in most of these issues had not occurred, but after waiting to even be acknowledged for so long, I did not even want to bother with going back at that moment.   However, we did call in to let them know, and they did offer to switch out our wrap for the turkey club and give us the frosting & some syrup for the pancakes.   We grabbed the food in a hurry left, and upon checking later in the car... Turns out we had gotten  the turkey club sandwich, and yet again no frosting or syrup for the pancakes. At this point we threw out the pancakes, and the turkey club had old tomatoes, so that ended up in the trash too, and we went elsewhere.   Like I said, it may have been a different experience if we had dined in, but after everything we went through, the quality of the food and service was just awful.",

Manager Eric was amazing.  We inquired about the wait and he made us feel like we were being taken care of. Our waiter,  Jamie, was great too. Did his job.  Seemed very busy with tons of tables and was responsive when we called for him. AND he went out of his way to go to the change machine for us when we needed small bills.   I would come back for the solid meal (and since they're open all day AND serve breakfast all day). I'll just be mindful of the potential wait time.",

I tried the Chinese food pan noddles disgusting rotted beef rubber noddles smelled like leftovers from a fridge that was a month old. Wings were worse than a fast food joint nachos were gross. Honestly replacing this restaurant with a Taco Bell would be better. The food will make you puke! I picked this hotel because it has 24 hr food. I wish I had known the \"24hr food\" was only from this gross place. Ohhh and if you expect in room dining be prepared for a 1-2hr wait for the shitty food from this kitchen.",

Got Farmers salad with chicken - if you want something healthy, that's definitely the choice to go! Minimal salad dressing and the chicken breast was just grilled with barely any seasoning.  - custard steam bun: who steams without wax paper underneath to avoid having the bread stick to their dish? They do. Other than that, they got the custard part right but too much breading - chicken fried rice: not bad at all",

As of this review breakfast is almost done and no pancake. And no one has checked on us in over 20 min.  Upside coffee is good.  Follow up: just before bill came out pancake showed up. Eye rolling. No explanation, nothing just here you go.   There is a family style restaurant not in hotel about 3/4 mile away. Go there.",

It seems like they are still ironing out some new restaurant kinks. The inside of one of my pork buns was still cold, but I didn't really care because I was drunk and starving and at least the pork was already cooked.   The breakfast was yummy. They had all the usual breakfast favorites. There wasn't anything too surprising or original, but I REALLY appreciated the homemade whipped cream on the waffles. The waffle was really crispy which I liked, but there wasn't too much waffle \"meat\" in the center because it was so crispy and airy.",

This place would've gotten 4/5 stars if it wasn't for the wait time. At least when the food finally came out, it wasn't all that bad.

She was patient with our tipsy friends and hinted what would be the best food on the small but varied menu. Her recommendations were awesome! I couldn't believe the piles of food that came out: giant mounds of barbecue laden nachos, perfectly cooked eggs with equally crisp and hot potatoes, and mondo burgers layered with delicious sauteed onions and peppers. Who would think that a cook would take such care and have such creative flair at 0300 in the morning? Great job all around.

    "text": "Went for dinner, 2 of us, what a miserable atmosphere, bad service, drive-thru restaurant type of food. Asked for an iced tea, got the tea, no ice. Dr pepper soda sat there waiting for a refill, had to call the manager to get it. Hamburger bun, cheapest type you can get. Server never showed up at anytime, dirty plates sat there till we left.  Table next to us had ordered many food but had no plates,they went to the bar to get\"em. When exiting server came running saying he forgot to include  the iced tea on the check, we replied what iced tea, it was just tea. Manager then waived charges. Biggest joke \"We love locals\".",

    "text": "Prices about $5 more than chain restaurants selling the same food. Service was poor :(  I had to ask for a refill on my water which was refilled with warm water and no ice. Waiter didn't take the order correctly and gave a member of my party fries instead of fruit. Sandwiches didn't look to bad. Alfredo with chicken tasted fishy. And some of the pasta was undercooked. No Parmesan was offered and when asked sliced Parmesan was brought out. Lol! It was edible but I would not waste my money.",

He was very helpful and attentive. Checked on us regular and had a great attitude. Our food arrived in a timely manner. I ordered the French toast which was quite delectable. Overall my experience at the cafe was very welcoming. I left the restaurant very satisfied.",
