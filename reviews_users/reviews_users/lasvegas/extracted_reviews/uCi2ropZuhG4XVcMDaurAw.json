I had the curry chicken salad wrap with a side salad.  The side salad was super simple and delicious with the balsamic vinaigrette.  The curry chicken was super tasty and I would get it again.  My friend had a chicken sandwich with goat cheese and a beautiful roasted chili on it.  Looked great and I know she enjoyed it!  Healthy portion of chicken on it!  I will definitely come back!",

Perfect price for its size. The pasta had some flaws though. Super saucy and not enough cheese. And it's took forever for us to get our food!!! We were about to go up and complain but right then we got our food. Customer service was swell which helped me forget about my meh pasta and long waiting. If you're in the area then I would recommend Rachel's kitchen, otherwise it's not a place you would go out of your way for.",

I'd been hearing about RK and I suppose I came in with some level of expectation. Those in my party all loved their meals. Really loved. So much so that they suggested returning in a few weeks. I kept tasting my 2 hard scrambled eggs, thin toast, and dried potatoes thinking I was missing something. What we're they tasting that I wasn't? And then I tasted the breakfast wrap and was convinced this was not the place for me.  Again with the hard eggs only this time in a flavorless wrap. The food was overly simple and should have been piping hot and better seasoned. It was none of those things. I just found it to be dull.   I'm glad there are many more \"better for you\" food options in town, but taste has got to part of the equation for me. I'm no great cook, but when I'm stabbing at my plate thinking about how I can make much better eggs and potatoes at home, it's time for me to walk away.",

They didn't look freshly made and they tasted dry. :(  Best thing I think was my fresh squeezed Sweet Greens juice--reminded me of my Mean Green juice recipe.

I made little pre running stop looking for healthy smoothies or juice too kick start the day. They have pretty big selection comes too juices, smoothies, and goes on and on. I really enjoy the Hawaiian Bliss. All the drinks you can add protein powder for extra dollar either soy or whey. I added some whey loved it. Not sure all the ingredients just tasted light, refreshing with all the fresh fruit, and protein powder extra boast start running day.   After the run came back for lunch with friend and running partner. Once again talk about  nice selection from salads, pastas, sandwiches, and more. I was feeling some pasta and carbs after morning run. So went with the Signature Pasta. It was good. The thing that stood out the most for me is the fact hearty till the bottom of the bowl. Not so much the chicken although too be fair nice amount of chicken in the bowl. The diced eggplant, other vegetables, and really nice tomato cream sauce that just right amount of sauce too pasta. The pasta never was drowning in sauce. Yet once get too the bottom of the bowl each bite still coated with the sauce. The portion size is GREAT! You do pay little extra maybe because everything more health conscious in mind. Everything tasted fresh, and getting healthy always good thing in life. Looking for healthy place too eat Rachel Kitchen sure is great spot! If not for all the construction going on in The District would say great place too sit on the patio out front, people watch, great meal, and great company great conversations good times. Now that I had my Rachel Kitchen fix look forward too checking out more of the menu. Best thing about multiple  locations one much closer too my side of town. Yay!   The service and workers are fabulous. They great job of explaining the menu since it was my first time. We sat outside for lunch. Never felt neglected the whole time someone coming out checking on us making sure everything was great. Inside one of the best things with the high ceilings easy too have conversations. I like the colors interior nice relaxing, cozy, and feels like doing it healthy way.",

I've tasted the pasta and it is light and has a great garlic flavor. My banana chocolate chip pancakes had craters where the bananas must have fallen out or stuck to the pan. FAIL.  S: Sit in the chairs and not the bench against the wall if you have short legs.  T: Tasty beverages. I will give them that. A: Awesome cucumber water. Nice touch Rachel's. R: Ridiculously loud music.

    "text": "Been to this place a few times. We pre-order their food for occasional meetings at the office. Every time I arrive to pick up our order, I have to stand in a long line. Why don't they have a 'Pickup Only' window?   When it's finally your turn, you're foods not even ready. Even though, you ordered it hours ago. So now you get to stand off to the side in a separate line with other irate customers.   When you do get your food, it's disappointing. By the time I get back to the office (which is right next door), the food is at room temperature. They should consider wrapping things in foil before putting them in boxes. Or use better containers. They had my burger in one of those eco-friendly fold up boxes. Hooray for saving the environment. 'Boooo' for me.   Today I arrived and miraculously there was no line. I stood there like a moron though, while workers stared from behind the counter, but said nothing. Awkward. Finally a short girl greeted us after making eye contact several times and saying nothing for a moment. It was a very listless greeting, like someone who just really hated their job. They gave me my order, then I left. When I got back to the office, guess what? Room temperature food. I ordered a mushroom cheeseburger with onion rings. They gave me three onion rings. Three. I get that's it's a place for health conscious people, but really? If you're going to serve some not-so-healthy onion rings, then at least offer the standard 5 or 6 in my meal. Also, who puts mushrooms over the cheese? And really. . . Diced lettuce? The burger overall was puny, rubbery, and cold. The onion rings were cold.    I will say this though. . . they have some really good smoothies. Only thing worth getting so far.",

Very nice, they are located near trees so you get some shade as well.  I imagine it wouldn't be comfortable at noon when it's over 100, but in the morning for breakfast it's great.  I've had the breakfast wrap and the protein scramble.  The wrap is a whole wheat wrap with bacon, eggs, cheese, and tomato.  I had them substitute the housemade salsa for tomato.  This was solid, but not spectacular.  The scramble on the other hand was excellent.  Spinach, bacon, chicken, with melted cheese.  Will definitely get this one again, the chicken and spinach are great together.  Breakfasts come with potatoes, which are diced and fried.  No seasoning, which is very annoying.  It's the weakest part of what otherwise is a very good meal.  I liberally use pepper and hot sauce on them.  You can substitute fruit for $1.25, which we did the second time we ate here.  Melon and pineapple mostly.  It's a good serving size.  The wife had the favorite scramble, which has a bunch of veggies and goat cheese.  I generally like anything with goat cheese, and this was no exception.  The sun dried tomatoes were really good in there.  The toast with homemade jam is a must.  Very good strawberry jam and good quality wheat toast.  It's a very solid breakfast for a good price in a nice location.  Hard to beat that...",

The high ratings are definitely well deserved as the food was delicious and fresh and the space plentiful and clean. Also, I am loving the patio seating until it gets scorching hot outside.  I parked in the plentiful lot behind Lucille's BBQ at The District, and it was only a short walk form there.  I ordered off their \"Lighter Side\" menu and opted for the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. Both the salad and the sandwich were delicious. The sandwich had grilled chicken breast, grilled eggplant, roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes, romaine lettuce and reduced fat mayo. Clocked in at about 330 calories with the salad. Not bad for a filling, quality lunch. Calories well spent.  My only gripe is that the calories are only displayed on the \"Lighter Side\" portion of the menu.  This is a great go-to spot for a healthy lunch.",

Three times now, the kitchen has forgotten about my order, and it has taken them over 20 minutes to get my food to me... this isn't a fancy restaurant, nor is it a wait service so it should not be taking 20 minutes to get your food. The staff is not very friendly either. They joke around and laugh with their coworkers in the back, but when they are assisting their customers they can't even manage a smile on their faces, or a welcoming hello.",

The wrap was tasty and the sweet potato fries  were crispy and not mushy like other places. The front of the store is all glass so you have a nice view of everything that is going on outside of the store. You can chill-out and watch all of the people walking their dogs, or watch all of the people jogging by. Its a nice setup. I would have given them 5 stars but the employees just seemed a bit disconnected. Maybe its because they were busy or because it was early when we ate their.",

So... every time bf and I come to Vegas, we make it a point to come here.  Not only cause his sister works here, but the food here is just short of amazing.  We take the drive from SD at about 3am, and end up getting here just in time for breakfast.  I always order the oatmeal.  Not sure why, but this stuff here tastes like it was not only made with love, but it is different and wonderful and just plain WHOLESOME.  They give you a huge bowl of it; enough for two, but I finish it like theres no tomorrow.    I also order their watermelon juice.  Made from real watermelons, and its none of that artificial coloring/juices crap anywhere else.  Their banana pancakes taste just like Jack Johnson said they would.  (Lame joke.)  Its a little ways off of the strip, but if you ever find yourself in the Green Valley area, come here.  Its in a small shopping center with Anthropologie and Francesca's, as well as a cute little patio for you to eat in.",

But when Rachel's Kitchen moved in, spiffed up the place with new seat cushions, cute tables and, most importantly, a wine menu, I had high expectations for a more sophisticated dining experience, food included.The service and atmosphere are outstanding.The staff could not be nicer.I'm a wee bit disappointed because the food's just okay.   The most memorable part of my \"440\" chicken sandwich ($10.50) was the size of the red pepper. I believe they cut a pepper in half, roasted it, and laid it over the chicken. It was an unbelievable amount of red pepper. Other than the pepper, the chicken, goat cheese and avocado sandwich wasn't dressed up. It tasted like something I would make at home. Sometimes when I eat out, the food tastes better, as if there's a thin layer of honey butter spread all over everything.    My husband ordered the chicken curry wrap and we exchanged halves. His wrap wasn't any better than my 440.   The ingredients are fresh, the wine is okay, and the outdoor seating is lovely. I kind of wish they would have spiffed up the menu in the same way they spiffed up the decor.",

The sourdough was not sour at all. It was like stale, thick cut white bread. The veggies were good and fresh, chipotle mayo was tasty, the meat was like cheap deli meat from the grocery store. For $10, I would have expected better meat and bread. I could have made a better sandwich at home. The onion rings were crispy and not greasy. My coworker had the turkey club with french fries. She also ordered it on sourdough and was disappointed in the bread and meat. She said it was the worst bacon she had ever tasted. How do you mess up bacon?! She said it tasted metallic. The fries were completely bland. No seasoning, not even a small sprinkle of salt. I would return to try something else if it wasn't so damn expensive. For $10 I can get better food, with a drink at Panera around the corner.",

Food is pretty consistent, service is decent (most often with a smile), and location is great when it's nice outside; inside is a bit cramped. My go-tos here are the signature pasta, either turkey-based sandwich, or the breakfast wrap & burrito. They're great about substitutions (I do some weird stuff with my orders sometimes, or \"creative,\" if you wanna be nicer about it). Bottom line: not my absolute favorite breakfast/lunch place in the world, but one I'll keep coming back to. Bonus: they have a liquor license and use fresh OJ in their mimosas!",

The only con is that it can get rather pricey if you want to upgrade to eggwhites and/or switch out fruit for the potatoes. At Cracked Egg, you can tailor your meal to anything you want and they won't charge you a dime to substitute or replace something with another. Potatoes nothing to write home, they are fried and not seasoned with anthing. I do love the ambiance of being able to sit outside- they have the misters going during the day/night and theres enough trees right there to give some shade! Go for the pancakes and/or smoothies. Haven't been there for lunch or dinner, so can't comment on that.  The fact that everything is made fresh though, and the staff is always friendly and you can enjoy the beautiful setting give this 5 stars!",

The best thing about this place is when it's nice outside you want to sit outside.  Overall the food is really good.

When the weather is nice, it is a fantastic casual place to dine al fresco.  They serve breakfast all day, which I love, and have beer & wine.  I was worried that when the District added parking on the interior road, it would make dining outside less enjoyable but I have not found that to be an issue or bother at all.  On this visit to Rachel's, we started by sharing the yogurt parfait, which comes with fresh berries and their delicious housemade granola.  This vanilla yogurt parfait has the perfect mix of salty and sweet with a great crunch.  Then I got the scrambled eggs w/ tomatoes & basil meal.  This comes with toast and breakfast potatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and the tomatoes & basil were fresh and light.  I ate a couple potatoes, which were good, but I was already full from the parfait!  The BF got the sauteed mushroom cheeseburger.  He said it was fantastic, but since I hate mushrooms and swiss, I will have to take his word for it.",

I noticed a tuna sandwich on the menu board and asked if it was a tuna melt?  No, but they certainly could make a tuna melt was the reply.  So I ordered the tuna melt with swiss cheese and fries.  Husband ordered the angel hair bolognese. Bolognese?  Just ok.  Didn't finish it and didn't take home leftovers. Tuna melt?  Anther story.  ICE cold.  Mushy lettuce.  Cheese not melted.  Now if I remember, a tuna melt is warm, cheese melted and bread grilled golden.  My advice, please don't offer to make a tuna melt if you don't know how to prepare a tuna melt. Fries?  The most pale (and again cold) fries.  I would equate them to leftover fries warmed in the microwave. They brought the food to our table and that was that.  No \"how is everything?\" Nothing.  So, I can't rate the staff as friendly or that they care what people think.   I may stop for a smoothie when walking the District, but that's all. $30 for Bolognese and tuna melt, no drinks.",

My hubby has ordered the \"create your own\" omelette that came with country potatoes and toast, he commented it was basic, but filling.

The other shops are not open, the outdoor seating is shaded, and it provides a nice, quiet place to sit and catch up with friends or loved ones.  Rachel's offers many different options for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and I appreciate that their food is prepared fresh and not out of boxes. Many of the entrees come with the option for fresh fruit as a side. I like the proton scramble (includes chicken breast and spinach) and also the two egg plate with bacon and toast for breakfast.  The staff is friendly and helpful. If you have questions regarding an item they are more than willing to assist you. This place is a small hidden gem, and a favorite for some quiet breakfast.",

Lots of breakfast-all-day choices. But I felt like a salad so I went with the chopped salad ($11). The out door seating area consists of about 10 small bistro tables with uncomfortable chairs. The salad was a fairly large bowl of finely chopped veggies with a predominance of broccoli plus a little rice thrown in. Fairly flavorless. Not bad, just not good. Definitely won't be coming back.",

It came with a side of fries but I believe you can substitute it for other healthier side options.  The chicken salad was very good.  The chicken salad had chopped apples and grapes, not something every other chicken salad has, but it was a great addition.  I ordered a half soup/ half salad.  The soup of the day was a roasted red pepper and tomato soup.  I thought it was just okay.  Good for dipping the bread that came with it.   My salad was the grilled vegetable and chicken salad.   The salad could have used a little more of its dressing and the chicken was overcooked and dry.    There are so many options for food here and everyone around us had something looking delicious.  There's indoor and outdoor seating and the staff was very friendly.  I'll come back again to try something new when I'm in the area.",

And Peet's coffee.  Delish, as was the salsa.  We've heard good things so we were anxious.  They tout themselves as wholesome, so when breakfast came we were let down.  Immediately we noticed the potatoes.  Not at all wholesome -- right from Smart/Final, maybe Ore-Ida.  I expected freshly made there.  We both ordered omelettes.  Again disappointing.  Overcooked, with the cheese on the outside.  This doesn't allow the two sides to melt together.    We might give it another chance for lunch.  But for a $28 breakfast, we won't be coming back.",

    "text": "After a disappointing experience I returned to Rachel's to get my husband a sandwich. In my latest review I stated that Rachel's had cut back on child portions as well as fries, and that the fries were under cooked. Here is a picture of the turkey club with a side of fries. ( honest we didn't eat any!)This is the amount of fries you get with a sandwich side. Of all the things to cut back on, really. Fries have to be the cheapest thing on the menu, and the fries were under cooked. This was after I brought this to the managers attention. Feeling very frustrated!  (Previous post below) Very disappointed in Rachel's Kitchen! This is always my go to meal for my friends and family. We patronize this restaurant frequently.  Unfortunately, today I bought 4 kids meals and to adult meals.  I was surprised to find they cut the kids meal portion and still charge the same amount. So there are now only two chicken fingers in the child portion and a very small order of fries. When I asked about why there were hardly any fries, the attendant told me that the owner instructed them to decrease portion sizes. So I ordered an extra side of fries to share with the kids. When I got home with my meals, they were under cooked and mostly didn't get eaten. I also ordered a Cobb salad and Garden burger with a salad. The lettuce looked like it hadn't been washed and had dark specks of dirt or ? on the leaves. It was very frustrating as we usually get good service and quality of food. Guess I will have to find a new place.",

I love coming here for lunch when I'm in the area.  And, they recently expanded so they're twice as big now which is great!  The food is delicious and really fresh.  You really get the feeling they pride themselves on their menu and quality of ingredients.  I usually get the spinach salad with chicken.  It's excellent and really filling but light.  Their smoothies, especially the peanut butter blast, are just sweet enough and light enough you don't feel too guilty ordering them.  I did have an unfortunate experience there last time.  I ordered the sweet greens juice (fresh kale, spinach, cucumber, celery, apple, lemon & ginger root they juice themselves) and the grilled garden burger.  The juice tasted like I was straight up sucking dirt up through a straw and the garden burger wasn't very flavorful at all.  I think I just ordered the wrong things, but that meal made me sad.  Even with that previous experience, I'll still go back to Rachel's Kitchen.  Next time, I'll just be more aware of what I order!  The friendly customer service, quality of ingredients, and deliciousness of most their menu items definitely outshine one bad experience there.  And I'll still continue recommending this place to others, just not the sweet greens juice or veggie burger!",

    "text": "My sister lives in Henderson and so when I am in town we often go to the District to eat and/or shop. I found this little gem on my last trip. I ended up going there twice during my 4 day stay since the food was so good.   First time was on a Sunday afternoon. I had the Gorgonzola burger with sweet potato fries. Both were excellent. The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection. The cheese on top gave it a really great flavor. I am a sweet potato fries fanatic and these were not the best ever, but pretty good just the same. I also had an ice cold beer with my meal; glad to see they had some good bottled micro-brews. The combo really hit the spot and I left extremely satisfied even though I was ravenous when we arrived. My friend got the spinach salad and when I tasted it it was also very good. She also took advantage of the $3 mimosas they offer on Sundays and said they were perfectly made.   When we went back with my sister a couple days later I decided to try a salad since that is what they are known for. I got the arugula and pear one and it was delicious! A lot of texture and crunch. It had a bite to it from the arugula but the pear balanced this with a little sweetness and the goat cheese and fennel added an extra flavor dimension. My friend got the same spinach salad (she liked it that much!) and a Bellini which she said was not nearly as good as the mimosas. My sister had a wrap and regular fries. She said they were good but nothing special. I think the best items at this place are definitely the salads.   I agree with some reviewers' comments that the prices seem a little steep for what you get. But the quality of the food and the excellent service make it well worth what you pay. Sitting out on the patio on a nice day, this is a great place for a ladies' lunch or even a brunch/lunch date. We did notice that on weekdays this seems to be a haven for mommies/nannies with little ones in tow. But on the weekends I agree with the other reviewers that this is definitely a dog-lovers hangout.",

The location appears to be extremely small and cramped inside, but the beauty of being in The District is that you can eat outside when the weather permits and they bring your order outside to you.  As a vegetarian, they do have a few choices for me. There's the Vegetarian Gourmet Sandwich and the Ultimate Grilled Cheese. They also have a Grilled Garden Burger but as a creature of habit, I always get the Vegetarian Gourmet Sandwich. I love the way that it is prepared and the veggies are always super fresh, juicy and delicious! I am also a big fan of their fries! :) Next time I visit, I have to get out of my comfort zone and try the grilled cheese or the burger. Both sound really good!  I'd recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good sandwich. I also found out by accident that there's one just five minutes from my house in Summerlin. Have to hit that location here really soon. The only downside outside of it being pretty small inside is that it is a little pricey, in my opinion. But it's worth it.",

    "text": "I like the concept, but after 1 visit a month ago I can't say we've really been itching to go back.   Signature Pasta ($11.50) Penne with chicken breast, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms with our Tomato cream sauce.   Hmmm does that say cheese anywhere?! I was doing no cheese for Lent and was pretty upset when I got my take out container home and saw the entire thing was covered in thick goopy mozzarella. Cheese issues aside, it wasn't particularly special - especially for the price.   BBQ Chicken wrap ($9.95) - husband got this, again wasn't overly impessed.   The saving grace was the reasonably priced and AMAZING smoothie -  Hawaiian Bliss ($4.50) - pineapples, bananas, coconut, pineapple juice, NF vanilla yogurt. YUM (but if you follow my reviews you know I'm a pineapple/banana/coconut slut, so I guess me liking this isn't all that surprising!).   They do have $3 mimosas on Sundays so hopefully I'll be back at some point to try the breakfast with a mimosa! Additionally, I've heard the patio seating is doggie friendly - a major plus .",

    "text": "I want to like Rachel's Kitchen more than I do.  To me, this place should be a slam-dunk.  They offer fresh food and healthy alternatives to the normal restaurant fare.  However, there are a few things that really bother me about this place.  Let me elaborate.  The first problem I've encountered is inconsistency.  I like going to places where I know that I can order the same thing more than once and get, well, the same thing.  Sometimes I get stuck in ruts and return to places over and over for a particular menu item.  That's how I know whether a place is consistent or not... and this place isn't.  I have ordered the same wrap (a BBQ chicken one) a dozen or so times.  Sometimes it absolutely blows me away.  Sometimes it is flavorless and skimpy on the filling.  Since I never know which way it is going to be prepared, I usually opt for other food places while I'm at The District.  The prices at Rachel's are similar to Panera, but at least I know how my Panera will taste.  Secondly, the service is somewhat lacking.  At times, I've been greeted with a smile.  Other times, I am greeted with a huff.  It goes along with this consistency issue that seems to be a theme at Rachel's - I like to know that I'm not going to be punished because the person taking my order is having a bad day.    Lastly, some of the tables are TINY.  Like, barely large enough for two people to comfortably fit their orders on the tabletop.  Last time I visited, my fiance ordered a salad and I had a wrap.  Once you added drinks and utensils to the mix, it was a cramped mess.  Between the crowded tabletop and the fact that the table was scooted waaaaay too close to the line of people waiting to order, I felt claustrophobic and wanted to leave.  When Rachel's is good, it's some of the best food around.  When it's not, it feels like highway robbery.  I really wish this place would live up to its potential!",

It wasn't my favorite sandwich ever, but the ingredients were very fresh. I loved my Hawaiian Bliss smoothie though. I'm a fan of different textures in my drinks, so the coconut in my smoothie was great. The second time I went to Rachel's, I had their Granola with Yogurt and Fruit. It was delicious! I highly recommend this if you're a granola fan. I definitely plan on stopping by again to try more of their menu items.",

This place definitely stands out from your average sandwich/wrap/salad joint.   I had the pleasure of tasting the \"440\" Sandwich- very satisfying! Your choice of bread, [I WOULDNT CHOOSE THE FRENCH BREAD AGAIN though, only because all the ingredients kept slipping out and just plain made a mess of everything] comes with CHICKEN, AVOCADO, SWEET RED PEPPER, LETTUCE, TOMATO- DELICIOUS. You get a choice of onion rings, sweet potatoes, or fries. I tried both the ONION RINGS AND SWEET POTATOES, but the sweet potatoes take the cake! YUMMY. I also tried the WATERMELON JUICE - it was good, but I didn't get what everyone was raving about in reviews- I mean, it simple, just plain watermelon juice. If you try it, make sure you ask for ice in your cup!   What I enjoyed most about this place is that there's a variety of items on the menu- something for everyone- pasta, burgers, hummus, dessert items etc.. I wasn't too fond of their seating arrangement and the place is really small. AND sadly the service was not very good as they completely forgot to make my friends order- ON THE PLUS SIDE: they gave him a free dessert for the mistake. I would come here again and recommend it to all my health junkies :)",

    "text": "Finally got around to trying Rachel's and I'm so glad I did!  I met Ms. Fake-Up herself, Dana S, for a spur of the moment lunch and jaunt around The District. I had a hard time finding her in the restaurant because I'm not used to seeing her without all that fake-up lols. I was hungry but also trying to just be a healthier person (don't tell that to the peanut butter cookies I just snarfed) so I got a curried chicken salad over top a green salad. The green salad part kind of ruined it--personal preference...I just don't like vinaigrette and I didn't realize it had vinaigrette on it. No matter, though, because the chicken salad was good and next time, I'll get just the chicken salad with a sandwich instead.  Also got the watermelon juice. Yes, it was tasty. Yes, I can understand that it's winter and the prices have to pay for more than just the juice. But over $4 for this juice was really pricey. I will skip it next time to just save a little change.   As for the other aspects of business--service, excellent. Decor, excellent. Dining al Fresco? Gotta get on that before it gets to be like stepping into the seventh circle of Hell outside.   Skip Panera and come here. Actually go to Panera just for the cookies after lunch.   No Danas were harmed in the creation of this Yelp review.",

    "text": "The beginning of fall in Las Vegas really makes you want to eat outdoors.  Rachel's Kitchen in The District was a good pick for us while we were out and about.  We recently went vegan so choosing the right place to eat with a non-vegan in tow can be exhausting.  I asked one of the servers there on what options we can have and she showed me on the menu what we can have and what we can modify to suit our diet.  I ordered the Tomato & Basil Pasta, my partner had the Veggie Wrap, and mom had Pancakes with a side of bacon.  Can you tell who is the non-vegan here.  HAHA!    Let me tell you, the pasta essentially can be divided into 3 or even 4 servings.  It was so good that I had to pace myself and had enough leftovers for 2 servings for lunch for me and the hubby the next day!  The Veggie Wrap was good also.  Obviously I couldn't partake on the pancakes & bacon, but from moms' reaction, they were both good.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy and the bacon was crispy.    Rachel's Kitchens' customer service is awesome.  Not only do their servers know what they are selling, the constant walk through by them outside kept us hydrated and our plates cleaned once we were done eating.    I highly recommend this place for good eats, good drinks, and if you love people watching, their patio is the best place for it!",

I'd say the meals are uncomplicated, you an actually see what is in them and how the food is made. You can eat quite healthy here, or go nuts with a gourmet grilled cheese or burger.   Their burgers are a nice treat on gluten free bread if you can't do the normal bun. The sweet potato fries are damn near perfect. Everything I've ever tried here has been fantastic, including the banana chocolate chip pancakes (I had a \"gluten day\").",

    "text": "I'm always down for a lunch date at Rachel's kitchen! It's a favorite spot of mine to meet friends and enjoy a meal that doesn't mean indulgence overload.  Food: there's a wide selection of fresh juice, wraps, and sandwiches and the like. You can grab larger meal and a glass of wine if that's your thing that day or you can get a small juice and a salad if you're wanting something lighter. I LOVE the pear arugula salad and add chicken to it - thank me later!  Service: everyone at Rachel's kitchen is super friendly. The service is consistent from the person who takes my order to the one who brings my food. They always are accommodating with adjustments to meals.  Environment: situated in the District on Green Valley, RK has areas inside and out to enjoy time with friends and family over a meal or quick bite. When the weather is amazing, outdoor seating is limited because of the nice atmosphere on the patio. There's never shortage of places to sit inside either.   I'm a fan. I come here a lot. They take all of my money for that pear arugula salad.",

The restaurant itself is opening seating outside and inside. The ceiling is really high up and gives a very open feeling with the large windows. Most people who come here look like are coming from work, working out, or bringing their kids from school.  Service: the staff are all very friendly. You order at the register and get a number. They bring out the food and drinks pretty quickly.   Food and drinks: there are sooo many options here. You can get wine, coffee, mimosas, and smoothies. Their food menu is also very extensive from pasta to brunch foods to sandwiches and wraps. All of these options are delicious though and the entrees are decently sized so you are never too full and never hungry.  Overall, I enjoy coming here for lunch on the weekends to enjoy the district area with some healthy and fresh drinks and food.",

I had the spinach salad with tuna & it was delicious & a huge portion! Definitely big enough for 2. I did my best to finish it, but fell short. The tuna was seasoned which added to the great flavor of the salad. The goat cheese and mushrooms were so yummy! My dining partner had one of the pasta meals and said it was very good.   The indoor area was not what I expected. All the furniture is patio/outdoor stuff, which just looked weird. The space is very open, with a high ceiling. It lacked warmth. Perhaps this is due to it being more of a quick serve eatery then a stick around & chat after your meal place. They do serve alcohol, beer & wine, and as of this writing there's a yelp check in deal for free glass of wine with entree. Cheers to that!",

It's always one of the busiest spots in the shopping center. Good thing they have outdoor seating for nice days as well.  The menu options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all good. They have a wide variety of menu options including sandwiches, salads, burgers, smoothies, wraps, and pasta. My favorites are the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and the Signature Pasta. The Signature Pasta is a sizeable portion, those watching calories could probably make this into two meals. The Ultimate Grilled Cheese is a real treat and comes with yummy French fries.   The restaurant is inviting and has a variety of seating options including tables, booths, and outdoor seating. Pricing is very reasonable and definitely not expensive for the quality. Food is made to order, but the wait is never too long.  I also love that I can get my husband to eat here. Usually he scoffs at places like this, but the food is even to his liking!",

That being said, I also do not like leaving negative reviews unless they are helpful. So hopefully this is.  I have now had three separate instances where the customer service I've received has been horrible. I'm not one to ever ask for anything for free, but when you forget the chicken on a to-go salad order, (when actually ordering extra chicken) then take the time to call once you're home and notice, and still they are just like \"sorry, you can come back\", it's really frustrating. This isn't the first time I've had sub par customer service from them, and it's just really sad, as it makes me not want to come back.  There's a saying, \"people will forget what you said, but never how you made them feel.\" This location of Rachel's Kitchen made me (a frequent customer) feel like my dollar is all they want from me.  I'm sure I will venture into this location again out of necessity, but dang-- we live in Las Vegas-- customer service is everything.",

I got the tuna wrap with fries, wife got a chicken salad with arugula and goat cheese, and we got a bowl of mac and cheese for the kid.   The tuna wrap was \"ok\", the tuna salad itself had a little more large chunks of raw lettuce and shredded carrots in it than I cared for but it was still pretty good. They didn't ask what kind of wrap I wanted so I just assumed there was only one kind - it ended up being a whole wheat one which was fine. It made me feel like I made a healthy choice. :) The fries on the side were meh.. they were unsalted and tasteless.   Wife's salad was ok except she wasn't really a fan of goat cheese. It is quite pungent and more of an acquired taste if you ask me. I would have asked to sub it with something else but to each his/her own.  The kid's Mac and cheese.. Oh my god it was delicious. He didn't finish it as it was a pretty large portion, so naturally I ended up eating most of it. It is a white cheese blend with mushrooms and onions in it. It's absolutely fantastic! Cheesey creamy goodness with the different textures from the onion and mushrooms. I'll have to order this as an entree for myself next time!",

My go to items are either one of the salads or the \"440 sandwhich\". The staff is always friendly and brings you your order. I've been meaning to try the breakfast because the menu looks delicious. The only minor complaint I have would be it's a little on the pricey side. I know they have really fresh ingredients so I can't complain too much. I still will continue coming here because it's so tasty though!  Also when the weather is nice you can sit outdoors with your dog which is a major plus!",

I also ordered the watermelon juice and it was awesome! I would recommend this spot for sure. I heard they have amazing salads so I am definitely going back to try lunch!",

As I was trying to order my breakfast the cashier was not only helping me but helping somebody else at the same time. This made him take almost 10 min to just take my order. After waiting another 15 min for my food I walked over to coffee bean, had enough time to talk with some friends I ran into, and then returned and still my food wasn't ready. Finally somebody asked me if I've been helped and I pointed to a to go bag and said I have been waiting for my food and am pretty sure that is mine. The worker told me that was THEIR food. So after waiting a total of 30 minutes they tell me that the hold up was to make themselves food. Finally 5 minutes later I received my order to later notice that half of the bags were torn open at the bottom and leaking. Thanks a lot Rachel's kitchen at the district you will never have my business ever again.",

Not being familiar with your reciepies, samples may increase your sales. I ordered the Cobb Chicken Salad and a pecan dessert, my husband had a lite salad and chicken sandwich including passion teas.

They have very good food here: fresh and a lot of healthy options so you can justify a higher calorie coffee or maybe one of their smoothies that look so delish (although I haven't tried one yet).  The ambiance is perfect!  I love sitting outside here when the weather is nice.  You order at the counter and they bring your food to you, check up on how you are, and take your empty plates away when you're done.  Considering all of this I wonder why more people don't tip- they are essentially being waited on with the exception of having to go to the counter for the initial order.  Tip them a couple of bucks, the kids here can't make all that much money.    I love the salads here but the breakfast food is also delish!  My sister got a mimosa with her french toast breakfast, how cool to offer mimosas in the morning!  A perfect way to start our day off of work.  I'll continue to keep coming back here, I've never had a bad experience.",

So, of course, I got my free glass of wine and ordered the turkey club on wheat bread which was delicious as always. They have a variety of sandwiches, soups, salads, and smoothies here. They also serve breakfast all day! The outside seating is wonderful for evenings and those rare days when it isn't 1000 degrees. Oh, and not to mention when I went here Conor McGregor was here!! You know,  that Irish dude that fights, who is probably the most famous UFC fighter right now. Needless to say, my experience here was FANTASTIC.",

The chicken on both the salad and the sandwich was less than 1/8 inch thick and was so dry and over cooked it was like shoe leather. It literally drew the moisture out of my mouth when trying to chew it. We paid $30 for a hamburger, 1/2 sandwich & 1/2 salad with ice water. After looking around at the other tables, it appeared most people had only ordered drinks or smoothies. I can now understand why. I would never recommend the food here.",

    "text": "I brought my mom yesterday morning with my dog to eat at Rachel's Kitchen at The District. Maybe because it was a combination amazing weather and ambiance at the restaurant, I thought this place is definitely worth updating on.   I ordered the Grilled Vegetable & Chicken Salad with the Turkey Avocado w/Bacon Sandwich to share. The chicken was thinly cut and grilled with the perfect charred taste. My mom and I enjoyed the other grilled vegetables like the bell peppers and zucchini that came with the salad, it was really refreshing! When I ordered the sandwich, the cashier asked if I wanted 2 or 3 pieces of sourdough bread and of course being so hungry i asked for 3. The bacon slices they used were actually the thick kind, not the really thin flabby strips that you find at other sandwich stores. We sat outside with our dog and enjoyed our food with the perfect weather.   I am really impressed how much has improved at The District, the additional parking in front of the store, additional seating, and cleanliness really makes this place such an enjoyable place. Few differences that would make me choose to eat at Rachel's Kitchen rather than Panera Bread is the friendliness of the staff, freshness of the food especially the salad, and being able to see the shops and people walk around while you are eating. Also I wanted to note is that the staff is friendlier and the wait time for your food was faster (yes it was busy) compared to the other Rachel's Kitchen locations.  Great job Rachel's Kitchen staff :)",

The menu next to the register has all of the details compared to the the large one above.  They make fresh juice!   I ordered the Popeye it had a strong taste of beets but tasted good overall. I chose the grilled cheese with onion rings.  They bring your order to the table.  The grilled cheese had tomato in it. The asiago in it mmm!!! It was perfect... Buttery toast with just enough crunch to the outside.  Delicious mix of cheese. The onion rings are thick and crunchy.  SO GOOD!  Only thing, they only give you 3 of them. I could eat a basket!  I'm craving it again already!",

    "text": "Mom loves the Turkey Club.  Dad wasn't impressed with the BBQ Bacon Burger.  It was dry, dad said, 'where's the beef' and wasn't fond of the BBQ sauce.  My 440 Chicken sandwich was super dry.  Also the goat cheese was not flavorful on it.  I needed to ask for a side of dressing to swallow it on the ciabatta bread.    I've been going to Rachel's since day one, but ALWAYS get the Chicken Chopped Salad, or Turkey Club with sweet potato fries... Amazing!!  All four of us had soggy sweet potato fries.  The Turkey Club as always gets 5 stars, but as a restaurant that I love, I don't always want to order the same two items.  Earlier this year I tried a breakfast omelette that I wasn't impressed with, but thought, maybe breakfast isn't the way to go so I stuck to the same lunch items next time.  I wasn't yelping at the time.    Posting pictures of my favorite CHOPPED CHICKEN SALAD & TURKEY CLUB!!  I highly recommend.    I am rating only three stars because it's my third time ordering something new & not impressed with.  If I stuck to my original favorites I'd give a 5 star, but expect more from Rachel's. The menu is simplistic and I believe can be better than that, especially when it comes to a chicken sandwich on ciabatta and a bacon burger.    Yesterday, September 27th 5pm the employees were wonderful, they get 5 stars.  I will be back to try something new again, hopefully or go back to usual the Chopped Chicken Salad.  Also checking in w/ an entree gets you a free glass of wine.",

    "text": "Ok I dont normally write poor reviews but Rachels Kitchen at the District Village Walk was such a let down.  The general feel was old and scruffy with the atmosphere and male staff no better!  Seating is uncomfortable and floor is all old and looked dirty.  I ordered the meat protein breakfast scrambler; picture uploaded too.  Well all I can say was the toast was nice!!  Seriously the place was miserable and so was my food; it really looked like it had just been scooped out of the pan grease and all with no presentation.    I dont know maybe im spoiled going to Corner Bakery and Panera where they really look after you but this place just didnt cut it.   To top it all off guys that work in the kitchen were glaring over and just walking around the floor on there phones.  As for the prices; well there are on the high side....lol... will not be back!!",

I also had the turkey avocado sandwich which was amazing! My fiance had the turkey wrap, my dad the chicken curry sandwich and my mom the chicken salad sandwich. Everyone loved their food and I can see us returning in the future! It was a great place to have lunch!  The only downside is that they don't have their drinks on the menu except for the wines and beers. We ended up getting bottled water because it was in the case and didn't think they had anything else to drink and didn't bother asking since it wasn't on the menu. Turns out they have teas and I believe lemonade and coffee. It would have been helpful if they put all of their offerings on the menu.",

And it takes 20 minutes that means someone is not delegating priority properly...  But its a nice place...the host was nice...but I would come back just to see if it happens again...",

The combination of fresh grilled veggies (eggplant, zucchini, roasted red peppers, squash, red onion and tomatoes) and goat cheese were mouthwatering. The sweet potato fries were good, not too soggy and not too crispy. I used my yelp check in offer and chose the lemon, poppyseed muffin. Wow was it good. I had to stop myself from eating more than half because it was so delicious. The lemon was a great add to the mix.  I'm hoping to try this place again soon. This time for a salad or breakfast!!",

Everything is always fresh and dishes are thoughtful but very casual. I've had most of their salads and they are great. I also tried their grilled cheese and it totally fulfills your cheesy fix.  I'm looking forward to trying them out for dinner some time. I also want to try some of their fresh fruit and veggie juices, possibly encourage me to do a cleanse.... for a day.",

The BF and I each got a sandwich, he had the chicken club and I had the 404. My sandwich was good, but not great. The ingredients were good; however, they let you choose your bread, I chose wheat thinking it would be a wheat roll of sorts....it was like sandwich bread from the grocery store and it did not hold the sandwich contents in and got soggy quickly. This was pretty disappointing. The BF liked his sandwich, but, again, did not like the bread. The sweet potato fries were kind of on the bland side. Also, the portions were huge and for a place that looks 'healthy' the portions were definitely not healthy. I thought it was just ok...I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",

They have everything from freshly pressed juices, smoothies, yogurt parfaits, sandwiches, wraps, pastas, breakfast - anything you feel like eating, you can find it here and it will be a healthy alternative! They only use natural and hormone-free chicken breast which I personally love. My favorites on the menu are the 440 sandwich, the fettuccine Alfredo and their salads (can't go wrong with anything you order though.) This place will not disappoint! I will continue to bring friends and family. Service is prompt as well! Even if they are slammed, it doesn't take me more than 15 mins to get my meal. Also, I have to shout out the owner - he is a doll! Stay cool and keep smiling! (Much love from the Costco girl! :)",

I opted for the Veggie Burger which consists of whole wheat bread, grilled veggie burger, and mixed greens.  It comes with a huge mixed green salad drizzled in a fat-free balsamic vinaigrette.  My friend chose the BBQ Chicken Wrap which has grilled chicken breast, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, onion rings, and BBQ sauce wrapped in a spinach tortilla with a side of french fries.  Both were tasty, light, and made for a perfect lunch as we basked in the sun in the outdoor seating.  It was a picturesque afternoon.  Big perk is that if you have a pet with you, Rachel's Kitchen is the perfect place to eat outdoors with your little one!  If you're ever in the area, give this place a try at least once!",

Fresh, healthy, wholesome food is certainly on the menu, but if you're like me, you go for the artery-clogging Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich.  Hey, I had sweet potato fries instead of the other, evil kind, so that's got to be a little redeeming, right?  Anyway, I don't feel guilty--it was GOOD and I enjoyed every bite.  I also liked the fact that when I checked in on Yelp, I had the option of receiving a FREE cookie or muffin--I LOVE free things!

The Acai bowl was more like a granola bowl - there was very little Acai on top.  I've had this at a few other places and usually the granola is sprinkled on top - not a load full on the bottom of the bowl.  It was delicious that the banana was blended in with the Acai, but then made it more room temperature.  :/  maybe I'll request not to be blended in next time ?  As for the French toast - the second I glanced at the dish I was confused.  \"Was this a baguette sliced up and dipped in egg?\"  Then I gave it a try anyways to see how it'll taste ... Not impressed :( I guess I like it the original way - with just a slice of white bread.    I guess next time till just stick to what I know is delicious - their sandwiches and wraps !!",

Great service overall, the food coming out was on a slow side so allow time for that.   Smoothies = awesomeness. Really - they are amazing. You have to get one.  Wraps - also good; curry chicken had interesting (in a good way) flavor.  Salad - Caesar w/ chicken was huge and tough to finish.

One time I came for a acai berry smoothie which was $6 for the smaller size but it was definitely worth it. I would come here for this smoothie every chance I get.

So after browsing the menu I decided to try the Acai bowl and Sweet green freshly Squeezed juice.  The juice was light and very refreshing - just how I like it.   The Acai Bowl was a little too runny for my liking. I should have checked as it did say \"Puree\".  I guess I'm just used to my Acai Bowls with more of a cold and frozen like consistency.. this one was not.   The bananas were not visible... I guess mushed in with the Acai.  The granola was nice and sweet, but smothered in the Acai.    So that's why the lower than normal review.   Service was great. There's plenty of seating inside and outside And it's clean.  I think next time I'll try something else though.",

When I checked in I got a comped glass of wine and I enjoyed it with my curry chicken salad, which was absolutely amazing.  Its at the District at Green Valley Ranch so there is ample parking available.  The service is great. You order at the counter and take your number to the table and they bring the food to you. The portions are a good size, not huge and not big.  My salad was $11 and felt worth it because they used spinach and mixed greens.",

I wished the cashier would of confronted me about only receiving 3 onion rings after I just told her what's the biggest meal they got.  Anyways the food was delicious nothing bad really about it. Fresh veggies and healthy buns. Next time I'll get the fries then 3 little onion rings as a side.",

I've been to the Summerlin location in the past but I've always wanted to get this one a shot as well.   I finished at the gym on Eastern and I was looking for a nice healthy option for breakfast. I decided to search yelp for healthy breakfast options and Rachel's came up so good opportunity to try it. I had a protein shake with me so I did not need any protein so I just went with the French Toast. It comes with a little bit of fruit on the side. They use old French bread for their French toast and it is super tasty. It was on the dry side which was perfect for me because that indicated to me that there was not a bunch of oil added.   The flavor was really good. It came with some syrup as well so I used that to dip into.   Great location, nice little place, several healthy options.  Highly recommend you give it a shot. I'll definitely be back.",

Also, the acai bowl is more filling and substantial than most I've had. It had a lot of berries and granola with the acai so it would make a great little breaky in the morning too.  Lastly, the watermelon juice! It's so simple but they do it so well. It's so sweet (but don't worry, no sugar added!) and refreshing. I ordered one large and they split it into two smaller cups and added light ice and it was basically full!  Rachel's kitchen is such a pleasant little stop of a quick bite!",

There were many options on the menu, but I decided to go for the Turkey club.  I mean cmon now, turkey, bacon, AND avocados all in a sandwich, I am sold!   The portion size was decent!  Not too big and not too small!  It came with either salad or fries (I chose the more unhealthier option).  If im going to have bacon, might as well throw in the fries right?! haha.    I'd definitely go back and try other things!  The smoothies looked good, maybe that next time!",

Everything is made with great ingredients, isn't greasy, and tastes like something that would really come out of your own kitchen. There's outdoor seating so it's a great place to hang out at the District when the weather is nice, or you can actually grab a beer here too for happy hour if you want to be a little good and bad at the same time while eating your chicken caesar wrap or wheat pasta.  Their green juice is awesome!",

    "text": "A couple days ago I went to Rachel's kitchen for the first time. It was very busy and they had music on the patio with a beautiful arrangement to sit down at.  I ordered a protein shake because I was in a hurry. The protein shake came with peanut buttercups, chocolate milk and bananas with peanut utter and non fat yogurt. I asked for soy or almond milk, no peanut butter cups and add strawberries. They did just that. However they neglected to inform me that they have no sugar added so the sweetness was from the peanut buttercups/chocolate milk and when I would receive my drink it would be bland.   After waiting 15 minutes for a protein shake I received mine blended to perfection. I tasted it and it was indeed what I mentioned previously (bland) . I came to the conclusion myself about the chocolate milk in my computer buttercups for sweetness. Considering i.e. healthy and organic I didn't complain because the lack of sugar is good for me. However for others that go to this kind of restaurant the staff should be a little more explanatory  when discussing the ingredients in their smoothies so that other people don't get a Blance movie and then the complaining.  The menu had an awesome variety of pastas, wraps and sandwiches as well as breakfast bowls and entrees! All things considering it was a great ambience a very clean restaurant and I would definitely try it again.",

Veggie burger was great. I think it had a homemade potato patty; what I know for sure is that it had a good, thick and filling mouthfeel. It may have had a few craisins or something too that added occasional touches of sweetness to an otherwise savory dish. The thick, homemade lemony hummus took me by surprise and blew me out of the water -- I definitely feel like I got more than what I paid for. The side salad was great too; the fruit was very cold as well as firm; just what I needed on a hot day.   My husband says his wrap was good: \"very flavorful and the amount of each ingredient was good\".  Maybe it's because my expectations were low going in but I had a great experience and would def go back!",

I love the Hawaiian smoothie because it's really filled with a ton of tropical flavor (and I pretend there's rum in it so I feel like I'm on a tropical vacation on the beach somewhere). I usually tend to pair it with the chicken tender wrap. My diet is mainly like a 10 year old, so chicken tenders are definitely my style. These ones are seasoned to perfection and are wrapped up in a flour tortilla. It's the best of both worlds. Wraps and chicken tenders. Bam!  Did I mention it comes with a side? I always go for the fruit. Trying to make up for that chicken tender wrap, ha!  The staff is always friendly and patient. I never wait too long in line but I always forget what I want. Sometimes I think, maybe I'll order a salad. But I always go back to that delish chicken tender wrap. At least I get some fruit on the side though. Balance, people.",

I have been here a handful of times and the food and service are amazing, always on point.   My go-to meal is usually breakfast because I love their breakfast wrap with a side of fruit or crisp potatoes. There is always a good balance of egg, bacon, and garnishments so it is never overstuffed with just one protein component. The food always has a fresh feel and it helps that they have so many options to complement what you get with a fresh smoothie or juice.   The huevos rancheros are delicious and texture has always been perfect when I get it. It has a great combination of crisp and softness with subtle acidity from the red sauce they make in-house. They have different types of pasta and sandwiches that are also quite good. I am a huge fan of the chicken salad sandwich and get that to-go when I am out on lunch from work throughout the week. The chicken salad is not overly seasoned and has a nice light creamy, yet subtle sweet and savory quality on a toasted ciabatta.   Cashiers are always rather friendly and helpful when you have inquiries regarding their menu. They ask questions to the cook line if there is anything they are unsure of, which is not a prevalent service gesture in other places for grab and go casual dining.   Location is smack dab walking distance to Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa, therefore, clean and contemporary with shopping all around the perimeter. Beautiful food, service, and location is worth appreciating!",

In the winter they pull out the heart warmers so it's still nice to eat outside!  There's always a line but it goes pretty quick. You order and then take your number and the food usually comes out within 10 mins.  Their food is always so fresh and so good.  Some of my favorites their is their chicken ceaser salad, turkey club, and their wraps! They also have delicious juices and smoothies. The energizer juice is soooo good it's my current favorite.  My only issue would the the birds outside. They are always hovering and usually just waiting for you to drop a piece of food. And most of the time plates are still left and haven't been picked up yet so the birds are having a hay day with it.",

My friend fussed in her purse for quite a while, digging out reading glasses.  Both young women working the counter were very patient with us.  Zaira was very hepful answering questions about the ingredients.  The young man who brought us our meal, as well as the young lady who asked our permission to clear our table, were polite, friendly and helpful.  I had a $35 Gift Card but only used $32 (lunch for two), so bought desserts on my way out, in order to use up the Gift Card balance.  The Lemon Bar was one of the best lemon bars I've ever had; maybe even the best.  I do not recommend the Pecan Bar.  It wasn't nearly as tasty (and I LOVE pecans, pecan pie and pecan pralines) as the Lemon Bar.  Also, whenever I'd fork it, the pecan mixture would break off and separately completely from the pie crust.  Every fork!  However, I put half of the Pecan Bar in the frig and ate it as my midnight snack.  After having spent hours in the frig, I was able to pick it up and eat it with my fingers.  It was delicious and didn't fall apart.  I had the Chicken Curry Salad.  It was good but VERY curry.  If you don't like a heavy curry flavor, this is not the salad for you.    My friend ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad.  It was excellent.  There were no rice noodles and only a few wonton strips at the bottom of the bowl.  Instead of those high-calorie, empty-calorie fillers, the salad was full of lettuce and vegetables.  There were strips of grilled chicken breast on top of the salad; a generous serving of chicken.",

I attributed the small size to most likely being the appropriate portion size for a normal person, not a very hungry person and decided to not pass judgment.  I went back and ordered a turkey club sandwich, tomato basil soup and side of fries. The sandwich was nice and tall, but there wasn't much turkey between the bread. The fries were under-cooked and still hard in spots, making them inedible. The tomato basil soup tasted more like dried oregano and had a weird yellow color. It was not good and I won't be going back.",

We do not serve anything room temp.\" Interesting. So we got a plastic cup to warm the wine. Definitel a first.",

Not only did they expand and have tons of seating now, but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends. It is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect. Now, on to the important stuff...  The blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit. My current addiction is the Wilshire smoothie. Their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juice-like than other places, but they are still super tasty. They also have a great regular breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon. The potatoes seem to be oven roasted and aren't greasy at all. That's the thing I really love about Rachel's kitchen, everything is done with your health in mind. I have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special. The onion rings were delicious, but there were only about 3 or 4 of them, which was disappointing.   This is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you won't feel guilty about later, so go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food!",

I was a little disappointed to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint. I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I like waiter service!!! We ordered and found ourselves a TINY little booth to accommodate us. The table was abnormally slim and not very practical.   Heat kept wafting from the kitchen area, which I found a little annoying. I ordered the grilled cheese and a watermelon juice. My friends ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was pretty good, not nearly good enough to be worth the somewhat hefty pricetag, but I digress. The food was fresh and my friends loved the potatoes, although I found them to be a tad soft and underseasoned. I loved my fresh watermelon juice and highly recommend that, so refreshing. Whenever I see that on a menu I have to order. It's my favorite.   All in all, I've had better, but this place will do in a pinch. I'm definitely not itching to go back and if I'm in the area again I'd probably try any number of other restaurant options. Good option for healthy eating, though.",

The first male cashier I asked a question to about the Mac and Cheese was VERY helpful. And answered all my questions.   The actual cashier who took our order GAVE me the wrong info.  I DO NOT EAT ANY FROZEN french fries , due to the fact that they have dextrose in them.  When I asked the cahier are the FF, frozen or fresh cut she said fresh.  Indeed they WERE NOT.   The atmosphere was nice , and the food was good.  But if your going to be a considered a HEALTHY restaurant you may want to use FRESH FF.  The frozen have ALLOT of bad sugars.  I know it is more trouble , but better quality.  I think you may of just lost a customer.  If your FF are not fresh and NOT organic , how do I know ALL your other food is the same.  Sorry guys. I used to own a restaurant , I know what it is like..  There for  being married to a chef of 25 years for 13 years.    I know good food.",

It is composed of spinach, bacon bits, nuts,  Chef Salad with the insides of a Rachel's special- Not on the menu decided to invite my own! haha! really deli-sh as well. It consists of chicken apples, and other healthy stuff.  Garden Pasta- Not really fond of it it had peas yuck.. But when i tasted it , the sauce it was cooked with was good.. just did not like peas.. hehe im sure you guys will love it.  Buffalo Chicken Wrap- wrapped in a tortia based texture, and in the inside of it it had lettuce, cheese, chicken, flavored with BBQ.. It was ok too BBQ tasting for me.. hehe  know i should have known it was in the name.. haha!  We wanted to try the popeye drink but it was not available kinda bummed out, but will be back and hopefully they will not run out.  Overall, I love this place, I feel good clean and healthy eating here.. There are so many options for everyone for health fanatics and for burger lovers, the menu has a little bit of everything that will fit everyone's foodie desires..  TRY NOW!!!!! :)",

Rachel's Kitchen is perfect for the District and really attracts a lot of people.  Young people, families, little children, there were so many people here.  I could tell that the food was going to be good.  I decided to get the Smoked Turkey and Avocado sandwich on wheat bread.  This sandwich has smoked turkey, avocado, swiss cheese, mixed greens, tomatoes and chipotle mayo with a mixed salad as my side.  The sandwich is huge!  I appreciated the huge chunks of avocado.  The chipotle mayo really married the sandwich together.  I also loved the balsamic vinaigrette on my mixed green salad side.  No wonder why this place was packed!  The food was great :)  The service was top notch as well!  Everyone was so attentive and more than one server kept visiting our table to see if we were doing great.  I definitely think you need to get your butt here.  You will absolutely love it.  Great new joint in the District at Green Valley.",

Since breakfast is offered all day, the three pancakes I ordered at 2:00pm were served at room temperature rather than hot, without butter. When I asked for some butter, the server cheerfully brought three rock hard cubes of ice cold butter. How can ice cold butter melt on cold pan cakes?  Coffee is offered light, medium, and dark roast. All the carafes except one, were empty, and from that I could only get one cup of light roast (although I wanted dark roast).and even that cup was cold. The manager apologized and promised that all the carafes would be filled with fresh hot coffee in five to ten minutes. When we finished or meal, almost an hour later, only one carafe of light roast coffee was finished and nothing else was being brewed.  My companion ordered an omelet. It was served tough, tasteless, and barely warm.  While there were several what appeared to be high school or college students running the restaurant, the whole atmosphere appeared to be disorganized if not chaotic. I asked if the owner was there, and was told she was not and only stops by perhaps once a week. I guess if one is an absentee owner of a business, leaving the day to day operation to kids, one should not be surprised to have these results.",

    "text": "Rachel's Kitchen in the District at Green Valley Ranch is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  Like many things in life, you get what you pay for.  If all I wanted was filler meal for $5, I might settle for a sub.  Rachel's is nothing of the sort.    I had the much reviewed 440 sandwich.  A quick list of the ingredients including the red pepper and goat cheese indicate the excellence.  I am a big eater and found the sandwich and onion rings quite satisfying.    Jessica had Arugula Pear salad.  She enjoyed it very much.  I tried it too and found it to be of a high quality.  We shared an excellent smoothie made of nice fruit ingredients.    The location in Green Valley is excellent with nice outdoor seating.  Many dog people found it to be an accommodating atmosphere too.  All in all, I highly recommend Rachel's Kitchen for a top notch lunch or dinner.",

We went inside to order and had to wait some time to get someone to help out.  Once the order was completed, we had difficulty finding a clean table on the inside, being that they were all dirty also.  We had to go back to get a cup for the drink we had purchased.  No lids available.  The table we finally sat at needed to be wiped down.  The staff were all talking and walking around trying to find a man a place to plug in his phone to charge.  They were not helping the other people waiting to order.  At this point, it became comical.  No sense of urgency was seen at any point while we were inside this establisment.  It's a shame.  After this experience, I will no longer want to patronize any of the Rachel's kitchens in the valley.  The food wasn't anything spectaular and the service was terrible.",

The burger was over cooked (well done) almost dry. The bread was blackened on the bottom bun and the whole thing didn't have flavor. I would have taken the food back and had them make it again but I had to go to work.  The only reason I gave two stars is cuz you can tell the quality they use on there food is good.

    "text": "Went there last night for dinner with some friends & while we were there waiting for our food order there were 3 men across from us & one of them was very intoxicated & sick.  The workers knew that the man was sick but the other two ordered food & then put it in a bag for take out.  Then when we received our order the man who was sick threw up all over the floor & table where they were sitting.  We were within 10 feet from it.  If you want to see a restaurant clear out it did.  Then the manager decided to call security.  The men finally took their friend who was sick out of the restaurant & then the workers finally cleaned the place after 15 minutes.  Then it smelled like bleach.  It was a terrible dining experience.  We also spoke with the manager who was working & she stated she tried to call security earlier & they did not respond.  She offered no compensation for the terrible experience we had to endure.",

The omelets definitely satisfied (they were large enough for both me and the boy to take some home), with nice combinations of fillings, and the berry smoothie was a lovely morning pick me up.  I also indulged with the $3 Sunday morning mimosas, the proportion of OJ to champagne was perfect.    The only thing I left wanting was homefries small town diner style; cut potatoes cooked in a cast iron skillet with onions and seasonings.  These were the typical (fried?) cubes that the breakfast joints around here seem to love so much.    But, potatoes aside, we were pleased with our choices, and I forsee wandering back and sitting outside eating my brunch on a warm spring morning.  I like the atmosphere and the service is always beyond pleasant.",

I enjoy the salads. Love the smoothies and fresh squeezed juices. Sandwiches have been hit or miss. Sometimes the sammies have been bland and that's a statement for me because I usually feel food is over salted etc. I've had the plain fries twice and both times haven't been flavorless and cold. Soups are tasty but it lacks texture. The 4 times I've ordered the soup of the day- it's completely pureed like baby food. The most disappointing was this evening. I ordered a burger cooked medium. It was dry and over cooked, well done. I love my burgers still a little pink because that's where the flavor is to me. You overcook the meat and you lose the flavor and the juiciness. So I'm on the fence....",

    "text": "I haven't been into Rachel's Kitchen in a while. I remembered that they served smoothies and I had a craving for one. I arrived about 20 minutes before noon and it was only slightly busy.   I waited for the two cashiers to finish with their customers and then approached the young lady that was on the right register. She looked at me and then picked up the phone. The other cashier was still taking people's orders and I just stood there and waited. The young lady finished with the call and said to me pointing at the other cashier \"( insert cashiers name) will help you shortly.\" So I still waited. Then that cashier almost walked away, but he noticed I was a bit annoyed and asked to take my order. I already knew what I wanted which was a small Berry Mania Smoothie with whey protein.   So I sat and looked at my phone. Out of the corner of my eye I see someone start to make my smoothie. She had to exit the smoothie making area to the dining area several times to get ice and other things I wasn't sure. It just seems terribly inefficient. My smoothie took 15 minutes to make. That just seems crazy. Rachel's was kinda busy, but there was plenty of staff working.   Then when I actually got my smoothie it was bad. The whey protein was not mixed in at all and was gritty. For $7 I expected better.   It makes me really sad to write this review. I will go back for other things on their menu, but maybe just no smoothies. As for the experience with the staff hopefully they will get some better instruction or maybe just some people that show they care.",

Nothing in particular on the menu is necessarily any healthier than anywhere else, but the fact that they serve Acai bowls makes me feel like they MUST be better for me, right?  Service is fast and friendly, counter service.   The food is good, even if the portions are somewhat small. I do think the ingredients and preparation taste like they are higher quality, so I don't mind the smaller portion sizes.   They do have a rewards program (my favorite!) but you have to ask the cashier for some kind of card to sign up for the app, which I was too lazy to do. They should make their rewards program easier to sign up for.   The booths against the wall are terrible. If you sit in the booth, the table is way too far away from your mouth, and if you are spill-prone as I am, this is just an accident waiting to happen. On the other hand, the chairs paired with these booth tables are way too tall, so my thick-thighed boyfriend couldn't get his legs under the table. Switching seats didn't help, either, because the table was also close to the high booth seat.",

Pretty much your basic breakfast wrap. It tasted like something I could've made at home and save money.  The potatoes however were magical. Perfectly crispy and warm. I just wish the ketchup added something special, but nah it's just your good ol' basic ketchup.  I also had the juice Popeyes Special, which contained apples, spinach and other fruits/veggies, but it tasted like sweetened dirt. It wasn't pleasant to me at all. But if you're into wheat grass juices, you might enjoy it.  We ate outside because it was only 9:30AM but it started getting really hot. It would've been nice if there was mist or something to help cool the customers who want to eat outside. But maybe that's the District's problem and not Rachel's Kitchen.  Overall, I would probably come back to try other menu options because their menu is pretty big! Hopefully I will be more impressed next time.",

It was two slices of gluten free bread, a two egg white scramble with basil and tomatoes.   The acai bowl was not good. It was more like liquid than a solid. It tasted like banana more than acai. Also there is no gluten free granola so it was only acai/ banana liquid with a few strawberries. I wouldn't recommend getting it.   The watermelon juice was yummy and the hot tea was fine.   Overall, I like the place. It didn't knock my socks off for breakfast but they get major props for having delicious gluten free bread.

The nice november weather was perfect.  The restaurant inside was clean bytheway. Decor was simple but nice and welcoming. Staff we're all friendly. Great service actually.  I ordered a Tomato and Basil pasta which was good. The chicken soup with carrots and asparagus was also good. We also ordered a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries - it was so so but filling. And the chicken salad sandwich with onion rings was great!  I took advantage of the free wine offer when you check in on Yelp. I requested for a mimosa instead which our the cashier guy gladly worked out for me.  The ambiance, the food, the customer service is over-all 5 stars to me.  I want to come back and try their desserts and coffee... And maybe some smoothie too.",

They serve breakfast all day, have sandwiches, pastas, salads, coffee and MIMOSAS.  We ordered the chicken salad sandwich- 3/5 and the smoked turkey and avocado sandwich- 4/5. There was a huge amount of turkey in my sandwich! The chicken salad was boring. The smoked turkey had a nice slightly spicy kick to it.  They both came with a choice of sides- order the sweet potato fries over the plain fries.  Coffee was significantly cheaper than what it would be at Coffee Bean next door, but wasn't spectacular. However, the caffeine got the job done.  It's a cute place to go for breakfast/brunch and the walk around GVR is a nice way to let the food digest (Not that their meals are heavy or their portions very big!)",

The first time I had the cobb Salad (several months ago, back when gluten and dairy were part of my diet) It was delicious. I ate it out on the patio and enjoyed the nice April weather.   I ate here for a second time this weekend. I ordered the Angel Hair Bolognese with gluten free pasta. It is a homemade meat (beef only) sauce. It was really quite good. I also ordered the Malbec. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place offered wine. This time I sat at a table in the back and I was happy to find that they had a outlet near my table, excellent for charging my always dead phone.   So far both times I've come in alone... I think next time I'll bring my tablet and catch up on my book, rather than sit on FB/Yelp the whole time. ha.  I wish they had a few more gluten + dairy free choices... but I'm sure I'll be back soon.",

Plenty of salad for one meal - normally have enough for a snack later on. Good quality ingredients and for the price, you can't beat it!  I love sweet potato fries. I only allow myself fries twice a month, and one of those times is sometimes at Rachel's. The fries need a little more salt and seasoning, but they're crispy and not soggy which I love.   The menu has plenty of options for anyone who is indecisive but can't handle Cheesecake Factory sized menus. I normally get a quick basic turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich or one of their salads. Their dressings are great and don't taste like they're from the bottle at the grocery store. I heard they have delicious pasta too!  If you're gluten intolerant, they have gluten free pasta, bread, and plenty of options for you enjoy!",

Finally, when we sat down, there was hardly any seating and it was super cramped. It was a very uncomfortable experience all around. I may have gone at a bad time, but I personally didn't have a great time.  The only thing that's going for this place is the food. It seemed to be super healthy and it wasn't too bad tasting either. I got a breakfast burrito and it was actually a lot of food. I would say the food is the one good takeaway from this place.",

I've been to the Summerlin location and always received quality eats with great service.   This location is little different than the other spots since it's located in a shopping mall.  There's a wide variety of food from smoothies, oatmeals, sandwiches, and wraps. My usual order is their Smoked Avocado Turkey Sandwich and their PB Blast.  On this visit, I got their Turkey Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and their Peanut Butter Blast w/extra protein. The turkey burger wasn't as big as other joints, but was definitely tastier.  One thing about some turkey burgers is that they can get a little dry.  Rachel's is just perfect and almost taste like a real burger minus the high calories. My friend loves their Chicken Curry Sandwich and decided to change it to a wrap on this visit.  She killed it so I assume that was was good too.    One thing about this location is that it's a little busier than the Summerlin location.  This location has a different vibe, but still has the great service.  I love the Summerlin location and may be a little biased since that's the location that I frequent.  Overall, I'm still a fan of Rachel's and will continue to pay a visit when I'm in The District.",

My burger even came with a side of onion rings. I got three large rings: just enough to cure the craving without eating my suggested daily calorie intake in onion rings.   The menu was huge and there were lots of things I wanted to try. I'm so excited to go back and try one of the salads I saw being served to other customers. They looked delicious.",

Then I settled with a three-star because after tasting several of their food by munching off with my friends and my food.  I believe their food quality is mediocre and the price for the food, I believe is a little too over-priced.  I recently went to Rachel's Kitchen and ordered a Turkey Club Sandwich and the price was a little over $10 or $11.  For the taste of the food was not worth it.  I'd rather walk further and went to panera bread instead.    With that being said, I am no hurry to come back to Rachel's Kitchen, i would try other options first.    TIP: Check-in to rachel's kitchen and get $3 off mimosa on sundays :]",

It seems to be busy a lot so I figured it would be good, but I generally have always gone to Whole Foods when at the District because I didn't know that Rachel's had gluten-free bread.  We finally tried it and then I realized that they have a really healthy menu.  I love that I can have a sandwich there with no gluten.  They also have sweet potato fries which is great for those who eat paleo.  The food was good, they have a lot of choices and a lot of drinks and teas to chose from.  If you order a water bottle though, order the small one because the big one is like a 2 liter!  They also have TV's there that play sports, so you don't have to talk to your man while you are there, or you can just leave him there while you shop.  Really good though, you won't be disappointed.",

Yes, this place is a chain and inside an outdoor shopping mall (two things that are usually  deal breakers for me) but they have a good selection of food that seems fresh and was tasty.  I got the Wilshire smoothie and I tried some of my husband's Sunrise smoothie, they were both very good and made with fresh ingredients in front of us. Very tasty and refreshing, not watery at all like some places that use ice for filler.",

Why did she treat me this way I have no Idea.. Isnt my money as good as the next? Lady quit discriminating and get an attitude check!",

I had a really good turkey club sandwich with crispy bacon and avocado.  The mixed green side salad had a flavorful vinigarette.  The menu has a lot of healthy variety that includes breakfast, smoothies, sandwiches, pasta and salads.   The inside is small, but there are are also a handful of outside tables where you can do some nice people watching.

I decided to go with the \"440 Sandwich\" - I mean, you can't really go wrong with grilled chicken, goat cheese, avocado and red peppers, right? That was my thinking, anyways. The sandwich was good, but the goat cheese was the dominant flavor. I love goat cheese, so that was fine with me. The fries that came with my sandwich were pretty standard, but good.  My friend ordered the signature pasta, I think. I tasted a few bites and thought it was yummy. The tomato cream sauce could have maybe been a bit more tomato-y, but I still thought it was good.  The wine portions are tiny, so if you decide to drop $12 on a glass, just know you aren't going to get much of it.  If you live in the area, this would be a great place to go for lunch or dinner every once in awhile.",

I've tried the sweet potato fries, turkey burger, and chopped salad.  All were bad, especially the salad, which is basically just broccoli and garbanzo beans thrown in a food processor.  Only good thing is the cheap wine during happy hour.",

    "text": "Love the macaroni and cheese. Got some wine to go with it and the glass was small and not filled very full. On other visits I've ordered the french toast (yum!) and the breakfast burrito (meh..) I like that they have a flavored coffee, and the flavor is different every time and refills are free. Staff is friendly and service is usually pretty fast unless they are super busy. Seating inside is limited, but if the weather is cooperative it is great to enjoy the meal outside. The prices are a bit high for what you get, and some of the food is rather mediocre.",
