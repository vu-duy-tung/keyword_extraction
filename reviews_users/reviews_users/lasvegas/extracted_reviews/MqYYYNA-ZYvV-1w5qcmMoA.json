    "text": "My boyfriend and I live here in Vegas and had been wanting to try Aureole for a long time. We finally got the chance to go and were not disappointed!   He ordered a filet and I ordered the pork chop...to die for!! We ordered an appetizer of squash ravioli with duck confit that was amazing! Our sides of asparagus and mashed potatos were wonderful too...and the beginner bread basket is great.   The restaurant is known for its wine selection, so of course we had to try! The list is presented on a tablet that is hard to understand until the server helps you. Once we mastered the tablet and narrowed it down to about 10 Pinot Noirs, the head server Malik helped us select one that was FABULOUS. Since that dinner, we have actually ordered bottles of the same wine so we can always have it on hand!  Overall, wonderful dining experience. The staff is helpful and quick. Make sure to ask for Malik's section if you go in. He is very kind, funny, and helpful.",

Lamb, seafood, and some other very tasty items.  The service: Excellent, everything went very smooth, waiter was very friendly, maybe a bit chatty (I think he is opening his own restaurant in Peru?? sort of nice to know)  The atmosphere: Lives up to Vegas and Mandalay... Especially liked the wine tower with service people going up and down on ropes. Reminds me of Rum Jungle, which I guess has closed?? bummer on that.  The company (I know not in the control of Aureole mgmt.), but had to mention they were fantastic as well.  5 stars overall!",

FYI- we were at Encore Beah Club all day in a Cabana with 30+peeps watching World Cup so you can imagine the amoutn of alcohol in our system, not good for trying a top notch restaurant  People are right when they say the Wine tower is amazing...very dark and intimate setting and the plush booths were very comfortable  For the first course I had Charlie's Onion soup...hot, savory, delish  For the main course I had Pan Seared Filet Mignon, med-rare...amazing, amazing  For dessert we had the ice-cream trio, you can't go wrong with ice cream....  Waitstaff was very attentive and helpful....Again when going to a nice restaurant in vegas do not be like me and drink all day....does not pair well with fine cuisine!",

We started in the bar area for happy hour which was the best part of the meal. We both had a drink and one appetizer. We had the french onion soup and the sliders, both were great. After we went to the main dining room where we ordered the pork chops, some sort of seasoned fries (not sure what kind because they never came), and a caesar salad. The caesar salad was very marginal because they tried to make this salad \"fancy\" but it was really just a pain because they just put three lettuce leaves on a plate with a little dressing and some cheese... I just wanted a salad. Like I said, the fries never came out and he didn't even realize so I didn't say anything. The pork chop was a pork chop... nothing to get excited about. For desert we ordered the chocolate sampler which was so weird. It came with a chocolate mouse with popcorn in it which was not good at all, a chocolate cake pop which was so dry we couldn't eat it, and a little churro with chocolate dipping sauce which was good. Also, when we ordered the desert I ordered a coffee which came out after we had already eaten our desert so I sent it back. For as \"fancy\" and over priced this place is I expected a little more... at least try to remember to bring out the food I ordered?",

I have never had the pleasure of dining here but on a recent trip to Las Vegas with my sisters we did enjoy some wine and appetizers as an aperitif before dinner at Lupo. The cheese plate was absolutely lovely and the hummus was very good as well. We all enjoyed our wine selections and had a wonderful time except for the fact that the service was a bit brusque. I felt a little as though they were trying to turn the table, even though the bar area was less than half full and we did end up spending about $100 there.  Oh well, I can't help but give them four stars due to their impressive wine list (and even more impressive wine delivery system).",

We are all about the bar food - looked forward to hanging out in the Tower Lounge and watching the wine angels float up to the top to get that coveted bottle of wine.  So we get there at 9:15pm and were prompted seated in the Tower Lounge bar. Ordering wine is not the easiest thing to do in this place. With over 50,000 bottles or whatever they have, it's hard to figure out what to get. Plus, in our price range, I had no idea what would be better - the unoaked Chardonnay from Australia or the Sauvignon Blanc from Chile.  The waiter/maitre d' guy was no help so he sent over someone pretending to be a sommolier. When I asked what he thought of the unoaked Chardonnay, he replied \"Well, it's good. It's an unoaked Chardonnay so it will be less oaky.\" WTF?   Whatever, I ordered a bottle and we decided on a couple appetizers to start. But get this - the appetizers arrived before the wine did.  And I was barely finished eating when the busboy/annoying ahole picked the plate off the table. I am ALL for clearing the table after dinner, but come on...  The waiter dude didn't even ask if we enjoyed the wine or the food.  Then - at 9:50p, he drops the bill on our table and thanks us for coming. Really? We were in and out within 35 minutes? You have GOT to be KIDDING.  Wished I would have gone elsewhere. That was not the dining out experience we had hoped for.",

    "text": "What a terrible dining experience! My girlfriend and I decided to try this restaurant because we wanted to go to a nice restaurant for our anniversary, and because we are both wine lovers. When we were seated at our table our server came over and started speaking in Spanish to us. Neither of us are very fluent in Spanish, so we kindly asked him if he could speak to us in English. His reply was \"NO! You should know the language, so you must try\". First of all, I realize that I should know a second language, but a fine dining restaurant is not the venue in which I'd like to buff up on my Spanish skills.   Next came the wine . That was delicious, and the highlight of our experience.   When our entrees arrived, the server did not leave. He asked us about the wine in Spanish, and made us try to reply to him in Spanish. He said \"I'm not leaving until you say it correctly\". Then he asked us where we were from and we replied \"San Diego\". He wanted to know how long the drive was. Then then went on to say \"The reason I'm asking is because the girl that I was dating lived in San Diego, and we used to meet in Barstow or Victorville, get a hotel room, and then drive back our separate ways. Do you two think that I did the majority of the driving? It doesn't matter now though, she broke up with me...but whatever\" First of all, yes...you did do the majority of the driving. Second of all, I don't want to hear about your sexual escapades while I'm trying to eat my dinner (which by the way was a terrible overcooked piece of pork). Not worth the money.   Got back to the hotel after dinner, and about 4 hours later we were both very sick from the food and spent the rest of the night running to and from the bathroom. Take your money, and spend it elsewhere!",

    "text": "Though this restaurant appears on many \"best of\" lists for Vegas, I think Aureole is lucky Michelin stopped reviewing restaurants in Vegas in 2009. It's good - particularly the food, but it's impossible for me to overlook several missteps. For starters, our hostess was actually having a conversation on a Bluetooth as she seated us. Although we had reservations and it was so early that we were one of the first tables seated, we were not given a seating option with our table (maybe it would have been impossible without interrupting our hostess). We ended up in the Swan Court, which is nice, but it kills any chance to see the restaurant's famous \"wine angels\" in action. The waiter appeared shortly thereafter to take cocktail orders. I asked for a Hendrick's martini. He comes back in 15 seconds to say they have no Hendrick's... and suggests Absolut or Grey Goose as an alternative. Um, Forbes Four Diamond and the server doesn't know a proper martini is made with gin? Call me a snob, but that's bad. Once we sort out what a martini involves, lo and behold we find that they do have Hendrick's. The drink came out perfectly, but then the wine list showed up. Aureole cleverly puts their very impressive list on an iPad. The good part of that is the lack of pressure and ease of exploration. The bad part for us was the utter lack of attention from our server - he didn't ask what we liked to drink or planned to eat; in fact, he said nothing. Just the thunk of the iPad on the table. I suppose I expected a bit more, but we agreed upon a bottle and it was fine. Between the waiter and the hostess, I was starting to worry about the food, but the bread service started to allay those concerns. It was excellent, fresh and creative, which typified the rest of our meal. The service evened out and became passable, and w enjoyed a very reasonable prix fixe menu that was very well executed and satisfying. It was far from a perfect evening, however. If only the service matched the cuisine.",

Besides maybe New York there is no other city in the county that can rival Las Vegas in this regard. So, it figures that when it comes to going big in the arena of wine Las Vegas should know how to take care of business! And that is exactly what they have done with Aureole at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. A Charlie Palmer restaurant, Aureole is second to none in the \"Go Big\" with wine category. After all, the first thing you notice when walking across the elevated catwalk and down the stairs just to get into the restaurant is the four story high wine tower! This skyscraper-like structure measures 14 feet square and holds approximately 9,865 bottles. And just to throw in a little Vegas theatrics they hoist \"wine angels\" up and down the tower plucking bottles of wine out of the sky for the enjoyment of their dinner guests. And if the larger than life wine tower weren't enough to catch your eye, then the digital wine list is sure to keep you captivated for hours on end. Search threw thousands of bottles within minutes by making a few quick taps to the screen on one of many Tablet PC's turned wine list floating around the dining room. Feel free to place your order digitally or maybe drop an email to the house. This compact machine is loaded with all kinds of techno-wine wizardry that could only be found in one place - Las Vegas baby!",

He was very enthusiastic about allowing our table of 3 taste any wine we desired. And the \"taste\" was more like a glass too. i got to try wines from Argentina, California, Austria, Spain... It was great! He warned me that the entrees are not the best deal here, so instead I got 3 appetizers: the tuna canneloni, the louis salad, and the rock shrimp ravioli. All were executed PERFECTLY, both in taste and presentation. I originally ordered the squab on risotto, which was not at all what i expected. It was very rare, VERY gamey tasting, and had no skin. I sent it back with no problem and got the louis salad instead, which was 80% crab - YUM, my kind of salad. I got the opportunity to meet the chef and see the kitchen here, who was very gracious, even though I had criticized his squab. Seeing the kitchen was AWESOME. It is huge and there is staff everywhere. Very clean too. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking to have a memorable experience, especially if you love wine as much as I do! The restaurant is beautiful, the wine tower is impressive, and the service is impeccable. It was the BEST SERVICE I had in Vegas all week, and I went to a lot of other high end restaurants. However, be prepared to spend some money here! Including a generous tip, 3 appetizers and a glass of wine was $90.",

    "text": "The geek and wine-lover in me adores this place:  They have a really extensive wine list, and best of all, they bring you a Tablet PC to use to find the wine that you want.  You can sort by any category, year, country, grape, etc.  if you order an expensive enough of a bottle, a \"Wine Angel\" repels down the side of the wine tower to bring your bottle.  Really cool.  Unfortunately, the $120 bottle we ordered wasn't enough to warrant any Wine Angel time. :)  We came here rather late and decided to crash at the seating near the bar area.  Along with our wine we ordered off of the appetizer menu, but the food was quite good.  The rest of the menu looked a lot more expensive, but we were quite satisfied with the bar menu and walked out only $200 poorer including wine, tax, and tip.",

    "text": "I really debated on the rating for Aureole.  We ate there right after arriving in Las Vegas for a week long stay at Mandalay Bay.  I was there on business but my husband joined me to combine a little bit of pleasure with the business.  I was really looking forward to Aureole after hearing so much about it.  I will start by saying our food was fabulous and that is of course the most important aspect of any restaurant experience.  Service was also very good.  My pomegranate martini was one of the best that I have ever had.  What was a little disappointing was the stark nature of the restaurant.  I think one problem is that  due to the 3 hour time difference from the east coast, we were there early by Vegas standards, around 6 pm  Wall are all white with no artwork or anything to speak of.  Maybe when it is dark the wine tower takes center stage but in the bright light it was really not as impressive as others have stated and we really only saw one flight up the tower during our entire meal.  I was also a bit shocked to see what appeared to be a curtained area used for waiters etc to serve from.  It just appeared kind of flimsy, like something you would see at a large banquet hall.  It was one of those rare dining experiences where the lack of ambiance took away from an otherwise great meal and if anything I had expected the opposite situation.",

    "text": "had dinner at aurole tonight. we were fascinated by the wine \"cellar\" and decided we HAD to order off the electronic wine list-- we wanted to see the ladies in calvin klein tights suspending to get our wine. the wines on the list range from reasonable to jaw dropping. our wine appeared without having to go into the cellar. what?! while drinking our wine, though, we saw them retrieve several bottles. first, the decor is totally breath taking. the floral scent of the restaurant was welcoming without being overpowering. the waitstaff was very accommodating, they allowed us to order several things that we liked off the tasting menu without ordering the full menu, since there were some courses that we did not want. the bread basket was very good. i wish the bread was warm and i wish that they would put some creativity in their butter.  it was just 2 pieces of butter in a dish. it wasnt whipped, or flavored or anything. our meals: i ordered: octopus and  palm salad- kind of disjointed. there were also potatoes and eggplant in this salad, and eaten separately were good, but as a cohesive dish, it was just weird. octopus was cooked well. ny strip loin: i usually order my steaks medium, and this was rather over done and chewy. my bf thought mine was better than his. so i am happy he was able to eat it. he ordered: cajun hanger steak- cooked just as ordered. very good. i loved the corn mixture it was sitting on. we both ordered the bananas foster parfait. good, but not great. the little donuts that came with it was rather dense for a dessert. there was a  photographer there asking to take our picture. thought it was going to be one picture, but she asked us to pose for 5 pictures while giving specific directions, \"put your arm around her, hold her hand, kiss (but look natural), cheek to cheek\" i was thinking, what did i get us into. by the end of the dinner, she came by with our pictures in a portfolio, and i decided that i did not want them-- they were also $125! she looked annoyed and just walked off, and was standoffish for the rest of the time we were there. that kind of soured our experience. i am sorry, but you cant expect to sell every picture that you take, and you shouldnt make your customers feel guilty for not buying them. overall, the experience was good, however, if i did not have the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, we prob will not go back. the food was not spectacular for the cost, though the service was great.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I wandered spontaneously into this restaurant at 9 pm on a Saturday night, following a show, and to our surprise, there were plenty of open tables. The decor is lovely, though it is on the verge of looking dated. The service, while thorough, was slow as molasses, but as I'd read the Yelp reviews before, I knew to expect this. That said, we never felt rushed, and ultimately got everything we needed. We scanned the menu and decided on the \"chef's harvest menu\" (I think that's what it was called?) which was a 3-course prix fixe menu of seasonal ingredients, costing $65. We weren't that hungry and we asked them if we could split it, and they generously obliged, even going so far as to plate the split portions separately without charging us a penny. We started with the arugula, strawberry, and rhubarb salad, which was delicious. We then had the halibut with risotto and some other delicious sides I can't recall. I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend loved it. My issue was that I had been completely ruined for Halibut by the Black Mountain Grill, who served me the most perfectly cooked piece of Halibut I've had in recent memory last week, so I was tough to impress. We finished with a chocolate spearmint bar topped with housemade whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, served with a tray of 5 housemade confections that I think comes with every meal. It was tasty, but forgettable. All of this was accompanied by a generously poured $20 glass of Grappa, by far the best Grappa I've ever had, and well worth the price tag. (Though we split this, as neither of us wanted a whole glass). Overall it was a good value - we were stuffed, even having split a meal, and the tab was under $100. This is one of those times where I wish there was a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, because Aureole is better than 3 stars but not quite up to 4. I didn't find it overpriced at all and it was good value for the food, ambiance, plating and service. However, there is certainly better food in Vegas.",

They changed everything up, had MGM go cheap and push them around and ended up killing the restaurant. Well played.  I have dinned with them a bunch of times since the changes and it has really gone down hill, and with the bad kitchen performance you can tell the staff is demoralized. Food is uninspiring, cutting corner on food costs/portion size, and no attention to detail. The saving grace is Sal, David, and Kyran who are still providing exemplary service.  I still go to drink wine and order carefully (cheese plate, onion soup:Charlie recipe,etc.) as a pre-game or to meet before I take clients elsewhere. I hope they give back to Charlie free reign to fix the place or just let it go out to pasture under MGM.",

Worst spaghetti of my life.  But the funniest part was the customer service. I feel bad writing this review because the majority of staff and aesthetics was great. Of course, it only takes one terrible waiter or waitress to ruin everything. Gosh this waiter though... He just seemed to have a bad day, which is normal. We all get bad days. He comes over and just looks at us with this expression that reads \"wtf do you want\". My friend and I are just sitting there and I start smiling because it's literally this awkward pause of staring. My friend commented that it was like his first day or something. I think it's because he was having a bad day and took it out on customers. I was observing the other guest and you can just tell by their expression that they weren't having it with him either. I would expect this kind of service from a lousy restaurant but an up scale dining? I'm sorry but that's funny.",

To start we had the beef and octopus carpaccio, bacon wrapped pork belly, and lion fish ceviche. All were delicious and very unique! The bacon wrapped pork belly came with a sunny side egg that was cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Alfredo, helped with wine selections for every course. For dinner I had the Alaskan Halibut while my boyfriend ordered the cut of the week which was a NY Strip. We ordered a side of mac & cheese and the mushrooms for the table.  I absolutely loved my entree. It was cooked perfectly and the tartar mashed potatoes were a perfect compliment to the fish. My boyfriend had ordered his steak medium rare - and him being a chef he's very picky - the steak came slightly overcooked. When brought to our waiters attention he offered to have it re-fired for us but did say it would be a moment or two, we decided not to wait and because of this Alfredo offered to take care of our desserts for us. About half way through our entrees a party was seated close to us that had a loud and fussy baby. The table next to us had already moved to get away from the noise and we were close to follow. Alfredo moved us to a table away from the loudness and brought over all of our dishes and drinks. He was more than accommodating which was very nice! For dessert we had the mango sundae, the cold pressed coffee panna cotta and the trio of cheesecakes. All were delicious! Beware though - when ordering the cheesecake it is not traditional cheesecake which was well explained to us by our waiter. One slice is brie cheese, the others cheddar and blue cheeses. All were delicious to us but definitely not for everyone I'm sure so be wary. All over a great experience! Alfredo was very attentive and we never felt like we had to track someone down for help. Our glasses were never empty and empty dishes weren't left at our table for too long between courses which was amazing! Two thumbs up for sure!",

The food was less than fine.  The worst course was foie gras served with a fruity syrup that reminded me of IHOP.  There was a sugary pastry with it like a small chunk of funnel cake. There was also something very off about the texture of the foie gras.  My wife refused to eat hers.  There was a salmon rillette that could be characterized as salty fish paste on stale bread.  Other courses were pretty decent.  There was a duck cavatelli and a cod dish that were Ok.    Desert was cheesecake three ways.  One was a blue cheese cheesecake that was pretty interesting.  The other two were unremarkable.  We were glad to have seen this place but wouldn't recommend it to others.  The food was just not very good.",

They have a decent selection of $6 wines (red, white, and featured sparkling), hard liquors including scotch and whiskey, and cocktails.

The food all around was great ($6 small plates). My favorite was the Italian sausage which just melted in your mouth and the Caesar Salad which was simple but refreshing and delicious...but you really couldn't go wrong with anything.",

We got the Fritto Misto and the bacon wrapped sliders - don't skip either! Awesome opportunity to eat at a Michelin starred restaurant at a reasonable price during happy hour. On top of that - the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. Thanks Donald for a great experience!",

    "text": "My husband secured us a reservation here for my first trip to Vegas. We loved the concept of the \"wine Angels\" and thought we'd be treated to an amazing meal with a warm atmosphere given the other reviews on Yelp.   Boy were we wrong.   After being seated at our table my husband pointed at the wine vault. I turned around to attempt to see and noticed the glass divider behind me was frosted. I was unable to view anything going on with the wine vault. Also, the tables are not centered around it as we both assumed they'd be (and we all know what happens when one assumes....)   Okay, so it wasn't centered around gravity defying, wine grabbing ladies. No biggie. They must have a great selection of wine, right?! That they do BUT they present it in an iPad from 2004 judging from its weight. Okay...progressive people, I'm cool with that! Except the list is broken down into such minute categories with no way to view them all at once. Want a wine from France? Better know what region it comes from! You also better be prepared to sift through eight regions broken down by grape TYPE.   After being greeted by the sommelier who did nothing to help us (\"oh, it's hard to browse the menu? Take a few more minutes then to decide. I'm not going to offer any suggestions cause that's not my job\" *leaves table*) we were greeted by our (what I can only assume was our arrogant waiter) who read the menu to us and then (literally) tossed the menu back in front of me and walked off. No suggestions, no asking if we needed anything...nada. Dude walked off like he had just done us a favor. Cause we can't read. Ugh.   The only redeeming thing that night was the very nice GM who asked us our opinion of the new wine menu. We actually booked a reservation at Veranda at the Four Seasons while sitting here. After leaving before ordering (something I have never done!) we had an AMAZING meal at Veranda!!",

As I was on my own I enjoyed a single glass of red wine - Loring 'Mateo' a 2014 Pinot Noir from Santa Rita Hills. Great food memories and I have already recommended the restaurant and experience to others.    The 4 storey red wine tower was incredible. It was great to see the silver clad 'wine angel' scale up and retrieve a bottle of wine. A truly unique experience. My hostess and waiter were very friendly and knowledgeable. Service was excellent and the timing of the drinks and each food course was perfect.   My dining experience was also very memorable as the chef came out to meet me personally after I asked for his Caesar salad recipe. He took the time to meet me and provided his business card. I emailed him for the recipe and he was kind enough to send me the recipe the very next day. Thanks so much to the chef for a great meal and thanks to everyone for a great dining experience.",

At first glance the menu looks uninspired - think circa 2000, but well intentioned.  The food was just awful. The Chilean sea bass was so tough that you couldn't even cut it. The Brussels were steamed and covered in butter - okay, but not for $20.  My friend's salmon was not well cooked and was clearly frozen, thawed, and maybe frozen again.  Som was helpful and friendly and the wine was fine.  We had cocktails too, and they were alright.  Recommend skipping this place and watching the wine angels from the casino floor - more impressive view anyway from that level.  I am sad that I spent so much money on this sub par dinner.

We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing. The portions and timing of the service was perfect.

    "text": "The flagship restaurant of the Mandalay Hotel and Casino, Aureole is architectural and design wonder.  The sleek open space is punctuated by the 3 story wine tower, home to nearly 10,000 bottles  (a fifth of their overall inventory).  This version of Aureole is far different from the small, intimate original in Manhattan's Upper East side, but in Vegas, bigger is better.  Visuals are great and all, but how is the food?  Excellent.  Chef Charlie Palmer's \"progressive American\" focuses on dishes of high-quality ingredients simply prepared and presented.  The menu is straightforward, either choose the 3 course prix fixe or the 7 course \"Celebration of Great American Food\" tasting menu.  Selections are mostly seasonal, although consistent on the menu are the \"Peking\" duck and Colorado lamb, both very good.  Aureole is home to one of the largest and diverse wine lists one will ever see.  Over 2,000 selections and 50,000 total bottles, the list is presented electronically on a wireless tablet PC.  There is an initial \"wow, this is cool\" upon seeing this, in practice it would be best to have a good ol' analog (paper) wine list.  Although I am usually too proud to ask for help selecting a bottle, there is simply too man options here.  The sommeliers are incredibly knowledgeable, and I suppose they had better be with an inventory such as this.  I would prefer to see a better by-the-glass list.  Unless you get the 7 course meal, with the wine pairings, your single serving options are rather limited.",

Saturday night our party of 8 get to what we thought would be a fabulous dinner. We are taken to our table and are rudely greeted by our waiter. He quickly tells us about their wines and walks away. We flag him down and ask for the sommelier. Our waiter comes back after several minutes and takes our drink order. Drinks were great but after waiting 30 minutes we realize we hadn't seen our waiter since our drink order! I called over someone and ask if we could get a waiter to our table. He said yes but 10 minutes later we had to ask again!! Finally, another guy who wasn't our original waiter come over and took our order. (We all ordered the 4 coarse Parallel Tasting) Talk about an overpriced disaster! I don't want to sound like a spoiled brat but if I'm paying $$$$ then I expect really good service. In my experiences of highly rated, high class restaurants they usually tell you what is on the plate. Here, they did not do that. The food we had was quite good.  Im only giving this place a 1 star because I have to. The Sommelier was extremely friendly and very helpful. The food was really good but with such low quality of service it really left a bad taste in my mouth. (yes, that is what she said)  I was so excited to try this place but I will never go back.",

    "text": "This rating is based on a dinner visit.  Atmosphere - 4.5:  Entry into the restaurant features a stroll down the staircase around the glass wine tower, which is something that sets Aureole apart from the crowd.  There are two seating choices, the main dining room and the Swan Court.  We chose the Swan Court which was more private, quiet, and romantic.  The room overlooks a pond that has curious swans swimming about that seemed interested in checking us out.  The only downside to the Swan Court is that there is no view of the Wine Angels flying about in the wine tower to retrieve your special bottle of Vino.   Menu - 4:  You have two options for the menu: 1. A fixed \"Parallel\" menu with two selections for each course.  The Parallel menu is a tasting menu where the selections aren't choices, but both course items are served together, in parallel.  This option can only be selected if the entire table is willing to go with this choice.  2. Select from a traditional style menu with a variety of appetizers, main courses, and sides.  We went with the fixed menu because we loved being able to sample a wide variety of dishes. Either option offered diverse selections.  Service - 5:  The is a Four Diamond restaurant so our expectations were fairly high, but Aureole did not disappoint.  Service was fantastic from the moment we entered right up until we left.  My wife has some food allergies and the staff did a phenomenal job accommodating her and modifying some of the dish preparations.    Food - 5:  Outstanding!  Everything was prepared to perfection.  The dishes were creative both from a culinary and visual perspective.  Wine List - 5:  In a word, WOW!  The wine list is on a tablet computer that you can search, sort,  and filter on various criteria (region, vintage, type etc.) to find what suits you.  It's a good thing too, because they have an unbelievable selection.  It's obvious why they have won the Wine Spectator Grand Award every year since 1999.  The sommelier knew the collection very well and and helped us pick out some amazing bottles.  I was blown away.   Overall - 5",

We look at each other and laugh, as we are some of the few patrons left. The giggles have taken over and our voices are nowhere to be found.  The menu is lovely as we get to pick one appetizer and entree each for a fixed price. I was in the mood for beef and a delicious glass of Cabernet. I selected the cheese plate and my friend wanted the French Onion Soup. We each choose wine, she is always about the Sauvignon Blanc especially if they are from New Zealand. On the other hand I spotted a glass of Cabernet from Hess Winery and knew that would be mine for the evening.  Appetizers and wine are served and we can't keep track of all the different guys that are serving us. We just can't stop laughing about our weekend and our recaps. We scanned pictures and videos and ate our cheese (all nice selections were yummy) spilled the soup on the white linen.  Our entrees finally arrive; I picked the Blue cheese crusted fillet. Cooked to perfection (medium-rare, more rare than medium) all I remember was just how succulent each bite was. We both couldn't stop laughing with what little sound would come out.  Food, wine and a spectacular friend of mine, the best ending to Vegas and an amazing UnCorked weekend.

It seems like everything here is a feast for the eyes. From taking in the view of their waterfall-fountain scene, to their breath-taking and somewhat scary wine tower. Staff actually have to be on \"rock-climbing\" line and hook to retrieve your beloved bottle of wine.  I can say that only MOST of the staff were top notch. Our waiter was very helpful in all dinner decisions and was very attentive to all our needs. The host/cashier was very snobby and stuck-up, that's the last kind of service you want when you're spending $95 per person for dinner. They lost a star for that :( Sorry!  We had the 4 course Tasting Menu seated in the Swan Court. It was a spetacular view and very romantic lighting. ($95/per person)  Onto the food, we loved the presentations of all courses! Everything was served in the appropriate temperature and tasted superb! We even loved the choice of breads, my favorite was the caramelized onion bread! YUMMY!!! The waiter was even nice enough to pack some \"to-go\" for me.   For the starter plate, I had Lobster Egg Roll, Ahi Tuna, and some sort of Sweet Potato Puree. They were pleasing, but we definitely wanted more bites of it!  Second Course we had Scallops with Crusted Mushrooms and Lamb Lollipops with Pearl Potatoes. The Scallops were very sweet, in a good way and the Lamb had a little too much fat  and au jus.  Third Course I had the Steak Three-Ways, Kobe Beef, New York Strip Steak (medium-rare), and Filet Mignon. My favorite was the New York steak which was served in a fantastic red wine reduction and complimented it very well. The scallion potatoes that they were on the bottom sucked up all the juices from the meats and was also very tasty!  Last but not least, the Fourth Course we had the dessert sample with Creme Brulee, Cheese Stuffed Fig, Almond and Grape Biscotti, Toasted Walnut Cake with Hazelnut Caramel, and of course, the house-made chocolates!!!!! They were all very sweet and we were glad it was in small portion/bites because of the large sugar intake :)  We loved our meal and experience here. We were basically swept off our feet in the most luscious, luxurious, and EXPENSIVE way possible, but it was worth it!",

    "text": "I thought I reviewed this two months ago but better late than never right? Came here for a Valentine's dinner (yes, I'm 3 months late).  Decor: Modern, clean, sleek. Depending on how you view it, it can work for as a great date place or a good business dinner.   Food: The food was good but not amazing. The portions were pretty generous though. And I don't know if it was by mistake or because they had too much food but we ended up getting more dishes than we ordered--on the house. It was a nice gesture but I was completely stuffed before our entrees even came out.  Spicy coconut lemon grass broth - I'm not a fan of spicy but it was a light way to start the meal.  Spinach composition of ahi tuna and alaskan crab - yummy! But I'm a big fan of seafood and tartar so this was going to be delicious to me by default.  Seared foie gras - I love foie gras and while this one tasted good, I've had better. But still good nonetheless Housed cured salmon - Another light way to start the meal, delicious.  Hand cut fettuccine de mare - Good but a bit on the heavy side for an appetizer. Who starts with pasta as an appetizer? This is probably what made me full--not to mention they gave us huge portions of this.  Beef wellington - A LOT of meat to eat. Either I was too full by this point or I just wasn't feeling it.  Pancetta wrapped monkfish - This was good too but another heavy entree. This probably could have filled me up all on its own. The fish was cooked nice though.  Chocolate raspberry bar - A slightly heavier way to finish off the meal (by this point, I was ready to throw up because I was so full)  They also gave complimentary chocolate bars courtesy of.....some dessert chef. Truffle chocolates were delicious.   Service: A little slow but it was Valentine's and it was crowded. Our reservation wasn't until 9PM so I was surprised at how long our meal took (we ended up leaving right before midnight) but everyone working was hustling that night so I'm just going to assume there were way too many people that night.",

I need to start this review by saying we experienced exceptional service. The service alone was so amazing that it could make me come back. This was an extravagant meal so I don't say that lightly. Warm, friendly, knowledgable staff that were perfect over several hours. There is also a Lego model design of the wine tower that was completely charming. I thought it was all very lovely but sadly the food did not live up to the rest of the experience. My duck was so over cooked, I was shocked. I've never once received a well done duck breast in a restaurant and I certainly didn't think I'd see it here. It was very chewy and under seasoned and unfortunately my husband had the same experience with his steak. It was marginal, the highlight of his meal was his side of mashed potatoes. I did taste them and they were great, the mushrooms were also fantastic, I'd recommend them both. While my duck breast was a huge disappointment my confit was great, again, drier than I'd expect but it was wrapped in a nice buttery pastry that balanced that very well. My salad was nothing to really mention, neither good nor bad. Honestly the highlight of the meal for me was the sorbet. It was a fun little assortment of nine different flavors. I wanted to love this place, but the food was average at best.",

The \"signature cocktail\" was gross don't order it, nasty. The service was bad. It took a half hour to get water, then a half hour to get drinks, then a half hour to get the first course, ect. The meal was nothing but took hours to serve.   The wine served was vinegar, but they did provide the new glasses of wine. They asked in a condescending way if we would prefer a \"different wine\", to which I replied \"just make sure its not vinegar\".    The food was mediocre at best. Very very disappointing. Save your money and go to a slot machine, at least you know your going to get ripped off. Perhaps this was an off night, but when the front desk was confronted they said \" talk to the management\", translation \"Do I look like I care?\". They didn't seam to care.",

There is a three-story tower acting as their wine rack/cellar and i would hate to know the price of the bottles at the top. There is an acrobatic show whenever someone orders a bottle from that rack. Interesting. I know that its claim is the wine, but the beer selection was horrible. Did not eat there, but have heard decent things. Careful of the price.",

All three of us were blown away by this meal.  Comments you would hear during the meal from each of us include \"This is the single best bite of pasta I have ever had\", \"The octopus is the most expertly cooked octopus I've had in years.\", \"The orange mousse is the most surprisingly good dessert, I can't stop eating it.\"   My personal favorite bites of the night were the lobster ravioli, pork belly pasta, goat cheesecake, and that caramel mousse!  An absolute 5 start dining experience.   No culinary stone was left unturned and they mailed every dish with delightful perfection.  Can't wait to return!",

    "text": "First of all, the Blue Lizard Farms Baby Greens does not come with an actual lizard as part of the meal.  I asked.  tldr: Eh.  It's good but not great.  I can't decide whether to give them a 3 or a 4.  Definitely not getting a 5.  I expected a little more from a Michelin star.  I've had better dinners at Vegas restaurants without a Michelin star.  We had: Apps: Short rib rav: Very good.  4 raviolis.    Calamari: It was good but needed more aioli.  It was just a light squirt around the bottom of the plate.  You end up with some with a fair amount on them and some with none on them, and I want to taste the aioli.  If they think providing a ramekin with aioli on the side is gauche then they need to use a bit more on the plate IMO.  Or just give me the ramekin and let me dunk those mothers to my hearts content.  Sides: Mushrooms: These were great.  Nice variety and great flavor.  Maybe coulda been sauteed a little harder but I'm not really complaining.  Brussel sprouts: I liked em quite a bit but the spouse wasn't a big fan despite loving veggies in general and sprouts in particular.  Mains: Filet: It was great but not amazing.  Cooked to the proper temp.  Maybe could have used a bit more sear.    Frutti di mare risotto: I loved it but I also wonder if people might think it was a little too rich, lotta cream and fat for a risotto.  Might be great for an app, to be honest, split between 4 people.  Definitely a solid amount of seafood.  Service: First off, I hate \"over service\" more than under.  Like if you've got 3 different people asking me how my meal is every 4 minutes, I'm gonna get pissed.  If you're topping my water off when it's 70% full over and over, I'm gonna get pissed.  If you ask to clear my plate when there's still half a shrimp on it, not only am I gonna get pissed, I might punch you in the dilz.    But I don't like having an empty water glass for more than 3 seconds either, and for ~$300+ for two people at a Michelin starred restaurant that shouldn't happen either.  Aureole was closer to the latter than the former.  It wasn't to the extent I would call it bad service, but it wasn't perfect service by any means.  So I guess that tips me over to 3 stars.",

Unfortunately, we came here late on a Tuesday pm after seeing KA at the MGM Grand...and apparently no one needed bottles of wine.  The wall o' wine is very impressive to see, however...  You will spend a pretty penny here, but all and all it was worth it.  It's very clean, the service is outstanding and the food was delicious!  I ordered a chef special caprese salad and the blue crusted filet for my dinner.  I can't recall the name of our dessert but they set it on fire before we ate it... it was something fancy schmancy.  I thought for sure wine would be on the expensive side here but it wasn't too bad compared to $18 for the cheapest glass of wine at Tom Collichio's Heritage Steakhouse, where we at at a few nights before.    We didn't have a reservation but the place was pretty empty when we arrived after 9 so it wasn't so bad.  The lounge has a pretty decent late night happy hour... given one of the people in our party was sick and wasn't feeling a full meal, we probably should have opted for that but overall this was a nice experience.",

My BF is not a big food guy so he just ordered a BORING steak, granted delicious, but boring.  OMG, I had real truffles.   Not truffle oil and not truffle oil sprinkled on fries, I had REAL black truffles.  Sorry, feeling a little low class right now but I don't care.  Each dish was more amazing than the last.  It's pretty pointless for me to go into detail about what I had exactly because the menu has probably since changed, but know that everything was cooked perfectly and the flavors were amazing!  I don't think this is a good place for a regular ole chum to take a girl on a first date.  She might get the wrong idea and expect it every time, hehe.  The total tab for two with tax and tip came to approximately $250.",

They did not have in stock the only nonalcoholic beer advertised on their happy hour. They said it was going to be coming shortly and did my guest want something else in the meantime. He ordered a ginger ale and they charged us full price for it - above the price of a beer. Weird. The French onion soup was so-so, as were the ribs. But the tiny sliders were awesome, as was the cheese plate.  The second visit was for a company party and it was excellent. Same cheese plate, but enormous party size. Same burgers, less toppings.  If I could do 3.5 stars, I would",

Everything was light and fresh, the flavors all came through so well, nothing was overpowering. The plates were beautiful just like the atmosphere. For dessert we had a cheesecake trio which included a blue cheese cheesecake! So interesting and different, still had the richness of cheesecake but also the tangy blue cheese flavor! Amazing experience, definitely recommend and will be back!",

The restaurant is visually amazing, just gorgeous, and huge.... In the center is the most stunning three story wine display with women propelling themselves up and down on wire to retrieve a particular selection of wine, a quite beautiful performance if you ask me... The dinner however, not such a beautiful performance...... We started with the hummus plate, hummus, baba ganoush & tzatziki with flat bread. This was really really bad! I love a good spicy hummus and love love love baby ganoush, this was really one of the worst I have ever had, the bread was hard and dry... absolutely previously frozen. The Black Garlic Caesar Salad was good, and the Parmesan, Poppy Seed Tuille was tasty. The Lion Fish Ceviche was okay..... really just okay... not fresh,  nothing special at all.  The Ribeye Cap was absolutely not worth the price and very disappointing for a major Las Vegas Strip restaurant.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries tasted good but were just tiny broken pieces of fries, not a single one more than an inch in length, just crumbs....... Service was outstanding, they were attentive and aware, but the real utter disappointment in the food quality was so bad, I know why there was ample seating available on such a busy night.",

We are all in the industry and had big hopes for tonight    Dinner started out ok, our group of 9 was excited to try a lot of different things. Orlando was our server as well as another gentleman that didn't introduce himself. At the beginning of our meal and when we were ordering cocktails we told the unnamed gentleman that we were going to need separate checks. He said \"that's fine we will figure it all out later\" ok cool, no issue. We spent the rest of our meal laughing & enjoying the food, some of it was meh some of it was AMAZING.. I ordered the grilled calamari, not my favorite, kinda bland, the hummus trio was ok, the cod was delicious, the beef cheek ravioli was boring. The carpaccio was outstanding.. eventually we ordered dessert, two of our friends left for about 15 mins and when they came back we waited another 15 mins for our desserts, they were good but not out of this world..   check time.. Orlando had us all on one check.. and separating it was a complete shock to him and instead of being professional about it, he made us feel like a major inconvenience. We explained how we wanted it and how we had previously asked for separate checks but that went unnoticed. We waited over 20 minutes for him to figure out everything and separate everything. My one friend was given the incorrect bill multiple times and his card charged multiple times and thats just ridiculous. There were multiple people helping process payments, but Orlandos partner from the beginning of the meal was no where to be found. It was beyond frustrating!  We were really looking forward to this dinner and have had this reservation made for over 3 months and it was so disappointing that the experience was ruined by lack of communication between staff..",

A server, a sommelier, a busboy, a food server, and even the restaurant manager came by to ask if we were doing ok.   The prefixe menu had 4 courses:  Appetizer: oyster Rockefeller and clams casino -delicious but so small  Creme brulee foe grais: sounds weird but the pairing of the sweet creme brulee and the rich salta for grais was pretty amazing   Main entree: veal with vegetables  -sad to say this was actually the weakest part of the meal. It was good but not amazing and the veal was pretty fatty.   Dessert was amazing to see! We got 3 small bites presented to us: a white chocolate pop rock truffle, white cake, and rose water sorbet.

The waiter did have the restaurant week menu neatly designed in its own casing, but insisted on reviewing the regular menu first.  He seemed annoyed when Blair asked for the other menu, and said he had to tell us about the real one first.  We actually had 2 waiters, and the other one (tall and handsome) was the guy who checked on us, our drinks and our food most of the time.  I ordered the frisee salad with poached egg, foie gras and figs for my first course.  Blair got the braised octopus and Maine lobster salad.  We definitely nibbled at each others.  I was very pleased with this course since it has everything great in it (and frisee is my favorite lettuce!)  Next, I got the crispy duck leg confit with greens, super thin potatoes and ice wine reduction.  Blair ordered the braised short rib and seared togarashi tuna loin with broccoli puree.  We agreed the tuna was blah, but the duck and beef shined.  I also liked the veggies on my plate.  We ended up both getting the peach brown butter tart for dessert and the peaches were good but the tart a bit dry.  They bring itty bitty petit fours at the end and I tried all of them!  We also tried to get the wine pairing mentioned on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthreesquare.org&s=3b73dfe2c153c3e7d10cdcb0532e09eb49eea97767441c6fb9058d839257e504\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">threesquare.org</a>.  The waiter taking our orders said the wine pairing was mistakenly put on there but charities do not allow alcohol to be advertised or some BS.  Blair pulled up the web site on her iPhone but he said pairing the wines listed would cost us up to $80 each instead of $10 or $20 extra!  We ended up getting wine flights for $14-16 each, a better deal and plenty for me.  I had the aromatic white (the RIesling was amazingly fruity but dry) and Blair enjoyed the ripe soft red and especially the Grenache.  I also indulged in enough pretzel rolls for both of us since she is low-carbing it.  After all of this indulgence we went to Wet Your Appetite at Wet Republic!  It was a great night of food debauchery!",

Aureole-Dinner $50.10 Address: 3950 Las Vegas Blvd South Las Vegas, NV 89119 Phone: 702 632-7401 Website: Link to Website Reservations: Click for Reservations Donor Level:  Dinner: Gold Plate Dinner  -- $50.10 --  First Course Frisee Salad \"Gourmande\"  Foie gras torchon, poached egg, black mission figs  Or  Braised Octopus and Maine Lobster Salad  Warm pewee potato, tarragon vinaigrette  Second Course Crispy Duck Leg Confit  Lyonnaise potatoes, wilted greens, ice wine reduction  Or  Beef Short Rib and Togarashi dusted Ahi Tuna Loin  Broccoli puree, sauteed porcini mushrooms, hand rolled potato gnocchi  Third Course Late Summer Peach Brown Butter Tart  Peach buttermilk sherbet, amaretto anglaise  Or  Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar  Candied peanuts, honey caramel sauce   These were the choices!  My bf and I usually wont' get the same stuff so we can pick at each other's yummy food.  The 1st course was good because it was just so...so.so..I don't know how to describe it.  DIFFERENT? lol. It was honestly good.  Well for my taste buds. I had the 1st choice and never had poached eggs on a salad before.  Luckily I love eggs so I was down.  Just so many different flavors.  The only thing I didn't like was my dessert.  The peach brown butter tart was okay. I got tired of it after a little while.  It seemed \"bready\"?  The sherbert was a little tart.  I had to close my eyes when I put it in my mouth.  hahahahha.  Other than that I would love love to go back to Aureole!  OH P.S.  They had awesome BAR FOOD!!!!  When we walked in there were hella people at the bar.  They called it \"small plates\".  We tried the pulled pork sliders.  So good.",

We also had the octopus salad, and we liked that a lot.  We had the pork and the branzino for main course , and both were good, but neither was anything special.  Finally, for dessert we had the peaches semifredo, which was also ok but nothing special.  we were celebrating our pre-anniversary and they brought some dessert with candle to congratulate us. Overall, very pleasant experience.  Nothing negative to say but wasn't blown away.  Price came out to $200 (my bf and I each got a drink).",

We all thought it was one of the best meals ever.  Atmosphere was also very nice.  As for the service, I almost downgraded to 4 stars, just based on service.  When we arrived, after sitting for 10 minutes, we saw no one.  I had to go to hostess stand.  They apologized, and after that the service was excellent.  The waiter who took our food order was not the greatest, as we had some menu questions, and his English was not that great, and really could not understand the questions, and provide adequate answers.  These were fairly minor glitches, in an otherwise perfect evening.",

I had read that Aureole had a great happy hour, so we headed over to the bar to partake. Two for one wine flights and appetizers. We got, how do I put this delicately...wasted. The wine was plentiful and the appetizers, while delicious (I had my first oxtail) were not enough to stave off the effects of the alcohol.  Our bartender was really nice and attentive. I disliked one of the wines in my flight and he chose another one for me to replace it. He let us play with the digital wine list, and kept a close eye on our needs all evening. After our flights he suggested some desert wines that were a great way to end our Aureole experience and then release us into the casino, inhibitions shorn away!  Overall, a very pleasant experience and I am sad to see the bad reviews Aureole has been receiving lately. I have always wanted to have dinner there but I will wait until things improve.",

    "text": "In such a restaurant-intense town, I would think any restaurant that has been around for awhile, like this, would work to develop the repeat customer.  Offer a unique, intimate experience that makes a diner feel, \"I gotta do that again.\"  I didn't see any reason to return here, nor did anyone else in my group of 9.  The space is beautiful.  I appreciate a little design and under-decoration in Vegas.  The wine cage is a nice gimmick--hey, it's Vegas.  Then, downhill.  We had a dinner reservation, but the hosts seem to have some debate as to where we were to be seated.  This was surprising because when we arrived, the place was half-empty.  Our waiter could barely be understood; I didn't catch his name.  Nor could he describe the dishes well or offer meaningful dining suggestions.  He was essentially a scribe,and not very good at that. The drink tablet (one per table in a group this big?) was silly and cumbersome and tedious for all of us to pass around.  The drinks... unremarkable, but not bad.   Our dinner order was a bit mixed up (i.e, part of it wrong) upon arrival.  Our food good but underwhelming (we just ordered a la carte)--maybe the tasting menu could be more special? And to end our night--silliness  with the bill, minor and ultimately addressed.   We had a great time and nothing catastrophic happened, but as I reread this review, it's summarizes an experience I would expect from TGI Friday's, not reportedly fine dining.",

So, when we asked them if they could make something Vegetarian, their first response was \"we can make mac and cheese for you.\" Are you kidding me?! Can you believe that?! Then they said how about steamed vegetables?! WTF? This is 2016 and almost every restaurant will have one decent Veg option. Not this place. Finally after back and forth, they made a Veg risotto which was average at best. Then, we ended up finding a long piece of hair in the bread. When we told them, they said 'oh sorry about that, here is another piece of bread'. Really? We spent over $800 for 8 people and got lousy food and average service. Never coming back here again.",

Also it was cool out the servers busted out the wine list on a computer pad.   That just proves how serious they were!

    "text": "Although the decor, layout, and service was impressive along with their extensive wine list (I hear there are around 50,000) and their UBER-COOL touch-screen wine tablet ordering process & the way the wines are retrieved from a giant four-story, temperature controlled glass and steel wine tower (apparently the largest in the world - and even cooler, \"wine angels\" in black attach themselves to a harness of sorts to retrieve your bottle of choice), we had to limit ourselves to the prix-fixe menu as we had tickets to Lion King for that same evening.   I'm not sure if maybe that was our mistake, but I've been to plenty of other places where the pre-theater menu's been outstanding. Was a little disappointed w/this particular Charlie Palmer location. Maybe Dry Creek won't disappoint the next time I go to Wine Country..  Also, there was a rather pushy photographer moving from table to table offering to take pictures of people, and then interrupting your dinner with a sales pitch. I'm surprised the staff at Aureole allow that..  We ordered: * GRILLED CHICKEN SKEWER \"PUTTANESCA\" FENNEL SCENTED ORZO          - [2.5/5 - A little chewy and under seasoned.] * GRILLED PACIFIC MAHI MAHI CORN AND FINGERLING POTATO HASH, TEQUILA LIME JUS          - [1/5 - Unpalatable, my friend struggled to eat it and didn't end up having more than 1/5th with my help.] * ROASTED BELL PEPPER AND SMOKED MOZZARELLA RAVIOLIS CREAMY SPINACH          - [3/5 - Average decent ravioli - I've tasted better in casual bistros.] * DARK CHOCOLATE PECAN TART BOURBON SAUCE          - [2/5 - Alright.] * CARAMELIZED BANANA BREAD PUDDING, BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE          - [4/5 - The starring dish of the night. In retrospect, I don't think it was STELLAR, but it was definitely the most delicious thing we consumed that night.]",

My standards for a 5 star dining place are really high - I expect the best when I'm shelling out big bucks!   We were drawn to Aureole by a $50 GC from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> and an $85 valentines day weekend 5 course menu. The menu *sounded* good and we'd never tried Aureole so figured it was a great time to give it a go.   I think I read the word \"Corporate\" in someone else's review in describing the atmosphere. It was pretty, but it felt like a nice hotel in Sweden or something to me. It was cold, austere, modern, but not in a \"cool\" sense. Just kinda blah.  The wine angel and wine tablet were freaking cool. I was however disappointed by their insane prices (only 3 red wines in the entire book under $50 that I could find!) and every wine I wanted to drink (favorites from Napa/Italy) weren't in there. So much for their huge wine list. We did try a $60 or so bottle from Italy and were happy, however.  Anyways, if you're still with me.. here's the food!  *Caviar/Smoked Salmon: So incredibly blah and boring. I love smoked salmon but this fell flat. I had a better smoked salmon appetizer at a wedding I was at recently - sad.  *Short Rib Ravioli with Foie Gras - This was divine and saved the meal from being one of the most boring meals I've had in a long time.  *Dover Sole - bland and tasteless. I took 2 bites and quit eating it.   *Beef Wellington - I do love me some Beef Wellington but this was one of the worst I've had. Not particularly flavorful and didn't compare to Chef's Palette in Henderson.   *Dessert - lots of sorbet, some raspberry parfait thing, some icky coffee flavored \"tart\". Nothing to write home about.   Overall I was pretty disappointed by this pricey dinner. None of the food was awful, but it was so freaking boring and bland I felt like I was eating cruise line food or catered food. There weren't those special touches you get at Alex (amuse bouche platter, special desserts,etc) and for $40 more per person I wish I had spent my money there instead!   For the record I also was pretty disappointed by Charlie Palmer Steak in the Four Seasons. Maybe his NYC outposts are good, but his Vegas restaurants could really use some work!",

    "text": "I've been told before that I'm \"emotionally sterile\". What does that even mean? Maybe, I'm not overly emotional, unreasonably dramatic, or fail to exhibit the cliched passion that comes with the warm fuzzies. Possibly, it's because I'm not googley eyed and in love and have yet to demonstrate the depths of True love. That may have all changed after my exceptional experience at Aureole. I'm in love with Aureole.   I can now rant and rave and become emotionally obsessed with the rich and decadent life that I could lead with Aureole.   Ever had a meal so good you think that you're going to faint from the deliciousness? Ever tasted something so good you literally had that elusive foodgasm? Not an easy feat, but damn you Aureole, I'm seriously sprung off of what you have serving up!  First, let me just set the scene here. Mom, Susan 1 and I met at Mandalay for dinner. I had just come off my high of beating the house and I was ready to celebrate. We went to Strip Steak first and seeing that they had an hour wait, I remembered that incredible wine tower and boom! Dinner at Aureole was coming to fruition. We walked down the steps that curve along the wine tower-a pretty cool sight-down to the check-in stand. I wasn't in any condition for fancy dining-but it's Vegas-if you got the money, they got the goods. We were seated at a lovely table by the window. The sommelier came by and we ended up with a great bottle of Pinot Noir. Let's jump into our tasty meal.  Cavier-Russian Golden Ostera served with toast, finely chopped onions, egg white and yolk and cream. Delicious-salty, briney and heaven with every bite! Let me just say that when I ordered the cavier, our server told us that they were out. Seeing the slight disappointment in my face, he excused himself only to come back a few minutes later and said he was SENDING someone to get my cavier from another restaurant on the property. WHAT?!?   Roasted Butternut Squash with Succotash-Smooth, nutty and just spectacular! The succotash with arugula was so good!  Roasted Chicken-served with black truffle jus-need I say more? The skin was crispy without sacrificing the moistness and flavor!  Roasted Pork Chop with roasted tomatoes-Large portion, filling and well flavored!  Duo beef filet with skirt steak-I like my steak medium rare-it came out the peerrrfect temprature and practically melted, and I mean melted in my mouth!  Creamy Spinach Au Gratin-Susan's favorite! A great side-definitely very rich!  Parmesan Fries-and dare I say I tasted some truffle oil in there?   Dessert Sampler-Strusel Baked Apple-Yummy. Who doesn't love baked apple? It's the ultimate comfort food. Salted Caramel Bombe-Wow! Salt and sweet definitely go together here! Warm Molten Cake-I'm no chocolate lover, but I was giddy about this! Macaroon Tea Creme Brulee-a very different taste but surprisingly good!  Tasting of Pumpkin-Spiced pumpkin cake, chocolate ginger pot de creme, honey caramel lollipop. All amazing!  As if that wasn't enough-our lovely waiter, Jose brought us a large sampler of their sorbets to wrap up the night. The food was heavenly but it doesn't stop there. I don't hand out 5 star reviews just for anyone....  The great food is just like great sex. Really satisfying and fun but probably won't keep me coming back unless there is some depth....And, like I said, I'm in love with Aureole...now let me tell you why....  Our waiter, Jose was outstanding! Knowledgeable, warm and inviting! He not only brought us the sorbets but after drinking our bottle of wine-he brought me another glass of Pinot on the house! I told him how amazing our night was and thanked him for the experience. He then offered to give me, Susan and my mom a tour of the kitchen and to meet the chef!  What? I didn't even know that things like this happened! My mom is currently in culinary school and the very thought of seeing the inside workings of one of Charlie Palmer's gems was something we could not pass up! Charlie Palmer of course wasn't there but we did get to meet Chef Vincent who was not only very accommodating but welcomed us in his kitchen! He even posed for a few pictures with us. He allowed us to take pictures of his kitchen and we sat and chatted for a bit. He even signed the menu and wrote  a small note for my mom. My mom's excitement was priceless-she is extremely passionate about her culinary studies and the look on her face was worth every single penny I spent at Aureole.   To sum it up:  Food-5 stars Wine selection and the\"angels\" that grab the bottles-5 stars Service-10 stars (it's my review, I can give 10 stars) Ambiance and experience-100 stars  Thank you to Aureole! I love you! Thanks to Jose and Chef Vincent as well!",

The rabbit and the desserts were the main standouts for me. My friend had the wine pairing along with it, but he said the pairings were not all that great.  The other highlights food-wise were the onion soup served in puff pastry, and the dessert sampler.   Okay. Now for the rest. I hope you're not going anywhere.  The service here was ATROCIOUS. Call me crazy, but if I'm dining at a one Michelin star restaurant with a group of people whose tab is over $1100 bucks, am I wrong to expect service that's better than my local Chili's? I guess so.  We were seated by one waiter/captain and ordered drinks. My friend's wife ordered a glass of wine, and another person ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour). We then proceeded to order dinner. About half the table wanted the tasting menu, while the other half wanted to go ala carte. The waiter said that would be just fine. We also indicated that we were going to be paying separately...also told that would be fine.  Food service began. Those that ordered the tasting menu got their food first. The head waiter/captain (different guy now) failed to describe all of the courses after they were served. He totally flubbed the dessert course...basically seemed like he had no idea what they were serving. The half of the table that ordered the tasting menu got almost all of their food before the other half got theirs, so half of our party just sat there twiddling their thumbs while the others ate.  Finally the other food came out. Several people ordered steaks. None of them were asked if their steak was cooked to their preference. My friend's wife that ordered one glass of wine? She was brought two, for some reason. She also ordered a side dish that was never served.   Throughout the meal, no water glasses were refilled. I had to ask each time for more water. Empty cocktail glasses sat unbussed. Breadcrumbs were never swept away. Empty sweetener packets were left on the table.   After everyone had eaten, they brought out dessert menus. We looked but opted not to order anything. For some reason, two desserts were brought to our table. We thought that since no one ordered anything, these must have been given to us gratis. Nope! They showed up on our bill.  Speaking of the bill. Like I said earlier, we had indicated that we were going to be paying separately. The waiter told us that he couldn't split it for us, but if we wanted to personally divide up the check he could put it on multiple cards. We gave in and did it. As we're tallying up the tab for everyone, head waiter dude comes back and basically chastises us, saying \"you know, if you would have told me at the beginning of the meal that you wanted the check separated, I could have done it then. But now it's too late.\" Really dude? Fuck you.  The last straw was when we finally had our bill sorted, everyone paid and signed. As we're leaving, dipshit waiter guy runs up to us claiming that one of us (me) hasn't paid. Bullshit. I said my bill is on the table. He says no, I never saw it. So I walk back to the table, and it's under a fucking napkin. Good job Einstein. Never thought to look there?  The service at this restaurant is honestly one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. I almost feel like because we were a party of nine, and gratuity was automatically included, that they just said \"fuck you we're getting tipped no matter what.\" If I'm dropping that much coin I expect things to run much more smoothly. It's a shame, because the food here isn't bad. But then again I've had much better for much cheaper. I can't imagine any reason I would ever come back here, especially with the multitude of other fine dining options available in Las Vegas.  And if I ever see that worthless waiter again I'm gonna punch him in the balls.",

The service was awful....the bartender was tending to some drunk folks with an apparant familial connection to the place. The burger sliders were raw AND cold. The cheese plate was unimaginative and stingy. Was this cheese from Kraft? The wine selection was over the top pricey. A manager-like well dressed man was trying hard to tie up loose ends, but to no avail.   Slightly less than mediocre experience from start to finish. When we informed the employees gathering at the hostess stand, they seemed less than interested. We could have been at an Outback for this type of attention. But wait, we would have recieved more concern and better service at Outback.  Will not go again...too many other choices abound in Las Vegas.",

I am by no means an expert in food or wine, but anyone can appreciate the quality of Aureole. The iPad full of bottles of wine was overwhelming but the Wine Connoisseur was, of course, extremely knowledgeable and able to suggest the perfect pairings for your meal.   We sat in the swan court, I would highly recommend getting a table in this area. Not only do you have a view of the fountain with swans swimming in it (I was skeptical that they were real, but they were!), but you have access to a private patio. While waiting for your meal you can enjoy your drinks comfortably outside or even lounge for a few cocktails after you meal. That is the absolutely perfect dining experience in my opinion.   As mentioned, I am not a food critic by any means so I'm not even going to try to tackle describing what we ate - it's that good. Please, just take my word for it, you will have an amazing experience and an amazing meal here. Aureole does not disappoint.  On a side note, my father-in-law must eat gluten free. They were extremely accommodating with this bringing him his own bread, wine, and ensuring every dish was made to meet his dietary needs.",

They sat four very large parties ahead of us while we waited. After 15 minutes I went to the hostess stand and asked when we were going to be seated - they seemed to have let the reservation.  Once we got to our table we waited a very long time for our server to come greet us. This became that pattern of the night. We sat with dirty, empty plates for a very long time and once those were cleared we waited for an even longer time for someone to come ask us if we wanted dessert.  For a place that charges such an incredible premium for it's food and even more for it's wine one expects MUCH better service.  The food was ok - nothing spectacular.  There are far better places for far less where one doesn't have to wait for service.",

    "text": "A nice dinner out with the Husband can never be beat.  On this particular occasion, we chose Aureole at Mandalay.  As they showed us to our table, I reminded them that I had requested side by side seating in our reservation.  At that point, she asked if we wouldn't mind a booth and showed us to a lovely booth in the Swan's Court overlooking the swan pond.  This was actually nicer than sitting in the main dining room.  We knew we wanted to do one of their prix fixe menus, and they had two on this particular evening.  We decided on the Parallel Tasting Menu ($85 per person).  We didn't realize that this meant we would both get everything on the menu, which we actually found to our benefit.  First Course: * Dungeness Crab and Ahi Tuna Mille Feuille, Coconut Kefir Lime Froth - Just as the waiter was about to present this to us, he realized that perhaps I could not eat the ahi tuna since I was preggos.  He immediately whisked it back to the kitchen and said he would take care of it.  We thought that was really sweet that he even remembered!  When it did arrive, only the Husband got it on his plate and I did not.  Nicely presented with a pretty foam, he wasn't as impressed with it as the crab cakes.  * Seared Dungeness Crab Cake, Papaya Salsa, Yuzu Aioli - The Husband received only one of these while I received three (since I didn't get the crab and tuna mille feuille).  I thought it was so good, especially with the aioli.  The salsa added a nice sweetness and it was just licking it all up!  Second Course: *Olive Oil Poached Wild King Salmon, Citrus Braised Fennel, Sambal Buerre Blanc - I'm not the biggest fan of cooked fish, but the poached salmon was okay although not extraordinary. * House made Salmon Angelotti, Wilted Pea Tendrils, Olive Tomato Emulsion - The agnolotti pasta was a bit tough and doughy, and looked more like bone marrow covered in red sauce when it was presented.  Third Course: * Japanese Pepper, Wagyu Beef Strip Loin, Grilled Abalone Mushroom, Sweet Potatoes Fries - My biggest fault in ordering this dish was having it medium well, which isn't exactly how I would usually have my beef (rare, please).  I think this played a factor as to why my meat was tough and not as enjoyable as it could have been. * Seared Diver Sea Scallop, Yukon Gold Morel Mushroom and Fava Beans, Potato Gnocchi - Who doesn't like a perfectly cooked diver sea scallop?  Yum yum yum.  And with mushrooms?  Even better!   Fourth Course:  * Blueberry Meyer Lemon Financier  * Lemon Mascarpone Semifreddo * Blueberry Lemon Verbena Sorbet All the desserts, including the complimentary trio of sorbets, were just wonderful.  (I think the flavors were coconut, tangerine, and watermelon.)  We enjoyed every bit of our trio of desserts and could have kept on going.  They definitely do their sorbets very well here too.  Service was fabulous.  The waiter was attentive without being overbearing and our beverage glasses were refilled in almost a timely manner.  The one thing that isn't so great is the house photographer.  They offer to take your picture at the beginning of the meal and have you pose in certain ways too, and then show you various packages you can buy at the end.  It's pretty expensive for a few pictures and ultimately, you just don't want it.  It can put a damper on your evening when you just want to dine, and not worry about buying silly pictures.  Overall, Aureole was a good experience.  It wasn't super fabulous and we weren't there to watch the Wine Fairies, but it was a good meal overall.  Of course, it helped that we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon too.",

It was actually my wife who suggested we get the tasting menu and since it was her birthday I was all too happy to oblige. ;-)  Not really a whole lot more to write than what the other reviews wrote - but the food was very very good and service was outstanding as well.  I did think the iPad wine list was a bit gimmicky.... especially since at one time our waiter had to get three different iPads since the first two didn't seem to work (and once when I was looking through the app crashed and I had to restart it). A regular wine list may just be easier...  Anyway I was thoroughly impressed with both food and service and would not hesitate to go back again soon!",

    "text": "I'll start with the background.  I'm in technology sales and attend 2-3 week-long conferences in Las Vegas each year.  I also sell to and meet with tech companies in Las Vegas.  So, I've had over 50 business trips to Vegas in my career and on each visit try a mixture of new places, old standbys and places recommended by friends that live in Vegas.  I'm a foodie and cook that lives in Marin County, so know a little about food, wine and cooking.  And on my business travels I've been fortunate to dine at some of the best establishments in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, New York, L.A., Chicago, Dallas - all around the country and internationally.  Over the past five years our sales team has dined at every restaurant in the Mandalay Bay where Interop is held and have enjoyed each.  We finally decided to splurge and try Aureole.  Overall I'll say that, for the price and the hype, Aureole was mediocre.  Everyone on our team agreed.  From reading other reviews it seems the pre fixe and tasting menus are the safe bets.  We all chose to order a la carte.   Two of us had the New York steak and the cut was overcooked and fatty.  Our VP's octopus was overcooked and chewy.  One person had scallops that were under-seasoned and flavorless.  The creme-brulee was bland.  It's OK to pay these prices for excellent food.  It's disappointing to pay these prices for lackluster preparation.  The wine list is quite expensive even by Las Vegas standards.  The minimum buy-in for bottles of mid-level Cabernet was $110, with only one or two choices at this price-point.    For comparison, the next night we had a far superior bottles of Cab at Fix in the Bellagio for $80.    If you're willing to pay a huge premium to show that you can then this is your restaurant.   If you're ordering the tasting or pre fixe menus, perhaps you'll have a better experience than the a la carte choices.  I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and perhaps they had an \"off\" night.  However, when a major tech trade show is held on your property I would assume an establishment such as this would be on their A Game.  For our large party we experienced a very expensive C.",

The a la carte menu looked reasonable, but we both opted for the $65 Prix Fixe Menu:  FIRST: \"Argugula Salad\" or \"Chilled Spring Pea Soup\"...soup was very good and came with a ham n cheese melt to supplement, but the wife's salad was better and quite large.     SECOND: \"Cajun Hanger Steak\"...best steak I've ever had! Juicy, tender, just the right amount of spice, and mouthwatering. If you normally order medium-rare, I would go with medium as it was still pretty bloody...\"Roasted Halibut\" was also fantastic and cooked perfectly, but we both agreed the steak was better.    THIRD: \"Chocolate Spearmint Bar\" or \"Bananas Foster Parfait\"...you can't go wrong with either.  They also give you complimentary \"Petite Fours\", nice touch.  They also gave us 4th dessert, for free, which was a tasting of 6 mini scoops of sorbet.  Foooood Cooooommmaaaa...  Don't judge by the outside, the inside is quite huge, elegant, and beautiful.  Service was excellent; it felt like we had 2-3 waiters.  Wine Tower was spiffy, but the cheapest glass of red was $13, white $11...*Sad Frowney Face*.

The only complaint I have is our wait staff took us straight to the \"downstairs\" seats, which requires to order from their set menu (it's $20 more than the upstairs seats). When I found out about it, I requested to be seated at the \"upstairs\" table (which allows me to order from regular menu or set menu for $20 less). Our stupid server wouldn't want us to leave his table, and I believe it's most likely because he didn't want to lose his chance for making tips. Yikes. I had to ask 3 times, and finally kinda yelled at him to make him give up on us and take us to the regular seating area. It's unfortunate for a Michelin starred restaurant.",

They were very accommodating and everything was ready and waiting upon arrival.  Just to see the three story wine \"cellar\". Is amazing.  It has an amazing elevator system!  The price is about $100 per person but remember good food costs money.  You pay for what you get.  The restaurant has the biggest wine selection I've ever seen.  The bottles of wine cost anywhere from $90-$900.  Food and wine is an experience, not a meal.  This place provides that experience.",

The Duck and the Chicken were both tasteless although Presentation was good. The Potato Gratin was completely devoid of taste and didn't seem to have any seasoning whatsoever. I could cook a better meal at home. At this price point, the experience needs to be amazing and this was frankly a huge disappointment. Time to fire the chef!",

    "text": "Did the 6-course tasting menu ($110) plus wine pairings ($55). 3* might actually be generous, but I think it's fair because Aureole was basically half good, half not-so-good.  For example, some of the courses were excellent. The duck confit cavatelli was to die for, the foie gras and churros were perfectly cooked, and the king salmon and caviar (technically first course, but more like a big amuse) was a joy to eat. But many of the dishes were ridiculously salty. The lamb course was essentially ruined by this - I couldn't eat more than two bites, that's how salty it was. Even the duck confit cavatelli, which I loved, was tough to finish because it was so salty.  Service-wise, all staff we encountered - waiter, bussers, food runners, bartenders - were very friendly and welcoming. On the other hand, the meal was not paced well, there was a general lack of attention to detail, and we were repeatedly left waiting for utensils and wine to match up with our courses.  Ultimately, in a vacuum, I don't think most people would be outright disappointed by the overall experience here. But given the plethora of other options on the Strip in the $110 price range (or less, for that matter), I doubt I'd find myself at Aureole.  Side note: I think prior iterations of this restaurant were fancier, but this is now a completely casual restaurant - plenty of people in shorts, t-shirts, and sneakers, so feel free to dress comfy.",

    "text": "Wow....I've never been more sad.  I come here nearly every year because they have the most fantastic Reverse Happy hour ever.  Normally this menu is filled with about 12 options for $7 each and roughly 4 cocktails for the same price.  We come in with a group of 4-5 and usually get about 10 things to eat and 8 cocktails and leave very happy!  You can read my previous review to see how this place won my heart previously.  This time around we come in and the first thing I notice is the menu is tiny...6 options and 1 \"whatever the bartender feels like making\" bar option.  On top of that, everything is now $9 instead of $7.  On top of THAT, the options SUCK.  I was so glad to see that the amazing French Onion soup was still on the menu so we ordered just that.  At $9 for soup, it wasn't even a great deal...I'd have a hard time paying $9 for a small cup of soup anywhere...but I really wanted to love this place still.  The soup was still great...but unfortunately not a good deal as it used to be.  I'm so sad that this place pretty much butchered the amazing happy hour menu...this was a staple of mine for a very long time. Au Revoir Aureole.",

    "text": "I chose Aureole for my reception dinner after my wedding. The food was delicious, but I cannot emphasize enough how much I would not recommend using Aureole for any sort of event. I worked with a group dining person from Mandalay for all of the planning for my event and then was told the day before that she was not going to actually be at the event, that I would have someone from the restaurant who would be the point of contact the day of. I think this disconnect between planning the event with one person and dealing with another person day of is what caused the majority of the issues I encountered.   The biggest thing was the free pouring of wine when we were paying by the bottle for it. In discussing with the planner, I emphasized multiple times that we were on a budget and were going to be cheap with the alcohol as much as possible. I assumed they would serve restaurant style, giving people glasses of what they ordered and asking if they want another when it was gone. Instead, they were walking around topping off glasses, pouring them for people that didn't want them (there was a random glass poured for me before I even got there and I don't even drink wine,) and even trying to pour for my underage nieces (who I told the planner about in advance) who told me they had to turn down wine several times before they stopped trying to pour for them.  They also went around at the end offering up a coffee service which many of my guests took because they thought it was an included service, when it was actually $5+ per cup.   I signed a contract that stated that if we stayed past the end time, it was $500 per half hour extra for the room, but 30 minutes until our end time, the dinner was just being served. When I complained to them about this they insisted that they never would have charged me that without discussing it with me first, but how was I to know that? I had signed a contract that said they could charge me so when I noticed the time I immediately went into rush mode trying to do the cake cutting and finish up as soon as possible.   There were a lot of little details that just made the whole experience stressful as well. Two of the menus were misprinted with the wrong entrees to choose from. This would not have been as big of a deal, except that it caused 10 other people to come up and ask me if they had the correct menu because no one was sure which was correct now. I was told by the planner that we would go over the final bill the following Monday, but after I had left to do pictures, the restaurant presented the bill to my father (who was not paying and had nothing to do with the bill) who then called and interrupted pictures trying to figure if it was correct or not. They also had my wedding cake out on the cake table, but no plate, fork, or even something to cut it with. When I sent them an email about this after the fact, they told me that most brides bring their own cake cutting set. That is completely fine, but it should have been something the planner gave me a heads up on to bring my own rather than having to scramble to find something makeshift and ask for each item individually (can we have a knife, can we have a plate, can we get a fork, etc.)   Basically, I am just really disappointed because I spent a lot of time discussing details with the planner, but because she was not there the night of, it didn't matter. I was the one who had to problem solve and get interrupted because no one else knew what was going on. I also was extremely unhappy with the response I received from the restaurant after bringing some of this to their attention. It was very condescending and completely unapologetic. Las Vegas used to be known as a customer service town where you weren't nickel and dimed, I don't know if they just have outsiders running it now or what, but this was not what I expected.",

They lacked some sensory acuity when butting  into table conversations and trying to rush orders when the restaurant was near empty.  I ordered the small portion of calamari for an appetizer and found the tentacles cut too thin and over cooked.    The rack of lamb dish was small with under-cooked lamb chops (asked for medium/well done and got medium) with not enough sauce.  The basket of bread was soft but unmemorable.  We received complimentary sorbet balls (coconut, mixed berry and strawberry) after we received the coffee and none of them tasted good.  No-one ate a complete ball of sorbet.  For a high end restaurant I expected a nice assortment of sugar for hot drinks but instead the sugar bowl was filled with toxic, artificial sweeteners.  There was no turbinado sugar or stevia combination options.  In fact, there were only 2 sachets of white sugar for the entire table.  Overall, we found the food to be underwhelming and grossly overpriced and we will not be returning.",

The bread with the salted butter and herbs was addictive... my tomato salad with goat cheese mousse was pretty,  unique and good. The Caesar was not though with too much garlic and not enough anchovies.  Dinner was a complete let down though. The steaks were under seasoned and overcooked.  For $59, I have higher expectations.  Since everyone's steaks were underwhelming,  there didn't seem to be a point in sending anything back. The mac and cheese was bland. The scallops were sad, squished down and also under seasoned. We were all so disappointed with the actual dinner we didn't want to try desserts. Overall, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the money or worthy of their reputation. I liked the tomatoes though....",

    "text": "I dined at Aureole on October 17 with my parents who were in town to celebrate my birthday with me in Las Vegas. I made a reservation and let the Aureole team know my father is a fan of wine, and they pulled out all stops.   We were seated by the management team with a view of the stunning four-story wine tower. Paige and Chelsea were lovely and took time to chat with our party along with other guests. Knowing we chose this spot for the fabulous wine program, they had the wine angel ascend up the wine tower for our party, even though we hadn't ordered a bottle of wine.   Our server Oscar did a fabulous job explaining the menu to us and answering our questions about the 3,000-bottle selection of wine as well as the by-the-glass pairing options (there are two pairings for each item on the menu). We opted for the by-the-glass option, since we all prefer different types of wine and champagne.    Our meal started with caviar and oysters, both of which were fresh. Chef Alex came out and introduced himself. He made sure we knew his favorites and about the menu inspiration. The highlights we tried included the French onion soup, which was incredible, the short rib ravioli, and the beet salad. I had the filet minion, which was cooked to perfection. My parents both opted for fish dishes, which were all fresh. The team also found out it was my birthday and sent out a hazelnut creme brulee - it was to die for!  My parents were so impressed not only by the food they ate, but by the incredible hospitality provided by the Aureole team. My mom said it was one of the best meals she has had in years and we all felt like VIPs. I would highly recommend Aureole for a special occasion. Make sure they know in your reservation if you are celebrating something or someone - they will pull out all the stops.",

The bench seats at the tables reminded me of dining at a run off the mill restaurant not to the level that Aureole was. Service was ok not great. The staff wasn't very attentive for an example it took over 15 minutes for the wine sommelier to return to my Table to place the wine order. The wine list was very extensive with a high mark up to match. I felt the \"wine angel\" gimmick was really lame. Basically when you ordered a bottle of wine a beautiful lady adorned in a silver jumpsuit goes into the multistory wine room and does a few flips on the guide wire and comes down with your bottle of wine.  The food was mixed from outstanding to mediocre. I ordered the Cesar salad and it was not that great it was drowning in dressing that tasted it came from a bottle. The bread was served at room temperature and resembled sliced sandwich bread.  My wife had the beet  salad and she said it was excellent and was well prepared. For the main course I had the filet and it was very tender and cooked perfectly  the minus on the filet is that it lacked the rich flavor that one gets when ordering that cut of meat but it was still enjoyable. The dessert was awesome a huge surprise. I had the cream brulee with a brown sugar whisky like  sauce with a cranberry sorbet and pomegranate on it. This sourness of the cranberry and pomegranate blended so perfectly with the super sweet cream brulee.  Would I come back again?  Maybebecause at this price point I expect perfection from from the service to the entire meal and I feel there were too many misses in my experience.",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Charlie Palmer since he debuted in 99 with the original Aureole , with the opening of Mandalay Bay. I was so impressed by how elegant and stunning the room was and the massive wine tower . I remember my first time because it truly made an impression on me of how fine dining should be! I even have dined at the original one in NYC after trying the Vegas location, but somehow the second establishment was more stellar.   Aureole has undergone a renovation as have most of the establishments in Mandalay Bay , a more relaxed, semi-casual , and more approachable menu items . Johnny Church is back , but as the Executive Chef and his menu is brilliant . I decided just to pop in to the lounge and give it a try after a day of shopping at Mandalay Place. The room still holds its WOW! esthetics , the wine tower and beautiful entrance with the staircase going down gradually revealing the expansive , lovely warm toned colors of the room. It is beautiful and inviting to the senses . I sat down and the bartender J offered me a cocktail list , but since I don't drink he created a nice mocktail for me to enjoy. He was very engaging and knew what kind of drink I would like, something that looks fun, but with out the alcohol . I was getting hungry so he handed me a menu and I saw so many things I wanted to try. There was quite a large selection , I was leaning towards the octopus and beef carpaccio , but then the steaks looked amazing! I had only a limited time so I decided to try their smaller menu, the wine angel Ebony came over and I asked her what they recommended and they both said the grilled cheese with nuts and jam were really good and would come out quick . I finished with the chocolate and berry tart , with berry sorbet !!!!! To top it off the wine angel was very kind and took pictures with me and even went up to do a demo looking like a James Bond or Femme Fatale movie star in her harness , retrieving bottles from the wine tower.   It was a fun evening and I could see outside which I like about this place as well, a lovely thunderstorm was happening and lightening was flashing behind the palm trees of the Mandalay pool area.   I did get to see chef Johnny and he was very kind and invited me to come back for dinner in the dining room, I promised I would and I can't wait to try the octopus and beef carpaccio , and the steak! I'm a huge fan on CP Steak as well and Charlie Palmer is probably my favorite out of all the Vegas chefs. I mean he kind of speaks for himself , being here since 99. After all these years I still love his restaurants and it's actually one of the places that make you want to get dressed up and come out. The staff is always friendly and attentive, never intrusive . It took a while for me check out the remodel and I wish I came in earlier . I'm planning to come back for dinner soonin the main room or swan court.",

    "text": "Came in here on a Friday night with a reservation at 8:00 PM. We checked in and were escorted to the elevator to go down. However, once we got off, there was no hostess there. We waited for about 10 minutes with another party for someone to show up and greet us.  We got sat down at the swan court I requested for more a more private feel. We waited another 5 to 10 minutes for our server to come over and greet us. We weren't ready to order our drinks yet so we asked for a couple minutes, he didn't come back for another 15 minutes. The restaurant was probably at a 30% capacity. The busser, however, noticed that we were looking around and provided us with waters without us having to ask.  The cocktails we ordered weren't that great, at a fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, you can get much better quality drinks for the same price point. The bread service is also very weak, with a cheap looking slice of french or ciabatta bread. Again, Las Vegas has many other restaurants where you pay over $100 that provide better bread service, and service overall.  We decided to go with the summer tasting menu, in order to get a little bit of everything. However, for $115, the portions are TOO little. How is the main entree going to be a mere 3 slices of duck breast, or one lamb lollipop? The scallop dish had ONE scallop. The two dishes we enjoyed was the foie gras and the panna cotta. It's way overpriced for what you get, and we left unsatisfied. I'd rather spend an extra $15 per person to dine at Michael Mina in the Bellagio again.  I feel that this restaurant is outdated, as with many of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay when you compare it to the newer places in the center strip. As an MLife gold member, I don't think I'll ever return to this restaurant. Seems like a waste of $330 for two people.",

    "text": "As you descend the two flights from Mandalay Bay's main concourse to Aureole you are stuck by the tower of wine in the center of the staircase, a promise this Michelin rated place will be worth  the price.  Reception is more efficient than welcoming and you are soon escorted to your table.  For such an apparently sophisticated locale dress is remarkably casual.  My coat and tie were in the minority, as was my touch of gray hair.  We have been there twice and both times the clientele was predominantly 20 and 30-somethings and in shirt sleeves and fashionable jeans.  Ask for a table in the back near the waterfall and swan pond.  The wine list is indeed impressive, but is presented on what must be the original pad computer.  It requires a stylus, is balky and is as non-intuitive as can be.  Come with an idea of what wine you want and insist the sommelier operate the damn thing for you before she slips away.   Service overall was excellent though it was Valentine's Day evening and the place was packed.  We both ordered fish, perhaps not the specialties of the house.  The swordfish in citrus with vegetables was beautifully presented.  The root vegetables were partially peeled with the skins tied into butterfly wings.  The fish was only good by comparison.  The red snapper, characterized by our waiter as flaky, was under cooked and flavorless.  It was presented on a bacon infused bed of vegetables that were much better than the fish.  The side of root vegetables was uniquely spiced and delicious.  The star of the meal was the onion soup, presented under a pastry shell the waiter cut open.  Excellent.  For such a highly rated restaurant the evening was disappointing.",

    "text": "This place is wonderful. It's located inside the Mandalay Bay. You will see an enormous wine tower. It's a vertical wine cellar! You can't miss it. Walk towards it down the stairs and your in.    I don't like bars because of the experiences I had growing up in Central Florida. So it takes allot to get me to really like a bar. That being said I loved this place. This place is high class. One of the bottles on the wine menu is $14,000.00. There were a bunch of people here dressed to kill. Hidden. Laid back. Guys in suits at the bar discussing million dollar deals etc. I loved it here.  It's probably best not to come here if you're on a tight budget. This place costs more for a reason. They have this amazing one of a kind wine tower and floor area. The bar tenders are highly skilled and could make all the drinks I asked for in seconds with no questions asked. This really stood out to me. It was yes sir and here is your drink.   That's what I like. Super fast excellent service. No waiting. Usually when I order a favorite mixed drink at a typical bar (example: Lights of Havana etc) the bartender looks at me like I'm an idiot. Why? Because he/she is displaying a defensive reaction because he/she doesn't know how to make the drink I've requested. Not here.    I'm just going to say it:  There is a certain element of people who patron typical bars whom I really prefer not to be around. Thankfully you will not find this element of people here. If you are into socializing with the trash found at local dive bars this place is not for you.You are just going to feel out of place. There are no cheap pool tables. No. sawdust on the floor. No desperate middle aged spinsters with cheap perfume sitting in the corner. No delusional local bands singing for their next \"big break\". This is not a dive bar or even a \"good\" bar like \"Public House\" or \"Toby Keith's I love this bar\".   This place is a cut above the rest.  Will come back here again in July for the business expo and UFC fight. :) Can't wait!",

Maybe it was the b-day celebration or perhaps it was the 'girl-on-girl' action, but we definitely felt special that night.  For dinner, we had the prefixed 3 course entree.  They were very good, but definitely not the best in Vegas.  During dinner, (I swear) EVERY ONE that was working came by to wish me happy birthday, they even had a professional singer  came out and sang.  Their staffs were chatty and funny, definitely made us felt comfortable.  At the end, they brought out extra glasses of wine and desserts (you might laugh, but their sorbet was THE BEST), offered us to meet the chef and tour the kitchen- we were too stuffed for that type of activity.   Just when we thought the night is over,  our waiter offered to take us out back by swan lake for some 'photo shoots'.    Overall experience was amazing... It was definitely a night to remember. oh yeah, and we saw the wine fairy retrieving wine, very entertaining.",

What I do remember was the meat duo I had -- it was a short rib with a piece of filet (I believe) and the sauces were very complimentary, but it wasn't something I'd expect from a restaurant of Aureole's caliber.  The beef duo at Chaya was much much better -- and that's saying something.  All in all, the atmosphere was great and the service was spectacular (it was also awesome that the wine list came on a tablet), but the food just didn't live up to the standards I had set.

    "text": "We went here for valentines days and had a wonderful experience. The wine list is amazing, I had a glass of champagne. The service was great, very attentive and had a nice demeanor. I had the macadamia nut crusted scallops with beets and my boyfriend had the crab stuffed chicken and we shared a side of mushrooms. The portions were just right for both of us and I loved how the mushrooms came with big chunks of roasted garlic. I had a graham cracker s'more dessert with chocolate and marshmallow spread. I see what people are saying about the \"stuffy\" atmosphere with the type of people I saw dining there but it didn't affect my experience. I was so excited to see the wine Angels go up the tower and being the wine! The wine tower is amazing to look at you get a great view when using the stairs as opposed to the elevator.",

The are very undeducated about the dishes they are serving.  They are socially awkward.   I could go on and on.  There are a ton of better dining options on the strip.  Look elswhere, trust me on this one.",

    "text": "It was a beautiful night and a good start to our anniversary.  We decided to celebrate by dining at Aureole, or the restaurant with the huge tower of wine. We ate in the court in which you can see the swans swimming in the pond.  It's about $95 per person for a four course meal.   Dinner:  food was ok.  I love food for starters, let me say this.  I love different flavors and such.  However, I wasn't too blown away by what was presented.  Don't get me wrong, the presentation was beautiful.  However, the food was so so.  The highlight was the beef tartare.  I thought that to be very delicious.  I did not care for either veal dish presented.  That was my least favorite.   The dessert was a duo of white chocolate and dark chocolate with mango sorbet.   The white chocolate dessert was delicious however i feel the mango should have been left completely off of the dark chocolate dessert.  I love the bitterness of dark chocolate and felt as though the mango did not pair well at all with this dish. Service:  I believe service could have been a bit more personable.  Our drinks were constantly refilled, but we barely saw our waiter except when being served our meal.  To his credit he explained each dish and what we were seeing--but I expected that.  What I was looking for we him to ask if everything was ok and if there was anything that could be changed--he only asked during the next to the last course.  Cocktails:  they definitely utilize premium liquor for these cocktails. All in all, it was a lovely dinner that definitely could have been better.  Our anniversary night wasn't ruined however, I did have high expectations for the food and service, especially for the price they charge.  Probably will not come back but at least it was an experience I can say I had.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing visit during Happy Hour intended to help us decide whether or not we would want to splurge on a full meal the following evening. We chose two items off of the HH menu:       - Barcelona Meatballs: gruyere, jamon iberico, creamy peppercorn suace      - Fried \"Chicken Oysters\": Lardo, spinach espuma, lemon butter  These both underwhelmed in big ways, for different reasons, and not just for execution issues. The meatballs, which as you'll notice, do not specify what type of meat is in them, are listed as \"Turkey, Ham and Swiss\" on the main menu. Here, those details were omitted. Regardless - they were void of flavor and almost completely bland. They had decent texture but seemed baked off at a super low temp and could have used a sear. There was nothing creamy about the sauce which didn't help the meatballs much, itself being just too bland. The jamon, and yes I know it's expensive, was a pretty small piece compared to the size of the meatballs. They were heavily garnished with chives that tasted more like spinach than chives and I thought detracted from the dish. I can make better meatballs in my sleep at home and by a fair margin - there was nothing unctuous or delicious about these by any stretch of the imagination. You'd be happier at Bucca di Beppo. There is a reason some combination of beef, pork and veal is most often used.  Ahh, fried chicken oysters - cool concept! If you've ever roasted a full chicken, you'll know these are the moistest and most wonderful two pieces you can get. So, imagine our displeasure to find that (1) all of the pieces in the dish had different levels of breading and far worse (2) they were all overcooked. And not just a bit overcooked. This is plainly and simply a dish that doesn't improve on the original in any way. Further, there was a buttermilk base to it not listed in the description, which while good, had too much cream for me. I was pretty shocked to taste this when two chicken oysters from a grocery store rotisserie chicken would be far superior. Taken together with the lemon butter and all components as intended, it was a nice bite of food but shouldn't have been put on the menu.  FWIW, I agree wholeheartedly with the chef below who said their food is undersalted. I eat a low salt diet, am extremely sensitive to salt and everything just read very blandly during our visit.  My cocktail was great which I was more than happy to pay $9 for and service was very good, as well. But when the food was this mediocre, happy hour prices or not, we won't be returning, and we certainly won't be risking $100-300 to eat here. Way too bad considering the new chef who has taken over at the helm with some great buzz about him. It was also really weird/awkward having the wine angel just sitting around by the server station in the bar area drinking an energy drink waiting for someone to order wine.",

    "text": "Another beautiful restaurant in Vegas. The ambiance and decor of this place is so chic and modern. As you first walk in you will notice the gigantic wine tower.  If you can afford one of the super expensive wine bottles stored in this 4 stories tower, they will hook up a \"wine angel\" to a wire, and she will glide up the tower to retrieve your bottle. Unfortunately no one ordered the wine. I believe there are 5 dining rooms with 5 distinct personality including main room and lounge.  We came last night during happy hour from 9:30pm-11:30pm.   The Happy hour has a list of about 11 things which are $8 each. The server told us the Kobe sliders was good. My friends had French onion soup,Tuna Poke. I had the mango-papaya imperial rolls which I wasn't too blown away but the Enlightenment cocktail was very good. Enjoyed my time there!",

    "text": "I was only able to give this restaurant 1 star, based on the fact that we never even got served.  The hostess sat us at a table in the lounge, and we waited 20 minutes and were never given menus, water or even a polite \"be right with you\". Four different service staff made eye contact with me, and then looked away with no action. I even attempted to get up and track someone down with no success.  It seemed steady in the restaurant, and everyone may have been busy, but that is no excuse when the tables all around you (sat around 2-3 minutes after you) already had menus and at least water.  We got up and left. As we walked out, we let the hostess know, and all she asked was if we spoke to a manager on the floor. Considering we couldn't get anyone to speak with us, except her, we just left without so much as an apology.  I would love to go back and try the restaurant, but if this is the service given on a Tuesday...i can't imagine what I may encounter on a peak night. I suggest making a reservation, because while they allow walk-ins you obviously only get a table to look at the food and wine being served all around you.",

The food was amazing and I wanted to try everything. What got my attention was being a guest at Mandalay Bay Hotel where they are located and walked past their impressive 4 story wine rack.  I started off with happy hour in their bar and cocktail room with friends while we waited for our table to be prepared. All of the appetizers and drinks were delicious.  For dinner I had the roast duck, and my friends all has something different.  The wine list is extensive and all pricey so be prepared to spend a chunk of your bill on the wine.  I would definitely go back the next time I pop into Las Vegas.",

Directions: To begin, the restaurant is located in Mandalay Bay. To get there, enter in through the main doors and continue to the left of the casino. Upon entering you'll find a large glass wine storage vault extending 3 floors. Follow the spiral staircase around the wine vault and check in at the front desk.  Ambiance: Really nice but very classy and casual. The wine vault is really amazing and you can watch as a gymnast/ trapeze artist/ waitress ascends and descents hoisted by a wire harness to retrieve your wine.  Food: My group opted to order the 8 course parallel pairing with two bottles of wine. Roughly our bill came out to $120. The meal was... incredible. Dinner was served in 4 courses where each contained a unifying ingredient prepared in two vary different ways. As I expect the menu regularly changes, briefly some highlights were: Corn chowder with a ginger sauce, blood orange salmon gravlax ricotta lobster ravioli, and a grape a goat cheese tart. All were amazing and to be able to taste how a single ingredient could be prepared in such different ways was wonderful. Needless to say, we were all very full upon completing our meals and were very content.  Wine: The wine collection is extensive.  Happy Eating my friends. Stay hungry!",

Check in with the hostess was quick and you can take the elevator or walk down the lighted stairs, able to view the venue corner-to-corner: Super Chic, Romantic lighting. Five of us took numerous photos by the beautiful entrance and staircase before we were escorted to our round table, seated comfortably.   Ordered bubbles, white/red and bloody mary. We started with the Hudson Valley Foie Gras (no need to explain, just plain \"Good\"), Seasoned Seafood Platter served on chilled ice of fresh clams, oysters, tuna poke, tiger shrimp, crab claws, and a bowl of French puff onion soup with Foie Gras/truffles *YUUUM*.  Main Course: we had the18 Oz Bone In Rib-eye (RARE), Diver scallops was super sweet, Niman Ranch Double Pork Chop was a huge portion and juicy, Wild Striped Bass. We could barely finish our food and still got free dessert to go with our coffee and cappucino/ice-cream...Superb!",

The portions were just right in order to be able to feel full in the end. The cost is $145. We did not choose the wine pairing which would have cost another $95 on top of the $145 and instead just ordered one glass of Pinot Noir which was delicious. It started with a very nice beef carpaccio, followed by an absolutely delicious scallop,  followed by fois gras with waffle and strawberry, leading to an incredibly delicious Seabass and then one had a choice between the duck or lamb and I chose the lamb which was delicious. The dessert was a delicious pannacotta that was just too beautiful to look at. Overall, it was a good meal. I was not crazy about the fois gras and have had better yet otherwise it was lovely. The service was outstanding, the ambience relaxing, and the restaurant is beautiful. I would have given this 4 1/2 stars but it lost half a star because of the meal that I mentioned that wasn't as good. For the amount of money paid, I would've expected each part of the meal to be outstanding. Regardless, would easily go back as absolutely delicious.",

Mandalay isn't very busy and I think this restaurant would be busier if it was located in cosmopolitan or bellagio or somewhere else hot and center strip....Saturday night the restaurant was about 1/3 to 1/2 full. We decided to go mostly veggie having the spaghetti squash, veggie lasagna, beet salad, and for meat - the short rib ravioli that was with a creamy tomato sauce and cheese. Great wine list, attentive service on a fine dining level, one disappointment was we ordered a wine and got the ravioli before our wine. Our wine was in the cellar. Well they did give us half glasses to tide us over but that was 10 mins after we got the ravioli. Other than that wonderful service, all of the food we tried was excellent and the decor is really dramatic and refined. Bathrooms are gorgeous also",

I originally booked for the Stripsteak however they closed earlier than what I expected! After searching the available fine dining options at Mandalay Bay I ran across this place. Booked a 10:15 pm reservation and upon arrival was greeted immediately as well as seated! The ambiance of the place is spectacular! No complaints at all a nice wine tower that greets you as your walking in and just WOW. The winding glass staircase is amazing and you just feel like you're walking into heaven sort a speak. The waiter we had was awesome customer service was great! He had strong recommendations as well as great hospitality! Now on to the food.. No appetiZers or drinks just went straight for the entrees! Colorado rack of lambs ($65) and the 18 oz ribeye ($63) my rack of lamb was excellent and I wanted to try something different but wow for $65 it sure was a baby lamb.. Skip the Mac n cheese for $12 it was AWFUL! I could've made a better batch at home from the velveeta box..The ribeye we ended up sending back because my partner said it was on the level of Outback Steakhouse lol and just the preparation and presentation of it was OFF! We are steak people so we know when a steak is being short changed and this one was terrible! So terrible that we sent it back with an exchange for a filet with a lobster to top it off! Definitely made up for the joke of a ribeye!  All in all not sure if I would return but it was fun to try out..",

You really can't go wrong with sitting by the four story wine rack to watch the wine angels, but choosing a table at the back to watch the fountains is fantastic as well.  The service here was top notch, and so was the food. I ordered the main lobster and fettuccine pasta and it was incredible. My friend had the 8 oz. filet which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We are from Kansas City, so it can be hard to impress us with a steak anywhere else, but this place accomplished it! For sides, we order potato noisette and brussel sprouts and shared them both, they both were delicious and well done. The wine list here is extensive, so you may want to go with at least an idea of what kind of wine you would like to order for the evening. The ice cream and sorbet dessert assortment was fresh, unique and well put together. Overall, this is a place we will likely visit each time we come to Vegas.

He was super friendly, wonderfully knowledgeable, and very understanding of what kind of wine would accommodate all of our tastes.  I came here with two other girls and we all ordered off of the Michael Jackson experience dining menu (this was in the summer). Every course was superb. It was cooked to perfection and had me savoring every bite. I was in food heaven.  What was truly spectacular, though, was that we were fortunate enough to be invited back to the kitchen and meet all of the chefs. It was a slower night, so we were able to get a peek behind the scenes. Needless to say, some of the nicest people I've ever met AND fantastic at their jobs. Honestly, probably my favorite and most unforgettable dining experience ever.",

If you don't want to read the rest, simply know that going to this place provides an exceptional dining experience.  Our group was about eight people, and we were seated in a nice corner near the rear windows. Every staff person from the person who took our reservation out front to the head waiter was like your own personal servant. Our primary waiter was just like Nathan Lane, in appearance, comedic demeanor, and professionalism that exudes high-class even if he is sharing a joke with a kid in jeans and a T-shirt (which is basically what I was wearing).  We ordered from across the dinner and drinks menu and everything tasted wonderful and was cooked perfectly. They also had some special set meal choices that are an excellent deal for the price. I particularly liked their cheese and honeycomb appetizers. Their desserts are rich and flavorful, and taste much better than the same sort of desserts at other restaurants.  If you're going to pick a fancy restaurant to dine at in Las Vegas, I recommend this restaurant. There are other restaurants that are similar in price but provide no where near the quality of atmosphere, staff, and food as Aureole.",

Defiantly a dessert I will not forget, SO GOOD!",

I ordered the blue cheese crusted filet mignon (medium rare) which was hands down the best steak I've had in my life. We loved our waiter - Gustavo. He was very personable and went out of his way to accommodate us. The rest of the restaurant staff were very hospitable as well. One of my friends was celebrating her birthday so we asked the host to have some dessert sent out. They sent out a complementary gelato plate for the whole table! I also had a phone conversation with the Assistant Manager, Aaron, who was fantastic as well. I would highly suggest visiting this restaurant if you are in Vegas - I will definitely be returning on my next trip!",

Why do you hostesses do this? Besides that unsettling comment, it was perfect. Bountiful breads, wonderful cavier, except it saddened me that they didn't offer Champagne by the glass to pair with it. I wouldn't really expect them to, but it would have been nice to have since I wasn't going to order a bottle for just myself! I settled for the only appropriate sparkling wine they offered by the glass instead. The service was simply outstanding and the staff was very attentive and extremely accomadating with special requests, as they should be. The salad (caprese style) melted in my mouth, and the salmon was perfection. The little mini desserts were the icing on the cake.",

Couches were VERY comfortable. I got their $4 Illy coffee (a small cup) and it was surprisingly good - better than Starbucks. I would have totally forked over another $4 for another cup.

I was actually here about 9 years prior - the food was spectacular and worth every penny.  I just went again (11/1/08), and I must say the chef has gotten lazy.  The menu was far from seasonal, I'd question the quality of the food and overall just not worth it given the other superior dining options in Las Vegas.  The chef (Palmer) needs to climb out of the rut he's in and get their menu back on track.  As mentioned above, the wine list and the decor, exceptional.  Stop by for a few glasses and see the wine tower, however move on somewhere else for dinner - we also ate at Social House in TI this past visit - food quality was out of this world - just one of many places to eat.",

The staff are nearly perfect all the time, and you can see them being managed by this gentleman who looks quite the perfectionist (and whose bad side I wouldn't want to be on).  Yes, it is a tad austere, cold and corporate, but then perhaps I'm not so different myself (at least in some respects).  In any event, I feel very much at home here.  Everyone knows the wine list is extensive and the tower an interesting bit of theatre.  But that isn't such a big deal.  But think about the \"tuna composition.\"  Excuse the dollop of yuzu ice cream on it.  Put it aside and out of your mind.  The tuna tartare is truly at the top of of all tuna tartares.  It almost (not quite) reaches the height of the original tuna tartare from Aqua.  The three way smoked salmon appetizer was also great.  The smoked buttery salmon was just perfect.  The John Dory entree was good, though a slightly more crispy (perhaps pan fried preparation) would have been better.  The black cod was great, but only about 30% of the size of the John Dory.  It looked more like an appetizer.  Someone might need to think a bit about portion size.  I'm not really a dessert person.  Frankly, I should have ordered another tuna composition for dessert.  I always regret not ordering more fish.  The desserts were fine, but my dessert opinion doesn't mean much.  So, I'm not sure I understand some of the more negative reviews I see for Aureole.  But, to each his own.",

The service (or shall I say server) was mainly the issue. From start to finish, our server was pushy toward our large group and left in the blink of an eye after he said everything he wanted to say without giving anyone a chance to really respond or say anything back. He got the wrong order, neglected to bring some order, and bragged to us about how he didn't charge for the dessert that came out since it was a birthday celebration. I thought restaurants didn't really charge for a birthday dessert in the first place? It was very hard to speak up at the time because our parents were wanting to have a good time and keep the spirits up and not be downers. We were all definitely boiling inside, but to be considerate to the establishment, we didn't really speak our frustrations until after the dining experience had ended. The interesting thing to note was that when we did go to the manager to share our experience that night, she didn't really do anything to help the situation except told us that \"next time, we should speak up during the dining\".

You can request one of the booths near the back windows and it's like you're in the restaurant all by yourself!   The food is incredible and well worth the price. I'd highly recommend the meat - we had the lamb and the fillet mignon and both were incredible. We ordered a few sides: broccoli and rice and both were delicious and well sized to share. We shared the dessert sampler plate which was one of the best desserts I've ever had. We had a mix of chocolate and fruit and hot and cold dishes - all very yummy!  The wine list is the BEST PART. You get an ipad and you can read about your wine selections on the application the restaurant uses. If you really care about your wine sourcing, you can also go and watch the \"angels\" (women strung up to the ceiling of the vertical wine cellar) hand-pick your wine. Very cool. The Sommelier was great and helped navigate me through the app to the best choices for our meals.  A great experience - enjoy!",

First thing you'll notice as you step in is the huge wine tower and the wine angels to retrieve the wine (pretty awesome mini-show!). The restaurant is elegant, as many Las Vegas establishments are, with a soft ambiance.   Service was, for the most part, quick and attentive. We had a very cheerful waiter who took noticeable care with handling our orders. Our wine waiter was, however, a bit cold and emotionless in explaining how the wine selection worked. They give you an electronic tablet with an extensive wine list, allowing you to filter by many categories.   The food is amazing. I started with the Peruvian ceviche, onion soup, oysters, and ahi tuna tartar. The ceviche was one of the best I've ever had,  with a nice tang. I loved the tuna tartar and the oysters, but wasn't crazy about the onion soup. For our entrees, we had grilled swordfish and alaskan halibut with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic. My swordfish was delicious, but her halibut was a bit salty. The potatoes was very good. Since we were stuffed, we declined dessert other than tea, but they rewarded us with a complimentary little dessert platter with assorted cakes.   Overall, we loved this place and will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas.",

The service was attentive without being over the top. The beef short and shallots were good but I was expecting a bit more from a wasabi pomme puree.   It is a fun place to dine at because of the wine tower and the wine selection being on Ipads.",

    "text": "I just wish I had checked Yelp before we went here.  I saw that it had a one-star Michelin rating in 2009 and got a reservation.  If I had seen that the food and service were so up and down, we wouldn't have paid the price.    To start with, they should have a regular written wine list for people who don't care to go through the multiple menus on the I-Pad based wine list they stick you with.  Too much work for that time of night.  We each had a glass of wine from their by-the-glass menu.  Good, but not great wine.  They bring by a bread plate, and you can choose what type you want.  We had a roll with cherrys in it.  Tasted like a cinnamon-raisin bagel.  A little stale.  Also some wheat bread.  Meh.  I got the french onion soup to start.  After the first one came out luke-warm and I had to send it back, it actually was amazing.  Instead of a soggy piece of bread and cheese floating in soup like you usually get, they made a pot-pie looking thing with crispy, cheesey top crust that you can break off with your spoon and dip in the soup as you want it.  Really good!  I had the sea bass, and my wife had the pork chop.  The waiter tried to give me the pork chop.  Who can blame him?  No self-respecting guy gets the fish when there's a pork chop to be had.  Woops.  I had to send that back too, because it was bordering on cold.  My wife's pork chop was very good, with a nice smoky flavor, but as we shared it waiting for the fish to come back, we realized that hers was pretty cold too.  It just didn't matter so much with the pork chop.   When the fish came (hot this time) I enjoyed it, but there was no WOW moment.  It was good fish on a pretty good rice base.  As we thought about it, the pork chop was pretty much the same.  No Wow.  Good, but nothing special.  The manager felt bad about our luke-warm food, so he offered us a free desert.  I was stuffed at that point, so I asked for a single scoop of sherbet.  They brought us four deserts!  I guess this was to try to make up for the lack of everything else, but it just gave us a chance to try all the deserts and realize that they didn't measure up either.    The fried apple ring thing was pretty tasteless.  The Sherbet was good.  The cookie taster plate was - good, not great.  I can't remember what else they brought.  That should tell you how good it was.  To sum it up, the whole experience was...good, not great.  But expensive.  I'm not recommending it.",

It was dusty, and after waiting for 3 minutes, got in, and it didn't go anywhere. Stairs please.   Then, we sat at a table in the bar (which was mostly empty) and waited about 5 minutes for anyone to come over...not to mention there were random forks and knives on our table (like 10 of them).   Finally, someone came over and we ordered drinks and 2 apps. 15 minutes later, the food came before our drinks. We asked about it and the guy said \"oops\" and ran off to get them, which had been sitting at the bar for that long so now they were watery.   The food was just so so. No flavor. We had artichoke hearts (boring) and a carpaccio that was seriously bland. We actually sent it back. Then the waiter felt bad so stood there and talked to us for literally 10 minutes (I just wanted to leave).   Poor service (and no, they weren't even busy), dull food. Will NOT be going back.   PS: The bar is downstairs but is open space, so you can see down there from the main walkway at Mandalay. The chatty waiter told us drunk people sometimes drop bottles/drinks from the top balcony right onto the bar. Uh...bad food and a concussion? No thanks.",

I eat a lot and I was satisfied before dessert.  You are directed around the infamous wine tower to the second hostess station where your table is prepared within five minutes (even if you have reservations).    I think we had a small army of three or four people waiting on our table.  The somellier with his iPad device of wine to order from and there when needed if you have questions or need to be topped off.  We had a waiter to explain the menu and take orders.  Then there was the person or two who brought the food to the table.  Then the manager circulating.  This is a the definition of hospitality.  Food had the highest quality of ingredients, cook to perfection, all with fresh energetic flavors, and you were really able to taste the meat and each individual ingredient.    The food was affordable for what you were given.  I feel they had more $200-$400 bottle of wines than $200 and under and it was a bit tough to find a reasonable bottle that would be perfect with everything.  Thats why we got two.  Caaching.  A must see in Vegas and of course NYC.",

The ambiance and decor are fantastic both inside and out.  The ceiling is a vaulted 3-4 story tall ceiling and there's a glass wine case in the center of the building running up to the ceiling. You'll have to take a look at the picture section to view this beautiful wine case.  The food was a work of art and is the best I've ever had. Every course was so flavorful and delicious.

My onion soup was almost cold when it came out, its replacement warm at best and the foie gras was undetectable.  The rack of lamb was cooked well but literally nothing that came with the dish, down to the sauce, was any good or honestly made any sense at all.    As a restaurant Aureole is a disappointment.  They do have a massive wine selection though, so if you're flush with cash and craving a '96 Dom or the like and don't mind paying 4x market value for it, have at.  Just don't get anything else lest you be disappointed.  Even the bread was cold.",

    "text": "This was featured on some travel show because of their super tall wine tower and \"wine angels.\"  It's pretty cool watching the two women suspended by wires going up and down to fetch wine.  Their wine list is also computerized - they give you something that looks like an iPad rather than a paper menu.  The ambiance is nice and the food is good but nothing wowed me. However, our server Ronaldo, left much to be desired as we found him to be brusque and somewhat rude.  We came in using a gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>, so maybe that's why we got shabby treatment.  Obviously the restaurant is in need of new customers, which is they they had the certificate offered on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> to begin with.  My friend ordered a glass of wine (Chardonnay - $12) and I drank tap.  After we ordered our entrees, the waiter asked, \"And for your first course?\"  A more diplomatic way he could have asked if we were ordering appetizers could have been, \"Will you be ordering anything else?\"  I found it to be pretty rude and pushy to assume we would be ordering appetizers.  Sorry, but since when is it expected that you order a certain amount when dining out?  I would have tipped him much less than I did, except that we were waited on by various ppl, so I assumed they shared the tip and I did not want to stiff some of the others who were quite nice (the bread man, the man who refilled our glasses).  We were also largely ignored after our entrees came.  No one asked how our dinner was and we had to wait at least 10 minutes after our dishes were cleared to get dessert menus hastily thrown at us.  As a result, we did not order any dessert due to the treatment we got.   I noticed the table next to us did not get serviced very well either, even though the guy ordered a $200 bottle of wine.  However, I did notice that someone asked them if they would like to have their picture taken, and they declined.  No one asked us if we'd like our picture taken!!    As far as the food goes, the seafood is fresh but I doubt it's sustainable.  The scallops were succulent and large; my black cod was tender.  The corn succotash was good but not $8 worth.  I think it had like two beans in it - they call that succotash??  I loved the bread!  I got the pretzel bread (my favorite) and some bacon tasting bread, which was also good.    I won't be back, with or without a coupon.  Aureole should really hire nicer waiters or at least train the ones they have better.",

The service was great without being overbearing, the decor was modern but it didn't look very fancy, and the food was pretty good. If you like wine you'll probably like this restaurant.  You order wine off of the electronic wine menu, there's the famous wine tower inside the restaurant, and they have wine pairing with the food.   We ordered the 3 course and 4 course pre fixe meal.  The 3 course meal was pretty basic: a light salad, beef on top of mashed potatoes, and a banana dessert. What's nice is that the portion size was large and I was full at the end of the meal. The salad and beef were pretty good, but the banana dessert was delicious! I'm not a dessert person and this is the only dessert I can say I ever loved! The 4 course had 2 dishes per course, the presentation was nice (but I didn't try all the courses).    One thing to note is that the executive chef does not work on Mondays.",

    "text": "Let's face it - when you go to Vegas, it's all over the top. It's not enough to be a great restaurant. You need a gimmik to make it noteworthy and to stand apart from the competition. Chef Charlie Palme's Aureole has chosen wine as their over the top signature statement.  I could talk about the food, but I would have to say it's about par with the rest of the Vegas scene. Good juicy steaks, etc. I was dining on a prix fixe menu, as I was with a large group. My options were typical (an ahi appetizer, a filet, and a nice dessert). So my knowledge of the menu is limited, but I was very happy with what they offered, and my meal.  Now, let's jump to the fun part - their take on wine.  Aureole decided not to bury their 10,000 + bottles of wine selections in a basement or cellar. Instead, they opted to encase it in an acrylic tower that spans four stories (42 feet) through the center of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you pass by this absolutely amazing tower of wine, displayed for all to see - from all four sides.   Yes, it's cool to look at. But even MORE COOL? How they retrieve the wine. A beautiful woman, dressed in a sleek black leotard is hoisted up like a trapeze artist for every bottle. She is referred to as the \"Wine Angel\" and she's absolutely delightful to watch. Every time a bottle of wine is ordered, it's retrieved by the Wine Angel. She's a mesmerizing acrobat as she flies up within the encased tower, plucking your order out of her acrylic Heavens.  You can also ask for the \"wine tablet\" which is an electronic wine menu. It sounds cooler than it is - as it had a bad user interface. I'd prefer to tip the wine angel $20.00 & tell her to reach for something tasty!  Overall - review? Do go to Aureole once - or at least walk in to see it. The wine angel is something we've all dreamed about!!",

    "text": "We ended up at Aureole Las Vegas for a company event last Friday night (I know, my life is awful). I started in the bar with a tangerine mojito, which was one of those drinks that tasted delicicous and benign to boot, until I reached the bottom and realized, um, there might have been a little rum in that wee glass. Oopsie.  Cracking on, since our party was pretty large we had a set menu in a private dining room. While I was disappointed not to be able to watch the wine angels scurry up and down, it was probably best that we had our own space to yammer away in.  Am I allowed to rave about bread in this day and age? Aureole serves these petite, warm, dark rolls that taste exactly like hot pretzels. It's possible I had 2. Cue sound of Atkins turning in grave.  I'm ashamed to say that my first course was a beet salad - SHOCKER - one of my favorite places to start. This one was tasty, though not especially memorable, possibly since by then I was already on my second glass of '99 Brunello. If you're an oenophile, by the way, arrive 20 minutes before your rezzo and ask for the wine last, an electronic tablet which allows you to scrolls through their deep, expensive but fantastic wine list.   Out came the mains, and my plate featured salmon with pancetta, cooked to perfection. But wow, that brunello was really kicking in by now so don't ask me to reel off side items. All I recall is it that it was extremely tasty.  For dessert, I bucked the trend of my table and had a meyer lemon tart. Should have gone with the chocolate souffle. It was fine enough but reminded me of the lemon curd my granny used to offer me to put on my toast.  Between the salmon, the wine, the company, and that surreally good bread, I had a pretty splendid meal. The app and dessert were fine, though nothing outstanding. I'd go again to sit outside in the main restaurant - especially if someone else was paying.",

It looked very cool when the waitresses got the wine in the cellar because it looked like they were on air and the walls of the cellar are all glass.  We didn't have reservations but we were lucky enough to get a table for 2 that friday night.    The staff is very attentive.  I loved the selection of bread. I kept asking for more. I felt bad but hey!  good bread at a restaurant always gets to me. can't get enough of it!  It was nice of the chef cook to give us complimentary dishes and desserts too.  The layout of every dish were fantastic, very classy, and clean.    Definitely a good definition of fine dining in vegas!",

    "text": "Good but not that great.  We did the tasting menu in the \"swan court\", which means that you pay ten dollars more to be in a room with some swans outside.  Given that it was dark outside, this felt like a particularly stupid feature.  I asked if it was possible to split a wine pairing, and was quickly rebuked.  I've asked for that and had no problems in many other places.  Oh well.  The dinner started with a trio of amuses.  One of them was a bacon-wrapped scallop that was okay.  I don't remember the others.  The bacon they served with the beef was the most amazing I've ever had.  Incredibly crisp, but not overcooked.  The server was happy to explain the vast effort they go to make it, curing it themselves, cooking it low and slow between sheets of some absorbing paper that gets rid of the grease.  The duo of beef had some flat-iron that was dry and completely over-done, which was odd.  Dessert was okay; they brought a trio of sorbets and asked us to guess what they were.  We got two of them, but unsurprisingly pomegranate-cherry was a hard one.  We left feeling overly full but with none of the wonder we had when leaving L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, which was more expensive, but SO much better.  I won't come back here, and would suggest other places over this.  My brother came here a while ago and absolutely loved it, as he said service was great, which I definitely didn't get.",

    "text": "This was an amazing place to go for ambiance, style, and for us, very attentive staff.  The somellier was great, carefully helping us find the right wines in our budget that would complement the food well. I didn't even know that Italy had a good cab franc!  We got to meet the wine angel that pulled our wine for us, which was a treat for the guys at our table.  The food was uneven.  Some of the dishes were stellar, worthy of lots of praise and just wonderful to eat. Others were just okay.  Nothing was bad, per se.  The bread options were amazing, and if you aren't Kosher, you MUST try to bacon roll.  We did the tasting menu, as one of the people in our group had a good night at the tables.  Note: you may need a good night at the tables to pay for it, but if you love food and the pomp around food, it may be worth it for you.  We were a fairly chatty crew, and we did not feel out of place, but a quiet elegant dinner would be equally possible there as well.  Why isn't it 5 stars? The uneven-ness of quality of food definitely was a detractor. I also find it odd to have different prices for the same meal depending upon where you sit in the building.  Finally, the prices were quite steep, though I give massive kudos for the wine list, which could serve just about any budget.",

    "text": "Wow ... where do I begin? From the awesome wine tower that requires a circus act to reach many of the bottles, to the ambiance, and of course the fabulous food - most amazing.  We were lucky to be in Vegas during Restaurant Week so every dining establishment offered special prix fixe menus for $50 so we took advantage of that. The appetizer selection said \"choose two per person\" but we figured, no way ... but indeed, it was True. They weren't small plates either -- the appetizers alone (we had the hoisin-style calamari, ceviche, steak and naan, and artichoke dip) filled us up with goodness. But we had to get through two regular-sized main entrees (I had the porcini and artichoke ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale) and totally forgot they came with sides until those were set a few minutes later -- yeesh.   Oh, and a quartet of desserts to end with -- what can I say? Top it off with impeccable service, and you have quite the winner.   The only \"complaint\" I have (and I don't know if it even falls as one) is that the waiter assured us these plates were small since, after all, it is a tasting menu -- and as I said, if those were tasting plates, they must've been from Green Giant land. I get full thinking about this meal.",

We sat near the back, and when you look outside you see swans swimming. The wine list is on something like a Kindle. It's a 3 course dinner without wine for $85, they had a special parallel 4 course dinner for $95 where Charlie Palmer would combine 2 different types of courses and somehow make it blend together which my friend ordered.   I started off with the tuna tartare and I thought it was ok because it had this cream that reminded me of honeydew sorbet. My bf got the caviar (which is an extra $80) and it came with toast and bellini's (basically they were little mini pancakes). Other people in my party ordered the french onion soup which came with a puff pastry on top. For my entree, I got the sea bass and I thought the texture was soft and buttery but lacking a bit in flavor. My bf got the bone in rib eye and it was much better. We got asparagus, mushrooms, mac and cheese and corn for sides. The corn was the best because it had a smoky flavor to it.   Last course was dessert and i chose the dessert sampler- it came with nutella creme brulee, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and this light cake thing with blueberry creme on top which was my favorite. They gave us extra sorbet and extra little desserts. All in all the food was ok to me but the decor was one of the most beautiful I have seen.",

    "text": "Aureole was kind of a nice experience.    The gentlemen who filled our water glasses and brought the bread tray was very nice.  The manager who checked on us towards the end of meal was also very friendly.  The sommelier was GREAT and helped us pick a bottle we both really enjoyed from their electronic wine list (which was fun).  We couldn't see if they sent the wine angel up to get it because we weren't seated near the wine tower.  Which brings me to where we were sitting.  We were seated in the \"Swan Terrace,\" although we did not request this and I wasn't too familiar with the fact that there were different \"areas\" at all.  Now it's kind of cool that there are swans, but the room comes with restrictions on what you can order.  Most importantly they don't even offer you the a la carte menu--you have to order a three course meal. We were both thinking about a tasting menu anyway, so this wasn't a huge deal.  But my guy had seen their advertisement outside the restaurant for the three course \"Harvest Menu,\" which is made with fresh seasonal produce, and he wanted that.  When our server came over, we asked why it wasn't on the menu, and he said it was only served in the \"other\" dining room.  When we looked surprised, he said he'd get it for us, but made it clear he was doing us a favor.  I found this altogether bizarre--if you're going to place restrictions like that, why not warn patrons first?  Why not offer them a table in the \"other\" dining room as well?  The restaurant was not full, so it seemed like they were trying to force us to order from only the two most expensive tasting menus.  Also, afterward, I looked at their web site, and apparently we paid MORE for the exact SAME food just by virtue of our presence in the swan room.  And at no point did we REQUEST swans or even have the swan option explained to us.   Now, having read some reviews, I see that there are supposed to be little swan-based extras, but we didn't see any of that.  I saw other tables getting an amuse bouche, which we were not served.  Also, our actual server kind of put a damper on the whole evening because he was just pretentious.  We're really friendly diners, but he could hardly spare a smile and paid us as little attention as possible. Shouldn't you put your friendliest (or at least, your least snobby) waiter in the special swan room?   Now, the food itself was beautiful and delicious.  Charlie Palmer knows how to put together a menu.  And the quality of the food explains the Michelin Star.  I had some delicious butternut squash ravioli with brown butter and snow crab.  We both had steak dishes.  And the desserts were pretty and yummy.  And we enjoyed the blueberry margarita from the bar as well as the wine.  I did think it was a little weird that they circulated the bread on a tray but didn't bother to heat any of it up.  But because they put bacon INSIDE their focaccia, I won't quibble.    A few days later, after considering our whole Aureole experience, I don't think we'll be repeat visitors.  It's a very expensive restaurant to begin with, so you want to have a good memory there.  And I just can't help feeling taken advantage of with the whole swan business.  And when your waiter is snotty to you, it doesn't matter how nice everyone else is or how delicious the food is. It really just kills the evening.",

    "text": "Ambiance and decor (wine tower) 5, Service (had to ask for menu, utensils, bill) 1, Food 2  So after getting seated, our group had to request menus after being ignored for about 10 minutes.  They (we had 2 servers) came out with wine and cocktail menus first (maybe hoping we'd drink too much so that we wouldn't notice how slow the service was).  After finally getting menus and ordering, we were served a nice selection of breads.  When the food came out, everyone got their entrees except me so we nicely asked the waitress to check on the order for us.  When the waiter returned with my swordfish, he said that the reason they didn't bring my dish was because we had switched seats and the servers sent my dish back when they saw food already present at my original seat.  I couldn't decide whether he was just presenting an excuse or being accusatory, but I wasn't sure why they didn't just ask me if that extra entree was mine since I didn't have any food in front of me.  After I started to eat my fish, I was very impressed with the way it was seasoned.  However as I started to get to the middle of the filet, I noticed that it wasn't fully cooked.  So I asked the waitress if this type of fish was supposed to be served this way and she claimed that it was how the chef liked to prepare it, but if I wanted to she could take it back (hubby and foodie then tells me that swordfish is supposed to be fully cooked).  So after getting my fish back, I was only able to eat the outside parts because the middle was still not cooked.  At that point, I was full on the mini vegetables so I didn't ask for them to try again.  I was thinking that they would get a 1 star rating from me, but sadly I must confess that I can be easily bribed with desserts.  The waitress had seen my disappointment (and uneaten fish) and said she would send out some sorbet that is made in house.  She ended up sending out sorbet and ice cream and I found them very light and flavorful!  Voila!  They gain back a star!    So, the final say is...If you're a wine drinker (which I'm not), you would probably want to try it for that reason because their selection is pretty vast.  Not to mention the gimmicky wine faeries are fun to watch as they fetch your order.  Otherwise, save the $120-200 for the slots because who knows, you could get to spin on the wheel of fortune machines or win Megabucks! ;)",

They have a very limited selection of wines by the glass and half bottles.  However, it seems their strong point are the wines by the bottle.  They have their main wine list on a tablet PC.  I would actually tell them you want to see their bottle list just so you can play with the tablet.  Also, their dessert wines by the glass aren't listed on the paper menu, so if you are looking for a dessert wine, ask for the tablet.  I was surprised that the bar area was so quiet on a Friday evening.  It worked fine for me as I wanted a quiet place to chill before dinner.  Service was okay and the bartender even game me a sample of a great prosecco after he discovered that I like sweeter wines.  Overall, I liked trying this place out.

As a result, the restaurant seemed to have a more relaxed setting. We ordered wine, not only because we enjoy wine, but also, we were eager to see our wine \"fairy\" acrobat grab our wine from the glass wine tower, which was so swift but still entertaining.   My college friend, Sara, was celebrating her birthday so special attention was given to her and she was even awarded a sorbet dessert at the end of our meal! Unique flavors like guava, Berry lemonade, and cotton candy, if I remember correctly, were refreshing palatal delights! This dessert was a surprise and she still ordered that famous salted almond truffle tart covered in chocolate butter. We all loved this!  I was fairly adventurous and also ordered a fois gras martini that had black truffle cotton candy mixed into it. I really wish I snagged a photo before the waiter mixed it because it was definitely a Dr. Seussian looking mix. It kind of had the texture of drinking egg nog.   Rewinding to dinner: Beef and Octopus Carpaccio - the Octopus was sliced so thinly that you barely noticed you were eating Octopus. Each slice was delicately placed in the center of the thinly sliced beef carpaccio. It took some talent to put the two together seamlessly. Pretty decent sharing appetizer overall.  Roasted beet and goat cheese appetizer - goat cheese always harmonizes well with salad type appetizers. This goes the same for beets!  Filet mignon and braised beef shoulder - I'm typically used to filets being pan cooked in butter or oil or both, but this filet had the slight taste of being on a grill. I'd also never had it with braised beef shoulder. I think the fact that it was served with mushrooms and bread pudding won me over.  4x Seared 16oz Bone In Ribeye - my hubby said it's probably one of the best he's had. Prepared medium rare to rare.   Lamb Loin - very tender and flavorful. Just a hint of gamey which was only enough to discern that you were eating lamb and not beef. Super good.  Saffron Seafood Risotto - Sara's choice. We adored this dish. Some risottos are too runny and some too thick but like Goldilock's would always find, this one was \"just right!\" It was stocked with prawns, clams, mussels, and crab. Most places give you 3 to 5 pieces of seafood and the rest is risotto but Aureole did not skim on the serving. We all had some of Sara's dish and she still was filled to the brim with food! This dish was excellent!  The service was great. We never felt rushed yet the timing was good on clearing the table for the next course so that there was never a dull lull in the evening. Everyone was courteous and the food was great. I definitely return especially if we stay at Mandalay again.",

The sea bass was sweet, tender and went so well with the delicate soba noodles and bok choy. The short rib ravioli a culinary delight! Bursting with flavor, but not too salty or overpowering. The dark chocolate brownie with salted caramel sauce and cinnamon ice cream literally melted on our mouths.   The centerpiece of Auerole is the 4 story wine tower. Hannah retrieved our wine like a gymnast, suspended from a cable doing backbends. We enjoyed a delicious chablis that perfectly complemented our meal.  The dining room is elegant and classy, but contemporary and not stuffy. If really is a beautiful restaurant that is perfect for any occasion that you'd like to enjoy with a date, friends or even colleagues.  The price is reasonable for being such a nice restaurant.  We love Auerole and will continue to come here when we visit Las Vegas. FiIt's a great place for dinner before the Michael Jackson One show at the Mandalay Bay.",

The service was exceptional and the ambiance was a great experience.  It just happened to be restaurant week so we all ordered the deal which was $50 bucks and included appetizer,  main courses,  and dessert.  They served this delicious aromatic bread made with rosemary served with garlic butter. I ordered the beef ravioli as an appetizer, asparagus risotto as a main course,  and creme brulee for dessert. Their cocktail menu is reasonably priced and they have a variety of wines to choose from in this vault that's 3 stories high.  They have a girl who literally gets hooked up to cords and flies up to grab the bottle of wine. Very nice restaurant to have an intimate date.  My coworkers ordered crab salad as an appetizer, salmon for the main course, and chocolate souffle for dessert. The restaurant in located down stairs from the main floor. You'll have to take an elevator down or stairs.  I highly recommend making a reservation. The restaurant is located in front of Kumi, the sushi restaurant.",

Don't get me wrong - the waiter was super nice, very accomodating, but he was SLAMMED and had over 12-15 tables + the bar to take care of. He did as best he could, but we didn't get our food for over 1.5 hours. HOURS!  Sadly, all the food (of all 5 guests) was super disappointing, and can't believe this is a Charlie Palmer restaurant.

Just from a glance, the historic wine tower is awe-inspiring to look at. Decor was spacious, classy vibe, although generally lighting could be a tad bit more mood.  Appetizers were on point. Can't really screw up mac n cheese but it was cheesy yet with a nice crisp in certain parts for texture. Mushrooms smoky yet chewy on the inside.  Rib eye was very tender. Only complaint I had was that it was too fatty, and I usually like my rib eyes where they could benefit from some liposuction.  I could kinda surmise why the ratings are on the low side. Food was excellent but I wouldn't go back and pay $54 for that rib eye.   I really wanted to comment on the wine, but it was too free flowing, in a good way, that I could not really keep track of it.  I didn't have any seafood, but others in my party did and said it was excellent. Perhaps I should've went with the surf.",

It is so overpriced for what you are given, and there are restaurants within the hotel to spend your money at. I ordered the Halibut, which my piece of fish was half the size of a small business card. It came in a bowl, on a tiny piece of mashed potato. I ate my entree in 3 bites. It tasted great, but after leaving dinner, had to go elsewhere to actually eat! The \"Wine Angles\" were nothing exiting as was told. They have a glass shelving area, where a girl in strapped in a harness and goes up to get the absurd overpriced bottle of wine you can buy at any store for $10, and comes back down. The worst part of the restaurant, was the bathrooms! The bathroom is a small one toilet room, with the sink OUTSIDE of the bathroom in an open area, where people can walk by in the hallway, and watch you wash your hands and freshen up. It felt like a sink like they have in locker rooms in my old middle school.  There are so many other places to dine - don't waste your time or money. You'll leave here feeling disappointed, hungry, and broke!",

    "text": "I really hate that I can't give this a higher rating as I'm a huge Charlie Palmer fan but I just can't. And it's not that that anything was majorly wrong. It just was meh... which was very disappointing as I had a friend from our of town that I wanted to spoil. It had been years since I had been here and it just didn't meet the experience I had painted I. My mind.  First off, I bragged about the amazing wine tower and wine angels. From what I remembered the angels wore a practical yet kind of sophisticated sleek looking black cat suit as they were reeled up and down that impressive tower. The poor girl was wearing a very unflattering thing that kind was kind of a boring grayish nude color and sneakers. When I'm paying for a fine dining experience I don't want something reminiscent of a gym suit with a sneaker in my face.   Now the fiasco that is the menu... we had already planned on doing the special Restaurant Week menu but being that we are both foodies we still wanted to start with an app to share. The menu was incredibly confusing as it's not broken down into appetizers and entrees. It's all clumped together based on veggies, land or sea so we had no idea what was a realistic shareable item versus an entree. It wasn't until about 20-30 minutes of us staring in confusion on what the heck we are looking at before the server came by to explain it. A menu shouldn't be that confusing that you can't figure out where the appetizers are listed.   We are pretty big into wine and part of the reason we chose this place was for the dynamic wine list. But let's face it, the more options the more overwhelming it can be. So we asked our server for help and we really kind of expected a sommelier to come and ask questions about our palates and what we planned on ordering. That's part of the fun in choosing such a wine centric restaurant. The server was nice enough but just kind of fumbled and seemed to just make a pure random suggestion.  Now that we figured out how to unlock the appetizer mystery, we were super excited to see there was a bacon wrapped pork belly topped with egg. The pork belly itself was amazing however the egg on top should have been sexy and oozing when the yolk was hit. It was way over done. No sexy oozing there which was a big disappointment to what should have been an amazing dish.    For my entree I originally was going to get the seafood risotto but the server awkwardly talked me into the filet instead. I am by no means opposed to a good steak but they are a dime a dozen in this town and I wanted something interesting. I love servers suggestions since they are usually in the know and can guide you into something you may have overlooked. But it's really odd when someone orders something like seafood and is guided to an extreme opposite like a steak. I went with his suggestion even though I was really excited to try the risotto. It was as if there was something he knew that was top secret.  Like maybe people kept sending it back or the fish wasn't fresh. So since I didn't feel like dying I reluctantly went with the filet. The filet was amazing as I would expect no less from Charlie Palmer.  My friend is trying to eat healthier (yes this is the same person that just ordered bacon wrapped pork belly) and ordered the zucchini pasta with vegan cheese for her entree. I'm really kind of shocked that my filet tasting menu was the same price as her vegetarian pasta that I could have made at home with my spiralizer. She said it was good but at $80 per person that should have been fantastic. Saying you used black garlic just doesn't seem like enough to justify a cost like that.  Dessert was interesting. It was a trio of cheesecake representing Brie, cheddar and blue cheese. I'm all about teasing the taste buds by dancing between the sweet and savory but this just didn't seem to work especially on the blue cheese portion. It was just too salty and not enough vibrancy to offset it. Not an exciting way to finish off the meal.  Now the bathroom situation. Really awkward and not classy at all. First they are individual restrooms which is a nice touch at a place that is supposed to be elegant. However, there is no mirror or sink in there and you basically go to a co-ed mirror and wash station. And there was some creepy guy that kept lurking around the corner watching. Maybe this is a sign of the times of no longer having assigned sex bathrooms. But the last thing I want at a fine dining establishment is some creepster checking me out as I'm trying to remove spinach lodged in my teeth.  From my understanding they recently underwent a big remodel and were closed for awhile. That could explain some things going on but don't charge top dollar while you are still in practice.  Better off going to Charlie Palmer's Steak in the adjoining Four Seasons. It doesn't have that beautiful monstrosity of a wine tower but I have been there more than a dozen times and have always had an exceptional experience.",

    "text": "It's not all bad, but buckle up because I'm going to spell it out for you! First of all of they can not accommodate large parties of 12 or more. We had 12 and a baby and crammed into a round table. The wait staff were constantly reaching over us to fill water or bread. Very tacky when trying to eat and constantly having an arm in your face. That was only the beginning of the nightmare.   Let's get to the food I had the seared scallops which were delicious the petite filet mignon which was cooked to perfection accompanied by the blue cheese sauce. My wife had the sea bass which was blissful with every bite. Dessert was one of the most amazing creme brulee I've ever had. Now back to the nightmare which was my 40th birthday celebration. Prior to ordering we asked for seperate checks, we were told no problem. We also informed the waiter we had a wine paring coupon he said that once we ordered someone would help with the pairing. Then the manager came over and said this would not be happening and to just order wine and they would subtract the price of our vouchers. Not what I paid for but ok.   Here is where it gets really bad. Check comes not separated. So we ask for seperate checks again. They are brought out one by one. At this point we've spent 4 hours in this place one and a half of that time was waiting for checks. I'm last to get my check and it is wrong. Then they could not figure out how to take off my pairing which was really not a pairing. So here I am trying to celebrate and these people couldn't figure their stuff out. Then they were claiming someone didn't pay and could we track them down since not everyone wanted to sit at a cramped table any longer. Finally had to write everything down by hand of what we had and they rang us up and checked us out. Worst experience ever.   Oh and the wine fairies they were cool.",

It goes without saying they have a fantastic wine list.   The food they serve is healthy and sourced locally where possible. Their foods are displayed with an amazing attention to detail, and there's usually a method or story behind what they serve. They are big into food chemistry, and how certain flavors inspire the pallet.   Las Vegas is becoming more and more about fine foods and amazing service, and I think Aureole is a great example of where the future of Vegas is heading.",

Calamari was lightly breaded but the actual squid was really greasy, borderline slimy.  That was a first. Short rib ravioli meat tasted gamey, virtually no sauce to balance the flavor.  Service was weak, waiter dropped off our food and never checked back.  I have no issue with food being overpriced since this is Vegas, but they should be embarrassed about this feeble attempt at a nice meal.",

They have your usual specials--beer and wine for $5-$6 for a glass/pint. I know that you can essentially get free alcohol in the casinos, but when you want to enjoy some of the appetizers during happy hour, some alcohol will add to the appeal!  My friend and I ordered the trio of cheese platter which had brillat savarin, goat blue log, and beecher's flagship reserve from Seattle, WA. It was paired with a honey comb, onion jam, and candied walnuts. They, of course, served it with a platter of toast. Delicious!!! I highly recommend this platter!  We also ordered the cilantro hummus with pita chips. I liked it, but cilantro was pretty dominant so if you can't stomach the taste, I wouldn't recommend it. Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgeable and nice. We had two servers--an older gentleman and a younger gentleman--the younger gentleman was our server and was very sociable and answered our questions.   All in all, I enjoyed the happy hour prices and meals that was offered at this place besides the gorgeous wine tower that is on display.",

Unfortunately, our waiter had not tried any of the dishes we were considering and was of little help to us in making choices.  The other staff were far more helpful, and ensured our evening was enjoyable.  The wine list is very extensive but way overpriced.  Look carefully and you can get a few excellent wines that won't kill the bank account (under$100). At first our order came out wrong and was immediately rectified.  The food was good but sparse.  The duck fat fries (we just had to try) were excellent but at $14.00 for a handful of fries way too expensive.  We were comped a free dessert due to mix up earlier and settled on the cheese platter.  Overall it would probably be a 3.5, but gave it a 4 as 3 would have been too harsh.  We enjoyed ourselves and that in the end matter most!",

Upon being seated we wanted something more private and I literally pointed at a table and in 45 seconds it was ready to go!! You definitely get what you pay for!!!!   The food was AMAZING!! amazing ingredients.  Our start was a bottle of Pinot noir from Santa Barbara, with a sweet pea puree/wild mushrooms/duck prosciutto Amazing! next,  the Exec. Chef made a special rack of lamb for me which was absolutely amazing and cooked to perfection med rare!  Our waiter personally brought me into the kitchen and let me thank him personally!

    "text": "Cant help but give this place 5 stars on a meal I didnt pay for...  I ordered the french onion soup, filet mignon with bleu cheese, and an apple turnover for dessert.  The FOS was unlike any I have ever had - it started out like a souffle, except with a crunchy/cheesy dome around the top. A couple of pushes with the spoon into the delicious foie gras and truffle infused soup and the dish actually seems more like my everyday French Onion Soup, except there were lots of little crunchy pieces of the caved in dome. I finished the last bits of soup off with two of the 5 breads that are offered by the breadboy (I went pretzel bread and cheddar/walnut). Delicious, my coworkers got the romaine lettuce which looked totally underwhelming, but I guess thats what being healthy is all about.  The Filet was cooked perfectly medium rare, witha  nice and pink center and a good char to the outside. The bleu cheese was very creamy, with just the right amount of delicious chunks to give every bite a kick. I dont know if it was the knife that was so sharp, or the meat was so tender, but it was easier to cut through the steak than it was to cut the butter knife through butter at the table. Each bite was so juicy and delicious...I'm pretty sure this was the better steak of my excursion (beating out the KC Strip I had in Kansas City).  The desert was an apple turnover with maple iced cream, apple slaw and caramel spirals. SO GOOD! There were 3 small crispy rings of apple goodness which I topped with the apple slaw (basically stringline pieces of apple). The maple ice cream was a great compliment along with the caramel spirals (I crushed these down in order to get little flakes in each bite).  The bill for 6 people was about $550 including gratuity which doesnt seem unreasonable, considering the meal also included drinks.  It was also nice noting that this place isnt nearly as loud as many of the other Vegas restaurants I have been to. It's nice being able to converse with people across the table without repeating every sentence.  I'd probably give this place 4 stars if I had paid, but thats because I'm a cheap jew and usually prefer holes in the wall.",

The focus of the restaurant is the wine tower which spans from the entry level down to the restaurant level.  I had the tasting menu consisting of four courses for $110.  Frankly, I really don't remember what I ate.  Each plate was very well decorated with small portion.  The rack of lamb came in four or five slices of precut meat.  Some of the dishes were so well decorated that you can't tell what is the food you're eating.  The other reason is that lighting was too dark.  I like the French Onion soup the most.  You've to order it on the side.  It was not salty and was really tasty. The foods were not bad, and service was good, but I probably won't come back again.",

    "text": "Quite possibly one of the best restaurants in the US.  This was easily one of the best dining experiences of my life.  We sat down and received an overview of the extensive wine list (handily kept on an ipad) and were presented with the four story wine cellar managed by \"wine angels\" who fly up and down to retrieve your selected bottle(s).  It's stunning.  First, don't listen to folks who \"dropped in\" and sat at the bar.  This place deserves the respect of making a reservation and sitting down for the experience.  Get the tasting menu.  It was $85 per person, and had four double courses, each playing off their own theme.  For instance, course one was \"foie gras\" and had a hot and cold prep.  Very non-traditional preps as well, not just seared and terrine.    Let me back up though... our REAL first course was the foie gras chicken and waffles.  Are you kidding me?  I prefer not to swear in reviews, but WOW, this was f-ing amazing.  Perfectly seared foie over crispy chicken skin, a waffle, and dark meat bits of succulent chicken.  I could have just ordered three more portions of this with a bottle of sauternes and been happy as hell.  Anyway, after the chicken and waffles came the first foie course, which was amazing.  The second course was a play on squash, the third was a play on \"cheek\".  On one side, we hade grade A5 kobe beef cheeks with some tenderloin and on the other side we had cod cheeks.  Remarkable.  The final course was a play on peaches.  A perfect ending.    Wine pairing was $55 in addition to the $85 tasting fee.  You will not leave hungry, and the wines were truly paired very well.  I've been to Vegas over 50 times and always wanted to eat here.  Now it will be on my list each time I go.",

When we do Vegas, we always try and go big meaning we do the fancy expensive restaurants that we normally wouldn't ever do at home. Well I am here to say Aureole did not let us down nor did it disappoint.   Everything was first class and top notch from the service to the food and the atmosphere. It was pricey but well worth every penny. The wine cellar and wine angels made our dinner even more entertaining. This is a great place to take a date, girlfriend, or wife especially if you're looking to impress them. Just make sure you like the girl if it's a date, and that you love your girlfriend or wife cause remember it's expensive however, it's pretty much a guaranteed panty dropper  =D",

This time we sat in the main dining room which offers a stunning view of the wine tower. We saw a couple angels fetch bottles. But otherwise, I much prefer the intimacy and extra level of service experienced in swan court.  We all ordered wine by the glass, the husband and I ordered of the menu and BIL chose the market menu.  Combined we started with clam chowder, onion soup and the pear tart with duck proscuitto. While nothing was outstanding, all three whet our appetite and we were ready for more.  Then for the main course we had Waygu skirt steak, the rack of lamb and the scallops. The steak had fantastic flavor, but it was very chewy, likely due to the cut of meat. As good as the flavor was I couldn't help but think it was like beef flavored bubble gum -- tasty while you chew, but you don't want to swallow it. The scallops were huge and nicely prepared, but the vanilla apple compote was simply too sweet for my liking and I thought it completely overwhelmed the dish. The star of the meal was the lamb. Rich and meaty, just plain delicious. I also ordered ratatouille for us to share. It was very good.   The dinner was good, but it should have been better. We left pretty disappointed.",

Aureole is home to the Wine Fairy's where their servers hook up into this giant Wine Tube and \"fly\" up and down when you select a wine from their automated IPad based wine list with accurate recommendations and no overbearing pretentiousness. They offer a very good Prix Fix menu and we actually were dining when Chef Charlie Palmer was in attendance. He took a picture with us and had a menu signed by his Executive Chef which we've added to our robust collection. I would recommend eating here and can't wait to go back.",

I'm a wine dork.  Service was helpful, if a little pretentious...   they did get us out in time to catch our show, though, which was appreciated.  The sommelier we had (a vivacious blonde woman) seemed to enjoy her job and was helpful ... not snotty at all.    I liked her.  They have a three course and a seven course menu.  We had the three course with a Champagne cocktail to start (I had the Champagne Negroni) which were quite good, even if they were totally overpriced at $21 a glass.    Unfortunately, the food was not up to par.     I had the Scallop Trio appetizer.  The scallop wonton was good but nothing special,  the truffle encrusted scallop was not at all encrusted... just a seared scallop sitting in a mysterious bland sauce... I tasted no truffle at all.   Finally, the ceviche spring roll was covered in some sort of creamy green sauce that didn't taste like much of anything.  Not spicy, not sweet, not savory.. just kind of nothingness.  Disappointing.   I would have liked the two hot items to have actually been hot, as well.  Meh.  My friends Black Mission Fig and Roquefort Tart w/Serrano Ham was good.  I love that kind of combination of sweet, salty and rich.   However, I felt like it too could have been warmer.     For my main, I had the Organic Roast Chicken with Fricassee of Fingerling Potato and Pearl Onion, Truffle Infused Jus...    Sounds great huh..?  But no, not so much.  Just your average roast chicken...  I've had better elsewhere and again, I didn't taste any truffle.   Portion size was quite large and I ended up leaving more than half.   I guess some folks would appreciate that but I hate wasting food so it just made me sad.  My friend had the Surf and Turf (braised beef short rib, butter poached Maine lobster, spinach mousseline) and while the short rib was rich, delicious and fall apart tender, she was disappointed by the beefy sauce that covered entire dish, including the lobster and hence, the lobster flavor.   Her husbands Kobe beef special was also just okay, IMO.  I've had far better Kobe at Sent Sovi in Saratoga and the foie at Picasso was superior as well.  Not worth the extra price tag, IMO.  Dessert was the cheese plate for me, which was good but featured nothing that I hadn't had before.  Some hard to find artisan cheeses would be nice.   My armagnac was great though.  A first for me, and now I'm corrupted forever.   My friends lemon verbena creme brulee was very good.  Light in flavor and texture with a thin crust.  Really nice.    Overall I would go back for the entertainment value of the wine list but only if someone else was paying.  There's simply just better food to be had elsewhere in Vegas.  Sad to say.",

Each one had a thick, juicy beef patty on a sesame seed bun along with crispy bacon and a guacamole chipotle sauce to add a kick. These are some of the best sliders this side of the slider truck.  * I'm a sucker for anything with lobster, so I had to try their lobster corn dogs. Big mistake. These dogs were a big letdown. They're basically three small, round fritters filled with a mixture that hardly tasted of lobster. I couldn't really pinpoint what was in the mixture, just a mushy bland mess.  * The shrimp scampi had some tomatoes and greens in it and was pretty bland. Not enough garlic.  I'll be back, but only for the oysters and sliders.",

My aunt had the seared sea scallop a bit salty for my taste, but I never use salt in my cooking so I cant really judge. My mom had the cod which was delicious!

I also had the kale with caramelized onions and bacon - amazing. Really this was one of the best side dishes I've ever had. It was big enough to fill me and tasty enough to finish the entire plate. The finale of this meal was absolutely divine. The chocolate trio. Go there right now and order this. First there is a small cup of chocolate fondue accompanied with fresh strawberries and warm hazelnut doughnuts. Deadly. They're just beyond phenomenal. Then there are chocolate profiteroles in the center surrounded by homemade toasted marshmallows and sitting on a fudge sauce. Heavenly. The third item, to round out the trio, is a chocolate ganache topped with caramel corn. I nearly died - it was just fantastic.   Service - Okay so I ate at the bar. Service was not the best - he forgot my first glass of wine so I got it after the reminder but then he never brought the second. The bartender also made me move my seat to accommodate another guest who never ended up arriving. So - very poor service overall. However, the bad service is worth the food :)",

    "text": "Ok, I know in my previous review I just said one should never go to a fine dining restaurant in Vegas and bitch about the price, that you should know better.  But, in the case of Aureole...I wish we had known better.  This restaurant is beautiful.  We were seated at a table with our own private outdoor area.  Our table was inside, and we had french doors that opened up to our private patio with another table that was right next to a pool that had swans swimming back and forth.  It was so romantic and beautiful.  We went outside once or twice to smoke a cigarette (since the dinner experience was 3 hours long) and to have dessert out there.  The swans swimming 2 feet next to us was a nice touch...although they didn't seem people-friendly.  It was a dining experience I'll never forget...sitting out there in the warm desert night with swans surrounding us.  The thing I didn't really like about Aureole was that we had to choose from either a $120 pre fix menu or a more expensive pre fix menu option (I think it was $200 but I cant remember).  So, with wine and tip we ended up paying more than expected.  I would have appreciated if we were allowed to choose our items a la cart, instead of being forced to have a tasting menu.  The food was a solid 3.  It was good, but not memorable.    One really cool thing was the touch screen computer/tablet they gave us as their wine list.  It was an actual laptop.  Pretty high tech.  Be prepared to drop BANK here, but you wont have a bad experience.  Just an expensive one.",

Our waiter never introduced his name nor came back in a timely manner to see if we would like to start on any appetizers before our main entree. By the time our waiter ,by, the name of Abdaljalil ( asked for his name from another server walking by) came by to take my drink order.. i was ready to order my whole meal for the evening.   I ordered a glass of wine to enjoy with my sirloin sliders with guacamole and chipotle sauce and a plate of artisaal cheese and house accompaniments, sliders were perfectly cooked and prepared.   For the main entree I ordered 2 bone in rib eye with the garlic firecracker and classic bearnaise sauce accompany with some Parmesan fries and buttered asparagus.   When ordering our main entree, I asked our waiter Abdaljalil if he could slice the rib eye in pieces for us, he responded No. So i left it as that.   As our servers Dario and Ricardo were extremely tentative with refilling our water and constantly asking us what was needed, they even offered if i would like the bone in rib eye sliced in the back to make it easier for sharing. First, I already asked our waiter prior to ordering, so i was a bit confused with they offered to take it back to the kitchen. Our waiter Abdaljalil pulled Dario and Ricardo behind our booth and was saying something for quite a while, somehow Dario and Ricardo made my request happen!   Our bone in rib eye was cooked to perfection, our sides was good but nothing to rave about.   In all honesty, i was disappointed with our Waiter.If we didn't have good servers like Dario and Ricardo, i would have rated this a 1.   The waiter did not even bring us our check,our servers did!!!!!!!   I have dine at the Charlie Palmer in Orange County a lot, and that restaurant has never let me down. I was expecting the same type of service when dining at Aureole.   I would probably attempt to dine at Aureole again and request for a different waiter, and hopefully get the same servers and better experience.Hopefully i can revised this review when i revisit the restaurant for a second chance.",

I kind of dug the pc wine tablet, but the battery died on our first one and wiped out our selections (making our NY sales rep rather cranky).  They quickly brought us another, but with all the options, we couldn't remember what we'd originally ordered.  The sommelier was quick to help us make new choices, and we were off!  Amuse Bouche:  Sunchoke Soup - Delicious, but I thought it was kind of odd that they would bring a non veggie item for everyone to taste without announcing the vast amounts of bacon in it...  what if one of us had been a vegetarian??  My Choices:  To Start  - French onion soup with foie gras and truffles AND puff pastry top....  ummm...  yummy!!!  Verrrrrry rich.  Honestly, I could have stopped there.  Main - Roasted rack of lamb (med/rare...leaning more towards rare) with nicoise olives, preserved tomato and braised flageolet beans... very happy with my dinner.  I love it when a dish comes to the table perfectly seasoned!  J:  To Start  - Scallop trio which consisted of a truffle encrusted scallop, a scallop wonton, and scallop ceviche.  He snarfed it all down in record time (unlike his wine...which I was all too happy to help him with...  LIGHTWEIGHT)!  Main - Surf and Turf:  Braised short ribs and butter poached lobster.  He ate all of the ribs and lobster, but there was a little dish of some sort of seafood mousse that he did not enjoy at all.  Sales rep:  To Start - Ahi Tuna Duo:  He said it was delicious.  There was tuna tartare over Comice pear chutney, and seared tuna with ginger and cilantro.  Main - Surf and Turf:  same result as J.  The rep insisted on ordering a dessert while J continued to struggle with the 3 large glasses of wine he had accumulated...  Lydia to the rescue!!!  Unfortunately, this led to me being just drunk enough to let our equally inebriated sales rep spoon feed me some of the chocolate souffle.  Hmmmm...  only slightly humiliating!  Oops!  All in all, I enjoyed my meal, and the service was excellent.",

    "text": "This is a long-overdue review from our Thanksgiving Vega$ weekend. Our decision to go was based on three factors:  1. Always wanted to try a Charlie Palmer restaurant, why not here? 2. Had to see the famous wine tower.  One of the seven wonders of the world, you know. 3. Had to pick a fancy restaurant that fellow Yelper, Cynthia C. hadn't yet dined at in Vegas (not an easy task, as that girl's done some professional-level eating in this city).  Set a date Set a time Starve yourself.  The Mandalay Bay Resort never fails to amuse me.  It's like a benign tumor that just keeps growing and growing.  I hadn't seen it in awhile, but the sheer size of the facility is impressive, even by Vegas standards.  Aureole is nestled in their restaurant row amongst some fairly ornate facades.    **Aside, walk by Rum Jungle or Red Square and you'll never never be the same again...**  In stark contrast, the entrance to Aureole seems almost spartan in comparison.  The view changes dramatically once you're inside and staring at the four-story steel and glass phallus they call the wine tower.  It's a pretty impressive beast, and definitely the center of attention. The main dining room softens a bit as you're surrounded in rich, dark hardwoods, white tablecloths, and leather chairs.  This is probably a deliberate attempt to distract diners from that large tumescent mamma-hamma wine tower...  Our table went with the special Riedel Anniversary tasting menu that night.  Wifey and I had to forgo the vino due to alien/parasite problems... but that's another story.  The food, however, was spectacular.  Highlights of our evening included a hunk o' otoro tuna that was otherworldly, and just about the best bison we've ever sunk our teeth into.  The flavors were almost enough to distract me from that monstrously engorged wine tower of verticality.  Conversation at the table was lively and electric.  The ladies looked terrific, but my mind was obviously elsewhere.  Wifey: \"It was so sweet of Aureole to make a substitution for one of my dishes, don' t u think, sweetie?\" Me: \"Damn, did u see the size of that tower?!?  That's one hella tower!\"  Wifey: \"Don't u think Cynthia C's dress is really cute?\" Me: \"Yeah.  How many bottles do u think they can fit in that tower?  Shazam!  That thing's huge!!!  In the end, we had a great time, with delicious food and wonderful company.  My only regret of the evening was not being able to witness  the lovely wine angels glide up and down the shaft of that tower...  You have a dirty mind.",

Wine angel/tower overrated, looked better on Travel Channel, too dark to see her in her designer angel duds. Computer was down so we only got paper wine menu.  Service was just OK. Waiter poured Pelligrino into my ice water glass.  Bread- I've had better on the M, or Wynn buffet.  Maybe this building is just cursed, I haven't had a good 4 or 5 star meal in the Mandalay at any of the restaurants.",

I don't know if he thought he was being funny or we just looked young and he thought he get away with it.  I go to Vegas once a year to have a little fun and have  wonderful fine dining experiences.

    "text": "We got a $75 dining credit upon check in and decided we wanted to use it somewhere swanky, this place was swanky enough plus they had an awesome wine tower with wine angels and I wanted to watch the angels fly up the tower so this is where we ended up. First the hostesses were very friendly. They greet you immediately and aren't distracted. Our waiter was very nice and made us laugh throughout the night. You get an iPad at your table to make it easier for you to browse through the drink offerings. I selected a moscato di Asti and it was great. We were headed to watch MJ One so took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu. WOW. Every dish here is just an explosion of flavor. We started off with arugula, burratta, crostini and ham, it also had tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and pesto, the combination sounded strange but the flavors went well together. Next was the prime hanger steak and rock shrimp scampi. With the word scampi I am naive and expected noodles, no noodles here this was the most amazing dish ever. The steak was so tender and exploded with flavor on every bite. The shrimp was amazing. It all sat upon this corn succotash which I am determined to learn to make it was that good! Just when I thought it couldn't get any better they bring out dessert. A German Chocolate lava cake. That was heavenly. It was a lava cake with coconut ice cream. It was one of those dishes  that is so good it transports you to another place and just makes you want to smile. With dessert they serve an espresso infused vodka and brandy cocktail. It was like tiramisu in a glass. 3 courses plus a cocktail all for $58 In Vegas to me is a bargain and I didn't mind paying that much for a meal because it was the best meal I have ever had. The other thing is they don't overfill your plate so you don't leave feeling uncomfortable, just satisfied. Great food, great service, reasonable prices earns them 5 stars.",

I wasn't impressed by the food nor the service, which at this price point is important to me.  (Even tho I wasn't paying ;) We were seated right away, and the waiter did not clearly explain our dining options, leaving all of us confused.  We finally figured it out, and we all went with the $75 prix fix with a $15 upgrade for \"Today's Special\", an organic Australian filet mignon with foie gras, black truffle shavings, and morel mushrooms.  Well I should have known better, this \"special\" sounded like someone was trying too hard with fancy ingredients, and left me disappointed. The timing of our courses felt rushed, being asked several times if we were finished.  The courses were served without explanation, other than \"this is really good, better than Kobe beef.\"  Hm, another warning sign. For desert I chose the assorted sorbets, which was served as 6 golf ball sized sorbets in a tray.  Nothing special here, someone missed the quality not quantity class. Aureole is all show, so don't go.  Walk in and check out the impressive wine tower, walk back out and go somewhere else for dinner.",

For our entree we both had the NY strip. It was HUGE and the sauce on it was good. We had a side of mashed potatoes which were good as well. Overall the food was quite good.

We were barely seated before he decended and raced through the wine options without so much as a warm smile, introduction, welcome, or caring about the fact that my wife had been seated on the gap between two bench seats. Cutting to the end of the service, as he presented the bill he finally decided to smile and converse with us. Too late, buddy. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we decided to order multiple appetizers rather than one main course each in order to sample as much of the fair as possible...who knows.  The food was ok but not stellar. The foie gras was excellent but that's the only thing that I even remember from the meal. In fact, now that I'm writing this, I really can't recall what we ate, it was that unforgettable.  Of course, it could have been an off-day. But hey - restaurants that charge this kind of money should never have an off=day.  The wine tower was a novelty but I'm here for the food.  This restaurant will be easy to walk past in future.",

(It is Vegas, however, and everything is expensive, so...).   The restaurant entrance and lobby are quite nice - the wine tower makes for an eye-catching centerpiece to the main dining room.  Service has been attentive, though a bit slow paced.  We had no difficulty getting the attention of our server when I've dined here.  I suspect some people may interpret a leisurely pace as \"poor service.\"  Each time I've dined here, my server frequently came through to fill water and wine glasses, see if anything was needed, and to ensure we were enjoying our dinners.  I also found them to be very accommodating, for example, making some substitutions even though I had ordered from a prix fixe menu.   All in all, I have had good experiences here.",

Everybody must see these \"wine angels\" retrieve wine (they sway around and up/down on a spelunking cord!).  This is a good place to go to when you're in Vegas just to say you did something fancy.  My bf and I were in town for his b-day.  There is a PC tablet that you order wine bottles from, which I thought was unnecessary to go electronic versus a paper menu, but it does make sorting wine by type and price, fast.  Just for fun, we wanted to see what the highest priced wine bottle was, and I believe it was in the $thousands!  The service was great; perhaps a little too overbearing, as the waiter was constantly checking up on us every 5 minutes, it felt like.  My bf and I ordered from the $75 3-course prix-fixe menu (I believe there is a $95 7-course menu too), and the water gave us an extra dessert with a candle for his b-day.  Food portions were average.  My main entree was the salmon, and my bf's was one of the steaks, and his steak totally trumped my salmon.  It has an overall romantic and classy atmosphere.  You will feel underdressed in anything less than a skirt or slacks.",

First, because I frequent the Charlie Palmer in Orange County, and wanted to see what else Mr.Palmer had up his sleeve. Second, because the offerings looked beyond enticing. I went with my date, and being the foodie that I am, he let me pick what we were going to eat. To start the dinner off we had their complimentary artisan breads, my personal favorite being the bacon bread (yummm!!!). I decided that the first courses looked more exciting than the seconds, and as we usually do, just ordered 4 things to share: Onion soup, Lobster Cappuccino, Wild Mushroom Risotto, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. The first course of soups was perfect. The lobster cappuccino was the front runner (I literally wanted to lick the bowl clean), and the onion soup was good but couldn't compete with the lobster. The wait for our second course was kind of long, which our waiter apologized for- and comped us dessert and espresso's, but after our first bite of both dishes neither of us cared about the wait. Both dishes were magic! The complexity of the flavors was astounding. I think my date and I looked at eachother with disbelief several times. Sadly, even though we shard everything, we couldn't finish it all (which I felt really bad about considering how deelish it all was). The espresso and gelato were great as well, but the two second course dishes will sit in my memory until my next foodgasm :)",

    "text": "I had a pretty bad/weird experience at Auerole. I am not sure if it was the fact that we looked young but the service was horrible.   Food: Food was ok nothing special. The menu itself did not have adequate description on what was really in the dish so it was up to our waiter to tell us.   Price: It was over priced for the food we actually got. I have had much better food and I personally feel I could probably cook better than what I actually got. The sauteed clams I got as an appetizer was actually pretty good.   Service: So this is my biggest annoyance about the place. I mean am I not paying the same as the person as the next person.   1) I get the menu and couldn't decide between the Salmon and Ranch Raised Chicken. The server comes to me and I ask what he would suggest? his response \"everything on the menu is fresh and everything is good. The chicken is a ranch raised chicken.\" Really is that why on the menu it said RANCH RAISED and I would hope everything is fresh at the prices I am paying but that was not my question now was it? That is all he said so I just said well i guess I will go with the chicken. Still keeping a positive attitude.   2) The food comes (not sure the name of this server but it was the bald guy) He did not say one word at all he threw the plate down in front of me and my husband. Grabbed my husbands empty beer bottle and was about to walk away. I said umm did you want another one to my husband? Still not saying a word he looked at my husband. So my husband says yes i will have another.. Ok at this point you would think he would actually SPEAK to us. Nope instead of asking me if I wanted anything he POINTED at me.. What the hell? WHy the hell do I want a persons finger in my face?! I said NO Thanks and laughed in his face because of his rudeness. As soon as he walked away my husband said what the HELL was that? who points at a person and is this person MUTE?   3) You would think at some point someone would come fill my empty water glass because the person at the next table had their water filled and it was still half full. Nope my husband actually had to flag them down to get more water. Yes we had to flag them down because they did not bother to come over and at least ask how our meal was.   4) As stated above they did not come over to even ask how I meal was. We finished our meal the waiter comes over and just says \"I see you are done with your meal want any dessert\" I ask for the dessert menu but honestly at that point I just wanted to get the hell out of there.   We still gave them at 20% tip because we always give at least 20%. Hey imagine what they would've got if they were actually nice to us?   I am not sure if the reason they treated us different than the others was because we LOOKED young. Yes I said LOOKED because we are NOT young we are both just very lucky to still get carded. Or was it the fact that I was not drinking. Sorry i am not allowed to drink but you would think they would still treat you the same? I asked for a virgin pina colada but they do not make frozen drinks the only nonalcoholic drink they could offer me was OJ mixed with Pineapple juice.. NO thanks!",

A waiter also walks around with a bread basket with like 5 different kinds of breads for you to choose from. The appetizers had the best presentation I think.

Of course, our food was great, delicious and beautifully plated as one would expect, but what really made this meal was the exceptional service we received from everyone we encountered.  I drink my fair share of good wine, but I'll admit to being a little intimidated by the concept of \"sommelier.\" I got over this quickly after meeting Adam, our sommelier for the evening.  His friendliness, affability, and unpretentiousness really added to our enjoyment of the evening.  It didn't hurt that he was pouring exceptionally good wines by the glass, and kept us tasting wines that we never would have ordered on our own and really ended up enjoying.  Even if you don't order a bottle, make sure to check out the extensive wine list, presented on a tablet PC and sortable by varietal, region, vintage, etc.  Very cool.  I started with a Caesar salad and my wife with a baby fields greens salad.  Both were excellent, although I'd have to say that mine was a bit prettier.  I ordered a loup de mer and my wife had a dish featuring smoked sturgeon and scallops.  I'd say she was the winner of the entree contest, with mine being slightly overcooked.  I was happy nonetheless, as the accompanying flavors and the terrific wine more than balanced any deficiencies in the dish's preparation.  We finished with a dynamite warm lava mocha cake and some small complementary truffles.  And of course a nice ice wine for our liquid desert.  Bernard, the dining room manager, has brought his years of experience at Spago to Aureole, and it shows.  Nice work, everyone!  Thanks for a terrific evening.",

It is a little complicated, they seem to take your name up in the entry way, but then you walk down to the maitre d' and they ask you again the same questions and if you have reservations...we said no, but I guess checking in at the front door counted at having reservations? We were confused...Then they mentioned something about seating on some side area, outdoors or what...we thought they meant this b/c my hubby was under dressed, that that's the only place they would seat us? After much confusion, we figured out that we can sit 'anywhere' we like, and eat a la carte (they had prix fixed which they seemed to push a lot, but my hubby and I eat different things so the prix fix didnt cover both our 'tastes').   So, after the confusing entry, we finally decided to be seated in the lounge area by the bar, right next to the glass tower where the wines are stored..It was very comfy sitting there, felt private too (dining room area was getting fuller as the night went on).   The food was great! I was worried about portion sizes being too small, but it was more than enough. I had halibut, and got a really big piece of it! Double of what I was expecting. My husband had some red meat (steak) he said it was good. The side dish of risotto would've been wonderful except it was VERY al dente...I mean crunchy still..so that was a bit disappointing...We also tried some cheeses for appetizers, they were amazing! We both loved those, had some huckleberries on the plate too! As for wine, we ordered a bottle of Derbes Pinot Noir ($90 or so, later we found out they 'only' double the price, not tripled like we thought they probably did). But I have to say, when you are at this place, you just have to buy a whole bottle :)   Dessert...was amazing! My hubby had 'cocoa infused creme brulee', which tasted superb! I had some dark chocolate dessert with 'pistachio olive oil' ice cream and was heaven! On the side they also brought us some small dessert treats, so that was real nice too.   Overall, great place to try at least once...I would definitely go there for the cheese, wine and dessert... :)",

    "text": "We had a really nice experience on Monday night.  First of all, we told them that it was our anniversary so they sat us in the back room which is more private.  We were sat in a booth looking out the back of the restaurant at two swans and a beautifully lit little pond.  Our server was super nice.  We were first offered the price fixe menus which are a bit pricey, but when I asked for the a la carte menu and small plates menus, it was gladly accepted.  We ordered four different items.  The first dish was a smoked salmon dish which I thought was ok, but a bit tangy/spicy.  The next dish was buttered asparagus.  Although it was simply prepared, the asparagus was delish.  There were about 20 sticks of asparagus.  Yum...  The next dish was a ravioli dish with peas and crab I think.  It was a nice dish with lots of butter also.  The best dish was the black cod.  It was so tender.  I just wish that the piece was a bit bigger.  It was only about 3 inches long and an inch high.    We were offered four different types of bread.  Sourdough, pretzel, focaccio and wheat?    We had two nice glasses of wine, a reisling and a tempranillo.  The total was $138 with tip.  We didn't finish all of the food or wine but walked away very satisfied.",

    "text": "My husband and I loved this restaurant.  I have to say it was our favorite of the fine dining establishments that we ate at during our recent Vegas trip.  The husband got the tasting menu and I tried everything he had.  Every bite was pure heaven.  I had the cod dish and it too was perfect in every way.  My only complaint is that there were several large parties there that night and it was loud and a little chaotic.  The waiter sensed my frustration and asked if they were being too loud.  I said \"no\" because I did not want to spoil their fun and I honestly don't think it was the fault of the party but the way the restaurant is set up.  This was my second time dining at this establishment and the service was much better the first time.  I attribute this largely to the fact that they had two large parties and may have been a little understaffed.  The specialty cocktails here are simply amazing and the desserts are so good that I would have been satisfied making a meal of dessert.  We will dine here every time we are in Vegas.  Check out the wine angels too - it was a Tuesday evening when we were here so we did not see any while we were dining but on busier nights, you will be able to see them scale the extreme wine tower retrieving bottles of wine.",

At first, they said that it wasn't available due to a special Easter menu, but after a brief chat they happily complied. In return, we were compensated with 2 complimentary starters. And then the fun started. The beet and panna cotta starter were to die for, absolutely amazing. Then came the fantastic white asparagus, paired with an asparagus pastry-type and a juicy scallop. The main course was an excellent housemade sausage. But the stunner was the dessert. Lyche sorbert with ginger, yum. Then the waiters arrived with an array of delicious complimentary desserts, from cantaloupe sorbert to creme brulee. We've tried some great tasting menus back home in San Francisco and in Paris, and Aureole is definitely up there. Great time!",

    "text": "I may well be the one of the only people who did not like this place.. Maybe because my expectations were so high...  But I went to Aureole in the Mandalay Bay in Vegas last Thursday evening and the service was horrible..  And food extremely disappointing..   Maybe it was an off night or something, but neither the food nor the service redeemed itself by the end of the night..   The Amuse was not so amusing..  Some cauliflower soup thing that had no wow factor whatsoever..  We both had the foie gras appetizer which had way too much going on and the flavors just did not do it for me..  I mean foie gras is foie gras..  I love it in any preparation, but c'mon now..   Then I had the Escolar, which is a fish that a adore!  Every time I have had it, it was so yummy and buttery and this time it was grilled, but completely overcooked and so dry and unseasoned it seemed..  I only had a couple bites and could not even bring myself to eat any more..  Yes, it was that bad..  MM had the Salmon and he let me try a bite of that and I thought 'Eh...'  I make better salmon than that...  And what's the deal with that ridiculous electronic wine tablet!?!   I mean, what are they paying the Sommelier for?  We tried several times to have them get rid of it and they finally got it out of our way after saying so at least 3x...  So needless to say, the servers were extremely inattentive.. For dessert we shared the Artisan Cheese plate and there 7 or 8 different cheeses and they plopped it down in front of us with no explanation of what they were..  We tried to get someone's attention..  Anyone.  Nothin.. So we decided to just have a go at it and I tried to guess myself what cheese was what..  It was ridiculous.. Finally after a long while, we flagged someone down and  they were like..  'Your server did not explain your cheeses?'   'Uh, no, not at all...  Hello, a little attention here, please!..' To top it off that person, was rude as well..  Not to mention the fact that the servers were too busy cleaning up and putting chairs and tables away, that we felt like 'the door couldn't have hit us faster in the ass on the way out' to boot.. Luckily the company was great, because the experience at Aureole was a complete disappointment..",

We were so impressed we ended up going there three nights in a row. The prices were very  reasonable there was an unending list of wines and drinks. Dave,Dave and Sal were great. We got to know them and they were very knowledgable about all the foods and drinks. It was great to sit down and visit with such nice people. We also liked the fact that not only was the happy hour for food but drinks also and there was a great variety to choose from. Dave showed us around the dining room and they have a beautiful dining area with a pond outside full of swans and chairs to sit and relax in. We can't wait to go back and visit the aureole again. I hope it doesn't get to popular but I am sure it will because it provides such a great experience! Hope to see you soon Dave,Sal,and Dave.  Mark and Sharon",

    "text": "I've walked by Aureole many times, but had heard wide varying experiences from fellow diners about them.  I remember thinking their wine tower sure is impressive looking and that's probably why I've never been tempted to try them.  Similar to my experiences of a hotel that has an opulent impressive lobby, but outdated and junky rooms, I have imparted this feeling of caution to restaurants like Aureole.  Nevertheless a group Vegas trip to celebrate multiple bdays was enough for me to just go along with the flow.  Unfortunately, this time my prior hesitations were confirmed.  It's a good thing I was with good company, bc otherwise the dinner would have been without merit.  Completely not worth it and I whole heartedly recommend you stay away from here.  I always start good things first, but this is gonna be very short.  It's clean and quiet environment.  If you think Vegas is just way too loud and you look for respite from the ding ding ding's of slot machines, you won't notice it here.  They have a nice area at the back of the restaurant with a window overlooking a fountain in a small lake, which I would suggest you request to be seated in if you are dining here.  They have a few private rooms available, but be forewarned that the prix fixe meals you order from are the same menus you can order in the main dining room, just $30 more per person.  (What?!)    It's a total disappointment.  Even though the wine tower does make a dramatic introduction the poorly lit staircase which spirals down around it destroys it.  There's a very slow elevator, but I decided to walk down this monument to Aureole's \"greatness\" in order to experience the full effect.  As I arrived at the bottom, I thought, \"meh.\"  The ambiance here can be nice or boring depending on your situation.  An intimate dinner for two to revel in each others' eyes and hold hands, you'll probably enjoy it.  To me it was boring.  Quiet, stuffy, and unless you're seated at the rear of the restaurant (which has a nice window looking out to a fountain/lake) it's a total drag.  Even though there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant, our large party was seated right at the foot of the wine tower in the front of the restaurant.  It was very distracting to hear the loud descending footsteps of later arriving diners during our meal.  People in our party ordered a couple bottles of wine, but because we were seated at the bottom of the wine tower, we never got to see them retrieve it.  I'm not certain that they even did have to retrieve the bottles from the wine tower.  Similar to dining at an over-rated on the beach restaurant way after the sun has set and darkness envelopes you, I felt we missed the best part for putting up with inflated prices and mediocre food.  Restrooms are ridiculous.  An \"open concept\" gone extremely wrong.  there is no door to the powder room on the woman's side or the men's side, both which have a communal circular trough with only one water dispenser to wash your hands as well as a mirror.  So ladies, don't expect any privacy or space if you're going to touch yourself up.  There is also only one toilet room on each side too (which fortunately does have a door), but everyone else has to wait outside the powder areas and watch each side wash their hands.  It's truly an idiotic design. Service was also abysmal considering this is supposedly a top notch restaurant in Vegas. From start to finish, things took a a long time and with none of the polish of a top restaurant.  Drinks took forever to get to our table, food arrived without a known destination and a diner-like question from the server of \"fish?\", and the fastest most efficient service was in delivery and collecting the check.  I hate restaurants are incompetent until they want you to pay up and get the hell out.  Food was also sadly poor.  Although there were several prix fixe meals to choose from, only the most expensive sounded appetizing.  And since things were on such an impressive start, I decided to save myself some money and order their cheapest and least appealing prix fixe meal.  I won't go into detail in what I had since they rotate the menu frequently and others more than likely won't be able to order anything I had, but everything was just ho-hum.  Is it my fault I was disappointed with my meal?  Maybe, but I feel I wasn't missing out on anything based on the reactions of my fellow diners who had ordered more extravagantly and had saved myself some money to lose at the tables.  = )  Finally the worst part of the meal was dessert.  Multiple bdays meant multiple free desserts which at first seemed delightful since they came out with a large assortment of sorbets, cakes, and other items.  But not one of them was tasty.  In fact several of the fruit sorbets were horrible and I couldn't stand more than a small spoonful.  Way to close the meal out on a low note Aureole!  I took the slow elevator ride up and got the hell out of there!  Do I need to say it?  Go somewhere else!",

We only saw a wine angel go up once and I honestly expected more flips and stunts.  We were in Vegas, afterall!  I know, wrong show.    Not so good (nothing was \"bad):  We went during Restaurant Week and asked concierge to call for a reservation.  Why our reservation was for 9:45, I will never know.  The restaurant was barely 1/2 full when we arrived.  We were presented with only the Restaurant Week menu and we had to mention the wine paring option.  Loved the way the server told us that he would honor it because we knew about it.  First he denied it and then he would honor it.  Whatever!  The food was good but a bit too much going on.  I had the braised octopus and lobster salad.  There were fingerling potatoes, a toasted piece of bread, eggplant, hearts of palm, the octopus, lobster, and some greens on this thing.  Pick it apart and it was excellent.  Everything tasted great.  Put it all together and you have a huge bite going on but it was too much!   Same thing with the entree.  I had the short rib with ahi tuna.  There was a gnochhi pieces (very good!!) and pureed broccolli on the plate too.  Again, each thing by itself was amazing!  Then I had the peach tart for dessert.  I was expecting more of a flaky crust.  This was more of a bread crust.  Good, but I prefer flaky crust.  My friend had the chocolate dessert and it was very rich.  Rich but very good, I just can't imagine finishing the whole thing by myself.  I would go into chocolate overload!!  Wine parings were good but the dessert wine was a bit much for my taste.    Service was okay...kinda snooty.",

I was a little concerned though once I read some of the other posts, however, I had no need to worry.  It was FANTASTIC.  We had a reservation and were seated right away.  I liked that the wine menu is electronic.  I can't even imagine how long it would be printed.  Our waiter was wonderful.  Very friendly and accomodating, for example, on one of the prefix menus one of the starters was a beet salad.  I really wanted to try it but it wasn't one the regular menu.  I asked the waiter if there was any way I could order it and he said it was no problem.  It was excellent too so I'm glad I didn't miss out.  The food was AMAZING!!  My husband had the pork and I had the salmon and both were incredible, although I thought mine was the best.  The flavors to worked so well together and the crispy skin on the fish added a great texture to eat bite.  So good!!  We ordered a lemon tart dessert.  It came kind of deconstructed, which was cool.  The lemon/olive ice cream (I know, sounds weird) was off the charts.  I would have taken home a whole pint if it was available.  Finally, the waiter had heard it was my birthday so he brought out their dessert sampler as well.  Everything on it was great as well (lemon/lime poundcake, creme brule, and two chocolate desserts).  We will definitely return.",

    "text": "This 2 star rating is an average of two visits . . . First visit: My birthday dinner.  My friends own a restaurant in Chicago - so they called ahead to let the staff know a table full of chefs were coming in for a b-day.  You know right there that we received an amazing menu, and top-notch service.  12 courses of completely phenomenal food - attention to detail was ridiculous, catering to my food allergies and my  friend's vegetarian lifestyle (which is expected at a place like Aureole, but they were above and beyond my expectations).  This was a 5-star visit - everything was absolutely PERFECT. Second visit: One year later.  I had my birthday dinner at Fleur de Lys (posted a review for that, as well).  The next night, my boyfriend and I decided to visit Aureole for dessert and wine.  It was not quite 10 pm when we arrived and were told unceremoniously by the hostess (before she even said hello) that they were closed.  I could see people still on beginning courses of their meals - so I knew that at least the pastry chef was still around.  We asked if we might sit at the bar and just have a dessert wine, she huffed and said \"Fine.\"  The bar area was full but not crowded or hectic.  We were simply ignored by the bartender for several minutes - he finally came over and we asked what dessert wines, ports, etc. were available.  He said \"just one\" and poured 2 glasses, then left us alone again [he was not in the weeds, nor even close to busy enough to justify such treatment].  One dessert wine???  In all of Aureole?  Come on.  We caught his attention again and asked if we could still order dessert, he seemed surprised that we thought we couldn't (thanks hostess).  Dessert was fine, not spectacular, and we sat and watched every other bar patron receive better service than us.  I was so disappointed, we left quickly, wishing we had tried dessert somewhere else. Perfect example of why NOT to dismiss a young, well-dressed couple - we love food, I have worked in restaurants for years, and generally know what type of service/food I should get for my dollar.  This was a total disappointment, and I have told everyone I know to try other Vegas restaurants instead - this one has turned the corner from \"perfect\" to \"pretentious\".",

It's located within Mandalay Bay, and up to the point of entrance, you have no idea what's in store. Once the host leads you through the doorway, you realize you are actually at the top corner of this grandiose space, with a winding staircase leading to the bottom that can only be compared to the famous M.C. Escher painting. This place also has a one of a kind wine tower in which a wine angel floats up and down to grab you your favorite bottle of wine!! It is a very expensive restaurant, so plan on emptying your wallet. You might want to make it a special occasion if you visit. It was a while ago that I went, but the food was delicious.",

    "text": "Sadly, I must add to the apathetic reviews after my dinner at Aureole last night. Not because of the service, which was not excellent but also not terrible, nor because of the wine program, which  lived up to its reputation overall, but because in the end the food was just okay, and what is a great restaurant without great food?  Service was actually pretty quick, though very \"entitled.\" What do I mean by that? Lots of assumptions were made all night. For instance, just after my first course, I was asked if I wanted any more bread (I had already tried one roll). I replied, \"Not right now,\" which evidently prompted the server to clear my bread plate, knife and butter. It would have been proper (and polite) to ask first. Lots of little details like this all night surprised me, given the (formerly) stellar reputation of this institution.  The food was good, but not great. I wasn't starving, so I just went for the 3 course menu -- corn chowder, cioppino and cheese. The chowder featured a tiny crab cake in the center of the dish, which tasted very fishy and was dried out from overcooking. I also had to pull some corn gristle out of my mouth, which is always gross. The cioppino had almost no flavor. Seriously. I put salt on it, which helped, but honestly it looked and tasted like someone had poured a thin tomato broth over 4 (count them) clams and a few unidentifiable pieces of fish. I could have gotten better cioppino at any seaside diner in California. The cheese was fine, albeit I received one TINY piece of three cheeses in total. I do mean small, and I do mean only one piece. Very stingy.  The wine program is obviously very extensive. That's what made this restaurant famous originally, and that's why I wanted to come primarily -- to see the \"wine angels\" make their ascent up the wine tower. Sadly, though many patrons around me ordered bottles, no angels ascended. I can only assume the bottles are stored somewhere else as well? Bummer.   However, on the plus side, I did enjoy my wine selection and service. I opted for a 2008 Christian Moreau Chablis 1r Cru Vaillons, which was $90. A lovely Chardonnay, which paired well with the chowder in particular.  One of a few interesting bottles on the long list priced below $100. Wine service was well executed and prompt. My glass was always filled at the right time and with the right amount.  In the end, a spotty meal with a few highlights. I wonder if Aureole will be retired or re-vamped? One or the other should probably happen soon.",

    "text": "Came here tonight with another couple for dinner before a show. The menu is really confusing. There's a tasting menu, a prix-fixe menu and a la cart if you so desire. It took us a good 10 minutes to figure it all out. My husband and I decided to share the prix fixe menu, which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. We chose the romaine salad (Caesar), the bleu cheese crusted 8oz filet, and the chocolate trio for dessert. The Caesar salad was good but not spectacular. They put an anchovy on the plate which was a little too much for me. I like a hint of anchovy but not the actual fish! The filet was very yummy, especially with the bleu cheese. Sharing it was the perfect thing to do, especially when you get the entire three course meal. The chocolate trio was INCREDIBLE. Churro with chocolate sauce, mini chocolate covered ice cream pops, and a rich chocolate mousse. So good. At 5:30pm on Thursday they were pretty quiet. The best place to sit was in the back where we had a view of both the swans on one side and the wine tower on the other. They also have an awesome happy hour menu!",

THIS was the place, and I believe it was essentially a mistake, for I think my dining partner stumbled upon this looking for another place that was nearby, but closed on Mondays...mistakes sometimes are decisions you do not make consciously, but turn out just wonderful in the end.  Neat.  Kind of modern...large wine cellar that you can see, and my dining partner likes this sort of thing a lot.   We decided to check it out and get something small.  I got the three cheese plate.  It was really good.  Dining partner had french onion soup.  It had a puff pastry on it with gruyere cheese, and it had foie gras in it.  Do I need to discuss how good this was to you, reader?  I think we all know that it was just great.  Enough said.  Fun times.  The service was normal, and not too Vega$-y, and the servers were helpful and nice.  We went early, so there was not a lot of crowds.  After this, we decided to go to Bouchon for more yumminess, and this is when my stomach exploded, but I have nice food memories in Vega$.",

My husband and i have ordered a salad (organic greens salad), which was good, but a bit too simple for $16. Just red and green salad leaves, balsamic vinaigrette dressing, a slice of roasted pear and a small pastry-like item. Tasted like a cream filled crepe. Too simple for such a price. I then had a pork chop which did not come with a side but did cost $42. I did order a side of Parmesan fries to go with it. Everything was tasty and presented well, but not original at all. My husband ordered ahi tuna for an entree. It was also good.  Overall experience: good, well presented food. Service could be better. Our server did not even stop by our table to see how our food was after it came out. And it was not busy at all. I would not come back though as it just felt like something i could make at home just as easily and that is not why you pay $60+ per person for dinner.",

    "text": "Had the \"Parallel\" tasting menu last night but they graciously substituted two more fish preparations for the Lamb course. We started with two raw preparations. The first was fluke and the second was lobster. Both included pineapple. The fluke had a slightly spicy macadamia nut and coconut topping. The lobster used grilled pineapple with a small green papaya salad. Both were fresh and tasty.   Next, was a duo of carrots. First, a nicely seared scallop. The other half was seared tuna on a small plank of carrot pound cake.   The third course was supposed to be lamb but they gave us black cod with sauteed broccoli and slightly spicy sauce. The other half of the course was salmon nicely with a red wine reduction.  Dessert was a baklava stack with concord grapes and ice cream in the middle. It was slightly dry and hard to eat, but the filling was great. The other half of dessert was a chocolate gelatin in a biscotti Napoleon.   It was our anniversary, so the restaurant gave us a very nice additional dessert sampler. The lemon case with strawberries was the most memorable. It was a very nice touch.  All of the food was very good and the service was excellent. The waiter was very helpful but never intrusive. The rest of the staff kept the wine flowing, water glasses full, and bread plates filled. The room is very attractive and the novelty of watching women repel up and down the wine tower is good for conversation. The food and service make the price worthwhile.",

I told the server and he just took it and walked to another employee whom I thought was manager. They did not come over did not apologize and in fact never really spoke to us again.

    "text": "Came here for a \"cheaper\" fine dining dinner with the BF. We walked alllllllllll the way from Imperial Palace to Excalibur and then took the Tram to Mandalay Bay, took us a WHOLE HOUR!!!! Under the blazing summer scorching sun. No doubt we took the taxi back HAHA.  When we arrived to our 6pm reservation, we were shown to the lower level where the whole entire restaurant sits! Trippy!! We drank tons of water and then presented our $50 GC from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. They gladly took the coupon. There was no snobbish service, but we were not shown the fancy electronic menu many people talked about :'(. They had already assumed that we weren't going to purchase wine from that menu -____-;. Well, fine. We won't order it then. HMPH. We'll just order from our cheap-o Wine Menu then. WHICH wasn't bad anyway because my BF enjoyed his wine a lot..... (GO CHEAP!!!)  We ordered the seasonal prix fixe. $65/person. 3 Courses. Since there were the two of us, and the menu allowed only one person to choose ONE of the two. We were able to try everything on this menu.  Here's my noobish review on the food:  Bread: Got the Baguette and Bacon Foccacia. BACON FOCCACIA FOR THE WIN!!!!! NOMS!!!! Too bad it wasn't warm :T  Arugula Salad on Crispy Miche Tartine, rhubarb compote, shaved parmesan cheese -I thought this was very refreshing, especially after a looooong hot walk. But the arugula started tasting really bitter after many bites. This is a pretty decent sized dish for the first course. The itty bitty extras on this dish complemented the salad well (like the strawberries and the florals) but still I couldn't handle the herby bitterness of it. So my BF happily devoured it, in fact, he actually loved the salad.  Chilled Spring Pea Soup, rosemary roasted ham croque-monsieur - Honestly, we didn't enjoy this one as much. It's good at first, but then there was so much of it (big bowl) and we got sick of it. This soup is only for pea lovers, I'd say. My dad would hate this because he hates peas with a passion, it's quite funny. The croque-monsieur did save this dish a little bit because it was warm, toasty and yummy and complemented the soup well... but not the entire soup itself. We only ate half of it-at most.  Grilled Cajun Prime Hangar Steak creamy bacon sweet corn, roasted green chilie aioli -Holy moly, this was probably the best dish here or in fact the BEST dish of mine and my BF's entire weekend in Vegas!! We ate a lot of good food this weekend too! Jeez the steak was SOOO tender and the flavor was just right!! You get the kick from the cajun seasoning so that was cool. And it sits on a bed of corn... and mashed potatoes?? I don't know what it was, but this dish was freakin' delicious!! I'd definitely order this one if it's still on the menu.  Oven Roasted Wild Northwest Halibut preserved lemon and parsley risotto / lobster - This one was also VERY good. Didn't wow me like the steak, but this was so flavorful and the Halibut was so meaty delicious! You can definitely taste the lobster flavor and if you're lucky, there's a teeny lobster piece for you to enjoy too! What I liked is that there were a few veggie pieces in this dish. I wish they added more bc I love vegetables!! but the fish was REALLY good. Won't be disappointed.  Bananas Foster Tiramisu Parfait, banana cardomom ice cream I LOOOOOOOVED THIS DESSERT!!!! I loved the spices and the ice cream was so soothing after a big meal. NOM NOM NOMS!!! This was the BFs but I just stole it from him hehehehe.  Dark Chocolate Spearmint Bar, vanilla ice cream I ordered this one and MY IS IT CHOCOLATEY! No doubt, it was very good but I think this could only be ordered by absolute-chocolate-lovers and actually finished by them too.  Petit Fours: Madeleine, Meringue, Shortbread type of cookie, chocolate, etc Delicious :)  Overall it was a very good dinner. I don't mind coming back here again :)",

He even poured a few extra glasses from the tasting menu, in addition to a few extra surprises for us.   But the dishes were delivered by different people, and overall it was very impersonal.  The guy that delivered the cheese was a total rookie.  He just plopped it down and when I asked where the cheeses were from, he responds with \"uh....this one's from France....and this...the U.S.....\" and didn't mention if they were cowmilk, sheep's milk, etc.  A $450 dinner needs more polish.  Don't go for the wine angel gimmick; we didn't see any during our meal.  The food was good, but unfortunately you don't get what you pay for.  Vastly overpriced, inconsistent service, and decent but not memorable food means that I won't return.  Rating would be lower if it weren't for the all-star sommelier.",

    "text": "We celebrated our anniversary here. Excellent food, attentive service, beautiful space. My only complaints would be the limited selection of wines by the glass (wife doesn't drink and I can't possibly drink a bottle with dinner) and the close seating for couples along a bench. I didn't get enough time to scope the place out to try and pick a better spot. But it was a minor thing until a loud couple started snuggling side by side on the bench next to us. Gag. And I did get a fine glass of wine, just not the satisfaction of going through pages and pages of wine so that I could agonize over the decision.  Anyway... I ordered the Parallel Tasting menu. Four courses, 2 dishes side by side in each course. Everything was drop dead gorgeous and delicious. There was beef, there was crab, there was salmon. I should have taken notes... Anyway, it was great.  She ordered a soft shell crab appetizer that was quite good and the Bleu Cheese Crusted Filet that even I, a Bleu Cheese denier, found tasty.  Having seen on our Open Table reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary, they brought us a complimentary dessert. Nevermind that we had both ordered dessert, it was really nice - a sextet of sorbet balls in 3 flavors. Yum.  Finally, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> had a $50 coupon for $4. That was processed with zero fuss and made the evening that much nicer when the bill came. All in all, a wonderful evening.",

    "text": "Sighhhhhh.  My wife has been wanting to dine at Aureole for quite some time so I finally obliged her and made a reservation.  Sadly for the restaurant, I'm not sure we even needed the res, and it was a Friday night.  Bread - 3 options, Rosemary, Pretzel, and (i forget the third, didn't try it).  The Rosemary was warm, fluffy, and worth a second go around.  If you've dined out at all in the last 12-18 months you probably have noticed that pretzel bread is all the rage and can be found almost anywhere.  Unfortunately, it really misses the mark here.  Maybe we were just unlucky, but the bread was room temp and fairly dry.  Apps - Here is where a little disappointment grew.  If you attempt to check out Aureole online, you will find a much different menu than what you will find in person.  I had my heart set on a shrimp scampi app prior to coming but soon found it was not available.  I was torn between two options and went with the French Onion Soup based on the waiters recommendation.  I'd say it was average, better than what you might get at a chain restaurant but not the best I've had.  My wife went with the crab risotto which was more pricey but also hearty and rich.  I would recommend it as an app to split because I think like my wife, most women would give up on the dish before finishing it.  Entrees - If you don't have an extra large appetite, the ahi tuna and scallop entree is a good option.  The tuna was high quality and cooked rare.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the spice level of the dish.  However, the portion is not very large so if your stomach is growling, you might feel like this entree is more like an appetizer.  My wife went with a lamb chop special which was nice.  The chops were fairly large in size and cooked perfectly.  Overall, she was happy with her selection and it was plenty of food for her.  Dessert - We went with the chocolate trio which is nice because it is like 3 desserts in one and is perfect for two people to split.  The fondue was my favorite of the three but the donut was not as good as a similar option we always get at Scarpetta.  Also, I forget what the middle option was called but it came with some coated bacon strips.  I think added a salty element (especially bacon) is also a very \"in\" think to do with desserts now, but the bacon here just amount to a hassle.  After only one bite it just stuck to all my teeth and was pretty annoying.  Lastly, our service wasn't bad or slow but Jerry Seinfeld might describe our waiter as a \"low talker.\"  Eventually I just gave up listening to his recommendations because I couldn't hear a word he was saying.  All in all Aureole was okay, but nothing struck me as unique or superior to the many similar options in Vegas, so I can't say I would prefer to come back versus trying somewhere new.",

    "text": "The short version: Dessert = 4.9/5, Lounge wine list = 3/5, Service = -1/5  We were offered a spot in the lounge as we just wanted a little bubbly to cap the birthday celebrations for my sis. We didn't need table service for that, so we headed into the lounge and, as directed, chose our own seating.  Grabbing a high top along the wall, we took our seats and looked around, having enjoyed the walk down around the wine tower, and generally getting our bearings on the ambiance and decor.  After about 5 minutes, we finally got some eye contact and some menus. The waiter all but dropped them and walked away had my sis not asked immediately for water glasses.  After almost 10 minutes, we flagged someone else down, explained that our waiter had not been back in some time, reiterated our request for water, and asked to place our order. While waiting, we saw a dessert sampler served to the table next to us and decided to give it a go.  The fizzy stuff came out in good time, we had a toast, and we waited, chatted, and lamented the fact that we would, in all probability, explode before the evening was out (see previous review of STRIPSTEAK ;)).  The dessert came out and we were not disappointed (nor did we care about our impending food-induced doomsday). The molten lava cake was melt-in-your-mouth perfect, the brownie and mousse had a bit of a spicy kick to it and was, overall, amazing. The strawberry shortcake was bland and a bit on the dry side, and the creme brulee was too soft (probably a result of too small a serving, the crisping of the crust alone would melt the tiny bit of creme in the dish).  The original waiter came by and asked if we were finished. We assured him we were, he nodded, and then... he left. He left everything on the table and just left. When he returned (almost 10 minutes later?) he asked again if we were finished and if we'd like the check. We again answered in the affirmative and he disappeared only to return with the bill; someone else finally came and cleared the table.  $40 for a dessert sampler and two glasses of bubbly enjoyed in the bar/lounge. That didn't bother me as much as the inattentive, slow, and inefficient service.   I am hoping a dinner experience will change my mind about this place, but I am in no real hurry to return after that.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to this experience as I had heard so many good things, and was intrigued by the wine angels and the enormous wine collection that spans 4 stories. The wine collection itself was very impressive, and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, but the food and service did not live up to my expectation.  We were seated promptly upon our arrival, and my friend and I were happy to have been able to get a reservation before the Keith Urban concert at Mandalay Bay. I started with the petite greens salad with pears, dried cranberries, and a yummy pear viniagrette. My friend had the onion soup, and it was delicious and decadent with a little foie gras inside.   Our server convinced me to try the monkfish dish on special, and I readily agreed as a love fish, especially monkfish. I was looking forward to the treat. The dish was so creamy it was almost soupy. I generally don't mix cream with fish, not that it can't be done, I just don't generally eat creamy fish dishes. My stomach was more than a little upset after eating half the dish, so I said no to dessert. My friend had the bone-in filet, and it looked and smelled fantastic; however, my stomach was not feeling up to trying a bite.   I felt fine througout the concert, but felt very sick as we arrived back at our rooms at the Bellagio. I didn't feel well all night, and woke up still feeling off. I  can't necessarily attribute my sickness directly to the food at Aureole, but something I ate there did not agree with me. Everything seemed properly cooked, but I guess I will never know for sure. In the least, that monkfish dish should not have been slathered in soupy cream. For this reason, I probably won't be back. I have many other favorites in Vegas that never disappoint.  Perhaps it's worth a try for the ambience and experience of the 4 story wine collection and the \"wine angels,\" but I would go for happy hour and save your pennies for delicious food that can be found elsewhere.",

    "text": "I came here Saturday with my friends during our Vegas trip and was told it had one of the largest selections of wines in the area. However, we did not order wine, but the huge wine tower was cool. The lovely ladies of Aureole would be hoisted up by some sort of pulley system to reach the wines.   We got there around 6:30PM and were told by the hostess that the next available table would be open at 8:30PM! So be aware, make reservations if you want to eat here. However, they did have open bar seating which you could order off the whole menu, so we went there instead. We ended up sitting at a booth and there happened to be happy hour (even on a Saturday!) until 7PM that night. I tried the Watermelon Gazpacho, sliders, and a fish dish (I can no longer recall... because... Vegas).  The sliders were very cute and delicious, but I was not a fan of the Watermelon Gazpacho. Perhaps it's because I'm not a fan of watermelon in general, but I just thought it was too cold and hard to eat (it came with one giant cracker).   I believe I ate some kind of Ahi Tuna dish which was pretty delicious, the fish was seared rare and of good quality.   I really liked the environment of the restaurant, I think you have to dress business casual for this place, but it was hard to tell given that I went the weekend before Halloween .   As expected of Vegas, this place is not cheap. However, I cannot exactly recall the prices because... Vegas... Let's just say I had a couple of cocktails during (ok and before) dinner. Perhaps this was not my most cognizant review, but I had an overall impression of the restaurant and it was good!",

The waiter even warned me that one of the appetizer breads had bacon in it which I thought was very thoughtful! The desserts were just as great as the meals! This is definitely a place to come and celebrate a special occasion.",

    "text": "My boyfriend wanted to eat here when we stayed at the Mandalay Bay last week and I reluctantly agreed because I'm not a shishi poopoo restaurant type person.  We ordered the three course meal and I had the beet salad which was around 5 quarters of a beet on a mayo based sauce and I quickly moved all of the beets to the side because I don't like mayo based sauces.  And my boyfriend started out with the beef cheek ravioli which was good.  We both had the filet mignon and it was surprisingly a little tough.  It was on on top of a little bit of greens and what I think was a little bit of mashed potato.  And both were good but it was super rich so I knew I'd be paying for it later.  And I was going to order the \"cheesecake three ways\" which included brie, cheddar and blue cheese.  And, I can hang with brie and cheddar but I hate blue cheese.  So I ordered the creme brulee with a little bit of raspberry sorbet on top.  And the creme brulee was ok (I've had better) and I liked the rasberry sorbet but they also sprinkled some pomegranate seeds and caviar on top and I had to scrape both off because the only crunchy thing I want on my creme brulee is the carmelized sugar on top and I don't do caviar.  So all in all it wasn't bad but it's not a place that I would go back to because it's just not my thing.",

When served a variety if breads, I asked for a GF option and not only did they say yes, the bread was very tasty and like a small seasoned baguette.   I ordered the tasting menu and the chef accommodated my allergy with unique options that worked well with the existing menu.   The service was impeccable. The only picky complaint I might have is about the ambiance. A frosted glass wall cut the room off and left us wanting to see more of the dining room. We only saw the bottle angels fly up the wine tower 2x and the tower lighting was such that she was hard to see. The walls could use some eye catching art -- maybe some modern tapestries to absorb the noise from the loud music bouncing around from the casino.   Overall, would recommend it to a friend.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Aureole for more than 10 years, and I can't believe I've never written a review. So I'm doing this particular review slighlty differently....   I'm going to write this review backwards.   I'm starting with desert. The cheese plate at the end.... OMG. Amazing. I couldn't get enough of it. If I didn't have a heart condition, I would have ordered it for the appetizer AND desert. The cheeses are simply amazing, and I absolutely love the accompanying honey, apricot compotes (or whatever that heaven sauce was), and nuts. I'm serious. So good I had to start with the end.  Aureole boasts the most impressive wine list in the state. You can't miss the zipline bottle girl in their 3 story wine cellar. My personal favorite red? The Yarra Yering pinot noir. Aureole is one of the few places I know that carry this wine. Its been one of my favorites since the dotcom boom.   The ambience is spaciously decadent, bright, and crisp, but I have to ding them on the overzealous airconditioning. I had to request a table cloth as a blanket because they don't carry shawls, and the cold air really killed some of the experience.  That said, the food is excellent. I highly recommend the tomato salad with burrata appetizer, followed by the scallops with langoustines for entree.  I know I mentioned the cheese plate dessert already, but for those with a sweet tooth, I highly recommend the creme brulee.   Always happy coming here.",

We arrived and were immediately led down the large staircase, past the massive wine tower to the back of the restaurant in a corner. Perfect for a quiet conversation. However, the restaurant was very empty with maybe only 3 other tables with people.  We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir. I had no idea about the \"wine angels\" and missed the presentation of them putting on a harness to get the bottle of wine out of the wine tower. You can't see it from the back corner of the restaurant and staff did not mention it.   A member of our group ordered several items for the table to share and I was able to try bites of a few items.  Focaccia & Herb Butter-So good and I probably filled up with too much bread Hummus, Baba Ganous & Tzatziki-good Chilean Sea Bass-My favorite of the dishes I tried Roasted, Organic & Wild Mushrooms-Very good Turkey, Ham & Swiss Meatballs-good Beef Cheek Ravioli-good  A perfect environment for our group of 6 to plan out the week.",

We were a group of 10 people and again, had the restaurant to ourselves. That's usually a bad indication as it was a Saturday night. Ambiance is clean, spacious and fairly quiet. The music playing throughout the night was very random (sometimes country, sometimes top 40s, etc).   Quick comment about the bread. It was not nearly as fresh nor tasty compared to other nicer restaurants. The butter it was paired with was too strong in flavor and we were not given olive oil with the bread.  We started off with a few nice bottles of wine, and the 10 of us ordered almost everything on the menu. Notable dishes were the slow roasted beef ravioli, sea bass, and the spaghetti squash. The other dishes were all fine, but not memorable.   Dessert - maple creme brulee was the best of all the dessert. The worst dessert was the '3 cheesecakes.' They tried pairing blue cheese, brie cheese, and cheddar cheese into these cheesecakes and none of them tasted like dessert nor was it good.  All around a fine restaurant, but given that no one else was in the restaurant, odd music selection, and the terrible cheesecake, I would not go back.",

    "text": "Aureole's website trumpets that it is \"one of the finest restaurants in the United States.\"  So, why was it 80% empty on a Thursday night?  Well, I'll get to that in a moment, but first let me acknowledge some of the really good stuff.  The dining room is beautiful, dominated by the four story tall wine tower that is accessed by cocktail waitresses/acrobats who \"fly\" up the tower to fetch your bottle.  An entertaining gimmick.  The food is of the highest quality and expertly prepared.  The wait staff was pretty good, although not quite up to the level you might expect from a restaurant with pretensions of being the best in the United States.  They actually seemed to be a little harried, which was surprising given the sparse crowd in there.  The problems begin when you get to the portions.  I was reminded of Steve Martin's line in the movie LA Story - upon being presented with his tiny dinner he said \"I'm already finished, and I don't remember eating.\"  I started with the ravioli (two bites worth) and had the scallops for the entree (three medium scallops).  The cheesecake dessert was closer to a petite four than a real slice of cheesecake.  We were here for Restaurant Week, so we got a good deal on the dinner; but I can see why anyone paying the high prices on the regular menu might be frustrated to pay that kind of money and walk out hungry.  So, if your bank balance resembles that of Bill Gates and you want a tasty snack, Aureole would be a good choice.  If you want a real dinner, though, you might want to join the large crowds of people who are avoiding the place.",

    "text": "I recently had the chance to go back to Aureole since Chef John Church became the executive chef and I found out that he's doing a fantastic job!  The menu changes with the seasons and Chef Church is doing some fine and very creative dishes.    I started with an amuse-bouche of an oyster with caviar and sorbet.  Good opener.  The salt of the caviar with the sorbet made for great flavor combinations.  The bread was focaccia and it was accompanied by butter with olive oil and thyme.  Next up was a beet salad with two beet \"marshmallows\" that the chef made by mixing beet juice with egg whites to make beet marshmallows.  Interesting and tasty concept.  Next came some onion soup with pastry \"pouches\" on top instead of the bread and cheese on most onion soup.  It was also topped with shaved black truffles.  This was followed by duck prosciutto wrapped foie gras torchon, huckleberry tomatoes, and sangria soda.  Simply wonderful!  The entrees started with vegetable lasagna--spinach pasta, butternut squash, mascarpone, and sage.  This was followed by Ora king salmon, sliced fingerling potatoes, smoked salmon, and white wine cream.  The salmon was so flaky and the fingerling potato slices were crisp which made for a fine balance of textures.  Then came what I considered the highlight of the meal--rack of Colorado lamb with pistachio and horseradish crust and lingonberry jus.  I think if I were on Death Row and had a last meal request, it would be this.  Excellent flavors and textures.  A complete winner.    Then, Chef Church brought out three desserts accompanied by the pastry chef who explained each of the dishes.  One was a rose apple tartlette which was carved in the shape of a rose with cardamom and rosewater ice cream and almond leaves.  The second dessert was a maple brown butter creme brulee, and finally there was coconut bananas Foster with Malibu caramel, coconut sorbet, and spiced rum financier.  I can't remember a time when I left a restaurant so full but I walked up the stairs with a big smile and thoughts of what great food I had enjoyed that evening!  This was an outstanding tasting of the various things on the fall/winter menu.  There was not one thing that wasn't completely enjoyable.  Service was outstanding as always.  Aureole is one of those restaurants to which you need to return.  I am enamored by the wine tower and the wine angel.  I can't help but look at this very creative way or storing and retrieving wine.  I highly recommend Aureole.  It is always evolving and always superb!",

We had eaten so much over the past few days and did a buffet brunch earlier that day so only ordered a few items, but all items were great! First and foremost, they had French onion soup, which I was so so so excited about. This French onion soup did not at all disappoint, possibly the best I have ever had. I never like the bread soaked in most French onions soup so I usually ask for it on the side or not at all. This soup had a delicious puff pastry over the top and gruyere cheese. WOW! It was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I shared their Caesar salad, which came with a Parmesan crisp, quail eggs, and sun dried tomatoes. It was definitely a large portion, but perfect for two people to share. Lastly, my boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli, which he loved. The ravioli was very flavorful along with the awesome red sauce. The bread and butter they brought out to begin was really great too. The bread was very, very soft almost like challah bread with seasonings. I do wish we were hungrier for more but will definitely be back on our next Vegas visit!",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to try Aureole for a work outing during a convention I was attending. We were one of the lucky ones that got to have dinner close to the hotel, so Aureole gets bonus points for that! I was a tad underwhelmed to be honest, by the food. Mainly because of the price (even though I wasn't paying for it!)  We had a larger group (10 total) and we were seated right away since we had reservations. The restaurant was packed by the time we were seated.   After taking our drink orders, bread and butter was brought to the table. The bread was so soft, and the herbs and salt that were on the crust were delicious! I believe they put the same herbs on the butter (with some oil!) which made it even tastier!  My co-workers ordered the Ceasar Salad as an appetizer, and it looked really good as well. I didn't order an appetizer, but did try some of the salad, and the parmesan crisp was a unique decoration and really tasty addition! We also did an order of Parmesan Truffle Fries, and those were a big highlight of the whole meal for me. Most places do a little too much truffle, but the fact that the truffle comes on the side as a sauce ensures you have the perfect amount every time!  For our main course, I tried the Jidori Chicken Breast. While it was delicious I didn't feel it was worth the almost $30 we paid. Chicken was cooked well, and the apple slaw that it came with was ok, but not anything to write home about. We also did a couple crocks of brussel sprouts for the table, and while they had good flavor they were a little under cooked for my liking.  Wine was delicious, and their other drinks at the bar looked delicious too. It was pretty cool seeing people in the wine tower, though!  As far as the service goes, I felt like it was a little slow. It was a super busy night, but our dinner reservations were at 6:45 and we didn't end up leaving until 9:45. It felt like we were waiting forever in between courses.   Overall, I might come back just to try it one more time when they aren't as slammed and compare it to this experience.",

Excellent choice. We sat in the back near the double fence doors. We end up having a whole patio sitting area to ourselves. It was a great romantic experience.   Alfredo made sure we were taking care of. Steak was cooked perfectly. Service was excellent.  Only thing I would say is not to put too much of the strawberry jam on the foie gras. Too much tart.  Huge variety of wine!  Would definitely come back. Love the venue!",

    "text": "The available dining options in Vegas are overwhelming so I left this one up to total chance. Since I had tickets to see Michael Jackson's One, which by the way was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!, I thought I would chose a restaurant in the same hotel as the show.  I pulled up a list of all the restaurants in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, closed my eyes and pointed at one.  Aureole was very impressively presented by its \"Curb Appeal\", so I was very excited to see how the dining experience would be.  As I walked down the staircase that wrapped around one of the most impressive wine cellar/rack/tower (?) that I have seen, I was quickly shocked/amused/impressed to see that there was a woman suspended in the glass tower that was being pulled up by wires to select bottles of wine to be delivered out to the guests.  I immediately knew that this was going to be a fun experience.  I opted to try the multi course chef prepared fixed menu with the supplemental wine paring option.  I have to admit that I enjoyed the sommelier much more than my server but that is probably because he was very engaging and was genuinely interested in what I had thought about a previous restaurant and activity that I had gone to the night before.  Having just moved from Utah, I can see this sweet young gentleman going a long way in the industry with a commitment to service like he had with myself and my guest.  Overall I felt that the meal was very good but not the best that I have had in Vegas.  I am not sure if the Wellington was a little too tough or if the knife that they gave me was not sharp enough, that being the only struggle I had with the place, but overall a great meal.",

    "text": "Although many are likely unaware of Chef Charlie Palmer's eponymous Steakhouse at Four Seasons it would be difficult for anyone visiting The Mandalay Bay complex to miss Aureole, still to this day one of Las Vegas' most dramatic rooms and a post-dinner visit on Friday once again telling of a combination of gifted individuals and exceptional product.  Toqued by the Michigan-Ohio combination of Chef John Church and Executive Sous Chef Athena Thickstun, the latter largely responsible for a menu of sweets that evolves gradually to compliment the former's focus on elegant seasonal fare, it was shortly after descending the staircase around Aureole's several-story Wine Vault that greetings were offered by the Restaurant's General Manager, a choice of seats thanks to low volume presenting a sizeable two-top at the main room's center.  Exactly 1/2 changed from a November visit, Pumpkin Bread Pudding as well as the Rose Apple Tart lost to colder weather and Passion Fruit nowhere to be found, it was with Espresso in hand that Chef Thickstun described a Creamsicle Parfait to start things off light, the mimetic Orange at the center of a large plate surrounded with White Chocolate squiggles and filled with Vanilla Ice Cream atop a dense Pistachio Cake that nicely tempered the sour Winter Citrus.   Moving next to a Brownie Sundae, Charlie Palmer's \"Progressive American\" style nowhere better exampled than in a combination of Chocolate and Peanut Butter that one-ups the similar Candy Bar at his Steakhouse by way of myriad textures and a bigger scoop of Ice Cream, it was with the last bits of Brittle consumed that 2017's North American Dessert of the year made its return, Chef Thickstun's boozy Bananas Foster just as remarkable this time around with two Almond Cakes soaked in Rum propping up cubes of Bruleed Fruit beneath slowly melting Sorbet that tastes exactly like toasted Coconut.  At this point perfectly contented yet simultaneously excited to try more it was in an unexpected turn that course four saw Athena deliver her newest creation, the cool grey skies outside apparently in need of a splash of color that she was happy to provide in the form of bite-sized \"Candy Apples\" amidst piping hot Mexican Donuts, housemade Caramel Corn and Cinnamon Ice Cream nuggets protected from melting by rainbow Sprinkles.   Opting for two additional shots of Espresso to finish, Chef Church's signature Cheesecake Trio best left for another time, it was much like the week before Thanksgiving that the night ended with Creme Brulee, the flavor of Maple Syrup this time seeming a little more prominent as the base upon which guests are treated to emulsified drops of Minus 8 Vinegar, Pomegranate Arils and bitter-sweet Cranberry Sorbet.  FIVE STARS:  While most are aware that Chef John Church has essentially reinvented Aureole Las Vegas and reestablished the Restaurant as one of Sin City's top five places for dinner fewer are familiar with Chef Athena Thickstun, though if she continues at her current pace it seems fairly certain that will not be the case for long.  RECOMMENDED:  Coconut Bananas Foster, Blood Orange \"Creamsicle\" Parfait, Bourbon Maple Brown Butter Creme Brulee.",

Not being able to see the acrobatics of the 3-story wine cellar was an insignificant issue when I found out we got our own patio area next to the swan pool, for which we were given bread to feed said swans.  Everything they did made the evening truly magical and made us feel special. The food was amazing, and when I say amazing - I mean more delicious and well plated than I have likely ever had. As a plus (and this stands out mostly because I am a tech-geek), their wine menu was electronic, like an e-book, and made finding the perfect wine very easy (as well as pointers from our waiter).

    "text": "I loved Aureole because it didn't seem like \"contrived\" fine dining, like so many of the other mushrooming fine dining options in Vegas seem to be.  Celebrity chef offshoots usually disappoint because the chef is never actually there and attention to detail suffers.  I know Charlie Palmer didn't cook my meal, or even see it, but the details are polished here and it would be hard to leave unhappy.    The computerized wine list is so much fun for the oenophile that you should give yourself 30 minutes to find what you want to drink before you order.  Compared to other Vegas fine dining, you are given plenty of great choices/vintages under $100, or you can splurge from your winnings to spend much, much more.  Service is swarming, but unintrusive, and you shouldn't be surprised to have 10+ people be involved in your experience in the course of the night.  I wasn't wowed by the food (though it was very good), but I was wowed by the experience.  Everything else was so polished, I would expect the food to be better the next time around.  Considering Joel Robuchon wants $250 and up for his prix fixe menus, Charlie Palmer's are a veritable bargain, both coming in at under $100.  Yes, it is a splurge night out, but other splurges in Vegas have been more expensive and less impressive.",

The I-dont-know-how-many-stories-glass-wine-tower made my mouth drop.  Fluffy Swans.  Ridiculously gorgeous.  My boss had made me a reservation here as he rubs elbos with Mr. Palmer himself.  We were greeted by Aureole's Manager, Kevin, and were overly fawned upon from the moment my cousin and I introduced ourselves.  I felt old Hollywood.  Our waiter handed us an intimdating mini laptop device - aka - the wine list - and asked us to pick.  I looked at him as if he grew another head.  I told him, I trust you.   \"Well done.\"  And he walks away.    I'm not going to bore you with every detail, but let me tell you that every detail was perfectly executed.  I highly suggest the lobster ravioli and for dessert, the ladyfinger - and trust me, I had a sampling of EVERYTHING on the menu.  Not one morsel of that kitchen's mouth watering concoction goodness left unturned, unbitten, or unappreciated.   Needless to say, my cousin and I were lit by the end of the night, drunk on wine, glorious food, and high on life.  We had the I-had-the-best- meal-of-my-life giggles and we were so satisfied with the evening we didnt even need to spend the saturday night at a vegas nightclub.  We found our way back to our hotel room and talked about dinner experience till we fell asleep.   And today, I still tell the story.  Charlie - open one in San Francisco!",

We were not told that there was a significant difference in price for the holiday prix fix menu based on where we were seated. We paid $95 per person as opposed to $65 per person for the same menu selection we ordered. This was not told to us and I discovered this on their website after dining here. I felt with such great service that this pricing difference should have been revealed when being offered the seating option. Privacy over dollar amount should have been our decision, not the restaurant's. I felt is was purposely hidden information and not openly advertised. Service and food was fantastic but left a bad taste in my mouth after this.",

Service was impeccable.  Tablet PC wine list is ridiculously fun to play with if you're a wino like myself.  At the end of the night, I was buzzed on amazing wine and full of amazing food, and just kept saying \"I'm a happy happy girl.\"  My friends of course thought that was hilarious, but dammit I was.    Almost went back a 2nd time during my 5 day business trip, and was more than willing to drop the cash on another orgasmic dining experience.  Yes, it was that good.  ----------------------------------------------------  January 2009 update  Yes, I went back.  And will probably make it an every-trip-to-Vegas habit.  This time we did the tasting menu with wine pairing.  Everything I put into my mouth made me smile and melt.  Have you ever been FULL from a tasting menu?  We couldn't even get through the cheese and desserts.  Stellar service yet again (except for the obnoxious drunk table of CES attendees across the room) everything was perfect.  I can't recommend this place highly enough if you're looking for an outstanding gastronomic experience.  Unpretentious elegance.  You may even see me grinning from ear to ear and licking my spoon in the corner.",

We had a nice private table in the dining room and received attentive, knowledgeable, friendly service. The food was AMAZING. I had the romaine salad, which is a deconstructed caesar that was fun and exciting to eat; salmon that was like butter; and the best creme brulee I have ever had. My husband had the rabbit confit, a perfectly cooked medium rare steak, and a chocolate lava cake with mint ice cream. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) we will try one of their many wines, but we were sobering up from a day of Las Vegas Happy Hour.   It is not cheap -but well worth the price! A refined, creative, high quality restaurant experience. I highly recommend!!",

    "text": "This is more of a 3.5 star place but that's not an option.  Overall the food and service were good, but not particularly memorable.  I'll admit that we came here to see the wine angels, and when we didn't see any going up we ordered a bottle of wine.  This isn't necessary, by the way, they offered to do a demo for us without making us buy anything.    We were seated promptly when we arrived, and while the restaurant was relatively empty initially it filled up pretty quickly.  The first thing they do is present you with a chunky tablet with their wine list; it is an overwhelming list that will just confuse you unless you're a sommellier or have really specific tastes in wine.  It's fun to play with it for 30 seconds and see what they have, but you're better off just asking for the sommellier to come by.  We did that and the sommellier came by, asked us a few questions, and picked out a list of 7-8 wines for us to choose from.  He did a good job, selecting 4-5 wines according to what we described and what we planned on ordering, and a couple other wines that he thought we might like.    Our waiter was attentive and prompt, but not as knowledgable about the menu as we like.  He didn't know what various markings on the menu were about which was kind of concerning, as an asterisk next to a description of cured meat seems like it would be important.  He didn't know what was in a few dishes as well.  Despite this, once we ordered he struck a good balance of checking on us without getting in our faces too much.  My wife ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer and I got their take on a french onion soup.  For entrees my wife had the pork chop and I had one of the steaks.  Herein lies the problem with this restaurant; I remember that I had the french onion soup and a steak, and they were good, but I can't remember much else about them other than that the portions were huge.  I remember enjoying it and thinking it was a good steak, but I really can't tell you much about it.  I'd go back if a friend wanted to go, but odds are on my next visit to Vegas this restaurant won't jump to mind.  That said, the food and service were good.  My only complaint, which most people probably won't share, is that the portions were too big.  I couldn't finish all my food and didn't have room for desert, and walked away feeling really heavy.  I like to get through three courses and not feel like I just ate an entire cow, so this was a bit disappointing.  But this is just a personal preference, and I actually give the restaurant kudos for being generous.    If you're in Mandalay Bay anyway, you wouldn't go wrong having dinner here.  But I wouldn't go out of the way to come here.",

    "text": "I'd love to give this place 5-star....because they really went out of their way to accommodate our Anniversary dinner, especially since we had a 3-month old tagging along.  I called down earlier in the day, explained our 'family situation'...and they gave us a little table off to the side, away from the other guests.  So my wife was able to nurse the little guy without making a 'scene' in the restaurant.  Big props to them for that!!  And the waiters were magnificent.  I'm sure it's a tough business to be in, especially in this down economy...but they were just the right amount 'friendly' while still leaving you to enjoy your nice dinner.  They even brought us out some extra dessert for our anniversary.  Another big props for that as well!  We decided to both go with the 3-course Prix Fixe meals @ $65/person.  We both got different items so we could sample the foods.  Overall, the food was great.  But sets of Appetizers and Desserts were simply wonderful.  And my beef sirloin was absolutely perfect as well.  The one 'weak' link of the 7 items we tried was the halibut main course dish.  It was certainly not bad...but it didn't really grab you like a main course of a $65 3-course meal should.  Perhaps we were still thinking about the halibut we had at Rick Moonen's RM place that same day for lunch, which simply had more interesting flavors to go with it AND at a significantly cheaper price tag.  The Gin and Tonic was as good as I've had in a long time!!  Very nice.  If it weren't for that one halibut dish, I could easily give Aureole all 5-stars....because everything else was just about perfect.  The bottom line is that when I pay $65 for a 3-course meal, my level of expectation is very high.  No room for error!  And unfortunately for us, the halibut just wasn't quite up to snuff.  TIP:  Aureole is one of the few Michelin-rated restaurants that will let you bring <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupons.  Considering our total bill was $170 before tip, it was nice to buy a $50 voucher for $4 through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>....for a net savings of about 25% of our total bill.",

We originally had reservations at another place but wound up canceling those and eating here.  Their wine list is huge!! They bring it out on an e-tablet and you choose bottle or glass. A server comes by each table with a variety of fresh baguette/breads. The menu had many enticing options but I ended up choosing Chef Vincent`s Market 3 course menu. Starters was breaded calamari in a slight tangy/spice sauce (yum!). Main course: Beef skirt steak in a bourbon with wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus(scrumptious!). Dessert: mango cheesecake and lemon cello ice cream, well I thought that I was supposed to get that but ended up with pistachio ice cream? Not sure why!? Bonus though since it was also my friend`s birthday, they sent over an additional dessert trio! Oh wow, more decadence!! No problem since I was in town for  a half-marathon!

It's in the lower level so either you need to take the elevator or walk down by the two-story glass enclosed wine cellar which the harness mounted wine tenders go up and down to get your bottle while tourists take photos.  Menu is somewhat similar to the New York location with a good choice of seafood and meat dishes. No matter what your liking us you will find a dish but somewhat on the pricey side.   There are bar seating, main dining room and also outdoor seating if you feel like it.  Wine list seems a lot more approachable than the New York location. Wines by the bottle from low $50s to four digits, if you have been winning big at the casino floor.  Service was excellent for our party of nine people with strict restrictions.  Enjoy!",

We arrived and we ordered the Valentine's Day special, which was clearly made prior to Vday as it all tasted old, and very below average, especially for $105 a plate. The first course had cashew puree which tasted rotten and sour, as did the vegetables included in it. The second course was risotto and it tasted like cardboard and was over cooked, and hardly even warm, I would feed that to my dog, much less my boyfriend. The third course was a Wellington that was under cooked, the pastry around it was still very raw and doughy and the meat tasted like the smell of dog food- I had one bite and pushed my plate away, as did my boyfriend. When asked by our waiter if everything was ok, my response was \"No, to say this meal was disappointing would be an under statement\". Our waiters response was an odd look, as if he didn't understand, walked away, and returned with our dessert. Our dessert was rock hard frozen, and we couldn't eat it, until we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for it to thaw out- and still wasn't very tasty. After waiting for 30 minutes to get our waiters attention, he finally returned with our $300 bill. WORST experience, a very embarrassing Valentine's Day surprise, and a complete waste of money. And to think the waiter didn't even apologize or requests a manager to attend to us. Don't waste your time or money.",

    "text": "This review is mainly for the bar. We ate in the restaurant on Christmas Day a few years ago (Swan Court) & had an excellent tasting menu dinner. But it is the bar we consistently return to time and time again.  First off, the bartenders are terrific - friendly and knowledgeable. We always sit at the bar (rather one of the tables) as we enjoy chatting with the bartenders. We look forward to seeing Dave each Christmas visit (we miss his fellow bartender David, who moved out of state).  The bar menu is delicious - sliders and French Onion soup (made with four gras) are highlights, but we usually order a few items off the dining room a la carte menu as well.  Drinks are always stellar, and often when chatting with the bartenders about various liquors, we are offered a free taste or two of this or that. I'll never forget the taste of 1972 Pedro Jimenez that we were given a few years ago - a rarity that is now nearly impossible to find.  This isn't one of those raucous Vegas nightclubs, but a nice cozy bar where you can relax and enjoy good drinks, good food, and good conversation.",

Aureole's sommelier selections tote an amazing Deumayen, \"Trez\" that is everything and then some, especially at the price point.  The service here is that \"higher level\" that you will find yourself looking for again when you are having a harder time finding it else where. Although Aureole is now longer in the tooth the newer shows of the strip; it has established its identity in its consistency and durability. The 2008 michellin is testimate.   Happy hour is a steal for approachable wines and small bites, and the bar tenders make it hard to want to leave.  On the dinner menu the steaks are enticing, the Niman Ranch Pork Chop with barlet pear tart is phenomenal.   Save me a seat at the bar and enjoy.",

    "text": "Before heading to the JAY Z concert, my BFF Lily and I wanted to grab drinks (aperitif). With so many options near the Mandalay Bay Events Center, it was difficult to make an immediate decision. Also, since Lily is visting, I told her to choose and I am very happy she chose Aureole!  We walked up to the host stand and informed the hostess that we were in search of their bar, so we were directed in via elevator or stairs. We happily took the stairs to admire the vast wine collection. I had heard of Aureole's monstrous wine collection (for the record, it is a four-story stainless steel tower of over 50,000 wines including the \"Millennium Collection\" that features the first Bordeaux growth from the 1900 vintage - HOLY MOLY) and flying \"wine angels,\" but didn't take the time to appreciate it. It is quite the sight.  Once you get to the dining room, there is another host stand when you exit the stairs and we were graciously directed to the bar behind the stars (it's under and on the side of the stairs). Fortunately, the were two seats at the end and we were greeted immediately with menus. We arrived just minutes before the end of their Happy Hour (7pm) and without even having to ask, we were given Happy Hour menus without restrictions of not being able to order. That was refreshing!  I ordered the Enlightenment (Citron Vodka, St Germain Elderflower Liqueur, Lemon, Moscato d'Asti float) cocktail for a very cool $6. It was delicious and not overly sweet and most importantly, it contains all my favorite things! Lily had The Mountie (Canadian Club Whiskey, Peach Cordial, Lemon) cocktail and it was also delicious ($6). Both were only available on the Happy Hour menu.  Since I was hungry and we were in no hurry, I decided to peruse the menu. Both the Small Plates and A La Carte Dinner menus offer the \"Artisanal Cheese\" dish ($18) and I confirmed with the bartender that it is indeed the same offering even though each menu has different names and descriptions. This cheese plate is beautiful and really, really delicious. It featured six cheeses: Big Rock Blue cheese from California, Nerina goat cheese from Italy, MouCo Pepper Camembert from Colorado, Brillat Savarin cheese from France (triple cream Brie), Goat Blue Log from Massachusetts, and Beecher's Flagship Reserve from Washington (semi-hard cow's milk cheese; aged cheddar). They served it with lightly toasted brioche and white chocolate batard, candied pecans, caramelized red onion marmalade, and wine-reconstituted golden raisins. Phenomenal. If you like blue cheese, the two offerings were great. The cheeses that really stood out for me were the Nerina, MouCo, and Brillat Savarin. They all happen to be creamy cheeses, but the flavors were just amazing.  I would absolutely order it again and hopefully when they still have these particular cheeses! I will be on a mission to purchase those favorites.  I have to devote a paragraph to our lovely bartenders David and Dave. They were amazing. The pinnacle of excellent service and craft. They were charismatic, helpful, and very humorous. Dave (or David, I honestly can't remember who is who since they had the same name) was even kind enough to supply all the cheese information so that I wouldn't forget the delicious cheeses we devoured. When I return, there is no question that I will go to the bar!",

They like many places in Vegas had great steaks but the star of the evening was the pork chop....hands down best chop I have ever eaten. The crime brulee was done perfectly it was culinary ecstasy.  The service was also great, everyone was extremely friendly and drinks was always full.  Definitely will go back next time I return to Las Vegas.",

Our menu was the three course dinner - Salad or Roasted butternut Squash Ravioli, 2nd course, Salmon, Truffle poashed chicken supreme and roasted beef tenderloin. Dessert - wedding cake!  I worked with Whitney and the rest of the management at Aureole. They knew it was my special day and went above and beyond to make sure my guests and I were taken care of from beginning until the end.  This was a destination wedding for me so I made two trips out to ensure that everything was up to par, which it was.  The reason why I left off one star was because they did make a mistake with my wedding cake. I sent pictures over prior and it was nothing like I requested. =(  Other than that, I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good wine, good food and fine dining.  =)",

The place is fancy enough with hot girls going up and down on ropes to get over priced wine. As usual, I tried the pris fix dinner. I wasn't  too impressed though it was tasty. Just not for the price. It was expensive.  I impressed my date. But I wasn't too impressed with the dishes. To sum it up, Aureole is a great place to impress a date. But not your tummy. Still, I think it's a winner.  An option is paying a third of the price and going to the buffet. It's the best strip buffet for the price.",

It comes complete with an outdoor Swan Court that's home to actual live swans making your meal even more unique. Aureole's striking four-story wine tower with its \"flying\" Wine Angel Stewards, who gracefully ascend the tower to retrieve bottles.   While the setting is unforgettable, Palmer's modern American cuisine is just as memorable as the environment it's served in, especially the Onion Soup made with foie gras, truffles and served in a Gruyere puff pastry. The taste was incredible and the puff pastry was a nice alternative to the slice of French bread usually garnishing the top. I also had their halibut which was cooked perfectly; often times restaurants over cook the fish when all it needed was a bit of resting to finish the process.",

They used to have awesome steaks and delectable sides that were mouthwatering and amazing!  This time we came to fine a short revised menu and none of the stuff we loved before.   The waiter didn't really speak English well, when we asked about the oysters and then said no thanks he still brought them out to us after not ordering them...   Oysters: Only 6 super tiny oysters for $30 and the sauces were pretty generic and bland. Let down especially since we didn't order them and still paid for them.  $110 steak for 2 had a good presentation but not much seasoning and this little flavor. Let down...   No manger stopped to see if we were happy...   All in all this place fell from grace and lost their 5 stars rating from me. I am really disappointed and bummed since I really liked it there... I actually regretted wasting date night here.   Old Review for meals prior to 2014:   The best steak and food I have had in my life!  This is the epitome me of the place that is worth every penny that you pay to delight in the most delectable flavors your mouth can imagine!  The steaks here are worth the $45-$55 a piece price that is attached to them. The flavor is out of this world!  Everything here is made to absolute perfection!

We decided to try the 24 oz Steak for 2 for $110 with mashed potatoes. I asked our server how many oysters came with the oyster appetizer for $27 and he said 6. So then I said oh okay I'll pass.   As we were waiting for our food the server brings out the oyster appetizer. TL and I both said oh we didn't order that since there's only 6 oysters.. he said oh yeah you did. We just took it since they brought it out.  The oysters were the smallest oysters ever. A little bigger than a size of a quarter. So that was unfortunate.   The steak finally came out after some time and honestly the steak just tasted bland with no flavor. Texas Road House has better steak!  I'm not sure if there's new management here, but everything was so much better 4 years ago!   $180 dollars later for oysters, a steak and mashed potatoes. We like fine dining, but this place definitely didn't meet the quality of the pricing!",

    "text": "So in the spirit of restaurant week, here is another review. This place looks fairly average save for some nice wall decor and the \"wine angels.\" The menu itself was pretty expensive but have some very delicious sounding options. From the restaurant week menu, I ordered the tomato and buratta  appetizer, the 10 oz NY angus strip, and the coffee creme brulee. Honestly everything was pretty delicious. The appetizer was the weakest point and it wasn't even that low. The steak was fantastic and the tarragon butter carried that steak to a whole new level. And for me the high point was the creme brulee. I've never had such an amazing creme brulee with the perfect thickness of the shell and sweetness of the custard. And the coffee flavor was to die for.",

    "text": "What a Beautiful culinary adventure by award-winning chef Charlie Palmer. The famous chef has amazing restaurant in NYC and California, and this one in Las Vegas is one of the best culinary experiences on the strip!  Located in Mandalay Bay Resort, Auriele is a 4-story wine cellar/restaurant. The place is unique, the dining experience is quite exquisite. I enjoyed every second of it.  The design and decor is asymmetrical and so refreshing.  The center piece is a wine cellar where your wine gets delivered to you by your acrobatic \"wine angel\" on pulleys, which makes your dining experience that much more special and interesting.  Their menu is seasonal, and we tried pretty much everything from the fall/winter menu. The food is cooked by Executive Chef Alexandre Gregoire.  Oysters (27) , crab salad, grilled octopus (24 and to die for!!) , sea scallops (45), halibut, fresh caught cod (44), spaghetti squash (22), and the sides were simply outstanding - from wild mushrooms, Brussels sprouts to insanely delicious Parmesan fries. The shellfish platter was impeccable (69).   Their wine selection is absolutely superb. Amazing choice of high quality and vintage wine. I tried their (aged) Popcorn Sutton Whiskey, Elderflower, Aperol cocktail. Delicious. We completed our dinner with delicious salted caramel and berries Beignets and house made blood orange Sorbet. Five stars.  Well paced attentive service, our waiter was great.  This was a five stars experience throughout. Amazing. I will come back.",

    "text": "I've dined here four times now and, while there are many things to like, I've never found a meal to be a fully satisfying experience. Most recently, I had the tasting menu ($110 + $55 for wine pairings). It had nice variety in the courses and a couple were outstanding (especially a halibut with baby leeks, mussels, clams, and saffron sauce) but one was too rich (foie gras with poached fig and a fig/grape compote). I didn't get much out of the wine pairings. Most of the wines themselves were quite good (and the price is a deal for the quality) but I didn't feel like they added much to the dishes. And serving a very sweet wine with that foie gras and fig was just overkill.  The decor is nicely upscale, sort of a modern interpretation of the power restaurant. The four-story wine tower with the women on pulleys riding up and down is kind of old hat now, but it's still a singular experience. The service is nicely paced but sometimes does seem to be a little hesitant in describing the dishes and too many of the servers having the annoying habit of pointing at each element of the dish as they tell you about it.  It's nicely located within the MBay casino. I would say check out the menu and if something on there looks compelling to you, give it a try. But it's not the place I'd go to experiment.",

    "text": "While attending a conference at Mandalay Bay I had the opportunity to have dinner at Aureole. As you walk by it on your way to/from the convention center, the most prominent feature is the \"wine tower\": a multistory tower used to store wine bottles. These bottles are then fetched by staff who attach themselves to a wire and then \"fly\" up and down to get the bottles. Sorry, but to me it's simply a ridiculous gimmick that undoubtedly adds to the fairly high cost of the wines.   As for dinner: the food was very good, but by no means great. Started with an octopus appetizer where  the octopus was the perfectly cooked star of the plate. But the sides on the plate were rather tasteless, lacking salt, and the potato discs over cooked.   For an entree I had the halibut. This dish was very good. The fish and sides were cooked perfectly. Yet there were bites of the fish that were quite salty, something a friend also experienced on their piece of fish, making me think there was an uneven hand seasoning the fish.  We also had a side order of mac & cheese which was just OK. The dessert was also below average: what was advertised as beignets with three sauces was really more like churros with three definitely cold sauces. Weird to funk hot item in cold sauce. So much so that we left one uneaten.   The service, however, was disappointing to me. It was attentive and inattentive at the same time. It was attentive as they were quick to refill glasses and to bring and clear plates. It was inattentive in that every time the waiter came to talk to us or deliver something, he was constantly looking at other tables. As though they were more important. Describing the menu, he kept looking completely away from us. Filling wine? Turned his head to other tables every time. So much so that when he cleared dinner plates, he left food on the table that he never cleaned up (even when putting dessert menus almost on top of the spilled food.   So it's not a bad place, but I don't think the food and service justify the quote high prices.",

Honestly it's the reason my friend and I chose it because we knew our husbands would also enjoy the selection.    With our reservation in place, we were seated immediately.  The main dining room is on the lower level.  The hostess brings you to the elevator so the ladies don't have to walk down stairs in heels.  Whew!  But if you want to walk down the stairs, it circles their glass enclosed wine tower in which a 'performer' is twirling on wires for a bit of entertainment.  The service we had was very attentive as well as informative.    My first course was the Crab Salad.  It was very light and refreshing.  The Dungeness Crab was layered on top of the avocado with taro chips lightly placed on top.  The mango which accompanied it created a wonderful bite when you combined it with the other layers.    For the entree I chose the Asparagus Risotto.  Somehow I always seem to forget how filling risotto is.  The large plate was creamy with spears of asparagus on top.  I believe they also used asparagus as a base for the risotto.  My husband ordered the beef tenderloin which I had to sample.  Perfectly done medium rare.  Each of these dishes would be ordered again on a future visit.  Lest we not forget the lovely Vanilla Creme Brulee as my dessert course. Breaking the thin sugar layer on top is just fun for me.  The fresh raspberries delightfully garnished the top edge and complimented it nicely.    I enjoyed a lovely meal at Aureole and hope for a future return!",

The service was professional and attentive with a team working to make sure we had a great experience.   We joined friends for Restaurant Week and loved all of our food. The bread basket before the meal featured a warm herb bread that was good. As expected, the wine menu is extensive and I was able to find a delicious wine to enjoy with my meal. My husband went with one of the cocktail options and that was very good.  The Tomato Burrata was an excellent start to my meal. This was full of fresh tomatoes, burrata, pine nuts, basil, and pesto. A very refreshing salad. The burrata was perfectly creamy. My main entree of Salmon was perfectly prepared with a light sauce and delicious shaved fennel. I sampled my husband's Short Rib Ravioli and Beef Tenderloin. Both of those were excellent as well.   For my necessary sweet fix I ended the meal with Chocolate Souffle  served with passionfruit sorbet. The souffle was not overly rich and delicious. My favorite part of the dessert was the sorbet that really packed the passionfruit flavor. My husband enjoyed his Creme Brulee.  I'm glad I had the chance to try Aureole and was impressed with the atmosphere, food, and service. I'll definitely add this to my list of restaurant options next time we have friends or family in town.",

I am thankful for many things, people, opportunities in my life over gthe years & Aureole was a great place in Celebration of Life, People, and Happiness!  Being a previous Restaurant Manager and knowing the business as I do, this place was incredible from start to finish.  As you walk in \"The Ambiance Begins\" as you see a wine cooler \"enclosed in glass\" that is about 3 stories high with a sexy lady retrieving the wine! So Nice!   The ambiance was special, warm, and made you feel very comfortable in a high level wine dining experience.  The staff was top of the line professional, always making sure our table was taken care of, and the manger stopped by to say high.  Very Personable and Courteous!   As you can see in the pics, is the food presentation was awesome, well prepared, and OMG every bite was mouth watering and delicious!  YUM!   Pricing very reasonable for being on the Las Vegas Strip!  I totally recommend this for that special holiday, special someone, or even a hot date.  God Speed!  Jake Out For Now!",

    "text": "As a local Las Vegan, I consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to visit and re-visit some of the highly touted restaurants, entertainment, hotels, and all the excitement Las Vegas has to offer that the tourist typically only gets one shot at.  And, usually, I am not disappointed with the offerings the many celebrity chefs have put such great effort to create.  However, after being disappointed on numerous occasions when visiting this restaurant, I feel compelled to write about it. This last experience was just last night.  After a concert at HOB, three friends walked by Aureole's and saw a sign on an easel that read something like:  Happy Hour (hours) Try our Sommelier selections of wine, and our specialty drinks.\"  So, we descend to the bar level and ask about the sommelier selections available for Happy Hour.  The waiter brings a bottle of Pinot Noir from \"California.\"  Not Napa, Sonoma, Paso, Santa Barbara, or Watts, for that matter.  It was simply from \"California.\"  We look it up on our smartphones and find that sells for $6.99.  We turn it down and instead, I order a glass of sparkling.  My friend orders a scotch and water.  The sparkling tasted like it was left in a cooler with a plate of cold cuts and cheeses.  It smelled awful and tasted awful.  My friend, who ordered a scotch and water got a tall glass of water that tasted like ... water.  It was so watered down.  It seems to me that a \"sommelier selection\" should do more than leave a bad taste in one's mouth.  Was this guy passing off a bad decision to buy a bad wine on his guests as a Happy Hour?  And, any bartender who serves a scotch and water the way this was served should be horsewhipped!  Used to be that restaurant specials were meant to highlight the wonderful capabilities of the chef and staff..  Nowadays, it seems specials are simply used to clear out the fridge of bad decisions. And, after having written this review, I have to say that Charlie Palmer is a great chef.  He has proven it time and time again.  However, there is a theory that states:  \"The whole is only as good as the sum of it's parts.\"  This theory fits my experience at Aureole's.  There are too many negatives to call this restaurant a positive.",

    "text": "My bf and I ate at Aureole in LV on February 13 to celebrate V-day sans the crowds and annoying prix fix menu. I'm a big fan of Charlie Palmer family of restaurants; personally I think it's way better than Michael Mina. Since we had such a great experience at Aureole in New York City, I thought we should give it a second try for the real thing: dinner extravaganza.   The one thing that my bf pointed out to me while we're walking down to the reception area was that the restaurant has a \"wine angel\" who \"flies\" up and down the massive wine cellar. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the wine angel since we were seated in the area facing the swan pool (yes, there were swans and they were vicious).   Two things that really stood out during this 3-hour dining experience: our single super chatty and super nice sommelier from Santa Fee (let's call her \"Bertha\" because I don't remember her name; yes, I chose the name \"Bertha\" for a reason) and the incredible food. For those of you who know me, I don't drink alcohol except dessert wine in particular Muscato D'asti. Well, Miss Bertha here introduced me to my new favorite wine: Brochetta D'acqui. I was so digging the wine; I had two glasses (gasp!). At the end of dinner, she gave us two beautiful roses and two bags of the most delicious chocolate powder covered almonds you will have ever in your life. I certainly hope she finds a boyfriend soon because she really seemed like a great gal; lose a few pounds, a little make over (ok, a lot), and some M.A.C. touchup girlfriend can be quite a catch. Let's face it: physical attraction always starts with outer beauty.   Ok got a little sidetracked on Bertha. We had a five-course tasting dinner menu, and the one thing that really stuck in my head (to this day) was the beef wellington. It is THE BEST single dish I have ever had so far. The foie gras on top of the filet mignon wrapped in puffy pastry was literally heaven on earth. Unfortunately, this dish is not a permanent menu item. But if the restaurant happens to offer it, order it. You will want more; shoot, order two dishes and take one home.   I give this restaurant a 5-star because overall it was probably the best dining experience I've ever had. Each course was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. The service was very attentive without being overbearing. We were able to take a break between courses, walk around the swan pool and feed the hungry and aggressive swans. One thing about all Charlie Palmer locations: awesome bread selection and you can totally stuff your face with as much carbs as you want. But even without the unlimited bread, Aureole will not let you down. It is a culinary journey that is worthy of your presence (and deep pocket).",

We had the 3-course prix fixe. The wine list is overwhelming. Wonderful soup and even the fried calamari (seemed out of place) was tender with a tasty rice salad. Fish and Steak entrees were wonderful. It was our Anniversary so they brought a sorbet tasting (my wife loved this). Otherwise the deserts were just ok.   We did have an issue you might watch out for. We were not offered a menu for the 3-course prix fixe ($55 before 7:00, on the sign outside) but offered a $95 4-course. We asked for the 3-course and a new menu arrived (shouldn't have to ask). On this menu the same 4-course on the other menu was now $85 (hmmm). Then our bill came and we were charged $65 (after 7:00 price). That was awkward/unprofessional. A patron shouldn't feel like they're haggling to get the dinner that is offered or at the price it should be.  Otherwise, a must-visit.",

    "text": "Was so excited to visit this restaurant on a recent trip to Vegas and it fell short of all our expectations. The sommelier and the wine was excellent and we loved the appetizers, hence the two star review. However, the service, main entrees, and desserts were horrible and we would never return.  We went with a party of 8 for an early Friday night dinner (6pm) because we had a show at 9:30 and wanted to savor the wine and food. The restaurant was basically empty and they sat us at a table right next to a room with a large wedding reception going on. I politely asked our waiter to reseat us right before the water was poured since there was no dearth of free tables and he had every excuse in the book for not reseating us (\"Oh, they're just taking their seats, it'll quiet down soon.\" \"We can close the doors a bit.\")  I couldn't hear anyone at opposite side of the table, so I pulled the waiter over again and told him we wanted to be reseated (\"But you have the best table here!\") or else we'd be leaving. On second thought, we should have just left and gone to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay Bay since we basically had a great experience at every one we tried. Finally we were reseated at a much better table. Finally.  We were appeased by the appetizers and wine. I had four oysters on the half shell that were served with lemon horseradish and tabasco. Yummy. I also had a small plate of a peach and cheese tartlet that was delish. The Caesar salad a dining companion ordered was \"deconstructed\" and looked cool, but tasted bland. But an order of yellowtail served with kiwi and watermelon puree was excellent.  Well, the main star of Aureole was the wine and its computerized wine list (given on an iPad type device) and the \"wine fairies\" that are suspended in a wine tower and retrieve your choices. We enjoyed a peppery Chilean Malbec and a buttery Napa Chardonnay that were delicious and enjoyed by the entire table.  I wish we had just ended the dinner there because the main entrees were a huge disappointment. I ordered the entree of tuna and veal which was stone cold. I sent it back and it was obvious they just microwaved it becuase the tuna (which was ordered rare) was now barely even pink. The sauce it was served in was salty and overpowering I sent it back again and they offered me something else, but by that point, my stomach had turned and I didn't want anything else. Steaks at the table were fine, but not worth the $40-50 pricetag and not as good as The Palm or another high-end chain. Two dinners got the tasting menu and were not impressed either.  Desserts came out and one called \"chocolate decadence\" basically had a little chocolate tart the size of a half dollar coin. We laughed at how ridiculous the dessert was since it barely looked chocolatey and didn't ooze chocolate like you'd expect.  To their credit, Aureole tried to make it better, though I could tell that the waiter was sullen and pissed off. They gave us $100 off the bill, gave us three plates of ice cream (which was chocolatier than the decadance) and a bottle of pink dessert wine that was unbelieveably good.  So there you go. If you go, go for apps and wine in the lounge. You'll get the same ambiance, good appetizers, and the same wine list.",

I cannot say enough good things about my experience. I highly recommend this restaurant and the tasting menu.",

We had heard several reccomendations for the chefs parallel tasting menu and that was what we went with.  First off, yes its expensive at $85 per person plus an additional $55 for the wine pairing, but its worth every penny. The parallel is a four course tasting that has two dishes per course, so it's almost like an eight course tasting.  Our favorite was the pan-seared diver scallop on a braised short rib with carrot puree and trumpet mushrooms...we would have paid the $300 for just that dish! The wine pairings were exquisite and given that they have 150 pages of wine to select from, if you didn't like what was on the parallel menu, you would be able to find something.  We did not sit in the swan court, opting instead to watch the wine angels, which are way cooler than swans, though the atmosphere isn't quite as romantic.  Our wait staff did an outstanding job. They were very attentive, happily answered questions, and were never intrusive.  As long as you know what you're getting into price-wise, aureole wont disappoint.",

The rest of the meal - service and food - was very bad.  The server was a nearly incoherent older man who ignored us most of the time. We said we wanted to have a cocktail and when he returned after some very long interval...he pushed right into 'what are you going to eat.' He was not gracious in any way...questioning my guests choices, chastising us for asking questions.  I really couldn't believe it!  He was like a caricature of a grumpy French waiter in a staid old NY restaurant. The service throughout the entire meal never got better...not better timing and definitely not better table manners. My guests had a special steak that looked good but was nearly cold by the time it was carved and hit the table.  The sides were average. I had some special gnocchi that was tasteless.  Very disappointing. By comparison, the previous night we ate at Stripsteak across from this restaurant and it was incredible and beat this experience hands-down in every way.",

    "text": "What happens in Vegas... You drink more wine than a reasonable human being should consume in a week--much less a night. But you really can't help it. Far from a Wino (subjectively speaking), it's all just far too tempting. The sommelier is extraordinarily attentive--and why not, he knows that he's got you is his cork calloused fingertips. In fact he was at our table for so long, at one point he had to politely excuse himself to tend other diners. No matter, we were well on our way to an intoxicating evening of--wine of course. I mean there's dining here too, and some it rather good. But you'll undoubtedly have too much wine to remember the sustenance.  I went with a group of friends in town for the Retail Tobacco Dealer  Association's annual trade show. Two of my accomplices were retailers, three were tobacco account executives, one doctor--and his date--and I make eight (\"here on Gilligan's Isle!\"--ironically for about a \"three hour tour\"). Being in the good graces of the Charlie Palmer restaurant family, we got the table in the back by the swan pond, three servers, two visits from the manager, and one gratis mid-course from the chef. But all of that paled in comparison to the--say it with me now--\"The wine\". Our resident expert requested the electronic wine list (they actually let us keep it at the table the entire night). The sommelier opened our two corkages then brought out several cheese plates and the first two of of our six additional bottles as we headed for wine utopia. Even the one member of the party who doesn't drink had to get in on the action. He took a sober whiff of several glasses but stayed securely buckled on the wagon.  Now the cheese plate was an ample variety, specially paired with our first four bottles of wine. My appetizer (see photos) was the most beautiful seafood manifestation I have laid eyes on, so much so that I had a brief moment of regret to corrupt its perfect presentation. The chef delighted us with a mid-course sampling of braised duck that made me long for a full entree.  And the dessert tray was a divine cornucopia of sorbets, cakes, and other candied concoctions. Yet conspicuously absent from my recount are main courses. That is not to say there is nothing to speak of, but in comparison to the grandness of the ancillary offerings at Aureole--there really wasn't anything to sing about.  Perhaps due in part to the fact that, we were forced into the tasting menu since Aureole refused to split the table orders. We were decently satisfied with our selections from the tasting menu but acknowledged that we wouldn't remember it beyond our nightcap at the blackjack table. And with the check plus gratuity grossing $1600 ($200 per person--a significant portion of that being wine) you want to have more to talk about than the wine, the wine computer, the wine pairings and the wine steward.",

    "text": "It's all about their wine.  Let's put this right out front.  I'm a wine snob.  Check that, i *want* to be a wine snob, I just cant afford to *be* a wine snob.  So of course I selected Aureole because of it's legendary wine list.  Because it's all about their wine.  Walking into the restaurant, the stairwell winds around the famous wine pillar.  Your decent into the eatery gives you a close-up view of the Plexiglas, temperature controlled behemoth. I thought I would get a close up view of the \"Wine Angels\" zipping up and down, but unfortunately, there was no action in the tower, despite the fairly full restaurant.  It was a little like walking through the local wine shop.  A lot of wine, but no pretty women zipping around on cables.  Obviously, Aureole isn't focused on the \"Wine Angels\"; it's all about their wine.  I was a little surprised when we sat down with our menus, but were not automatically presented with the wine list.  As an aspiring wine snob, I know that I need to view both menu and wine list simultaneously to pair the best wine with the food I'm going to eat.  That's when I realized the catch to Aureole; They offer -almost push- the fixed price dining with wine parings. Therefore, all the wines being paired that night will not be in the big tower, but someplace far more convenient for the staff.  It makes sense, but I wanted to see girls swinging from cables.   So I asked for the wine list, with the intent of ordering a bottle from the top of the pillar.  It may be all about theie wine, but I can't pass up a good show, regardless of the cost.  I got the wine list - a computer tablet that is so vast, it's practically useless.  You can narrow selections by country, region, and varietal, but not by something more useful to me, like flavor notes, or tower location.  So now I have a list that allows me to select from seemingly every wine in the world, and now I have to narrow it down to one or two.  And I want it to be high up on the wine tower, on the side I can see from my table.  This is clearly not the objective of Aureole.  They want to give you a great meal with a wine they have already selected.  They even charge you an extra $10 per meal if you sit in the swan court, out of the view of the wine tower.  It's all about *their* wine.  Next the sommelier came over to help us with our wine selection.  He was only 15-30 seconds behind the wine list, so clearly we were not expected to actually peruse all 9,865 bottles.  It's more like, \"ok, here's the list you twit, now let me tell you what you want.\"  They probably carry your favorite wine, but it's all about THEIR wine.  We intended to spend the evening here, so I figure I'll start with a cheese course (steering clear of the prix fixe menu) and the sommelier unwittingly insults me by saying most people go straight to the reds, since that's what I did in my first 15 seconds with the tablet.  In reality, I was looking up a pricey wine that I am familiar with - so I could ballpark what their price mark-up is.  Now all bets are off.  I tell him I want a bottle from the top of the pillar, so we can see the girls zipping around.  Once we know what that wine is going to be, then we can build our meals around that.  He talks into his lapel like a secret service agent and ZING!  A Wine Angel zips to the top, left and right and back down again in a little flying demonstration.  My mission was a success, and I didn't have to actually get a $2000 bottle of wine.  I was off the hook, quite cheaply, and Aureole maintains their goal of keeping it all about their wine.  As for everything else, we ordered and the food was great.  The sommelier selected wines by the glass for us (that were also the same wines that they were serving with their fixed price meals) and it was all very good.  And we got out cheaper than we would of if we got the 3 course fixed price dinner.  It was a 4 star dinner, and a 5 star sommelier, but his inferring that I was a commoner will cost them a 5 star rating. I am a commoner, but he shouldn't treat me as such.  The atmosphere was also pretty poor - too many tables, and the wait staff was stretched too thin, a real 3 star effort in the dining room.  But as critical as I can be, Aureole earns 4 stars for the excellent wines served with our dinner, because...  Well, you know.",

Uneventful, standard restaurant decor: we had the seats inside for a dinner, not sure what would be the view towards the outside like.  Uneventful, standard food: had the 4-course tasting menu with wine pairing, cost about $150 before tax. I can barely remember what I ate when I was recounting the day at night.   - First course: some kind of raw fish sashimi, tiny bits of grilled lobster with grilled pineapple. No taste, goes horribly with the earthy white wine.   - Second course: a scallop on top of a stewed beef. Average but tasty... but you can rarely go wrong with beef stew and scallop.  - Third course: some grilled lamb loin. Forgettable, neither good or bad.  - Fourth course: the grape sorbet is very fresh with a heavy concord grape flavor which I liked. The whole dessert is overly sweet.  Overall, average, uneventful, forgettable after $200 a person. A lot of time tasting menu takes so much time and so many courses I always felt stuffed, but this one I walked out hungry... Won't go back and won't recommend anyone to go.",

I had NO idea what to expect from this place. We were in Vegas this weekend to meet up with my fiance's mom, aunt, step sister & two sisters who were all visiting from various states. (mostly back East) His two sisters decided to book our Sat night dinner at Aureole. The restaurant itself is quite impressive with it's high ceilings and monstrous wine tower. They friggin have wine stewards PROPELLING up & down to get your wine! Like wine rock climbing! It's crazy.....anyway, we started off with our $17 cocktails which were good, but c'mon now....$17?! Whateva...then we were served our amuse bouche (yup, I learned that from Top Chef..haha) that was absolutely amazing. I can't remember what everything was, but it was all great. Then we were given our choice of the Chef's Tasting Menu (like 7 courses...forget how much it was) or your choice of First, Main & Dessert courses ($85). We all opted for the later of the two. Personally, I couldn't handle 7 courses.   For my first course I ordered the butternut squash raviolis in brown butter sage sauce.............ohhhh good lawd, really, it was pure ecstasy in my mouf. (I'm salivating right now thinking of it) For my main course I chose the Mediterranean sea bass w/blood oranges. It was really good, but I think I prefer Chilean sea bass. It just tastes better when it's endangered.....I kid, I kid. No really, I do prefer Chilean sea bass tho. Anyhoo, for my dessert I chose the Caramel/Chocolate souffle w/banana & Bailey's ice cream. I'm no chocolate fiend, but this shit was tasty.   The service was great....until the end when we waited FO'EVA for our check, but eh, whatever. Bill came to about $110 per person (7 of us) which wasn't too bad. The best thing was my fiance's mom & aunt picked up the bill!! (super generous) All in all it was a great time and I'd definitely go back on someone else's dime! ;)",

We started with a small plate of the sirloin sliders, which was tasty, but could of used a kick, complimentary bread and butter were also given. For the bread they had a good variety. For my main course I had the tai snapper, which was okay, but not something I would order again because the flavor was too mild for my liking. My counterpart ordered something chicken supreme, which I loved, and the plating was also very nice. We didn't have any wine that night, but we did have dessert, which was free because it was our anniversary. We were given a plate of 6 assorted pastries and a plate trio of sorbet, all of which were good. In the end we were given two small boxes of goodies made by Megan Romano, and I believe that each box contains something different, one had chocolate cashews and mine were chocolate truffles.

We were mostly curious to see the Wine Angel get harnessed and fly to the ninth story of the wine rack (you've gotta see it to believe it) and retrieve us a bottle of Pinot Noir. Instead, we ponied up to the bar to chat with Norris (the bartender) who talked us into tryng the Angus Beef and Foie Gras Sliders.  Oh my freakin' lord!  Paired with a nice glass of Sauvignion Blanc, this was an unimaginable taste experience. We decided to add an order of Crisp Rick Shrimp Beignet, which--while not being the culinary epipheny that was the Angus Beef and Foie Gras Sliders---was pretty damn good as well.  After two appetizers, two glasses of wine and an experience I will never forget, the tab came to all of $40. I've spent that much for lunch a Denny's before.  If you're in Vegas and staying near Mandalay Bay, forsake the $40 or $50 you were going to blow on Deal or No deal penny slots and check this place out.",

    "text": "It almost pains me to give it 4 stars instead of 5... almost. when i think about the 3-hour dinner, the rating is justified.  As with most of the famous chef restaurant ventures in the lovely town of Vegas, the decor is opulent. But what makes this place unique is their center column wine rack and the wine angels that retrieve the bottles. About 5 years ago when we came by, the angels were scantily clad Vegas girls. Now, they're fully clothed servers. Eh, I guess they felt the attire to be more appropriate. Whatever.   Food was excellent, as expected. The wife had the parallel tasting menu. Due to some food specificity, we requested that some components be substituted. The chef had no problems doing so.   Preparation was impeccable and tastes were truly deserving of praise. The only disappointment was the 2nd course on the parallel menu of salmon prepared 2-ways. Neither were truly impressive.  Service was my biggest complaint. The server(s) were extremely polite, friendly, and present. However, the speed of the meal was painfully slow. Typically, 2 hours is my max allotment. 3 hours really tests my patience. Perhaps the kitchen was backed up. Maybe they just expect you to dine and converse for 3 hours. If so, this is not my type of dining experience.  Nevertheless, this was a very pleasant experience. I feel fancy now having ate here.",

The food, though, didn't really measure up.  It was okay, but I expected brilliance to match the price and setting.  (I almost want to rate this a 2 out of disappointment.)  I have to admit that the portions were excellent sizes -- no skimping on the appetizers or entrees.  'Entertainment'-wise, I was a bit sad that throughout my leisurely dinner I only saw the wine angels do their thing twice, and once was because a high roller specifically asked to see it.  I understand that it's not a guaranteed thing, of course -- it's not a show -- but as one of the restaurant's main showpieces, I just expected the tower to be more utilized.  Would I return?  Probably not.  It was only okay and there are plenty of other nice restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "So....Another hit during the annual girls' weekend at Vegas trip was Aureole.  You may have seen it on the Food Network Channel, they have a huge wine collection in a glass encased tower, and they have \"angels\" girls on harnesses to retrieve the bottles.  Since it was our last night in Vegas, we decided, what the heck, let's try the Tasting Menu....Seven courses...we can handle that!  The first course was a tuna tar tar, so different that the bluefin tuna at l'atelier...it was stacked on top of some sort of pear chutney....not really my favorite.  But the crab ravioli. God that was so good.   Squab paired with pan seared froie gras.  God. so good.  The froie gras was so perfect. one of my eating companions had a near orgasm over it, much to the chagrin to the rest of the table.  But inwardly....yes, it was good.  The filet mignon was seared to near perfection, and with the shepards pie.  yummy!  And with a bottle of nice red, the food kept getting better and better.  the dessert, not too found of.   Sort of neat, as the Chef came out to the table and talked a little bit with us.  Nice guy, sort of quiet. Not the personality you would think that a Chef would have.  I've alwasy thought of kitchen industry to be a foul language, rough and tough gang, with tattoos, chemical dependence and possibly a rap sheet......  Food! Great! Would I go again.  Yes.....Damn, vegas has a lot of great places to eat!!! only so little time, and not enough stomach space.  And an added plus, that L'atelier didn't have....a really hot waiter. Hmmm....maybe next year!",

Everyone was very pleased with the attentive service - they even covered up our plates with these silver covers when we went to the bathroom.  All the food was very delicious, I loved every part of my meal.  If it weren't for the multitude of other top foodie choices in Vegas, I would definitely visit here again.  I hope to return someday!

    "text": "Was invited here for a dinner with some business colleagues.  Our host asked if we were all cool having the 'tasting menu' which was basically a 5 course menu sampler.  Since he was paying, I didn't argue :-) (about $80/person).  It was fantastic.  Eclectic mix of flavors and things I didn't think about before.  Each course featured a key ingredient, but then prepared in 2 different ways.  It was a great way to sample the Chef at Aureole.    It is hard to describe the type of cuisine in this place as based on some of the things they serve you'd argue it is Latin flavored...but it didn't really have a cuisine signature.  Don't let that stop you though...there is something for everyone.  If you like wine, this is the place with the tower wine rack.  They have the 'wine angels' (which I think should be called Wine Ninjas based on what they wear) who get on wires and pulleys to get your bottle of wine down.  The one thing I didn't like was the photographer.  Some random lady came to every table taking pictures.  For the type of place this was (and prices) that was unexpected and a bit annoying.  I thought I was in a fine dining place, but then I was temporarily transported to a vegas splash mountain camera experience.  Then she comes back with pressure to sell them.  Again, just odd and out of place for a fine dining experience in my opinion.  Our host was gracious enough to buy the pictures for us, which was nice, but I felt he shouldn't have had to feel that pressure.  Note to Aureole: ditch the photographer and let people enjoy their conversation and dinner.",

I am a very patient diner, so that is something that I would almost never do, but that's how bad the service was.   The place is also laid out weirdly.

    "text": "I hate to 2 star this place since the food really is exceptional, but in a city where there are a million restaurants willing to take your $100/head meal, you are going to have to do way better than just have good food. The bar staff really needs a lot of work here...  The whole bar staff was clearly fake. You feel like you are the centerpiece of a southern belle dinner. The tone of their conversation to you, and the stupid jokes they drop could pass very well if you were on the croquet court hanging with the Docker's models all with pink sweaters worn over your shoulders. They were like airline stewardesses with plastic smiles chiseled into their faces. (Hopefully, one of those analogies rang a bell with you...). This whole environment made me feel ultra-uncomfortable, which of course made me very nitpicky...   I sat down at the bar since I was dining alone, and the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink. I told him that I really liked traditional drinks, and wondered if he had something awesome in his back pocket that he could mix up. He told me that they made \"award winning\" appletinis, cosmos, and some other glammed up sugar bullshit. Seriously, this is the best you could think of?? minus 1.   So, I asked him for a gin martini, and wanted to know what gin he had on the bar. He could only list the boring shit off the top of his head (tanq, bombay, etc.), he had to go sift through the bar to figure out the interesting kinds of gin he had. He then asked if I wanted a twist. This seems to be a major problem with Vegas since I got asked it at more than one classy place...martinis have olives. *ALWAYS*. If you ask if I want olives or a twist, then you clearly don't know how to make a martini. Minus another 1.  He then makes my martini and gives me the check. No mention of food or anything. At this point, I'm convinced that he was trying to kick me out of the place. Like, to the point where I started looking around at how other people were dressed. I also thought about trying to find a mirror to see if I had a giant booger stuck to my chin. I nearly walked out after paying for my drink, but the bartender did notice *after I had finished the whole drink* that maybe I would want some food, and asked if I wanted a menu. I decided to give the food a spin, and was treated to a fantastic swordfish. Like I mentioned before, kudos to the chef...its sad that his great meal was really hurt by bad service.  With the exception of the cool wine tower/cellar thing in the middle of the room, the bar decor sucked...it might as well have been a wall street bank. I dunno, maybe it would be cool if you were here for a business dinner, or if you wanted to shag your significant other. I couldn't think of any other party that may feel less out of place here.",

This is a high-end restaurant that runs the way a high-end restaurant should.  I ate here as part of a business retreat, and therefore, we had a slightly limited menu.  What was available was very good--no complaints here--but not so memorable as to justify 5 stars for a restaurant of this price.  Still, if you're near the Mandalay and looking for a great dining experience, Aureole has to be near the top of your list.",

Food was pre-selected, and shockingly, I decided to pair their house cab with the steak.  Caesar salad, and a lobster bisque rounded out my meal, with a decadant chocolate cake to follow.  The key element of the decor is the wine tower that's enclosed in glass, where one can watch the servers find, select, and retrieve wine.  I'd be curious to try the food on a non-set menu, but the quality was fair -- and it was free, which always makes things more tasty.",

    "text": "This was the most disappointing restaurant my husband and I ate at in Vegas.  First came the bread, which was clearly not fresh (maybe a day old?) and the butter they served with it was cold and hard - straight from the fridge.  For an appetizer we decided to split the fresh king grab leg and red crab fritter.  What came out was two small pieces of crab, it could have been snow crab for all I know, topped with some tobiko and an aoili and two small pieces of basically a mini eggroll of crab.  I tried to be optimistic thinking they'd pack a lot of flavor, incorrect.  In fact, quite flavorless.  Next the entrees - my husband ordered the 24 ounce porterhouse and I ordered the herb crusted lamb.  The porterhouse was chewey - he gave me a few pieces and the new york strip portion was just bubble gum, the filet portion was pretty decent but couldn't compensate for the cheweyness.  He asked for a steak knife, but they said the knife he had was the right knife, he had a lot of trouble cutting it and kept mentioned hands hurt through out the meal because of how tough the steak was to cut.  The herb crust on the lamb was actually pretty good, but other than that it was just average.  Throughout the meal my husband kept noticing they kept putting our silverware in front of us improperly, which seemed strange to us.  I was still hungry after the lamb, so we ordered dessert.  I got the molten cake and my husband ordered the creme brule (the special that day).  These were very good, and the only reason I gave 2 stars, but you can't really screw up dessert - can you?",

    "text": "Aureole is a tough review to write.  On the one hand, the food and decor is absolutely fantastic.  A very cool and romantic room to have dinner in.  On the other, unless you've won some serious coin gambling and are just spending your own cash, be prepared to walk out of there with a slightly empty feeling, like - that was really good, but was it several hundred dollars for two good?\r \r As soon as you make your way through the casino to the door, you walk down a circular set of stairs around the most amazing collection of wine you will probably ever see.  I won't go on about this because others have mentioned it, but needless to say, it is indeed impressive.  (Guys, there is an elevator there that you should offer to bring your women down in - high heels and this stair case don't go so well together.)  Once we made it down, we were immediately seated. No table in the place seemed bad, although our table was positioned in such a way that one of us ended up sitting on the divider between two cushions, kind of like having to ride bitch in the back seat. Again, small nit, but one would think they would have considered such a thing in a meticulously designed space.\r \r We ordered the 7 course tasting menu but selected our own wine (which you order off an HP Tablet PC.)  The staff were helpful and attentive and not snobbish at all.  Even the wine professionals were courteous and un-assuming.  We probably dealt with at least 6 or 7 people throughout the evening, each of whom brought out different courses and explained what they were.  The food itself was fantastic; appropriately cooked, displayed beautifully, and tasteful.  Dessert left much to be desired however; I suppose that's a risk you take when you are at the discretion of the tasting menu instead of being able to pick out your absolute favorite.\r \r All in all Aureole was a great place to go and I would go back again, but there was just something missing from this place that won't let me give it 5 stars. The ultra-modern decor? The cushion thing? The dessert that was slightly off?  Having to drop multiple c-notes on a dinner?  I don't know - judge for yourself. It's worth the trip to Mandalay Bay but don't be surprised if you walk away asking yourself if it was really worth it.",

    "text": "For my 30th birthday, my wife and I decided to check out Aureole. We wanted to go somewhere fancy and just (over)indulge our senses. We chose the Swan room, where diners get the occasional glimpse of swans swimming past the windows.   From the moment we arrived, everyone who worked there was extremely welcoming and friendly. We received pre-meal appetizers as we tried a glass of wine, and all of it was delicious. The dining path we chose was the Parallel Tasting menu, and boy were we pleased with our decision.  I tend not to try new foods in restaurants, especially when it's pricey. This night, however, I was determined to expand my culinary horizons and explore these dishes with an open mind. I'm thrilled that I did this.  What You Get With the Parallel Tasting:  First Course YUZU MARINATED LOBSTER TAIL    ARTICHOKE VEGETABLE SALAD AND BASIL AIOLI  -AND-  LOBSTER AND SWEET CORN FRITTER    KUMQUAT CHUTNEY, BEAN SHOOT SALAD  ALBARINO, IBERIAN REMIX, CENTRAL COAST 2008   Second Course OVEN ROASTED SEA BASS    PUMPKIN RISOTTO, SAGE BUTTER SAUCE  -AND-  SEARED SWEETBREADS, PUMPKIN FIN TART    PUMPKIN SEED OIL VINAIGRETTE  PINOT NOIR, AMBULLNEO, SOLOMAN HILLS, SANTA YNEZ 2006   Third Course GRILLED WAGYU BEEF STRIP LOIN    WILTED TATSOI, MARINATED ENOKI MUSHROOMS  -AND-  BEER BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB    APPLE-SHALLOT CONFIT, BACON JUS  CABERNET FRANC, ROBERT SINSKEY, VANDAL VINEYARD, CARNEROS 2005   Fourth Course TOASTED ALMOND TORRONE BOMBE    CHOCOLATE CANDIED NUTS  -AND-  CARAMEL ALMOND TART    DARK CHOCOLATE ESSENCE  EISWEIN, KRACHER, AUSTRIA 2008  The food and drink was extremely pleasant, the tablet used for wine ordering was great for us techies, and we saw the swans all night. What truly made the evening, though, was the outstanding service we received. Everything came to the table precisely when we wanted it. Having worked in food service, I can tell you that this takes a very attentive and coordinated server. We were never short on water, the food was always the right temperature and no dirty dishes remained on our table for more than a few minutes after we completed our courses.  I HIGHLY recommend Aureole (and the Swan room) for any couples looking to enjoy a romantic evening filled with mouth-watering food, awesome wines and a relaxing ambiance.",

He took his time, made suggestions, helped us along and never made us feel rushed.  He created a great dining experience for us.  And the GM, Bernard, is outstanding.  He thanked us for our business, made sure everything was up to our expectations and then made recommendations for another dinner the next night.  Not only did he made recommendations, he called and made reservations for us and called us the next day to confirm.  Talk about taking that extra step!    The food - wow.  Beyond good.  Each course I found myself saying, \"no, this is my favorite.\"  \"Oh, this one!  This is my new favorite.\"  Each course was better than the next, which is saying something when the first course is so outstanding.

Nice walkway with a long staircase down.  You get to appreciate a glass wine tower on the way down.  People actually get tied in and fly around getting bottles.  Pretty cool.  After Bouchon and Olives I was hoping this place was going to rock.  Some reviews have complained about the bread but it was great when I was there.  Clearly fresh.  The focaccia was AMAZING.  I had three pieces.    We got the $85 Palmer tasting menu.  First round of duets was crab based.  Both were awesome.  Plenty of flavor.  One reviewer commented on the papaya not being ripe but I think that's the point.  I'm not going to get too detailed on the flavor, but I'll just say both dishes work and are decadent.  Awesome stuff based on my Michelin experiences.  Second round of duets was salmon based.  I think these rocked too.  Shout outs to the extremely good sauces and great sun dried tomatoes.  They really stood out.  Better than anything I can get in fine grocery stores.  Third round was some wagyu and diver scallop.  Scallop was perfect.  Wagyu was very flavorful and accompanied but some awesome mushrooms.  One reviewer commented it was very tough, but from my experience some of the greatest cuts of beef are very tough.  This isn't filet mignon.  The meat was very flavorful and the sauce was amazing.  Desert was a bunch of different things.  Didn't blow me away.  However the sorbets were interesting.  The cantaloupe one was great.  All in all I think I'm starting to like Charlie Palmer more and more.    I would definitely go to this place again.  This joint would survive in NY, which is certainly not True of plenty of Michelin star restaurants out here.",

I do not expert rock shrimp or bay scallops on a fine dining tasting menu. The service was cold and unprofessional. Truthfully the only edible part of the whole meal was the dessert course.Food going back untouched should have been a red flag to the kitchen and dining room staff.

Entrees: NY strip. well-prepared, great sauce, generous size. Sea scallops: agree w earlier postings that these were excellent. Electronic wine list was (as posted already) very confusing to navigate. We took the recommendations from the sommelier after we had made our food choices and ordered glasses. Everything was excellent and well paired w the foods.  Atmosphere was fancy and perfect for a romantic dinner. Would definitely come back here next time I am in Vegas.",

I missed it by a year or so, but have made my way there about seven times now, and seems to have lost nothing since it opened. The whole Swan Court seating was a bit much... I like fine dining but I'm not too pretentious. I don't do the wine pairing either, as I'd rather just swig down Veuve Clicquot during the entire meal anyway. But this place is just fantastic... From the staff to the wine tower, I love this place.",

I'm in Vegas a few times a year and never miss an opportunity to dine there. the ambience is very elegant - it's a wonderful respite from the pandemonium of the casino floor. The walk downstairs into the dining room is breathtaking and watching the wine angels is great sport.  The menu is all prix fixe, with 3, 5, and 7 course tastings, with or without pairings. I've tried all, and the 5 and 7 course meals are a ton of food, so I stick with the three. The menu is interesting and diverse, and I haven't yet had anything that I just didn't like.  As would be expected, the wine list is expansive, and takes the form of a tablet PC so that diners can make their selections from a live database of inventory and the wine angel can go fetch it if it's not behind the bar.  Service is attentive and gracious, with elegantly attired staff swooping in and out delilvering bread, clearing plates, refilling water, etc. You get what you pay for, of course. One doesn't get out of Auroele for less than a Ben Franklin per person, maybe more depending on beverage selections.  And be prepared to invest a few hours. When I did the seven course meal, i got there at 6:30 and left at 11. I was tired but very satisfied.",

In fact i think at times people fool themselves into thinking their $50 scallop is amazing just because the portion is so small and it's expensive.  As a frequent eater all over the place, I've learned to be much more critical.   I've seen this restaurant featured so many times on the Food Network, Style Network and more.  The center of attention is this GRAND scale wine center, where their \"wine angel\" is harnessed and suspends inside selecting your wine for you.  For the price point of the restaurant, some of the dishes were better than others.  The sliders were mediocre, but the Venison in this apple puree was so good that everyone thought it tasted like lamb, there was no gamey flavor at all.  Though I didn't try it, I was told that the clams were quite delish. Not sure if I'll go back, but it was definitely a nice place.  I wonder how such a large restaurant only has ONE mens bathroom stall.",

Needless to say, we stayed at the other end of the range and ended up with a very nice bottle in the $40-50 range.  My roast chicken was the best chicken I've ever had, literally. It was delicious.  We had brought a $50 gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> that we bought for $6, which helped with things.

Both were perfectly cooked, came in great sauces and had great side vegetables.  The restaurant and lounge did seem pretty empty for a Friday night at 8pm, but that was fine by us.

    "text": "Aureole looked sophisticated and classy when we walked by, so we changed our reservation from Fleur to Aureole.  That was a huge mistake.  We dined on Sunday at 8:45 pm.  The staff was weary from the weekend, perhaps.  We lost 3 of 4 staff before our entrees arrived.  They were out of the halibut. The bread was chilled. Not just room temperature, chilled.  Service was slow.  Which would not have been a problem, except I was brought the wrong steak, and was then pressured to accept it, because the one I ordered was inferior anyway.  I was assured I would not be charged the difference in price, but I ordered the steak I ordered intentionally, because it was the one I wanted.  Meanwhile the steak wasn't cooked to order anyway.  It was rarer than I requested.  A lot.  So I think it was a truly stray steak.  Or the staff didn't want to say they were out of the halibut and the New York steak.  We poured our own wine half the time.  Our last remaining server invested in the group next to us, to the point of offering club-going advice and comp options, but blew us off once he blew my order.  It was sad to see a giant nearly whole bone-in filet get sprinkled with the crumbs off our table without a question whether we wanted to take it and our nearly whole side of quinoa to go.  Aside from the swan court venue, a terrible experience.  I recommend N9ne if you need a perfect steak, or Craftsteak, or SW or Sage or Nob Hill or Botero or the Wynn buffet / Cosmopolitan buffet before I would eat here.   Unless you are forced to eat here for a business dinner or you are fully comped, then I would eat the risotto or onion soup, and that's it.  The wine list is impressive, but not worth the bad food drama.",

It was a nice oasis from the crowds flooding the rest of Mandalay Bay.  The wine tower they have is definitely worth a look.  It's a pretty neat system where the wine stewards get in a harness and have to zip up the side of the tower to get the bottles high up.  The tablet PC wine menu also gets them points for the fun factor for gadget geeks like me.  We had a very good Australian grenache, and a few of their desserts.  Both the wine and food were excellent.  I will say that the wine was EXPENSIVE.  There are not many bottles on their list that I would consider good deals (or even truly affordable for that matter) but the ambiance and service still merit this establishment five stars.",

    "text": "I remember seeing this restaurant on a traveling show once and I knew I had to try it when in Vegas. It was exciting to see the wine tower and the wine angel.   I purchased a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for this dinner.  The service was excellent.  We got seated right away and served quickly.  The only bad thing was that we were seated so close to other couples and next to the server station and had no privacy at all.  It was like being on a double date with strangers. Unfortunately, I was not feeling well so I did not order wine but my boyfriend did.  I love the high tech wine list that came on the electronic tablet.   The pinot noir was great.  We ordered lamb and tenderloin entrees and they were delish.  The bread was also a plus.  For a Saturday night, we were served pretty quick... in and out in less than a hour.  We made it to our 8 o'clock show with time to spare!",

    "text": "Meh. Nothing stood out at this restaurant. Me and my GFs came here for a special occassion dinner and majority of people left disappointed and probably still slightly hungry.   We started with bread which was not warm and seemed a little stale. For the price point and quality that this place is supposed to be at, I expect fresh baked bread.   Next were appetizers which was a 50/50 hit and miss. French onion soup was good, it had little pieces of foie in the broth, they do like a puff pastry crust and the cheese is on top of the pastry so it's more like a cheese shell, you don't get the melty gooey cheese in the soup. Seared foie gras was very good, it was two nicely portioned pieces of foie. Octopus salad was not good. It has no flavor at all, not on the octopus or the accompaniments that came with the dish. Not even enough olive oil to hide the dryness of the octopus. My friend ended up sending hers back, I really wanted to send mine back too but since I was sharing with another person we did eat a good amount of it already so decided to just pay for that poor appetizer choice.  My entree ws pretty good. I got the branzino. It's skin was crisped nicely and the fish perfectly cooked and seasoned. I felt bad for the rest of the table because I don't think anyone else liked their entree. This was definitely a downer. Also our waiter didn't seem to care too much when we said the octopus was not to our liking. He did take it back, but reluctantly.   Considering how disappointing the food was and the service was just OK, I would not come back.",

    "text": "This is an amazing restaurant in many ways. The service sublime, the \"wine angels\" entertaining, and the food precise. So why would a restaurant that rated as one of the best wine destinations by Wine Enthusiast magazine only get four stars from me? Because the downstairs bathroom floor was chipped and disgusting and because it took over THREE hours for two people to eat dinner here.  My suggestion: when the waiter asks if you are seeing a show later that you need to keep dinner short, just say, \"Yes.\"  Unfortunately, I can't abide by restaurants that don't keep their bathrooms in decent shape and have slower service then if I had made the food myself and cleaned it all up, too.",

    "text": "Easily one of the best food experiences I've had in my life. When I think of impeccable tableside service, ambiance, and food quality, it's difficult to beat what happened at Aureole. Continue reading about my magical adventure below...  8:15pm, Saturday night, dinner reservations for 6. We're seated immediately next to our own personal patio with lounge chairs, a fountain, and a swan. Yes, a mother f-ing swan. Alfredo was our attentive waiter for the evening, and we also had a great sommelier. They explained the courses and specials very well and made sure we had enough time to decide and continue our fine dining experience. This man was a professional. Sure, the bottles of Fiji water were $9/bottle, and our drinks were pricey ($8 - $whatever/bottle of beer or wine), but never were we ever wanting for anything, and Alfredo always knew how to time our plates with conversation, extra bread, or exceptional information. Appetizers included the crudo, octopus salad (tender, succulent grilled seafood here), and special-of-the-night gnocchi. Soft pillows of dough and perfectly cooked vegetables awaited me, alongside a thick, but no heavy white sauce. Perfectly seared ahi tuna steaks and divers scallops came next, and a wonderfully light, but perfectly burnt creme brulee finished off the night. Did I mention there is a gigantic wine tower at the front for you to gaze at while you walk down the stairs to your seats?  Points to note - the aged steak is fantastic (you will not get a poorly timed or cooked meal here), the sauteed mushrooms and pommes puree are absolutely a combo you must put together as two sides, and adding a lobster tail to your meal never hurts. If you are going for the 38oz house-special steak, you should definitely split it with someone else. The fact that they cut off the bone and leave it for you on the side is just ridiculous attention to detail. Even when you walk away (and move to your amazing personal patio), people will quickly come around to change your dishes and cutlery and refold your table napkin. This is True fine dining. Remember to make it worth it and dress to the nines!",

    "text": "I can't speak for most of the food, as we only stopped by this place for their happy hour on our way to another event. I found it funny that their happy hour literally only lasted 1 hour (5:30-6:30), but it worked for us timing wise. The place was kind of cold and sterile looking and the staff looked surprised and unprepared for our arrival. For the happy hour specials, they offered a sommelier's choice of sparkling/white/red for $9, beer for $5 and a signature cocktail for $10. They also had several appetizers available for $9. Pretty good deal by Vegas standards.   Our server had no idea what the wine choices were. So I asked him to find our what type of red they were offering, he walks over to the bar, comes back and says \"Australian\". Seriously. It's a WINE bar and this dude could not have known less about wine. I took a chance and ended up with a decent (not great) Syrah blend. We also ordered several apps, including the Oysters of the day, the Serrano ham, the cheese board, and based on the server's recommendation, the sliders. He failed to mention the oysters were cooked (Rockefeller) and they were terrible. The cheese board literally came with two pieces of cheese about 2 inches square, 4 giant crackers, a blob of honey and two pecans. The Serrano ham was a decent portion, but nothing special. The sliders were indeed the best item on the list - the meat and the truffle aioli were fantastic.   I assume they must at least step up the service level (if not the food) for dinner, but I would probably not come back here and definitely wouldn't recommend it for happy hour. Oh, and those famous flying wine angels? Not there for happy hour either.",

    "text": "Aureole has flashes of brilliance, but, overall, it felt like maybe another theme restaurant that might be resting on its past laurels.  We were seated on time but then handed a electronic tablet to select our drinks from.  Totally out of character for a fine restaurant IMHO.  Felt much more Applebees than what you'd expect from a Charlie Palmer restaurant.  Drinks and appetizers were excellent, as well as service--at the beginning.  More later.  My date ordered a tasting menu, and I ordered the Niman Ranch pork chop.  My pork chop was disappointing.  It arrived sliced on a bed of chard and deep fried pig ears.  (I'm not grossed out by the pig ear concept, but their crunchiness annoyed me more than accent the flavor or texture of the chard.)  My chop was terribly dry near the bone and at the other end.  I simply can't figure out how they cooked it to have shoe leather quality meat at each end and appropriate juiciness in the center.  That said--even for the center--the meat had too much fat for a chop.  I prefer a solid, juicy, whole chop--not this presentation.  My date's main course had to be returned....with me eating in solitude....due to the kitchen ignoring allergy warnings.  The restaurant promptly addressed it, but this definitely takes the shine off a special occasion dinner.  Service:  A large party was seated nearby during our meal, and our waiter tended to them.  The problem this created was a LONG delay in my date's final course from the tasting menu.  So, the cadence was noticeably off.  I was finally offered a dessert menu whose pages were stained in several places from drink spills, etc.  This is off-putting and not projecting the image I'd suspect Mr. Palmer would want.  One of the stained pages was an advertisement to buy Charlie's books.  The irony wasn't lost on me.",

    "text": "***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***  Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.  In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).  I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:  (Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).  (Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.  (Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.  The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.  (White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.  (Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.  (Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.  The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.  (Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).  The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).  (Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.  There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.  In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).  For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.  Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.  Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).",

    "text": "I'd like to start off by saying that we have been wanting to try Aureole for years... Their wine lounge is this wino's idea of AWESOME! Unfortunately, with so many great restaurants in Vegas, and typically staying in hotels more north on the strip (Palazzo, Wynn, Bellagio, etc...), we hadn't had the opportunity to. But, on this trip... we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and so, Aureole was absolutely in our game plan.   Originally, we'd planned to dine in the Swan Court section of Aureole on the last night in town (we already had plans with friends, every other night of our 7 day trip), but I couldn't wait. After perusing Yelp for awhile, I discovered they had a wine lounge... a bar area... right underneath, basically, the famed wine tower. We could go on night one for a drink and maybe an app or two, prior to meeting up for dinner with our friends. SCORE!   We come down the beautiful staircase, my eyes fixed on the wine tower, and there it was. A table for us, right in the lounge! We were psyched  to get to experience it and so excited about it.   Our server, Renaldo, asked what we wanted to drink and we asked for a wine list, naturally. He brought us a tablet with a digital wine list (certainly not cutting edge, but pretty cool). We wanted some time to enjoy looking through the massive amount of offerings. Since we're just having pre-dinner bites, we opted to try their wine flights. So far, so good....   And then it all went downhill....   Renaldo came back with our flights (we selected different ones) and headed off to check on another table. I started with a California Cabernet (my fave) and upon smelling it, knew it wasn't \"right\". It had clearly turned. When Renaldo returned, I informed him of this and he got defensive and said that it most certainly had not. It was a new bottle, he'd opened it himself. I said, well.... then it's a bad bottle. This is a spoiled wine, I'm pretty into wine, so I know when it's rotten. He went over to the bartender (and we watched the entire transaction with him), he asked the bartender for the bottle of Cab, the bartender shows it to him and it's got, maybe enough for a 3oz pour. Hardly a \"just opened\" bottle. He'd lied to me. He didn't open it. It had been sitting, for who knows how long, and turned. Clearly.   Renaldo came back to the table with a fresh bottle, clearly annoyed with me, and poured my glass. And THAT is a how a Cab should taste. But why the drama? I wasn't rude, in the least... I just simply had a bad glass of wine and asked for a new one. A perfectly reasonable request, by anyone's standards... and most certainly in a fine dining establishment that has such a big \"wine\" presence.   Next, my hubs and I decided on two apps to share... the seared foie gras (our fave) and a lobster \"special\". After ordering the lobster special, my husband inquired about the other lobster dish on their main menu. Renaldo said it was very good but we probably wouldn't want it because it \"cost more\"... really? We just ordered a $29 appetizer... the 3rd most expensive on your menu (trumped only by a seafood platter and caviar), clearly we weren't price sensitive.   I am sure people come in and order a fabulous bottle of wine and enjoy the tasting menu and probably spend more than we were planning to that night... but we had plans to come back to do JUST THAT! We just couldn't wait and wanted a sample. Never judge a book by it's cover buddy... isn't that fine dining 101?   After much debate... because I almost NEVER ask to speak with a manager at a restaurant... I did, I asked for one. I explained my experience and I explained that I wasn't talking to her because I wanted something comped. My husband and I have more than enough money to pay for our meal. She offered anyway, and I declined. I even still left 18% gratuity, because the food was fabulous and once the wine situation was settled, that was great too. I didn't want the people that share in those tips to be short changed. I do want to note- I typically leave 25-30% tips. So 18% is a big deal... to me that indicates terrible service. I give 20, for just meeting basic expecations.   I spoke with, Rebecca, who kept saying that my complaint seemed strange because Renaldo is \"one of the best captains\"... and that may very well be True, but I didn't really find it very professional. It was as though she too was questioning my experience. She offered me her card.   The following day, I sent an email to Steve Mainini, the GM. He promptly responded to my email and offered to help ensure we have the kind of experience we'd hoped for. He said \"Please know your observation is well founded and I am  certain we can make your next visit an exceptionally positive one\"... I let Steve know that we wouldn't be able to on this trip, but will touch base on our next.   I'm going to give Aureole another chance, via Steve. I want, so badly, to leave loving this Charlie Palmer creation.   Until then...",

    "text": "So we went in a few nights ago for my girlfriends 30th birthday. She's been wanting to eat here since last December when she had a friend in town for a birthday but they were under renovation so waiting until her 30th seemed like the best idea. We are both in the service industry so we try not to complain but this particular experience was horrendous! There were 9 of us, all local bartenders and servers, & I feel like our server (Orlando) just wanted to usher us in and out as fast as possible, knowing he would get his tip no matter what. (Gratuity was included.) My girlfriend is a big wine drinker so she was excited to pick a nice bottle and have the server pair our meals with it. As she was guided through the wine menu, by the server assistant she explained that she wanted them to pretty much pick our meals, our server didn't seem to care, his assistant helped her more than our actual server. We have no complaints on the meal it was fantastic. I had the chefs choice pork chops and she had the cod. The wine she ordered was poured once, when she ordered it, never once was it offered throughout the meal or the 20 plus minute wait for dessert. When we initially sat down we explained that we needed separate checks... that was completely disregarded, at the end one check was dropped, over 30 minutes went by as we waited for the check to be split & Orlando made it out to be a huge inconvenience which really began to frustrate me. I was presented with one check and charged and then presented a few minutes later with another one and charged again. I don't mind paying for what I had but being in the industry and seeing how this was all handled was ridiculous. When we got up to leave my girlfriend then noticed that the bottle of wine was still more than half full (in an ice bucket off to the side)and Orlando had no intent on seeing if we even wanted to take it with us, she and her friend poured it themselves when he finally came to the table to tell them they couldn't take the glasses with them.   For over a $200 meal I feel like I would have gotten better service at a PF Changs.",

First off we werent terribly hungry going in because we had eaten a late lunch around 5, so we just wanted to order a small entree each and have a couple of drinks, but then we found out that there is a set meal 95 bucks per person. The waiter was nice enough to let us order entrees only though. My friend got the surf n turf and i got the halibut. Both were dissapointing. My halibut was not seasoned at all and was a bit fishy but my potatoes and asparagus were both pretty good. Her  surf and turf was a veal and ahi tuna, except they were covered in a marinara sauce that was not so great, and the marinara was not so complimentary to the ahi. At least they were able to redeem themselves with a fantastic dessert! We had sorbet and bananas foster. Im not so much into sorbet, but it was so so so good, and even better was her bananas foster. Every bite was fantastic, so kudos to the pastry chef.  It wasn't a horrible experience- i just wouldnt go back unless it was for dessert!",

My fiance eventually went to another restaurant asking what is going on and they explained to us Aureole was closed Sundays now because of slow business.

    "text": "We stayed at THE Hotel at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.  Since we were there we decided to try Aureole for dinner.    The GOOD-  1) The location and scenery were great! The 4-story wine tower is incredible to look at and fun to watch the ladies in their \"Mission Impossible\" suits go to get the wine bottles. 2) The food- read below for more information 3) The service was as good as I've had at a fine dining establishment.  From the lady serving bread, to the man who took our order, to the Sommelier who recommended a nice bottle of wine.  The OK- 1) The restaurant is a pricy place to eat.  It was over $300 for the two of us.  But I guess you have to expect that in Vegas! 2) The wine list is quite cumbersome so if you are like us and aren't the smartest when it comes to wine, it's hard to pick one.  We're both fans of the red wines, especially Zinfandel's from the Dry Creek area (Healdsburg, Sonoma County) and they didn't have many wines from that region to choose from on their list.  The FOOD- We both ordered from the Chef Vincent's Market Menu. The Salt and Pepper Calamari has got to be some of the BEST I've ever had.  It didn't need any dipping sauce and the calamari pieces were perfectly lightly breaded so that you could taste the calamari, not just the breading.  I had the seared Rainbow Trout and it was good.  I wasn't a fan of the skin being served along with the fish, but I ate around it and the fish was really tasty.  The white asparagus was overcooked for my taste, but the whole dish itself was prepared well and seasoned good.  My boyfriend had the American Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak and he LOVED it!  There was nothing left but an empty plate when he was finished.  For dessert I ordered the Salted Caramel Bomb cake and my boyfriend had the Orange Grand Marnier Creme Caramel.  Both desserts were great, but my favorite was the blood orange sorbet served with the Creme Caramel.  It was to die for!!!  We also ordered a bottle of 2007 Joseph Phelps Cabernet Savignon that was really good!   Overall, our experience at Aureole was awesome.  Hopefully we will be back to enjoy another great dining experience!",

We decided to choose a Malbec and was persuaded to try a different one from the 3 my husband was contemplating.  Nothing to write home about and after entering it in to my Vivino app and learning that this $65 bottle is sold for $17, it explained it.  I expect a mark up, but feel like we were directed to a bigger money maker than the others would have been.  My husband chose the Lamb, it was good, but not $55 good.  A little on the dry side, which I find hard at medium rare.  The sausage side that was served beside it was the best thing on his plate.  I had the duck, and loved the sides it was served with and the portion size of the duck was good too, but the duck itself was very dry and almost tasteless.  We ordered additonal sides of the Duck Fat Fries and the Tuffle Rissoto.  We LOVED both of the those.  Really wished by the end of the night that we would have just spent $30 on the sides and saved ourselves the $200 bill for a disappointing meal.  The service was very attentive and the atmosphere light and quiet (that might have been because of the time of night we were there).  I'm guessing we hit them on an off night or maybe at the end of their shifts based on the great reviews and longevity of this resturant, but we will not be back to test that theory.",

Monkey is not sure there is an unappetizing selection on the menu.  The chef even prepared a special carrot soup for Baby Monkey, then came out to meet her.

    "text": "What a shame.  A friend and I, both self-proclaimed foodies, came here for dinner last week, and it started off great.  The restaurant is beautiful, the towering wine cellar is amazing, and everything on the menu sounded great.  In addition, the prices were quite reasonable!  We each ordered an appetizer and an entree.  My friend also ordered a side dish, spinach gratin, to go with his entree.  The service unfortunately was a bit slow.  Bread took a while to come out.  Drinks were not refilled.  Slight annoyance, but I forgot about that after I tasted the food, which was fantastic.  I had a yellowtail crudo which was out of this world good, and my friend had a seared foie gras with strawberries, which was interesting and delicious!  Our entrees arrived (a halibut in Japanese broth, and a mediterranean-style escolar, both very well prepared), but my friend's side dish was nowhere to be found.  We assumed that the waiter would deliver that separately after dropping off our entrees.  But unfortunately, the waiter never came back.  He did not even come back to ask if the meal was ok.  We did flag him down eventually and ask about the gratin.  He said \"Oh yes!\", and quickly walked away.  No doubt he forgot about it.  We continued on with our delicious meal.  As we took our last bites, the side dish still had not arrived.  We decided to cancel the gratin, but by the time we found our waiter, he was already bringing out the gratin.  There were no apologies about the delay, no excuses made, nothing.  He dropped it off like it was nothing.  My friend (knowing how sharp tongued he can be) was already holding back and very nicely hinted to the waiter that we were already done with our meal.  Our waiter said \"Well, this is still good, it's still hot\" and walked away.  Trying to not let this incident ruin our meal, we let it go.  However, it quickly became apparent to us that this spinach gratin was quickly thrown together in a hurry.  The spinach was watery and there were no signs of this being a \"gratin\", in that the cheese on top was barely melted, there was no crust, no browned cheese... it was just a mess.  It was disgusting to the point where I would not even expect to eat this at El Pollo Loco or Koo Koo Roo.  Our waiter asked how the gratin was, and we told him it was not done very well.  He said \"Ok, I'll let the kitchen know.\"  His attitude by this point was he felt we were just bothering him and wish we would leave.  My friend finally said, \"No, we were already done with our meal, this side dish came late, and on top of that, it was gross.\"  The waiter said annoyingly, \"Ok, I'll take that off your bill, oh geez.\"  Mind you, this is a high-end restaurant in Las Vegas.  I was very surprised and disappointed in this attitude.  If it weren't for the service, I would give this place 4 or 5 stars.  But the service ruined the experience and for that, this place gets 3 stars.",

    "text": "Oh, Aureole.  I think you've single-handedly squelched my love for Charlie Palmer.  Granted, I am sure that he wasn't in the kitchen making my food that night, but still.  My husband had previously come here and wanted to take me for serious meal and some wine angel action.  So much for that - looking for a romantic night, we were seated next to a European couple who were clearly drunk and fighting with each other their whole meal.  And the restaurant was about 25% full yet we were seated next to the drama squad.  Eek.  We both had the 9 course menu with wine pairings and every single dish needed editing.  A sublime seared diver scallop with beurre blanc was lost under a mess of pea shoots that negated the gentle flavor of the seafood.  Kobe beef came with about 3 too many garnishes that proved distracting from the main event.  After about four courses that I'd call no less than a hot mess on a plate, I was tired.  And I mean exhausted.  I kind of just wanted to leave, take a nap, and then figure out something to eat for dinner.  Maybe I was asking for too much in expecting to be wowed, but when a chef takes the time and energy to plan out nine courses with intricate wine pairings, you should feel excited and envigorated with the presentation of each course.  Instead, it was more like the staff came out almost mechanically, trying to get us through each course and then get us on our way.  I felt the lack of love at every turn, and I was so hoping that this place would be on my list of favorite dining experiences of all time.  Not by a long shot.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt that it's the Parallel tasting menu thats just okay and perhaps the regular menu lives up to the other high reviews.   First the service was excellent: warm, attentive knowledgeable staff and food came out in a timely fashion.   The breads were not warmed and the baguette borderline stale. For this price point you expect better.  Neither of the foie gras apps were great. One an over chilled molded version with a chocolate sauce and the other shaved with a salad and pomegranate seeds that were difficult to eat and ruined the creamy texture of the foie gras.   The fish over spaghetti squash was a real disappointment with underseasoned squash and over cooked thick cut pancetta that was almost inedible. The parallel dish, a squash rissotto was very good, which made up for it.   The beef and cod cheeks were a solid 8.   Very nice desserts. Delicious semifreddo and pear desserts. Would not go back; for Almost $300 for the two of us, I really expect a higher standard of food. Sorry Aureole",

    "text": "This rating is a combination of two elements, food and service.  Food = 5 stars, Service = 1.5.  Food:  I have dined here twice.  I do not recall what I had on my first visit, but I know I left happy and someone I was with at the time said it was one of the best meals they ever had.  I went again a couple weeks ago and got the Parallels menu.  If you are unfamiliar that menu comes with five courses.  Each course has two distinct dishes with one common ingredient.  I have never seen anything like this and loved the concept.  Everything was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed every course.  One of the people I was with ordered the salmon and was not happy with the the dish, not the way it was cooked (overdone).  Service:  The service was done in a team of two.  The first server was very nice, gave us our menus answered any quick questions and then disappeared forever.  Too bad.  Our second server was terrible.  Horrible at answering our questions on the menu, always in a huge hurry, and didn't seem to care at all about the service.  Although I did not buy the wine, I will add this from the person who did:  The electronic menu SUCKS! and our sommelier was great and very helpful.  A restaurant of this caliber has to excel in all areas and sadly Aureole nailed the food 75% and completely blew the service.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this dining experience, as did my dinner guests.  I thought the restaurant was lovely, the service was excellent, and the menu items were varied.  We were initially given the wine list which is overwhelming to say the least.  Having that much wine to choose from was a luxury but also a curse!  We ended up with one red, one white, both in the $75-$100.  The list had bottles in all price ranges, which is good for all budgets.  My group decided to do the regular menu which was a prix fix where you pick an app,  an entree and dessert.  We considered the parallel tasting menu, but there was a beef wellington that wasn't on the tasting menu.    The popular apps at our table were the wild mushroom risotto, lobster cappuccino (bisque) and the seared tuna niciose.   All got rave reviews.  For Dinner, most of us had the beef wellington which had a layer of fois gras between the pastry and steak.  It was decadent and delicious.  The server brought us a sampling of sides for the table, which was awesome, but we ended up barely touching the side dishes because the dinner was so great.  We ended with dessert and the pear dessert was the standout.  We also got a sampling of sorbet, which was amazing, and I am not one to waste time on sorbet.  All in all, it was a fantastic meal and the service was awesome.  If you can sit in the swan court, you will have access to the outside patio which is a nice place to enjoy your after dinner drinks.  Based on other reviews, I would return, but expect that the great service we recieved was because it was a weeknight.",

    "text": "The Skinny: great menu concepts however suffers from really poor execution (2.5), service - very friendly and helpful (4), value - not that great considering the food is not that good even with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon(2)  We visited Aureole after a 7pm show on a Monday night. We ordered the Charlie Palmer Parallel Menu which is a 4-course menu but is served as a \"duo\". The tasting menu cost $85/person but we used a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for a better deal.  It made me really sad to see how they served bread here. They precut the bread and left it sitting out for hours. In this arid climate, the bread gets really dry and hard - especially the baguette.   The duo of crab came first: a crabcake with papaya and a crab/ahi tuna salad with thai curry flavours. The crabcake was okay but the papaya clearly wasn't ripe enough so it lacked sweetness. The crab salad faired better however texturally, it was a bit mushy for my taste.  The duo of salmon was my least favourite course consisting of a smoked salmon rolled in pasta and salmon on top of fennel with beurre blanc sauce. The pasta came out as a large clump of dough -  a total textural violation. The tomato sauce tasted like bad barbeque sauce. It was not good. Fortunately the salmon with fennel faired better but was definitely underseasoned and overcooked.  The final savoury course was a duo of scallop and Australian Wagyu skirtsteak. The scallop dish was done well and was well above the best dish of the night. The Wagyu beef however was tougher than some dried out jerky. Not to mention, it was real skimpy on the yummy sauce that came with it.  Dessert is usually a redeeming point with me. However there were definitely some timing issues with the preparation. The mocha lava cake, which had great flavour, was overdone and dry. The lemon/blueberry semi-freddo was nice but the bottom part that was supposed to be crunchy, wasn't. The blueberry financier was good but was a little too sweet. The best thing on the plate was the blueberry sorbet.  Service was wonderful and engaging. Our server got the wine angel to go up the tower so we could watch without ordering wine. He also comped us the mocha lava cake.  Now if only the food could live up to the service, this place could have been wonderful.",

    "text": "My wife and I and another couple recently had our \"Vegas Grand Finale\" dinner at Aureole.  Our friends had dined here previously and loved it so we gave it a shot.  Before dinner, we had drinks at Red Square next door which has an amazing vodka selection.  If you're really crazy, you can go into the ice room where you have to wear parkas and shoe covers.  My wife wasn't down for that because she was wearing fancy shoes for Aureole.  Aureole appears to no longer have long tasting menus and instead has a four-course (which is really 8 courses) \"parallel\" tasting menu.  Each course is brought out on a plate with 2 halves to eat side by side.  Basically, we loved everything they put in front of us.  The beet sald and the duck were particular highlights for me.  The wine pairings were excellent and they provided VERY generous pours (something I consider a hallmark of a great tasing menu).  The quality of wines were outstanding (Inniskillin for desert, all right).  We had a blast at Aureole.  The servers and food were great and we'll definitely go again sometime.  The only negative thing I can say is not once (not even once) did I seen any of the wine fairies go up the tower.  My wife said she saw one when we were first walking in but I missed it.  Oh well, there's more than enough great reasons to have dinner at Aureole.",

Finally ate here and enjoyed the $65 3-course-menu. I think for the price, it's quite worth it since the portions are all of a decent size and quite tasty, offering solid flavors.  The 3-course has an option for an appetizer, entree, & dessert. I would say that their forte lies in the entrees. The pork belly & seafood dishes were both very delicious.  The desserts were just okay, nothing spectacular.  Of course, the wine list is also very impressive. Honestly, I was surprised to see a plethora of somewhat affordable wines. You can find some great wines for under $50.  For a 2009 1 star Michelin rated restaurants, I think Aureole is worth checking out...it's a great spot for business meals (think CES!) or a romantic night out. The wine and ambiance is nothing short of impressive, but the food is just good (won't blow your mind). Overall still, a solid restaurant in Vegas!",

    "text": "I was so excited to finally visit Aureole, after not being able to visit about a year ago. The concept of \"wine angels\" sounded really cool and, online, the menu looked really good. While the restaurant is certainly elegant and upscale, the service was terrible. We ordered wine from a massive and confusing electronic list of wines brought to the table by a person believed to be our waiter. However, after waiting about 30 minutes, we still had no wine and had to flag down the bus boy for more water, as well as finding someone to tend to the wine order. The appetizers were good (I ordered a cheese plate); however, they would have been complimented by wine. When our wine finally did arrive, it was brought by a completely different server, and our waiter was no where to be found.   Then our entrees arrived, one of which was not what had been ordered. Once the correct plates arrived, they were delicious, but our experience was already tainted. We were never able to order more wine, and never received more water. In fact, the only person who was attentive was the woman who brought around bread. Although we were given a complimentary dessert (a plate a small cookies), it paled in comparison to the poor service. I've received better quality service in a truck stop. Though the food was good, for the price we paid, the service should be top quality as well. And while the impressive tower of wine is cool, we saw one wine angel the entire night. Totally overrated.",

Our group of 8 bachelorette girls, all dressed in red,  arrived at 6pm (early for dinner) so we were outnumbered by serving staff and showered with love. We all ordered a-la-carte (not pri-fixe), and the food was pretty fantastic.  - bread: the pretzel bread was strange - too salty. rather than butter, it needed some wetzel's pretzels dipping cheese! - Pineapple Mojito: their specialty drink. It was a good mojito, but I couldn't taste the pineapple! - Porcini ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale: excellent and filling dish. The bitterness of the kale balanced out the creamy, soft texture of the ravioli. Porcini was aplenty - Salmon Entree: delicious, but to me, slightly overcooked and dry in the middle - Roasted Chicken: juicy and excellent - Tenderloin w/ Crab and Sweet POtato Mash: perfectly cooked and soft meat. The crab complimented it very well - Pork Chops: cooked well, but tasted a bit too gamey for me.  One of my friends found a white \"hair\" in her dish and told the server. He apologized, and later the owner/manager returned and explained it was a brush bristle. He assured us that the dish would be taken off the tab, and gave her a NICE bag of gourmet truffles. Now THAT's service.  I give this place 4 stars because prices are pretty up there, and I think the dishes could have been seasoned with a bit more risk/flavor. This is definitely a place to try at least once - you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I wish I could do 3.5 stars, I don't feel comfortable with the 4 stars, \"Yay I'm a fan\" but it was better than \"A-OK.\"  It was an odd night.  It was restaurant week, so I'll give them that they were probably a bit busier than usual.  We were a bit of a larger table, so I will say that might have been tough.  The first misstep was when we were in the bar grabbing drinks before and we were scolded by the server for walking up to the bar to get our drinks...after we gave our drink order to the server we never saw our drinks.  We were seated and had to reorder drinks.  So that was a weird start to the evening.  The rest of service was great so it was odd that they had this large miscommunication to start things off.    Most people at the table got the restaurant week menu.  The first course was a choice of a salad which was frisee, poached egg, foie gras torchon and bacon lardons or a mussel soup.  Most people got the salad, I think they were impressed that they had foie gras on a restaurant week menu.  But it is restaurant week, it was pretty hard to find the foie gras the pieces were so small.  They said it was good though.  I ordered the foie gras appetizer for my first course.  It was a large piece so they definitely didn't skimp on that.  However it wasn't fully cooked through, there were veins that hadn't melted yet in the piece of foie and had to be sawed through with a knife.  Odd.  It was still tasty and maybe it was just a rare misstep.  My boyfriend got the french onion soup and he said it was delicious, it is served with a puff pastry top that is pretty and tasty.    Entrees we all ordered from the restaurant week menu.  There were two options.  One was a duck leg confit with lyonnaise potatoes and wilted greens.  The other option was braised beef short ribs and seared ahi tuna with kimchee brussel sprouts.  I had the play on \"surf and turf.\"  It was the best part of the meal for me.  I was kind of curious what a braised beef and rare tuna dish would be like, but it was just amazing.  The textures and flavors were all just stunning.  It was a hit.  The Duck confit looked good, everyone liked it.   Dessert options for the restaurant week menu didn't include any chocolate.  I basically don't waste calories on dessert unless it's a chocolate dessert.  I ordered from the regular dessert menu, it was a chocolate tea creme brulee.  It was ridiculous :)  Desserts seemed to go over very well.  I would rate our experience a solid b+  service was actually great after the odd start to things.  Our server was very accommodating and it was nice to be able to kind of mix and match our meals.  The food was good to very good.  I have a lot of restaurants to go to in Las Vegas but I can see bringing some out of towners to impress them at Aureole.",

    "text": "Okay, I don't know what has been going on with other diners, but our experience at Aureole was awesome.  I can't belive Aureole lost its Michelin star last year.  A few of the dishes we ordered, on the a la carte menu, two (the ricotta ravioli appetizer and the veal shank) were two of the best dishes we've ever encountered.  And we've eaten at the French Laundry, Joel Robuchon, etc.  They served a steak knife with my veal, but I didn't need it.  The brazed meat fell apart with the touch of my fork, and the warm spices, beans, and strong salty prosciutto tortellini melded in a symphony of fall flavor.  My wife's salmon ricotta ravioli is one of the best to or three things we've ever eaten.  The creamy texture of the cheese supported the decadent salmon and vegetables perfectly.  It's simply indiscribable and a must-order.  The waiter recognized as much (he asked my wife if she'd ever been there before, as she had ordered two of the best things on the menu.)  The service was almost top-notch (the interaction with the sommelier and the waiter was a bit awkward, and the table next to us didn't get their coffee with their dessert). The electronic wine tablet is a great idea, though I couldn't get it to work (and I'm a technie).  I couldn't scroll through the varietal menu without first selecting one of the grapes at the top of the alphabetical list (so to scroll to granache, you'd have to click on cabernet, and all that would come up is cabernets...).  Since we were interested in \"c\" wines, that was fine with me.  Others have commented on servers forgetting a table, bringing things out incorrectly, or simply being rude.  Other than what I listed above, and a slightly too fast pace for dinner, none of that here--everyone was professional, friendly and attentive.  And we were there on a Sunday night at 6:30.   The sommelier's recommendation for a cab franc was good, and the wine was tasty, but not out of this world.  But, I guess that's what you get for a $68 bottle of French wine at a place like this.  A few recent reviews commented on the small portions.  We found that to be just the opposite.  For a fine dining restaurant, the portions were HUGE! My wife and I could not finish our entrees and could barely get to the huge selection of sorbets.  It's not the Sizzler or an all you can eat buffet, but the portions certainly didn't leave you wanting more -- they left you wanting to clean your plate.  And, of course, the giant wine tower, with its gathering angels, was a sight to behold.  Maybe it's not the most inventive cuisine now, but Aureole does not disappoint.  4.5/5, rounded up to 5 because of the ravioli and veal.",

    "text": "Ive been staying in mandalady for the past 1.5 years, been here probably about 10 times within the last 1.5 years and never had a chance to try this restaurant since there's so many good restaurants in Manadalay, but this time I told my bf I really wanted to try this restaurant.  It's a beautiful restaurant. Sadly, I didnt get to see anyone go up for wine. My bf even suggest they let us go up for fun! Haha  At first we were a little skeptical with service. From the moment we sat, we waited a good 5 mins for our menu. My bf asked for the menu, momentarily, we saw our waiter walking past our table and then disappears for another 2 mins then he comes back with our menu! PECUILAR much?! Our Bottled water and bread came before our menu, very strange we thought!  Shortly after we ordered, this young photographer comes by and started mumbling something to us, some how we ended up taking pictures. STRANGE? i thought so! LOL she made us pose as if it's a prom picture! HILARIOUS!  They have the coolest wine menu, it's almost like an ipad, but an older version and much heavier! Their wine list is phenomenal, i mean they are the only restaurant with such huge selection of wine! It's quite impressive! My Bf didn't have wine and there wasn't any wine by glass at my interest, so i went with a cocktail. Blood orange maritini! OMG it's so weird, but so good!  I love blood orange! Oh what's weird about this drink is, it had Jalapeno!  Sounds weird Right? But it tasted like fruit punch with a little bit of spiciness. Even my bf enjoyed it!   So with Appetizers and entrees, we didnt want the prie fixe menu since we've had so many bad experience.   Appetizers  Caviar - served with little miniture pancake that tasted very much like green onion pancake, the chinese kind of course. Toppings such as egg whites, egg yolks, purple onion, cream cheese, and chives were available. mMmMm it was a party in my mouth! It was so orgasmic; im in heaven!   French onion soup - it's very tastey and rich. Bf said it's the best he ever had! One can find truffles and foie gras pieces in it :)  Seared foie gras  over toasted brioche and strawberry sorbet! Reminded me so much of the foie gras I had in palazo! AHHHH another orgasmic dish! Huge pieces of foie gras seared to perfection, unforgettable! :)   Samosa curry salad - looked like little pot stickers! The curry itself was very good, but i thought it was gonna be a real salad, and it wasnt!   Pull pork sliders - it wasn't dry, but it wasnt to my liking. Still good though better than RN74  As for entree, we had the Seared Seabass - GROSS, very dry! over cooked, we barely touched it.   Lastly, we had the warm mocha chocolate cake. It didn't taste like mocha, it tasted like a every other chocolate lava cake. It wasnt warm, it was cooled off already.  They also sent us sorbet which i enjoyed a lot. It tasted very unique and different than what I am accustomed to.  Great service, my bf and I hate waiting forever for our food, so we usually let our server know that we would like everything to be fired at once! My oh my was I impressed, Aureole is the only restaurant who brought everything out all at once in a short amount of time! The waiter also took the sea bass off of our bill! :) Great service, will definitely return for the caviar, seared foie gras, and blood orange martini :)",

Now in 2015 it was not better. Our in bone filet was ordered medium rare and came medium well. The special was fois gras, filet, spinach and was ordered medium rare and came very medium. Both were again very salty and overdone. We had the wine director pick a barolo and it was a good pick. The cheese appetizers were good but the main course was not up to the prices. They did give a waygu steak done properly but it was too little too late for us. Twice in many years is too much for me.  I can't see coming back again. We took our doggy bag and left.",

    "text": "*This is a downstairs Wine Bar review only*  The other night my wife and I had an excellent time at the bottom floor bar of Aureole in Mandalay Bay. There is also an upstairs cocktail area along the hallway inside Mandalay Bay, but we felt more like a bar experience than a people watching one.  The wine selection was EXCELLENT. I got a red flight and my wife got a white flight. The tempranillo and zinfindel in the red flight were great, and my wife said two out of her three white wines were excellent.   We also got an ahi tuna appetizer which gets an A+ for presentation and taste, but a B for quantity. They aren't huge or anything, and they come on a specialized plate designated for six pieces but instead give you four with the other two pieces on the plate garnished with avacado.   We also go the dessert sampler menu which I highly suggest for sugar-lovers out there. Everything from the Creme Brule to the Lava Cake was outstanding, and just enough for two people to share. We were going to pair the dessert with a Sautern, but the Sautern there wasn't very good, so we opted (on recommendation from the bartender) for an Ice Wine instead. The Ice Wine was AMAZING.   The service was also remarkable. It was pretty busy downstairs but the two men tending the bar were still personable and didn't rush us. We did get their fairly early in the night (about 6:30pm on a Friday), so the rush may not have come yet.  Also, another cool feature was the Cirque du Soleil-esque wine retriever. They have a four story wine rack that is great to look at and it becomes even more fun when you see a woman in a harness bouncing up and down to get the bottle you want.   All in all, this place would have been perfect if it wasn't for one thing: The prices. We got two sample flights of wine, an ahi tuna appetizer, a dessert sampler and two glasses of Ice Wine and the price came out to about $115 before the tip. I get that sometimes you are paying for experience, but I know I didn't get $115 in quality of wine.  Everything else was magnificent. I was very impressed and may go back to Aureole again, but I may only get one or two items to keep down on the cost.   Extra Note: While your there, and if you go before 9pm, walk down to the Shark Reef. It was a great experience and they do have discounts for locals. I thought it was going to be a small, crappy aquarium but it was actually pretty good sized and kept us entertained for awhile.",

We had the tasting menu, which is served in a cool way with a split plate with 2 dishes per round served in a different way.  Problem is after 5 courses I'd only say 1-2 were great and many were bland or just outright not good.  Great sommelier but the rest of the service was atrocious considering we had the biggest table (8+) in the place.   They are heaving on the foams, gelees, and technique but didn't deliver on flavor.  Keep moving, nothing to see here.",

    "text": "Another rec from the 'hounds at Chowhound. I chose this restaurant for the romance factor. The entrance is that of the \"Wine Tower\". It looks like something out of Mission Impossible, but I digress. The decor is very modern, walking in, you hear it's quite loud. Loud as in a formal dinner, not bar loud. So, I began to think, romantic? Was I steered wrong by the 'hounds at Chowhound? As we were greeted, the hostess said, two for the Swan Court, this way. That's when we were whisked into a more remote part of the restaurant. The room was darker (lit by candles on the tables) and alot quieter than the main dining rooms. We also were sat next to the French Doors that open out to the garden where Swans are joyfully swimming near by. Romance factor galore!   Food - We had the chef's tasting menu which was a seven course meal with appetizers, middle and main courses, wine, and dessert. Aureole's menu looks like it changes from time to time. I do remember it was really tasty. It came in courses (small plates), but I was surprised that I even got full (I'm a eater and can eat, so being full from small plates is a plus). The food was really, really good, but it didn't seem to be as enjoyable as Alize.   Service - Just like Alize, very attentive, not overbearing.  $235 and some with tax, tip. If you want to be romantic, choose the Swan Court as it is away from the rest of busier (louder) dining rooms.",

    "text": "We recently brought a party of 16 here to celebrate a bunch of 30th birthdays.  A few observations from that night:  Menus - fairly good range of choices.  I suppose there's something for everyone here.    Wine list - Reeedikulous!  More choices then one should be allowed to make.  Personally, I would prefer a real menu over the tablet, the software they run is slow and difficult to use.  Markup averages 3x retail.  The wine tower and fairy thing is interesting but is too industrial for my taste.  Amuse - amusing?  Somehow they forgot to even serve that.  A good sign things were going downhill from here.   Entrees - overall they were better described on the menu then executed.  I've eaten at French Laundry, Gary Denko, etc, and I wasn't expecting that here, but honestly the food wasn't - even - close.  It was extremely underwhelming.  Have a look at my photos if you don't believe me, do most of those items look appetizing?  I also suspect the kitchen was running slow, as the food wasn't as hot (temperature) as it should be.    Service - We had a large party, but if you can't serve us right then don't take the reservation.  For example:    Simple cocktails shouldn't take 10-15 minutes to make.    If we're celebrating three birthdays, make sure you bring three desserts.  Don't bring food to the table without knowing where it's supposed to go.  Asking \"who is having steak tonight?\" is acceptable at Chili's.  Not here.   Wine service, on the other hand, met expectations.    OVERALL - I expect better food AND service from a restaurant like this.",

The restaurant sits inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel which is one of the more classy of the LV Strip Hotels and the quality of the restaurant lives up to the hotels reputation.   You enter from the Casino floor but to get to the restaurant area needs an elevator ride to a lower floor. However, from the top of the elevator you get to see the Wine Tower which the restaurant is famed for. More of that later.  I went for the Christmas Menu paired with wines which came in at about $160 so this isn't cheap but you are paying for what you get which is quality food and quality service. Everything was just right with the waiters not being too intrusive but close enough so you knew exactly what was being served and what the wines were.  During the meal we had asked if the waiter could tell us when the Wine Angels would be flying and he reassured us that as we were leaving we would get to see a demo flight. The wall of wine that encompasses two floors is reached by the wine angel by hoisting her high into the sky to obtain your chosen bottle - it's a sight to be seen!  If the rest of the strip seems a little cheap and tacky then head into Aureole and experience the finest of fine dining.",

From the moment you see the wine cellar, which is obviously the centerpiece of this amazing restaurant, to your interaction with the hostess, to the walk down past all of the wine bottles, to the comfortable, relaxed ambiance of this restaurant, you get the sense that you have been transported somewhere, far away from the incessant noise of the slot machines, drunk bar patrons, and crying children that exist not 100 feet away.    The wait staff is Johnny-on-the-spot without being overly intrusive, which is sometimes a hard thing to balance.  The were all very helpful and ready with suggestions, including one that actually saved us money by telling us about an option we weren't aware of.    Naturally, we had wine. I assume you'd be tossed out and not invited back if you didn't, given the effort they put into the cellar.  The wines were marked up the typical amount for restaurants of this caliber, and we found one that we'd enjoyed before at a reasonable price (reasonable for Vegas, not for Total Wine). We watched the wine angel grab it and bring it down, which is always an interesting experience, given its uniqueness.    The steaks were easily some of the best I've had in Vegas, easily comparable with the best steakhouses I've tried, and I have visited nearly every casino's offerings.  The wife (M) and I went with friends this time, and all of us raved about this dinner for weeks afterwards.  I asked M if she wanted to hit Aureole when we go back to Vegas this month, and got an immediate \"Hell Yes!\" so I'm not sure you can get a better recommendation than that.  Thanks for a great experience, Aureole, and I can't wait to eat there again.",

    "text": "Recently partook of the chef's tasting menu and my wife and I were quite pleased.   Aureole is firing on all cylinders and had some nice changes to the menu.   Let me start by saying that the food, the wine pairings and service were all above expectations.   The tasting menu was enjoyed at a slow pace at our request so we could savor the wines and many courses.   While everything was good, there were a couple star / stand out courses - fois gras - we eat a lot of foie gras and this one was easily in our top few in terms of quality and interesting preparation and wine pairing.    The scallop was also a True stand out.   One of us enjoyed the duck and the other enjoyed the lamb.   Both are good so I would advise if you like duck (crisp outside and rare inside) go for the duck as you don't see it often...   Otherwise the lamb does not disappoint and the puree served with it really makes it pop.  The wine pairings were probably one of the top pairings we have seen done.    Candidly we are generally let down when we go out to a restaurant and order the wine pairings.  Ordering the wine pairing was definitely worth doing here!   And the pours were substantial - particularly given the 8ish courses!   Also a special shout out to our captain / server - Eric - who was very attentive, handled our food allergy issues well and was generally super knowledgable and \"Johnny on the spot\" whenever you needed anything.   The once or twice we needed something I needed only look up - as he noticed the eye contact and immediately came over to check in.",

Needless to say, go somewhere else and spend your hard earned money.",

Beautiful room accompanied with even more beautiful food. Here are my favorites:  the tomato with creamy mozzarella salad was out of this world.  I have not had tomatoes this flavorful since stopping on at a farm stand in the Hamptons in August. I seriously could eat this every day. The beef cheek ravoli with truffles was sooooo good. My husband's favorite appetizer was the bacon wrapped pork belly.  How can you go wrong with double pork? I would be remiss if I also didn't mention the carpaccio. For my entree, I had the 4x seared ribeye with sea salt, soy, mirin and uni. It was absolutely delicious. My friend has the zucchini and squash \"spaghetti\" and was blown away by the house made vegan cheese.  For dessert, my favorite had to be the Mango Sundae with goat milk ice cream and dulce de leche.  Although, I also tasted the chocolate desert with berries and sorbet .......it's hard to choose! The trio of cheesecakes was interesting - brie cheese, cheddar cheese, and bleu cheese. A ton of fun to try. Anyway, thank you Chef Church for a fun evening and wonderful food.",

    "text": "Had dinner here the other night with a business colleague.  Food was okay but not over the top.  It's a typical higher end steakhouse with pedestrian dishes, not very big portions, and served at higher price which is normal for most any and all Las Vegas Resort Casinos.    One thing we noticed is outside the restaurant entrance podium they advertise a 3 course meal for $55.00 but once you are seated inside their is no mention of this special anywhere on the menu nor do the servers mention it when being served.  When we inquired about it we got the feeling the server was not interested because of his response to us was very vague and his body language just says he wasn't interested.  It was pretty funny.  Note to Aureole management:  Take down that 3 course meal advertisement at the entrance podium if your aren't interested in selling it to your patrons once inside. It kind of comes off as a bait and switch tactic if you get my drift.  While the service was okay, the ambiance seems a little dated here (late 1990's early 2000).  The wine tower and wine angel is kind of a cool gimmick.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and makes one wonder how long they can stay in business for.  Charlie Palmer closed his South Coast California location last year and gives me the feeling that he is tired and disinterested in keeping his locations and food updated.  Sigh...",

The puff pastry was slightly underdone and was slimy. The cheese on top that was cooked to a crisp was very good though. There were 2 pieces of foie gras in it, both of which were decent, although the flavor diluted.   The octopus salad was the worst octopus I've had. It was dry and tasteless. I sent it back and received the agnolotti. This was significantly better, but the pasta was a little thick. The mushrooms were very good.   The seared foie gras was very good. I liked the huckleberry but wasn't a fan of the samosa or carrot puree.   My friend's cod was very bland, while my other friend's branzino was cooked very well and flavored nicely.   There are better dining options in Vegas, and I definitely won't be back.",

The puffed pastry lightened up the dish instead of topping the soup with unwieldy amounts of gruyere cheese. Unfortunately my steak was overcooked. I ordered medium rare and received a steak that was almost medium well. The risotto was rich and decadent.   The boyfriend had the hamachi crudo, the filet mignon, and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The \"pudding\" is a light cake and was very flavorful.   The service at Aureole was the best that we've had on this trip to Las Vegas. (You can check out my other reviews to see the other Las Vegas restaurants we visited). Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and seemed to time everything perfectly. I find it very refreshing to have someone who takes the time to listen to us rather than rushing off to the kitchen or the next table.  I should have ordered a tasting menu. The couple seated next to us had the parallel tasting menu and both of them raved about the dishes. I should have listened to THEM instead of the boyfriend who wanted an a la carte meal that evening. It's the last time I listen to him. Next time we're having the parallel tasting menu with wine pairings AND the sticky toffee pudding. ;)  As soon as I figure out how to post a picture to this review, I'll post a picture of my steak with the risotto with truffles in the background.",

The 48 oz Porterhouse (for 4) was cooked right, but arrived too cool and fairly flavorless. The roasted Brussels sprouts just ok...mine are better.  All in all, a huge disappointment and not worth the price. Had hoped for a special meal for two special occasions and got a fairly run of the mill steakhouse version.",

Very few complaints...the blue cheese crust seemed a little overdone, not nice and creamy like a few other reviewers have mentioned.  The dessert was ah-mazing.  Also sampled the creme brulee which was light and creamy.  The service was excellent.  While I enjoyed everything very much, not sure I would make it a \"must-dine\" next time I'm in Vegas.  Bonus: the wine angels that travel up and down the glorious tower of wine via a pulley system. Bogus: it was way too hot in there.  Also, crowd seemed to be mostly late 30's/early 40's professionals.  Definitely not a young, hip, trendy place.",

When it comes to service and food quality it's a step above a Chilis or Fridays. With early Thanksgiving reservation time we were one of a few tables. Took ten minutes for any service person to come to the table once seated. Once attended to, the server was friendly but distracted. Maybe some drama in the kitchen, who knows, but did affect our experience. Took another ten minutes to get our drinks, with little to no other diners. We did the prix fixe menu with me getting the traditional Turkey and my daughter opting for the filet mignon. The food was fine but not worth the $65 and $75 before sides cost. My daughter said he filet was good, and it appeared to me prepared properly. As for my Turkey and accompaniments, it was not dry but was tasteless. The sides were mediocre, and when I noted that the server removed one from the bill. Overall, underwhelming and too expensive.",

This the perfect spot.  Don't get me wrong.  This is a very nice restaurant with a well trained wait staff.  However, I'm traveling with my family in tow and my nicest outfit is some jeans and a polo.  Still, they treat everyone like royalty.  So for the food, the wife and I did the parallel tasting menu.  The little one had the filet and some dessert.  I really liked the tasting menu.  It was very modern American - classic with hints of European accents and delicious.  And for $85 a head, you're actually getting 8 courses.  I was honestly very satisfied at the end of the meal.  The wife and I shared a wine pairing (along with a few cocktails).  The sommelier was kind enough to split the pairing into separate glasses and pretty much gave us a full pour each.  The service was top notch from all aspects.  The wine angel made special trips up the tower just to entertain our little one.  I would definitely return here when I venture out of my cave again.",

The food was amazing and the staff treated us with a fabulous mix of warm and inviting as well as professional and elegant.  The three of us had a variety of dishes and we were hard pressed to choose a favorite! I had brought two guests with me both of whom have been in the elite restaurant business in NY for many years.  They were beyond  impressed.  The treatment we received at Aureole made me look brilliant for choosing this restaurant. I cannot compliment the managers of this restaurant enough.  Paige and Chelsea are both very accomplished and Aureole is smart to have these two professionals as the face of their company.  They obviously do a wonderful job in hiring and training their people as the atmosphere of impeccable service is a constant throughout the restaurant. I have promised myself that my next trip to Las Vegas will have stops at Aureole as the centerpiece of my trip.  Thanks again to this great place for a highlight to my trip!",

This was especially bad given that that the restaurant was maybe 40% full on a Saturday at 7:00 pm and had a plethora of staff.   We weren't greeted when we got to the downstairs host/hostess stand for several minutes along with two other groups. Finally a lady came, asked our name, and told us to sit and wait on the sofa. Weird. We were seated shortly thereafter but what an odd combo to be greeted at a stand upstairs and give your name, wait, do the same downstairs, wait, get seated.   Our server, Fernando, was very helpful and as attentive as possible. His supporting team was lacking. They cleared our starter and utensils and forgot to replenish. The two servers bringing the entrees didn't see we had no utensils. The manager would walk by the side of the dining room but not make eye contact or scan the room. I finally got up and asked if we could get utensils. Not acceptable for a $250 meal for two.   The food? Meh. The carpaccio was creative but lacked zip. The frito misto was not impressive and had maybe a teaspoon of avocado puree under a huge pile of fried veggies. The crab roll lacked acidity and balance. While I hate the old restaurant trend of over salting to make up for mediocre flavor, all the dishes here tasted notably under salted. When there's little acidity, heat, or rounding of flavor, the low salt really stands out.   There are many better options for great food and service...",

My husband and I are traveling with our 2 teenage sons. Upon looking at the menu our kids were a little out of their comfort range... but that all changed with their first bite. Their wine list is extensive and our server very knowledgeable about the wine list. We had an excellent meal with excellent service! You will spend some serious cash but will walk away satisfied! Bon Appetite",

The vegetable were very nicely cooked. It came with so much polenta...but was very tastely. Our salads were also good. Especially my husband's who had the beet salad. We loved our experience there and would say it's a great place to come especially when you watch the wine seeker climb the tower for bottles.",

    "text": "Dined here a couple of nights ago. Was in town for a conference and restaurant was recommended. We had a 915 reservation. Of course when you have a wine collection as expansive as this one it is quite the spectacle. The decor and ambiance is very nice as well. But for me, that is where the fine dining experience stopped.   The entire night was thrown off starting with before dinner cocktails. The table ordered two manhattans that came and were so far from manhattans they could have been called San Diego's. I make a very good Manhattan and have no issue 1) telling you what's wrong with yours and 2) how to make it the right way. I asked the waiter to ask the bartender what they did because it was so far off and the answer was far from what I tasted the difference was. At any point they did not charge us for the drink that I would not take more than half a sip from and then made a much closer to regular Manhattan that clearly showed the first drink was made without focus. Although, the second was closer, it was weak and so small it was ridiculous.   The restaurant mgr (at least I think that's who he was) came to take our order. He was wearing a suit where our waiter wore a vest and tie I believe, was in my opinion rude. He rushed our appetizer order. Rushed our food order and at no point was capable of providing a pleasant experience.  For example, there were four people in our party and his recommendation for an appetizer was three small ravioli. Which our waiter told us would not be good for us and provided another suggestion which we had him change to.   Our waiter was nice, although his knowledge of the menu was questionable. He made good recommendations but when we asked what the side car dish was with the steak his answer was \"the chef changes it every couple days, I don't know\". You would think at some point he would ask the chef and answer the question.   Honestly I could go on and on about the food and how mediocre it was. I ordered the bone in rib eye. Don't hate me but I like my steak medium well plus. The waiter said he would order it well but the chef would not dry it out. Well, it was very dry. It was served on these steel type plates/trays. Which was cool BUT. A cold steel tray will make a cold ass steak. A cold ass steak becomes a dry ass steak (and I'm not trying to say aged). We ordered roasted Brussel sprouts that ended up being steamed Brussel sprouts. The mushrooms were meh. I would send a picture of my steak but it wasn't picture worthy. I did take a picture of my friends chicken stuffed with crab. But you'll see there's no chicken and it wasn't finished. The other two dishes were rib eye medium rare which the person loved and the osso bucco which was tender.   The desserts were okay but not my speed.   I can sum this up best by saying a picture is worth a thousand words. If you look at the pictures from years ago in yelp from this place and anything recent. I feel you will see a drastic difference. Before the food was inspired, now the food is uninspired and tired. Maybe it's time for a change.  Anyone can have a huge wine collection in the Mandalay bay to get people in. But in 2016 in Las Vegas there are too many great experiences for dining to be had to perform the way this place is currently performing. If it wasn't for the ambience and the wine tower (which in this day and age the wine angel thing is played out, it should be automated if you ask me) I would've given it a one. That would be based on food, presentation, service and professionalism.",

The wine angel (think silver full-body latex acrobat \"flying\" to bring your wine down from the glass-enclosed wine cage) provided a good distraction from the lack-luster service our waiter provided. The menu offers equal parts appetizers and meals and the portions are excellent so you could choose an appetizer for your main course if you aren't starving.  There are plenty of options for vegetarians but it's not easy to find anything if you are gluten-free.",

The mash potatoes were smooth and perfectly prepared comfort food. The weak dish was the Caesar salad. Limp and tasteless unfortunately. We didn't order any wine.

    "text": "This spot seems kind of insecure about itself --- like it is trying so hard to do everything right and look beautiful when in fact they are just fine without the try-hard.  This is a unique venue with its hallmark multi story wine vault that requires a bungee cord system that vaults a person up in the air to pick out a bottle of wine. Very gimmicky, but entertaining.  The setting is initially very impressive, but it gets somewhat odd upon further inspection as you can kind of see a hotel employee entrance on the bottom level (not hidden too well).  The food and service is what you would expect given the prices. It's tasty and quite good, but price is definitely on the high end even for fine dining. I had a filet, duck fat fries, and a salad --- and all were tasty. They didn't leave me floored though, and I kind of wish the duck fat fries were more crispy (they are extremely thick which makes it difficult to crisp).  If this was my money being used (thank you generous company account), i'm not sure I'd go here over a craftsteak or a Joe's Stone crab or the like. But if you're in Mandalay Bay and want chic dining and don't mind paying a ton, this spot will do.",

My husband and I had the cheese platter for an appetizer which was very good. For the main coarse I had the Lamb chops which were completely tasteless and the potatoes/pea puree accompanying were bland. I order lamb chops everywhere I go and this was by far was the most tasteless meal so far. My husband had the seafood pasta- 6 clams 1 shrimp and a couple mussels. For the money you pay (approx 50 dollars a dish) you should get more then 1 shrimp. We also ordered a cauliflower and lentils side. It should just be called lentils because we got two pieces of cauliflower. I am really disappointed.  Last- ask for seating near the wine tower. We were sat in the back and did not get to see someone go up to get wine once : ( which was part of why we went there.",

    "text": "We made reservations for our anniversary dinner through the hotel concierge. We anticipated a great dinner experience with great food and service. We were wrong. When we checked in upon arriving, the hostess told us that it will be about a 5-10 minute wait. Convention people were in the hotel and so it was a reasonable request. Well the time passed and so I was going to inquire as to the hold up. When I was about to, they gave us an indication that our table may be ready and we were finally going to be seated. Unfortunately they told us to wait longer as there was no table because of the convention. Well, one would assume that restaurants in Vegas would be aware of conventions and anticipate the amount and rush of people each night and manage accordingly, especially one as highly regarded as this restaurant. Again, we were wrong to believe it.   We saw people being seated before us and they arrived after we checked in for our reservation. I was livid and told their hosts in certain terms that they ruined our special night and we were just going to leave. Another staff member intervened (didn't know if she was the manager because she never said her name nor told us who she was) proceeded to explain that they don't have a table available because of the circumstances. Their excuse made it worse because why set the reservation if they couldn't accommodate and we specifically said in setting this dinner reservation that it was for our anniversary. We could have chosen other fine dining establishments but we chose this restaurant based on the accolades and high ratings. Again we were proven wrong. Finally when we made a decision to just leave, they somehow found another table. BTW the table we requested should have been in the Swan room but we didn't get it. We should have left because further lame attempts and excuses should have warned us.  Well the appetizers we ordered, the glasses of wines, and my main dish were good, however my wife's main entree was not. After being seated and after the 40 minute fiasco, one would think that we will now be given a good experience - once again, we were proven wrong. Overall the service was spotty and the experience left a bad taste and bad memory. Based on our terrible experience and the monies we shelled out to pay for this dinner - be forewarned. I should not give them any star or if I have to, it will be a half-star.",

The food, from passed hors d'ouevres to the AMAZING French onion soup, steak and desserts was fantastic.   I would not hesitate to plan another event at Aureole.

We ordered the double rib eye steak special and the caprese salad special and soft drinks. No alcohol for the pregnant lady!   The caprese was delish-delicate, seasoned well and very light (melted in your mouth) $20 The steak came out carved, sliced, juicy and ready to eat! Three sauces accompanied the huge steak that wasn't two steaks but was just one huge slab of meat. It was really rare for medium well but too bad, better to be rare than burnt so we enjoyed anyway. $140 Side dishes were: potato puree-awesome and yummy and very buttery but delicious $12 Parmigiana French fries-kinda cold, kinda greasy, kinda heavy. Didn't care for them. $11  Service was good. Malik was our waiter and he was friendly and helpful and described everything. My only complaint is that we had servers and bussers watching our every move but every time our glasses were empty we had to actually ask for refills. We shouldn't have had to ask for anything when the place was empty and three or four people didn't take their eyes off of us. When drinks are almost empty, please get the refills ready!",

The service was average and the food was even more average.  Our total bill was $500.  A complete and utter rip off.  Do not eat at this restaurant; it's completely not worth what you pay for.",

    "text": "For no particular reason we wanted to have a nice/fancy dinner during the time I was there and decided to try Aureole since it had been on my list for a long time and was also just next door to where we were staying. It's most recognizable feature is the two story wine tower that is the feature of the entrance way. If you're lucky you'll see one of the servers gliding up and down fetching wines ordered for tables down below (pretty sure out bottle was not one of them). The space is nice and elegant and even smaller than I expected. We were seated at a nice semi circle table with very high backs as to give the sense you're in your own space. I really liked the format of the menu - everything was prix fixe with lots of choices. We each selected a starter, a main course and two sides to share, as well as two desserts. It's a lot of food, well priced and amble choice. The service was top notch and we even selected our bottle of wine from an old school looking tablet (probably one of the first places to use?). At the end of the day we had a very nice meal but my biggest gripe is that the flavors over all were not outstanding or unique. There were a few bites here and there that were great, but if you took away everything else that made it \"vegas\", it would be a pretty ordinary food experience. I would recommend it for a safe bet for a good time with reliable food everyone can enjoy, the special vegas experience, and all at a good value and service. I would not go for an exquisite foodie experience or something extraordinarily different. A nice option to have the quiver.  They started us with an amuse bouche of three little bites: grilled cheese thing, egg roll and small piece of meat on a stick (I really don't remember the details). Our first course consisted of a yellow fin tuna poke composition and burrata and copa salad. The tuna was nice but hard to compare to the Poke we ate in Hawaii. I liked Erica's burrata salad more than she did because it had a nice kick with the bloody mary granite sauce. We both went with steaks for dinner - mine a NY strip loin with Peruvian smashed potatoes and chimichurri sauce, and Erica had the blue cheese crusted filet. The steaks were cooked well and nicely seasoned, particularly my strip with the exotic flavors of south america. I preferred Erica's more traditional filet preparation and certainly did not need my entire portion. Our sides were garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The potatoes were very creamy, garlicy and tasty but I wished more of those characteristics were found in the spinach. Finally for dessert we each ordered a sampler option with many little tasty treats. Aureole is a fun Vegas dinner that doesn't make or break any rules. Standard food with a great experience at a good value - can't go wrong for a special night out.",

    "text": "I found myself hungry tonight at Mandalay Bay after seeing a band play at House of Blues (Cursive, they were great, thanks for asking).  I had a $50 gift certificate in my car for Aureole (from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, it cost me $2), so my girlfriend and I went there for dinner.  The reviews on Yelp weren't _too_ great, so I wasn't super excited, but I came way from dinner very pleased.  The restaurant setting is great, even though the wine angels weren't working.  Service was really good... our waters were never empty, the bread guy came around twice to give us more pretzel bread, etc.  I had the swordfish and my girlfriend had the sea bass.  We enjoyed her dish a little more, but both were unique offerings and were pretty good.  We're not big eaters, so the two main courses were plenty to get us stuffed, but they had a big dessert menu we really, really wanted to order from.  Bonus points to the sommelier for taking care of us.  We inquired why there wasn't a wine flight like on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> menu, and he told me they don't do that anymore since nobody ordered it.  But he offered to put one together for us.  When I told him that was OK, he ended up letting us sample a white wine he recommended, and he didn't charge us for it.  Needless to say I left a generous tip.  Our entire bill after the GC and tax, but before gratuity, was $17.02.  Not bad for a restaurant of this caliber.",

I was so taken away by all the great things that night that I've had a hard time describing it, and even now would I not be able to truly explain my experience. I will say this: both my and my date's plates were left clean, without a single piece of food left. Every glass of wine was beautifully paired up with each course. All was cooked to perfection, and the grape sorbet was so amazing I nearly cried. The atmosphere was intimate and they even had live music. All the people that served me, including the woman at the reservations desk were genuine, helpful, and eager to please. We even had the opportunity to see the chef in person, as he visited the adjacent table. I know this is not my strongest review, and perhaps I will update next time I visit, but it was truly the highlight of my trip.",

    "text": "The first time hubby and I ate here we did the full tasting menu and had I written a review at that time, I would have easily given it five stars. Each dish was so unique, beautifully presented and tasty beyond belief.   On our most recent trip to Vegas we wanted to eat at as many great places as possible. I love to plan out all my culinary stops and make reservations weeks before.  On this particular night we were seeing the AFI show (my favorite punk rock turned slightly sell out band) so we had some issues with time. Besides Aureole having the earliest opening time, they were conveniently located near the House of Blues (AFI) at Mandalay.  So, in hopes of another fabulous meal...  This time hubby and I ordered a la carte (time constraints). We shared a couple of tapas style small bites and then ordered entrees. We skipped dessert. Everything was very good but nothing was as stand out as the tasting menu enjoyed prior to this visit. Everything was still far better than our dinner the prior evening at Michael Mina (hubby will disagree with me there).   Aureole's wine list is excellent. It could take you half the evening to make a selection if you didn't know what you were looking for or didn't ask for help. The service is really good. The restaurant itself is beautiful. With the wine cellar as the focal point, the main dining area is wide open with high ceilings. The decor is contemporary but the lighting is dim and very romantic.  I wish they had more bathrooms (they have a one-person ladies room) without having to leave the restaurant itself.   My only real complaint echoes a fellow yelper's review. I think having a photographer make the rounds and take pictures of guests is kind of uncool, unclassy and commercial feeling. I felt interrupted and obliged to have my picture taken. The results I would liken to a slightly fuzzy prom picture.  It brought the ambiance of the place down and maybe if enough people yelp about it management will put an end to it.   In all, a good evening. We will be back in the future but without a doubt we will take the time to do the tasting menu.",

Unfortunately that all crumbled from the minute we arrived to getting our check- when the server was practically telling us to leave.   It took awhile for them to decide who would be our server, we picked a wine from their electronic tablet and it still took awhile for the wine to arrive. They didn't give us menus for at least 10-15 minutes after we sat waiting. Meal happened, not much to talk about there. After all the rudeness and check delivered, we were charged for dessert after several servers advised it was part of the prix fix menu. We didn't even want dessert and then they tried to charge us for it. It was really strange. Last, we needed to split our bill and had 3 cards- for their convenience we wrote down each amount for each card, making it easy as pie.  But then the great check debacle happened and they decided no- we're going to do it our way and split it evenly 3 ways leaving our one friend being charged double what she should have paid.  I've never experienced such poor service and I feel bad for giving such a bad review, but I want other visitors to this restaurant to be forewarned. The food did not make up for it.   The only thing we enjoyed was the wine and we picked that our ourselves.",

It's just an overpriced poser of a restaurant catering to small town tourists who wouldn't know good food if it bit them on the neck.  And it says it has a one star Mechelin review?  It does NOT deserve it.  Most of the service was fairly good, but the Sommelier was a standoffish snob.  Once I showed him I knew a lot about wine (I'm a Somm myself), he gave me several tastes so I could select a wine that paired well with my meal, but his constant eye rolling and side-handed smirks really detracted from the service and cast a cloud over the overall experience.  The food was overcooked, soggy, not fresh, underwhelming, under-flavored, and flaccid.  In summary, overpriced, underwhelming, and not worth your time, your money, and definitely not a Michelin star.",

The fois gras was good but the mish mash of ingredients of every national origin all mixed in around it was overwhelming.  I would prefer a simple well seared, well seasoned fois with nice toasts.  The tuna/scallops over kimchee???? And with the red chili sauce I buy at Ralph's, a bit lazy.  I expect more at this level of gastronomy.  The tuna was undercooked but scallops were perfectly seared.  So if you like kimchee and sweet sauce, otherwise not my favorite preparation.  Just seems like they put too many ingredients that don't go together on one plate.   Chocolate trio desert was insane.  Definitely my favorite part.

It was nice that they allowed me to get the tasting course and not force it upon my wife since the menu makes it out to be that way. I appreciated their flexibility with it.  I loved every course that came out for my paired tasting course. Each side of the plate of a contrast of flavor yet worked perfectly together.  I was hoping to see more action in the wine vault, but other than that the amibiance of the restaurant was light.

    "text": "Whoa, what a cool wine tower. unfortunately, I sat in the swan room, and did not get a chance to witness the wine fairy doing their thing. Make a note to not sit in the swan room next time.  I made reservations for 2 at 9.30 on Saturday. They close their kitchen at 10.30. The Server pulled out my chair and and put on my napkin. Good signs.  I opted for the 4-course 8 dishes, $95 parallel prix fixe menu, and my bf got the $85 3-course. spring pea and ricotta ravioli for appetiser, grilled N.Y. strip loin with a side of rustic smashed potato.  My dungeness crab and ahi tuna mille feauille was was delectable, perfectly accompanied by the coconut kefir lime froth. It was a refreshing cold dish, layered with avocado. The crab was definitely very fresh.  The parallel was the seared dungeness grab cake, bedded with papaya. It was bursting with flavours, and as a hater of red pepper? I devoured it all.  Second course came the olive oil poached wild king salmon. one of the most tender salmon i've had, with a hint of citrus that accompanied the fish very nicely.  the parallel was the house made salmon angelotti in tomato dressing. The Angelotti was very al dente, I wasn't that big of a fan of this dish. it was slightly bland for my taste. I think the salmon was overpowered by the angelotti.  Next up came the Wagyu beef strip loin bedded with an abalone mushroom. The beef was very tender, the meat was full of original flavour. i did not like the abalone mushroom, the mushroom taste was overwhelming! i am normally a fan of mushroom too.  The parallel was the sea diver scallop surrounded by gnocci, morel mushroom and fava beans. O.M.G. the best scallop i've ever had. the freshness oozed out of every bite i tried to savour. It was cooked to perfection. The Gnocci was a little bland. The beans and mushroom completed the dish.  My boyfriend's spring pea and ricotta ravioli was delicious. al dente and i quote \"the best ravioli i've ever had\" For spring pea, it was full of flavour and scrumptious. His NY strip loin was pretty good, but not the best. it was still slightly hard in medium rare. it was huge though!  Dessert was the cherry on top. My BF was stuffed and didn't want any dessert, but they still gave us a plate of 6 assorted sorbets on the house! one or two of them was a little sour, but everything else was very fruity that flawlessly melts in your mouth.  I was stuffed at this point. I finished the lemon mascarpone semifreddo, that had whole blueberries inside, YUM! Everything was melt in your mouth delicious! However, i didn't manage to finish the blueberry meyer lemon financier as I was too full. I had a couple bites and it was just too filling for me. it tasted like cake but denser, still very good. Maybe I should've packed it!  The blueberry lemon verbena sorbet was too sour for my liking.   As we exited, rows and echoes of goodbyes and thank yous was said to us from all the servers around, including those that didn't serve us. What a way to end a special night!  Tip: Tasting menu is the way to go! only $10 more anyways! you will get full! Don't eat too much bread because you can get full from your 8 course!  Favourites: fresh, delicious and delicately cooked. great service  Do not want: pricey i guess? not too much. lack of choices  Last words: A perfect dining experience!",

It was, after all, a one Michelin star recipient. What went wrong?   Well, for the most part although my meal didn't taste bad, it didn't taste particularly great. It wasn't fantastic. For the prices, it was only alright and not something I'd pay for next time. Most of their dishes were un-inspired and lacked the glistening luster of a one Michelin star place. The service was too casual to be consistent in my book and what kind of decent restaurant like this as DRY limes?   They also don't ask you before re-filling your sparkling water, what if I didn't want to pay for another bottle?  The only dish that saved this meal from a complete lackluster of goodness was their daily inspirational preparation of foie gras. It was truly delicious with the sweet pudding bread that they paired it with. My chicken liver pate was almost tasteless which was very unexpected of pate, and my salmon dish was overcooked, dry and lacked any salmon flavor whatsoever. I even offered it to the rest of the table to share and they all agreed that it didn't taste like salmon at all. Their black cod was alright but then again ... cod as a fish is delicious and difficult to mess up to begin with. I was especially disappointed that although they had a fantastic wine selection that some top names other restaurants had were non-existent in their vast towering cellar of wines. What's the point if you're just going to stock it with 100 bottles of the same wine with no room for others?  Overall, it wasn't worth the money and I don't see how it was worth the Michelin star.",

The ipad want to be tablet that they use for their wine list is ridiculously lame, totally doesn't work and only succeeded in pissing us off from the moment we sat down. It really set the tone for the evening but things did improve.  Service was also off which did not help the situation.    Things got significantly better when the food came.  Neither one of us was interested in the options on the prix fix so went with apps and entrees.  The seared ahi was really good and I would definitely get it again.  I also tried the sea bass which was excellent as well.    Overall I might go back as the food was quite good, but given the numbers of restaurants in Vegas I would be more likely to go elsewhere.",

It is no wonder why, with every one of my visits to Las Vegas, NV, I make it a point to visit Aureole.   Mr. Mainini's staff didn't just make sure we had a great dinner, they were constantly (in a kind, professional - not overbearing manner) making sure that an experience was taking place.   I've visited this establishment for business and pleasure dining and each time, my expectations have been met and exceeded.  The staff's timing between courses, the freedom and comfort of quietly checking in without interrupting conversation, the artistic presentation of the chef's delicious preparations will not only impress, but will keep you looking forward to more.  Here's a neat tip: ask for a tour of the establishment. The staff will be elated to walk you through. There are some neat facts to learn about the place hat you'll remember. It was nicely and thoughtfully designed and knowing the details will give you a greater appreciation for what goes on behind the scenes.  Dinner with swans? The swan lake feature is regal and relaxing. Step outside with your drink and take it in between courses. Look up to the top left of that area at night to see the brilliant MANDALAY BAY moniker on the building's edge. It's a pretty sight adding to the experience.  Even the details inside the elevator (the decor)... you won't pay much attention to it on he way in. When departing, after you've slowed the Las Vegas adrenaline pace with a pleasurable experience at Aureole, you will literally stop  & \"smell the rose\" that is on display.   Aureole is a must have experience. Try it and you will be back when you stroll into Vegas next time.",

We chose dinner at Aureole on a Tuesday night, in the wintertime/off season which turned out to be a pretty great night.   From the minute we walked in the doors to the moment we left, we were stunned and impressed by the wine tower, food and exceptional service.   We probably had two or more servers throughout the night and a couple of visits from the sommelier. We bought a bottle of wine, but it was only OK. Fortunately, the sommelier had mentioned a much better Pinot Noir, which he kindly poured for us instead! We ended up doing a wine pairing with our three course prix fixe meal, as there are so many excellent wine choices, and they are more than happy to introduce you to the perfect wine for your taste and meal.   The meals were so delicious and beautifully created. I don't know if it was just because it was my birthday, but the desserts were my favorite part. I wanted every last bite. The selection of assorted sorbets are incredible! I don't believe I've ever tasted such unique flavors.   I have posted a few pictures for your pleasure of my monstrous Arugula and Frisee Salad with Duck Confit, Sea Bass, and the yummy deserts!",

The first course and wine selection was actually ok. Not great, but not bad either. It was funny watching the wait staff playing with wine list on the iPad. And the bread was tasty.   Then, the main course happened. Everything arrived cold. The medium steak, the potatoes, the pasta, the cooked purple kale. Cold cold cold. I guess the reason the food took so long was they were waiting for everything to cool off. They offered to microwave everything for us, but that didn't seem right.   So if you have to come here, just order small plates like cheese or soup and NOT the main entrees.",

In general, the food is very good. I did the pre-fixe menu the 1st visit, and it was a while ago, so I don't remember what I had, but I remember liking it enough to come back. At that time, the server even brought me some extra goodies for free, so that was nice.   They are also on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, so you can get a pretty good discount here. On my recent visit, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with duck confit. This was a very nice mix of flavors. The foie gras was also good, but I actually had better foie gras the night before at Stripsteak next door.  The cheese plate was good. I also had the salmon, which was good but not great. I definitely enjoyed the pre fixe menu I ordered on my 1st visit better than the choices I made on my most recent visit. So the take home message here is not to trust myself to know how to order properly :)    Also, they bring an assortment of four breads at the beginning (including pretzel bread), but they are all served cold, which is not pleasing. Who likes cold bread better than warm bread? Plus, they seem very excited about their wine list and the \"wine angels\" on harnesses who go get your wines for you. I have a better idea... why not charge admission and strap the guest into the harness and he/she can go get his/her own wine. Dinner and a ride!   I want to give them 3 stars for the most recent visit, but 4 stars for the initial visit. I guess I rounded up. The overall average rating of 3.5 stars is very accurate.",

Forget the buffets, forget the meal coupons- If you're looking to really class up your Las Vegas experience then look no further. This is 5 star dining at it's best- a beautiful, one of a kind restaurant. Know for their famous 'Wine Tower', Aureole has AAA Four Diamond awards and Michelin Stars all over the place.  This was my first time at a Charlie Palmer restaurant, and it lived up to the expectations. The flavor in the food was as delicate and unique as you would expect. Flavors that open your palette to new things, tastes you've never experienced before.   My tip- go before the Lion King show. They have a 'happy hour' with half off small plates until 7pm. I recommend the Lobster Corn Dog- the only way to describe it; droolworthy.",

I had pre read some yelp reviews and heard that the halibut was only so so, so the entree choice was easy. for the first course, my dad and i ordered one of each. i really liked both, but if you don't like cold soup - opt for the salad!   the hanger steak was amazing. i'm not usually a fan of sauces or seasoning on my steak, but this steak's flavors were really perfect - spicy & rich, but not heavy - it complemented the steaks natural flavors really well. add a sip of the grenache which was spicy with a touch of sweetness and it was a 'remy' moment. i can still taste it and i had it over 6 months ago...  for desserts - our server pretty much made it clear that the banana fosters tiramisu was the way to go, and it WAS. my dad ate the dessert in a blink, and started to eye mine!  All in all, was totally worth the experience & the $200+ bill after, but i had to dock a point off for the fact that the halibut and dark spearmint dessert (characterized as a big andes bar by sister who was at the other table) were only ok. for me - a restaurant of this caliber should have ALL excellent choices on a prix fix, and it was pretty obvious that wasn't the case.   PS - bread selections were also amazing! and yes - the wine tower was amazing as well (but there are already plenty of posts on that!)",

    "text": "I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty horrified by the experience I just had at Aureole.  I've been there for happy hour and it is fantastic.  Two for one small plates, wine and cocktails are pretty amazing.  And those sirloin sliders are unbelievable (the two stars are for those...and the happy hour).  But I have to say, the dinner experience was just weird and offensive.  To start, I walked in and spoke to the host stand to let them know that our party would have one more for dinner.  It was then told that they did not have my reservation.  That was strange, I'd booked with Open Table and had mysteriously already received the points.  Turns out they found my reservation and told me that my party was already seated.  I guess I looked at them funny and they pointed at the table.  Turns out \"I\" was sitting with four people I had never seen before.  So they gave my table away.  No big deal, they weren't that busy, but it was weird that they argued with me that I'd already been seated when I was standing in front of them.  So they said they'd prepare another table while we waited patiently in the bar.  After 30 minutes, no one came to get us so we checked in again...and finally got our table.  You know it's a bad sign when the first thing out of your server's mouth is a giant sigh.  Then he said, \"cocktails, wine?\"  No greeting, no smile, no nothing.  We asked for the wine list and he stared blankly at us.  We replied that we had no menus but that didn't seem to matter either.  So much for that Wine Spectator award.  They have a lot of great wines but you wouldn't know it, the servers have no clue about them or no desire to talk about them.  After being pressured into ordering beverages, we finally got menus.  The menus are pretty simple and don't go into a lot of detail.  When the server came back he asked if we would like for him to talk about the menu.  We said yes and he proceeded to explain that they had a tasting menu and an a la carte.  And that was it.  When we asked for suggestions, he muttered something about being really busy.  Then he asked where we were from in a condescending tone.  Ummm...really?  WTF difference does it make?!  You'd think we'd walked in with fanny packs covered in condoms and suckers from a bachelorette party.    After answering no questions, another server came by and asked if we were ready.  When we asked him to talk about the menu, he went into the same spiel about there being a tasting menu and an a la carte.  Yes, we can read, but what about the things ON the menu???  They kept asking if we were ready but wouldn't answer any questions.  At that point, the bread guy was looking like he'd be a more promising server.  It was seriously like pulling teeth.  One even made a snide remark while walking away.  Most places love to talk about the menu, not this place.  I'd reached a point where I really wanted to walk out.  I'm in Vegas for business quite a bit more than I'd like and I know that almost anywhere else would provide better service.  My friends ultimately decided we would stay and we placed our orders.  Long story short-er, my octopus and hearts of palm salad had two slivers of hearts of palm and fishy, chewy octopus (I actually asked my friends what was supposed to come with the octopus because I could not remember and the only other main ingredients on the plate were cherry tomatoes & fingerling potatoes.  What is with this place and fingerling potatoes anyway?  They're in everything, but anyway).  My veal loin was overcooked despite my ordering it prepared as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm.  The only good part of the meal is that this place seems to always send over comp desserts.  I know everyone's so amazed by the wine angels, but I would have had a better experience watching the rock climbing wall at the gym.  I now hate this place.  We were treated like an inconvenience rather than valued guests.  I miss Fleur de Lys, I really hope they reopen it.  If they don't and you absolutely must go to this place, only go for happy hour, otherwise you will end up leaving pissed and sorry you wasted your time.",

    "text": "This was going to be the splurge of our girls trip to Las Vegas but it wound up being more of a bust. I love to read/research/pick out restaurants and we chose Aureole because we wanted to try the pre-fixe menu and we both liked the various choices. We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation so we spent some time shopping. We arrived at the restaurant promptly and were taken to our table but the hostess didn't ask to take our coats (it was windy that night) or our bag. Once we arrived, we were seated at one of the banquettes and I put my purse next to me along with my coat. The waiter came over and picked up my friends things and put them on the other side of me - totally made me feel hemmed in. Again, I should have asked for coat check but he should have as well. I had the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon and let the server know we were using it as well as ordering from the theater menu and that we'd like glasses of wine (I like whites, my friend likes reds). That pretty much ended our service from him and his assistant. They took our order but after that, a waiter from a different section took care of us until the time when the bill was presented. We never got the chance to look at the electronic wine menu and our meals were just so-so. They were adequate but nothing spectacular. I've eaten in restaurants with better reputations where they actually make you feel like you more welcome. Maybe it was the waiter, maybe it was the restaurant, maybe it was me, but I know I'll never go back to Aureole.  Utterly disappointing culinary end to a great vacation!",

This may not be an appropriate way to begin a review for a nice restaurant, but then again Aureole is not a nice restaurant.  The service was about as bad as possible.  From the sneaky upsell to the \"Swan Room\" to the short and non-descriptive descriptions of each course by our waiter to the mind-numbing half hour wait between each of the seven courses, I really cannot decide what was the worst.  Actually, I will tell you what was the worst, that the food was mediocre, for an old person's palate, and made up entirely of low-cost ingredients.  As ridiculous as the entire experience was, I tried to bite my tongue so the birthday people could try to enjoy their night.  But at the end of four hours (we were told the tasting menu would take 2 1/2 hours.  Did I mention there were only seven other groups in the entire restaurant on a Friday night?) We gladly paid the 160-200 each person and got the hell out of there, all of us laughing hysterically that a Restaurant could be so hyped, so over-priced, and so horribly awful.  Well, at least we had a sense of humor about it.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to venture out of the Hard Rock Hotel for dinner and headed to Mandalay Bay's 'Aureole'. I had little knowledge of the restaurant, it's cuisine, layout, etc... except that it sat across from the China Grill and that it housed a multi-story wine cage/vault... (basically a large glass encased storage tower you might imagine would hold... government secrets, DNA, or some kind of supercomputer... in a James Bond/Austin Powers/Mission Impossible kind of scenario--- but in this case, it was wine.) We traversed down a seemingly endless set of stairs that wrapped around the cage and arrived at the bottom to be greeted by the host. She offered us seating in either the main floor or the Swan Court. We chose the Swan Court. It was much quieter, more intimate. We sat by a set of double-pane glass doors that looked out onto our own private patio area overlooking a small Swan-filled pond. The interior decor throughout was very simple, but modern-  lots of earthtones, glass, clean-lines and height. We were then handed a PC tablet listing their wine selection (impressive), by servers dressed in full suit & tie attire (odd). Combine the decor with the technology and the server attire, and you can see why it felt as though we were in GATTACA (and feeling slightly underdressed). Nonetheless, the servers were extremely attentive, professional and knowledgable about every aspect of the dining experience... So far we've gone from 2 choices (main room or the Swan Court) to 10,000 choices (wine) back to 2 choices... either the 7-course Chef's selection or a 2 course pre-fixe menu... we chose the 7-course to taste a bit of everything, even after being warned it might take as long as 2 hours to get through the meal. Three hours (and several $$$$$) later, I found myself pleased with the whole experience and highly recommend it for a special occassion or after winning big at the tables.",

Really, can't get too many more checks in my book. Aurole was amazing. The three course tasting menu was both intriguing and inventive in its choices and the food came out with impeccable service and great conversation to add to it. The wine list was really cool to peruse through, clicking on options to see their available wines. We definitely spent some time playing around before we selected our choice for the evening. We were able to watch one of the girls climb up to get our wine, which happened to be at the very top. The whole experience was great and I would recommend Aurole to anyone looking for a great dining experience. This place isn't just about the food, it's about walking away with some great memories of a great restaurant.",

Take a break from gambling in Las Vegas and invest in a food experience of a lifetime! This is an adventure complete with wine pairings and world class table service! ( I have been amazed when sitting with a group of 10 that our courses arrive exactly together and love the personal touches if it has been a Birthday or special event such as a box of chocolates at the end of the meal.). The sommelier is a wonderful luxury! Don't be afraid to ask for a particular color, flavor or even price-point... they are very helpful and friendly! The food is incredible... beautiful works of art that melt in your mouth... each dish well thought out, balanced and presented... Be daring, go for the foie gras as you can be assured it will be done right and taste delicious! A food lovers dream come True... Thank you Aureole! : )",

    "text": "I went to Las Vegas for a best friend from high school's 21st. The problem is our alway opposite side of the spectrum taste finally took form when I went to San Francisco and she went to Chico. When I realized her birthday dream was going to be about grabbing a slice and walking around New York New York marvelling about how it was sort of like the real thing. I took off and decided to live it up for her. One of the places I found myself was at Aureole's lower bar. Three really handsome men approached me and asked if they could buy me a drink. \"Each?\" And before I thanked my lucky stars I tried to explain to them I wasn't in the service industry, because they might have had the wrong idea. By the time I finished that song and dance in a way as to not cause embarassment for any of us, their table was ready. And they asked if instead of a drink, I could join them for dinner. \"Why not?\" The food was incredible. Those three were there for a bachelor party, figuring why not just keep the group small and go really big. I became a mascot. They ordered every dessert on the menu, incredible wines, and were eyed with curiousity by the rest of the patrons. I was set up to steal the 5 inch ring binder that carries their list. I failed at that. But not at getting us into Rum Jungle later that night. Those crazy Canadians, saved my best friends birthday. Oh yeah, moral is: Love thy neighbor, but make sure they know up front you are not a working girl in a really polite way so that they still want to take you to dinner.",

But, since we were in Vegas, and didn't feel like dining with the masses from Des Moines, we thought we'd have some fun and have a nice dinner to celebrate a great 2006. The PC tablet for the wine list is great in theory, but also sort of gimmicky, and we felt that ultimately the 10,000+ bottle wine selection was a bit overwhelming. Although the sommelier was helpful in narrowing down the choices, it definitely helped to have some knowledge of wine going in.  As for the meal itself, again, good, but not great. Nothing really jumps out at me as being a standout, and I can't even recall what I ate at this point. Contrast this to some of my 5-star restaurant experiences, and I can remember every last detail. Finally, but service seemed a bit schizo... we had at least three different waiters, all of whom would show up randomly throughout the meal. So... to sum it up, if you're looking for a unique dining experience in Vegas and love wine, then definitely try Aureole. Just make sure you kick ass at the tables beforehand, otherwise it's kind of a waste of $$.",

We came in here for a drink around 10 PM Monday 12/21 night, mostly so we could check out the four story wine tower and watch the flying wine steward.  The bartender was so nice and friendly and put us at ease instantly.  He insisted we order a cheese plate, even though we were told the kitchen was closed.  Despite not being hungry, we went for it, and mmmmmmmmmmmm I am glad we did.  The three cheeses were divine!  I also appreciate him letting us taste our wines before pouring the whole glass.  And even though we did not order a bottle of wine, the lovely wine steward flew up the tower and waved down at us, which was really nice of her.  I would love to come back here for a meal based on the service, drinks, and cheese plate we received at the bar.",

Normally you're given the generic binder type thing and depending on the thickness of it immediately form an opinion of what their wine selection must be.  Well....wow...you're given the tablet and told, \"Ok miss (or whatever), you can choose a wine by type, label, region, vintage, appellation, etc\" so of course, I'm immediately overwhelmed.  I ask for the sommelier and because I'm treating (long story-it's Vegas), I ask for the last wine of the year acc. to Mr. Parker. (that's right...big spender-natch--ha!)  Boom!  There it is on the tablet pc/wine list thingie.  Funny (or curiously) enough, my friends had not heard of the famous wine tower with the famous wine angels, so I ask if he can tell us when they're getting our wine for us so we can watch our corresponding wine angel, so (very \"mission impossible-y\") he presses a forefinger to his ear and says, \"Uh, Angela?  You got the brunello?  Great. Yeah, can you turn around and wave please?\" She does.  How cool is that???  How many places can they do that in?  Not many.  Only at Aureole.  Only in Vegas, where Cirque de Soleil is the new Barnum & Bailey. Not only that, but the food is fabulous.  GREAT experience.",

You would also never think that a side dish of asparagus could also be so amazing, and the dessert was a burst of raspberry and creme.

As some people know, this is the establishment with the wine tower in which beautiful women hang from pulley systems while retrieving wines selections for guests. It's ambiance is quite pleasant, and helpful for guests who may be hard of hearing as the noise of the casino floor is deafened once you descend into the restaurant. Swans swim in the fountains outside and apparently for $10,000 you can have the swan for dinner and receive two complimentary down stuffed pillows of said swan if that's your agenda. The food is artful, creative and innovative and diverse tasting menus are also sometimes available. I recommend the lamb shank and the french onion soup and as far as desert and coffee go it's some of the best in the city. The service here is also attentive and professional. Overall this place is a wonderful spot for a lovely date night or a large Christmas party, just bring the wallet because as they say, \"you get what you pay for\".",

This actually turned out to be a strong point as the entire staff was had great knowledge of the food and the culinary cooking process.  We really enjoyed talking to each and every one of the staff from the server to the captain.  The food was all spot on -- My wife ordered butternut squash ravioli and a tai snapper while I went with the foie gras over a pork bread with a berry sorbet on top and the scallops over pork belly for my main.  Very different and it is evident the executive chef carries out charlie palmers vision of top quality pork dishes.  They bought us an incredible dessert sampler along with a plate of petit fours for the conclusion of the meal.  I advise trying this place if you are into trying out of the ordinary food executed well.  I would like to try to NYC location since that is where I live.",

The shared plate arrived with the appetizers (bad!) but the rest of the service was smooth. Our captain sent along a sorbet plate and after dinner sweets.  While we were offered drinks quickly, we passed for a nice bottle of wine. It took ages before we were able to get menus to see what we wanted to complement. The sommelier was friendly and gave a demo of the tablet pc listings but we made our own choice and only saw him one more time. For the chef I'd say forget the oscar part of the tenderloin (4 little pieces of crab and 3 long slices of asparagus) - it added nothing to one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The peppered lamb with the red pepper coulis was great with the wine. The foie gras was ok - the table beside us had a tasting menu and got a better portion of it than I did as an a la carte diner. Also it was a bit overcooked and the veins hadn't been removed. I wouldn't hurry back but I would go again.  (We had a reservation and arrived on time but were directed to sit opposite the entry. It wasn't crowded and there were staff around who could have seated us immediately. Do they think waiting leads you to think it's a better restaurant?)",

Wines are listed in and ordered from wireless electronic wine tablets (with accompanying guides). Kind of gadgety, but fun nonetheless. Wines are then retrieved by wine angels suspended by wires from the ceiling a la Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible...it's quite a show. If only the food were able to match this spectacle. That's not to say it was bad, but it was rather uneven. The meal got off to a good start with the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna Trio, a refreshingly light treatment of impeccable tuna. Slow Braised Beef Shank and Foie Gras Ravioli was unfortunately stringy and not tender though it did have good flavor. Olive Oil Poached Oregon Petrale Sole seemed to have been poached at too high a temperature and was tough as well. Modesto County Pan-Seared Rabbit was nicely done with good earthy flavors, but the Duo of Beef Tenderloin and Flat Iron again disappointed with overdone meat. We concluded with a nice cheese course with brioche (how about a bit more fruit for this??) and concluded with a delicious Meyer Lemon Parfait with Lemoncello Sorbet. At a restaurant of this stature, things such as overdone meats should never happen...it makes the kitchen seem amateurish. Which is really too bad since we enjoyed the rest of our evening. This makes me wish Charlie Palmer would try to lure Michael (or Bryan) Voltaggio back to his group in partnership to kickstart this place.",
