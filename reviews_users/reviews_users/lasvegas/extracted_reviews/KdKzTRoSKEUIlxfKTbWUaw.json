    "text": "A Tale of Two Crepes  After hearing great things about this place, I'm glad to have finally tried it. I'm new to the Japanese-style crepe, but rolling a filled crepe like an ice cream cone is brilliant. My husband loves crepes and ice cream, so I thought he would love this place. Then, I saw what he had ordered.  I should have been paying attention because I fear he got confused while looking at the menu, but I was distracted by the thought of the apple a la mode crepe. In the end, he's eating a crepe-cone full of berries, cheesecake pieces, and... multi-colored birthday cake ice cream?!?! I must have missed something. Maybe a 3 year old child wandered up to the counter and ordered for him. Then, a stunning work of art arrives at the table. My crepe contains crisp apple slices, caramel sauce, cinnamon sugar, graham cracker crumbles, whipped cream, and walnut ice cream. The flavor is even buttery, just like apple pie. But, my elegant dessert is ashamed to sit at the same table as his confused concoction. The fresh apples stand up and do a Church Lady-inspired \"Superior Dance\" in the direction of his ugly crepe. He has no complaints, but doesn't seem to appreciate the mockery.  The moral of this story is to think out your order before you commit a crepe mistake.",

I was looking for a breakfast place not too far from our resort-this really isn't one, but it ended up really tasty, and with everyone happy, how could that be bad? First, the staff was really patient with me and my two  young sons-being our first time there, and having soooo many options... We settled on the make your own options, which got kind of costly with my mini-me foodies, but so worth it! These people are food artists, and made beautiful dishes of our waffles-not just a boring waffle with stuff thrown on! My sons picked some very unique Japanese sodas, they were so cool, I let them get two! We all got waffles, but the crepes looked really cool-more of a snack maybe. They even have games on a shelf to hang out and play-we stayed for a few highly competitive games of Connect 4- Oh, and the place is reallllly clean. Kudos Crepe Shack-we'll be back!!",

They lost a star from me because even though they have delicious crepes, I would appreciate it more if their service was not so dry. I understand you're a business, but putting on a smile might help people feel more welcomed to come more often.   Collect a stamp card if you plan on frequenting the joint.",

Needless to say when I arrived at the front door I discovered they do not open until 11:00 A.M.  Really?  Who eats breakfast at 11:00 A.M.?  In Vegas most people are eating lunch at 11:A.M.",

The softness of the pancake in relation with the ice cream, whip cream and fruits is enough to make me die and go to heaven. They have so many toppings and flavors! Not to mention, if you're a fan of Thrifty's Ice Cream - that's the type they serve here. My go to is ALWAYS the rebel special which consist of strawberry, banana, and nutella. I opt for vanilla flavor though since I don't want anything to overpower the deliciousness that nutella has to offer. PLUS! Nutella and vanilla is a classic pairing that you can't go wrong with.  The place itself is very modern, clean, and spacious. There's even some board games customers can play to kill time while hanging out. If I was still in high school and lived in this area.. I would use this place as a meet-up spot or something.  As long as I continue to work in Henderson or whenever I'm in the area and craving something sweet (which like I stated is rare) - Crepe Shack here I come!",

Finally, I decided to get the Maui Fever crepe that came with shredded coconut, kiwi, strawberries, and pineapple.  Then I had to decide on ice cream, extra fruit, or yogurt.  I twisted my own arm and went with ice cream and got the cappuccino chuck.  The owner explained that the crepe came without utensils and I thought that was special!  I watched him make the crepe and then I watched and the woman put the fruit and other things on the crepe and gently fold the crepe so it came out like an ice cream cone and I was handed that.  The owner came by in a little bit an explained that I should squeeze the top together.  It would be easier to eat and I'd get a mixture of the fruit and it would taste better.  He was right.  I don't think I'll be coming back.  While the crepe was good, the shop is on the opposite side of town from where I live.  I also like eating with utensils but this is their place and they go with the tradition.",

The ingredients were fresh and the taste showed it. They also throw in a scoop of ice cream, I got butter pecan, which is another cool twist from the norm.  Wife and I also split a banana foster waffle which was cooked well and tasty, but I enjoyed the crepe more. If you're in the Vegas area, you must try this place. I most definitely will return.",

They're very quick and efficient and its fun to watch them make the crepes.   I also really like Thrifty ice cream... its yummy!  Unfortunately, I remember how much the ice cream costed when I was young so its strange spending this much (but it is really good!)  I will be back with my family and friends to try more.    I think they have a fun ice cream special on Wednesdays!",

Really - it's that flipping good!  I ordered two crepes - The Classic and the Rebel Special.  The Classic - I first fell in love with Nutella in a crepe. This brought me right back to 2006, but this baby packed a surprise - slivered almonds! The added crunch along with the bananas and Nutella, you really can't go wrong.  Rebel Special - bananas, super fresh strawberries, warm Nutella. I don't really need to go further.   Here you can order custom parfaits and crepes, and I believe they also have chai teas.  This place would be like 10 out 5 if they offered savory crepes.",

It had PB, cookie pieces/cookie dough, chocolate syrup, and we had a scoop of ice cream with whipped cream. It was insanely good! The crepe was light and tasty. Anything with PB and chocolate will taste good to me.  They have board games that can you play while you eat.  The staff was very friendly and willing to answer any questions.  I will be back. I want to try the waffles. Two thumbs up!",

    "text": "Ahh so close to me but yet  no time to try this place out until now. After trying these crepes I need to make time in my busy life for such yumminess!!!! The batter of the crepe is light but filling at the same time especially because it's a good size crepe not a skimpy small circle of batter. I love they they use fresh fruits and not fruits that have been marinating in a thick goop of high fructose corn syrup living life in a tin can waiting to be open for years now. Yup, fresh fruits always win in my book....   I will declare my one star off now:  NO MANGO ICE CREAM!!!!!!  I have been day dreaming of my first experience at Crepe Shack & Waffles: Wearing hott pink heels I slowly walk in,hair blowing in the wind (wearing a hott pink bow to match the heels of course), my nose instantly stunned by the sweet aroma of fresh crepes, my eyes (with hott pink eyeshadow to match the heels & bow of course) blinded by the beauty of my favorite ice cream -MANGO- Wait a freakin minute - The Mango Ice cream was just seasonal.... Yup my day dream turned into an episode of Punked!!!  Yes, I was disappointed but hopefully the Mango Ice cream will make a guest appearance again even though I think it should be a staple on the menu as in just about all Japanese Restaurants Mango Ice Cream Mochi is always offered, Just sayin.....  We tried:  -The Strawberry Cheesecake Crepe: Strawberries,bits of Cheesecake,  Strawberry syrup, whipped cream and Birthday cake ice cream : YUM!!!!  -The Rebel Crepe : Bananas, Strawberries, Nutella, Whipped Cream and Vanilla Ice Cream: YUM!!!! -The Brownie Crepe (I'm not sure of the name): Brownie Chunks, marshmallows,whipped cream, caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream: I didn't try this one but the people who did said it was - YUM!!!! -Bananas Foster Crepe: Vanilla Ice Cream,Bananas,Cinnamon,Caramel and Whipped Cream - YUM!!! -Scoop of Chocolate Malt Crunch Ice Cream- I liked it but my sister thought it lacked a strong chocolate taste - that's why it has MALT in it's name - that should clue you in that it won't have an extra strong Chocolate taste. So there's my verdict- 4 YUMS!!!! -  Very open and clean place - We enjoyed ourselves!!!! I did ask for a printed menu and they didn't have any- Hope they do print some cause they sure come in handy when you want to call in a order.....",

I mean yummy crunchy strawberries, just the way I like.... (^_^) Had it w/ vanilla ice cream.  Just PURE AWESOMENESS.... NO LIE!! haha! Best crepes I've had by far.  I MUST GO AGAIN!! Found me a new fav place! Also, very cheap!! WOOHOO!!! Been feening for more since then.  The guy who helped me out was real nice.  & since I checked in via YELP.... it opened up a 10% discount for this place. Even better since i'm a coupon fanatic!!!  ; ) YAY! I have yet to try the waffles & other flavors.  I should definitely be giving another review on this place when I have the chance to go again.  Hopefully the other flavors I'll be trying next blows me away like the 1st one did.  The only thing the place needs is maybe a lil more decor.  It's clean which is a big plus for me as usual.  Seems like a lot of space that's not being used but it's ok I guess.  Crepe lovers.... seriously... check it out.",

There isn't much to say that other reviewers haven't already said.  Getting a crepe all wrapped up like an ice cream cone with delicious toppings inside was just plain awesome.  My wife had the Apple ala Mode and I had the Splits.  While both crepes were great, the Apple ala Mode might be one of the best desserts I've ever had.  The apples were perfectly cut so they weren't too large or small and the graham crackers just sealed the deal!  We sat and ate our crepes and almost bought two more to take home with us.  The price ($5) is a great deal as well!  Can't wait to go back.",

You walk into a clean,open space and you are greeted by friendly people who are ready to introduce you to the world of Japanese crepes. Unlike the crepes I am used to, this crepe was rolled up into a cone and eaten without utensils.  The menu is displayed on tv screens. No paper menus are available. It was explained to me that the reason behind this is because the menu options change to reflect item availability. So you know what you are getting is FRESH.  They have numerous tasty combinations with appealing names like Tickle Me Berry and Cookie Monster. And if the specialty crepes don't tickle your fancy, then you can create your own. And all crepe fillings can also be topped onto a waffle.  I had the \"East Meets West\", a crepe filled with red bean paste, condensed milk and mochi bites. I added strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. It was a little too heavy on the red bean paste for my taste, but the fruit was so fresh and delicious.  The only thing: I wish this place had savory crepes. But if ever my sweet tooth wants a crepe, this place is where I will go. And the price is right (average $5-7)  p.s.

Even though I told her I stalked them on the internet, she was cordial enough to give us the low down on their crepes and what they had to offer. She was super sweet and didn't mind explaining the few questions we had.  I ended up getting the 'Come Away With Me' crepe with vanilla ice cream, it was heavenly! They make the crepes Japanese style, so you'll find Japanese snacks and sodas are also available. They make everything while you watch, which was fun. Also make sure to ask for a spoon. They promote eating them with your mouth ONLY, so spoons are behind the counter. LOL  Overall it was clean, the service was awesome, the crepe was divine, and I will definitely be back to try a waffle next time!",

Service is an A. Their coffee crunch (forgot the exact name of it) ice cream is good. A good variety of fresh toppings. One of the guys, who seems to be slightly older than other workers I've seen there before, makes the crepes very well. The others make them just fine as well.  They offer other items such as waffles, juices, and food I believe.",

This may be the best place to go to for some fastneasy dessert. The crepe is a perfect consistency, not too thin/thick. I agree with some other yelpers, a few more seconds on the hot pan for a crispy effect won't do any harm! Maybe I'll just ask for it next time (which might be tonight....yum.....as they close at 10pm!) The waffles come out crunchy on the outside and deliciously soft on the inside. I would ask for this to be a little crispier as well. Just because I like crispy foods. Also gotta love the boardgames they have for everyone to enjoy. Can't get beat at connect4 again! ...Just another excuse to go back for crepes :) +Did I mention service was impeccable? All that you could ever ask for in a place like this.",

I odered the Tickle Me Berry, and other than the fruits were fresh, it was just a standard thing wrapped in a crepe.  I was expecting something more decadent.  There was nothing special about the ice cream.  The staff was not personable, and the guy who took my order was not giving me enough time to peruse the menu.  No, I've been to better ice cream/dessert places.",

I enjoy the Make Your Own Crepe they have, but trust me - try one of the ones on the menu because they know crepes!  The prices are slightly higher than average but for those nights when you just want a good dessert, splurge here.  In recent visits they have added Japanese snacks and boardgames, making this a pretty nice hangout for all!  Plus they sell t-shirts that say, \"I'd eat it.\"  Come on now, how cool is that?  Hopefully they have sugar-free ice cream options soon!  Or if they do, I missed them... which makes me a sad panda.  P.S. Nutella + Peanut Butter = DELISH!",

    "text": "The wife is from Japan and a serious sweet hound so when I told her I had some coupons to a Japanese style crepe spot she demanded we go.  When we walked the cashier was friendly and explained what they did, your options (crepe or waffle) and your choice of ice cream or extra fruit, and whipped cream. I went with the Bananas Foster crepe with extra fruit and whipped cream, the wife went with the Apple-a la mode with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  The crepe was cooked well and I enjoyed the non-overly sweet filling as mine had brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel which is usually an formula for sweetness overload but they managed to find a great balance of flavor and sweetness. The wife really enjoyed her crepe with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream finding it's way into every bite. Both of our crepes were made with care and it showed in presentation which is a major part of desert.  Some highlights: I really enjoyed the fact that I could get extra fruit instead of ice cream. The staff were warm and friendly.   We got there at 9:00pm and the place seemed to be have a steady stream of people coming and going.  Price wise, you're going to spend $5 a crepe, a bargain if you ask me considering that you are getting fresh fruit and a freshly made crepe.  As a techie I really enjoyed that there were power plugs at table level for those bringing in a notebook to get some work done while enjoying desert.  We will definitely be back.",

He care about satisfaction of his customers and is connected with the food truck movement-which is a A+ in my book.  While this place is not a place to go to for a full meal, it is a nice place to stop for a quick snack or breakfast.  The prices are reasonable, and there are many items on the menu to choose from.  I still have not tried everything on the menu.  One can customize their own crepe or waffle, or select from one of the many specialty crepes.  The store will also post via facebook specials deals or food items, which is alway a gem to look for.   My wife and I recommend this a lot and have taken many friends/family here whom all have had nothing but great things about this place.

A soft, freshly cooked crepe wrapped in a cone shape and topped with one of their original fruit combos, or you can make your own. They have a wide variety of ice creams that can be added to the crepe for no additional charge, or for you healthy eaters, you can opt to have extra fruit or yogurt added for less calories, and its still just as good! Fruit is fresh!   I've had bananas foster (banana with brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel) topped with vanilla ice cream. Sounds way to sweet doesnt it? Well, it isnt! They add just a little for flavor. A lot goes a long way in these crepes!   I come twice a week (sometimes twice in a day) when I feel my sweet tooth coming on.

The staff always greets you immediately, and with a smile, even when the place is super busy.  9 times out of 10 I will order \"The Elvis\" crepe (no honey, sub condensed milk, strawberry ice cream).  When I'm in the mood for something extra sweet and fruity I get the \"Strawberry Sensation\".  Hubby prefers the \"Deluxe PBJ\".

It didn't take them long at all to make the waffles they were so delicious 1 waffle turned into 2, then 3..I had to take the last one to go or else I could spend all day eating waffles their. But anyhow if you're looking for some very good waffles of all different specialties such as with strawberries, bananas, nutella, cinnamon, powdered sugar, whipped cream, or just plain this is the place to come. Also, they serve Thrifty Ice Cream as an added topping!! YUMS!!!  Customer service was Excellent!!

(I didn't care for the cheesecake bites combined in but that's just me). Also got the Rebel waffle with mint chip ice cream. The waffle was fresh and warm but not too warm...the ice cream didn't melt (yay).   Chris was very cool and helpful with our order being it was our first time. Patient and gave good suggestions.   Fresh fruits on display and sliced to order...AND featuring good ol Thrifty Ice Cream!!!!",

For some reason, my directions took me to the completely wrong shopping center, so I called the crepe place and they were happy to give me the correct cross street.  I built my own crepe with green tea ice cream, Nutella, and mochi, which was delicious! The crepe here was softer than other Japanese crepes I've had before (which were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside), but this one was still good. Only complaint I have is that most of my mochi ended up in the very bottom of my crepe, instead of being more evenly spread out.  Check in with yelp and get 10% off! Also, bring water with you if you need something to cleanse your palate between the sweet bites.",

    "text": "I was a little surprised. My wife loves crepes and I wanted to take her to breakfast on our way home from Vegas. Our first choice had a 45 minute wait and I didn't want to stay that long. We found a second place with another long wait. Using the Yelp app I found this place. Lots of reviews, high star rating, but I didn't read the reviews. I suggested we try it. I was please seeing the door was open and there was no line. Walking inside I thought it was a little odd because it looked like a Baskin Robbins, and when I saw the menu say it comes with your choice of ice cream I thought that was odd. I noticed the photos with waffles, but didn't pay attention to the others I guess. The waffles looked big and delicious; we ordered the crepes. We were talking and drinking a coffee when the guy behind the counter brought my wife's order. We both looked puzzled at it and him because it was like an ice cream cone. She looked at me and asked how she was going to eat that. Mine came next and it too was a cone.  Then I read the Yelp reviews and saw it was a dessert place and not a breakfast place. It was probably way too sweet for 10 AM, but it was very good. I would definitely come back and order it in the late afternoon or early evening sometime. I had the Elvis and it was excellent. She ordered the Rebel but doesn't like Nutella so it was basically strawberry and banana. The place was super clean and the staff very friendly. It turned out to be a good find even though it wasn't what we were looking for at that time.",

The shop and decor are very simple and bright.  We were greeted immediately and asked if we'd ever been there before.  When we told the employee that we hadn't he gladly explained the Japanese crepe concept, what comes with the crepe, and offered suggestions.  I had lots of questions (\"Would this go well with that?\", \"what flavor would you recommend?\", etc.) and he was happy to answer them or ask for his coworkers' opinions.    My husband ordered the \"Tickle Me Berry\" as a waffle and got vanilla yogurt on the side.  The crepes/waffles all come with a scoop of ice cream (there are a number of flavors to choose from), or a scoop of vanilla yogurt.  He wanted to get a crepe but said the waffle just looked so good when he saw it, and it was!  I chose a crepe and it was so easy to eat.  It looks difficult because it's rolled up, sort of like a cone, but the crepe itself holds the contents well and allows you to get a little bit of everything in each bite.    We got to watch them make our tasty meals and the food was up very quickly.  The prices were SO reasonable.  I mean, $4.95 for this crepe that totally filled me, and $5.95 for the waffle.   There are so many different \"creations\" that I can't wait to go and try more!  Some of the crepes/waffles make for a great breakfast, and others are well-suited for a snack or dessert.    Great service, unique flavor combos, all at a great price.  It's definitely my kind of place and one I'm sure I'll visit many more times!",

Although I did notice maintenance paper covering some windows all the way towards the ceiling.  Maybe they weren't done renovating? Free Wi-Fi to do homework/study which is a major plus =)  There's a glass separation between you and the crepe-making table so you can see your order being made.  What I disliked about it was how tall it was.  I could barely hear the employee on the other side of the bar and I couldn't speak to her either.  There are shirts hanging on the wall for self-promotion.  And they're pretty cute if you're a serious fan and you want to purchase them.  Customers: Not busy the day I visited, but the owner (who personally made the crepes my friend and I had ordered) said it was a slow day.  There's usually more people.  This crowd consisted of people in their teens to early 20's.  Since my friend and I were first-timers, one of the customers even suggested her favorites to us.  That was nice of her.  Service: Very nice employees who seem eager to help.  But the cashier seemed annoyed because I think I was talking to him too much.  For the impatient people, these crepes take time.  The crepes are made and fruits are sliced to order so it'll take a while if you're on the go.  I wouldn't go here if you've got only 3 minutes til you have to get to work. And imagine if there was a long line...  The Food: Fluffy crepe batter.  Fresh fruit.  Yummy and cold ice cream.  Did I say fresh fruit?  It was wrapped in a paper cone which annoyed me because 1) the paper is thick to rip apart and 2) I kept biting into it.  But otherwise, it's a sturdy holder for your crepe.    I would definitely love to come here again because it was delicious and the people are nice and helpful.  Plus, fruit is yummy.",

The guys working were welcoming and friendly. Very willing to give whatever information is needed. This interesting concept is a first for I. A crepe that is wrapped into a cone to hold ice cream and other toppings. They did have ice cream, shakes and other types of sweets. I decided on the Nutty Buddha with vanilla ice cream. The toppings weere peanut butter, bananas and Nutella spread. It was very interesting to attack it. I was told to squeeze out the insides and eat it like that. But I tried to eat some of the crepe so I wouldn't be left with only crepe at the end. I would have liked alot more ice cream but that's just my love of ice cream talking lol. These Japanese style crepes are worth trying at least once. It's like having a waffle cone but instead of crispy, its soft, chewy and warm.",

And this place smelled so sweet when I walked in. You could have things such as rocky road themed crepes or waffles or even just plain ice cream. I am a sweet tooth fiend, so all of the options were just overwhelming! I ordered the waffle with blueberries, strawberries, cheesecake, side of whip and strawberry cheesecake ice cream. DELISH!!! haha. If ever I'm on this side of town again, I'll be sure to make another visit.",

Overall I would recommend if you're in the mood for a crepe or waffle with icecream and or fruit toppings, but if you are from somewhere else that had crepes of a similar style you may want to wait until you get back home.  This place was near our hotel and was worth stopping by. We had some for a late breakfast. It's not very expensive (~$6 ea) but not very filling either.",

All the ingredients are wonderfully fresh, and the crepes are made with great care.  Or, you can choose from a large list of items to create your own masterpiece. The possibilities are endless.  There's also a number of coffees, juice, water and tea among other items, all presented in a clean and welcoming atmosphere. The prices are very competitive too.

This was very helpful since I don't visit crepe places too often. The ice cream they use ($1.00 extra, I believe) is Thrifty. Thrifty ice cream made the crepe that much better. Overall the crepe was delicious. The sweets balanced out the flavor with the crepe and it was never overpowering. It was balanced and flavorful. The atmosphere was relaxed and very clean. I will definitely be coming back to try their other crepe options.",

The smells of fresh crepes, ice cream, and fruit was amazing, and I was excited to try one of their delicious desserts.  There were lots of people there, so it was a little crowded and very overwhelming. The family in front of us took forever to decide on what to order, and they kept arguing, but the waiter was very attentive and patient with them, so I give him props for that.  I ordered the Banana Cheese Pie Crepe, which is a crepe filled with (my choice) vanilla ice cream and topped with sliced bananas, graham cracker crumbs, cheesecake bites, and drizzled with white chocolate syrup. It was a perfect sized portion, the service was super quick, and the presentation was marvelous.   I liked the idea of serving ice cream and toppings in a crepe, but I don't know if it was just me, but it was a little difficult to bite into. However, the taste itself was extremely delicious but subtle. It wasn't overpowered by abundant amounts of sugar, so it was really good after I got the hang of eating it.   Overall, The Crepe Shack was a beautiful place, and I'm so happy I came in here. Next time, I'm planning on trying a waffle. However, the crepe was amazing, and I would highly recommend it to all of the sweet tooths out there.",

As I stepped in this place was nice overall with its brightly covered walls, cleanliness, and friendly staff. As I got to the cash register, the cashier immediately informed me of their three most popular crepes: banana foster, rebel special, and tickle me berry!  I opted for tickle me berry with green tea icecream & cheesecake bites, and my sister kept it simple with the rebel special. BOTH WERE DELISH! You know that feeling when you bite into a dessert and there's just absolute bliss? Well, I experienced it. The berries were as fresh as can be and all of the flavors put together were perfect! I also tried my sisters and realized that no crepe is complete without Nutella. Her simple crepe was just as amazing.   I only give this place four stars because I feel like the crepe batter itself could have more flavor. My crepe was a bit thick and lacked clear flavor. Other than that, I guess the fun is what's in the crepes!",

I was doing my research and came across the reviews and the eye catching pictures that were posted by other Yelpers and thought this place would be best.   Walking into the Crepe Shack & Waffles already confirmed that I had chosen the right place. The smell of waffles and crepes being made in front of you was heavenly and sweet! The interior is also colorful, clean, and inviting. What made things even better was the option to come up with your own combination of ice cream, toppings, and syrup choice. Since it was my first time coming I went with the classic on a crepe cone, which came with banana, almonds, and nutella with my choice of vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend on the other hand had the strawberry sensation: strawberries, cheesecake bites, and strawberry syrup.   It was no surprise to us that the crepe cones were delicious hearing all the good things about this place, but the one thing we didn't care for was that they separated the ice cream from all the toppings. We thought it would have been much better to have our ice cream together with our syrup and toppings. It was like one side had ice cream and the other side nuts and nutella. Also the crepes tasted a bit bland. There was no flavor or sweetness of its own. We felt like this was something we could make at home.Other than that this place is good. I'm definitely coming back to try their cookie ice cream sandwich.",

    "text": "I've never once been disappointed with Crepe Shack and I believe this was my 6th time!  Because I don't live in Henderson, it's pretty far (make another location, please!) but if I could I would probably get obsessed with the crepes here. If you haven't been here before, you order a crepe or waffle. There is a make-your-own crepe and waffle choice, where you can pick your own toppings and ice cream. There are some choices on another menu board for the crepes and waffles that already have suggested combination of toppings, you just pick your own ice cream.   Ex: Cookie Monster - Cookie Dough + Oreos + Peanut Butter w/ whatever ice cream you like!  My friends and I ordered:  1. Maui Fever CREPE - Shredded Coconut + Strawberry + Pineapple + Kiwi w/ green tea ice cream 2. East Meets West CREPE - Red Bean + Condensed Milk + Mochi Bites w/ green tea ice cream 3. Make-your-own crepe with mango, strawberries, cheesecake bites, whipped cream (and without ice cream) 4. East Meets West WAFFLE - Red Bean + Condensed Milk + Mochi Bites w/ green tea ice cream  My crepe was slightly crispy on the edges and chewy on the rest of it. I would've liked to to be more crispier but the batter tasted delicious, and the ice cream also softens up the crepe. I ordered the Maui Fever crepe but I prefer ones with chocolate so I might try for different. Overall, crepe was big and yummy, fruits are fresh, ice cream is creamy and the service is attentive and polite! I can't wait to come here again =)  There are pictures that I have posted up as well, so be sure to check those out!",

Looking at the pictures, it obviously looks and sounds delicious, but I just assumed that the ice cream is added to mask bland and boring waffles and crepes.  Boy was I wrong!  The waffle and crepe stood out and were very fresh, the Thrifty ice cream was just a topping and I would have loved my food without the ice cream added!  Plus, there are endless possible combinations available, so you can do something different every time you go, and if you aren't looking for ice cream or something super sweet, you can substitute yogurt or extra fruit instead, which is awesome!  Highly recommend that everyone in the are give this place your business so that they can stay in business!  My one complaint....no soda fountain?  Just hot chocolate or overpriced drinks from a cooler.  Get a soda fountain guys, they are cheap, and each soda only costs you about 15 cents but you can charge a buck, so it will boost your profits.",

    "text": "Japanese style crepes? Say what?? I had the pleasure to experience this Japanese delight and let's just say that maybe my selection wasn't all that great but everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs.   We went towards closing so there was hardly anyone there. Overall the place is clean but nothing that wows you when you walk in. I will admit that the bathrooms have pepto colored walls that it can stir up a bowel movement...just sayin'.  Anyways  moving on to the crepe, they're made to order so they're as fresh as it can come. Picture Cold Stone but with hand held crepes (waffle cone style). The scent of crepes lingers in the air and takes you to that delighful moment of bliss. They have a pre-made menu to select from or you can make your own. Truthfully, it's cheaper to choose their menu than to make your own.  Well I choose the one with caramel, brownie bites and marshmellows. Sugar shock indeed! The crepe was light and fluffy that it had a soft fortune cookie taste (as Paolo stated in prevvious review). Luckily they give you whatever ice cream flavor you want and whip cream so I played it safe by picking vanilla. Surprisingly I wasn't a big fan of it. I felt that they should have combined the items together instead of keep them separate. I didn't like having a bite of just marshmellows then the next bite was just brownie. It didn't please the palate very well. I knew I should of stayed with the Strawberry Sensation crepe!   In the end, this is a great place to get dessert crepes but in my opinion I would stick with the ones that offer some type of fruit as it balances out better than one with brownie or marshmellows. I only wish they offered non-dessert like crepes then I might give it 5-stars!",

I just wasn't a fan of these \"Japanese\" style crepes because of the thickness and heavy use of vanilla. I was expecting a variety of crepes and all they had were sweet which made the wife happy..at first. We are both very much into the traditional French Crepe which are much thinner and more egg based compared to the ones served at the Crepe Shack. The presentation as a cone was interesting and I had an issue with eating the crepe with plastic utensils. The lack of variety, savory and breakfast offerings, and the style of crepe, was the overall knock on this place.",

My favorite is a build-your-own with cheesecake, graham crackers, bananas, whipped cream, and vanilla ice-cream.   Everyone who works there is super friendly and patient. I once was craving a crepe, but I was just getting off of work at 9:30pm--and they close at 10pm. I rushed home and picked up my sister (because she wanted one too) and we called the Crepe Shack and put in our order as I was rushing down St. Rose Pkwy. We made it there about 15 minutes before they closed, and when we arrived the staff was patiently finishing off our crepes. They even put then in little to-go boxes, and packaged the ice-cream separately so it wouldn't melt. I know first hand how annoying it is to have people run into an establishment while I'm trying to clean up, and they tolerated us with a smile on their face.  They offer punch cards (get your tenth crepe free!) and they offer a lot of discounts, especially if you subscribe to their text newsletters.   Clean establishment, great staff, great food--what more could you ask for?",

Great effort as everyone is super nice in there but there were a few things off with the crepe I had. First, when I got mine, it was cold, cold, cold! so the ingredients I chose didn't even melt together to create a warm, scrumptious flavor. The crepe itself was doughy and ended up being chewy. And I would suggest adding more ingredients so there's goodies near the bottom of the crepe rather than just having the chewy, doughy crepe to eat.",

As soon as you go in, a delicious smell hits you and you can't wait to get your crepe! I had the mix with raspberries instead of bananas, vanilla yogurt instead of ice cream, and it was awesome! I love the combination of fresh fruits with the sweet crepe. I actually lived in france for 3 years, so i've had my share of crepes. Although this is different from a french style crepe, which is more on the buttery, heavy side (not airy, just to add. a crepe is thin but not meant to be airy.. it's not a souffle), it was soooo enjoyable, with a fortune cookie taste. I've tried japanese style crepes a few times in cali, but nothing really struck me enough for me to crave them. But I can't wait to go try more crepes at cs&w! I'll definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone!",

I've read a lot of the reviews of this place and I do agree that it does live up to the hype if your a lover for Crepes. I like to call them JDM Crepes (any car enthusiast would understand lol).  Quality: The Crepe itself was soft and it was prepared neatly with all the additions of my order.  Service: The lady upfront was very helpful on what she recommended after wanting to try something with Strawberries and Blueberries. I ordered the \"Make Me A Swirl\" with Black Cherry ice cream and whip cream and it sure was beyond delicious =) (No more then 5 mins to receive my order)  Price: I like to consider it cheap for a desert for the serving size that is given. I paid $5.95 in total after taxes. I would probably be eating here more then getting a Boba drink.  Bring a date here for dessert and you'll definitely be scoring some points.",

If you don't find their creations to your liking, you can opt for a creation of your own. There are so many choices, you might want to try them all.  This place is a must whenever I have family and friends in town, they are never disappointed! They often tell me they had a craving for Crepe Shack after they return home.   The atmosphere is fun and comfortable. There are games and music, plus crepe deliciousness!   Lookout Crepe Shack, I'm bringing another newbie this week!",

It was only a 20 minute drive from the strip...we were out driving around and wound up close to it anyway.    The dude who rang us up was very friendly and offered my husband and I some recommendations.  I ordered the \"Rebel Special\" crepe... which is filled with strawberry, banana, and nutella.  These are Japanese style crepes, which get rolled up and eaten with your hands like a delicious crepe burrito.  My hubby and I were starving so we also shared a bananas foster waffle.  Both the crepe and the waffle were to die for.  They did not skimp on the toppings.  The waffle was crisp and cooked perfectly.  The crepe was one of the best I've ever had.  Whenever I'm back in Vegas again, I will definitely hit up Crepe Shack again.",

Before this, I've only had the traditional crepes that are rolled with sauce and toppings drizzled over it.   Here they have Japanese crepes.   It is filled with the dessert toppings and scoop of ice cream of your choice.  They have many options with pre-determined filling.  It's great for people like me who can't make a decision.     The crepes and waffles are made there when you order.  I chose the banana cheese pie crepe filled with cheesecake, white chocolate sauce, bananas, graham crackers and whipped cream.  Can I get a hell yeah?! I went with vanilla ice cream so it wouldn't take away from the others toppings.  The crepe itself is formed into a waffle cone shape to hold all of the goodness.  I loved it! It's different and fulfills my sugar craving.  A friend of mine ordered a dessert waffle.  Honestly it was just ok.  I'd choose the crepe over that.     Service was great.  Both gentlemen were very helpful and friendly.  They made our first visit a delight! I am happy to add this to my dessert list!",

First off, it's dessert crepes, Japanese style, meaning the crepe acts almost like a cone which is then filled with whatever toppings plus ice cream you want! The crepes are absolutely delicious.  Plus they also have waffles which are also good!  My favorite crepes are Strawberry Sensation (strawberries and cheesecake bites) or the Cookie Monster (cookie dough, peanut butter and oreos)  Being so close to Coronado High School, I used to go there and eat crepes while playing games and chatting with my friends. It's a great place and I always love coming here.",

They are patient and will help you choose the right flavor.  I usually stick with the following choices: (forgive me if I can't remember the exact names)  - East meets West. Great combination of red bean, condensed milk and mochi. Best topped off green tea ice cream. I prefer this as a crepe.  - Strawberry cheesecake.  I love this on a waffle and get strawberry cheesecake ice cream and extra condensed milk syrup.  - Bananas foster.  I prefer this on a waffle as well.  - Apple pie a la mode. I love the flavors of apple pie and this is great as a crepe or waffle.  Another plus is that they use Thrifty ice cream.  I like chocolate malt crunch and birthday cake.",

Japanese crepes are made with icecream, fruit and whipped cream. No veggies and meat!!!! Crepe shack and waffles serve only Japanese style dessert crepes.  The second you open the door the sweet smell of crepes will hit you. There are a ton of board games for you to play and the restaurant is large enough that you can spend a good chunk of time there without other customers giving you the stink eye to leave so they can sit.  Choose your crepe flavor and then choose your icecream (Thriftys!)  My favorite is the Rebel Special with butter pecan icecream.   They are really big on you eating crepes the \"proper\" way and thus don't have spoons out for you to use. Ask one of the guys behind the counter and they'll give you one :)  Cute, cute date spot!

They have smoothies, Thriftys ice cream, Japanese style crepes and waffles. He definitely made choosing my dessert a little easier.   I ended up making my own waffle with green tea ice cream, strawberries, almonds and condensed milk. I fell in love with the green tea icecream! I just wished my waffle was a bit more crispy. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry sensation crepe. I took a bite of his and it was delicious. I prefer the crepe over the waffles.   I was never a big crepe fan but this place has converted me.

The kind gentleman who was taking the order asked the guy making the crepe (apparently its usually the same guy) and he was SO RUDE. He looked so irritated and shook his head and said NO . I was just really taken back and i stared at him and he just stared back at me like wtf do you want me to do. I was just so.. at a loss of words. She ended up not getting anything and it was so awkward.. the cashier felt so bad he apologized to us and gave us coupons which i gave to another friend.

The fillings are up to you, and they have a huge selection! Nutella, tons of fresh fruit, sauces, brownie bits, and tons more.  I went with the bananas foster (vanilla ice cream, of course). It was a decadent creation with ripe bananas, cinnamon, and a great caramel sauce. Between the wrapped layers of crepes, they had sprinkled cinnamon sugar. Great attention to detail! Husband went with the Take Me Away (chocolate ice cream). Brownie bits, marshmallows, and caramel. His was very good too, but we both agree mine was the winner.  Can't wait to be back in Vegas to try some of the fruit creations...",

I ordered the banana foster crepe, which is the third most popular crepe they have. I think the filling inside the crepe is good, but the taste of the crepe isn't the greatest. I think they should also have savory crepes here, but they don't. I saw there was a few board games in the corner to play with such as sorry or even Jenga! I felt this place was more like a high school hangout. I plan on coming here again & try more of their flavors they have on their menu.",

Rolled up like a soft ice-cream cone, it's a hand-held treat.  Reasonable prices, fresh ingredients, and they make it quickly.  It's about a 15-20 minute drive from the Strip area, but it's worth it.",

They have a convenient groupon now deal every night that saves you three bucks if you're in the mood for a tasty desert.  First things first-- the staff is very friendly and they will be more than happy to direct your ordering and help you customize your treat. I went with the rebel special at their suggestion and decided the plain vanilla yogurt would best enhance its flavor. It was an irresistible combination of strawberry, banana and nutella-- although I could have gone with a bit more tasty nutella.  My girlfriend opted for the tango mango which contained delicious coconut and condensed milk as well as some in house made vanilla ice cream.  They make their food right in front of you so you know you're not getting any shady business when you eat here. There is a huge selection on crepes and ice cream which they make themselves so you can try something different every night.   We will definitely be back here the next time we have an irresistible craving for tasty desserts.",

I'm very big on desserts, especially crepes and cool, different looking food. The way I found this place was through a few friends post on social media. It looked really delicious and I had to join the hype and try it. As soon as you go in, the atmosphere is really inviting, nice music, pretty painted walls, and pictures of crepes and waffles hung up. When you get to the cashier they'll always ask at first if you've been there before, unless they recognize you which they usually do for me now lol. Anyways at first I wanted the Rebel Special, which is one of the most popular but I can't have banana. Hearing that, the cashier told me I could make any kind of crepe, so of course I took advantage of that. I got a crepe with vanilla ice cream, Nutella, blackberries, strawberries, whipped cream, and cheesecake bites. And omg when I ate it, it was so delicious! They also use Thrifty's ice cream which makes it even better. The batter they use is good too because I've also tried this order with a waffle and waffle or crepe, they both taste so good and different than other crepes/waffles. This place truly is so good, I go so often the owner has memorized my order. I'm just waiting until he finally names it after me ;) lol but really though, once you go you'll come back, they always do!",

The thing that really brought me in was the thrifty ice cream sign as it brings back childhood memories of actual thrifty retail stores in so. California that served ice cream near the cash wrap.  Upon entering it was completely empty and I thought maybe we made a mistake, But alas one of the staff members approached us and asked if this was our first time and he then proceeded to explain the menu and the fact that the crepes are Japanese style, meaning they are rolled like a burrito in the shape of an ice cream cone. He recommended a few things and we ended up getting the rebel and a waffle cone with rainbow sherbert and black cherry. The crepe was very delicious and the thrifty ice cream tasted just as I remember.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the treats were excellent! We will be returning.

    "text": "Well, after waiting months for it to open, I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the freshness and quality are great for the price, but it still is a bit lacking. It really wasn't enough of a \"breakfast/lunch\" type menu. No meats really, everything is virtually cold. Most of the items are a \"build your own\" option, and if not guided by an employee, the finished products can be boring.    Ordered: *Bananas with Waffle. It was just that. Plain but fresh. Should have added ice cream or whipped cream.  *Crepe with Apples, Almonds & Caramel Sauce. Caramel was runny, and settled in the bottom of the cone, leaving the rest dry. But fresh none the less. * Chocolate Chip Waffle with ice cream & Bananas Foster Crepe.   Suggestions & Comments: - Need real utensils. Eating waffles with plastic forks is not good.  - Some food just needs to be warm. The crepes are cold, fillings and fruit are cold... maybe get a griddle or electric skillet, or even a microwave to eat toppings. An offering of meat toppings would be good too. Eggs, sausage, bacon, etc...  - Offer a plated crepe option so they can be eaten more evenly. - Food is messy. add napkins/holders/wetnaps on each table.  - Employees need to suggest items or give samples. Several customers came in, read the menu, and then left. :(  Overal, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon unless they're are some BIG changes. I do appreciate the freshness and quality for the price. I'd happily bring my vegetarian toddler here for a quality treat afterschool. And that is a good thing :) better to take the kids hear then just about every local fast food joint.",

    "text": "What a waste of time. I was in town, visiting with my sister and wanted to grab a quick snack. So I found a Groupon deal that read $7 for two waffles/crepe. With that said, you would presume that meant what it's stated. $7 for 2 (TWO) Waffles or Crepe. But nope, they take the cost displayed per item, which was about $5 - $6 per waffle/ or crepe. And then ended up ordering a mocha and a bottle of water. The total came out to be $25 (which the cashier subtracted $7), the total being $18. So not only did Groupon charge me $7 but the place charged me $18. I paid a total of $25 for two crepes/waffles and two beverages, which is the original cost. The cashier said he already took the deal into account. SO basically, there is no deal.   It's really deceptive advertising, and I'm a marketer myself. You don't lie like that. Crepe Shack & Waffles you should be ashamed of yourself!",

The cashier provided us with an explanation of the different, Japanese-style crepes as compared to what is traditionally found in this country.  I was in the mood for green tea ice cream and ordered the East meets West crepe which included red beans and motchi along with the green tea ice cream.  My wife ordered a berry, chocolate concoction.  Both crepes were tasty, although, certainly different than the crepes we were used to.  I would come back again and try their waffles or their crepes again if I am in the mood for a light snack.",

Definitely could of served two with the waffle.   We went on a cloudy day around 4:30 so it was pretty quiet.   Prices pretty reasonable and spent $22.05 for 4.

Crepes are not too crispy which can cause it to break and your toppings fall out so it's a good thing. It was almost sponge cake like for such a thin sheet. Toppings and crepes themselves were not too sweet. I believe they use fresh whip cream. Everything balanced out well.   You can build your own or order from their menu creations.   What we ordered:  Plain waffle w/ whip cream on the side  Plain crepe w/ cheese cake bites and whip cream  Rock at the road crepe which had marshmallows, almonds and white chocolate syrup and choice of ice cream, we got chocolate (rocky road cream inspired)  Revel crepe w/ strawberries, bananas, Nutella and whip cream and choice of ice cream, we got vanilla",

These are the Japanese version of crepes where you'll basically receive the crepe as if it's an ice cream cone. Speaking of ice cream cones, you can also get Thrifty ice cream on top! But no offense, I've never been impressed with Thrifty. I just like the idea of ice cream with my crepe.  I didn't get the ice cream, though, because I don't like how high the messiness potential is when you're holding such a thin crepe with ice cream in a piece of wax paper. I would prefer to get it on a plate or something. But like I said, I got a crepe with Nutella and strawberries, topped with whip cream (pretty sure it was reddi whip). You can't really go wrong with that, so obviously I'm going to say it was exactly what I expected and it was good because it was.  If I come back and order something else, I'll update the review. I'm not seeing that happening any time soon, but you never know--I just might crave some crepes one day.",

    "text": "Holy crepe! I love this place. So much so that I went two days in a row. The crepes are delicious, the people are cool, and the crepes are delicious!  I didn't really know what \"Japanese Crepe\" meant, but I am all in. They explained that the batter is less eggy and this results in a crepe that kind of tastes like a fortune cookie. I'd have to agree. On my first visit, I went with the Strawberry Sensation (strawberries/cheesecake/strawberry syrup) with strawberry ice cream. Yum! The next day, I went with the Rebel Special (strawberry/banana/nutella) with green tea ice cream. This combination didn't match the previous day, but it was still good. The crepe is rolled into what resembles an ice cream cone. So with the scoop of ice cream in there, it basically feels like you are eating an ice cream cone.  Make sure you check in on your Yelp app to get 10% off your crepe. Make sure to also get your punch card to get your tenth one free. I usually don't fill up punch cards, but I can see this place getting repeat visits from me, despite how far south it is located.  I haven't tried their waffles and I probably never will. But for a delicious crepe snack/dessert, five stars all the way!",

    "text": "Few places have pushed me to update, and none have received a second update, except for the Crepe Shack. Hearing from the owner, himself, about the new waffle batter, it was only right to go in to check it out. The edges were crispy and the center was spongy. The batter was delicious by itself. The taste and consistency is close to the waffles that I ate while in Asia. If you want something simple and classic ask for it with cinnamon, a dusting of powder sugar, and some maple syrup on the side.   Their crepes might be what draws me in, but the food talk is what has me constantly coming back. It is refreshing to see people who show pride in what they do. The enthusiasm that they show in striving to produce the best product is a draw. It would be easy to just cut up everything ahead of time or make a fruit preserve, instead they use all fresh produce and prep as they go. I also like how Li acknowledges the new crepe joint, but sees that they each have their own unique niche.",

    "text": "We were in the area and I was feeling on a snack and saw some of my Yelp friends check into the Crepe Shack so I decided to get crepe-y and be creepy.   I didn't find my friends, but I found some treats to fill in the need for a afternoon snack.   I got the East Meets West: red bean, mochi bits, condensed milk and green tea ice cream. I forgot how messy Japanese crepes was, but it was fun eating it. The flavors all went really well together and the crepe was good. It's a little less crisp than some of the crepe places I like (like Sophies in SFO), but good flavor and chewy.  The BF is more of a waffle person so he got a Bananas Foster: bananas, cinnamon powder, caramel, whip cream, ice cream. It was good toppings, but since they are using the crepe batter the texture is less than ideal. It was dense and wasn't crispy enough. The BF thinks next time he will order a crepe instead since that wasn't what he looks for in a waffle.   The staff is really friendly. The owner was the one who rang us up and saw my Yelp check-in offer and asked about how often I used it, asked what I thought of the crepe, etc. Seems like the type of owner who is responsive to customers feedback. They're fairly new, but it seems they are getting into a groove.  We live way across town, but definitely a place I can see myself stopping by again when we're in the area.",

I couldn't decide on which crepe to try so I actually had a custom made crepe with bananas, strawberries, blackberries, cheesecake bits, and vanilla ice cream. It was sooo yummy!! I usually don't like ridiculously sweet desserts, but this was perfect. The owners were really friendly too. They explained the concept of the Japanese style crepe as soon as I came in. They also made me an ice coffee, which wasn't on the menu.    I would definitely come back for an evening snack/ dessert. Highly recommend this place!",

Nice crunch on the outer crust while soft and fluffy inside, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a waffle. It also came with softened butter, syrup, and powdered sugar! Sandra also offered whipped cream, but I opted not to so I could focus on the waffle. If you can't decide between the crepes and waffle, I would still go with the crepe just because I haven't tried any as good as here! I would of given the waffle 4 stars, but Sandra and her boyfriend are so friendly, so 5 stars again!",

As I came in, I smelled something wonderful & sweet. Even though I was kind of full from eating at Montesano's Italian Eateria nearby, my stomach got excited again & my mouth started watering w/ the aroma. I got such a bad sweet tooth.  The place was so clean & had that cute modern look. Very friendly staff. Very reasonably priced. There were so many options on the menu. Everything sounded good. We ended w/ the Cookie Monster, Banana Foster & the Elvis crepes w/ vanilla ice cream. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cookie monster was my favorite. It was like eating that Half Baked ice cream by Ben & Jerry's but 100x's better. OMFG! I seriously want to come back again today. I'm in love. It's my first time having a crepe in shape of a cone w/ ice cream. I can't believe I've been missing out all this time. So thankful for my sister's pregnancy cravings. Next time I'm going to try either the Rebel or Tickle me Berry w/ the green tea ice cream. The Maui Fever sounds good too. I'm so excited for my next visit!",

Other than the blah-ness of the crepes, everything else was good. The portion sizes were decent, the space was open and very clean. The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was bright and inviting. FYI: The waffle batter was better than the crepe's.",

    "text": "REALLLLLLY!!!! Finally!  Japanese style crepes in Vegas?!?!?  For those of you who are so loveable that you have read my reviews in other states, you know I have a thing for hand held crepes.  My favorite place is Sophie's in San Francisco's Japantown, a place I went daily on my most recent Bay Area vacation (I posted a pic with my review of my eating the coveted green tea ice cream red bean paste matcha sauce crepe).  Then last summer in Seattle, I made my co-vacationers go to a mall just so I could try Unicone.  Needless to say, I had no idea based on the picture on yelp that the crepes would be hand held.  I just went because I knew it would at least smell good in a place that makes crepes and waffles!  Heading in there today, I learned that Crepe Shack opened 3 days ago.  Owner Li is a young entrepreneur with a big colorful space and lots of restaurant experience.  We talked at length about the business idea, his support of other new businesses and food trucks, and sushi (because we all love it mmm).  He is working out supplier issues so more toppings and ice cream flavors are to come, but for now, there is still a great selection.  I enjoyed a crepe with fresh strawberries and kiwi, shredded coconut, and almonds.  It was a really good treat, sweet and tasted healthy.  Li told me the batter is meant to taste fortune-cookie-esque, and it did.  This is a really fun place for a \"healthy sweet tooth\" craving.  If you track me down at the Yelp Seats kickoff on Tuesday, Li gave me a stack of 15% off cards that I can hand out!  Bon appetit!",

Every time we visited, the place was very clean and the staff- very friendly.

I first had the East Meets West waffle which came with red bean paste, mochi bites, condensed milk, syrup, whipped cream and my choice of green tea ice cream. It looked incredible and tasted so dreamy. Another time, I had the Rebel Special waffle with bananas, strawberries, Nutella, syrup, whipped cream and my choice of chocolate ice cream. This was a real classic, on steroids!!!   Their yogurt parfaits have just the right balance of sweet and sour with a whole lotta freshness while their cone crepes are made super thin as the perfect vessel for ice cream and other heavenly goodness.

Unfortunately, it was just a waffle with toppings, nothing special about it. It could be made at home, and for me anything that can be made at home I won't spend another $1 on. I heard the place closed and reopened with a new name & improved recipes. That will definitely be a stop my next time in Vegas.",

They are more fresh and are softer.  After speaking to the new manager, he mentioned more products will be introduced and I'm actually looking forward to seeing it. We'll have more variety for desserts but he'll be keeping the Thrifty ice cream, which we all like. Can't wait for the new products!!",

I had a \"Rebel Special\" (strawberries, bananas, and Nutella) crepe with vanilla ice cream and it was creamy and Nutella-y with a little fruity-ness mixed in. I really enjoyed the crepe-as-a-cone thing because it's different, the crepe is still slightly warm when you get it and it's soft which is the opposite of how cones usually are.   I definitely see myself coming back and meeting friends here for a treat. The price is pretty fair and the ice cream crepes are good.",

    "text": "Crepe Shack & Waffles is always an option for us when we're looking for dessert or something sweet. The crepes and waffles are executed consistently every time we've come in and with the infinite combinations, they'll always be something to find that's pleasing.  Located on the southwest corner of Eastern and Coronado, it's easy to find and you'll enter a spacious area with plenty of seating inside and a few tables outside. The menu consists of combinations that you can choose to have a freshly made crepe or a waffle as your vehicle to hold your toppings. I prefer the waffle over the crepe for the added texture factor and less messy factor. Top it off with a scoop of Thrifty's ice cream, and you're golden.  I've tried about three or four of the creations and I really like the Camp Out Smore topped with a scoop of chocolate malt crunch which is my favorite Thrifty flavor. The chocolate flavors with the crunchy waffle and graham crackers with the sweetness of the whipped cream and marshmallows just goes together well with me. The rest of the family usually goes for crepes with some kind of fresh fruit combination.  Prices are fair and depending on how much you add on, a crepe or waffle will run you between $5-$7. We've never really had any issues with service as the employees are willing to help you out if it's your first time or answer any questions. They've got the technique pretty down pat and can bust out a waffle or crepe in a couple of minutes. If you choose to hang out, you can grab a board game whoop everyone's butt in Sorry just like I did.",

They had just announced the limited edition Pumpkin Spice Crepe not too long ago. We thought it would taste average but it was extremely sweet. I tried the Camp Smore Crepe, which was packed with marshmallows and graham crackers. If you like Crepes, then this is the place for you. Check it out.",

They have a large selection of different flavor combinations, but you can also customize your own.  We shared the rebel which had strawberry, bananas, whipped cream and nutella with an ice cream of our choice (we picked vanilla) wrapped inside a crepe that was folded into a cone shape.  On its own the ice cream is nothing special, but when mixed with everything else it becomes something very yummy.  The nutella made it something I would crave again because nutella is basically liquid crack.  I actually would ask for them to add extra nutella next time because they were a little light on the application of it.    The man behind the counter was very patient and helpful, and they made it quickly after we put our order in.  If it is your first time you can get 10 percent off with a yelp check in. There is a good amount of seating inside, but we took ours to go.",

The staff is friendly and the establishment is quite big and a good area to study or catch up with friends as you enjoy your crepe.   Their crepes are delectable. They are Japanese style crepes, where they are wrapped up like a cone and you eat it without utensils (but you can if you really need to). My personal favorite is the East Meets West; it is a crepe filled with red bean paste, mochi, and condensed milk and I like to get green tea ice cream and whipped cream on top. The red bean paste is tasty and smooth and is complemented by the chewiness of the mochi; the condensed milk adds a slight but subtle sweetness to the entire dessert.   Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back time and time again!",

When I got here, the place was empty. We were the only ones here! For a place with such great reviews, I'm surprised there was no one here.   This Korean guy came out to take our order. I have to say the customer service was definitely lacking. He did not look enthusiastic at all. He just stood there while we were trying to figure out what to order. He didn't really make suggestions or offer any \"popular\" menu items. He just stood there and stared at us. It was kinda awkward. Once we finally ordered, I was surprised at how expensive it was. But I figured, it must be good!   Once the waffle cones and crepe cones came out, I was a bit disappointed that my order didn't look like the one pictured on the screen. It looked so nice and tempting on the display, but in person, the toppings were lacking and not as appealing. The crepe was unique and I liked it as a cone, but it was soft, not crispy. The ice cream was...well, ice cream. Nothing too special. It's definitely not what I'd thought it would be from reading the reviews!",

I'm sure the weather and the end of the school year factor played big parts, but maybe there was some spillover from a nearby dessert shop that had an unbelievably huge response to its free ice cream sandwich promo. My friend and I were in that latter group.  Neither of us were actually feeling too hungry, so we agreed to share a crepe ($5.50), although in hindsight a waffle ($6.95) would have been easier to split. We ended up taking turns holding the crepe and biting into it, which I suppose is how they want you to eat it (plus or minus the sharing). Maybe I should get tested for cooties soon.  Anyway, our choice was the strawberry sensation, which comes with slices of strawberry, little cubes of cheesecake, strawberry syrup, and a choice of ice cream (we did chocolate malted krunch, one of the flavors of the Thrifty ice cream carried here) and whipped cream (we skipped this). The crepe was thin and chewy, so props for cooking it right despite the pressure during the rush and the likely fatigue at the end of the shift. The strawberry was fresh. The cheesecake cubes were fun. The syrup was standard. The ice cream was as good as you'd expect.  I enjoyed Crepe Shack & Waffles, and it was nice to check another place off my seemingly endless list of yet-to-be-visited food places. It seemed a tad pricey, but I'll definitely consider returning for a delicious dessert if I'm in the area for restaurants or whatnot in the future.",

    "text": "What a lucky find to stumble upon before having dinner at Duzan next door. While we had dinner we looked up the menu and found that the crepes are Japanese style. I'm glad that I knew this going in since Japanese crepes and French crepes are a bit different. Both are good!  The menu is large for a shop specializing in crepes and waffles. There are about 20 flavor combinations that combine fruits, sauces, nuts, and other ingredients for yummy combinations. These combinations can be put inside of a crepe or on top of a waffle. Every combination includes a scoop of ice cream and there are about 20 Thrifty ice cream flavors to choose from. For people that are more creative there is also an option to create your own from the ingredients list. The shop also offers ice cream scoops, sundaes, shakes, and floats. Everyone in the group will find a sweet treat to enjoy here.  I had the Camp Out S'more in a Crepe with Coffee Ice Cream. The crepe is folded like an ice cream cone to hold all of the toppings which makes it easy to enjoy. The crepe looks hard in the photo, but is actually tender and chewy. Somehow it holds everything in, but has a very nice texture.   My husband had the Cookie Monster on a Waffle with Cookie n Cream Ice Cream. He said it was one of the best desserts he's ever had. I tasted it and agreed that the combination was delicious. The peanut butter, Oreo, and cookie dough combination on the waffle was fantastic.  The shop is large and open with many seats available. There are even board games available for those that want to hang out for awhile.",

This was my first \"Japanese style crepe\" and it certainly won't be my last.  I ordered the Bananas Foster (brown sugar, cinnamon, banana and caramel) with vanilla ice cream that was recommended to me by the staff.  I enjoyed it so much that the second time I visited, I ordered the same thing.   I was impressed that the young staff working there seemed so interested and invested in their jobs. They were very friendly and took the time to explain the menu, answer any questions and make recommendations.  So happy to have found a new and interesting place to take my out of town guests to. Looking forward to returning and trying some other favors and perhaps a waffle.",

Instead, I've just gotten to the point where I insist on taking away everyone's \"Crepe Virginity\", and in turn, they all become just as obsessed as I do. In the past two weeks, I have convinced at least 80 percent of my coworkers to try Crepe Shack, and all of them have loved it as much as I do. Truly, what's not to love?  After two months of being home and going to the Crepe Shack on a bi-weekly basis, I still can find no fault in their crepes. Still fluffy, delicious, and guilt-free with that serving of fruit (which seems to get larger every time I come in), crepes are the new cupcake, and with Crepe Shack around, I hope that it is a culinary endeavor that will never die out. I've tried to branch out and try most of the crepes, but I always stick with my favorites: Tickle Me Berry and Make Me Swirl.   The best part are the owners and staff - so incredibly friendly. It always makes me smile when an establishment recites your order as your approach the register - done so many times when I'm with my friends with their dead-set orders. A lot of times, I tend to loiter Crepe Shack for an hour after the crepes are gone, but I never receive a dirty glance or any sort of discomfort for it.   I have so much love for Crepe Shack - it is perhaps one of the best things to happen to Vegas ever since I left for school. When I go back, I know that this will be the one place I will miss the most.",

Since we were full from a 4th of July party we decided to share one crepe which proved to be more than enough for the two of us. I ordered the Rebel Special without ice cream, which meant that I got more fruit. I really liked the crepe itself without all the filling.....which you can actually order! Next time I'll order my own crepe with the fillings that I want. A pretty cool concept and pretty good dessert.",

I had to go back up and advise my ice cream was missing, I gues they guy thought i was ordering a palin crepe with ice cream to the side which is odd since my flavor and my husbands was different. The did fix it at no charge which i thought was nice. I think due to the volume maybe that was the cause of the mistake.

After reading the reviews on Yelp we desperately needed something to put a smile on our faces.  After walking in I noticed the simplicity of interior of the place.  We stared at the electronic menu and were immediately asked if we had been there before by an attentive employee.  She briefed us on what we could expect.  I ordered up \"The Elvis\" which consisted of ice cream, peanut butter, bananas with honey.  I then sat back and enjoyed the symphony of movement behind the counter.    One employee poured the crepe batter on a round griddle and then spun the mixture around as if she was raking a zen garden.  The other employee cut and began dicing to perfection my banana just I had seen him do with the other fruits before mine.  Once all the ingredients were placed together the crepe was then rolled into the shape of a cone.  Being the messy eater that I am I requested a fork and one was produced from behind the counter.  Even thought the preparation may be slow, I think that deliberate is a more appropriate term.  The presentation is simply elegant and the taste was pretty damn good.  It not a question of if I will return it's only a matter of when.....and wether I decided to make a next crepe cone a healthy one.",

The pop of colors on the walls definitely adds to the clean look and simplicity of the place, which for me, is great. The crepes are always made fresh and fast which I like because not everyone has the time to stay to eat and chat.   For me, I get my crepe and head on out the door. If you plan on staying and eating your crepes, you can play board games like Uno, Battleship, and they also have Jenga. Beware: the games are sticky because people like to eat and play at the same time!  Definitely a great place to visit! They need to open up a second location ASAP!",

I got the Rebel Crepe (Bananna, Strawberries and Nutella) with birthday cake ice cream and fresh whip cream.

Tonight I'm trying the cookie monster with added raspberries and raspberry sherbet. Wow was this good. But a bad idea to eat this in place of dinner because I was left with a sugar high and a tummy ache. Next time I'll share this one and have it as desert. Definitely an awesome eat though. I crave this place literally everyday that I have to fight myself not to drive anywhere near the intersection. Everyone there is so nice and patiently waits while you contemplate what to order since there are soo many choices.  TIP: Use your yelp check-in offers and look out for coupons in the mail.",

This style, the crepe is more to hold the ice cream and whatever else you order in. The waffle was pretty solid. I'd definitely order the waffle over the crepe. What I thought was cool was that they've a small selection of old-school board games on a shelf so they obviously don't mind people hanging out there for a bit.",

But I had recently tried them in California, so I was open to what Vegas had to offer. I recently just moved from Beverly Hills so I was happy when I found a crepe place at my convenience. I stopped by Crepe Shack & Waffles on thursday and can I just say that those crepes are to die for! It's one of my new favorite dessert places. Yogurtland doesn't even compare! I will definitely be back for more. The guy at the cashier was not only cute but very helpful when I was trying to decide what to order. I definitely recommend creating your own masterpiece, so that you can have whatever you want! My friend got the Rebel Special which was also very good! People!!! don't knock the japanese crepe, till you try it. Also realize that you can get an entire meal/dessert out of one crepe and it doesn't have to be savory!!! Definitely worth the price they charge, i actually think they should be more expensive considering the quality, service and location.  KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING! I LOVE THOSEEE CREPES!~",

    "text": "All right, so this place is trying to go with the Japanese Crepe style ... well i lived in Japan for almost 10 years so I am going to critique this to the best of my knowledge and experience. Crepes (especially japanese style that is everywhere around Tokyo) was one of my favorite desserts as a child, so when I went there I was so excited that someone finally started a similar business!  First off good job on the selections, I like the fact that they have lots of choices of ice cream and toppings/extras. Kind of like all the yogurt places but it definitely works for this also. But the CREPE!!! the crepe is my favorite part, but you have not come up to my standards. The crepe has no flavor but just white.. what .. flour? there's no brown ish carmel color of cooked dough with the egg batter taste. The crepe is .. too sad. So upset i was that when i go, i just get the waffles. I'm not the expert in waffles so it was a bit better than crepes. but even the waffles are a bit plain... the waffle ice cream sandwich at the \"LunchBox\" is Way better.. Sorry! And I think the decorative manner of the food still needs a bit work with nutella and peanutbutter coming out as tubes looking like tooth paste. haha. But as a customer, as long as you know what toppings goes well with what type of ice cream, you're in it for a treat. I'll go back even if its not as good as the ones in Japan.  I gave three stars because of the batter for crepe, waffles, style of food presentation, and okay service.",

The shop is pretty minimal, with pastels on the wall and menus on flatscreens.  I think people are tired of climbing up on ladders to change prices.  You can make your own crepe (with high number of combinations possible), or pick one of the combos.  I'm not a fan of many berries, so I partook in the Classic with a scoop of Green Tea ice cream.  Keep in mind that crepes do take a while to come out, but it's being made right in front of you: the batter is spread and cooked, the fruit is peeled and chopped, the ice cream is scooped, and the entire thing rolled up in a cone.  It's placed in a paper cone as well, but keep in mind it's a warm treat with ice cream in it.  Melt will happen.  Although I don't agree with David S that the crepe made me jizz in my pants, it was wholesomely good.  If you've never had green tea ice cream before, you're missing out.  It's vaguely sweet, with the undertone of tea that contrasts the sweet with its slight bitterness.  The classic already had nutella and bananas in it, so that's enough sweet for me.  Check in on Yelp and you will get 10% off, but be kind and drop at least that much in the tip jar.  The folks that work here are very warm and friendly, and it's not the easiest thing to make.  Never had a waffle here, but why would you have one when you can get a crepe?!  What's your cost for this exotic French treat? 5. 5 dollar.  5 dollar footlong.  It's ca-ca-ca-catching on.",

The place had fairly good foot traffic which was awesome considering it is a locally owned place. the only thing i thought was weird is they have real plates but plastic utensils.  Ill be back and have told my coworkers about it!",

The moment you walk in, you're taken away by the aroma's and smell of the crepes and waffles.  As for what to get, I'm sure everything is good.  It just depends if you're more in a savory dessert kick and want chocolate or if you're feeling fruity.  This place would get a solid 5 stars if they crisp'ed their crepes and waffles.  It would definitely add to the textural bite and overall dessert eating experience.  It also looks better appearance-wise..For those who have been to Genki Crepes in SF know what im talken about.  Since I dont know of any other Japanese Crepe places in Vegas, you should definitely check this place out.   THis place has lots of promis and I can see this in the Yelp Trending very soon if it is not already.",

    "text": "I had heard from David S. that their waffle batter had been revamped to be much lighter and crispier.  Since I was jonesing to fulfill my addiction anyway, Aziz B. and I made a stop on our way to the movies on a Friday night. I had just the plain waffle with some powdered sugar and a side of syrup. It was very crispy, light, and delicious--a huge change from the previous way it was made. Aziz B. had his waffle Berry Sensation style, and it was so good that I ate almost half of his. The fruit is a nice balance to the not-that-sweet, eggy taste of the waffle. I was told it's more of a Hong Kong style of waffle--referring to the eggier taste, which I think is great because I've honestly never had a Hong Kong style waffle before that night. My next visits will totally be waffle-fied, because I'm just as crazy about waffles as I am about crepes in cones!",

By this point I was good and ready for some tasty and delicious crepes. I was licking my lips looking at the choices, and Elite Emily and Hec were anxiously awaiting their crepes.  I selected the Camp Fire Smore crepe: a crepe with chocolate, marshmallows, and graham cracker bits. Nom nom no--- what? What did you ask me? What kind of ice cream did I want with that? Uh, chocolate malted crunch, I guess. Wow, crepes AND ice cream! Bonus!!!  But it wasn't until Elite Emily got her Strawberry Sensation that it hit me... the crepe was large, and rolled up like an ice cream cone, which was useful, since the ice cream sat in the middle, and the Smore part topped the ice cream. It was basically a giant, soft, ice cream cone.  Oh... that came out of nowhere.  So, apparently, that's the Japanese style of crepe. (Should have known, with Elite Emily's love of everything Asian.) I had no idea. I was expecting more along the lines of a breakfast crepe.  I mean, it was good, don't get me wrong.  I just really had looked forward to a breakfast-type crepe.  Oh, crepe... I miss you...",

So creamy and soooooo good. He got something called the Elvis Crepe (?). He said he really liked the \"guts\" of the crepe, but the crepe itself was cardboard-y. Maybe it was cooked a bit too long? It wasn't moist enough. (He's also from France, so he's had the best of the best when it comes to crepes.)  The staff was so friendly and the service was quick. We'll definitely be back!",

The place is clean and bright; there are tables and board games inviting you to stay and enjoy your dessert. The staff is friendly and efficient at getting you your treats in record time. You can even watch them make the crepes right in front of you.    On my first visit I had the Rebel Special - strawberries, banana, and Nutella - how can  you go wrong? I chose to have vanilla ice cream on mine and was not disappointed. The crepe was light and a perfect compliment to the filling. My husband had the bananas foster - banana, brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel - my only wish was that the filling was warm.   On our next visit I was craving apple pie, did I mention I was nine months pregnant? They had the perfect solution, the apple a la mode - apple, sugar, cinnamon, caramel, and graham cracker. It was almost like a slice of pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Again, I wished that the filling was warm, but it definitely hit the spot and quelled my pregnancy craving.   I am excited to try out some of the other combinations, I get the feeling you can't go wrong. I love that you can easily eat them without utensils, you just bite right in.

You can get fruit, yogurt, cookies, different syrups, ice cream and even cookie dough bites on either a giant waffle or inside a handmade Japanese style crepe! I highly recommend this place for anyone with a sweet tooth!",

Crepes have obsoleted cones in my mind for ice cream containing purposes. Crepes are the future.   This place is clean and well run. I ordered an Elvis and my girl got an apple caramel one, both with vanilla ice cream, both delicious. This little dessert stop prolly played a role in getting me some bedroom attention later on in the evening, so I'm gonna throw in an extra star for making me seem like a romantic.   Thanks place. I recommend this little spot to anyone who's into ice cream, give crepes a try and i promise you'll like it.",

    "text": "The only complaint I can think of for Crepe Shack & Waffles is that they don't have a location closer to home. It would be so dangerous for them to open up shop next to UNLV -- perfect group to target! I would have trouble resisting very frequent visits, lol  Everyone loves stamp cards and Crepe Shack offers them! I am almost finished filling up mine. I believe it's the standard \"buy 10 and the 11th is free!\" deal.  Also, if you're keen on text message coupons, Crepe Shack also has a text message line you can join. They offer a deal at least twice a month, from what I've noticed. I've seen \"rainy day specials\" and other cute deals of the sort. It's usually a 10% discount on your order. I would definitely take advantage of the deals more often if I lived closer,  I usually order the \"Rebel Special\" crepe, which comes with strawberries, bananas, your choice of ice cream, whipped cream, and the game changer - Nutella. Absolute heaven.  *Insert angelical chorus here*  Maybe they should experiment with green tea, like green tea crepes, or something. This seems like the perfect setting for that kind of innovation. They have lots of creative menu items, like \"Bananas Foster\" and such.  A trip to Crepe Shack & Waffles is always a good trip made, indeed. Can't wait for my next visit!",

Thank God for Crepe Shack, this is my new go-to spot for yummy dessert!   I had the Strawberry Sensation w/ Nutella. OMG.... it was just right, and satisfied my sweet tooth craving. I went with two friends, it was their first time here too. After dinner for some reason, we started talking about crepes. We were on a MISSION to Crepe Shack. We were all so happy that we decided on this.   The customer service was AMAZING! The girl who was helping us was kind, sweet and helpful. She asked us if this was our first time, and explained what it is and their menu and flavors.  I was so happy about this, b/c at the last dessert place (cupcakes) I went to a few days ago I had a BAD first time experience. But this place did the opposite and we were able to enjoy and savor the crepes we were eating. :)    The place looked cleaned and was very spacious. And for some reason my artistic eye loves the type of purple they used to paint the walls! haha. random like, but yes ambiance is a factor for me. I'll definitely be back! Excited to try the other combinations. :)",

I tried the Strawberrry Sensation and wifey got the Rebel Special....  While waiting for our order, the crowd kept getting bigger and the three people making everyone's orders  seemed to get kinda nervous, probably because the crepes and waffles weren't coming out as fast as people were coming in...here's why:  -one person was cooking the crepe  -one person was assembling the crepe  -one person was waiting with a scoop of ice cream to finish the crepe  We finally got our orders, and the verdict??? Great concept, but tastewise just okay. I guess I'm a purist when it comes to crepes being that I've crepe'd well over a hundred times, including the crepe joint in Japantown SF....It was a little too thick for my liking and the vanilla extract was pretty strong.  Execution could use some refining as well...three people should be able to knock out three orders, just like the homeboys at Pier 39 in San Francisco do with  style and finesse, especially if there are more people are coming in, and also now that there's some crepe competition nearby...ALOHA!!!",

I remembered that this place was in the area and I've been dying to try it, so we stopped in for a little dessert.  My fella and I decided to share a Rebel Crepe (Japanese crepe filled with banana, strawberry, nutella and an ice cream of our choice - butter pecan). We got our order and started sharing! Everyone has described the flavor of the crepe as a little like a fortune cookie, but I would say it tastes more like a soft version of a sugar cone. Either way, it was delightful and not overly sweet. Since I prefer my desserts a little on the less sweet side, I probably would prefer this treat without the ice cream, but it did add a bit of interesting flavor punch to this dessert.   About halfway through sharing my fella decided he wanted his own dessert and ordered his next crepe with banana, strawberry and white chocolate. He loved this one even more. I wasn't able to finish my entire crepe, but so might be a great idea to share if you're not super super hungry.   All in all, great little dessert spot. I'd come back if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "After having a savory crepe at Suzuya, when I got home, my tummy was telling me \"Mike, it's time.. for a sweet one\". I thought to myself, \"Where is a place close to my house that sells crepes?\" And I remembered, CS&W. I jumped in my car, and went here ASAP!!  CS&W is located on Eastern, past Horizon Ridge, in the same complex as Trader Joe's and Sears. It's a new place that has been opened for less than 2 years and has been getting rave reviews on yelp.  Inside, the store is clean, really clean. It has a modern vibe, furthermore, it is bright and airy. The staff is very friendly, professional, but very approachable. After ordering, I sat down and waited. After about a few minutes, they brought my order to me.  Rebel Special Crepe - Strawberries, Nutella, Bananas. I added the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The crepe is more chewier than the ones at Suzuya or Crepe Expectations. It tasted O.K., just o.k. The nutella sauce they used was amazing. The bananas tasted good too. The whipped cream and Thrifty brand ice cream were very good. But, I do have a couple gripes. Now, I'm not a big fan of overly sweet desserts. But, IMO, this could have used some more sweetness. Also, the strawberries had little flavor. Maybe if they used Harry's berries, it could have been better. The crepe was a 3.  Classic Waffle - Nutella, Bananas, Toasted Almonds. This time I added whipped cream and Thrifty's Cookies and Cream Ice cream. They also put a side of pancake syrup in a small container for me. For my personal preference, I'm not really into soft waffles. But, even though it was soft, the waffle had really good flavor. The nutella sauce, bananas, ice cream, almonds, and whipped cream were very good. What really elevated the waffle was the pancake syrup. It provided the right amount of sweetness for this dish, and it tied all the flavors together. Without the syrup, like the crepe, it wouldn't have been sweet enough. A big 4 to 4.5 for this one.  I spent about 5 to 6 dollars for each item, it's a very good deal. I would recommend the waffle over the crepe, and I do urge you to get the pancake syrup and pour it on top before you eat it. That's my story and i'm sticking to it. Good day, sir.",

In addition, the crepes are amazing as well. This place sells \"Japanese style\" crepes which means the crepes and rolled into a \"cone\" shape and inside is filed with fresh fruits, toppings, ice cream, and whip cream.

The reason I had to try this place was the fact that they promote they have thrifty ice cream (which is one of my guilty pleasures!) To my surprise they have special blended thrifty ice cream flavors in addition to a few of the classic flavors.   The first time I came here I just had ice cream and enjoyed every bite. The second time I actually tried a crepe which was really good. I found it interesting that they make the crepe in front of you then fill it with ice creme and topping. The crepe then acts like a ice cream cone. :-) Another option they offer is a Belgian waffle that you can top with ice cream and other toppings. (I'm saving that option for when I have someone to share with.) If you have issues with making topping decisions the menu offers quite a few signature combos  that are sure to satisfy any taste bud cravings!     I will definitely be back when I sweet craving hits. Very tasty treat suitable for all ages!!! ;-)",

If you have never had Japanese crepes, they are served very thin and are in a cone shape for a hand held treat.  I always get the Rebel Special (love me some Nutella!).  My husband typically gets the Maui Fever.  Everything is really good though, never a complaint! As for decor, its a standard ice cream shop atmosphere.  They have board games for kids to play as well.  I just wish they would serve coffee!   *Get the punch card - every 10th crepe/waffle is free!*",

Apparently a Japanese trend now gaining popularity on both coasts and featuring a large, spacious, and modern look with friendly servers, myriad options, and great prices ($5 for a crepe cone, $6 for a topped waffle) this is definitely a trend I can support, though in an ideal situation a place doing such a thing with house-made ice creams and condiments would be all the more appealing - and to find that in Vegas I think the best option is a crepe and some ice cream or gelato at Jean-Philippe in the Bellagio at nearly twice the price.",

I must admit, the menu has a ton of different combinations of fruit and syrups and the crepes look delicious.

The gentleman who took our order was very nice and kindly explained that they offered Japanese-style crepes and waffles, how to order, and the popular combinations. I went with one of the popular specialty crepes - Bananas Foster with vanilla ice cream (love that they serve Thrifty!) and no whipped cream. Fresh bananas, brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel with the freshly-made crepe, so yummy!! I was very happy! My brother ordered the Nutty Buddha (hehe) which had peanut butter, bananas, and Nutella. The man was enjoying himself as well. I got a little messy since I wanted to save some of the ice cream for the bottom, but it didn't work so well haha. It was fun watching them make the crepes as well! I wish I got more photos, but they were too quick. Next time! Anyway, I checked in too late to use my 10% off check-in offer. Silly me.

I like that its a Japanese style crepe, which took me by surprise. They serve it to you in a cone, free from a plate, fork, and knife! Its made to eat on the go, wrapped in paper... and does NOT drip or run! I see some people don't like the paper wrapping or the way it's served...  all I have to say is embrace the culture!  The staff is super friendly, patient, and willing to help you out. I was asked if it was my first time, and they thoroughly explained everything. All crepes are made fresh, starting from the crepe, then they cut up fresh fruit in front of you (no pre-cut fruits here!!!). Ice cream and whipped cream are included, but you can replace your ice cream with an extra topping... if I comprehended correctly.   When it came to decision making I got the banana's foster with vanilla ice cream inside mmm mm mm. And my friend got \"one of the most popular\" Rebel ___ (I'm drawing a blank on what it was called!). Two great crepes for $10.50.  They were both jam packed with filling and there was no skimping out!! While we were enjoying, we were even asked if we wanted anymore sauces!!! I was perfectly content with my crepe... the best part was definitely the bottom where all the extra melting goodness mixed together, and I was definitely surprised it didn't drip from the bottom.  I will 100% be back ready to try another flavor!!!",

Sadly, Vegas is slow on food trends...forcing me to look at pictures (like this <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fh42u9L&s=06906d7a1d99e80cbc95318ce73ab4c04649c83dfd308c8f810b99ba7264dea7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/h42u9L</a> and this <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FftAs5D&s=b74ab6d4877aea77eeb3d3fb1d9466d51716b687ea6cf95c49e1405b54876b81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/ftAs5D</a>) of these crepes to satisfy my craving. Just in the nick of time before I was about to attempt to create my own Japanese crepe in my kitchen, Crepe Shack & Waffles popped up in my neighborhood next to my beloved Trader Joe's. And reading all the fabulous reviews, I knew I had to make a visit to this shop ASAP. With friend by my side, I visited Crepe Shack & Waffles for a sweet dinner treat.   The place is super clean and roomy with high ceilings, colorful walls & a minimalist feel. Perfectly designed to cater to the rush of high school students who come by this place after school and during the night to hang out. Plus 1 for free wi-fi!   Upon walking in, we were greeted by one of the workers who explained how the menu and ordering process worked. My friend and I both decided to order from the Specialty menu rather than the DIY menu, as the Specialty Crepes are a much better deal in terms of price. I chose the Tickle Me Berry (Strawberry, Raspberry & Blueberry) Specialty Crepe w/ Green Tea ice cream and no whipped cream, and w/ my Yelp discount I paid less than $5 for this wonderful cone of yumminess.   Owner Li and I started talking about his business, Yelp & such, while he was making my crepe. He told me that he wanted to make his crepe batter reminiscent in flavor to a fortune cookie with the addition of more vanilla,  compared to regular crepes which are more eggy in taste. Great decision! I'd much rather taste more vanilla than more egg. Anyways, after Li added fresh strawberries, blueberries & YELLOW raspberries (!) and a scoop of ice cream into my crepe, he rolled it up in a cone and handed me this piece of food art. Being a Japanese-crepe newbie, I thought the crepe was meant to be eaten w/ a fork at first, but then I realized \"utensils not required\" as it's meant to be eaten like how you would eat an ice cream cone.   I took my first bite and was impressed. The crepe itself was thin, soft, airy & slightly chewy all at the same time. The flavor of the crepe was sweet but not too sweet, the berries were fresh (I wanted more berries...) & the ice cream was just the right amount of sweetness. All these elements harmonized well with each other, resulting in a concoction that left my sweet tooth satisfied and not aching. I felt less guilty about eating this somehow. My favorite part of the crepe was the last bites before it disappeared, as the slightly melted ice cream combined w/ the remaining fruit and the crepe made for the last perfect bites.   I'll be back again with friends in the near future. Not just for the yummy crepes but for the friendly service as well. I hope this place sticks around for a while.",

    "text": "On a wonderful night out went to the Crepe Shack & Waffles to get dessert.  I have to say the place impressed me!  The decor inside the place is rather spartan but don't let that stop you from ordering one of the most delicious crepes you will have a chance to eat.  Since this was the first time I had been there I asked the staff what were some of the more popular flavors.  Then I ordered the Banana's Foster and my hubby ordered the Camp Out (basically a smore).  We both got the crepes filled with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  It was YUM!!!  The crepe was freshly made (right in front of me) and then filled with bananas, brown sugar, caramel sauce,  whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream.  Then the crepe is folded up into a cone.  Eating the crepe reminded me of eating a waffle cone but instead of a hard cone it was a soft, warm, yummy crepe!  If you have time go and check out the Crepe Shack!  It is in the same shopping center as K-Mart and Trader Joes on Easter.  The Crepe Shack its on the end of the shopping center and I recommend sitting outside if the weather is nice.  You have a good view of the city!  :D",

It was pretty late, but we were warmly greeted by the three guys behind the counter. One asked if we had been there before. Saying \"no\", he explained the concept to us and was very helpful in telling us about the different selections.  I ordered the Camp Out S'more with Birthday Cake ice cream. It was delicious. The crepe is huge, but rolled up and stuffed with all the goodies made it look less intimidating. The hubby ordered something with fruit, I think. I wasn't paying attention because I was enjoying mine too much, but I do know he liked what he got. After eating the entire thing, I was over-stuffed, but it was so worth it. They even followed up and asked how we liked our order.",
