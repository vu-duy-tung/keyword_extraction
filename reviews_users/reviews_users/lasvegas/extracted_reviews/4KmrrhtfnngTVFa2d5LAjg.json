Of course, she decided our table was ready - but gave us a \"go to hell\" look for burdening her.",

The service on this visit was excellent. The pizzas were average. I am not complaining about the prices because they are on par with what you would expect at the Wynn  but they are pretty high. I would go back for late night pizza if staying in the Wynn but wouldn't make a special trip.",

I always seek out macaroni and cheese when in a drunken haze, so was bummed when the menu didn't have it listed. Whether it was the adrenaline still coursing through my body or the alcohol, I insisted the waiter ask the chef if it would be possible to make macaroni and cheese. BOOM. Ask and you shall receive. And it was sooooo good. Totally legit 4 cheese macaroni with a baked top. The second night there, I once again asked the Allegro server for macaroni. He insisted it wasn't possible only to return from the kitchen saying, \"Been here 3 years and still learning new things.\" :). Have a feeling I'll definitely be back in the future!",

We had calamari and bruschetta for an appetizer (both good) and I had tuna (good, but a little too much salt and cream sauce on the veggies was kind of heavy).  Portion size was normal for the things we got, not too big, not too small.  Didn't get dessert because there was nothing that I especially like (and I generally like dessert).  So I don't know if they're good or bad, just nothing I wanted (no cannoli).  Service was pretty attentive, far better than average I'd say.

Had a reservation for dinner, when we approached the hostess stand she immediately barked out \"do you have a reservation\" not \"hello or good evening\". They were both rude and snobbish. We were seated and drink orders taken right away. We started out with a couple apps, and before we were finished, there was a busser that grabbed our plates before we were done. We felt rushed. I decided to order the lasagna. I have to be honest, Ive never ordered lasagna at a restaurant, to me it's like ordering spaghetti and meatballs, both you can easily make at home. Nothing on the menu really jumped out at me. The lasagana was good, but for $28, I really didn't think it was anything spectacular. Our server, Jamie was great, this was the reason I decided to give 3 stars instead of 2.  Food was ok, ambiance was ok. I don't see myself returning here.",

    "text": "Had an intimate dinner at Allegro and the Wynn Casino last night. The bread came out (literally) frozen, and we had to request \"warm\" bread.  The bean and arugula soup was delicious, but the portion size was massive (hence the $14 charge). It was a meal unto itself, seriously.  We ordered three Makers Mark Old Fashions, which were disappointingly prepared, and at $19.00 each, an insult. Someone needs to school the bartender that ginger ale is not simple syrup and that Old Fashions shouldn't be bubbly.  My spouse ordered minestrone soup and an ordinary arugula salad, both of which were decent, but unremarkable.  For my entree, I ordered the risotto pescatoro--or seafood risotto.  I had to send the entree back to the kitchen because it was too salty.  The chef came out and apologized, saying that the assistant chef had put too much lobster sauce in it, rendering it inedible.  The chef prepared a second order of seafood risotto which was much more to my liking--although the rice was a tad bit undercooked. The risotto did have a decent amount of shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops to justify the $37.00, but if you are going to offer risotto, then the rice should be perfectly cooked.  The two of us spend almost $200.00 for a dinner that was uninspired, disappointing, and sadly forgettable. The service was, however, attentive; and the ambiance was classy, but for this critic, quality food is paramount, especially when they are commanding such prices.",

My husband had it with spicy red sauce, and I asked for it with pink sauce (both had a little lemony taste). It was good at the time, BUT then I woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pain. I was kept up the entire night with diarrhea and vomiting. My husband had a little diarrhea but not as bad.  The Wynn ran out of rooms with 2 queen beds so my husband and I had to share a king bed with our 2 young kids which made the situation even more uncomfortable.  I was miserable and didn't feel well for the next day - sick/tired/exhausted.  I wanted to throw up every time we passed the smell of Italian food in the shops.  We had to leave Saturday (still not feeling completely normal) so this was not a good trip.",

The Wynn is a beautiful hotel, Allegro has very good food, but service at all Wynn restaurants were terrible.   From the very beginning the host(esses) profile you. If you are not in high end designer clothes you'll receive the condescending smirk to let you know you're not important. For someone who uses their work clothes for a wedding, funeral, or other like event, they are not making enough money to be a judge. In fact, a message to the staff at Allegro....You are all servers, you are expendable!!!  It took our server a very long time to come to the table. I can assume that when she saw we had kids she was thinking to herself, \"great, kids\". While I can appreciate that thought, my kids stay on their bottoms and keep their voices down. Before passing such judgment why not greet the table and get an impression?  Once our server made her way to us she tried hard to be cordial and hide her opinion. When she realized we weren't afraid to order from the menu she immediately perked up. Because the bill is high she knew at that point that he was going to get a good tip, so she tried harder. As a former server, I was offended by her reaction. I truly believe you appreciate the job you are in because there are plenty of people who would love to have your job.   Fortunately, the food was very good. My daughter had a pizza, and my other daughter a noodle dish. They were both delicious. I had clam linguini which was amazing and my wife had lasagna, equally good. Had it not been for the the initial greeting by all parties, the meal and experience would have been great. Because of the poor service from the host and server in an industry that relies on great service, Allegro earned itself 3 stars.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner last night as we were going to a show. It is Italian American and the best part of the night was the service. Our server, Sean, was just awesome. He was friendly and helpful and always on point. So, why only four stars? Note that the service gets five stars, and the majority of the food gets about 3 1/2 stars, so it averages to four stars. Here is why: we started off with appetizers and I ordered the mozzarella appetizer,  which came with four different types of mozzarella at $29 and we paid an extra six dollars for roasted bell peppers and another extra six dollars for olives to come with it. It was very yummy, but we thought very expensive for what we got. The kids both ordered a Caesar salad which looked good and was good. For entrees, one of the options was a pork with porcini mushrooms special for that night. It was roughly $39 per plate. It was not very good. I was surprised that that was considered a special for the night and would never order it again. What is nice is that one of the young kids at our table simply wanted pasta with chicken and they were able to accommodate easily for this, which I thought was great. Dessert is where this place shines: I had the vegan coconut tapioca with fruit and it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the cannolis and they were impressive. The tiramisu was also delicious. Dessert was a simple homerun. My friend and I both ordered a The Dream cocktail composed of fine champagne, St. Germain liquor, and hibiscus. Delicious! On the expensive side as $22 for small/average champagne flute serving, yet very good. To start, the bread basket that comes with the meal is incredible. It has amazing fresh bread with lovely spices, focaccia, and incredible Italian wafers/crackers. The ambience is nice and the seats are comfortable. It is a great location if you're going to see Le Reve as the walk is not even 10 seconds from the theater. It is on the moderate to expensive side, so if you are on a budget, be careful. My best suggestion is to stick to the pasta for your entree if you want a for sure phenomenal meal. They kids order pastas and they were all wonderful. We were less impressed with our meat dishes. We will definitely be coming back, but our orders will be different next time in terms of entrees.",

What's nice about this place is that they can usually accommodate you without a reservation and they're open very late.   You can also be as fancy as you want with your meal, or go with something casual like pizza. We've done both. They have a bar area where you can lounge and have drinks while watching TV and the location on the corner makes it a great meeting point with friends.  I love the lasagna rolls with proscuitto. Very creamy and flavorful. The pizza is big enough to split and is a great snack if you don't want to go too heavy.   The only downside is that I feel the servers are completely uninterested in their jobs. They don't go out of their way and are sometimes hard to locate.  But, four stars for convenience, menu, ambiance and location!",

They have penne pasta and a salmon main course under 500 calories. So those of you counting calories don't need to feel guilty eating out. This is also a great spot for Vegan's. The dining experience is so enjoyable as bartenders know their craft and servers are on point. Dinner and late night the menu doesn't change. Venture out, cheers!",

I guess we didn't look like we were important enough for our waiter to give good customer service. The waiter took our order never came back to refill drinks or check if we wanted anything. The service staff brought out food the bust boy refilled our drinks. When we finally caught up to the waiter to get our checks, he brought back on big check. We asked if he could split it, he told us to \"do the math ourselves \" one of my friends was nice enough to start it herself but I told her that's not her job. We got him to finally do it and he said it was going to be a wait. I  Will never return to that restaurant or refer anyone else to go. The food is not worth the price and doesn't give that real Italian feel or taste.",

Did enjoy the minestrone soup and my husband liked his caesar salad. Our server wasn't super attentive either. He came over the first time to 'greet' us and said \"do you know what you want?\". Other staff (people that brought out the bread etc were friendly). The spaghetti that came with my husband's chicken parmesan was good, so I ate that instead of the rigatoni. Waiter didn't ask how dinner meal was even though there was 95% of my rigatoni left. We had to stop him to ask for the bill. Quite a waste for $120",

Well  my last visit was very unfortunate it was about  5:00AM and after gambling  more than 8 hours plus at the Wynn a girl was very HANGRY... I was really in the mood for a good salad so I ordered the arugula salad and I had them add salmon ... Keep in mind that once I added the salmon this salad would cost $39.00 dollars which was totally fine by me since I was confident Allegro Chef would make me an amazing salad with a good salmon ohh how I was utterly disappointed the salmon tasted horrible and the salad was super bland .... we had also ordered a minestrone soup as a starter and that was also super bland it literally tasted like nothing...I was really let down that night and I wish the outcome would have been different because when I come back in two weeks, I will definitely not be going to Allegro",

They are skinny shoe string fries with the perfect amount of salt sprinkled on top. The pizza was a thin crust pizza with ur choice of topping. It was a good size for 2 people (possibly 3 if you do not eat too much).   Service is excellent as well. Waiters were attentive and constantly filled water and refilled drinks. Food did not take too long to come out either. It was nice to have a decent place to grab a late night snack after the club. Next time Im in town and at XS, I will defiantly return for my late night fix of fries and pizza!",

I mean, I guess the decor makes it upscale?  I came here with my girlfriend at 3AM. Seated quick, server was quick, service was quick. No complaints on that. My complaints are with the food and the prices. We're in Vegas, of course everything is going to be more expensive, but when the quality doesn't match the price, it's really hard to praise the place.   Pepperoni pizza and Rosemary Potatoes. So the pizza is as thin as a piece of paper. It was decent I guess. Honestly, I could've gotten a frozen pizza from the 99cent store and it would've tasted the same. The potatoes were tiny baby potatoes, maybe 10-12 pieces. They were just average and small potatoes with a hint of rosemary.   I'm sure Allegro has something decent on their menu, but I was definitely not impressed.",

We had worked long and hard all day on the two occasions that we visited so we wanted and needed something delicious yet reasonably priced and conveniently located within our hotel as we were dining into the later hours of the evening.  Good thing for us that Allegro is open all night until 6am!  When I originally checked reviews of this \"casual\" option within the Wynn, we were almost scared off with the amount of people that ordered \"pizza\" - we didn't necessarily want food that was uber casual and being from NYC/NJ, we certainly did not fly to Vegas for a flat-bread with high end cheese and sauce.  But guess what - it was delicious!  I didn't order it myself but on both occasions at least one of my coworkers ordered a flat-bread pizza and was extremely delighted!  On both nights I tried a slice of each and enjoyed both the meatball version as well as the Vegan with roasted veggies on top.  The first night I ordered the Amazing Fava Bean & Yellow Beet Salad to start and had the Veal Marsala for my entree.  A couple nights later I had the Arugula Salad along with the Mushroom Crusted Salmon.  I could probably eat here every night and be perfectly happy with this fresh, delicious food!  It all starts off with a beautiful bread basket and a white fava bean & garlic spread so don't miss out on trying that!!  The Banfi Chianti Classico is highly recommended but there are actually several wines on their list that are reasonably priced.    Definitely dine here at least once if you are staying in the Wynn and looking for an affordable but classy \"casual\" dinner option.",

I got a little worried though with all of the mixed reviews I had seen...  We started out with the calamari and Caesar salad, both of which were above average.  Similar to my experience at SW, a really tasty bread basket was brought to the table.  I ordered the lasagna, but requested to hold the pine nuts, the server said that unfortunately they are inside of the lasagna and cannot be removed.  I found this kind of strange, but I understand perhaps this dish is mass produced so I lived with it.  The lasagna was good and better than what I have had at Chicago Joe's or The M, but I would expect that for $10+ more!  It uninformatively wasn't worth the price and quality that I've had at other higher end Italian restaurants.  I did pull out a few pieces of hard fat/meat which is understandable because it wasn't ground beef, but obviously isn't a highlight of the meal.  Overall the setting is very nice, but I wish I could have spent that money at a higher-end experience.  For a measuring stick, I had a much better meal at Bootlegger Bistro with just a slightly more casual atmosphere for a lower price.",

I went here twice on my latest trip to Vegas-the food and people watching was that good. Their salads, pizzas and pastas were all delicious. The mushroom truffle pizza is by far my most favorite try-if you love pizza, and truffles/mushrooms, you will not be disappointed! Great place to see all the late night characters in the casino and such in the Wynn!",

The Escarole and Bean was tasty but nothing special for $13.  Arugula Salad (12) and Escarole and Bean Soup (13)  Entrees: We went with the Stracci Pasta (28) which is like torn pieces of flat pasta and Lentil Rigatoni (27) which had a really yummy filling which served well with the rigatoni.   Wine: $19 for a glass Red Wine, that seems a little crazy, especially considering I ordered at the bar just waiting for our seat.",

Went here last weekend for a late night dinner (2am-ish type dinner), ordered a ton of food with my friends, and it was incredible! They must have changed the menu, the chef, the recipes, something, because everything was excellent!!!  My 2 favs were the gnocci-OMG-off the chain-it was so good we ordered 2, and the truffle pizza-we ordered 2 of that also! WOW!   We also ordered the margarita pizza, the calamari, spaghetti, and....that's all I can remember. All were very good.   The place was packed at 2am-we waited about 20 minutes for our table, which is always a good sign:)  Will definitely come back here...great job for turning the restaurant around Steve Wynn-I'm a fan!!",

I had it 2 times in a row just to MAKE SURE it was really as bad as I believed it to be also it was the only available option at the Wynn at 5 am. Pasta noodles were literally out of the box and uncooked. I was chewing my pasta like it was crackers dipped in hidden valley grade Alfredo sauce. The tomato sauce on the pizza was extremely nasty,.. and it was baked over a cracker.. it didn't taste like pizza more like a bland attempt at caprese.   I also asked the waiter to give me a drink that would make me drunk,. What does he do? He takes an exact measurement of 1oz peach ciroc, adds OJ and charges me $30 plus tip.   Anyway, even if you're desperate just don't come here. Sleep it off.",

Second night was cooked a bit too rare, but they happily refired it to our liking. Only gripe was there were parts that were too chewy.  - Margherita pizza: 4 stars - crispy crust, hearty sauce. - Pappardelle wild boar ragu: 4 stars - LOVE pappardelle in general and their pasta was delish! Only grip was the meat had a weird taste to it. - Meatballs: 5 stars - SO many meatballs. We all couldn't get enough.  - Arugula/beet salad: 5 stars - I'm not much of a salad person usually, but the seestar wanted it and it was perfectly dressed and I tasty. - Minestrone soup: 4.5 stars - flavorful and super hot. Loved how the pasta was still pretty al dente considering the time... - Clams & mussels: 3 stars - not bad, but not good. Just meh. - Ricotta/ truffle pizza: 5 stars - super flavorful, loved the balance between the soft and sweet ricotta against the salty and crispy pizza crust. - Kale salad: 3 stars - not a fan of kale, so probably biased. - Lasagna: 4 stars - the pasta tasted similar to the pappardelle, which I LOVED - Eggplant parm: 3 stars - flavors were there, but the eggplant was over cooked to the point where it turned to mush.   - Side of mushroom: 5 stars - love mushrooms and love how they had a varietal if mushrooms  Overall, probably the classiest place you can dine at 5AM. Surprisingly delicious and everything was pretty cooked well considering the time.",

    "text": "Discretion is part of the management's role and especially the role of the manager. In this case the manager Alex and the hostess Kelce have not learned how to treat valued guest of the hotel. Not saying that just because we spend a ton of cash on 4 rooms and we spend tens of hours at the tables people should break the rules. As mentioned discretion is why a restaurant group hires a manager. In this case the manager and hostess refused us service due to bathing suit cover ups having tiny see through holes. Arms and legs were showing, nothing else. As I was with 2 women I felt a ashamed and embarrassed to hear the manager and hostess body shaming hotel guests. I would have though the female hostess would have heard herself and her regression of the female body, but sexism knows no gender. I have eating here before and I can tell you it not worth dealing with narrow minded help and mediocre food. Management will blame resturant policy, so the only way to stop this type of treatment of women is to boycott this establishment. When the restaurant close their policies will change and hopefully the next place to open will use better judgement when hiring staff.   I hope no one else has to endure this type of treatment when on an expensive vacation and especially after paying a resort fee for the priviledge of being discriminated.",

We ordered a greyhound and a beer, we got the bread basket which was filled with goodies, not basic stuff but interesting stuff that will make you like bread again.    Got the Carpaccio, was excellent.  Then we added the Caesar Salad.  We followed that up with the Lobster Mac N Cheese, and the Carbonara.  Both were excellent.  We were not worrying about the calories or anything as usual...these dishes were all decadent, to say the least.  We took most of the pasta away in boxes, we could barely eat any of it after the bread, salad and Carpaccio.  It was still good the next day!  Thanks fully we brought an ice chest since you can't use the refrigerators at the Wynn for anything other than their own mini bar stuff.    We actually sat at the bar on Friday of our stay as well, and had the Clams Casino, and the Calamari.  I think we went in because there was a Happy Hour?  I honestly can't remember, we were obviously drinking.  I have no idea what we spent or if it was a good deal.  But that goes to show, we had a good time!  The ambiance and the service, both visits, was excellent.",

I was quite surprised when these bite sized desserts appeared for the celebrants only...My parpadelle dish was average, but acceptable.  My husband's dish pasta fra diavolo was underwhelming, and over spiced.  My friend ordered the risotto special.  There were several mussels that were unopened (signaling they were not suitable to eat), and those that were opened had the mussels missing...Should we find ourselves in a position to eat at Wynn again, we will not go out of our way to eat at this restaurant, unless we stick to basics (pizza and salad).",

When we arrived for our 8:30 reservations, they were not busy and were sat right away.  I liked the decor a we were seated in the middle of the restaurant.   Our server made the meal that much better.  She was excellent at pointing out recommendations along with continually ensuring out experience was excellent.  We split a Caesar salad and my wife ordered Chicken Piccata and I went with the special of night, Seafood Risotto.  My wife said it was the best piccata she has eaten and I couldn't finish my risotto because it was so filling.  We really enjoyed Allegro and is a good alternative to Sinatra's (our favorite) if you're looking for Italian.",

This lady with short blonde hair, and glasses pretty much just stared at us fumble around trying to fit, not helping at all, just giving us looks. Finally, with an attitude, she grabbed another chair, and put it at the end of the table. It really ruined the mood.. Then, our server took 10 minutes to even come by and say hi. Our drinks weren't refilled. I had to even ask for a refill of water. The men, and women who delivered our food didn't smile at us or seemed friendly. So overall, pretty low quality service. If it weren't for the food, I would've rated 1 star.",

Like everything else at the Wynn Allegro is promoted as 5 star but in reality is more like 3. The food took FOREVER to come out. There was the price but there was also nothing to set Allegro apart from any other restaurant. Amazingly average in every regard as far as I can tell. Because everything is so average but priced like it's worth its weight in gold I doubt I will be returning. I doubt I will recommend this place to friends and family.",

We tried a couple of different pizzas (margarita and something else) and they were excellent too. Presentation was nice.  Decor - The place has slightly dim lighting, but I like that. Decor wise, it lives us to the Wynn standards. Nice place to relax.  Service - Excellent service. Our server was attentive and ensured that we had a great time.  Overall, this is a nice restaurant to eat at. Certainly try it if you're at Wynn. ( removed half a star due to the butternut Squash soup. Just ok)",

We decided to try several dishes by splitting each 4 ways - our own tasting menu. It turned out to be a very good way to try the restaurant (and a lot less expensive than the official tasting menu offered). The Caesar salad to start. Excellent choice. The dressing was superb, a bit tangy and very flavorful. Then the meatball pizza. It is a flatbread (or verrrry thin crust). Good cheese. A strong second dish. The penne with meatballs came next.  The penne was served al dante, my fav. Really good red sauce. We finished with the lasagna. It turns out we saved the best for last. That had to be one of the best lasagna I have ever eaten. Overall, strong pastas, excellent Caesar salad, very convenient location, excellent service, and reasonable price for Italian food on the Strip.",

He took zero responsibility for how Kelsey represented Allegro and the Wynn experience but did ask if I would like to sit at the bar (short staffed?)

    "text": "This restaurant is absolutely heavenly! I have had an excellent dining experience every single time I have dined here. I recently came over my birthday for a romantic dinner with my husband and they rolled out the red carpet for us. One of the main reasons I enjoy dining here is for their vegan chicken parmesan. As a vegetarian, I really respect Mr. Wynn for always including vegan and vegetarian options on all the menus at both Encore and Wynn. They are all delicious, well-done and thought out. To start, I ordered the eggplant parmesan, as I have always wanted to try it here. It is now, hands down, my favorite eggplant parm that I've ever had. It was amazing, flavorful, and was an entree in itself. Then, I ordered my usual vegan chicken parm. The only slight critique I have for the dish is it tasted slightly barbecued (not burnt, but more of a charcoal tast), which I know is to give it a more meaty or grilled flavor, but otherwise it was amazing. They even brought me out a small dessert to celebrate my birthday! The details in everything, from the service, to the menu, to the whole overall experience at Allegro, it is truly a class act. I don't expect anything less from Steve Wynn and his resort/restaurants. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to dine here again! Always a memorable experience.",

    "text": "Update: Ok so I wrote a review below for our tough experience here. The manager Gabrielle kept her word and called us back the SAME night. She gave us a credit back for part of our dinner since we didn't have time to eat it. I am impressed with this follow up. All forgiven. We will be back. We will just make sure to do 5p dinner next time instead of 5.30 if we want to catch a show.   Old review: It's not everyday you spend $230 for your family and have 5min to eat your dinner and have the manager say that's plenty of time.   Our server Adam was great. Very nice to our kids. He also told us he would get our food in asap since we were catching a 7p Le Reve show. Food gets placed at 6p. At 6.30 I get concerned but Adam assures me it's almost done. 6.45 comes around and manager Alex comes by and says almost done don't leave. I guess they wanted the business. Alex the manager proceeds to tell me \"oh you have plenty of time to eat.\"  They bring our food at 6.50. No apology. I told him to bring me the check. My poor kids were so hungry but the food was too hot for them to just shovel down. So we ate what we could in 5 minutes and left majority of the food on the table and left. I did come back after the show to voice my frustration w another manager, Gabrielle. She took my name and room number. Let's see if they actually do something. We decided to stay at the Wynn this time but normally we love our M life. Looks like it's back to Bellagio.",

While the calamari was tender, it's nothing to write home about. It is actually pretty bland.  Their bread basket is amazing. There is this focaccia flat bread that is simply divine. The garlic spread they serve with it is outstanding.  My husband ordered the meatball rigatoni and I had the seafood risotto. His dish was pretty good, but not $30 good. My risotto was actually CRUNCHY. I almost sent it back, but luckily the wine went to my head and I was too hungry to care or complain. Risotto is not easy, and I've labored over it in my own kitchen before. But, if you're not supreme at making risotto, don't put it on your menu.  We left after paying $180 for two entrees, four drinks, and an appetizer. It was not worth it.",

This is a must go to place especially if you're in the mood for pasta/pizzas. I recently thought I would change it up and get their chicken parmesan with pasta. It was good but the cheese was heavy so I didn't eat it. At the end of the night I got the worst stomach ache from the pasta and horrible heart burn. I woke up with stomach pain from the food :( Love allegro every time we visit but didn't have a good experience with their chicken Parmesan.",

When they seated us at the bar, we assumed it was just until our table was ready.  However, it seemed they intended to serve us dinner there.  This would have been fine except there were some loud bachelorettes at the next table.  No problem,  when we inquired about this they seated us in the dining room.  The food and service were ok.  My issue is that for 50 plus dollars per person, we expected a little better.  You can get the same food/ service at a Macaroni Grille or an Olive Garden.  I understand this is the Vegas Strip, but still....  The Wynn is a higher end resort.  I would not go out of my way to dine here again.    If you are in the mood for Italian food, definitely check out the Sinatra next door at the Encore.",

However, the chef never came to the table and my fiance barely made it to the front exit before she became ill.   In my complaint to the manager it is the restaurants policy to have security arrive and receive the complaint.  After that they denied serving her the gluten that made her ill, and I was told someone would call me during normal business hours.   Not exactly what I would call resolution, and with the many casinos on the strip I'm not sure I'll go back.",

The Wynn has a lot of work to do on their customer service and wait staff at this particular restaurant. Their guest relations department sends everyone that same scripted message. But when you call them out, they never respond back with anything other than emails saying someone will get back to you, hoping that you would go away. I would not even add to this review except for the impression I got when I decided to take things further by calling the restaurant myself and leaving a DETAILED message for the manager. When the so called the manager called me back, he spoke to me like I was mammy from back in the slavery days. Talking down to me in a condescending fashion as if I wanted them to give me something for free. I don't want any of your disgusting food or service... free or otherwise. I simply was following up from all of the emails that indicated they THEY WANTED TO SOMEHOW MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I am very disturbed by the number of complaints and the type of complaints coming from this place. I am done with it. But I tell you if you are vegan, gluten free.....I would not risk my diet here.

We went here for dinner and were bitterly disappointed by the standard of food we had here. Greasy, runny, and off-tasting lasagna and other similarly off putting entrees. To elaborate, when I'm drunk I usually have a lower standard of food (Jack in the box tastes fucking Gourmet), but unfortunately Alegro could not even meet that par for me.

Being just off the casino floor, this restaurant is more casual than some of the other choices in the hotel but I was honestly surprised that it wasn't super noisy. It's a great place to people-watch while you eat.  As for the food? Tres Bien! I was super impressed to note that the same amount of care went into making their vegetarian food as it did to their omnivore fare. My friend and I were having trouble choosing and ended up sharing the butternut squash ravioli and the vegan pizza made with almond ricotta and spinach fondue.

They literally made our entire party move to a SMALLER table for no reason whatsoever, so that one person had to leave and then when we explained the situation NOTHING was done. We were not resat, a manager did not come over, NOTHING. We ordered apps and I asked for more bread, the waiter literally said to me \"You have more appetizers coming\" and walked away again, no apology and no explanation. He then came back several minutes later and plopped a bread basket down in front of me and said \"I didn't understand your question\" then walked away again. Meanwhile, the entrees all came out at separate times and it was a NIGHTMARE getting the checks split as requested. We had 60 people staying at the Wynn for a convention and not one of us had a great dining experience here. For a place with $50 entrees I would expect a much higher level of service and a manager to follow up when there has been an issue with a large party. Needless to say, we will never be returning. Our company often travels to Vegas for work and have warned everyone to never frequent this establishment again, unless you want to be rewarded with rude and incompetent service.",

    "text": "A casual Italian restaurant with a fancy ambiance. I was surprised to find Allegro to be opened until 6am. Perfect for those after-clubbing cravings/munchies. They are located close by to the Wynn parking garage and a hop & skip away from the Wynn/Encore theaters.  My party of 10 and I was here on a Thursday for a late dinner. We had a pre-set menu kinda thing.....a dinner/nightclub package, if you will. Some items that were brought out to our table include:  arugula salad bosco (roasted mushroom, ricotta cheese and white truffle oil) pizza  fettuccini pasta with chicken, cauliflower and broccoli  chicken francaise and an individual sized cheesecake bite that looked like a cupcake. It was a perfect finish...rich but not overly sweet.  We also got red sangria as part of our pre-set menu. Had a FEW sips of that....definitely not a fan of red myself but my party enjoyed it. (I wonder how their white sangria taste like?)  Service was solid. Our waiter kept our glasses full and took our empty plates away in a timely manner since we still had the second part of our night to attend. Yes, the prices are on the high side but you're on The Strip ANDDDDDD....at one of the most luxurious resort in Las Vegas. I think when you step foot inside the Wynn/Encore, you should get an idea on what to expect.",

The ambiance is always energetic but the restaurant is dynamic in the sense that it can provide a good business, social or romantic setting. The bar is great for catching a game, having a drink or a full meal.   The service is excellent all around. Make reservations for prime times or expect a wait.  The menu is comfort Italian. I love the flat breads, veal parm, salads and pasta.  I think this is one of the best late night spots in town and arguably the best spot in town for people watching.",

The calamari looked like the phony calamari (pig intestines deep fried) with each and every piece looking identical. And it was rubbery and served luke warm. The bruschetta was even worse. Two pieces of stale, cold toast,one topped with a tomato slice and a piece of cheese, the other had a slice of tomato, and some sort of potato sausage ball sliced into four cubes. I quit there,and did not even order a main course.   Please Steve, get someone in there who knows how to cook!!",

We had tickets to the show, so dinner came out fast, but not rushed. Even talked to the head chef, who was a very nice guy.

As soon as he walked up to our table last night we told him he was our server a year ago and then he remembered us and how much fun we had. Now onto our food.        I seriously think they need to change up their menu somewhat. My wife had the grilled brussel sprouts salad and it was very good to excellent. Depends on your taste of course. I had the same Caesar salad from last year (they forgot the croutons this time), and now I am certain they need to update their Caesar. Completely. We split the rigatoni and meatballs and it is a huge portion of food. THE MEATBALLS WERE THE STAR OF DINNER LAST NIGHT. And their Lasagna is very good. I do remember that from last year. Next time though I'm having Linguini and clams because of how delicious it looked at the next table. Lastly, I'm available as a consultant if you're interested in making your wine list terrific. I stole that line from the Donald. If you don't follow politics you won't get it. But I'm serious about the offer none the less.",

The Bruschetta was nothing more than diced tomatoes on sourdough bread, the Caesar dressing had NO flavor, the lasagna was from hamburger helper I'm assuming and the chicken parmesan was one of those frozen banquet meals from the frozen section at the dollar tree.  When we asked what size the pizza was we were told 14\", to a normal person the means a round medium sized pizza.  This wasn't round, nor was it rectangle like a flatbread, it was oval and thin and the sauce was diluted tomato paste.  The baked clams were okay and the proscuitto platter was good but way over priced.   We were finished with our salads and appetizers before our entree orders were even taken and even after this was brought to the managements attention no compensation was offered.  Here's our bill; 3 Coors Light      $24 *Reasonable 2 Crown Royal    $27 *Reasonable 1 Bruschetta       $15 (Four Pieces)  1 Baked Clams   $18 (Five Pieces) 1 Proscuitto Pltr  $29 1 Caesar             $12 1 Pepperoni Piz  $20 1 Ent Special      $28 (Butternut Squash Ravioli, actually not bad) 1 Lasagna          $29 1 Chicken Parm $27 (This was a replacement entree for something we sent back, I don't even                                                                                               -                                  know what that was) Subtotal             $229 Tax                    $18.55 Total                  $247.55  I'm industry, just so you know, and the guests I had with me own the Number one Italian Restaurant in Anchorage.  This was a huge disappointment not only with the food but with the  pace of service.  What you need is some major house cleaning and a nice re-vamp of your menu.",

Although our server was extremely efficient and knowledgeable, all I can say about the meal was it was ordinary and expensive.  The fresh bread service was the best part of dinner. The Caesar salads were clearly made ahead of time and were neither crispy or tasty.  The pasta dishes were good, not great.    The triple chocolate dessert was overly chilled (it has a mousse layer) and the cake was hard (stale).    I would not eat here again at Wynn.",

We ended up in the lounge, which I HEARTILY recommend, as it affords excellent people-watching opportunites -- our table was right by the casino walkway, and so much fun to mock all the pretentious idiots walking past!

I ordered a caesar salad and added shrimp but she failed to mention that it was an additional $13 dollars for 5 pieces of shrimp. Fine, whatever. but when we saw the bill and were conversing over how appalling the upcharge was she looked at us and rudely said \"well you are at the wynn\" and then snickered. So rude. The worst part was that the tip was already included in the total check so it was clear that she was acting the way she was because she was going to receive a tip regardless.  Then when we told the the front desk receptionist she was really sweet and accommodating and immediately grabbed a manager. However, when she arrived she seemed careless about our plight and was simply just there wasting our time by pretending to listen. She didn't sympathize or offer any relief whatsoever. We will not be coming back and i recommend skipping this place unless you are fine with spending a fortune whilst reviewing poor customer service.",

I believe I would have given 5 stars if the check in for dinner was handled a bit better by the two hostesses--it just didn't seem that they had proper training or etiquette, but it all worked out.  We got seated--finally--and enjoyed a couple of rounds of drinks, followed by a marvelous collection of dishes including lobster Mac and cheese, albino pizza and another 1/2 meatball, 1/2 pepperoni pizza, the Cod which was to die for, meatballs and that got a late evening started off perfectly.  The wait staff was fabulous and we appreciated their interactive engagement with us--we had a ball!",

As a good Italian boy, I know my pasta, and the pasta we had here was to die for.  Delicious, fresh made pasta.  So perfect.  The wild boar ragu was wonderful.  The pastas are generous portions.  Almost had a hard time finding room for dessert.   Glad we did, as the tiramisu was absolutely amazing.   The cheesecake comes with a thin, long cookie that will melt in your mouth.   So glad we had dinner at Allegro.  Five stars!!",

I guess this is the place to be after partying at XS because the Wynn/Encore does not have too many late night food options. This is probably the equivalent of Secret Pizza at Cosmo, except a lot more expensive and much more formal.  Between a group of 7, we shared the Bianca and Foccacia pizzas. The pizzas came in 8 square slices and was plenty of food to share. I really liked both pizzas, but they were definitely more like flatbread than pizza.  We also shared the Calamari and Baked clams, but nothing notable to say about those two.   One of the things about this place is how slow everything is. Took a good 10-15 minutes before anyone came to take our order.   Because there are so many great restaurants at the Wynn, I probably won't be coming back to this one.",

The Bosco pizza is my go to when I'm here late like tonight. It is a thin crust pizza that I get extra crispy that has Roasted Mushroom Puree, Ricotta Cheese and White Truffle Oil. It's delicious. Everyone I introduce this pizza to loved it. Another favorite item on the menu that I like me is the Grilled Organic Salmon that is accompanied with Grilled Asparagus and Tomato Coulis coming in at a total of 320 calories.

The only person who was friendly was the hostess. Davide our waiter was terrible he took forever to get to our table at four in the afternoon when there was barely anyone in the restaurant. He then took our order with a whatever attitude. He seemed bothered to be working. We ordered the meatball pizza which was nothing out of this world. I would say if you are in the Wynn pass on Allegro no one in the is happy to be there!  Also note that if you order the happy hour check your bill they will charge you regular price and unless you question it they won't fix it!",

The cool thing about allegro is they have a full menu offering all the way until the 5-6am. Meaning, you can stumble off the craps table or out of XS  and still grab a gourmet meal, that is much better then the run of the mill egg options usually offered at late night eateries. This comes at a cost, be prepared to spend a pretty penny. But so worth it!",

I loved the first piece but then really struggled to eat any more of it, not sure why. Maybe too much truffle oil made it just too rich?  On the other hand, our waiter was exceptional. He was very friendly and professional and he spent just the right amount of time at the table, never checking on us too often or not often enough.  As a caveat, I absolutely adored this restaurant when it was Stratta. Part of the reason for this trip to Vegas was to eat at Stratta one more time before my husband and I moved to the East Coast. Unfortunately, we didn't do our homework and I didn't know it had changed to Allegro. Once we arrived, I called the Wynn to make reservations at Stratta and they assured me that although the name had changed, the menu was the same. It is not. It has the same structure (i.e. it's a typical Italian menu but it also has a small vegan section) but not the same dishes.  So, 2-stars because I've experienced better both at this \"same restaurant\" a year ago and elsewhere in Vegas.",

It's thin crust and you can taste each and every ingredient (prosciutto, arugula, etc). The spaghetti and meatballs wasn't my fave but my friends really liked the meatballs.   My friends and I went to Vegas twice in 3 months and came here both times after XS. Overpriced for what you get but it's Vegas. The close proximity makes up for it (although it doesn't feel so close by the end of the night when you're dying in your heels)!",

    "text": "There are many amazing dining experiences to be had at the Wynn but our recent meal at Allegro was a stand out - in particular, the 3 course chef's tasting menu.  They call it 3 courses but this is quite misleading because it's really more like 8 courses.  What they call the 1st course is actually 5 items - thin crust pizza, fried calamari, fig & prosciutto bruschetta, carpaccio and their famous meatballs.  It was a lot of food and it was all amazing.  It appeared that each serving size was the actual item ordered off the menu, not just a small tasting portion.  This is definitely not your usual tasting menu - more like an all you can eat.  We could have walked away happy after the 1st course but next came the 2nd course of seafood risotto.  Again, another amazing dish that seemed to be the entre sized portion.  Stuffed to the gills already, we still had the main course of salmon and filet mignon, both of which were superb.  In True Italian style, everything was fresh, the flavors were amazing and the portion sizes beyond generous.  Special thanks to our server Jack for taking such good care of us.  Definitely returning to Allegro on our next visit to Vegas!",

After getting seated, my sister started to feel cold since the AC was blasting in the restaurant. A friend of ours took of his dress shirt for to cover her but later was told by a man in the suit that he cannot wear a tank top in the restaurant. We then asked a man in the suit if there's any blanket or warm cloth for my sister so she doesn't get sick. The man stated that they didn't have any blanket, and then suggested her to use napkins! (How is napkin going to keep her from getting cold?!)  Then comes Davide, this wonderful and courteous waiter, who did his best by asking everyone if there's anything to cover my sister, he wasn't going to give up, and that's when the man in suit realized he needed to do something, thus, he FINALLY brought us a t-shirt that he had at the back. Had it not been for Davide, my sister will probably end up getting sick. So I appreciate Davide's persistence! Thank you!",

    "text": "I don't know what \"Allegro\" means in Italian, but I think \"Merda\" is a much more fitting name for this garbage of a restaurant. I very much enjoy the other restaurants and bars in Wynn and Encore, so I figured Allegro would be of similar quality. Wow, was I wrong....  Let's start with the service, or rather, the lack thereof. We were seated by the hostess, brought water by our server, and then we waited....and waited....and waited....and after I think ten years passed, our order was finally taken. As if that was not enough, our server then decided to ignore multiple requests to refill my drink and never once came back to ask how our food was (spoiler alert: it was terrible). Perhaps she stepped out to play a few hands or was in the back taking a few puffs, but whatever the case was, the service was reminiscent of something I would expect at Applebee's....if Applebee's started hiring servers from McDonald's.  Now, the food...I ordered a turkey dinner for Thanksgiving. The turkey had bone, cartilage, and a decent amount of skin on it. You would think that for a $40 turkey dinner, the kitchen staff would have wherewithal to remove the inedible parts of a turkey, but I guess that would require too much brain power for Allegro to handle. The mashed potatoes were clearly microwaved and did not taste fresh at all, while the gravy tasted like it was made from a McCormick turkey gravy mix packet. Absolutely disgusting. I would not feed this garbage to my dog.  Allegro was disappointing. Terrible, inattentive, and incompetent service married by dog food-quality food make Allegro a place I will never be dining at again. Save yourself the money and just go to Applebee's (or don't eat, as that will surely be more enjoyable than Allegro).",

    "text": "I had two words repeating in my head after my dining experience here: disappointed and expensive. I have looked at some of the reviews, and I am thinking my experience was partly due to menu choice, but a good experience should not depend heavily on menu choice.   I ordered the bianca pizza, which according to the description has mozzarella, arugula, prosciutto, and shaved Parmesan. First of all, the word \"pizza\" has a certain connotation. I expect at least a thin layer of dough that is not the texture of a cracker (that texture I associate with \"flatbread\"). Second, the description of the ingredients was not wrong, but they each had a problem: 1) The mozzarella was difficult to find 2) The prosciutto had a fishy flavor and reminded me of smoked fish 3) The arugula was overwhelming and excessive 4) The Parmesan was shaved on top without the benefit of heat, so it was falling off the pizza with every bite. Third, I was expecting some seasoning: salt, pepper, basil, oregano, balsamic drizzle, olive oil drizzle, etc.   My impression was that I paid $21 for a dry and bland cracker loaded with a dressing-less arugula salad. I guess that's Vegas - you win some, you lose some.",

Granted, eating pasta at 1:00 in the morning isn't usually advisable but when in Vegas... go for it. And this pasta was indeed worth it. Cooked to a perfect al dente with rich and flavor sauces, whether the rigatoni with meatballs or the kale and ricotta ravioli, everybody enjoyed their meal. The chilled cucumber soup was a bit odd, with a lack of salt that was almost made up for by the spicy kick at the end.  The big issue was the terse and inattentive service, but I suppose that's what you get at 1am.",

WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!!  Allegro is the Italian restaurant you would take friends and relatives to that come to visit you when in Vegas.  We shared the veal chop parmigiana, the eggplant parmigiana, and the vegan pasta with vegetables.  While this was plenty of food for two people, I probably could have eaten more just because it tasted so damn good.   The veal chop was perfectly tender, the eggplant so flavorful and the pasta was al dente while the veggies were soft and edible to the taste.  Each dish rendered oohs and ahs from both of us for as long as we took to eat it.  ( It did not take long.)  Our meal was also made better by the fact that we had great server named Adam who was as gracious a server as we have ever had.  Adam was polite, knowledgeable, and friendly and was just on the ball with his service.  I highly recommend use ask for him when you dine here.   WE WILL BE BACK!!!!",

The salmon, which is supposed to be the favorite dish, tasted like a reheated piece from costco. The dish was smaller than expected, despite supposedly being a filling meal. It came with a side of roasted asparagus. The clam linguine was one of the better dishes, but lacked flavor. The saving grace of our meal was the comlientary bread basket served with garlic and olive spread. The service was great and the ambience romantic, but I don't think we'll visit this restaurant on the next trip.",

Besides the pasta being a tad al dente (gf spaghetti noodles need to be cooked slightly longer otherwise they'd snap into short pieces like it did for my dinner), it was delicious - full of seasonal veggies and drizzled with olive oil & crushed garlic.  I finished the entire plate (and the portions were not skimpy). A definite Vegas regular for me from now on!",

This restaurant is very veggie friendly and the service is top notch as well.  I ordered the following: - Margherita Pizza: This is DELICIOUS!!! I wish I had a bigger tummy to stuff the whole pizza that night.  I was craving this pizza the next day as well.  It is thin-crust and very well made.  Loved it. - Mezzi Rigatoni: This pasta is made European style without any sauce.  It has butternut squash, lentils, and fresh herbs.  We ordered it without the Burrata Cream.  The pasta was delicious.  I am craving it as I write this review.  Overall, I was very happy with the food and service at Allegro.  My company has an annual conference at the Wynn, and I cannot wait to go back to this place and try the other vegetarian options on the menu.",

Everyone in our party had an excellent meal.   Orders ranged from pasta.   I had vegan pasta, not because it was vegan, but because it sounded great and it was!   Pasta perfectly al dente with delicious vegetables.  I asked them to add some heat to it and they made it perfect.    We also had the salmon which was excellent and simply prepared.       Salads were excellent as well.  Fresh and not over dressed.   Good selection of wines which were excellent.

My buddy and I tried this place out and were left full and satisfied.  We shared the bianca pizza which wasn't really that good.  In fact, the crust was really dry and the flat bread lacked cheese.  As an entree, this pizza is large enough.  My buddy ordered the carbonara which comes with homemade pasta, a pretty heavy cream sauce, great smokey bacon, mushrooms, and nasty bell peppers!  I would have loved this pasta to death but the bell peppers ruined it for me.  I had the moon fish that's served with mushrooms and lobsters in a citrus sauce.  I didn't particularly like the sauce being overly tart and acidic but the fish was cooked properly.  Allegro is a rather casual upscale restaurant but there are many better options at the wynn/encore",

Food is quite bland with nothing special in taste.  We got the Chicken Parmesan, a Caesar salad with chicken and the salmon entree.   Chicken Parmesan is what you would get at Denny's - a thin mealy breast smothered in mozzarella cheese with a rather salty tomato sauce.  Entree comes with your choice of pasta.  Unfortunately the sauce tastes like Ragu from a jar and that's being generous.   Chicken Caesar salad was simply tasteless. No dressing, no taste nothing to report. Adding the chicken breast doubles the cost of the salad.  Salmon is about 1 oz of fish with about 5 beautifully peeled asparagus spears.   Add a glass of wine for ONE person and dinner for three people is $150 The basket of bread was the best thing to report. Stick with the bread and you are golden.",

My husband had the minestrone soup and enjoyed it very much. It was the best course for him. For me, my lasagna entree was fabulous. I loved the small bite mixture of sausage and beef.

Chef Enzo pervades the dining room as he speaks to each guest and monitors guest satisfaction.  He is proud of his culinary delights and will explain preparations and ingredients if asked with delight.  We started with zucchini blossom, to die for eggplant parmigiana and garlic bread.  The breadbasket is delicious with fresh foccacio bread.  For main course, the four of us shared a lamb shank, a delicious lasagna with short ribs and melted mozzarella and meatballs which was unique and scrumptious!!!  We were so happy to sit down and enjoy True authentic well prepared Italian food without pretentiousness in Las Vegas.  It is no wonder that the Chez won Chef of the year in Las Vegas!  Well deserved!!!!",

I know I know it's Vegas, but seriously it's not that hard.  Two of us had that dish and the third had lasagna which looked great. Portions were large. Service was attentive. We were seated promptly with no reservation on a Sunday night. While waiting for the third person in our party the manager came to ask if we would mind moving. There was a large party coming in later and they didn't want us to feel rushed. No problem with that but having been within five minutes of seating the hostess should have just put us elsewhere. All in all a good meal.",

I met a sweet Japanese hottie on a fairly recent trip while having lunch at another hotel. We ended up hanging out quite a few times. We decided to go to Wynn one late evening after she got off of work. We ended up stopping off at Allegro and sat at the bar. She requested for me to order citing, \"You have good taste. I trust your choices.\" So dammit, I did! I ordered the Calamari & Shrimp and the Bone In m'fn Ribeye for Two! HOMERUN!!! The food was stupid good. The Calamari & Shrimp were deep fried perfectly and not too greasy. The Ribeye... It was tender, juicy, and so damn tasty!!! She was salivating as much as I was! The bartender was cool, the service was great, the ambiance was nice, and the prices were expected. I recommend Allegro the next time you're at Wynn Hotel. BTW: I won 5 hundie on the craps table after that. Boom! Woooohoooo!",

I expected more given their prices and the fact that it is a Wynn estabishment.    The real value here is the fact that it is open 24 hours and a convenient spot for food after a long night at Tryst, XS, or Surrender.  That along side that it is conveniently located around high walking traffic areas for these clubs (allowing you to people-watch and spark conversation with intoxicated club-goers as they stumble home).  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice restaurant with great service... but if you are looking for good food after-hours, you'll find better value and options elsewhere.",

We were a group of 4 and went for the 4 course Chef's tasting menu.  Delicious! We enjoyed all of the items that are prefixed. Be forewarned that we were close to full after the first course of appetizers and we had to stop eating so we could enjoy the rest! Great size portions but almost too much. Being a group of hearty eaters however we finished up everything they brough after the appetiizers..haha..My favorites: meatballs, carpaccio, bruschetta, Rosotto Pescatora, filet mignon and eggplant parmesean that was served with the entrees.  We struck up conversation with a  wonderful woman dining alone who had the salmon and kale salad. She raved about both!  Would definitely come back and it was just a few steps from La Reve.",

The only actual restaurant serving food was Allegro, which was initially pretty crowded but I was later able to find an open seat at the bar.  I went with the wood-fired Meatball Pizza ($21).  It comes out as a somewhat large oblong-shaped flatbread cut into eight square pieces with each square containing a small wedge of meatball.  Doubtless, it hits the spot late at night when you're jonesing for food, but I wouldn't recommend Allegro for anything beyond that purpose.  The pizza and meatball lack any distinctive taste, and a better presentation would have been to cut the meatball lengthwise and scatter throughout.  Frankly, one would probably be better off  getting room service.",

And this is the only place at the Wynn that you can get a decent meal at 3AM (at least I believe so).  Spaghetti and meatballs on the late night menu.  A bit on the pricey side, but hey, you can't expect any less from a top notch Vegas hotel.  I'm a huge fan of the spaghetti and meatball, but I think this place can work on their recipe.  Call me crazy but I tasted too much fennel... but it was 3AM so who knows what I was tasting.  I also found a bit of a sausage in my pasta. (I pretended I was upset with the server in that the kitchen accidentally dropped food in my pasta that wasn't supposed to be in it.  But to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's like when you get that random onion ring in your fries at Burger King.  Best feeling EVER!!!)  But the waiter said that they add sausage to their marinara on purpose for flavoring.... Hmmmmm, should I believe him??  Our server could have been completely serious, or he could be really witty and thought of a great response right on the spot.  I will never know, but I will always remember this night and that lonely sausage.",

    "text": "Just after a show, probably 10:00 pm, I hoped for the best. I walked up to the Allegro greeter's station during a very quiet week in Vegas, and asked if there was room for a solo, seeing that the front portion and bar of the restaurant looked lively and comfortably full. The first question was \"are you staying with us?\" (meaning the Wynn/Encore) Thankfully (I thought) I was, and was asked for my room number, name and food allergies. Interesting! I was immediately shown to a table near the back (which I appreciated, giving me a great view). I was the only solo at a table but I also didn't feel like others were inconvenienced by a solo taking a table for two. (Solos have a lot of time to think ...)   I was greeted and served by a charming young man whose English I didn't quite understand but whose french-like accent managed to get his message across even if I had to ask him to repeat. As I had already read the menu out in the casino space, I didn't take much time to decide on my order. He picked up on my quick dispense of the menus and offered to take my order. I ordered veal Marsala and was stunned to find it delivered what seemed like minutes later. Meantime I was offered a white bean hummus and selection of breads/flatbreads which were spectacular. I've since read that many share my enthusiasm for this hummus. The speed in which my order arrived made me suspicious however I will (after tasting, prodding, looking at the kitchen which is semi-transparent in that you can see the expediters working) say that if well prepared, my dish was put together with organized speed. The demi-glace that was my Marsala was tasty if not a little too shiny, and the mushrooms (piopinni?) delicious. The veal was fork tender. This dish does not come with accompaniment so it is very brown. A diner seated next-table asked about it and lamented he didn't order it instead of his pizza.   I didn't look at the dessert menu because I was satisfied with my meal, but expect it have to been excellent.   I saw a few tables of more than 10 so know they accommodate bigger parties.",

    "text": "Before going to the night club XS in the Wynn Hotel we had dinner at Allegro which is a nice Italian restaurant with good food and nice decor.  There were 8 of us so we decide to order family style so we could try a number of dishes.  Before any of the appetizers came out they brought a bread basket with some great baguette and a garlic butter spread.  The bread was very good but I'm not sure why a social place like Vegas always serves or cooks with so much garlic when you're constantly in people's faces.  To fix that we asked for some olive oil and the server happily brought it out.  The first few appetizers we orders were just ok and pretty average except for their bruschetta.  First was the fried calamari with marinara sauce and there was nothing new here.  The calamari was lightly battered but the squid was a bit too chewy.  I liked how spicy the marinara sauce was but I'm guessing it would be too much for the average guest.  Next was the clams casino and what I liked was they used very big chunks of clams so when mixed with the bread crumbs you could taste the seafood.  Many places will just mince up the clam meat so it gets lost in the breadcrumbs. Finally, their spin on bruschetta was excellent.  Nice crispy baguette, fresh mozzarella, ripe tomatoes and prosciutto.  This had an amazing blend of flavor and texture and it wasn't loaded with garlic!  Next was the pizza course and this is where they started to shine!  We ordered a pepperoni and one meatball pie.  Both had impressively thin crust and the sauce and cheese was very flavorful.  If there were a local pizza joint that served this type of pizza it would be jam packed every night.  Finally we did a pasta course and tried three different types.  First was the Risotto Pescatora and they did a nice job with this dish.  It had excellent flavor, nice al dente rice and the sea food was cooked perfectly.  It's real easy to overcook the seafood when preparing in a sauce and they got it spot on!  Next was the Rigatoni and meat balls and this is where I had an issue.  The Rigatoni and sauce was good but the meatballs need an overhaul.  In my experience a meat ball should be light, fluffy and easily split with a fork.  It's the breadcrumbs that help create this texture and I don't think Allegro added much.  In their defense using less bread crumbs makes a more expensive meatball!  However, it made the balls very dense and the flavor of the sauce wasn't able to penetrate the ball to give it flavor during the cooking process.  Finally, we had the rosemary and black pepper scialatielli carbonara.  This dish was very rich and flavorful and was very good.  It was actually my favorite of the pasta course but I'm glad we did family style since it might have been too rich to just eat it.  Over all we really enjoyed the restaurant, the service and the food even though I'm a little critical with some of the details.",

The drinks were very tasty so a great start.  Got seated and decided on the special, which was a homemade sausage and buckwheat pasta plate, and the Zuppa Guazzetto, as well as a side salad.  The caeser salad was split for us to share and very nice taste and portions.  When the entree's arrived, both were good, but we thought the Zuppa was a little bland.  The special plate was flavorful and unique, but wouldn't be a repeat for me as the buckwheat flavor was a little overpowering.  The other dinners we noticed from the nearby tables were nice portions, pizzas looked great as well as the spaghetti with meatballs.  In retrospect, I probably should have gone with a pizza, the spaghetti or lasagna, but we will go back to try again.  By the way, Le Reve is spectacular...",

Total dinner time was about two and a half hours.  I understand dinner is an \"event\" when you are in a nice restaurant but the service was about three stars at best.  The pizza was good, nothing special.  I didn't try the lasagna though it had great eye appeal.  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came back medium well.  Normally I would send it back when paying $45.00 for a steak but it took us an hour and a half to get our food so I passed.  My friend ordered his steak medium and it too was overcooked to about medium well.  The steaks had a nice sear on them however and were seasoned well but it's hard for me to eat an overcooked steak.   The dining room was very loud so if you're looking for a romantic dinner I would skip it.  Food was priced reasonable for a nice Vegas resort given my complaints, I would try it again if I was in the hotel.",

Unfortunately I had to send back the pasta with meatballs dish because the pasta was so under cooked it was hard to even cut with a fork, and the meat ball tasted really strange. They were nice enough to replace it with a different dish, but just a few bites in I started feeling sick to my stomach. Was it the pasta & meatball I had sampled? Could it have been the new dish? Who knows but whatever t was it didn't want to stay down! The only problem was the bathroom was closed for cleaning. I am still recovering from knee surgery and was in a desperate moment, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to walk all the way to the other bathroom in time. The manager was so kind, he offered to get me a wheelchair. But honestly I was so sick and barely made it with my limited mobility. The 2 stars are for the waiter who was kind and helpful, and the manager who offered the wheelchair. Three stars off for possibly giving me food poisoning. It's been a few hours and I still feel horrible even after throwing up several times. :( I will NEVER go back to this place!",

The food didn't take long to come out after we ordered, so it wasn't the kitchen, it was solely the wait staff.   I ordered a Caesar to start, a petit filet minion, with potatoes au gratin and asparagus as sides. Yes, I was starving. First bite into the salad and the only thing I tasted was salt. I had maybe 4 bites and put it to the side. My perfectly cooked meat was inedible with how much salt was added on. I was so saddened by this. As you might guess, this was the same story with both of the side dishes.   The cocktails weren't anything to get excited over, and the glass my champagne came in was sticky. Gross.   I would rather eat a sandwich at the quick 24- hour cafe right next door next time I'm at the Wynn.",

Reason being is that just like the rest of the hotel chain restaurants on the strip they are expensive for no reason, paying for the name. What saved them and earned the 4 stars was the service that our waiter provided. Very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to make some strong recommendations on what to actually order. The group I went with had a taste for pizza and we all just shared. The pepperoni pizza was good but $20 worth? Not so much... The white sangria is a really good and made to perfection, they aced that challenge for sure so kudos to the bartender. I will be sure to return for another dining experience and try another one their signature dishes!",

Allegro is the worst dining experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Vegas. It's actually pretty shocking that a 5-star hotel like the Wynn, in which Allegro is located, would allow for this restaurant to negatively affect it's superior image.  The food came out very late. The tomato soup I ordered was warm and bland. It was as if they had just bought a regular can of tomato soup from the market, put it into a bowl, and charged $14. The chicken parmesan that my friend and I both ordered was also very disappointing for $40 each. I have had better frozen microwaveable chicken parms.  The server, Jamie, wasn't even apologetic for how long it took for the food to come out. And it's not surprising that other Yelp reviews include Jamie as being \"absolutely the worst server.\" She was also not very accommodating when another friend came to join us.   Allegro is one of those restaurants that Gordon Ramsay should fix on his TV show, Kitchen Nightmares, to teach the cooks and berate terrible waitresses like Jamie.",

On our way out to the parking garage we saw this restaurant and decided to give it a try. Upon speaking to the hostess for a wait time she left my question unanswered and continued to speak to her coworker. Then looked back and stated how many? She then seated us with no menu. And didn't say another word. After 15-20 minutes the server came by and said there's a change of menu and handed us all a \"happy hour menu\". On Christmas Day with my family at the Wynn? The last thing we wanted was happy hour bar food. Thanks but no thanks. However, since we were seated and we didn't want to ruin the cheerful vibe so we stayed for another 15 minutes. The server failed to serve us or even have the courtesy to take our drink order?! We've been to the Wynn several times! I was shocked at the service!!!! It was so disappointing that I actually took the time to write out my full experience. Off to Ceaser Palace we go for some 5 star Yelp service!  Best restaurants, best service, best quality and never fails my family.   Like most bad experience the generous 1 star usually would be a 0 star if it was accepted.",

Allegro's casual atmosphere is perfect for a pre-show meal or late night supper, open until 6 AM, yes you read it right. So perfect for post clubbing right.       Well it was CES 2014 trip,so no late night out was allowed, but we managed to come here a few times for late night snacks.        Love the red decor, the pasta-like chandelier from the ceiling, such a beautiful space, warm and inviting, surprisingly gorgeous for a casual resto here at Wynn.   - MEATBALL SLIDERS * Housemade Meatballs, Baked Brioche Bread, Served with French Fries - the bomb, love it.  - MARGHERITA * Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Basil,  it was so thin crust, the cheese was melting nicely, it was so good.  - CALAMARI * Fried Calamari, Italian Green Fried Peppers, Spicy Tomato Sauce - this  sauce is so addictive, this is  1 of the signature and we  LOVE IT.  - PARMESAN POLENTA * Creamy Corn Polenta, Italian Sausage, Parmesan Cheese - this was so creamy, buttery, melt in your mouth goodness, the sausage was delish and I can't describe how perfect this dish was at the late night hour, after CES 2014, after you lost a few hands + 10 at the tables, this just hits the spot.  - BAKED LASAGNA NAPOLETANA* * Sunday Meat Ragu Sauce, Meatballs, Smoked Mozzarella, Pine Nuts - chef Enzo Febbraro's signature dish... Now this is why I work out and run :-) it's totally worth it, PLEASE order this dish.         Allegro also offers many dishes for vegan and vegetarian, it's such a great spot for quick bite, quality food, relatively cheaper than all the restaurants here at Wynn and Encore, open till 6 AM. Jackpot!          The wine list by the glass was surprisingly reasonable, old and new world.         We were at the bar and our bartender was KAOU, she's from Hawaii. She was so awesome and gracious with our louder than life group, OK, just me with my big lung :-)          Chef Enzo Febbraro was in and out of the kitchen greeting his diners. He's so personable, kind, and has the biggest smile and hug. He was lovely enough to explain to us about his food and ingredients, made our visits were much more enjoyable. My team loved every visit here.         Note if you come here at lunch, same dishes, same pizza, you can save 30% OFF compare to dinner! Probably 1 of the cheaper restaurants at Wynn and Encore.",

Service is never so great, but in past years the food has been a solid 4, so when we were looking for a place for a casual but tasty meal, I suggested Allegro. Not going to do that again.  Service was really strange. We had two waiters (didn't seem to be a shift change). The one that started our order wasn't particularly friendly but managed to take our orders for drinks and food. When i ordered the shrimp pizza he went out of his way to say it was excellent (more on that later). He then proceeded to disappear for the duration of our visit. Another waiter started serving us after we got our food, and he was friendly, but there was a period of 30 minutes where nobody visited out table (not even to refill drinks).  Oh boy the food. What a disappointment. My friend ordered the seafood risotto which was OK at best. Nothing to write home about but nothing deserving a scathing review. I ordered the shrimp pizza and it was awful. Just terrible. it had a white sauce and ricotta cheese, and one shrimp per piece. But the real trouble was that it was so very very bland and the texture was mealy and difficult. There were onions and peppers and peas on the pizza as well, but all were chopped into small, pea sized pieces which further accentuated the mealiness. I was starving after a long day working a convention and i could only eat one piece. My friend thought i was crazy - \"how could it be that bad?\" - and then he tasted it. I would have complained at this time but there was literally no way to flag down a waiter - they were all just GONE. So it became kind of a joke for us and i shared my friend's plate.  When a waiter finally came we told him how bad it was. He offered to get a manager and serve us something else but by that time i had no interest. In the kindest way possible we asserted that there was really no redeeming quality to the dish. He said it was a relatively new item on the menu, and we suggested everyone try it--because if anybody did they would know that nobody in their right mind would like this dish. Later he came back and said that he shared our opinion with the chef. Apparently the chef told him that it was \"more of a european style pizza\" to which i thought \"give me a effing break!\"   Seriously, the nerve of the chef to defend his dish by criticizing our palates. I love all kinds of food but this dish is seriously flawed. I dare that chef to eat his own dish and come back for seconds.   So i'll be avoiding Allegro in the future!",

Nothing happy about it EXCEPT the bartender, I don't believe she offered her name, but she was wonderful.  I ordered the pizza, the pepperoni pizza, I always like to get pizza when I'm traveling, just trying to see who really makes a great pizza.   The pizza was dry, had no cheese and it was burnt. I didn't complain to the bartender, she was by herself and was trying to entertain all of her guests.   Firstly the guy who brought my pizza out dropped it in front of me without a word, and if you are going to be so rude, then at least drop off some decent pizza. It was the worse pizza I have ever eaten. Again no sauce, no cheese, just pepperoni on a cracker, and I'm a huge fan of thin crust.  I seen people winning on the floor, that lets me know the slots aren't super tight, I've never actually seen anyone win in Vegas on the slots, I won, then I lost it back, that's fine, I was more disappointed in the food than I was losing my money.

    "text": "Our friend (who's a local) wanted to take us to the legendary Nora's but they weren't answering their phone so he gave up on getting a reservation. Instead, we went to the incredible Wynn Hotel and stopped in Allegro for the Italian food he was craving. When you walk in, the interior is cool and classy with lots of reds and earth tones. You'll also see the incredibly large amount of wine stored through the glass.   The menu is pretty standard Italian. Soups, salads, pastas, pizza and the occasional steak are what you'll find here. As per my usual, I ordered the chicken parmigiana and it was outstanding. They smash it flat before they cook it, and when I say flat I mean FLAT. The chicken covered almost the whole plate. That said, it was perfectly cooked. The chicken was still tender and the sauce was super tasty. The spaghetti was pretty standard but I was so full from the chicken that I couldn't finish it anyway. One of my friends got the wild boar ragu and he was still talking about it two days later (which made me somewhat jealous that I didn't get that). Service was pretty great. Pretty attentive which meant my water glass was rarely empty, which I always use as the measuring stick for good service.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Allegro. I always have high expectations when I walk into a Wynn property and they were easily met. Now, would I come to the Wynn just for Allegro? Nah. But if I was staying or visiting the Wynn/Encore I'd absolutely consider it.",

We were able to get seated right away and service was fairly quick.   We started with the table bread, which was surprisingly not an additional charge (I worry about these things in expensive Vegas!). For my main dish, I ordered the vegan pasta. It's made with \"organic ancient grain penne,\" EVOO, basil, garlic, tomato, zucchini, and asparagus. I added some shredded parmesan, too, since I'm not actually vegan. It was a good dish - a little light on the veggies so not as filling as I'd like, but tasty. I picked at some of my friend's pasta with meat sauce, too, once she was full. That was also good, although nothing out of this world.   All of us were happy with our meal, and I'd definitely stop here again for an easy Italian meal.",

We opened with Fried Calamari with Cherry Peppers and Spicy Tomato Sauce, and received a requested Citrus Aioli to further supplement this well-constructed and tasty app.  At the same time I enjoyed excellent Housemade Meatballs finished off with Burata Cream.    For me, a bowl of Minestrone Soup was next up.  This classic Italian dish, prepared with roasted vegetables, Tubetti Pasta, and a touch of Basil Pine Nut Pesto, contained flavorful broth but it was not that well integrated with the vegetables.  A Caesar Salad with thin sheets of Mozzarella and requested anchovies boasted a Creamy Garlic Dressing, and was a nice prelude to the main course.  The quite generous portion of colorful Baked Lasagna Napoletana was as good as it looked, sporting excellent Sunday Meat Ragu Sauce, along with meatballs, pork, Smoked Mozzarella, and pine nuts.  Although Diane asked for Penne Alfredo to complement her Chicken Parmigiana Alfredo, she received Fettuccine Alfredo instead.  Both tasted fine, and she decided not to broach the issue any further.  Otherwise service and the work in the kitchen were very good.    A Trio of Gelati--Vanilla, Pistachio, and Chocolate--furnished a suitable ending to a memorable repast.   4-1/2 stars overall on this initial outing!",

We had - again - the pounded veal chop which can easily feed three people (I'm not kidding and I am not a light eater).  We also shared a pasta dish as an appetizer which the restaurant split for us (rather than serving it in one dish and leaving it to us).  Our server - Adam - could not have been nicer or more efficient.  Don't be scared off by the location off the casino floor; if you get a table in the back away from the \"windows\" you'll never know the casino is only feet away.",

Easily some of the best calamari I ever had.  The bread is decent - not the best I've ever had, but acceptable. The lasagna and rigatoni were both delicious (though on the pricey side - but hey, it's the Wynn).  The staff provided us with attentive service, and our water glasses were regularly topped off. The customer seating is a bit on the uncomfortable side.  If I were evaluating this restaurant solely based on palatability, service, and relative value, the score would probably be about 4 stars. However, enter the category of \"food safety\" ...  ... and on that note, I need to mention that my dining companion showed me what appeared to be a single strand of human hair that she found baked into her plate of lasagna (see the attached photos). What, did the chefs at Allegro mutiny and refuse to wear their ubiquitous chef hats?  Given the level of cleanliness and customer satisfaction that Steve Wynn clearly strives for (and mostly succeeds at), I was quite disappointed and shocked at this discovery. As you might imagine, I would not recommend patronizing this restaurant, and would suggest trying your luck at one of the other many dining establishments located within the Wynn/Encore (my experiences at Jardin, Wazuzu, and The Buffet were definitely more hygienic than the one I had at Allegro).   (*Or*, you can walk down the street and go eat at Tacos El Gordo. It was significantly cheaper, about as tasty, and we didn't find any strands of human hair in our food there.)",

Very impressed with the decor and ambiance. The only drawbacks for me are: 1. Super loud atmosphere 2. Tables are not intimate enough for a normal conversation because we were so far apart(they can pack a lot of guests in at one time thats for sure).  The food and service were excellent. Im in love with both pizzas we ordered. The Margherita and the Bosco Mushroom pizza were mouth watering! I did enjoy our appetizer of Calamari as it had jalapenos and red peppers mixed in to give it a spiciness. Most Delicious!  Im having those pizzas again! Which means Im going back soon! Highly Recommend.",

There were a few restaurants we had tried that gave excellent service but this establishment did not even come close to excellent.  Rude hostess in the front the first time I had ordered food there, but I decided to give it another try- maybe the hostess was just having a bad day??   Hmm.. same rude attitude and unwelcoming looks.  The food is pretty decent, very pricey and I am always willingly to pay for good food.... but terrible unwelcoming service? No thanks!  Coincidence that my review isn't the only one that doesn't have anything nice to say about the hostess...  But yet, Wynn and/or the restaurant still wants to keep rude personal in the front. I wonder why...?",

I thought it was going to be a bad experience because one of the hostesses started off with a slightly bad attitude.  Luckily, she turned it around quick, took my order and said it would be 10 min.  I came back 10 min later and she promptly walked to the bar, grabbed my pizza and handed it over with a smile (maybe the fact that actually tip on carry out, unlike some people, helped-haha).    Took the pie back to my room and started chowing down.  Pizza was great.  Excellent toppings and the vegan \"ricotta\" was super tasty.  Very thin, more like a flatbread, but I enjoyed it.  $20 may have been a bit steep, but hey, it's Vegas.",

She got the meatball pasta, which was amazing good kick to it.   They got great wine bottles, we let our server bring us a good red wine. Which was good.   Will I return?

Regardless, the end result is akin to the movie Downfall - a biopic of Hitler's last days: in Allegro's case, the totalitarian leader (manager Joel) and fearless demagogue, lets his own delusions of grandeur and conquest usher in the eventual destruction of all who believe in and now disavow him for the stark evil and ruthlessness he demonstrates night after night. If there was a way to dispute the charge to my card for our meal and drinks based on 'service not rendered due to crimes against humanity' I would do it.",

I went to the Wynn hotel specifically in search of a vegan friendly restaurant after reading online that every restaurant in the hotel had vegan options because Steve Wynn is a vegan.  I was not disappointed. The hotel was by far the more beautifully decorated for Christmas than any of the other hotels I had the chance to visit on the strip.  The wait staff knew exactly what was vegan without having to ask the chef. The meals were between $20-$40 for entrees with soups and salads in the $15 range. You could also see the menu on display before entering. As far as taste, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. It was good.  I will say that I have eat at a couple other restaurants in Vegas over the weekend (one vegan fast food and another high end restaurant that tried to cater to my diet), and this restaurant was the only one I left that I didn't feel like I may have had my food cross contaminated with animal products. As many vegans know this can make you ill. So for options, ambiance and knowledgeable staff this place deserves 3 stars. I would have rated higher if the food was exceptional and if the staff was a bit more enthusiastic about being there. I had the opportunity to interact with a few staff in the hotel, and all of them knew their jobs, but none seemed to really enjoy them.",

I asked the bartender what the best dessert is, and he said the pear cake so that is what we ordered. It was good. Not amazing. Not outrageously delicious. Just good. For $12, I would expect something more along the lines of: OFF the charts! The Sauv Blanc from New Zealand was also good, but could have bought a whole bottle for the price of one glass... then again, who is counting pennies while on vaca right?!

He picked for us, and we each got a glass of wine, a few small tasting appetizers, and two pastas.  Food was in general very good, though the seafood risotto can only be summarized by the word \"undunte\" as the rice was still raw! It was terrible. That went untouched. Other than that, the thin pizza with salmon and capers is fantastic. We had a small helping of eggplant parm, a ravioli, and some other items that were very nice.

I would not order again.   Last time I ordered the pasta with faux chicken. I enjoyed that. It was filling and tasty. I little heavy sitting in the belly. Priced at $31 dollars for one decent option is ok. Considering it was the Wynn my expectations are higher. The Wynn was my go to but now I think I am going to start looking for more progressive places to spend my money.   Last thing...the cafe across carries sweet and low and refined sugar.

    "text": "This restaurant is a gem and I don't know why their rating isn't higher. I had a great experience when I went.  There were 5 of us there, I thought the gentleman who came over was a waiter but turns out he was apparently the general manager. He took good care of us and even brought me a drink to try which was delicious by the way. So thank you for the great service.   As far as the food goes everything was delicious. I haven't had carpaccio and was a little iffy about it but it was so good. Flavorful and fresh, I wanted more once it was gone. The calamari was nice and crispy and the spicy marinara sauce (I think that's what it was) was really good and complemented it well. The pasta was once again nice and flavorful. The meatballs were huge and filling. I have never tried branzino before, I tend to stick to fish I have tried before and know that I like. But I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it a lot. It was seasoned well and didn't have a super fishy taste like some other types of fish do. I enjoyed it a lot. I didn't eat the pizza but my group ordered 2 of them and ate every single bite so I'm assuming it was good.   Lastly both of the drinks were delicious. The cosmo was strong but you couldn't really taste the alcohol which made it even better. I was very happy with both beverages. Overall, I had a great experience and I am glad I found this place so that I can go again!",

The waiter kept pressuring me to get drinks even when I told him I was ok with my water.  All the buzz boys were very polite  Not coming back obviously  One last comment  It really bothered me that although the restaurant wasn't full at all they refused to give me a 4 people table claiming they were reserved ( no one showed up btw ) so yeah , there you have it",

It was open late so we were excited...most of us got the super thin crust pizzas (pepperoni and arugula etc) along with eggplant parmesan & a salad. The pizza was very thin I could have eaten the whole thing but we split it with a friend lol. Next time I am getting my own no splitsy! The water servers were on point & always came by to refill our water. At the end of the night we asked to have our bills individually split but she took the entire total bill and split it btwn all 5 of us. So two of us ended up paying more then we ate. Nor too happy about that not sure why that was so confusing. Otherwise I would go again for some thin crust pizza.",

    "text": "Whether modern times respect Steve Wynn or not is irrelevant, without his contributions Las Vegas would unlikely be what it is today, and on Saturday night the eponymous resort now run by ex-wife Elaine again showed well from the spectacle of XS Nightclub to the underappreciated Italian Cuisine of Chef Enzo Febbraro at Allegro.  Now part of the Wynn-Encore complex since 2012, Alex Stratta's departure opening a door for what is currently the property's closest approximation of an \"all-night\" eatery, it is beginning at 5:00pm on weekdays and an hour earlier on weekends that guests are welcome in the main dining room, its proximity to both gaming and garage largely unnoticeable from all but a few tables.    Enjoyed once previously four years prior, the Food that Enzo learned to cook in his native Naples a combination of rustic and refined with the broad appeal necessary for resort clientele, it was with Chef Febbraro currently overseas that Allegro was found bustling, a Sous named Amanda on the line at 9:00pm with she and her team in the process of cooking for at least a hundred guests, plus a soon-arriving surge from Encore Theater.  Maintaining a collection of classics alongside seasonal updates, $15-23 for Appetizers and $28-49 for Mains a veritable bargain in comparison to the prices at SW Steakhouse or Mizumi, it was opting for the Chef's tasting that trust was placed in Allegro's tiny kitchen, a basket featuring two styles of Bread not the best beginning as both a Tomato Roll and sliced Ciabatta were dry and an unjustified use of stomach space even after being dipped in garlicky Olive Oil.  Quick to improve, a modified version of Allegro's Caprese Salad adding Prosciutto to housemade Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, it was alongside this that Octopus with light char found balance in snappy vegetables and Citrus, the simultaneously presented Margherita Pizza also enjoyable thanks to vibrant Sauce and creamy Cheese atop a Crust that is truly \"Cracker-thin.\"  Up-selling their Meatballs, a different presentation than 2015 making \"Signature\" status questionable even though the blend of Beef and Pork is exquisitely tender, it should come as no surprise that all Pasta is made on-site, tubes of Paccheri currently offered al dente with a plethora of Crab plus Pesto while ribbons of Pappardelle stand up nicely to hearty Pink Sauce cooked down slowly with Pork and Chili Peppers.  Skipping four types of Parmigiana, everything from Gardein Chick'n with Vegan Mozz to a $49 Veal Chop available, it was instead with Mediterranean Sea Bass and Steak cooked medium that savories concluded, each simple yet satisfying while sweets saw Gelato, Tiramisu and a Chocolate-Raspberry Tart all good but the Baba au Rhum again an unassuming spotlight-stealer thanks to plenty of booze but enough Whipped Cream and Fruit to make it work.  ****1/2:  Reportedly serving \"more than a quarter million guests\" yearly, and still going strong despite the shutter of Italian stalwarts at both ends of Las Vegas Boulevard, Allegro remains the same treasure it was described as the last time, even with the Chef on vacation and the dining room near maximum capacity.",

Ordered calamari and Cesar salad to start. Calamari was less than stellar and probably wouldn't get it again. There were only a couple pieces of calamari and the rest of the bowl was filled with fried carrot and veggie strings... basically filler food. Disappointing dish and wouldn't recommend it. Cesar salad, on the other hand, was simple but well made and was a big enough portion to share between two people.   For my entree, I ordered the lasagna and I am not usually a fan of lasagna  but this one one was amazing. There were chunks of shredded beef that was super soft and juicy and the sauce was savory and delicious. It was the perfect amount of cheese and layers as well. I didn't anticipate I was going to finish my dish but I ate it clean! Def recommend it!  Only other complaint about this place is that it is expensive, but then again everything in the Wynn is, so be prepared to shell out a pretty penny!",

I was a little scared to eat here at first because I had a bad experience at another restaurant on the Wynn property where the price was really out there compared to the quality. I was back at the Wynn to have dinner with my relatives so I kept an open mind. I'm glad I did!   The first thing that blew me away was their bread basket. The spread which tasted like a decadent butter was actually healthy. I think the waiter said it was made of yogurt. I've never tasted a yogurt like this. The whole table was impressed!   I started with the Arugula salad ($15)  . When I order salad it's either a Arugula or a Beet salad that draws me in. It had orange, fennel, shaved Parmesan and a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was simple but the flavors of everything combined was excellent! My main course was the Rigatoni and Meatballs ($28) . The meatballs were a mixture of beef and pork which goes well together! The portions were decent for the pricing.   The service was very attentive and friendly. It was perfect for a family outing because it isn't too loud in there so you can enjoy each others company and conversation without yelling over loud music.",

I tried about 4 different pasta dishes and they were all great. Meatballs usually give me heart burn and this one didn't. I guess it was actually made of real meat and not mostly filler breadcrumbs.

Your meal comes with bread and it was great as well. I ordered the chicken Parmigiana and it was fantastic! It was the size of a small pizza... It was huge!  It also comes with a large side of pasta. The dish could really be split in two and be shared. They were proud on the price of the dish but with the quantity and quality of the food I'd say it was fair.   The worst part of the Dinner was the crappy seating. They have these beautiful red leather chairs that just absolutely are terrible. They are narrow and the seat leans forward. In my opinion it was that bad.   Overall:   -2 Star for crappy chairs  Yes I recommend going it was delicious!  Yes I'll be back! Hopefully the will get new chairs!",

    "text": "After our night out, my boyfriend and I were hungry for a meal and Allegro was the only restaurant open in the Wynn/Encore hotels. We ordered a caprese salad, meatballs, and cavatelli pasta. I wasn't really expecting it to be THAT good, maybe because it was 2 am and usually restaurants open that late are mediocre at best. However, everything was more than up to par with any Italian food that I've had at a nice restaurant. The pasta was especially delicious and tasted homemade. The cavatelli dish had broccolini and sausage and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The meatballs were also great, with a flavorful and bright tomato sauce. We ended with a dessert, the only dish that I got a picture of. It was a raspberry chocolate cake/mousse that was both beautiful and delicious!  Our meal Allegro was one of the best dinners I've had in a while. The only negative about our experience was that the service was a little slow, despite the restaurant not being too busy. That being said, I'll definitely be back again on my next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "This was my second time at Allegro. The first time was two years ago when we got to the hotel late due to horrendous traffic (they had to land a helicopter on the freeway to rescue someone who had a medical emergency - not complaining; at least that wasn't me in the helicopter). Since it was too late to go anywhere else, we decided to check out Allegro purely based on the description in the in-room dining guide. The food then, we now, was amazing. There were 3 of us so we sampled a number of dishes. My favorite was the Bianca pizza. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FLiterally.changed.my.life&s=10e236d14ded4754ee46440e87737ef79ab0c9f1e71345ea80c38da2b342faaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Literally.changed.my.life</a>. I've been on a 2 year prosciutto kick ever since that pizza. This time around, we headed straight for Allegro for an early dinner. Their meatballs and sauce are amazing. At $18 for 2 meatballs, it seemed pricey, but they were so good. Unlike most restaurant sauces, their sauce is not overly sweet. For the main course, my husband ordered the veal parmesan. It was the size of the plate!  I was tempted to order my favorite pizza again but my husband convinced me to try to lobster far diavolo. The spicy tomato sauce was actually spicy, and the dish came with a whole lobster tail, a claw, and 3 large shrimp. For $48, it seemed about right. Because we stuffed ourselves with the pre-meal bread (which was delicious with their house-made oil mixture), having the full meal left me disgustingly full. So of course we ordered dessert. The gelato trio was exceptional for $11. I've never had pistachio, and this was delicious. The chocolate and vanilla were also really good. The hubs ordered a boozy coffee, which he said was very strong. The service was outstanding. They were just attentive enough to have our needs met but also gave us plenty of time to enjoy our meal. We had leftovers packed up, and I was already wondering how we were going to eat it in our hotel room. They thought if that too. The leftovers bag contained 2 forks and 2 knives.   Overall, loved this place. We plan on coming back for the pizza before the end of this trip. They do offer it carry out as needed.",

The server/staff was friendly, and for the most part the staff were attentive; they meticulously documented my uncles food allergies and adjusted accordingly.   After the complimentary bread with olive oil (but no fresh parmesan offered), I ordered the hearty minestrone soup and the veal chop parmesan.   Minestrone soup had a better broth than my recent outing at Milo in Olive in Santa Monica -- and at the same price.  The veal chop parmesan was incredibly taxing to the wallet, and served a la carte, but thankfully my uncle was paying for it.   I however, Falsely assumed that this dish came with a side of pasta, but that was the CHICKEN PARMESAN, NOT VEAL. At nearly fifty dollars though, most Italian restaurants throw in a complimentary pasta side, and with Allegro this should be no exception considering the Las Vegas Strips premium for fine dining.  For dessert, since it was my birthday, they brought me a complimentary cross-sample of the tiramisu cake. Small, but beggars can't be choosers I suppose.  3/5",

For this restaurant they will confirm which room you're staying in so you can have either the option to charge it on your hotel bill or pay normally.  Very elegant, and very presentable from the outside in and even on the tables with their silverware and folded up napkin.  The service was very professional considering that it's located inside a very nice hotel.  But when it comes down to the food, I was not impressed nor my friends.  We all felt that it very bland and just attracted the customers by its nice scenery.  If we had the option we would've ate elsewhere, but we were starving and that was the closest restraunt we knew of.  If you can make the drive or walk to another restraunt within the area, I'd reccomend it.  You might get better food, but kudos to the service indeed.  Slightly dim inside, and they have a pretty extensive wine menu if you fancy wine.",

Had the shrimp ravioli and it was good but nothing special, which is sort of the vibe going in the restaurant -- good but nothing special. Nice spices and and good bay shrimp garnished the ravioli, but the ravioli themselves were sort of rubbery and had an unpleasant texture. 5/5 for the service of Allegro, and 2/5 on the food, even the bread basket we got was cold, and if you're in the Wynn and want some good eatings consider Bartolotta but dress appropriately or one will be denied access.",

Not sure why since there were plenty of open tables but they were showing the NCAA championship at the bar so can't really complain.  Ordered a Caesar salad and their rib eye steak.  Caesar was good no complaints but the steak was definitely not worth the price.  For $44, they had some tomatoes and a cheese layer on top which I'm assuming is there to make up for the lack of quality.  Wasn't the worst, but definitely average.  Wasn't cooked to my request. I asked for medium rare but most of it was medium.  Didn't have time to send it back so I tried to make the best of it.  I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because of the bartenders.  They are really attentive and want to make sure you're taken care of.  Really impressed by them.  Im sure I should've gotten a pizza but I had no time to go elsewhere and I was wanting a steak for the one day I was in Vegas on this particular trip, just thought being in the Wynn food quality would've been better.",

    "text": "From a Celiac:  The Good: The boyfriend loves this place. He loves the ambiance of being right inside the casino and watching all the action. He loves eating a great meal at 2:00am. The wine list is stellar. The risotto is his favorite.  All of Steve Wynn's restaurants have menus that have each allergy listed and what is ok to eat according to your allergy. Awesome!   The Bad: I'm going to skip to the ugly...  The Ugly: I ordered a really delicious glass of wine with GLUTEN FREE pasta with plain marinara sauce. No appetizers. No salad. I've done this before, it's always very good.   I didn't realize that I would be reminded of this meal for the next 2 weeks at the time. But waking up a few hours after this meal I knew what had happened. I had been given wheat pasta. I woke with a bloody mouth, open bloody sores on my tongue and roof of my mouth and raw gums. By the end of the day I had a rash on my face and had spent the day dealing with having bloody vomit and diarrhea. Nice.   Servers that aren't Celiacs don't know what can happen by giving someone a wheat meal. I remember being a server and one lady ordered decaf coffee. I brought some over and she asked if I was confident enough that it was decaf to give her my phone number so if it did have caffeine she would call me in the middle of the night. I brewed a new pot of decaf, just to make sure.   For people who really are Celiacs, eating out is terrifying. It is not a \"fad\" or diet for us. It is real. It's been 2 weeks since eating at Allegro and I am still having complications from that stupid wheat pasta.   I know I will have to eat here again because we always stay at Encore and the boyfriend loves it. But I don't trust the servers/kitchen here so I'll be ordering plain lettuce, with no dressing next time.",

    "text": "Hats off to the chef.  Came here a few weeks ago with a big party. Set menu at an Italian restaurant not of my choice but went with the group. Had I known it was Italian I would have said something to them.   4 course meal ceasar salad, chicken Marsala, alfredo pasta and tiramisu for desert.  They asked about allergies. That's was nice. I spoke up and the chef made me my own 4 course meal without hesitation.  Salad with a different type of dressing, a gluten free version of the Marsala chicken, gluten free pasta with tomatoes and a tapioca pudding with mango and kiwi for desert. It was so yummy too.. 5 stars in my book for quality of food and service.",

    "text": "WTF!!! The service here is HORRIBLE! I'm sitting in here right now. We ordered the Caesar salad like 10 minutes ago as well as the vegan chicken pasta and they have tons of workers here. I have been watching my salad sit under a heating lamp and numerous servers and food runners stare at it and walk by. I thought the salads were supposed to be cold. I also thought that this was a five-star hotel. Sure doesn't seem like it. Extremely disappointed in this place. You guys need to train your workers better. I've been in the serving industry for a long time and we are all supposed to help eachother. I watched at least  12 workers walk by and since I'm not their table they didn't get the food out. Meanwhile, my $14 salad is cooking. BYE FELICIA!!  Now I just tried to send the salad back and I feel like they just put the soggy lettuce back in the refrigerator. Our salad tastes like it just got pulled out of a hot car!",

The portion was huge, and the prosciutto silky and fresh. We opted for the extra olives/eggplant/pickled onion combo. Our superb waiter, Jack, allowed us to sub another portion of olives for the onions. He was very helpful with wine suggestions and brought two samples, unasked. It was busy, and Jack was really attentive to all of his tables. We appreciate such professional service! Back to the food! The grilled bread with the fresh mozzarella and the delicious small marinated tomato halves was perfect! We also shared the rigatoni and meatballs. I usually don't order pasta, but this was al dente and also   exceptionally tasty. Lots leftover for today!   We had a good bottle of wine, a delicious meal for a fair price (on the Strip) for high quality ingredients. Thanks, Jack, for adding to the enjoyable evening!",

    "text": "A big miss at the Wynn.  Let me start by saying I'm not a big reviewer, I will only write these if something was so extremely disappointing I feel compelled to warn others. I'm not a unreasonable nit picky food snob either. This place just missed every mark across the board. Service was decent, and apparently whoever was there previously making guests life hell has been removed.   Love the Wynn, have eaten at several places there and finally decided to try Allegro in lieu of Nove at Palms (due to the unfortunate demise taking place at that hotel) and unfortunately, for the first time was extremely disappointed by something at the Wynn.  We did the Chefs Table and the only thing that was good was the Calamari and Caesar Salad. Very disappointing for a \"Italian\" establishment and the price. You could close your eyes and eat the egg plant or a spoonful of salt and wouldn't know the difference in what you were eating.   The meatballs? Rubbery spongy and simply not authentic, you will know what I mean the second you bite in. My girlfriend referred to it as \"spammy\" which is pretty accurate. I make my own meatballs with 5 ingredients and it absolutely destroys these, it's not hard!  The steak was pretty good, pasta was so-so and cold, and the dessert mediocre. It's just simply not worth the price and a good example of using the name and establishment to significantly overcharge.   The seating is definitely a bit odd as well. I would simply avoid this place, it will give you a bad impression of the Wynn. I kept telling my girlfriend that everything at that hotel is excellent, and then this happened. Very unfortunate. Glad I hit a decent progressive jackpot there and walked away with my money plus more.",

    "text": "A-MAZ-ING!!!!! I can't say enough great things about this place! I stayed at the Wynn this past weekend with my husband for our anniversary. We booked the trip exclusively because we got one of those mailers earlier this year which mentioned a package with free Le Reve tickets and a complimentary meal if you stayed for at least two nights. The rate was pretty good so even though we aren't Vegas people, we booked it and were very happy that we did (I'll write a review for the hotel later and stick to the food on this review.   We chose this place while waiting in The Buffet line earlier that day. Wynn has a great app that shows a couple of their menus and since we were seeing Le Reve that night we picked Allegro because it has a specific menu meant to be had before the show. The app doesn't include all of the onsite restaurants and I was having a little bit of remorse heading into dinner here rather than at one of the more high-end onsite restaurants since the space opens right up into the casino, but when we approached the hostess I just asked to be seated further into the room and they were happy to accommodate. Once seated, I totally forgot we were only maybe 100 feet from the casino. The lighting was very romantic and the music choice was very different, but nonetheless great (it went from 80s to current, throw in some country, and then even a light reggae song- it liked it all, but my husband and I noted during the meal that it was an odd mix of songs).  When our waiter, Adam, came we were still debating what to order. The Le Reve menu in person differed a little from the menu on the app, but it still sounded great so I just needed to decide on an entree and pick a good wine to pair with it. I love wine so I am open to trying something new and Adam recommended the Chianti. As much of a wine lover as I consider myself, I have never tried a Chianti so I told him I'd love a taster before committing. He ended up bringing a couple options for me to try so I could ensure that I had the best wine for my meal. I ended up loving the Chianti and the chef even gave the wine at a very reduced price since he was so certain that it was be the best choice for the meal and wanted to make my decision that much easier.  The Le Reve meal is $45/person and you must have at least 2 people ordering from that menu. They serve all of the appetizers to you and each person gets to pick a main entree. The chef curates the meal so you can't customize it, but he is a talented chef who knows what he is doing so customization isn't necessary. I went with the veal marsala and my husband went with the chicken parm. The apps were amazing! I monopolized the Caesar salad while my husband devoured the meatballs. The dressing was great and you could tell that they make it fresh. The eggplant parm was great too as was the bruschetta. They gave us enough time to enjoy our apps without feeling rushed to the main course, while also not giving us too much time to sit with leftovers in front of us. When dinner came I got a second glass of wine (which was served with a very generous pour) and the food was amazing!!! My veal was a little more cooked than I prefer (but I like my steak rare, not medium-rare, I want that thing marinating in it's own blood), but like I said, the chef seemed to have a vision for the meal and he delivered. The entrees were delicious and the wine pairing was perfect!  Going into dinner, I had mentioned to Adam that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and that I wanted to see if that could do something special for us to celebrate. Also, right before the entrees came out I asked him if he knew of any classy yet relaxing places to listen to classic music and smoke a cigar. He got really excited about my question and after a couple of minutes came back with recommendations. When desert came, he brought our biscotti along with a chocolate cigar. Apparently they had them for a special event and since I mentioned our search for a cigar bar he figured that would be a cute dessert. He was totally right and it was perfect.  In summation, the restaurant was a perfect mix of romantic, classy, and intimate, the staff was accommodating and friendly, and the food and drinks were perfectly designed to compliment each other through the entirety of the meal. At the end of our meal I had some leftovers and they were happy to package it up for us. I ended up with some extra wine as well (that heavy pour gave me more than I was ready for at dinner) and Adam was happy to get me a glass that I could walk into the casino and even into Le Reve with so I didn't have to spend an arm and a leg on the wine cost in there. I already spoke with the manager directly about how great our service was, but I would HIGHLY recommend this place especially to anyone on there was to Le Reve (It is only about 100 yards from the showroom).",

What's the difference? new chef and HIGHER prices.    * le sigh. it's Vegas, right? *   I've always gotten their linguini pasta every time I'm here, it's perfectly al dente with lots of Manila clams in a white wine garlic butter sauce.  It's simple, familiar and frankly, when you're drinking in Vegas, you'll want to have a tummy full of good eats.   Their beef carpaccio is nicely accented with capers and creme fraiche, while the bf's ribeye is so mouthwateringly desirable.   I hate that they charge you $10 for a \"tiramisu\"  but it's nothing like the real thing!  it's served in a short glass with lady fingers layered with marscapone and chocolate. I'd say, skip this and order another a digestif instead.  Not going to be my first choice when dining at the Wynn.",

Why? I can't tell you, they just are. Flavor, texture, freshness, it's all perfect.  The downside, wings aren't available until 3am unless you pay extra (to equal a dinner entree price).",

The staff was very helpful in accommodating our large group, seating us in three smaller tables, and making sure we were all well taken care of. Our beverages were always full, bread for the table came in a variety basket and served warm, and appetizers came out very timely.   For dinner, I ordered the Gardein Chicken Parm...it was very tasty! While I do prefer vegetarian meals over eating animal products, I was a little hesitant as I've had a less than pleasant experience with Vegan cheese at a pizza shop in LA. However, the Vegan cheese was delicious and I was so happy with my meal!   The only thing our table thought was quite interesting was our appetizer pizza came out within 2-3 minutes of our order. We were all happy about that because we were hungry, but it was also questionable as to why it came out so early.",

Plus while we were there they repeated the same show once, maybe we took too long to eat... but it was only 2 hours. It was a pretty psychadelic show that would have been FANTASTIC on mushrooms. So that may be a suggestion, but they don't sell that kind at the restaurant unfortunately.  The food was pretty solid though, most of the table ordered the Prime Rib which was kind of their signature dish but I ordered the filet. I asked for rare plus but got medium rare closer to the medium side. Not a huge deal but annoying. The steak was tasty but not the greatest steak I've ever had before. It passed. What was amazing was the side dishes. I had the whipped potatoes and crab cake mac and cheese both of which were super good.   If you're looking for a solid meal within the Wynn that's not super expensive or upscale this is probably a good choice. Lively atmosphere makes this a good choice for groups too.",

I probably would go back; it's a little (SLIGHTLY) more affordable than other sit down restaurants in/on/around the strip",

    "text": "I think this Vegas trip was just mediocre all around. We ate at Allegro on Friday night around 8:30. The best part about this restaurant was that we didn't have to wait. The drinks are overprice - as is everything in Vegas, and the food was just okay. I ordered a wood-fire pizza (again almost 30 dollars for about 6 slices of cheese pizza is INSANE), and it was good, not great. My friend ordered the bruschetta app and it looked AMAZING. It had fresh mozzarella, balsamic, arugula, the whole nine yards and was probably worth the price. Another friend with a food allergy ordered just a salad, but they took her food allergies very seriously - which was reassuring. My drink was off of the cocktail menu and I was pleasantly surprised with how strong it was considering I was paying 17 dollars for it.  Overall, if you need something quick and sort of nice and you don't want to leave the Wynn, this is your place, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",

I am a big fan of Italian food, have been in Italy several times and can absolutely assure you that Alegro's quality of food beats many places even in Italy. The Bosca pizza is must try ( roasted pureed mushrooms, ricotta cheese and truffle oil) so is the eggplant Parmesan , veal Parmesan, veal Marsala and the carpaccio. We come to Vegas often and always dine in there once or twice per visit. It's also open till early morning, so it's definitely the best place to eat after most of the Restaurants have closed.

Allegro's proximity to the La Reve show makes this an easy to get to after show dining spot, which is exactly what we did. Its just across from the ticket counter.   I had heard the meatballs were the go-to item, and they didn't disappoint. The portion was out of control big is my only complaint. I only ate about 30% of the pasta, which made me feel so wasteful! The meatballs were very flavorful and I think you get three or four large meatballs.   The margherita pizza was one of the best I have had! It was so authentic and the thin crust was perfect. It tasted just like pizza in Italy that I had many years ago, it took me back! The pear cosmopolitan was very good and strong, just like I like it!  We had excellent service too. Our waiter was friendly, checked on us, and brought us delicious breads. YUM. I loved it!",

The menu showed that it comes with lobster, so I only expected tiny bits, but it came with a large amount. The service was excellent.

They delivered the food and asked nothing. By the time I flagged someone down to get it, the food was already cold. The manager did make things right and actually took our entrees off of our bill, so I give him props for that, as we didn't ask for that. All and all, not bad for some quick flatbread pizza, but maybe try Sinatra's for a better Italian experience.",

    "text": "So I was meeting friends from out of town at the Wynn. They suggested we just stay at the Wynn for some drinks, appetizers, and great conversations catching up in life. Allegro is someplace that they have been too few times during their stay this trip so why not. It was the first time for me.   Talk about great service and even better memory from the hostess. Like mention before my friends been here couple times already. So as soon as we were getting seated she mention remember the name and just something hardly see restaurant takes notice of repeat customers.  Overall our waiter was very attentive giving us time too order knowing that we were more about conversation then eating. Never empty glass of beer or mixed drink the whole time. We went just for appetizers and drinks. Not problem. The menu is your standard Italian fare  high end strip $$. I let my friends order since they been here few times. We got the beef carpaccio and meatball pizza. The beef carpaccio was nice. It was refreshing too see carpaccio not about bunch of stuff under or topped off. It was simple just shaved parm, nice wild mushroom of some sort, and seasonings on top. One that with each bite can taste majority beef just the accent of the toppings. The pizza very thin crust style pizza or could call it new york style. I liked the meatballs nice flavor, moist, and juicy on the inside cooked properly. The tomato sauce felt like could have had more flavor. Overall would say solid pizza but thin crust style had better at other restaurants. The bread basket like the assortment.   Allegro definitely has your upscale Wynn feeling too it. The chairs really comfortable and talk about heavy. It takes effort too push your chair in more less when your about too leave. seriously. Thankfully its open kitchen because nothing inside terms of decor that really makes it stand out.   I feel better Italian high end places on the strip or outside the strip. I would be open too going back trying more of the menu.",

    "text": "Tuesday's Restaurant Week dinner was at Allegro inside Wynn. It took over the space that was formerly Stratta. Alessandro (of TC Masters fame) got the boot. Chef Enzo Febbraro was highly regarded in Washington DC and hails from Naples. The restaurant has only been open a short time, but it's already getting great praises.   Our table for three wasn't ready when we arrived so we ordered wine at the bar. $42 for three glasses: riesling and pinot grigio. They later seated us in the bar area, which I found a bit odd since this area is generally reserved for those without reservations. The restaurant week menu had three choices for each course. We decided we'd each order something different and share so we could sample a bit of everything. One of the entree choices was spaghetti and meatballs, but we learned while the restaurant does make its own pasta it does not make its spaghetti. Odd. We wanted to try homemade pasta so the waiter asked the kitchen if we could substitute the lasagna. They approved, yay.   For the first course we had Bianca Pizza Mozzarella; Proscuitto, Arugula, Shaved Parmesan, Panzanella Salad; Tomato, Cucumber, Celery, Red Onion, Double-Baked Fresella, Red Wine Vinaigrette and Calamari & Shrimp; Fried Calamari, Shrimp, and Cherry Peppers, Spicy Tomato Sauce. The Bianca pizza was fantastic. Crisp crust, gooey cheese and topped with Proscuitto and Arugula it reminded me of the flavors we enjoyed while in Italy. The Calamari was very good as well. Tender and lightly breaded with a kick... just the way I like it. The Panzanella was a bit bland and the weakest dish.   Next up was Roasted Pink Snapper; Escabeche of Vegetables, Salmoriglio Sauce, Chicken Parmigiano; Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella and Baked Lasagna Napoletana; Meat Ragu, Meatballs, Smoked Mozzarella. The snapper was delicate and nicely prepared. The pickled vegetables were much too pickled for my liking, though. The Lasagna was very meaty. Too meaty. I've heard raves over this lasagna but it didn't thrill us. I'm not one who enjoys chicken parmigiano, in all honestly, chicken dishes in general don't appeal to me, but this was excellent. It was giant breast well seasoned with light crisp breading. The sauce wasn't acidic. We agreed it was likely the best any of us has had. Who knew?   And finally, dessert offered a Cannoli; Sweet Ricotta Cheese, Candied Citrus, Chocolate Shavings, Cassata Frozen Nougat, Raspberry & Meringue Sorbet and Tiramisu; Mascarpone Mousse, Coffee Soaked Lady Fingers, Chocolate Liqueur. The cannoli was not liked by any of us. It was heavily orange flavored. My bite brought back memories of spoonfuls of Trix as a kid. The Cassata was nicely done, but it was the Tiramisu that wooed us. It's right up there with the one made by angels at Circo.   Overall, we enjoyed a delicious meal. Service was great until the very end when it took forever to close out our check. Being held hostage is a definite pet peeve, but our waiter did go above and beyond to see about getting lasagna so it was forgiven.",

They were well informed of my food allergies and polite.  Good service, nice restaurant, BUT the food was TERRIBLE!!!  I ordered a GF Caesar Salad and my friends ordered pizza.  Everything we tried was not good at all.  Maybe it had something to do with the time of our meal?  Late night - early morning?  All I know is the $88 spent was a waste",

Let me just say that the bread and garlic spread they bring out at the beginning of the meal are TO DIE FOR!  For all of you carb-concious ladies out there... SUCK IT UP AND EAT THE BREAD; you will regret it if you don't.  Margherita Pizza = large, super thin, amazing Calamari = not very big of a portion, great dipping sauce, standard breading Caesar Salad = big, great for sharing, mild in the garlic department Seafood Risotto = not as good as you would think, tomato sauce base, not creamy, strong seafood flavour (on the tasting menu but don't let that fool you), expensive.  The atmosphere, service, and prosecco we all awesome; the hostess team is really friendly and fun to talk to.  Don't go in wearing sweatpants, but not over-the top fancy either.  Bread and pizza.

    "text": "Where do I even start? I've been to most of the restaurants in the Wynn, and the hotel remains my favorite place to stay on the strip and USUALLY my favorite place for fine dining. My parents accompanied me on this trip to celebrate my mothers birthday, and since they love Italian food I figured we would try Allegro. Upon requesting a table, Joel the manager all but ignored me. I figured he just hadn't heard what I was saying, so I spoke louder. Without even looking in my direction, he waved me away like I was some sort of peasant. My mother seemed upset but a hostess soon apologized and seated us. By the look on her face, I got the impression she has to apologize for her boss quite often.  My mother orders the Margherita pizza. The waitress brings her a pepperoni pizza. I tried to send it back as my mother is a lifetime vegetarian (for religious reasons). The waitress is about to take the plate away as Joel comes up and asks us what the problem is. I explain that there must have been a mix up, as my mother is a vegetarian. I could not believe his response. \"Take it or leave it, we're very busy tonight.\" Then walks away. No replacement, no apology. We had to pick the peperonis off her pizza. The meal ended with my mother in tears and her birthday ruined.  If the owners of the restaurant are reading this, please fire this manager. He is a disgrace to the Wynn and has no business being around people, let alone in the hospitality industry. He will get another job, but my mother will not get another 67th birthday. It was the low point of our trip and the worst dining experience I have had in Vegas. Joel, if you're reading this, shame on you.",

The hostess with the mostest with the tight black dress that *barely* covered her a## cheeks asked if we were guests of the hotel (no, hotel next door) and promptly sat us in the far back at a wobbly table, next to a family with 5 kids and another with 1. If I wanted baby land I'd go to Circus Circus.   We asked for, and received, a different table from the captain.   Next minor strike was that my Moscow mule wasn't served properly.   I ordered the Big Eye Tuna - rare. I WAS SERVED TUNA THAT WAS NOT SUSHI GRADE.  Seriously. If you are a restaurant serving tuna to someone who orders it rare (and requested it as raw as the chef is willing to serve it), you sure better have sushi grade fish that isn't riddled with gristle like deposits that make it inedible.   My mother's steak was delicious by her account.   Espresso martini was very good.   Server was average and treated our table like an afterthought. I think he was in the weeds a bit.   Tuna was not good. I should have sent it back, but had already switched tables and didn't want to be \"that' customer.   Just skip this place. It's pretentious and trying too hard to be hip.",

On the card it was not mentioned that there is something else fried with it. I took a bite, of what I though was a bell pepper and damn it was spicy, a jalapeno pepper slice. Are you kidding me, you think this should not be mentioned on the card to inform the people?!  The Chicken Parmigana was good, what really bothered me tho was the tomato sauce on the chicken and the one on the pasta were 2 different ones. That's a total no go. Please make sure the sauce is the same and use the one from the Pasta, because that one was really awesome.  My husband wanted a regular espresso after dinner. He asked for one. Instead of a espresso, the waiter brings a card with everything on it but a regular espresso, that's when we decided he dosen't need one.",

The Bosco came with an unbelievable portobello (?) mushroom puree and ricotta cheese. Both were absolutely scrumptious, albeit slightly more pricey than your average pizza.

    "text": "OK. So, this place upset me tremendously, from the moment we arrive. Let me explain what happened:  We arrived for our 5pm reservation, as we had an early flight, at 4:55pm. 5 minutes before they were \"officially\" open. Though, there was service in the bar, the host refused to seat us at our table for 5 minutes, while we waited for service to finish their set up. The host, did offer us a seat at the bar, but I was already thinking about where I would rather spend my money, than spend it on a place that refused to seat someone 5 minutes early. Not usually a big deal, except the early party included me, and an 84 year old guest of mine. And the tables were cleaned and set. I could see them, and pointed at the tables, to the host.    I was truly upset about this and complaining while we went to the closest roulette table to sit down for 5 minutes, in which, we were AGAIN told to move (another story, for another time).   Secondly, when our dining companions arrived, the host made a big show of how our dining companions, (whom had the early flight) had luggage, and weren't allowed on the dining room floor with their luggage. What the fuck? You're a mediocre restaurant in a hotel. You expect people to not have luggage in Las Vegas? One of the most heavily touristed cities in the world? In a hotel, in which people stay, and bring luggage, in and out, on a LITERALLY DAILY basis, you're going to luggage-shame us?   I don't understand how luggage is disruptive to one's dining experience, unless you embarrass the guest's with the luggage. I don't understand how luggage might be disruptive to another guest's dining experience unless those with luggage are wholly inconsiderate and put the luggage on someone else's table. I don't how purses, backpacks and shoulder bags are any less disruptive than a couple of wheel-y bags. (If someone could please message me, and explain to me this etiquette I would greatly appreciate it. Also, will be forced to retract these last 2 paragraphs of this review.)  I was always taught that first impressions are the most important. And on 2 separate, EARLY occasions to impress a diner, they basically told us to fuck ourselves. Twice.  That being said, the ambience, food and service was fine, but I was already super pissed, and too frustrated to give the 3 other components to our meal a fair review.",

    "text": "Five of us came here for dinner and Executive Chef Enzo Febbraro came to talk to us as we perused the menu.  He asked if we wanted him to just send out dishes, put them in the center of the table, and enjoy them family style.  We agreed to that.  Some table leaves were raised so we had more room for the 5 of us with plenty of room in the middle for our dishes.  We were given bread service and instead of butter, we were served this very tasty garlic creamy spread that was very good.    In short order, we started with the appetizers.  We got eggplant parmigiana, calamari which contained some fried peppers and tomatoes and was served with a very spicy, very good tomato sauce.  We also got a platter of mozzarella that contained burrata, stracchino, bufala mozzarella along with two kinds pf prosciutto and some Italian tomatoes.  This was shortly followed by some meatballs in tomato sauce and a focaccia pizza which had mozzarella, creme fraiche, smoked salmon, chives, and red onion.    Moving on to the entree type plates, we got this huge--think the size of a large round pizza--bone in veal chop parmigiana.  The menu lists it as 12 ounces, but it had to be a lot more than that.  It was huge!  We also got osso buco with pappardelle and vegetable stew.  Accompanying these two dish were a lasagna and seafood risotto.    We ended with four desserts--tiramisu, pear ricotta tart,  pannetone bread pudding, and baba au rhum.  Standout dishes for me were the calamari and the hot tomato sauce.  There was a lot of red pepper in the sauce and it had great zing to it.  The mozzarella platter with prosciutto was another good dish.  The osso buco was good and the pappardelle and sauce from the osso buco was very tasty.  The pounded veal parmigiana was good but I'm not that big a fan of veal parmigiana.  I credit Chef Febbraro with not breading his dishes to death.  The calamari and veal were nicely breaded.    I did not try the baba au rhum because one of my dining mates let me know it was infused heavily with rum.  The other three desserts were good with the pear ricotta tart being the best.  The amount of food we ate and the heaviness of the dishes filled us all.  It was a fine dinner with the chef sending out some of his chosen dishes.",

    "text": "Allegro is the only spot open until 6 AM at the Wynn so it is an ideal location to grab late night, casual Italian eats and also tame the random after-hours dessert cravings.   Our server was attentive and courteous to us even though we only wanted to order only from the dessert menu: A short list consisting of 9 decadent items, covering all of the sweet tooth needs. You have the traditional Italian delights: tiramisu, affogato, panna cotta, rum cake, panetTone bread pudding, cookie and truffles, a small array of gelato, sorbets or even a vegan tart.    My fiance and I started with a refreshing and light dessert coffee, Iced cafe au lait, although we asked for an extra shot of espresso, it arrived extra milky and the espresso flavor was muted. We let our server know and he kindly replaced our drink with a re-make. We both felt it was still on the light end, but we appreciated the effort. Flavor rating: 2/5  These sweet treats spoke to me:   The Praline chocolate affogato -Vanilla parfait, chocolate ice cream, praline tartufo, illy espresso $12 - The portion size is extremely tiny, served in a highball glass barely enough to share; and trust me you wont want to share this divine creation. The espresso is dramatically poured onto the ice-ceam ball table-side. If you have never had the pleasure to try an affogato, this is one of my favorite ways to enjoy sweet and bitter together in perfect harmony. The espresso is dark with a nice kick, plus the sweetness of the praline and creaminess of the vanilla ice-cream pair together magically. I just wish the portion size was not a tease. Flavor rating: 4/5  Peach almond pana cotta White peach jelly, fresh raspberries, almond cookie tuile $12 - Also a tiny portion served in a highball glass, you might reconsider sharing this as well. This is an extremely light palate cleanser and leaning more towards refreshing versus a sweet tooth remedy. After letting the smooth pana cotta and white peach jelly melt on your tongue for a while, you are invigorated by the tart fresh raspberries and delighted by the deliciously crisp almond cookie tuile. This delicate dessert is also a great end to the evening, but remember, it is super light and may not be a substantial craving destroyer. Flavor rating: 3/5  I would say based on our late night dessert experience, the ambiance and scene would reward a return trip back to try their cuisine on one of these witching hours.",

We put our names in and waited 15 minutes to get seated, but once we were seated, there were tons of open seating. I didn't get it.   They offered \"breakfast\" menu which had a burger on it, I didn't understand why, but sure. I got the burger (I ordered room service the night before and got a burger, maybe it was from the same place!) So I got it again, the buns were really greasy, I didn't even want to hold it. Cheese on my burger was an additional $2  We were seated next to a couple who, the girl wanted to sit in the back but it was closed, so she argued with the waiter that they needed to sit back there. Sort of making a scene because she kept saying \"literally!?!?\" and then sat down next to us. The guy went to sit next to her and they were groping one another in front of us, really made my late-night dinner experience with my girlfriends and husband uncomfortable. Now we can see why she needed to be in the back room.   Though, there was another couple sitting on the other side of our table and it was worse, they ordered pizza and were feeding one another pizza while the girl had her legs opened and the guy was touching her...down there.   Needless to say, we didn't have a great dining experience here and we stayed longer than they did! My husband got the pizza, which seemed to be the choice here, I should have went with that. My girlfriend got caesar salad and it looked really sad. My other girlfriend got the gnocchis and said it was very heavy and too creamy.   Our bill came to $100 and it wasn't even worth it.   Our waiter took quite a bit of time to give us our check or even check on us, so overall, I wasn't impressed.",

The soup is amazing -I have never had a better minestrone soup. I usually have the salmon or chicken  -but all the dishes look very good.  I love that the food isn't not too heavy, and they will accommodate.. yes - whenever I have had a special request they tried their best to make it happen. They really do put in the effort and I appreciate that. They even learned my name and began to use that instead of some overly-formal annoying form of address. Last time, they called me \"Bella\" and that was great too. I will return next time I'm in Vegas.",

Allegro certainly ranks up there.  Friendly, fun and elegant. Classy service, great food (with rather large portions) and fantastic management. Bravo!",

First and foremost the pricing definitely shouldn't be considered Casual Dining...then again it's the Wynn so..  Compared to the other fancy restaurants within the hotel this place doesn't look like much, in fact you wouldn't be wrong to assume it's another restaurant amongst the casino. However rest assure that the food is goooooood.  Our server was great and gave some superb recommendation. I'm a diehard calamari fan so it's a must try everywhere I go and this have it pretty good here.  The Bruschetta is a must try. Definitely very unique compared to the regular garlicky tomatoes that you're used too. The figs add a great flavor too.  We shared mains and we had the seafood linguine(was originally risotto in the menu but we changed it to linguine), lobster mac & cheese and pork chop. Wouldn't change a thing and loved every bit of it!   I'll let pictures do the talking.",

The Hispanic gentleman was helpful and actually cared- everyone else seemed to just be there and not enjoy what they were doing or care if you enjoyed it either.   Was pretty excited to try Allegro after how delicious Stratta was, which is the Italian restaurant that formerly held the space. A complete downgrade. Pepperoni pizza was decent, definitely not worth ordering. My friends got the Margherita pizza which they said was ok just because they were starving.   I asked my server to recommend an appetizer and he recommended the bruschetta- comes with 3 pieces and has prosciutto on top. I love prosciutto, but this dish was just ok. I had half of one and we left the other 2 1/2 pieces, but they never inquired as to why we barely touched it. I understand it's a casual dining restaurant and open until 5 am so I get its not going to have a huge culinary and 5 star service focus, but I still expected quality from the Wynn.   The friends I was with said that the cafe was much better, so if I ever happen to be in the area late at night, I guess I'll be trying that.",

I would have likely enjoyed it even more if I had more time to eat it at a normal pace. The pizza was a decent price for Las Vegas.  At some point I will have to come by and try real meal at a table so I can give a more helpful review.",

We had a hard time getting the attention while waiting for the pizza in twilight zone.  As we looked around, people at the other two tables were doing the same thing!  No one was getting their food, or service. Some time later our new waitress came with apologetic gesture, and complimentary dessert to make up for the \"inconvenience.\"  But that was too late.

The ambiance of this place is awesome and the service that we received both nights was impeccable. The first night I just went with the standard lasagna dish and it was spot on. Very delicious and filling. The second night I got the Ravioli dish and while very good, it wasn't that filling.  Everyone in my party ordered a variety of food from steaks to pasta to soups and salads. Everything was delicious. There was not one single dish that wasn't fully enjoyed.

She not only gave us a great recommendation (Allegro), she went out of her way, called the manager and made sure there was availability, walked us to the restaurant, AND make sure we got a reservation right away!

In fact, the food at the Wynn Tableau restaurant has been a favorite of ours and we even wrote a letter to Mr. Wynn letting him know how great the food was.  I am not a picky eater but we were VERY disappointed in the food at this restaurant.  We dined here on a Sunday night in mid-December so maybe that was the problem? but the food was really below par.  The only reason we chose the restaurant was because the concierge highly recommended it.  We have eaten at other restaurants in this hotel such as Wazuzu and Tableau and others--all have been very good.  First I ordered Linguini with clams.  I asked for a white sauce and the sauce was watery and thin---it is supposed to be a clear olive oil sauce--but not thin and tasteless.  I NEVER send back my meals but this was inedible.  I wanted something in the same category so I asked for Scampi--again--way below what you would get in a nice Italian restaurant.  My husband ordered pasta with marinara sauce and it was just \"ok\".  We weren't expecting the best Italian food in the world, but this was below the quality of a chain Italian restaurant with prices that match the very finest.  The service was excellent and the water felt badly.  The restaurant was half empty--we were very disappointed.",

If my table is over crowded with dishes and I have to stack them up and then ask you to remove them from the table then there's something wrong with the service.   Now for the food, the salmon was cooked medium (the way it should be) but it lacked flavor. It was lackluster. If I'm paying $36 for a plate it better be perfect in every aspect where I shouldn't ask for salt or pepper to make it tastier.   Margarita pizza was delicious and so was the arugula salad.",

After being seated and ordering drinks the restaurant manager Joel began insisting we order more food even though we all had ordered drinks. A few of us had already eaten at the Wynn's buffet and really couldn't eat more at the moment but wanted to stay with our group until everyone ate dinner. Rather than hear us out and let us eat the food we ordered, they took the food from the table and insisted we move to the bar.   While I understand the desire to sell more food, Allegro should take into account it is a hotel restaurant and at least try to accommodate hotel guests.",

What we got: Beef carpaccio: okay, Butternut squash soup with crab: okay Bianca pizza: this was pretty good, the only thing.  Calamari: not good considering level of quality we were expecting, rubbery. The spicy sauce was spaghetti sauce with red pepper flakes.   Frisee salad: way too expensive for what it is, we didn't eat it  Baked clams: my bf chipped his filling because there were some hard little pieces in 2 of the clams.   I wish it was better. Maybe we didn't order the right things, just wanted to try a bunch of dishes. Service was great but can't give it higher than a 3 for a place we wouldn't return to unless it was for pizza after a club night.   The pizza was very good.",

We needed a restaurant to accommodate a group of five on a Saturday night at 9 PM stat. Luckily, we turned a corner and stumbled right into Allegro. It's an Italian - American fusion restaurant. So, say no more. 80% of my group of friends are Italian so boom. We win. We were feeling adventurous so instead of each getting a dish, we all shared a bunch of plates. We had wine, pilsners, Caesar salad, baked lasagna, gnocchi, and two pizzas. The meatball pizza is fantastic as well as a pepperoni. Could we be more Italian? It was amazing. The environment was great and our server was outstanding. He even over heard us talking about how we wanted to go to a club and so he got us on the list somewhere. It was really kind of him. The whole experience was great. Some of my favorite restaurants are at the Wynn and now I can just add Allegro to the list :-)",

The food was perfect. Great quality.   We has salads- the arugula with a citrus dressing (lightly dressed the way salad was intended to be!) and the farro salad (a bit sweet for me but my husband liked it). We also got the prosciutto platter and the beef carpaccio. We asked for all of it to come out at once and they were great about that. All of the food was spot on.   The reason I have to drop it a star is because of the service. Our waiter seemed to be stretched rather thin and wasn't around much. We had better luck with the bus boy. Also, my husband ordered one of the drink specials and apparently they were out of one of the minor ingredients. My husband asked if they could substitute something for that ingredient or just make it without it and the waiter told him \"no... sorry\"??? Strange response we thought....",

    "text": "All things considered, I am rating Allegro at 3 stars. While the service was excellent and I enjoyed my food, I thought the ambiance was lacking. While I can appreciate that Allegro is considered casual dining, nevertheless, I expected a classier environment.    My husband and I dined here on a Saturday evening around 6 pm. We had reservations, not sure if they are required or not. I was not thrilled when we were seated in the lounge area, directly next to the bar. There was a party of 6 sharing 2 stools at the bar who were obnoxiously loud. There was a table with 6 people seated behind us that seemed unreasonably close for a restaurant of this caliber. If you are dining at Allegro with the intention of having a romantic Italian meal with your sweetheart,  you may want to request being seated away from the bar.  Or dining at another place...   With that out of the way.. Adam was our server and he was fantastic. We had a minor snafu with our show tickets that my husband was trying to rectify while I was seated, Adam got his manager involved to assist.   For our meals, my husband and I started out by sharing the minestrone soup. He had the potato gnocchi as his entree, and I went with one of the specials; a mushroom risotto with shrimp, which was served in a pumpkin. The chef at Allegro uses pesto in the minestrone, which I love but I don't think my husband cared really cared for. My risotto had tons of tasty, wild mushrooms and 3 large, delicious shrimp. Neither of us drank any liquor, which kept our final bill fairly reasonable, considering we were on the Strip.  With it's proximity to the Le Reve theater, reasonable on-strip pricing and late hours,  I can see why Allegro stays as busy as it does. I can see myself returning, however I will know better than to expect any kind of romantic ambiance when I do.",

Lasagna: we never order lasagna but hubs had a weird craving. It was ok. It was a giant portion but sauce didn't taste homemade and didn't have any spices or anything, so just kinda nothing special. I think a homemade ragu with lots of fresh spices like basil, oregano, thyme mixed with a nice meat would really improve the dish, and also a higher quality of mozzarella.  Wines: wish they had more napa/Cali wines that were more familiar. We order both cabs- wasn't super excited about either one. Wish they had the justin cab, hall cab, or duckhorn merlot. Just a thought  We had no service issues but we did eat dinner at midnight so maybe it was a slower time. Our waiter was nice and attentive.",

The caesar salad was also very good, with not too much dressing. The pizzas are big (14\"), so share yours with someone else. I ordered a margherita pizza, and it was decent. It wasn't too flavorful or original, but it was okay.  The restaurant is located right by the casino, so it can get louder during the later hours. The feel of the restaurant itself, however, is very cozy and warm. The decor is not anything stellar, but it still provides for a nice overall experience. Our service was great, with attentive and helpful waiters. It's also a good restaurant to eat at if you're seeing a show at the Wynn, because it's within eyesight of the theater.",

    "text": "AWFUL!!!  My girl friend and I went here last night around 4am hoping for a nice, quiet dinner.  Right off the bat we were treated with disrespect from the hostess who apparently doesn't enjoy single females in her restaurant.  The place had maybe 3 tables of people and 3 people at the bar total.  After sitting, the service was slow and inattentive.  My friend tried to order a drink only to be told that the bar was probably closed but they would check on it.  They never did so she ended up ordering her own 10 minutes later.  Our food was DISGUSTING.  The salad tasted bitter and awful.  My friend liked the soup but I didn't..  the pasta was just meh.    Some extremely drunk hotel guests sat at the table right next to us and slid their table into ours for an attempt at a 4am hookup but we tried to be nice to them.  One of them ended up getting really rude so we had to tell them to get the hell away from us.  They caused a small scene and were kicked out by security.  I do applaud our waiter for helping us out.    While the guys were next to our table he took a sip out of my water.  I obviously wouldn't want the water after that so I told the waiter and he took it.  I ended up with no water for maybe 20 minutes until I tracked down someone else and he got me one.  We asked for ice water and never got that either.  ugh.  So, not even 5 minutes after these two guys get kicked out from the place, the hostess sits two more drunk guys at that same table.  Not even 30 seconds after sitting down the guys are asking us 1,000 questions and being loud and annoying.  The people that worked there were laughing.. I was too because I had given up on having a nice dinner at this point.  We weren't asked if we would like anything else before receiving the bill but my friend wanted more drinks so they had to go back and redo it.  Then, part of our bill was put onto the neighboring table's tab so we had to talk to those annoying guys even more  He took both of our bills back and then ours came back with one of THEIR items on it.  It finally got fixed and we tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.  There's not much selection on the menu either.  :/",

At first we were on a waiting list for 2 people for 20 minutes and we sat at the bar ordered a drink and finally we gave up they never came and got us when we told them we were going to the bar. Good thing the bartender was extremely nice and you could tell she enjoyed her job. We ordered the ravioli as an appetizer and we both ordered two different pastas and they were actually good. I wasn't a fan of the bread basket but I really did enjoy the pastas. Overall, I did like this place especially if you don't want to spend too much.

    "text": "There are several things you should know about this restaurant.  First, there's a daily happy hour with a limited, lower priced menu and beer/wine selections.  The bar gets very crowded during the happy hour period when the hotel is busy.  In fact, it's not uncommon to see people sitting at the bar area, which is open from the casino floor, starting around 2:30PM while the restaurant is closed just to ensure that they can get a seat.  The happy hour guests typically extend their stay at the bar beyond 5PM and well into the dinner period.  If your intension is to sit at the bar around 3PM, you should scope it out around 2:30PM to ensure that it's not one of those crowded days when you won't be unable to get a bar stool for most of the night.  You should definitely make dinner reservations to ensure a seat if you know you'll want to eat there.  Now, the food is really why I'm writing this.  Some of the dishes have changed over the years, and not always for the better.  For example, the Ribeye steak used to come with perfectly roasted potatoes and mushrooms.  It was a perfect dish.  I was there in May 2015 and had it twice, but this time they offered it only with roasted rutabaga, which is a root vegetable that eats like a cross between a turnip and a chayote.  Not a great choice on their part.  The steak is perfect and nothing goes better with a steak than potatoes and mushrooms.  They had it right before.   The other dishes are all pretty good.  The pizzas are unbelievably thin and crispy with terrific toppings.  The veal parmesan is a show-stopper.  It's a pounded, bone-in veal chop that's about 12\" across, breaded, and covered with great marinara and fresh mozzarella--don't order it unless you're very hungry.  The beer, wine, and cocktail offerings are first-rate.  Great place, if you can get a seat.",

    "text": "You can have two experiences at Allegro: 1. A very respectable Italian dinner in the  fine surrounds of Wynn. 2. A 3am, just rolled outta the club starving and need to sober up meal. For this flexibility, I have the utmost respect for Allegro. And if you must know, I had experience #2.   So, I can't comment on your average dinner date at Allegro, but I can tell you that at 3am in the morning, if you snag a ringside seat, you can enjoy an upscale breakfast with some primo people watching and endless entertainment. Their late night menu (available from 10:30pm-6am) features 3 breakfast selections, including a lobster omelet, alongside Italian fare. This is simply brilliant because everyone wants breakfast when they're stumbling out of the club. I will say that the three eggs scrambled soft we ordered didn't come out soft. They came out as an egg brick, which I despise, but I was having a good time, so it was a minor concern. I also sampled a meatball from a fellow diner's plate, and it was one delectable ball.   But, the real beauty of this experience for me was that it was at 3am, in a beautiful surrounding, and we were seated in a table that abutted the main Wynn walkway, so in our tipsy state, we were able to have a lively interaction with passerbys, or as they came to be known this evening \"drive by hollerin's.\"   If it's 3am and you're at either Wynn or Encore in desperate need of sustenance and don't want your night to end, Allegro is just what the nightlife doctor ordered.",

We were seated promptly, given water and bread, the  left unattended for about 10 minutes. The waiter arrived, took our order, which included a couple appetizers and returned about 15 minutes later with our appetizers. Approximately 40 minutes after our initial order was taken, we still did not have our dinner and our waiter had not checked on us. No more bread was delivered to the table and our waters were not refilled. The restaurant was not overly busy. We managed to flag down a bus boy and asked for our waiter. Our waiter came about 5 minutes later and said the manager would be over shortly. Another 5 minutes later, the manager arrived, apologized and said our order was net to be delivered. Another 5-8 minutes later our food arrived. It was well after 11pm when we were w served our food. Two of my friend orders the veal Marsala which was severely over salted. Myself and another friend ordered shrimp carbonara, and the shrimp was over-cooked and lacked any flavor at all. The manager brought 2 complimentary, small desserts which seemed to be the least popular on the menu. For $250, (no drinks), we expected much more.",

The service of allegro was really good but doesn't match all my expectations but the guy that served was beyond nice and very helpful. I ordered: penne with tomato sauce and cheese. This was different to other Italian dishes I ate in other restaurants because the over baked the cheese which made the penne very crunchy but again not the best I have eaten. Over all I really recommend people to go here!   Review by: Noah Adams",

When I can't find something thrilling on the menu at an Italian restaurant, I'll often opt for the spaghetti with meatballs. It's a classic dish that, if they can't get right, bodes unwell for anything else. Fortunately, the noodles were cooked al dente and the meatballs moist. Unfortunately, we started with a selection of cured meat and flatbread pizza so I was stuffed by the time my entree arrived :(  Came back later after a night of drinking, though, to have some extremely satisfying post-drinking pizza. But so did everyone else.",

Seeing as how the Allegro was right under me, and it was reservations only, I was expecting some fancy ass food.   Between four people, we shared a margherita pizza (which was totes boring), fried calamari (best part of the meal), a pasta dish each (I got the cannelloni, which is basically just spaghetti with pork baked in a mound of melted cheese) and a glass of wine (the other best part of the meal).  So basically, a pretty meh meal at a pretty meh location (no good views, right by the roulettes, loud peeps erywhere) for a pretty not meh price (I believe it came out to be like $70/person).",

    "text": "Stratta/Allegro same thing. They have two Yelp pages so I'll just copy and paste what I wrote on the other one here:  I am completely disappointed in this restaurant. I used to come here with my family whenever we came to Las Vegas because we enjoyed their service, food, and ambience. We came to Vegas during Thanksgiving and made reservations to come here for Thanksgiving dinner. When we showed up we realized that it was empty- that should've been a sign.   When we made the reservation we mentioned that we had a baby in a stroller so they could accommodate us accordingly. We get there and the hostess was going to seat us in the corner by the casino and have us put the stroller outside on the casino carpet! Thankfully, our server rushed over and had us sit in a corner which had more room for a stroller (and just made more sense).   We ordered one of their pizzas as an appetizer because bottom line is, they have damn good pizza. The pizza sauce they use is amazing. When placing our orders our server let us know that they might be out of turkey dinner but might have one left. It was only 6:30 so I was shocked but my thought process was \"MIGHT have one left....MIGHT not be fresh\" so I decided to get a steak instead. We all ordered different types of steaks and shared some side dishes such as the sauteed mushrooms and potatoes au gratin.   The potatoes were not cooked and were super thick chunks. Our server apologized and brought us out another batch. Yet again, not cooked thoroughly. I mean, you expect them how to properly cook what they advertise at their specialty sides. My steak was cold, as if it was sitting out there for an hour. Our server was kind enough to reheat it but once it came out, it just didn't taste right. I've had many steaks in my life, really good high quality ones but this was not worth it at all. I can get over the fact that with the price it doesn't come with any sides. But don't serve me a slap of bland meat for your jacked up prices. And learn how to make potato au gratin please. If it's on your menu you should know how you prepare it correctly.",

The service is not good for a higher end restaurant, it took 10 minutes to get water, 20 minutes to order. We asked for bread and it came out at the same time as our meal.  We customized a vegan pizza from the mushroom one on the menu, which was encouraged. It was mediocre at best and cold. When asked if liked it, I said it was ok and would not order it again. Our server proceeds to say well its best the way it is put on the menu with regular cheese. If I ate regular chees do you think I would have ordered soy cheese?? Think before you make ridiculous comments.   On another note, very upset that this restaurant serves two veal (baby cow) dishes. Get with the times and quit serving babies.  I would not recommend this place due to price, poor service, mediocre food, and not caring about animal welfare.",

Appetizers included a very good Caesar salad, excellent meatballs in tomato sauce, fried calamari (which my husband loved) and an exceptional prosciutto-arugula-Parmesan pizza with uber thin crust cooked in the wood burning oven - it was fantastic. Two entrees included a tender filet with eggplant Parmesan and a seafood risotto. All cooked very well and very tasty. To finish, a super creamy tiramisu, which was delicious, and a cherry-cake-cream concoction also quite good. As an added bonus, is located just steps from the Wynn theaters. Our server Amanda was wonderful- friendly, warm and welcoming who knew the menu well and offered good suggestions. All in all, great food and a really pleasant dining experience, and would definitively recommend (and family friendly).",
