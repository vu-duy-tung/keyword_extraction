Everything I have ordered so far has been blah. Nothing memorable and delicious for me to want to come back.. and what's up with the tuna poke here??? Everytime I've asked for it, it was either sold out or not available. I gave up and stopped asking for it after the 5th time lol.   overall, I've had better hawaiian food but I'll continue to order diff items but not really expecting much from this place",

I would so pay extra to add that my bento box, loco mock, or breakfast i-log dish.   That's my only complaint about this place. Hopefully they'll heed my advice and add it as an option to their menu.",

The pork in it is always so moist and there's lots of taro leaves to eat. This is the only place in town I'll get my Lau Lau from, other places are too dry.  Just recently I the adobo omelet and MAN! So good!  The customer service is excellent and they're always really friendly.  I love this place and will continue to go back again and again.",

My friend is from Hawaii originally and has had macaroni salad many different ways. She was curious so asked as she did not want to regret a double order of a style of mac salad she may not like...you catch my drift.  The clerk replied that she had no clue, however she added she \"thinks\" it may have chopped cucumber in it? She also stated she had never tasted it before. Ok so being the type we are, we go for it, and wield the consequences later...so double order of the \"Mystery\" mac salad it is.  It was a bit bland, not made with best foods, most likely store brand mayo. Not sweet, not very flavorful, however if mixed in with every other item on your plate, it does the trick.  We ordered the the Pork Lau-lau, served with Rice and Macaroni Salad. This dish was good, the lau-lau was a great presentation, very tender, juicy and tasty. It was a nice portion indeed. The sticky rice was good as well.  I also ordered a side of lumpia shanghai w/sweet chile sauce the way I like it. Mmmmmm yummy.  I make chicken lumpia at home, I will come here for my pork lumpia!  All in all was an ok meal, some goodness balanced with some blandness rates this review with a 3 Star.  Suggestion is have your employees know the food, questions about their menu is something they should be prepared for. Just saying...",

    "text": "My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  Kalbi - These were just ok.  The marinade was nothing special... pretty much what I expected which was overly sweet with not much of a complexity of flavoring agents.  The meat itself was probably the thinnest cut of short ribs I have ever seen.  Even L&L serves up a thicker slab.  Katsu - This was actually pretty good.  Tender and juicy interior with a super crispy and light exterior.  Unfortunately I was not diggin' the dipping sauce.. it just tasted like hoisin mixed with oyster sauce.  Chicken Teriyaki - The teriyaki sauce is horrible.  It was thickened with so much cornstarch that it didn't have much flavor.    Adobo Omelette -  Don't know what everyone is raving about.  Imagine leftover adobo that mom made from the night before, which was fried with some leftover rice the next morning, then wrapped in a blanket of the flattest scrambled eggs I have ever sunken my teeth into.  I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely has that \"homemade\" and \"comfort food\" spot we all have, but please do not go out of your way just to make this purchase.  Mac Salad - Typical island mac.. peppery, sweet, & mayo-y.  Rice - Super sticky to the point where the rice balls on my plate were a congealed mass of mush.  Spam Musubi - Well, you can't mess up spam, but you can mess up the complimenting sauce and well, the sauce that was slathered between the spam and the rice did the spam musubi no justice.  OVERALL:  Not worth another penny from my wallet.  Maybe it would've been better if it were drunk food.  Also, the people that work here weren't very friendly.  Not one person had a smile on their face.  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!",

I do despise the price of the musubi, at $2.50 a pop it's kind of ridiculous! Other than that the staff is always friendly and inviting. Food is prepared fast, but be weary of coming late at night. For some reason during night hours the rice seems like it's been sitting forever and is all mushy and disgusting. Great place for lunch and right down the street from my work!",

    "text": "Continuing on the search to find a fabulous serving of pork lau lau, I was brought to Aloha Kitchen on S. Decatur Blvd.  Pulling into the lot, I recall seeing this place on yelp and was anxious to get my turn at it.  It's pretty crowded for a late Friday night and people are starting to pile in.  We join the line and perused the menu above.  The BF convinces me to go for the Hawaiian Plate at $8.99.  It's Kalua Pig and Pork Lau Lau, so this way he gets to try some of the kalua pig too!  This comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad.  The BF ops for the Kalbi Combo at $7.99.  This give us Kalbi, Katsu, and Chicken Teriyaki.  It also comes with the standard two scoops of white rice and one scoop of mac salad.    I should mention, I've been to my share of Hawaiian joints, but my sister takes the cake.  She definitely makes it a point to try out any new ones that she comes across.  She also always substitutes the two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad for an additional scoop of mac and one less rice.  This is usually never a problem, and if anything, they might charge a bit more for the mac salad.  Well, I asked if I could do this.  The cashier had to ask another woman, and she in turn had to ask another guy (the manager/owner) I assume.  He flat out said no.  Wow.  They tried explaining something about not charging me for the rice, so they can't do that.  Anyway, I think I was just put off with the whole \"No.\" answer.  They could have said yes and said they would charge me for the substitution, which I probably would have agreed to anyway.    We got our number, helped ourselves to beverages and condiments and took a seat in a booth.  One of the servers soon headed our way with my order.  Just as she was about to place it on the table, all this liquid came spilling out onto the floor and table from the plate.  (Wtf?)  She apologized and went to retrieve a towel to clean up the mess.  I was fine with the spill and clean up, my concern was with where all the liquid came from?!  I guess my Pork Lau Lau must have come out a bath, because that was dripping wet.  I ended up  pouring all this additional liquid off my plate into another plate before my rice and mac salad got too soggy from all this 'juice' sitting on my dish.  I unraveled my lau lau in search of my pork and took my first bite.  For being soggy, the meat was rather tough and the whole dish had no taste.  I ended up pouring tons of shoyu all over the dish.  There was no fatty bits either to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing on the pork lau lau part.  The kalua pig faired a bit better, but not by much.  It started out well, but as I got deeper into it, there was a lot of tough pieces that I ended up spitting out.  Overall, my dish was pretty disappointing.  I wouldn't go back here for any pork lau lau at all.  I was about halfway through my order before the BF's order finally arrived.  (This is never a good thing.)  His was better, in his opinion.  He had a decent experience with his order at least.  The Chicken Teriyaki had a sweeter sauce than what I'm used to, but that's probably why this dish does well here.   The mac salad was better than some of the other places I've been to, so that was a good thing.    There's the Aloha Bar next door and there's karaoke on Friday nights.  You'll see the servers bringing orders in next door if you're dining in.    They do offer delivery, it's a $10 minimum and if you get their flyer, you'll find a 15% coupon on there. I asked if they had any business cards, which they were out of.  When the cashier asked the manager/owner if he had any, he asked \"Why?\"  (Uh, 'cuz I'm going to yelp this place, that's why!)  When it comes down to it, Aloha Kitchen will continue to do well.  They are open later than some of the other Hawaiian establishments around town (5 am on Fridays and Saturdays I believe!) and they have a surplus of young customers coming in to chow down.  They have two other locations, one on E. Charleston and the other on S. Maryland Parkway.  I just know that if I return, I won't be getting any pork lau lau, that's for sure.",

    "text": "Since multiple concurrent projects and Life In General have kept me up a lot more than my normal Xtr33m Vampiric Evil schedule necessitates, Aloha Kitchen has been my lifesaver when the Triscuits and Dack Janiels in my desk threaten to detach my fingernail grip on sanity. I've discovered that one can play \"Adobo Omelet\" drinking games, i.e. if you consume a bay leaf, take a shot! The styrofoam box it comes in is also ludicrously heavy that I can't help but giggle uncontrollably in hentai-schoolgirl bursts when I swear I can't take another bite, oh no the smell itself is making me nauseous, how the hell can someone eat this much in one sitting......then pop the fridge open after 2 hours and praise God that it's still there! Make sure to keep the rice cooker on standby when you get the Loco Moco; their particular blend is beaucoup SAUCY!  And will necessitate additional rice to quell the sometimes-salty sensations. Local Plate last night got a lot of seaweed musubi wrap in my teeth; perfect for the post-second-date makeout session.   Student specials (sub-$5), Tapsilog in the morning, and consistent Chicken Katsu give me many reasons to list the Kitchen among the daily expenditures. Now if only I could complain about \"it's too umame, could you cut back on the umame?\" with a straight face, then I know I've won at life.",

For those who don't know adobo, it's a Filipino dish that's main ingredients are soy sauce, vinegar, and onions, complimented by chicken or pork.  Not spicy, but really flavorful.  They have other Hawaiian dishes like loco moco, mac salad, kalbi, etc., too.  Bring your appetite.  This thing is about the size of a Chipotle burrito.  It is soooo delicious a friend came along after breakfast at the Bellagio buffet and still managed to finish it.",

You brought me in with the price, you kept me with the taste. I love a good chicken teriyaki bowl and Aloha has it. Everything is always hot and the chicken has a good flavor, and I personally think the hot sauce on the table adds just the right amount of flavor for anyone. Don't worry Aloha, I will be back.",

A thick chewy wrap of seaweed around a thin piece of spam and rice. Had some sort of sweet sauce in their as well.  Not a good spin on musubi.   Mac salad...now this was almost good, but wasn't  ..really the Mac salad makes the meal in my opinion.   Lau Lau ...where to begin..well I'm no expert, I don't believe a giant pile of leaves and green mush (see pic) over a tiny bit of the inside stuff is the way to do it.   Perhaps they make something worth eating, this wasn't   To top it off when my meal came I asked for Siracha and it never came. .....

I have to say though, that I have yet to find a Hawaiian joint that taste like over there. I blame my family in Hawaii for their wonderful cooking and for bringing me to the best places ever when I visit.   The spam musubi was okay, not great and not bad, just okay. I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette. It was huge! I ate maybe half of it and I have a big appetite. It was good, however the meat was a little dry.   Service was great and I definitely would come back to try the other entrees.",

Ok the pancakes would've been delicious if two of the three weren't burnt. This was an order pickup so I didn't know until I got home and began eating them, very disappointed. The macadamia nut sauce is truly the star though. They actually ran out of macadamia nuts so that was already missing from the dish, didn't make a fuss about it. But these are pancakes and you know when they are burnt so they tucked the burnt ones under the one that wasn't. Would it had really been that hard to make two more, they don't take long to make and it wasn't that crowded. The Fried Rice Lovers Omelette was plentiful but super dry and bland, will never order it again. Extremely disappointed in my visit today!!!",

We left and decided to come back another time.   I was in the area today and stopped by around 10:45 in the morning. There were 5 people ahead of my in line, but it wasn't crazy busy like the last time. I ordered the Local Plate to go. It came with teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef and 2 spam musubis. The chicken had a lot of fat on it, there was barely any meat at all. The beef was tender and flavorful. I also like how they are not stingy with their spam musubis. Thick slices of spam and they did not over do it with the rice. Other places will put a very thin slice of spam on a huge block of rice, which is always disappointing. The portions of chicken and beef were small, but the 2 spam musubis definitely made up for that!  The cashier wasn't too friendly, but she wasn't rude either. I thought for sure that I would have to wait a while for my food, but it actually came out pretty quickly. Next time, I want to try the kalua pork and lau lau plate. Hopefully, it will be better than the one at L&L.",

But Aloha Kitchen also has a bar.  All the more fun... there's karaoke.  Overall it's a cool place to hangout and support the daring ones who belt out their voices in front of strangers.  We heard some great voices too; like competition material ;)  Service always has the aloha spirit each time we've been here.  They work late and they're still super nice.  Our food was even brought over to the bar section.  Note that in the bar area there is a two drink minimum to kick it there.    Comfy food, cool hangout, offers casual dining section and karaoke bar, serves liquor, and super friendly service. Who said you can't find the island in the desert?",

Just plain disgusting. On top of ordering with rice on the side, they decided to separate every aspect of it . Wouldn't come back. I'll stick to ohana bbq.  Even the loco moco at Born and Raised (BAR) is 10000x better.  Maybe I just got weeks old left over I don't know. But I was offered a refund after having to drive all the way back to return the food.  Just a waste really",

They can replay the recorded videos all they want, and they will find out we werent harrassing her or anything like that. Im here at the parking lot doing this review.

The DJ's are so corrupt, they play all kinds of games with the customers (making you sound like crap for racial or personal reasons). When I tried to let the manager (bald-headed brainless guy who's apparently only has a job because he's related to the owner), he was unbelievably obnoxious. I guess he sticks-up for his incompetent DJ because he has the hots for her -- always trying to flirt with her, etc). Unprofessionalism and racism all-around. What's the deal with these Filipino karaoke bars? Seems they're all as corrupt as can be.  Don't support this business. It's corrupt. Especially the owner, Liza.",

You can get a fountain drink or opt for Hawaiian Sun. I'm all about Hawaiian Sun passion fruit. Ok so I always get the combo plate teriyaki. It comes with chicken, beef and pork smothered in teriyaki yummy sauce with two scoots of rice and one scoop of the best macaroni salad!!! It's a huge plate but if you are like me it's one of those plates that you keep eating because it tastes soooo freaking good!!!   You order and sit down they bring the food out to you on real plates with real silverware and some napkins. I love that they are open until 4am! Maybe because they have a karaoke bar next door.

I thought it was decent because my preference is to have it a little drier/crispier rather than a lot of sauce - though it was tasty. The BBQ plate my friend ordered looked pretty good too!  I would recommend this place because Im sure there are some delicious winners on the menu - I just didnt hit it on my first visit. Again, lots of local choices on the menu, very impressed!   Finally, this must be a good place because there was a small wedding dinner reception in the main dining area while we were there! Awesome and congrats!",

Service has always been excellent, coming from the many faces I see come and go behind that counter, with the employees pretty much knowing my order as soon as I walk in. They also would deliver promptly whenever I would order for delivery. I've tried nearly everything on the menu, but the dish I ALWAYS order is the Local Plate. Which could very well be their signature dish since it's one of the most common items ordered from the menu.   Everything from the macaroni salad, to the spam musubi is top notch...whenever it's cooked properly. You see, Over the past 8 or so years I've been coming here, the food has mostly been superb. But it's not very consistent. There have been quiet a few times where the Rice is either soggy or hard. Or the beef is too dry. It's a shame since whenever they do it right, it's FANTASTIC. But the few times they get it wrong, it's downright horrid. I can understand that not every single meal can be cooked perfectly, but the slip ups happen a bit too often.   They do a good job of keeping the place clean too. It's visually appealing as well. There hasn't been a time where I was disgusted with the interior or even exterior of the restaurant. They also have a karaoke bar connected to the dining area, which is separated by its own set of doors.  This place will always be one of my favorite restaurants. Especially since the service is always excellent and the place is clean and eye catching. Overall, it's a great place to eat with good vibes all around. Just hope you catch the chef on a good day.",

    "text": "Man this place great choice for Hawaiian food in Las Vegas! Living in Hawaii and visiting family in Vegas, what better place to eat and talk story like Aloha Kitchen. Market Street Cafe would be another place that the locals go and eat, but Aloha Kitchen & Bar is so ono!  They place closes pretty late so you can get your late night grinds on if your up past 12am.  What I got was Local plate which includes: Combination of Teriyaki Chicken, Beef and 2 Spam Musubi. It included more rice also. I think they can cut back on the rice that isn't in the Musubi and give an extra scoop of mac salad.  The teri beef and chicken was cooked awesome. It wasn't over cooked and tough. The chicken was easy to cut and so was the teriyaki beef. The teriyaki sauce catered to the masses and more of a mainland pallet but I thought it was very delish!  THe Musibi could have been wrapped a little tighter because it was falling apart when i took a bite out of it.  Pricing was on point too. nothing crazy like paying on the strip, but for the amount of food you get, and the price you pay, its a deal!  Everyone praises the adobo fried rice but I didn't try it this time. I'll most defiantly try ti next time in in town and craving some local hawaiian food.  Over all, love this place and will be visiting it more when im back in Vegas.",

The good news is that our favorite KJ Mack was stills here doing his karaoke magic and of course having hawaiian food is always an extra bonus.  The lounge was about half full when we arrived but as the night continued on it definitely turned into an epic party house with a great vibe.  From karaoke singing, dancing, and comedy from the lounge hosts, KJ Mack & Barman Chris, this is definitely a place to come have fun.  :)",

Another 5 minutes they brought another one of our entrees (which was not correct) and our Ahi Poke appetizer.   Seriously, appetizer 23ish minutes and after other food??  After sitting for another 15 minutes, they brought out our final entree. Long after everybody else was finished eating.  We were also led to believe there was family friendly karaoke here. There is not. Karaoke is in a separate non family friendly bar area.  We will not be back to this place.",

I ordered before my guest and they got their food way before me, not only was my food late but several other customers got their food before me. The guest I brought got their food and ate their food before I even got mine.  My friends adobo fried rice omelette was made spicy and never got sides.  I finally walked up to cashier and started pointing out that other parties got their food.  They still insisted mine was next.  Then I asked about the mac salad and spam musubis they still owed us.  How hard is it to scoop mac salad?  Funny thing is they had several mac salads on counter, none were mine.  Finally after 40+ minutes my food came, ox tail ramen and spam musubis... ramen noodles were hard, couldnt eat, had 4 pieces of ox tail only 1 had a good amount of meat.  Since I was last person to get my food, my guest were done eating... so I ate the ox tail, 1 musubi and didn't take the rest of ramen home.  One of the cashiers did try to give us old toron to apologise but that wasn't even good.  Never going back to this location.

    "text": "eleven of us went to this bar at 6 p.m. we were the only patrons in the place we were waiting to sing karaoke which started at 8 p.m. after gaming for 25 minutes I finally asked the bartender if I could have a drink the chief of filled my request. A friend of mine ordered Shock Top and they were out of it another friend ordered a non-alcoholic beer and they had none. After being there in an hour a new bartender came on shift and when my friend ordered her second drink he charged her a dollar more than the first drink. So once again I've only had the one drink the whole hour I was there because there was no service so I asked the new bartender if I could have a drink he didn't even give me eye contact or make any gesture that he hear d me however he did deliver my drink but once again I had to ask for it.                                                                     Now for the Karaoke, the reason we chose to go to that place. we were told that karoke starys at 8 p.m., when the gentlemen showed up that runs the karaoke we asked him if he was the dj and his response was\"yea but Im not even on the clock yet. 8 oclock\"  he was very unenthusiastic. Once he allowed my friend to sing one song he sat down at a table and ate with a female. He was very unattentive to us. At one point my friend had to enterupt him while he engrossed in a conversation with the female that appeared to be his girlfriend. After he rolled his eyes and had poor body language we decide to leave the place and take our business elsewhere. A place where we felt welcomed and didnt feel like we were a nuisance.  Needless to say we will not be patronizing that business I'm posting it again.",

I really only like this place because it is open late (open til 3 AM) and the workers are generally pretty nice. This place does get pretty slammed, so placing an order over the phone can be pretty difficult. I usually order the Local Plate, but lately the quality has just gone down for me. The chicken katsu is hit or miss, along with the teriyaki chicken. This spot was a hidden gem for me when I first moved to Vegas 5 years ago, and it wasn't til I worked across the street I was able to recognize the walls of this place. I'll be back, hopefully things are a bit different next time.",

Those are my favorite dishes... Food are freshly made and cooked!   CON: I came to Aloha Kitchen & Bar when it was super busy. Although the staff were trying there best to take orders and push out the food in a timely manner. I requested water and waited for about 30 minutes.

Celery , carrots, ginger , and onions were swimming in this hearty oxtail soup as the meat literally fell off the bone as you work around it.  It was savory good and wayyyyyyy better than Market Street Cafe!  Like ten times better!   Aside from what brought me here, their Portuguese sausage and spam plate was also decent. We also grabbed some spam musubi to go just in case we get hangry on the road!   I'm so happy i yelped this place.  Now I know where to go to get my oxtail soup fix when in Vegas without having to inhale all that cigarette smoke going into a casino!!!  #tyyelpyoudidit!",

Now this isn't any place fancy, no fusion happening here, just good Hawaiian food with people that are there for the same reason, to grab!  There is another side to the restaurant, the bar area.  Haven't been to that side but I've always wanted to walk in to enjoy drink and the music...  It's a small place of the strip, but there are always Polynesian, Hawaiian, Somoa, etc. there and my hubby feels like he's home again.  They're never empty and there times they are absolutely full, no seats available.  Either way, he looks like he belongs there.  Food was to go this night, but the service was great and as always the ladies there make you feel like you're family as they talk and joke with you.    Come and try the macadamia pancakes or the Loco Moco.  The katsu here is pretty good too.",

I won't be coming back to this place anytime soon. & it's not the 1st time they switch up the beef...they did the same thing last year...for a hot minute & for that whole time I didn't go to Aloha, but as soon as I found out they brought back the REAL beef, I went back...but now..looks like I'm Ghosting Aloha yet again!",

There's a karaoke bar connected to it branded the same as well. We visited after 830pm and it was a quiet Friday night. The staff was really nice, calling us baby, honey, sweetheart. I'm guilty of doing the same thing.  I had the bbq chicken, my big son had chicken katsu, the small one had friend saimin, and the hubby had the garlic chicken with gravy, we shared fries and a musubi kids meal. We had some turon and poke...I'm a sucker for register add one and the turon was just staring at me as I ordered.  We chose dine-in option and were given a number for our table and sat. It's a order then seat yourself type of place. I noticed that they don't keep certain condiments not eh tables, but behind the counter instead. So if you need tobacco or sriracha, ask them! They have it for ya!  Our orders came our fairly quickly and my bbq chicken was excellent. Poke wasn't that awesome, fried saimin was okay too, but the fries for some reason were soooo good! Fries on point! I can't speak for anything else, as I murdered my bbq chicken plate and turon, so I was too full to sample anything else. Didn't visit the restroom during this occasion. I'd definitely visit again if we were ever in the immediate area. We were jumping at the trampoline place across the street before we came in this evening.",

There's a bar where they do karaoke and when that door opens you can easily have that music blasting inside the restaurant.  Horrible singers too, psssh I could be worse.  The staff is nice and friendly but the cashier or helper in the back has to be responsible also to clean up the tables so they sometimes miss a spot or two just so they can get back to the register.    But the benefactor that bumps this up to 4 stars over an average three is the flexible hours for some of us drunks tha need Hawaiian prepared food after midnight!",

The macaroni had to be tossed because I found a small white rock in it. I contacted the manager Marla and I explained the issue to her. I was given her cell phone number, so I can text her several copies of the pictures. Marla mentioned that she'll show the pictures to the kitchen. Per the assistant manager, the issue will be taken care of. Thank you all for taking care of the issue quickly.",

It was decent enough to come back each time, but if there were other spots open later, I would definitely go to other spots. I almost always order their local plate, which is beef and chicken teriyaki and 2 spam musubis, and I substitute the rice for veggies because I don't like all those carbs, and I also substitute the macaroni salad for kim chi. I have tried plenty of this other dishes as well, but my favorite thing about their menu is the kim chi, which I'm sure says a lot. It's just an average meal, hence the 3 stars.   However, the last time we did end up going here, my boyfriend had food poisoning from their curry. And now he won't ever return here, which, I guess isn't too much of a loss..",

I would not eat here again if the food was free. I wasn't asking for a refund or anything. I just wanted them to be more cognizant of what was going on.   I wouldn't recommend anybody to eat hear if you care about the way you are treated! By far one of the worst experiences ever.",

I can't believe I just paid 10 dollars and waited close to 15 minutes for a teeny tiny piece of chicken katsu on a mound of bland rice and a little bowl of curry chicken. Seriously?? You could pick birdbox style on a freaking map blindfolded and find a better choice than this. The portions of meat were about half as much as most Hawaiian BBQ places I've been to... And the little curry bowl had a giant chunk of carrot and also a giant chunk of potato taking half the volume of the container.. Are you seriously that cheap? The cashier also tried to convince me to spend about 5 dollars more than anything on the menu just to get a combination of Loco moco and chicken katsu, available at, you guessed it, literally any other Hawaiian BBQ restaurant as a standard combo. Also, the chicken was definitely crappy dark meat. Thanks for the regrets.",

    "text": "Aloha Kitchen on Decatur is a godsend if you are visiting Vegas and craving some good, cheap Hawaiian or Filipino food and can make the 5-10 minute drive off the strip (this is also a good time to make a snack/water/drink/booze run at a local grocery).  This review is all about one item which has become legendary amongst my circle of friends.  The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet.  It's a pretty simple concept: shredded chicken adobo and fried rice (that looks as if it was fired in the adobo sauce itself) are wrapped in a thin layer of scrambled egg.  The result is a burrito-sized omelet of adobo goodness!  The fried rice is always nice and moist and the chicken is just the same.  The flavors of the adobo sauce are immediately evident, the savory soy sauce, tangy vinegar and the garlic are present in every bite, with the egg adding an additional texture to contrast the rice and chicken.  Oh, and this thing is BIG.  I don't think I've ever eaten a whole omelet in one sitting.  I usually save half for later or share with a friend.  I imagine I could defeat the beast if I focused on it, but I'm usually too hungover or too concerned about the buffet that is to follow later in the day to ever attempt the feat.  If you like adobo, you need to try the adobo fried rice omelet!  For those unfamiliar with Filipino-style adobo:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAdobo%23Filipino_adobo&s=934e2626b71369bc6ea1b3ee1e789ea0d8c66fbe53e2350ce3dbb25d0a1c4ba5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad...</a>  I've also sampled the lumpia (think Filipino-style eggrolls) and the turon (dessert lumpia with banana and jackfruit) and liked them both, but our motto in Vegas has become \"eyes on the prize!\"  All we get now is the omelet.",

A few of us ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet which I tasted and thought was not really worth coming back to.  Unfortunately I will not be back.  I think the only saving grace is the price is somewhat reasonable. I do really like the Hawaiian restaurant they have at the Cal much better.",

Since Google is not a great indicator when places go belly up and my original destination was the now defunct Red Robins in the same parking area this was a \" what the hell, I'm hungry\" kind of place.  Loved it!!!  They had a little bit of everything.  I went for the teriyaki plate and some lumpia.  I could have done without the skin on the chicken but loved the lumpia.  It was so mild, and I didn't get a bit of heartburn.  If they had an Aloha Kitchen anywhere near where I lived I would have a new favorite.",

    "text": "So I've never even seen this place before until I was invited to celebrate a birthday at happy hour with friends last night.  Whenever I'm going to a new place or restaurant I depend on my fellow yelpers to direct my path.  Will it suck or not?  I must say I truly enjoyed the happy hour at Aloha Kitchen & Bar.  First of all the drinks are nice and strong and cheap (even past happy hour).  The atmosphere is comfy cozy - just what I like.  At that nice early hour of the evening we had our pick of seating.  There are comfy couches as well.  You have to go and get your drink for the most part - but who cares?  The bar tender sometimes doubled as the karaoke technician - again who cares?  When I was ready for my Patron shot - he was there to pour it.  That's all that mattered.  Everyone here was very accommodating to our mildly-wild group.  There are plenty of karaoke books and selection - even rap if you wanna get jiggy with it - and the dance floor is spacious as well.  I like the outside smoking area that is gated in a bit but you still can sit there with your drink and your smoke and not miss a beat to the party.  Now the food!  Yum!!  That's right.  Yum!!! I had the Adobe Fried Rice Omelet, my daughter had the Teriyaki combo.  They were both phenomenal.  That Adobe Fried Rice is compact and delicious and full of goodness.  Check out the pics on Yelp!  It is the perfect meal after an evening of drinking!  Protein, carbs, meats - what's not to love?  I got it to go at the end of the evening and my intent was to save it for lunch at work the next day.  That poor yummy specimen barely made it to the next light!    This is a nice chill place, very nice prices and fun atmosphere on both sides.  There is a door that separates the restaurant from the bar side.  And remember the bar is non-smoking so you have to go outside in the sitting area to do that.  You will have a good time!",

    "text": "Seriously?! I haven't done a review for this place yet? Huh, I guess not. Well its one of the better spots for Hawaiian BBQ. If getting lunch there, I'd suggest placing a take out order unless you're gonna eat there because lunch is a crazy time. Food is way better than any L&L's I've eaten at and since I can't make it down to Henderson for Ross J's or into Spring Valley for Island Flavors than this will have to do. Uncle Russ at Island Style can do only so much since he shares half the menu with Korean dishes and that spot is always popping as well. So yes I keep coming back for the quick and decent Hawaiian food most hawaiian BBQ spots can't pull off. I've tried pretty much everything and haven't really found a fault in their menu. They even serve some Filipino deserts which are good lunch time treats for me. Prices are more than reasonable, nothing over 10. I would suggest they offer a delivery service. Definitely cash in on more sales that way.",

The seating is nicely furnished and the staff is friendly and welcoming as always.  Not sure if they still hold karaoke events nightly here, but, it is definitely a popular spot for some plate lunch grinds.    As you may or may not be aware of...there is a high amount of Islanders in Las Vegas.  This translates into a high amount of Hawaiian style eateries.  In my humble opinion, Aloha Kitchen does not \"wow\" me much with their menu.  They are mediocre at best with their staples.  However, where Aloha Kitchen makes up for this, is with menu items that can't be found everywhere.    For instance, just the name of adobo friend rice instantly turns you into a rubber necker doing double takes.  It's difficult to choose anything else unless you tried it for the first time.  Not bad, but not special, although, no other place serves this to my knowledge.  I hope the avid Aloha kitchen heads don't take offense to my review, but simply put, I have had better.  Ross J's don't necessarily tickle my pickle and and L&L's doesn't quite float my boat in this respect either.  Hands down...I have to roll with Big Island Flavor with a close tie by Island Style, Rice Tracks & Ohana's.  If Hawaiian Hale still existed, they would be near the top indeed.  It's all about preference, and I tend to judge a lot on particular aspects such as mac salad and so forth.  You can bet if I get the itch for the homeland grinds, AK was still be considered.

Meanwhile, there's a fast-food beverage dispenser for your sodas, waters, and tea in the corner. The LCD displays for the menu is cool.  It's like, \"hey Anh, we like you and all but we're like a Roberto's that you get stuff yourself, but hey we'll deliver your food right to your table. Don't expect us to see you again to check on you.\" It's funny to me. It's a clean fast food restaurant, but with a \"pick up your food and GTFO or here, please sit down in these nice chairs.\" Think Teriyaki Madness but it's small-business owned.    We ordered for two Loco mocos. What better way to cure a hangover by 3PM right?  Loco moco missed the mark. Nothing to write home about. Like if I was in Vegas and you lived in San Diego as my facebook friend, I wouldn't be all, \"DUDE. You have to try out this loco moco.\" Super plain. Not very well-seasoned. As soon as my knife sliced into it, the yolk was hard (barely runny at all). I want to see that over-easy egg's guts all over my rice. I felt cheated! Hamburger patty was too tough, which made it chewy than it should be. Not quite flavorful.   I left feeling dissatisfied. Not hungry, just sad. Maybe I just wanted the rich heart-attack-inducing feel of a loco moco. The mac salad it came with was alright.  I like how clean this place is. Really nice tables and chairs. I like the separate water dispenser from the soda machine. A nice take-out place sort of feel. Prices were about right for what it was.  I don't really see what all the hype is about, but I think it deserves another chance.",

It looked like they had taken down things from their walls, many items on their menu were covered up with white paper, which I'm sorry, I think is very ghetto. Scotch taping a piece of white paper on the soda labels to show which one they are out of?! Generic white styrofoam cups? I don't know. Just looked like lots of little things, probably to cut costs.  The cashier was nice, my order came out timely, but I walked out of there thinking, \"Am I going to come back here?\"   I thought that until I opened my order. BBQ chicken I remember I loved, tender, juicy, even the rice was still hot. My son, as we speak, is inhaling the leftovers. Their portions were always generous.

    "text": "Two years later, the same concerns. I tried to order yesterday, as I was CRAVING some chicken katsu. I called, was asked if I could hold for a moment. Sure, I can wait.  I can year as the cashier takes a customer's order, then another, then another, then ANOTHER. Then, picks up the phone and hangs it up.   If they didn't want to take my order, they could have easily just said, \"We don't want your money,\" or hung up on me straight away.  Looks like I will be going to the other locations to satisfy my cravings, I'm too tired of being hung up on, being on hold long enough to drive to the location, wait in line, then give my order, or get back to work and having them forget to put in the sauce for my Chicken Katsu.  No more disappointments from Aloha Kitchen on Decatur. You all should get some customer service training, or just keep doing what you're doing & hope your customers can forgive the inability to do what restaurants are supposed to do.",

The girl who took my order had me spell my name out and took down my phone number. I placed my order with the intention of picking it up on my way in to work. She confirmed my order, told me the price, and confirmed that I was to pick it up at the Sahara/Decatur location. I got to the restaurant at 7:43. The guy at the register was busy taking another phone order, so I waited a few minutes. When he got off the phone I told him I was there to pick up my order that I had called in. He told me he didn't have any orders under my name. He even asked me if there was a different name that I might have used... What the hell!?!? I was now going to be late for work WITHOUT any food to eat for 10 hours. When I got to my car, I even called the same phone number I had called when I placed the order, and the guy at the register answered... pretty f*-d up. Get your sh*t together.",

    "text": "This is a nice little place with some good food.  I'm not a huge fan of Hawaiian food, mostly because I hate pineapple with a passion, but a friend of ours wanted to go sing karaoke, so we tried it out.  This place is a restaurant with a karaoke bar next door.  At the bar, the drinks are about $5 - $6, but I have to say they're pretty weak.  I got the feeling that you don't really go to the bar to drink, you go more to watch the karaoke singers.  I myself am too chicken to get up there and sing, but more power to the people who do!  One of the people I came with said, \"There are three types of karaoke singers: ones who are really good, ones who think they're good but are really bad, and ones who know they're bad and don't give an *ish* because they're having fun.\"  I definitely saw all three types that night.  Oh, and a guy who looked like Michael Jackson and Prince combined...he sang \"Music of the Night\"...both the Christine and Raul parts...it was amazing.  You can order food and they will bring it to you in the bar, too, which is pretty cool.  I had the garlic chicken which totally lived up to it's name and thank God had no pineapple anywhere near it, and was sooooo tender I just shredded it off with a fork.  My husband ordered the adobo fried rice and loved it.  I may be a Hawaiian food convert after coming to this place (just so long as there is no VILE FRUIT in it) and would like to experience the karaoke again.  This place is just like the 3 stars says: A-OK.",

Plus I haven't eaten hawaiian food in a real long time so I figure why not since friend already ate here before and loved it.    I like the decor.  It reminds me of Teri Cafe in San Diego.  There is plenty of parking since it's in a shopping center, which is a plus in my book.  I was surprised to see some filipino dishes on the menu but too bad we didn't get any.  This time we ordered the breakfast plate - 1 spam because I love spam and gotta have my spam and the other one was Portuguese sausage.  I'm not too big on the portuguese sausage so I thought it was alright.  But the spam plate was yummy.  It also reminded me of the mickey d's food in hawaii so that brought back some memories.  Prices are pretty decent too since coming from LA, they're a little bit cheaper than what we serve.  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area next time and craving some hawaiian food.",

However, my past two experiences with the service at this specific location have been less than mediocre at best. Today, I came in to pick up some manapua for my daughter as she has been feeling ill. When I got home they were so undercooked that they had caved in on themselves and the meat was oozing raw dough. When I called to see if they could replace it, I was placed on hold and then hung up on. I called two more times with the same result. It really is a shame. This place used to be so good.",

The food is still good ofcourse it's just amount of food that we got and the service. It wasn't the same as before. Me and my bf came in around 1am, because I just had gotten off work and I wanted to get some food before i went home.. When went in the restaurant we felt the vibe that we were not welcome.. and when the person served our food.. the guy started cleaning all the tables and making us and other people seem like intruders in the restaurant.. so me and my bf had to chow down everything in like 10 mins. The guy decide to lock the doors and it wasn't even 2 yet... I just don't understand the hours here..   If you want business.. then treat customers with priority.. Don't make them feel as if they need to hurry the eff up so you can get your asses home even if the store hours says that you should still be open anyway.. I mean i would come back but for the service.. I would rather try a different location or just stay with L&L..  better service and with good quality food.",

    "text": "The Aloha Kitchen we went to was on South Decatur Boulevard. They have another location on South Maryland Parkway that caters to the locals and UNLV students alike and I hear they have another one on Lamb Boulevard. Rumor also has it that these three locations are somehow affiliated with the Aloha Specialties store that we all know and love, located in the Cal in downtown, but that has been unconfirmed. Decorated with an almost over-the-top, stereotypical Hawaiiana theme (grass roofing, bamboo poles, brightly painted seating), the restaurant at least gave a certain sense of warmth and Hawaii feel.  But nevah mine all of that. Let's get to the food! I wasn't all too hungry myself, since I had landed not more than a few hours prior, so I ended up just going for the burger and fries combo. I wasn't expecting much because I'm not much of a burger eater to begin with. Well, to my surprise, the cooks at Aloha Kitchen did good with this one. Really good. In fact, I would even go out on the limb and say that this was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. And believe me, I'm getting up there... this life is not a short one anymore.  There was just something about this burger that made it ohhhh so tasty. The saltiness, the butteriness, the sesame-seed bunliness... YUM! If you go to Aloha Kitchen, you just gotta try this one.

Maybe they ran out of oxtail because all I got was 1 big one and 1 bony one along with shreds of oxtail. It's not even close to the first time or the ones at California Hotel. This time I mainly tasted seasoning packet that you get from a package of $.20 ramen from the supermarket. The soup was not hearty, tasty, or flavorful from the ingredients, just artificial flavoring.  If you don't have enough oxtail left then just tell me so I can get kalua pork or something instead of giving me a big bowl of noodles and mostly bone pieces.

    "text": "It's Saturday night, the night before the Big Game. Our dear friend visiting from HI is in town for her birthday.  Her other friends are also visiting from HI and want to meet up.  This other group of friends are singers and they want to go to local bar for Karaoke.  So thirteen of us pile up in three cars and make our way to this Karaoke bar.  \"Oh oh!\" I think to myself.  \"Why are there so many motorcycles?\" We park our cars and make our way to the bar. As I walk past the motorcycles, they're big bikes but they're Yamahas and Hondas and not Harleys.  So I can calm down.  We get in and meet the rest of our party from HI.  They said the time they've been here, was on a week night. They just found out that Saturday nights is biker night! OMG!  So we're trying to figure out what we're going to do. So one of the girls texts her girlfriend and says Aloha Kitchen has Karaoke on Saturday night. This workout great as one of our party members was from Oregon and she wanted Hawaiian-style food anyway.   Because we got to Aloha Kitchen a little late, all the booths for big parties were already taken. But the night of fun had already begun without us.  And I totally forgot that Aloha Kitchen's kitchen is open 24-hours. So we did it up HI style; ordered a couple of plates of fried noodles, manapuas, spam musubis, french fries, drinks and a couple of songs to sing.  4-stars for the Karaoke bar and 3.5-stars for the restaurant.",

I like to get the vegetable egg rolls to go with the student special.  The food is always consistent and cooking times varies depending on how busy they are.  Service is great they bring the food to you when it's ready so you don't have to stand around waiting.  If you're super hungry then make sure to try the mix plate and get your grub on!

Not cause there's a bar but It's actually not that far from the strip. Still not a short a drive as the other one but it almost seems like there are more options at this location on Decatur.  My friends & I were starving for some local food one late Saturday night. We were coming from Bellagio and it was near closing time for the other location so we made a beeline for Decatur because it's open much later. This restaurant is located in an outdoor shopping plaza. There was plenty of parking.  I ordered the lau lau and a side of spam musubi. Having come back from visiting Hawai'i a few months ago, I was really craving some authentic local grindz. Craving fulfilled... The pork lau-lau was good. It had good flavor. I just wish there was more of it than the serving had. I guess I really was hungry cause I scarfed the musubi and lau-lau in no time. Haha. My friends all liked what they ordered... I usually go for a bento box or local plate. Next time for sure.  Service was friendly just like the other location. Pay and order at the counter. You get a number and they bring you your food, drinks and utensils. I look forward to going back to this location whenever I'm in town to not only check out the other menu items but to see the bar area... I know this is where Anuhea performed when she was in town. That's awesome..",

Came with 3 slabs of chicken with skin on, 2 scoops of rice, and mac salad.  The garlic chicken was just okay. Kind of bland, skin not as crispy as I'd like it to be. Also, I barely was given a scoop of mac salad.   My friend ordered halo halo which looked disappointing for $5. On the other hand, the adobo omelet looked delicious.  I'll stick to Aloha Specialties the next time around.",

The karaoke DJ also seemed to favor the larger groups of regulars.  I was here for a work party with a large group, but many of our song submissions were delayed in favor of other people's requests.  The \"regulars\" also seemed to favor ballads, which sort of killed the mood, but I understand the house can't control that too much.",

He was on the mic all night, hosting dance contests and frequently congratulating our retiree friend...making him feel special. Extensive karaoke list. Cute little, lounging area with a good amount of places to sit. And our party-goers could go next door for some yummy Aloha Kitchen food. I highly recommend hosting a party here.",

I suggest trying the Lau-Lau plate. I'd say the prices are pretty reasonable for a quick fix of islander food.   The parking is plenty. And it's huge for having a family side and a party side.

Clearly the manager of this restaurant doesn't know that a service animal and their handler are protected against the Federal Law and that a person with a service dog may voluntarily present any proof but is NOT required to do so and you may not insist on proof or ask a person to leave because they could not, or would not, present any paperwork. In the end, they noticed, as I pointed out, the card on the dog's vest stating that law and she left. 2 stars because the food was good and the other cashier was friendly, but overall, very irritated that a manager doesn't know the laws and even I myself, who was once a manager elsewhere, knew that..",

Place looked clean enough and prices reasonable. I had combo of Chicken Katsu & Chicken curry. My friend had the bbq combo(Katsu, teri chicken & kalbi). Both our katsu's were a bit overdone because the outside was pretty dark brown and tasted accordingly. The 2 scoops of rice looked more like 3. The mac salad was decent. I had a taste of my friend's teri chicken and I could tell it wasn't marinated bbq/teri chicken I'm used to having back in Hawaii growing up. It was just grilled chicken that had a lightly colored sweet sauce on top. The katsu did come with the thick, sweet tangy traditional japanese katsu sauce. I would come back to perhaps to try other items here. The first visit though was just ok.",

    "text": "If you know me, I'm a huge fan of cheap eats and local dives. I'm also all about tasting and sniffing out foods that I can't get ahold of back home. Home being here in Cali. So when my friends suggested to my girlfriend and our \"Vegas Travel Crew\" to stop by Aloha Kitchen and try the Adobo Omelet, we decided to come down and see what the buzz was all about. Sadly, I and my fellow associates were quite displeased with what we sank our teeth into.   I don't know if it was the idea of an Adobo Omelet that excited us or the hype that our friends were making but all of us were really eager to try it but we ended up very disappointed with it. There was nothing really special about it. It was just rice inside an omelet. In fact, the rice itself was bland and dry. There was nothing about that dish that resembled Adobo other than the brown color of the rice, which I repeat, was bland and dry. To put it bluntly, that Omelet sucked balls. It was kind of hard to face our friends and give them a fake smile and say, \"Oh that shit was bomb! We're definitely going back to have another one when we come back again.\"   In all honesty, we would have been better off just ordering the Chicken Katsu or Loco Moco. But that would kind of defeat the purpose of going there in the first place because if I wanted L&L, I would have just gone there before we came to Vegas or waited until I got back. I can at least say I tried it so that has to count for something.  I'll give Aloha Kitchen a little mercy and say at least the hours are great and perfect for after clubbing dining. Unlike the people who I thought were my friends, I will look out for those of you who are planning on visiting Aloha Kitchen and recommend having anything other than the Adobo Omelet... unless you're high. In that case, please share and then order the Adobo Omelet because that's the only way you would get me to ever eat that thing again.",

The bento box consisted of the usual rice, piece of spam, what was suppose to be a piece of chicken but cover by a fatty skin, little cubes of meat that looked like leftover cuts from other meals, all cover by a horrid sauce.  SAUCE on everything in a BENTO box!!!  $8.50 for that?? The teriyaki sandwich was really just a burnt cheeseburger with nothing on it. Not even real beef. And with fries? No choice for normal mac salad. Rip off for $5.95 Only thing okay was the poki, because how can you mess up raw fish?  I talked with manager & she said that is the way its been for a year.  I remember when they had good food. Course no one working there is actually from Hawaii anymore so they don't know better. But owners should.  L&L better and that isn't always that great. I'd give this place a zero rating if I could.",

When I first moved to Vegas me and a friend were looking for some karaoke and just stumbled on the bar portion.

Anyway the atmosphere of just laid back fun is great, the karaoke is great fun and free, with a one drink minimum of course.",

It was a little hard to find, but once we found the place, we were golden. We came around 11 am and there were only a few people in there. It was probably because everyone was still sleeping! Haha.   The staff is friendly and the decor is perfect for a Hawaiian place. And the food, the food is BOMB. I ordered the adobo friend rice omelet and my friend ordered the spam and eggs. We all loved what we ordered! The adobo fried rice omelet was so so good. The rice was a little crunchy like fried rice is supposed to be and the adobo had a little crunch to it too. Just like my Lola makes it. Except it was wrapped in an omelet! Instead of the egg being in the rice like normal adobo fried rice, it was wrapped in it. Genius! Haha.  Anyway, I would definitely come back to this place and order the omelet again. It was that good!",

The difference in taste/texture complemented the food in such a weird way but it was yummy. Definitely adding kimchi to my order again.    First time ordering the miso soup too. I was a little hesitant with it cuz some places just use the powder and you can taste the blandness, but the flavor in this one was soooooo good. If I hantavirus ordered so much I would have downed the whole thing in a heartbeat!

    "text": "Aloha Kitchen and Bar is more like a three and a half stars.   I ordered chicken curry and I thought the chicken curry was going to be like Indian or Thai style, but I was wrong.  It was Hawaiian style and I have never heard of Hawaiian chicken curry.  It was different and they do not add coconut milk.  The dish was large--two scoops of rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and a large serving of chicken curry.  The large serving was worth eight dollars, but I did not finish it.    The karaoke bar was cool and entertaining.  However, I must caution you the music is loud, but I guess that is to be expected.  You get use to the noise once you are inside for a couple of hours.    There is a lot of karaoke music to choose from.  The binder is about four inches thick and the music ranges from Hawaiian, Tagalog, Spanish, rap, rock, country, pop, and r&b.  Basically, whatever song you choose, it might be in the binder.  The binder is alphabetized by song.  Vegas has a lot of hidden singers.  They are really talented.  They should try out for American Idol or America Has Talent.   In between songs, they play danceable music like line dancing (the Electric Slide) or hip-hop.   However, I must add sometimes the microphone does not work.    I did not sing because I was shy, but I guess if I were drunk, I wouldn't mind singing a song.",

It's also a good portion for $3.50ish. I was disappointed with the manaupas because the bread was hard and did not taste fresh at all. I thought because I came late that's why so i tried again at 12 pm thinking they made it fresh in the beginning of the day, but I was wrong so I wouldn't recommend those.",

Best thing about Aloha Kitchen is it is open super late and has a bar/lounge next door with alcohol. Food is good and the prices are better and the portions are generous. Adobo/Katsu combo is my favortie with portuguese sausage masubi. The Hawaiian Iced Tea is made super sweet though and the sun juices are a little pricier then the ABC store; but thats about the only gripes i have with the place.  As mentioned, the bar next door usually plays local top 40 and sometimes island jams and reggae, the drinks are mixed well and priced just right. They even got slots and video poker!   if your looking for a grub spot away from the strip, i would definitely go here, you will not regret it!",

Arriving at midnight, the bartender was terrible and showed frustration, unable to keep up with clientele. Pricey for a bar off the strip, and the atmosphere of \"gangland\" was definitely in the air. Foods from next door, was ok. However the customer service was terrible. The show of fatigue and frustration was evident via the employees, which made it very uncomfortable. All in all, what everyone hyped up about this place is so off, better with a cooler in the parking and ordering food to go.",

Theres times where my rice is just so watery, feels like it may be a couple ounces away from being a porridge, if your eating a rice dish sometimes rice can make or break your entree. There is times when the chicken comes out looking and feeling like a raw defrosted chicken even when ordered skinless its so flimsy like its only been cooked for a few seconds. Another bad thing about this place is how they run your food. If theres more than one person sitting at a table i dont think one person should get their food 5-10 min before the others. Its just wrong going to eat with someone and basically they eat without you or you without them.. Or they wait and by the time yours or their food comes yours is already cold. Other than that when the food is cooked right its very delicious. They have very good potential of being one of the best hawaiian places in town but consistency kills.",

    "text": "I hate to do this -- but here goes . . . . I was totally craving local food (aka Mom's cooking) and thought I'd get my fix at Aloha Kitchen.  I'm from Maui, so . . . there's nothing quite like Mom's, but I thought this might come close.   Our group had the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teri beef plates with the rice and mac salad.  I can't say any of the above was worth a repeat visit.   The katsu - I make better katsu myself and with that being said, I think L&L's katsu is better and . . . that's still L&L, not Mom's.  This was very garlicy, small strips of thin chicken with more crunch than chicken.  The sauce was ok, not best ever, but ok. Honestly could not finish it, I threw 1/2 of it away and I never do that. It was THAT bad.  And for the record, I had the bubbly stomach (gas) effect all afternoon.  Gross.  I think I have a problem with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was average and teri beef was chewy.  Sauce was ok, but like a 2-star says . . . \"Meh. I've experienced better\".    I was most disappointed with the hard, dry rice - it's not hard to cook rice!!  Even my 8 year old makes better rice - cmon now!!  And then came the mac salad which again, L&L does better.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  And it certainly wasn't Mom's.    Would I go back?  Nope.  It's close to my work and I'd love to say I would.  But nope.  Place was pretty crowded though and I've been told to \"order breakfast next time\", but I wasn't feeling breakfast at 12:00 Noon.",

The service is not that great when it comes to the older lady at the front. I have tried the other place on Maryland and it is a little bit better. I think the spam musubi is overpriced as well as all of the food. At least for the taste. Please review your food Aloha Kitchen...I'm headed for the franchised Hawaiian restaurants.",

I ordered the teriyaki meal, special combo and an order of lumpias. The food smelled so good, it reminded me of A & A's in Samoa. When I tore into the plates, I was so disappointed. The teriyaki had a very weak flavor almost bland. I could have done without the chicken and Kim chee which was jarred from any grocery store. Such a huge let down after craving this food for so long.",

But I have tried other favorites like  Mahi mahi katsu combo, also the teriyaki chicken and they're as good as...well, spam. This place is always busy so the word is out.

The staff is friendly and always walking around to make sure the customers are doing well.  If we come in the morning we get the topsilog (Filipino breakfast dish) with over medium eggs, loco moco which is a HI staple. Their saimin is always a good go to if you looking for something light but filling. Now they offer oxtail soup year round with 2 heaping scoops of rice its SOOOOOO ono. The combination plate is the way to go if your not sure on what you want to eat it has a little bit of everything you cant go wrong and it comes with mac salad.   Defiantly try their adobo omelet you wont be disappointed their are a few restaurants in town that offer it on their menu but there's something about Aloha's that just does it better, my fam from SD always requests me to pick one up when they are in town, and if they drove themselves they take one to go its that good.   word of advice: If your coming during lunch OR your short on time do yourself a favor and call your order in a head of time.",

My bestie gets her spam musubi (which I don't eat anymore, but she says it legit tastes Hawaii style).   It's difficult to get Hawaiian Sun drinks on the East Coast especially my fave, passion orange flavor. When I'm in Vegas I get several cans from Aloha and put them in my hotel fridge! I also have to admit I've packed some and brought it back to FL once. I grew up drinking that stuff on the daily.  This may not be fine dining, but it reminds me of the plate lunches back home in Hawaii and a trip to Vegas isn't the same unless I stop in.",

So we decided to order from Yelp via Grubhub. It gave a timeline of when it would be ready but it was actually faster than it said it would be.   We had it delivered for our Airbnb and they came up to the door. I already had something to try from here because the other morning, we had their pork adobo omelette. It was good so we decided to get local food.   I went with the longganisa and rice while my boyfriend decided to get the teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef and two musubis. We also got Shanghai lumpia. It was just like food back home. I loved it. It satisfied my tummy. It was convenient and yummy. I would order from there again or go there to eat when in Vegas!",

But in the past few months the food is barely edible, while the service has gotten worse and worse. We had to wait 30 minutes for a beef bowl, and the taste was horrible, tasted like leftovers from a few days ago. Lately every time we go there the waiting times are becoming longer and the servers ignore customers. They also overcharged us a few times; at first we were naive to believe it was a mistake and asked them to correct it. We obviously realized it's a pattern by now.  As for their bar, I wouldn't recommend either, it smells horrible and the servers seem to hide behind the bar or not even be there at all. Not sure why, you'd expect them to want to serve and get tipped... Oh well. We won't be back...",

Food is okay, you can get a lot of Filipino Hawaiian staples like Loco Moco, Spam Musubi, Kalbi, Lumpia. Ordered the Tapsilog a couple of times, flavors were definitely on point but the beef itself was tough so it was disappointing. There isn't an option to do garlic rice either which is vital for a Tapsilog in my opinion. They have plenty to offer on the menu so I'm sure you can find something that will appease your palate. The place needs serious updating though. But when you're drunk and hungry it's the least of your worries I'm sure.",

I LOVE how they have really good artists always playing!   This place is both filipino & Hawaiian food.. I've been going here way more than i should of but def. no regrets there. IM ALWAYS craving Hawaiian food or poke. My boyfriend and I always order the same plate just because its literally so good we don't even want to order anything else. So many different plates to choose from so we both really need to step out of our comfort zone lol! Amazing quality and price for the food. I would choose a plate any day then dine in a fancy establishment.   Service was really good and knowledgeable! :) always chill people in the store which is a plus.. I love it. I can come here to study as well because that's how mellow the atmosphere is. Totally can't decide between Aloha kitchen and L&L anymore just because I wish at Aloha kitchen they let you have a mixed plate like half chicken katsu and half loco moco where they can mix plates in half. But unfortunately they dont.. But service and environment def. goes to Aloha kitchen. But food options and portions goes to L&L. Both have amazing quality though!   Local Plate: 10/10 around  2 Spam musibi, teriyaki chicken, beef and a scoop of rice with macaroni salad   Kalibi rib combo: 8/10 around  Teriyaki chicken, Kalibi Ribs, Chicken Katsu and a scoop of rice with macaroni salad  *Didnt like how sometimes my order portion comes out small and other time big and they sometimes skimp on kalibi ribs too  But overall, ALWAYS coming back for more! Can't get enough of this place. I wish there was a drive thru lol so i can get it like fast food",

I always ordered their Local Plate which includes a scoop of rice, chicken & beef teriyaki, two spam musubi, & macaroni salad. It's around $8-9 without a drink. I thought it was a pretty good deal which is why it's my go to order each & every time.   However, I recently placed a take out order from here & got my usual. When I arrived home, I opened the box and was really disappointed at what I saw. There used to be a big portion of chicken and beef teriyaki, but now it only looks like it's just the leftover, unwanted part of the meal. You know when you eat your meal & whatever is leftover, you give it to the family dog? Well, that's exactly what the beef teriyaki looked like. It was such a small portion, I was disappointed. It wasn't like how it used to be where the portions were a good size for the price you pay.   I do have to add that the people who work here are very sweet and welcoming. That's probably one of the reasons why I come back. The food is delicious & the people are great. However, the serving sizes? Disappointing.",

One combo had teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken and grilled fish. The other combo had teriyaki chicken, chicken Katsu and bone-in short ribs. The beef was a little tough and stringy. The chicken was tender since they used thigh meat. I didn't like the teriyaki sauce though - it was way too sickly sweet and I wished I had soy sauce for the meat instead. They also give a lot of rice, which is what we needed after a late night out. The mac salad was okay. I don't think I'd get food from here again, but it was alright.",

I stop in here because it's close to work, centrally located, and like I said, Aloha Kitchen helps scratch at that craving.  Last visit, I tried the beef curry stew, which I think was a special ... it was like a huge chunk of potato, couple pieces of carrot, and some stringy beef, with the requisite large scoops of rice and mac salad.  Not impressed.  Should have stuck with the tried-n-True adobo fried rice omelette.  Service is usually friendly and the wait is not too long.  A big plus is that the interior decor has been spiffed up considerably, the colors are inviting, and it seems much fresher inside.",

    "text": "So \"Aloha\" means both hello and goodbye -- now how can I work that into my review?  Here goes:  To begin with it, I've never seen a combination bar and Hawaiian fast food place.  Aloha (Hello) Kitchen reminds me of a typical Hawaiian fast food place: well lit with a lot of cheesy decor. Besides having the basic plates, they also carried some unique stuff. I tried the Adobo Fried Rice and the wife tried the Saimin soup.  The food wasn't really anything to yelp about, but since it is a chain kinda place, you shouldn't expectation too much. I'd be willing to go back just because they serve poke (one of the items I don't find at a fast food place) on Friday and Saturday. So until then, Aloha (Goodbye) Kitchen.  Aloha (Hello) Bar is right next door to the Kitchen but is a 180 from the Kitchen: dark with a dive feel to it.  But it still gave off the laid back Island life vibe. Bartender was cool and even spoke to me in dakine.  Thanks. She stopped though when my face went blank and didn't respond.  Sorry. The music had the kinda beats I could groove to for a couple hours, and the crowd was chill. After a some drinks and a couple games of pool, I was saying Aloha (Goodbye) Bar.  Good thing since they just fired up the karaoke machine.  Overall, I'll be saying Aloha (Hello) sooner to the Bar than the Kitchen.  A special aloha to all the Vegas Yelpers from Hawaii. There are a bunch.",

    "text": "My Roomie Nicki G. was out & about for lunch on Valentines day, looking for a new Hawaiian BBQ place, since the one closest to us had changed their menu to all Chinese.   Needless to say, I had looked to the Yelpeeps for some answers & started searching & reading countless reviews. So, I mentioned this place to her & showed her the menu. It all looked pretty good & some of the reviews seemed very promising. Unfortunately, that is as far as it went. She brought back a Kalbi combo for me, which included Chicken Katsu & Teri Chicken.   I was super hungry & I was looking forward to digging in. However, I have to say I wasn't very impressed with the portions, especially the mac salad, which was in like really small cup. Not to mention the fact that is kind of had an odd taste to it, kind of like the way a Dentist's office smells. To me, this plate seemed like a mini plate & not like a regular. The 2 scoops of rice equaled about the size of 1 scoop you would find in a regular.   As far as taste goes, it was mediocre at best. Not very flavorful as far as the marinade went. The Kalbi was a little on the small side, as well as the Katsu & Teri Chicken. I didn't end up eating all of the Katsu, it just didn't seem like it was prepared very well. I don't know, maybe got spoiled living in Hawaii & just have high expectations.   Overall, based on this experience, I don't think I would return or even recommend this place. If anyone cares to compare, take a look at my L&L review & look at those pics of my plate lunch in comparison the pics I am posting for this review.   Just a side note: To me, mac salad is kind of like salsa. It is a very simple thing to make & even make it taste pretty good. However, a lot of places find some way to mess it up. I have been to many a good Mexican restaurant, but somehow the salsa is always bad. I don't know though, what can do? :P",

    "text": "Oh boy oh boy.... Where do I begin..  I saw their advertisement for about 2 weeks for their xmas day buffet for $15.  The list of food sounded great and included many typical hawaiian items.  I arrived there around 7.  It was fairly quiet/empty and figured most people came there earlier. There were probably only 20 people in there when I arrived.   1st off the service was great. The employees were very nice and I definitely expected that being in a hawiian restaurant.  The place was also very clean and that too was not an issue.    The food is the main issue here.  When I walked upto the buffet, the sushi table had 3 basic rolls on there and was ok at best.  The lumpia was probably the most decent thing I ate.  I was in total shock when I saw the spam musubi.  They had it all nice looking, all cut in half in nice big pieces (this would've been perfect but NOOOO they screwed it up.) They had some sort of sauce on ALL of it. The problem is you CAN'T put sauce on a rice item like this that is sitting there.  I had one bite and it completely fell apart in my hand because the sauce had made the whole thing mushy.    The katsu was overcooked and dried out.  The halfway decent stir fry veggies were sorta ok but they were sitting under a heat lamp and getting mushy and all in all lacked flavor.  The curry was very bland. I tried a little of a few other dishes and again everything was bland and blah.  I was completely disappointed in the macaroni salad. WOW it had nooooo flavor to it. It was just simply mayonaisse.    The desserts were store bought donuts, some chocolate chip cookies, and some funky brownies.  and btw I saw other people sitting around me making faces too about the food.   There's a few problems here. #1 let's compare apples to apples... Aloha kitchen vs L&L Hawaiian. This buffet gave me a really good idea of what their food is like if I ordered it off their regular menu (vs buffet style) I have been to L&L many many times and wow they are definitely a LOT better then Aloha.  I have tried several things on their menu and everything has been flavorful, yummy, not over cooked and their macaroni salad is great too.   1 out of 10.. Aloha you're a 1.  L&L a 10. There was nothing good about the food at Aloha and I was VERY disappointed.  Now comparison #2.  Although now I'm comparing apples to oranges but still.    Aloha vs buffet @ asia which is just minutes up the street.  Aloha, you can not charge $15 for what you put on that buffet with that kind of quality.  Buffet @ Asia is WAY better then you in quality and selection for the same price.  Just sushi alone puts you to shame (and they don't have any fantastic sushi either but it's way better then yours)  and with Sushi Mon being 10 min up the street as well, they blow both places out of the water.    It's very tough to run a good restaurant, but if L&L can have almost all the same menu items and they do it right with quality, and taste and the same price, then so can you. Aloha kitchen.... You're a discrace to good hawaiian food.    I will continue my business at L&L",

I wasn't too hungry but had a craving for shanghai lumpia $2.99 which hit the spot and ordered spam musubi $1.99 don't really know anywhere else to get lumpia without being invited to some family party, this will do until then, **4 stars for now because is there anyway you can possibly mess up shanghai lumpia or spam musubi? May change once I try the adobo fried rice omelette  **update: ordered the adobo fried rice omelette, didn't know what to expect, but imagine a thin omelette burrito stuffed with a fried rice/ adobo mixture.  The portion was huge but a little on the dry side, I had to add soy sauce/siracha to juice it up.  Otherwise, okay, not what I expected, it's basically fried rice and adobo with scrambled eggs.",

    "text": "Open until 3am, so it's a top choice for late night Hawaiian Filipino fusion. Just make sure to get there before 2:30am, that's when the kitchen closes.   We ordered the Loco moco $6.29, which was classically prepared: hamburger patty topped with a thick gravy and a fried egg all over rice. The hamburger meat was dry and the gravy was lacking much flavor. My boyfriend loves loco moco, but he wasn't happy with this version. I've came to the conclusion that I'm just not a fan of loco moco in general. I suppose I've just never had one that blew my tastebuds away. It's typically pretty bland with no real explosion or layers of flavor. I also can't get past the weird cornstarch gravy consistency. 2/5  The chicken katsu plate $7.69, came with a generous portion of fried chicken with 2 scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad and a side of katsu sauce. The chicken was super crispy and fried to a dark golden brown (no it didn't taste burned), it was actually pretty moist inside. I've had better katsu sauce, but it wasn't bad - it was simple and does the job. Other than that, I didn't have any real complaints with this dish. A great price for what you get. Just make sure you're prepared for the food coma afterwards, it settles like a brick in your stomach. 4/5  The mac salad was simple, (just tatsted like mayo) but I enjoyed it. It went perfectly with the katsu plate. I ended up ordering an additional side for $1.99. The perfect bite: dip chicken katsu into katsu sauce, take a bite with rice and some mac salad all together... Perfect! 4/5  The spam musubi $1.99, was about the length of a dollar bill and had a thin slice of spam (didn't even fill the length of the musubi), some sweet gravy-like-sauce, and a brick of rice held together by seaweed. There was a ton of rice, but I ate it carefully making sure that each bite actually got some spam and sauce in, and it was pretty good. 3/5",

I don't go often but when I do there's always that same consistency in knowing that whatever I get it'll be good :)   We ate - kalbi ribs plate , bbq chicken plate, and the mixed plate . Prices are very reasonable and the amount of food they give is generous . They swapped out my side of macaroni salad for mixed veggies even though that's not a listed side :) .   The kalbi ribs plate is my go to . I love the flavor and the meat is juicy and cooked perfectly .",

You cant go to a place called aloha kitchen and not get musubi's!  These were of good size and a nice thick cut of spam unlike same places there the ratio is more rice than spam.  Adobo fried rice <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#7HB73c6cPjKml2mVyEt2kw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aloh...</a>  This was a pretty tasty omelette with lots of adobo inside.  Def a must get!  I didn't actually go to pick up the order so I cant speak to how the place is.  Eyes ~ Wow that is a spread! Nose ~ Smells Yum!. Ear ~ Everyone happy with the food. Mouth ~ These are all pretty ono!. Tummy ~ Full and ready for the day!",

Sat down to eat, opened the bag to find no Katsu sauce. Chicken Katsu cannot be eaten without Katsu sauce. Called aloha kitchen, call transferred to Isaiah who stated he handed the sauce to the door dash driver so if I didn't get the sauce, it's because the driver didn't give it to me. I called the driver who confirmed no sauce was handed to him. I called Isaiah backed who insisted he did in fact hand the sauce to the driver. Not sure why the Katsu sauce wasn't placed in the bag to begin with. Isaiah said they were busy with orders and that there was nothing he could do for me but to apologize. Well, I'm sorry, but an apology doesn't deliver Katsu sauce to me. And I just wasted money on a chicken Katsu plate that I didn't eat because without the sauce, it's not the same. I asked to speak with a manager, but of course the manager is off today and Isaiah is \"covering\" today. Sorry, but this is not Aloha. This is not how you conduct service recovery. Aloha kitchen has just lost business from me and my family.  Too bad, because Aloha Kitchen was one of our favorites. Oh well, Lots of other good local food eateries to choose from in Las Vegas these days.",

I lived on Oahu, West side, and I'm always down for some good plate lunch.  My husband and I had the Samin (fried noodles with pork and cabbage) a loco moco and spam musubi.  The Samin was AMAZING!!! Reminded me of the auntie on the corner who used to sell plates to all the neighborhood, in Wainaie. Very flavorful, and cooked to perfection!  The loco moco was impressive. The gravy was full of flavor and a great consistency. The eggs were perfectly cooked so the yolk spilled all over the meat. A lot of places over cook the fried egg... compliments to the chef! The spam musubi was great too!  We brought our family and have been recommending it to all of our local friends! We will be back every time we come to Vegas!",

This location was open until 5 am, but last call for food orders was 4:30.  We have my daughter with us, but were told to stay on the restaurant side. We ordered the adobo fried rice omelette, oxtail soup, katsu & kahlua pork combo, and a spam breakfast with rice and eggs.  We were so hungry that we went back to order a second spam breakfast and the adobo plate.  We always stop in to eat here whenever we are in town.  Maybe twice. Once we introduced my parents to the adobo fries rice omelette, they ask for it every time.  The wait for our food was not long. The food is delicious, the portions are generous, and the prices are light on your wallet.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. The dining area is immaculately clean.  They do not let tables sit piled with dirty dishes.  After saying good bye, the tables are cleared and ready for the next hungry customers.   Sorry that I don't have pictures of food. We were very hungry! Maybe next time, folks!",

The prices are a little higher than most Hawaiian food places in town but also, there's some finds that are of quality and of low cost, like the chicken with gravy I got! (Chicken teriyaki bowl substitute teriyaki with gravy. I love their gravy!)   The service here is always so quick and so friendly, it makes the experience that much better. Always walking in and being greeted with aloha is the best thing. Especially when you go to other restaurants and you don't get near the same hospitality!   My boyfriend got a local plate which has all the staples and a side of kimchee. The kimchee is nice and crispy and the soak in their spam musubis are not on the light side.   I will be back here time and time again whether it be during the day or late at night to get my aloha fix. Thank you so much aloha kitchen for being consistent, keep doing what you're doing!",

So, do I hit the Vegas strip and fight for parking or just pull in park and eat.   Why not.  Nothing like I expected. Teriyaki sauce is delicious with its own flavor. It's hard to explain other than it tasted like teriyaki yet it was an original flavor. It had just the right amounts on the beef and so much for eating half and the rest later. Yup, I crushed it all in one sitting. Roll me out of here. The sticky rice was on point. The Hawaiian macaroni salad, boom delicious.   The ambiance kind of reminded me of an old back in the day diner. Nothing to write home about but I quickly forgot about looking around and was hypnotized by the food.   Bathroom clean and that makes me happy inside. In a warm kind of way.   The customer service was everything Aloha.   Mahalo.",

Lol just bc it's called \"Aloha kitchen\" n serves local food doesn't mean it's owned by a local person lol! A True local would've understood this!

Aloha Service & Ambiance:  Total mom and pop resto with booths and tables from when I used to frequent here back in the day.  Hawaiian mood music plays in the background.  The open dining area is clean and quaint.  You put your order in, given a number and the staff will deliver your food to the table.  The drinks are self serve so most of the staff is in the kitchen or delivering which helps get the food out quickly.  Aloha grindage:  I went with the local plate and everything was all good.  The chicken and beef were marinated and cooked well. The spam musubis were fresh and the mac salad was on point.  I tried the garlic chicken and it was delicious.  I think that's what we're going with next visit  All the plates we ordered offered generous volume and it's easy to take food home here unless you're pretty hungry.  If I was on this side of town more often, I could see way more visits.  For now it's nice to know that Aloha Kitchen is still sending out good Hawaiian food for reasonable prices.  It won't be so long until the next visit.  Mahalo!",

    "text": "I wanted to order a Hawaiian plate which has pork Lau Lau and kala pig. Unfortunately, they ran out of Lau Lau at 4pm. Then again, my wife reminded me that I don't like Lau Lau. Haha, So no deductions there. I got the Kalbi Combo instead. Kalbi was really good and easy to chew! Chicken teriyaki and katsu were both yummy as well!   I only did 4 stars due to the wonton soup. We both thought it was too salty. I initially tried the soup and I can already taste the soup. The noodles were alright. The wonton itself were the saltiest part of it. You would think it would be the best part. It was tasted saltier than mcdonalds fries with extra salt.   Hopefully it was just our soup. Maybe if you order it, you won't have the same experience. But if you're meat water, the kalbi combo is a must!",

The last tine my husband and I came here, we both got the Wonton Saimin & two spam musubis. You would think that the saimin bowls are small until you get them. They are huge bowls of saimin! We of course demolished the saimin like it was nothing. The wontons are bursting with flavor, the saimin broth was delicious. And of course, the spam musubis always taste like home.  FYI: try the pork adobo fried rice. It is cooked so well, the portion is huge. You won't regret it.",

This place also turns into a karaoke bar at night on the other side, so that would be awesome to check out one day, but as of now, this review is only for the restaurant side.  It was about ten in the morning when I made my way here and I only had one thing on the mind, okay maybe two things on the mind...Loco Moco and Spam Musabi.  The Loco Moco was very good. The hamburger patty was cooked well done but still very juicy. My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and they put just the right amount of gravy to cover every bite. Now the rice is what makes a good Loco Moco and they are gooood rice makers! Just the right amount of stickiness and firmness where it held the gravy on top but didn't soak it up. The spam Musabi was also freshly made. Spam was pan fried and hot and nori was still crispy with each bite. It is always a good sign that they take the time to make it to order and not premade.  Loved the diner feel to the place and will definitely be back to sink my teeth in the other goodies they offer!  Next time with maybe some karaoke!!",

The Kalbi combo is a big plate of barbeque meats and their Spam Musubi is addictive. Adobo Fried Rice Omelette though is a must have on the table, any other place in my opinion does not compare with Aloha Kitchen. If you're feeling soup, I recommend the oxtail soup. This location also have the karaoke place right next to it with a wet bar and while it gets pretty expensive it is a fun thing to option. It's also separate from the dining room which I thought was good because if you're not in a karaoke mood at least you're not forced to be around it.",

For those of you who doesn't know what Filipino adobo is it is meat simmered with soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaves, peppercorns and garlic. This is a staple food with Filipino's and I like to describe this spot as the Hawaiian/Filipino spot. Besides the famous adobo fried rice all their dishes here are pretty ono! So next time you are in Vegas, be sure to check out this spot....you'll love it!",

Their miso soup tastes just like a good miso you would find at a good sushi bar, and their stir fry items are filling.  The two best things about this location is the karaoke and the bar (I know, right?!) Their beers aren't expensive but not *too* cheap, reasonable enough to have a good time while you're sitting back watching people sing and dance to karaoke. The karaoke is a blast! Went with a group of my co-workers, one of the most festive nights we've had, and the regulars that are there are very sociable and willing to sing/dance along too!   This location isn't mobbed so service and waiting for karaoke is fast. One of my favorite local locations where I want to go for a casual and fun night out without getting dressed up, or going to an actual bar.",

Not 20 minutes after the 45 minutes had already passed. I hope the delivery guy considers the fee his tip. The local plate was disgusting, greasy and the musubi smelled rank and old.

I like mine with a little gravy outside and in and egg yolk inside with hot sauce. I've been hooked on the  cut short ribs I can only seem to find back in Oceanside, CA at Guahan Grill, but their Kalbi short ribs are good too. The white rice on all their plates is good and consistent. The service could be better, but not indicative of rating. The cashier can get bogged down and the napkins are small and they never give enough. I need to come here in the winter as they have oxtail soup which is hard to find. Here is what a lot of people don't think about or know is that there is no hard breakfast or time to eat breakfast in the islands or in Vegas so getting their food at 3 because you didn't get to sleep until 9 am from partying all night long is not a shame, but probably the norm.",

I liked that it was open till 5am, the cashier was polite, and it was relatively cheap.    The adobo omelette itself was a bit salty but decent.  I was expecting greatness but didn't really experience it w/ this.  Perhaps the eggs and the adobo together just wasn't working for me, but I will give them a plus on portion size.  The damn thing was the size of an extra large burrito that you'd find at a Mexican restaurant.    Overall it's definitely a place worth trying.  If you're staying on the strip and looking for some Hawaiian / Filipino food to grub on it's about 5 miles and a $21 cab ride away, so go with friends.  Who knows, you might like it.",

    "text": "The heat while driving on westside of Vegas got me thirsty and starving for something similar to \"home\". Upon seeing the large sign from Sahara's roadway I decided to have an \"Aloha\" lunch.  I walked up to the order station. A menu with price listing was on a board above the order & cashier station. I ordered \"Saimin Soup\" , \"Combination Bowl with Vegetables\" and \"Coconut Juice\". I paid and was given a number tile with the number \"15\", to be called out for me to pick up my food order when it is ready. I chose to sit on a table under a \"tiki\" canopy overlooking the restaurant's wall of windows which brings in the day's sun. Nice, feeling like in the South Seas with colorful painting on its wall to add to the feeling.  Food was served on my table. My number was not called out. Great service!! Hot, steamy, yummy \"Saimin Soup\" was just right for my taste. I ordered it because I like soup and it had noodles. As it is my birthday, the long noodles stands for \"long life\". Mmmm, goood. The \"Combination Bowl with Vegetables\" was not ordinary with a special brown sauce over steamy white rice in a bowl. My Mom liked that, it was tasty. Our thirst was quenched by Coconut Juice on ice. Healthy and goood drink!   The atmosphere is ambient in this Hawaiian & Filipino Restaurant serving both Hawaiian & Filipino favorites such as Pork Adobo, Kalua Pig & Cabbage served with macaroni salad & rice, Loco Moco, Chicken Curry, Hula/Hawaiian Plate, Tapsilog, Bento Box (of beef, teriyaki chicken, spam with pickled plum & furikake fish flakes), Kalbi Ribs, Mahi-Mahi dish, Lumpia Shanghai (my favorite) to name a few. Appetizers, Soups, Salads, Side Orders, Combination Plates, Specials, Sandwiches, Beverages, Breakfast & a Kids Meals are on the menu. One thing missing on the menu is Dessert. That's just fine with me as I was full from the meal. There is a Karaoke Bar in the Restaurant that opens in the evening through early morning.   Enjoyed it, a good reasonably price meal for the day!",

It comes with like a sweet glaze you can pour over the ribs. of coarse I order extra macarroni salad! Why? Because it's delicious! The kalbi plate also comes with white rice and a small cabbage salad. I've also had the student special witch is teriyaki chicken on top of white rice. Yumm! My husband also orders the loco moco one of his favorites after he has had a few drinks. & ofcoare we can't forget the spam masubi. He has to have one of those everytime we go. I love how they remodel there Decatur location looks very nice & it's always clean! It has a very chill atmosphere. It's opened late and it's cheap. They also deliver & cater. They have a karaoke bar next door witch of the four years of us going there we have never been next door lol but everytime we are in the dinning area we can hear how the people at the bar are enyoing them selves. There staff is very friendly (they know us now lol) I highly recomended when you are in the mood to eat something good not expensive and just chill.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here on our Vegas vacation recently and loved this place. It's in a rather old, smoky casino hotel called The California, and not to be missed if you love a good Vegas bargain and Hawaiian food plates. We ordered some Spam Musubi to try, which is pretty much Spam sushi with the seaweed rolled on the outside. Unusual and delicious! Not to mention cheap. I ordered the Teriyaki Hamburger Steak, which comes with the prerequisite rice and creamy macaroni salad. It was really good, with brown gravy and onions but reminded me more of Salisbury steak than a teriyaki dish. The portions at this place are huge too! I couldn't finish mine. My husband could, but he's an Italian guy who can eat. My husband got the Teriyaki Chicken and let me try it. Friends, this is how teriyaki should taste. Grilled and tender, with a flavorful teriyaki sauce that tastes fresh made and not from a bottle. They have the best hot green tea, too. It was a roasted green tea, and I loved it so much I hunted it down at an Asian supermarket in Vegas before we left. It's called YamaMotoYama Hoji-cha Roasted Green Tea and it's delicious. Didn't have any room for dessert, though. Very friendly staff there. You order and pay at the cash register and they bring it to you. Decor was delightful yet understated Hawaiian/Asian. Prices are unbelievable, especially with the quality of food and the portions - our dinner plates were $8 or less. Enjoyed it immensely!",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of things about this place. The good and the bad, but all I seemed to get when I finally decided to give it a shot is the ugly. There was a long line with two working registers, but only one person working both. It was pretty sketchy because one register was only excepting cash and the other one only credit cards. It caused such an inconvenience and their system was very inconsistent. They had one other person behind the counter expediting and running out the orders. I ordered the local plate and the ahi poke. My friend had the kalbi and lumpia. This is the culmination of my very disappointing lunch: carbs doused is sugar with a side of protein. Everything was just so sweet. I am all about the balance between sweet and salty but damn what a shame! It was all too sweet for my liking. AND the poke! FROZEN in the center! It was just big cubes of frozen fish. Tuna is a beautiful protein and should never be frozen, any seafood in that matter. When I told them about it, they sent it to the kitchen and when it got back to me the plate was warm. They popped fish that was meant to be served fresh in the microwave. WHAT A SHAME! My friend's kalbi was too sweet as well. Good char but too much sugar. The lumpia was mediocre. I didn't care much for it. Also, the place was very dirty. It looked so unorganized and dusty behind the counter.  Will I ever come back? That's a definite NO.  Would I ever recommend it? HELL NO.",

For the sake of argument I said it's okay just put in the order. She keeps implying that we didn't order it and that I am rude. I told her she shouldn't talk to their customers like that. She said she's been in customer service longer than I have lived. And kept saying I'm rude in Tagalog which is a Philippine dialect. Worst experience ever. And this was all happening in front of the manager and she just stood their. And did nothing. Very disappointed of the restaurant.",

The bottom line is that Island Style on Sahara (and in the Green Land Market) does a similar menu much, much better.",

I was a bit bummed that the Ox Tail soup was not on their menu so oh well... i'll just get the Loco Moco. But while standing in line and look what I see..... A printed out sign.

They say it's almost done. I've heard good things about this place. But I think that goes to show that you shouldn't always believe what you hear. 45 minutes into our dinner we finally just get a refund and leave. To top it all off. The Loco Moco that I got has to be the worst I have ever had in my life. And I'm polynesian. I've eaten Loco Moco from everywhere I know sells it. And this was the worst. Meat was dry. Little bit of gravy. And only 1 piece of meat. I would not recommend this place to my biggest enemy. If they had only half a stay that's what they would get",

I just made a mental note to check after being burned a couple times. Everyone i have talked to had the same to say about them too. Except going in today on my lunch and waiting for more than 30 mins just to find out that they had not even made my order, it was just me and there was no line and the dining room was not full, i also was sitting at a table in plain view with my order number tag on the table. nobody ever bothered to check into it although they kept seeing me??? like what am i just bringing my own number tag into the place and sitting there for my health, I dont like to be rude to ppl at work or to piss anyone off who makes my food especially, but after 30 mins i had to find out what was going on. i simply asked that if they hadn't made my food yet, just to give me my money back because i was going to be late to work. Then they tried to give me someone else order, the wrong order, and after i realized that they said they could switch my order to someone elses food that was sitting on the counter, wtf? so i finaly got my money back and went to del taco on the way back to work and i will be in trouble for being late, but thats my fault for not being more pushy. either way i have forgotten about this place and would recommend that anyone else do the same unless you like no service and getting screwed over. btw i do not yelp and have only really signed up for this review.",

Also maybe Aloha kitchen should remodel a bit because some of their booths chairs are ripping.

Although flavorful, they leave the skin on the chicken which has a lot of fat. I'm not a fan of it. The macaroni salad was ok but not amazing. The food did come out quickly and the customer service was great. But I'll stick to my other local favorite Hawaiian place.",

Maybe something else is better on the menu.",

After picking it up 20 minutes after placing the call, rather then getting fresh food, all was soggy, lumpia was soggy and cold and the forgot to give us katsu sauce. I called and spoke to Sally the manager, in which all she said sorry and who the name was on the receipt. It was Mariane. Not looking for anything free, just looking for fresh good food  which did not happen, and there was no try on guest recovery.  Not worth the $25 bucks, and definitely had a fast food management mentality. Too bad.",

We came in about 2 hours before they closed and I got my usual, spam musubi, I've been in love with this treat since I was in middle school and I love when I get to have some in rare occasion since spam is not too good for you, but my treat was ruined that night... It seemed that I was given old already prepared ones because the edges of the rice parts were hard and crusty. Such a disappointment! I barely ever have this food and this one time I was craving it so bad and I wasn't given their best... Not even good. So aside from my food being a total waste of money, the place was clean and I love the layout of this place! My friends and I would come here some times. They have a door to the place next door, I think it's a bar... I like their drink selection too! I recommend the guava canned drink! It's so good! I had some good times here but I won't be back. I'm not happy I was given old crusty food.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars for sure.  Me, I'm local boy living in Vegas since my UNLV days.  And I always crave for food from back home.  If it comes with 2 scoops calrose rice (not this Uncle Ben stuff), and 1 scoop mac salad I give it a go!  I haven't been here in a while so I'm gonna leave the prices out on this one.  Sorry Hawaiians!  Food at Aloha Kitchen is pretty good, think of it as Hawaiian fast food if you will.  Not the healthiest of menus, but in a crave this place definitely fills a need.  I hope you aren't cutting carbs on this day!  The menu is a mix of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean all rolled into one.  Just like the people of Hawaii!  Chop Suey kine!  Popular are the Chicken Katsu and the Kalua Pig plates, big buggah servings with lots of rice and mac salad!  I like the Teriyaki combo with teriyaki chicken, pork, and beef, and I like the Kalbi combo too with Kalbi ribs, chicken katsu, and teriyaki chicken.  So ono!    The menu is pretty big, there's apps like manapua, egg rolls, shumai, chicken wings, and poke.  Of course there's saimin, and wonton soup, as well as cheeseburgers, teriyaki burgers, and a mahi mahi sandwich as well.  And we can't forget the locals' fav...Spam Musubi!  There's is very good, I usually order 2-one for me and one to share (sharing optional).  There's lots of daily favorites like their teriyaki bowls, fried saimin, Loco Moco (yum), curry, Lau Lau (more yum), tempura, beef stew, and garlic chicken w/gravy just to name a few!  My biggest vice here though?  The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette.  This thing rocks!  I get it everytime I go!  Pork adobo fried with rice and lots of garlic, and put into an omelette.  I would have this thing for breakfast if I didn't for lunch!  I love mine with ketchup and shoyu on top...with a Spam Musubi (or 2)...and a side of kim chee.  Brok' da mouth!  Comfort food for me at it's finest.  Now don't go here expecting gourmet anything, your food will not be served on fine China or be expertly presented.  What you got here is some good no frills eats!  When you hungry this place will do on a budget.  Oh and don't forget the Aloha Bar right next door!  Karaoke contests and cheap drinks galore just about every week.  Although the last time I ate Aloha Kitchen sounded like cats were screaming Aerosmith's 'I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing' next door.  Meow!",

The only downer is how far this place is.  I live in Old Henderson and this restaurant and bar location is on Sahara and Decatur.  No place is far though, when you're on a local food fix!  Last night I had one of those cravings, so I came by to visit everyone at Aloha Kitchen.  I've been to this location many times because of the karaoke bar next door.  Everyone is AH-MAZE-ING.  First off, you're greeted by their bouncer, Greg.  Then you have Shawn at the bar.  Probably the coolest guy you'll ever meet.  Jovane (sorry if I misspelled your name) was the cocktail server and super sweet and Izzy is the KJ.  Very entertaining.  In the restaurant, there's Cyndel who's been a part of Aloha Kitchen for over 10 years.  Everyone's just full of Aloha and treats you like family.  Tonight I got the chicken katsu, spam musubi and the Shanghai lumpia.  The katsu is super crispy and good.  What I really like though, is the katsu sauce. Best katsu sauce I've had.  It's more tangy and savory, rather than sweet.  To me, it compliments the katsu very well.  With the musubi, they add their teriyaki sauce to the spam so it flavors the rice.  Packed with a lot of flavor.  The lumpia is small and filled with pork.  Served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  Super good with a beer next door.    One thing that I could do without is the constant fighting this place has on late nights.  Lately though, there hasn't been any sketchy activities.  All in all, I love visiting this place because of the food and people.  If you're ever in the area, come down and check this place out.",

I dislike white rice, so I had to get a salad as a replacement. (a little bit of an off taste) I believe the teriyaki chicken is still great! Each bite had a crunch with just enough flavor to keep you wanting more. The kalbi and chicken katsu almost seemed like fillers though.  Next time, I will get the chicken teriyaki plate.

    "text": "If you've never been to Aloha Kitchen, you're missing out, my friends. I flippin' love the food here!  I'm gonna get right into it: this place has the best teriyaki chicken in town. I don't care what they say about L&L having good food (it's ok), THIS IS WHERE YOU GO FOR TERI. When you order the chicken teri plate, you get three pieces of chicken, two balls of rice, and a little bit of mac salad. The mac salad here is the best, and I routinely order an additional serving of mac salad because it's so good!  If you've never had kalbi ribs, you need to. I remember the first time I had kalbi ribs, I thought, \"man, these things don't look like what I was expecting...\" and then they blew my mind. I recommend you try the Kalbi Combo, too. It's just so delicious.   Everything here is good. The problem is that since I love the Chicken Teri and Kalbi Combo so much, I usually wind up getting that and not expanding my horizons. I mean, I've had a bunch of other things (katsu!) but I just go back to my favs.   The prices are affordable, too. I was just there and bought two meals, two drinks, and an extra mac salad for $22 even. It's a really good deal when you consider that you get a lot of food for that amount of money, and it's really delicious, too.   The place isn't the most high-end establishment in town. So what? It doesn't pretend to be. Their thing is awesome food at a great price, and they really deliver on that front. I've taken a few people there, and they've become addicts, as well. It's just that good!",

The lady with her bun on too tight who is always behind the counter has always been very short with me. I look the other way because it's decent food, convenient to my home, and open late. But this time Ms. Tight Bun took it too far. She was rude about answering my friends' questions about the menu while we were ordering. Snapped at us twice and never did answer our question about what was in the soup. There were 4 people at the table and they brought 3 meals out. We waited. Then my friend said what he was eating was not what he ordered. He took the plate up to the counter and I asked him to ask about mine too because my food hadn't come. She told my friend he was eating my food and she would get his. The food he had that he had already started eating wasn't what I ordered either. So I took it back up to the counter. She argued with me about what I ordered, slammed the plate down, and said \"you'll just have to wait.\" It was an average night. She wasn't especially busy but it took 30 minutes to get our food we were snapped at while we ordered and then it was wrong and got to deal with her attitude. I really like this place normally but tonight two out of four people left hungry and angry. I'm afraid I won't be able to go back without checking to see how tight her bun is on that day. I feel like I should open the door and toss some Midol in at her to see if it's safe to enter. Wow! You can't treat customers much worse. Take a vacation lady. Come back a happy person please!",

We went and got the spam musubi, kalua pig and cabbage, and the adobo fried rice omlette.  Spam musubi - typical verison. No furukake though.  Kalua pig & cabbage - pretty good for a fast food version of this dish. Savory, sweet pork mixed with the bitterness of the cabbage is a mix that I love. Meat is moist and tender. Something I'd probably order each time.  Adobo fried rice omlette - very flavorful dish. Mmm...good stuff. Everyone else has pretty much covered it, so I don't feel the need to say much.  Overall, service was friendly and punctual, food was good quality, good portion size, especially for the price. I'd definitely hit this place up for breakfast on my next trip to LV.",

I politely went to the counter to clarify my order, but the employee, a young kid, claimed the mahi-mahi plate is cooked with egg. If that is the case, then the menu should clearly state that. Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal.",

Did I mention they take all that and wrap it in a giant omelet? I'm a pretty big guy, who am I kidding I'm fat, but approach the menu with caution. This is where your eyes crave more than your stomach actually has capacity for. Though when is that not the case anyways?! The spam musubi is decent and I've only had a few other things from the menu that looks as big as a Baskin Robbins 31 flavors listing. I've not dared to venture further from what I know here, not because I'm scared but because I only eat here once or twice a month. For those few times a month, I'm already craving the adobo fried rice omelet.   Caution: the omelet is pretty overwhelming 3/4 of the way through. If you've never had it or seen it before, do not be fooled by the name of it if you were to assume it be the size of a standard size omelet. It's the size of a newborn wrapped in an egg.   Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I have!",

    "text": "There are Hawaiian restaurants everywhere in Las Vegas, but this is one of the more \"ono\" spots in my opinion!  * Chicken Katsu - Can never go wrong with deep friend strips of chicken and rice, right? * Adobo Omelet - Scrambled egg wrap around rice mixed with shredded pork adobo.  It's in the shape of a burrito and is pretty huge (although I can easily gulf down one myself!).  I know a lot of people hype this dish up, but to me, it lives up to the hype.  It tastes like home cookin! * Loco Moco - Gotta love hamburger meat smothered in gravy with egg all over?  I've tried many a loco moco and Aloha Kitchen has one of the best I've tried in Vegas (best I'd ever had is in Hawaii). * Oxtail Soup - Delicious and a must try if you can.   * Saimin - A little too salty for me. * Tapsilog - Tapa, egg, and garlic fried rice just like my dad's standard breakfast.  Prices are reasonable and the decor is cute (there's a location on Sunset that is aesthetically nicer) .  My one complaint is that the food can take long sometimes and the service is par.  There were a couple of times we got the wrong order/order never called when eating there and a couple of times we got a cashier who just seemed angry all the time.  This could have been due to the busyness of the place though since it does get pretty crowded late nights.     We frequent the bar next door too.  They have a pretty great song selection, although it can be hard to get on the mic on busy Friday and Saturday nights.  Drinks are normal priced, but the karaoke is free. Have some drinks there then walk over next door immediately after for a complete night out!",

A True must-order if you're in Vegas and worth driving off the strip for. The fried rice is so tasty - not too salty but the perfect marriage of tangy and saltiness. It reminded me of my Mom's adobo and I have yet to find a place who can cook adobo like my Mom. It's pretty big too - think of a 1lb burrito you'd order from a mexican shop only instead of a torilla, it's egg. We also had their SPAM musubi and mixed BBQ plate...can't complain. It was all good. Friendly service, tons of parking, open late...I'm coming back for you Aloha Kitchen! :)",

Now I've tried their katsu several times and I don't really like it so I swap my katsu for teriyaki everytime.  The short ribs are a little pricey if you order an entire dinner of them, so I order this combo so I at least get a taste of them without breaking the bank, but it always leaves me desiring more.  This and the actual wait times that it takes to get your food sometimes is why I ranked them 4 stars instead of 5.",

South Maryland Parkway 3.) East Charleston 4.) West Suset Road  What I do like is the diversity of the menu. The menu consists of a variety of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and American items (yes, there are cheeseburgers!). My favorite dishes from here are the Chicken Katsu, Saimin, Poke and Kalbi Ribs. If you want to try a bit of everything I would recommend the Aloha plate ($8.49) which comes with Chicken Katsu, teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken. The adobo fried rice omelet ($7.69) is also another popular item.   Although it is not listed on their menu they sometimes have an Oxtail Soup which Filipinos call Bulalo. It is really good here and I recommend you ordering it if they offer it.  Today I was able to call in my order and pick it up on my way home from work. I was able to save time and skipped the long line and waiting at the busy restaurant.",

The cook seemed like a Latino man talking under his breath. I noticed the cushions on the seating area torn and the tables a little dirty.   I ordered a bento box and since I don't eat beef asked to substitute the meat for either chicken or more spam. The cashier seemed clueless, and went to the back and asked the cook, not a manager or owner, but the Latino cook.   Reading some of the reviews while waiting for my meal leaves me wondering if this place should be called \"Aloha\" kitchen? Do the cashiers know what Aloha means? I felt a smile and a warm welcome greeting would have been a better touch than questioning me why I was asking if the food here was authentic.  Ok, so I get my meal, take a bite and am surprised. It tastes good. My friend liked his Katsu and the rice was perfect.   Overall, the food is better than most but the service and attitude needs to go! I'm being fair, the food is a 4plus and service a 2.   Foodies; it's a place worth trying, the food taste good!   PS, the teriyaki pork taste like back home in Hawaii.. Nice",

It seems that the cut of meat has changed to a low quality. The steak was these hard little cubes, the rice was over cooked, and my pork was slightly burnt. The portions of meat were very small. The only decent part of the meal was the macaroni salad. Definitely not reminiscent of my visits to other Aloha Kitchens. Don't think I'll order from this location again. Looks like I'll stick with L&L BBQ.",

We recently bought tickets to a show, but wasn't too hungry to have dinner before the show, so we opted to eat after the show gets out. One of my friends looked up late night restaurants on Yelp, and found Aloha Kitchen. When he said that they have Oxtail Soup, I said YES! Oxtail soup is always the right food for late night grindz! The taste is good, but I think it would be better if they had peanuts and Chinese parsley in the soup, like what I'm used to having in my oxtail soup. We had an order of lumpia shanghai too. That also was good. I wanted to try the adobo fried rice, but there was no way the three of us could finish that, plus all that we ordered. Perhaps next time. See you again in our next visit to LV, Aloha Kitchen! \\m/",

I have to say the musubi is probably my favorite thing there. The katsu was crispy and hot, but I probably wouldn't order it again. It lacked flavor. The katsu sauce was weird tasting and the curry sauce was lumpy and had an off taste. The Mac salad was warm and tasted just like mayo. I have had much better Hawaiian food at L&L. I probably won't be back, unless it's for the musubi.",

But the Lumpia was just like a wonton wrapper and 1/2 pork on it. It was good food with reasonable cost.  I'm giving this restaurant three stars because of their bad service. My husband asked the lady behind the counter 3 spoons but the lady just gave her one. Then he asked for a highchair and she just pointed to it like there it is go get it type of an attitude. Lastly when we asked for hand soap in the bathroom as the container was  empty it took them a while to get back to us.  I would definitely come back for the great food but next time I will just take it home with me to avoid all the hassles.",

I bought a Dr. Pepper in the restaurant and was told I couldn't take it in the bar area. The soda had to have a different cup. They didn't have Dr. Pepper on the bar side so I had to choose something else. I mean really I just bought this from you guys. Who cares where I consume it? My friend and I went there for karaoke on a Friday night. BIG MISTAKE! I will never go here again. They Falsely advertise karaoke. We go there at 8p.,m and didn't sing until an hour later. Then we submitted another song and it was not called on until after 11:20p.m. I mean really there were not that many singers. Also other singers got to sing two times in a row, when I waited two hours to sing one other song. I had to drive my friend home and I was tired of waiting. I got home at midnight with one song sang. The DJ whatever you want to call him, talked too much, played too much dance music and had a dance off and a person celebrating their birthday come up and have a sick dance of three women around him. It understand it's his show but fix your website. Say it's karaoke, dancing and partying. My friend told the DJ we were leaving soon and he said he'd move our song up. Well three dance songs later that lasted 10 minutes and another singer he had not called us up yet. So we left. This is Vegas! Why can't there be a good karaoke place without the party? I come to sing not watch a guy air hump and stage and dirty dancing.",

Their fugly manager was asking me to pay for EVERYONE! and of course I said no.  Why would I? I am not Santa Claus and It's not even Christmas yet.   2) After I told her no I can't due to my financial hardship, she asked me to sell my bag that I was carrying with me.  (YOU DON'T FXXXING ASK YOUR CUSTOMER TO SELL THEIR BAG TO PAY FOR YOUR CHICKEN) 3) Then, in front of my boyfriend and everyone, that fugly manager asked me to switch a boyfriend that would pay for everyone, and laughed.  (I WAS LIKE, \"WHY DON'T YOU JUST SERVE YOUR FOOD FOR FREE THEN, BITCH!)  4) I told one of the guys that I will treat him a nice dinner next month because I am financially struggling these days.  And she told my friend to hang up on me if I ever call! (WHAT A BITCH!)  I have never written a review before and I never thought I would ever write a review as horrible as this one.  BUT what I am writing here is the truth, and the truth is powerful.  The personality of the  manager at ALOHA KITCHEN is as hideous as her appearance.  Even though I was extremely disappointed and angered by her HORRIBLE service, now I pity her because she is just OH SO!! hideous inside and out.    SO!!! whenever any of you (who are reading this review) ever sees that fugly manager, you better be a BALLER and pay for EVERYONE you are with OR ELSE she will embarrass you to the MAX in front of everybody.  GREAT JOB to the MANAGER at ALOHA KITCHEN! I will definitely spread the \"GOOD WORDS\"  :D",

    "text": "Forget the 2 hour wait at Bacchanal, what more could you ask for from Filipino/Hawaiian fusion. Unfortunately, my favorite Vegas day club had a wait time that did not fit within the time constraints of my day. My sister and cousin, mentioned Aloha Kitchen and I've always been wanting to try it, so why not that day.  It's about 10-15 minutes from The Strip and especially for Out of Towners, it's worth the drive. The menu is more Hawaiian with a Filipino twist. The BF and I ended up trying 4 dishes: the Loco Moco, the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet, the Kalua Pig and the Banana Macadamia Pancakes. Not sure if it was the hunger, but everything tasted amazing.  The Adobo Friend Rice Omelet did NOT disappoint. I did wish the omelet was a bit thicker because I LOVE eggs, nonetheless the flavor was on great. I did feel that it was a little TOO salty, but the BF, my sister and cousin disagreed.   Everyone talks about the pancakes and now I know why. The pancakes are fluffy and soft and you really can taste the subtle flavor of the banana and the macadamia nuts perfectly topped it off.   For all 4 dishes we paid half the price of one person at a buffet on The Strip. We enjoyed the food and got full.",

I always see relatives of mine check in here on FB and it made me curious after seeing the yelp reviews and photos and menu. I brought my parents along with me and my son of course.  After my first visit, it's probably now my favorite place to eat when I come out now. My parents said the same thing. They said they are probably only going to come and eat there now when they come to Vegas. I got the adobo omelette which was so amazing and so ridiculously huge, my mom got longanisa, my dad got hashbrowns and eggs, and for my son, who is insanely picky, i got the kids teriyaki plate, which he surprisingly ate and I finished of course. I ate off of everyone's plate and everything I had was so good. I would post photos but my phone is not allowing me to right now for some reason. All of that food we ordered for about 30 something dollars. Totally worth it. My mouth waters thinking about eating here again. I wish they had locations in LA or the valley!",

Spam musubi and mac salad are my favorite items on the menu and their Loco Moco is pretty legit. Prices are fairly affordable for how much food you get.

Paid $24 for 6 buds (bucket) and $9 for mixed drinks. Thats where the word 'Pre-game' comes in heh. I find it interesting to drink and watch people dance, that is until im forced to join them.. alcohol is not the greatest friend. :{ Its pretty unique to see a restaurant attached to the karaoke bar. Prices are cheaper than i thought, plus quantity and quality paid out as well. Pretty convenient so everyone can sober up with some carbs before the trip home. Dont worry, its a whole seperate room so you dont have to hear the wonderful intoxicated singers.   Cant throw my 5th star just for the fact that i was standing most of my time in the bar area. I recommend a UYE for this joint soon. Who wants to sing?!",

I was 3/4th done with my meal, so I suppose there was no point in complaining about it. And it's an Asian (Filipino) establishment. I know I won't get much sympathy from the owners.. So instead here I am venting about it on yelp.  This is the first I've experienced something like this from Aloha kitchen..Sooo disappointing. If I do come back, I'll make sure to check my food ahead of time from now on for foreign objects.",

Im not a fan of overly sticky/mushy rice so I just ate it with the MacSalad. Pretty goood.  Tastes identical to the grilled chicken plates from Chinese fusion cafes.  Besides that i give them props for The hours theyre open, and the promptness of the food. Not a place id crave.",

    "text": "I had AWESOME food catered from Aloha Kitchen for my wedding reception (which was at Jackpot Bar and Grill, another place owned by the same owner, Liza).   A little background: my now-husband and I live in California but we got married at the MGM, so we had to plan everything from a distance. I did some Yelping and found Aloha Kitchen, and made an appointment to meet Liza a few months in advance. Liza and Myla, the front of house manager, met us at Aloha Kitchen, gave us an amazing tasting menu of Hawaiian food, and were incredibly friendly.   For our reception, we ordered: Kalua Pork Vegetarian Egg Rolls Kalbi BBQ Pork Stir-fried Vegetables  Korean Street Tacos (from the Jackpot Bar & Grill menu) Rice  ALL of the food exceeded expectations and was super ONO (Delicious)!  I'm from Hawaii, and it was a dream come True having authentic Hawaiian food for my wedding reception :-D",

I always go for the spam musubi I grew up eating them in l.a.  and it takes me back every time.   You'll always get good service too, food is made timely.

It's saimin with won-tons in it, hence the name WON- TON MIN.  My uncle ordered pork adobo... taste like crap.

Now its very hard to replicate flavors of things you have had . Now don't get me wrong there food was decent but I've  been to Hawaii and I have had plenty of the same dishes this place serves up. I will definitely give them  credit for effort on certain dishes. Let me start by saying Banana Mac nut pancakes are pretty good. The Korean BBQ was good it had nice flavors and a pretty good serving . Now the Tapa wasn't all that great they use a thinly slice meat like you would use for cheesesteaks and flavor wise there wasn't any. The Spam musubi had way too much rice and also lacked that extra sauce on the rice to give it that extra punch.  The Macaroni salad was missing something I fell flat on flavor( maybe it was the Mayo). I would come back but maybe try something else.",

Very disappointed because we brought a large group of family to eat after a family viewing and the person who recommended Aloha Kitchen was sorry he did. We are islanders and we know that islanders are always so warm and welcoming but this place was run by young people so I can see where the lack of respect comes from. Food was ok, it did the job, but nothing extra ordinary from what we are used to. Definitely not worth going back even if the good were excellent I still wouldn't go back just because we are big on customer service and it sucked sadly. Management needs to train their millennials that us seasoned people (40 and up club) frown on lack of respect. Teach them how to handle customers and their concerns. We brought a group of 25 and sadly one bad experience is enough to not have us go back.",

My usual order is the student special, which is just a bowl of teriyaki chicken and Japanese sticky rice and a drink for just $6.05 (including tax)! I also love getting the $1 turon (banana egg roll). The Teriyaki Combo (teriyaki chicken, pork, and beef with rice and macaroni salad) is also delicious. The tapsilog (rice with sunny side up egg and beef) doesn't really taste like legit tapa (beef). The spam musubi is something you can easily make one at home. You can order better eggroll at an actual Filipino restaurant, but it's nice that they offer it. The Saimin Soup is kind of salty. There is also a karaoke bar adjacent to the restaurant, which I have been meaning to check out.  This place is good for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or after a night out partying!",

Teriyaki chicken was horrible and so was the garlic chicken. A family member got the kalua pig and cabbage said it wasn't bad. So far the worst Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas will not be returning.  They also brib you to give them a good review on here in exchange for free egg rolls...  P.s. I'm from hawaii I know how Hawaiian food is made and taste and this was not it at all. If you want some good Hawaiian food your better off going to L&L or so far the best I've been to is 808 Mix Plate",

ATMOSPHERE  - When we came...atmosphere is nice...wasn't too busy and the dining room was clean....(but they got really really busy when we sat down...the rush came in...)  CLEANLINESS  - the place is clean..except the coffee station was kind of messy.  CUSTOMER SERVICE ..they are still polite and friendly   PRICES - the prices are reasonable for what ur getting...however I am extremely picky abt my Hawaiian food...  FOOD- So let's to get to the main reason why I came.....The food kinda went down from what I remember... prices are good......but the food aww man...small kine not too good this round..   The breakfast plate- Portuguese sausage eggs and rice...First the rice was mushy..the eggs should have been scrambled with cheese so they made it into an omelet looking style and put a regular American cheese slice..really?! The Portuguese sausage did not taste like Portuguese sausage.. it didn't have that chili pepper saltiness to it like a Portuguese sausage should have..call me picky but I know my sausages  My husband has a Bento box ...mushy rice the spam was thick and not all the way cooked and the teriyaki sauce that was on the meat kind of tastes like it was from a can... The only thing that was actually good..was the  chicken skewers..but they were a little raw looking...  I had to give 2 stars (my husband didnt feel they deservd that...) ...but i dont feel they no longer represent the True Hawaiian style food ...almost cutting corners.. ...",

KJ not aware of standard queue protocols and what songs are in the library. The bartender would rather argue about a drink and try to intimidate a customer than own his mistakes. The upside is that the staff should turn over in a few months (if their trend keeps up). Maybe we'll try again then. Toilet handle broken. Bathroom dirty.   Long version: This used to be a fun karaoke place. Their main host has changed, and they have struggled to find a replacement. Everyone in here was new the last time that we went, which isn't too surprising because it seemed every few months there was a different team there.   The customer service is horrible. I asked for a Black Label with a splash of soda and was given Black Label and tonic. I walked to the bar and let the waitress know as she is swamped and has the entire room. She apologized and let the bartender know. He comes to me and says, \"I put soda in there.\" Then he holds up the store brand bottle they got at a grocery store and shakes it in my face. I told him, \"If you're not convinced, taste the drink. It's tonic and not what I ordered.\" He stares and me. I don't blink. He grabs the glass and throws it in the sink and says, \"Fine.\" Then he gets a cup and brings the soda bottle and says, \"This says soda.\" He pours it in a cup and asked me to taste it. I tell him that it is soda. He then says, \"Good. I don't want to waste this stuff (holding the Scotch bottle). It's not cheap.\" He proceeds to make me a scotch and soda, which isn't what I ordered. I just didn't care anymore.   I sit down in the booth. The host comes to me and says, \"We don't have this song.\" I tell her, \"Yes, you do. I've sang it here before.\" She comes back and tells me that she found it. When it's finally my fiance's turn, she plays the wrong song. He tries to help her find the right one because he has sang it there before. Finally, he tells her that he'll give her a different song, so she bumps him to the bottom of the queue! How? This is your mistake, and he gets punished for your incompetence. After 7 songs, I get up to ask when he is going. She says, \"Soon enough.\" I told her, \"I needed a specific number of turns because you put him at the bottom for your mistake.\" She glared at me and said, \"Three.\" I told her, \"Thank you.\"  Bathroom was dirty. Toilet hand was broken. Only one bathroom now. No one cares.",

I went to fill our cups and the beverage dispenser seemed to be broken...not out of something, but actually broken. It sprayed me with fruit punch which seemed to set the tone for our meal.   When I got in the bathroom to wash my hands, the bleach smell was overpowering. It was so strong it made my eyes water, and even though I knew bleach had been used, it felt really grimy. Of course there were no paper towels.   When our order finally came out, the lumpia were nice and hot and crispy. They were the high point of the meal. The beef bowl was smothered in sauce, it didn't taste like any teriyaki sauce I've ever had..almost like a burned gravy. It was disappointing because the beef itself had a good texture, no gristle or fatty globs.   My husband's chicken was really unappetizing - it honestly looked like a slab of meat from a frozen dinner and he said it was rubbery. He described his beef as being \"well done and then some.\" Not a fan.   There are too many good Hawaiian places in this town to settle for mediocrity, and that's definitely where this place ranked for me. The staff was friendly, and the dining area was clean, but the cons definitely outweighed the pros here.",

Yummers!!!  Honestly I was so excited that they had the karioka that I inhaled them first and even went back later that night to buy two more after I went out to dinner!  I wasn't crazy about the Mac salad, which was disappointing because a good Mac salad is a great compliment to an excellent local plate.  There was some kind of funny after taste to it.  Perhaps it was a bad batch of mayo or something but hopefully next time I dine there, they can rectify that.  Also was disappointed that although they had Pepsi products, they did not carry Mountain Dew, my vice, lol.  I may sound nit-picky but believe it or not, I've chosen Pepsi product restaurants over Coca-Cola establishments simply because of the beverage choices.  I will be spending the month of March in Vegas so expect me to be a frequent customer here!  So ono!!!",

My experience didn't live up to what I'd expected, but it wasn't awful either.  Service was great, staff are friendly. Restaurant is clean. Didn't experience the bar. Opted for the Local's Plate (beef and chicken teriyaki, two musubi, sides of rice and mac salad) plus a lumpia app. I'm not the hugest fan of teriyaki and this was not one I would necessarily come back for, spam on musubi was thinner and less flavorful than what I've had at L&L, I preferred the lumpia I've had at actual Filipino places, and I'm generally not a fan of mac salad in the first place because of my aversion to mayo. The dishes weren't bad, they were just a little lacking in flavor and not the punch of flavor I'd expected.   Would come back to try other dishes suggested: oxtail soup, adobo fried rice omelet, manapua, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.",

    "text": "Last week - I dropped by the Aloha Kitchen and Bar for lunch. Had high hopes that this would be a location that would come close to being like the food I love and miss when I'm back home on the islands. However - I've learned to live with disappointment in life and my visit here was just another added to that list.   The dining area is nice - somewhat clean, open and modern(ish) compared to other \"local\" style restaurants I've been to. The names of the dishes were promising and the prices seemed in line with the portion sizes I had seen on people's tables as I waited to place my order.   I was coming down with a cold so I wanted saimin - even with it being in the 90's and humid which they don't serve. A Hawaiian style restaurant that doesn't serve saimin - odd. Even fast food joints in Hawaii serve saimin.  At least they serve fried saimin. So, I settled for that.   Too much vegetables which normally isn't a bad thing however, after a few bites, I started to separate the cabbage and celery. Sorted thru and picked out the minced meat and noodles and with the leftover vegetables, it looked like I hadn't made a dent in the plate. I also chose a side of macaroni salad. Ugh.   All I'm going to say is that I have to wonder if the cooks have ever been to the islands. Either that or the cooks have started tayloring their dishes to the tastes of people who haven't been either. Or maybe, I didn't choose the right dishes that they specialize in ... whatever the case, I didn't like what I ordered and I doubt I'll be back any time soon.",

I used to ditch to here actually lol. 80% of the time you'll see people order the student special which is about $5. It comes this chicken teriyaki, rice, and a soda. My personal fave if I'm super hungry is the kalbi combo or just the kalbi plate. The combo comes with kalbi, chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, rice, and your choice of mac salad or Kim chee. The kalbi is fricken to die for its so tender and flavorful! I swear I could just sit and eat and eat and eat these ribs lol. You can also order them for catering! It's $40 to feed 15ppl and $90 to feed 30ppl.   I have seen this place go through so many decorative renovations and I think the current decor is my favorite. They moved the drink station away from the order counter so it helps traffic TREMENDOUSLY!  OH and don't forget your ID they ALWAYS check it :)",

Not too bad...I'm afraid I might have been a bit too intoxicated to really provide a very detailed review, but here's what I remember:   Drinks:   Kind of expensive...$28 for 2 beers, and 3 well shots.   Karaoke:  fun...but the KJ had a pretty sizable queue, and sang 2 songs himself within about 7 minutes of each other.  As a KJ at other venues myself...you don't do that.  You don't sing in the queue unless you have less than 8 people singing.   Also, there is a sign on the KJ booth that says \"2 drink minimum.\"   WHAT?  I know most people like to drink before singing, but what if your DD wants to sing?  Is it 2 drinks for the whole party?  Per person?  I don't get it...  Staff:  awesome.  When they were closing down, my friend and I were waiting for our very drunken men to finish in the bathroom.  The staff didn't know this, and came over and said they were closing...when we said we were waiting on the boys, they started joking around with us about \"what are they doing in there?\" (to which my very clever friend said \"Hopefully not sword fighting.\")  They were gracious, and very nice.    I'd come back and give it another go...I'd like to find out more about the drink minimum for karaoke...",

I love that they're open late; the menu is very reasonably priced. The kalbi bbq is out of this worrrrlldddd, I am obsessed with how it's marinated. I like the chicken katsu as well, and the banana pancakes are a really nice finishing touch if you like dessert. I only knocked it down a star because I don't prefer the katsu curry style here, it's like they give you a side of stew with potatoes and carrots to pour over katsu. I personally prefer L&L's style of katsu curry when it comes to that. Still love everything else though!",

The chicken katsu was good but the adobo was SALTY.  By the time I got to the adobo, I ran out of rice. And the only other rice I had at home was the boil-in-a-bag rice that I buy just for my dog. So I decided to save the adobo for the next day and make a sandwich out of it. I've had their chicken curry in the past and I remembered it as being quite good.

Came here yesterday... my 2 favorite local spots are closed on Sundays... and I wanted to take my friend who was visiting from San Diego to a cool Hawaiian spot... and Aloha Kitchen seems to be one of the few Hawaiian spots open on Sundays! (I'll give them a star just for being open on Sundays!)  I was kind of iffy on trying Aloha Kitchen due to the reviews... But one of my friends from Hawaii Richmond works the bar here and he mentioned that was food was great so I figure why not try it out for myself :))  I ordered the Hawaiian plate, with all rice (I substituted mac salad with rice), kalua pig and laulau. It was yummy! I had to get a can of Hawaiian sun :) My friend ordered the spam and eggs.  I wasn't disappointed with my Hawaiian plate. If I closed my eyes, I could picture myself eating Hawaiian food at my grandma's house on the Big Island.  Okay prices... Order came out pretty fast. Meal for 2... $20. Casual indoor seating.  If I'm craving Hawaiian food on Sundays... Aloha Kitchen will be my go to hot spot.  Mahalo Aloha Kitchen for my 15 minute vacation back home to Hawaii...! Now to work off the 1 pound I gained.  I'll be back, when I get my cravings :D  If you're in the area... stop by Aloha Kitchen! and if you're at the bar... and Richmond is working... tell him I sent you!  Aloha!  -Miss Yelp 2011",

But go inside and the menu makes you feel like you've landed in a slice of Honolulu.  Teriyaki beef and chicken plate lunch, spam musubi, loco moco and macaroni salad.  Unless you've grown up with it you don't really appreciate how good it is here--better than a lot of places in Hawaii.  Order at the counter, sit at one of the linolium booths and they will bring the food to you when it's ready.  Reasonably priced, friendly service and good portions.  It's not the healthiest stuff but it fills the urge and you won't find anything like for miles around.",

I asked if they can cook the cabbage and they said NO as if it's illegal or something. Last time we're coming to this joint because they won't honor a simple request such as grilled cabbage. Forget this place, Go to L&L instead! Peace",

The boy and I were looking for a place to stop at on our way home from Chinese New Year, and decided to stop here, never having tried a hawaiian place before.. Which aparently, is an awful lot like Japanese? I guess? But with pineapples? Anyways, the boy got a teriyaki chicken bowl for under $4, and I got the garlic chicken with gravy for $7. Mine came with macaroni salad, which was meh. No real flavor at all to it. I'd probably just skip that part next time. But the garlic chicken was sooo so good, and the portion size was massive, 3 pieces of chicken and two rice scoops. I had to take half home.  The boy liked his teriyaki chicken bowl as well. Not as much food as the garlic chicken, but still more than enough. The teriyaki sauce had a nice pineapple tang to it, and the chicken was super tender.",

When I walked in, I was happy to discover that Oxtail Soup is a winter special. It was a no-brainer and I certainly enjoyed it. The oxtail was a little tough and fatty, but the broth had good flavor. Then again, I'm not that picky. Overall, I think the Oxtail Soup at Market Street and even Island Flavor is better, but this one satisfied just fine.  Glad to see Aloha Kitchen is still worth visiting.",

They are kind and cool. The place is not flashy, posh, trendy, nor is it dirty, dank, greasy. Enlightenment is in the middle road. And this place hits the middle gracefully. Drinks are generous. Service is sweet. Karaoke is fun. Try the Kalua pig and katsu combo plate. Most everything I tried here is delicious. They will bring your food to you in the bar. There is video poker, karaoke, roasted pig, deep drinks, fresh rice, cold beer, hot katsu, and kind company here. Prepare to park it for hours here. Have fun and don't be shy.",

When our order came the chicken Katsu was obviously burnt hence the darkness of the coating. When my daughter-in-law took it back they told her \"it's because of the oil\" she ask for a refund they offered her to exchange. She declined. The cook remembered her when she returned a plate of chicken katsu that was still pink inside. Proceeded to tell the cashier if they  refund her she will no longer be serviced there.  Once I ordered a dish when it came I advised the cashier it wasn't what I ordered and she stood there disagreeing with me. She wouldn't correct my order. Very sad customer service.",

I almost never order an omelette, because it brings to mind the dull, thick, multiple egg dishes at diners. Luckily my lady friend had heard of it before, at this place, and ordered it. I ended up ordering the combo plate with chicken adobo, katsu, and rice. It was good, and a plentiful portion. As soon as they brought her plate to to the table, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. It looked and smelled delicious, and when I took a sample bite, it was even better! The egg is cooked thinly with lots of chopped green onion in it. For lack of a better term, Chinese style. The fried rice wrapped inside is great, not as greasy as I had been expecting. Even writing this now, I want some! They have plenty of other stuff on the menu from lumpia to musubi to saimin. I'm sure there are other good things, but next time I'm in town, I know exactly what I'm ordering.",

The fried saimin (noodles with pork and green onion and stuff) was so delicious I tried super hard to finish it but just couldn't.  My companions had some good stuff too -- pork adobo was good and portioned as if the whole pig was used; chicken katsu was light and tasty.  It was just a short cab ride from the strip (it's near the northern end of the strip, off sahara blvd).",
