I looked, deadpaned and just said \"DUH! Wolfgang Puck\". Service was great, our server giving us suggestions on not just the food, but specialty drinks as well. I didn't do much talking,  i was just enjoying my food. The BEST butternut squash soup EVER!",

My husband and I came here for lunch before we headed to the airport and were seated right away; the hostess and server were very nice and friendly from arrival to departure.  We also liked the food here a lot, we had steamed mussels as appetizer, the sausages in the mussels were very tasty and mussels were perfectly cooked,  just the sizes were kind of small. I also had their special fish of the day, it was very tender and flavorful. Husband ordered their Beef Carpaccio and Steak Tartar and he liked it so much that he finished the everything in 5min.  We also ordered some of their red wine, I can't remember the name of it but it was recommended by the server; it was very smooth and flavorful, I wish we have more time to hang out there and try more food and wine.  We'll be back!",

Took a long time to get our check as well. Overall we got bad dining experience. Not going back!!",

While I personally did not order a drink, two of my companions ordered the bloody Mary which one said was the best that he had ever had.  For my entree I decided upon the spicy pepperoni pizza.  I was also lucky enough to try both the Italian and the eggplant pizzas.  All were good but I really loved the combination of ricotta, pepperoni and spicy peppers that were on the spicy pepperoni.   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  All of the pizzas were tasty but be prepared to pay over $15 for a 9 inch pie.",

From the minute we entered we had the BEST service staff...friendly, courteous and very attentive. So...the food?  We tried several apps off the menu which were better than as described on the menu...came out very timely and served with class.  My party also tried one of their pizzas...with a little extra KICK of heat...WOW  it was oven hot..spiced just right..crust was cooked to GBD!.  My party split entree orders to some off the menu and some ordered the Chef's Specials.  My meal was a special and put together beautifully...the ingredients were delicious together...lamb sausage, fennel and broccoli rabe all served over pasta. The portion was not skimpy yet not overboard.  When I looked around the table there was hardly any food remaining on the plates that appeared to not need washing! The steak was perfect as well as the fettuccine dish. BRAVO to the Chef!  Regarding the dessert....their house-made Gelato sampler was to die for......But... Their zeppoles were the BOMB.  Now, Im originally from NJ where zeppoles are a staple at just about every pop up carnival, church function and San Gennaro festival..not to mention the shore areas. These were the best I had in all my xx years.  They were hot, not dense and sugared to perfection. I recommend the Raspberry dipping sauce which was out of this world...if only they jarred it for sale!  I would certainly visit this restaurant often...moderately priced, upscale atmosphere and great food and service. Cant ask for anything more!",

The stars of the show are their prosciutto pizza and their garlic bread. Both were delicious and a notch above what they normally would taste like at other restaurants. Where it didn't meet my expectations, was the soppressata pizza, the caprese appetizer, and the spaghetti with meatballs. All three were average and not worth eating again.   The decor and atmosphere are nice and would definitely be a nice place for a celebration dinner. Prices are $20-$30 for most entrees except the steaks, which are $40-$50.",

I looked at the menu to review what I had, but I don't even know the name of the starter I ordered. Well, the menu doesn't really go by a \"name\" instead they just list out what the dishes are, which is kinda nice for the non-bilingual.  For the starter.. It was just a pile of mozzarella with what looked like uncooked bacon with green seasoning ontop. Wasn't really a fan of the fatty meat, but the cheese was good all on its own.  Now for my meal. The Panini: Mozzarella, Basil Pesto, Insalata Mista, Creamy Tomato Soup - I had NO idea what Insalata Mista was, but apparently it's a salad. It was so YUMMY! I thought the prices of these would be outrageous but I was completely wrong. My Panini was a reasonable $16.   The staff was so kind, and the place is gorgeous. There's not one thing I can complain about... Here's a 5!",

I ordered braised baby artichoke, white sangria and passion fruit Cosmo from happy hour menu, and Steamed Mussels, Chorizo, Marjoram, Grilled Ciabatta from regular menu, bf ordered soup of the day and Linguine, Steamed Clams, White Wine-Garlic Sauce, they offer complimentary bread too.   I liked my food a lot, they were very delicious and flavored, the sausages in my steamed mussels are particularly good,  just one problem, they were very very salty! Glad we were a little hangover, so we could finish the extremely salty dishes there.   I wouldn't go there for dinner, just a casual lunch after a little bit too much drinking the previous night. the portions are so big, even good for sharing. the price is not cheap, our tab was around $78. A little more for a casual lunch , but its Vegas and its at Crystals. SO... :P",

    "text": "After our amazing meal at Puck's Bar and Grill at MGM, all we could do was lament that we hadn't discovered it sooner. Now we had family in town (who wouldn't be interested) followed by extended travel, when all we really wanted to do was go notch every Puck eatery that we'd ignored all these years on the grounds of Puck-the-man coming off as a bit of a wanker on TV. Cruel fate!  But one night mercy struck: our guests were occupied and we were hungry. Okay, where could we go quickly and casually? We bolted for the Pizzeria.  First came the bread. Not a delicate basket but a sliced mini-loaf with butter. Golden and crusty outside, golden and fragrant inside with flecks of herbs and some decent-sized holes in an otherwise tight crumb. (You can tell I've been reading bread cookbooks.) \"Quite tasty.\"  Mike, his stomach keeping in mind our relocation from Vegas in the too-near future, ordered a starter of grilled meatballs, and we both got the butter leaf salad with Gorgonzola, hazelnuts, and egg. (Mike's with the customary bacon, mine without.)  Thumbs up from Mike on the meatbals. I liked my salad better than the Greek-ish one at the Bar and Grill - fewer ingredients kept the flavours from being lost, perhaps. Still, I've had more interesting and tastier salads at so many other places around town that this is part of the reason Puck loses a star here. As much as I love a good salad course, I wouldn't bother with one next time. Perhaps if you're not a vegetarian you don't feel so \"meh\" about what he offers. (That said, Mike liked the salad well enough but agreed it wasn't anything special.)  We each got our own pizza (partially because of our different preferences, partially because we were already excited by the idea of having some Puckian leftovers for the next day). Choosing what to get, though, was so hard. As a vegetarian, usually I have to pick between \"variety of vegetables that will always include something icky,\" \"variety of cheeses,\" and \"Margherita.\" Here I could have Margherita, but I could also have \"mushroom with bechamel, fontina, arugula, and thyme.\" Or I could have \"eggplant with crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and oregano.\" Or maybe I could try \"Yukon Gold potato with mascarpone, Brussel sprouts, and rosemary, hold the guanciale.\" I hate Brussel sprouts and yet it still sounded good!  In the end I chose the \"caramelized onion pizza with creme fraiche, arugula, and olives.\" Mike had the Italian meat, I think. Something with pepperoni, anyway. I don't recall because my pizza was So Darn Delicious that all other pizzas discontinued to exist. Oh, that fluffy, chewy, soft thoroughly cooked crust! (If you like it thin-and-floppy, this isn't your place.) The near-buttery onions that melted on my tongue without being greasy. The fresh little pops of the arugula. And the olives, so discreetly flavourful without being unpleasantly bitter. How would I ever be able to face little black rings from a chain pizzeria again?  The customers at the table next to us claimed no room for dessert, and I felt so sorry for them. People, this may have been only my second Puck experience, but even I knew you have to wear your eating britches and pace yourself because skipping dessert is just going to make the Baby Julia Child cry. But I understood their plight because pushing away that pizza when I was still hungry took previously untested levels of will power.   Our dessert choice wasn't on the online menu; we shared a piece of chocolate concoction that was like dark chocolate cake on the bottom and dense/creamy chocolate pie on top, with a nutty edge and served with cream. \"Mmmm.\" \"Mmmm.\" \"Mmmm.\" \"MMMmmm.\" Dinner conversation became a bit stilted for awhile.  Service was great; our waitstaff team of two was happy to answer questions and soda refills were timely. The seating didn't feel too crowded, even though the place was full and therefore we had to sit at a two-top. It would have been nicer if the tables for two were a little further apart (there goes the rest of that star), although I know my cultural need for that much personal space isn't universal. (But should I have been so aware about one table's decision not to have dessert, and another table's decision to have the same salad we did?) Still, not a dealbreaker.  And of course, the best part was driving home with our pizzas in the backseat. We couldn't wait to be hungry again!",

These mushrooms lacked all of that woodsy-dirt flavor usually accompanying my bad habit.  The buttery umami mushrooms were adorned with slightly bitter, yet still crisp, dark green arugula leaves, which rested atop a gossamer glaze of bechamel and shiny fontana cheese. Lightly salted, when dunked in a sweet side of red sauce, you're mouth is in for the most psychedelic flavor trip of its life.",

It was a late Saturday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't full. There seemed to be plenty of support staff and chefs and cooks in the kitchen. With so many people, I was expecting prompt service but I was so wrong.   Paid $11 for the most basic Moscow mule I've ever had. My friend and I could determine the lack of ginger taste is because they didn't use ginger beer - more like ginger ale. The salami plate was probably the shimmering highlight of the meal but it came 20 minutes after we were given our drinks. How long does it take to slice up some salami and put it on a cutting board? My friend ordered an extremely basic balsamic dressed insalata. We both agreed that we could make better attempts at home.   For our mains, we both got the cacio e pepe. Which we delivered another 20 minutes after the antipasti. We were both expecting a buttery and cheesy masterpiece. It was not. It needed more seasoning and was not hot and steaming as I would like for it to be.   I'm sad that Yelp reviews didn't away me to love this place.  I'll be looking towards other Italian places next time in Vegas.",

The pizza finally came and was the best thing we had.  It took well over an hour.    There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to put up with bad service and so so food.

No problem when we showed up with 9, they pulled over and extra table which gave some extra elbow room. They adjusted the place settings right away. Drinks were well made from iced tea to Sangria to martinis! I am big on glasses being refilled and our bus-person was on point! He was courteous but quiet and bothered no one. Our waiter was amazing, kind and very apologetic when they missed our order of ravioli. The manager and waiter did whatever they could to make it right. We shared pizza and salads, clams and linguini, pork chops and pesto, chicken and braised short ribs. Calamari was perfectly cooked. Whatever you order you will not be disappointed. Food was delicious....great job staff! We will be back to see you again.  Oh with meals & drinks but no appetizers or desserts price came to less than $40 per person before tips. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Came to grab a late lunch to-go on a Monday, June 11, 2012.  I was warmly greeted at the door by the hostess and manager.  I asked if I could get an order to go, and they said I could at the bar.  I didn't take pics, so my memory is a bit elusive... but I remember it being very well-lit, and modern.  It matched the space of the Crystals shopping center.  It was very lively, and I was surprised there were so many patrons at that hour (around 2pm).  I got the spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the grilled meatballs.  My friend, Arvin T, had been searching for the \"best meatball,\" and so I joined him in his search.  I was very tempted to have a cocktail, having glanced a number of tasty looking handcrafted cocktails... next time!  I forget how long the bartender said the wait would be, and I had made a note in my phone (only to have deleted it, it seems)... but I remember it taking 3-4 minutes longer than he said.  Which was fine for me, but for those that are nit-picky...  Fast forward, I'm sitting on the couch in Veer Towers (that's why I chose to get it to go -- it was 8 minutes flat, from bar to doorstep), with Mad Men on Netflix... I dig into the spaghetti... it's cooked al dente, thumbs up.  I take a bite of the meatball -- my teeth sink through more easily than anticipated; it's a very soft texture, and I don't like it.  On top of that, it was surprisingly sweet tasting, not in a good way.  Disappointed, I wash it down with water, and give it a second go.  Same disappointment.  I open up the grilled meatballs and cross my fingers... The texture is more firm, like I'm used to.  However, this time it's way too salty!  I quickly grab the water, rinse, and repeat.  Salty!  Deja Vu.  Einstein's attributed quote came to mind: \"Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"  (He didn't really say that btw, but who knows who came up with it).  When my friend came home from work that day, I had saved him well over half (probably 3/4).  He tried it, and disagreed with me about the grilled meatballs being salty... only to recant his statement 4 hours later when he admitted he needed to drink lots of water at dinner.  Wolfgang Puck, your meatballs let me down that day.  But, being as sleek looking as you were, I will return to sample your handcrafted cocktails anyway ;)",

This place is more suited for lunch time or quick bites.  I had a 3 meat pizza, my wife had eggplant parmesan.   The pizza was ok, took the waiters advice and subbed one meat for sausage. Great call... but I'd have loved some, any, cheese. It lacked the sweet flavor that cheese gives which makes pizza so enjoyable.   My wife said her dish was good. I don't care for eggplant so I passed testing it.  Dessert, my wife got gelati and I got zeppolas. Gelati is always good, the zeppolas had no flavor.  The best saving grace here is the staff. They are fast, friendly, and very efficient. Bravo!",

They offer all day happy hour at the bar, but we opted for a table to try their menu.   Bruschetta (Special of the Day) - It comes with 3 pieces of bread, drizzled with balsamic and pesto, topped with cherry tomatoes, cheese, and greens.  Great way to start the meal!  The pesto was a nice touch to make it unique.  It's crunchy, a little acidic, fresh, and sweet.  Frito Misto - Fried calamari, shrimp, cauliflower, shishito peppes, onions, and slices of lemon.  My favorite dish that we had that day.  Everything is lightly coated and fried to perfection.  The two aioli that comes with it is a chili aioli (orange colored) and a lemon aioli (white colored).  Both pair beautifully with everything.    Fettucini Carbonara - The noodles are made in house.  You can order either a half or full order of pasta.  We got a full order and the server brought it out in two plates so we can share, which was very nice of him.  The fettucini comes with pancetta and zucchini with a light cream sauce.  Half an order is a good amount for one person!   I had a great experience during lunch!  The food was really good, everything is reasonably priced, and our server was spot on with his recommendations and service.  Definitely excited to go back and try other things on the menu!",

I can't remember having a better server in my whole life, I am serious, Paul killed it! He is a very friendly person. We had a really nice discussion about wine and beer - he is quite knowledgeable about the latter. He brought multiple samples so we could easily decide on what we liked best. During our lunch he was always there to tend our needs and make sure nothing was missing.  The food was excellent. I went with the bruschetta as the appetizer and I loved them. The tomatoes were fresh, properly prepared (seeds removed) and very well seasoned. The dish featured a freshly made basil pesto that lifted the dish to a whole different level.   Paul told us that their pizza was baked in a wood fire oven, so the decision for the main dish was pretty simple for me. A very appealing thing was that their oven has a window on the restaurant side and you can see how your pizza is being baked - a really nice touch! I went for the Prosciutto pizza and I do not regret it. The taste was astonishing. All the ingredients were fresh and and you could really taste the smokiness of the wood.  Everything was fine tuned for a perfect experience. When I'm back in Vegas this is a spot I will definitely revisit. Thank you for the wonderful experience! I had the time of my life.",

    "text": "Really unacceptable service at this Wolfgang Puck location.  It's just disappointing to see how this management's location has completely disrespected the good name of Wolfgang Puck.  This is Las Vegas with far too many other restaurant choices to choose from.  Had to ask about my husband's drink twice.  Other tables who were seated after us received their food before us.  The kitchen being \"suddenly\" backed up because a rush of unexpected large parties is no excuse.  But having to ask for our food twice is a sign of very bad back kitchen management and shows a lack of leadership and communication between the back and front of the house.  I could sense that the server was just as frustrated with the kitchen as we were.  As for the food, it was fine.  The pizzas are standard Puck issue (the crust of my margherita not being charred enough imo) and the spaghetti and meatballs does not compare to Rao's or Scarpetta's (is their service for that matter).    The server did offer us a free dessert but we declined and instead issued a free drink for my husband's late arrival.  The only plus, my husband and I were able to walk in here without a reservation -- but now I understand why.",

We got:  Parpadelle - flavorful and delicious, meaty marinara sauce with thick and chewy noodles. 5/5  Prosciutto pizza - my favorite type of pizza did not disappoint! They could've been a bit more generous with the arugula though!  Italian fennel sausage pizza - great as well! The broccolini was a great addition:  The crust on both pizzas was great! Very chewy and not rubbery at all. My favorite part is when they came with a big Parmesan wheel and shaved off some for our food :)",

Having gone for lunch on a weekday post lunch time the service was slow and delayed. The water and cold drink were not refilled at reguar intervals. The wait time for taking orders and food service was late.   The garlic bread was freshly baked. It had a delicate garlic profile with crisp bread edges which were not too hard to chew. The tomato basil pasta however was sloppily served. I was shocked when they prepared it with canned tomatoes. The only basil flavour was from the huge basil leaves placed on the pasta. The texture of pasta was soft. It was clearly overcooked.  Being a sweet lover I ordered the Tiramisu. This was also a disaster. The cookies were soggy and the tiramisu tasted pre prepared.   I am a huge fam of Wolfgang Puck. But Cucina does not live upto the name. It is more like a fast food joint than a restaurant.",

Our table was waiting when we arrived; our server was very personable and took care of us well.  We used a 2 for 1 entree certificate we earned through playing My Vegas video games online.  You play for free and earn points towards certificates such as dining or rooms to be used at any MGM properties as well as other venues in Vegas, such as Wolfgang Puck's Cucina.  Check it out!  I had the Ribeye - medium rare, pancetta, roasted potatoes, brown butter spinach and salsa verde.  My husband had the Osso Buco, creamy polenta and herb gremolata.  Both were superb!  He had a barrel aged Old Fashioned and I had a tasty Malbec.  We were treated to a complementary dessert, a flourless chocolate cake with hazelnut sorbet.  That was delicious!  This was the second time we have eaten at Cucina and both times the food and service were excellent.  We highly recommend Cucina!",

The Chicken Parmesan and prosciutto were probably the highlights of the night. It was cooked perfectly and the breading was crispy. The Pappardelle was also good! The pasta's texture was  really on point. We ordered the NY steak (medium well) from the 3 course meal (with extra charge). There was a good crust on it was still tender inside. Finally the sea bass was good, but it still had a somewhat fishy smell to it, which I personally do not like but it was bearable.   Adding on! The waitstaff was exceptionally accommodating and courteous! I scrapped my foot from my heels and asked if they had a bandaid and the waiter, Apolo, brought me more than enough bandaids to patch up my scrapes. He was extremely attentive and made our dining experience very memorable. We couldn't have asked for a more helpful person to wait our table.  However, service is a bit too slow for my liking. I arrived at 7:20 and am still here at 9:20 waiting for my dessert to arrive and it is not packed here.   Other than that, I would recommend this place to anyone! I made a reservation a hour before and when I arrived I was seated immediately. If you're someone who likes to take your time and enjoy your drink while eating a great meal, this will definitely not be a problem.  Note: the restaurant is located in the Crystal next to Aria. From what I know, there is a self parking in Aria.",

Instead, we ordered one meal off their fixed price menu with rigatoni, caeser salad, and tiramisu and another entree of spaghetti. The salad and rigatoni were very good according to my husband and my spaghetti was decent. Although I prefer my red sangria stronger, I loved the small cuts of apple in it.  The tiramisu was light, fluffy and not too sweet - so it was a great dessert. Overall, the service was fantastic and I didn't mind eating in the open mall - it was strangely relaxing but formal.",

We ordered a glass of the Beringer Cabernet, a glass of Chianti, a Virgin Bloody Mary, two of the special tomato bruschetta, the sea bass, and the mushroom pizza with arugula instead of the hen egg.    Wow!!! Food was fantastic.  Loved the bruschetta...very refreshing.  The pizza was delightful as well.  I have been to Spago in Caesar's, Postrio (now closed) in the Benetian, and the Wolfgang Puck in the MGM l.  I usually like the MGm location but I think this is not my fav spot.  I like how it's great for people-watching but you get better service, a more chill ambiance, and, in my opinion, slightly better food.  Will be back! Thank you, Adam!",

    "text": "Decent place on the Las Vegas strip. I wasn't impressed for the price, but that's the Vegas mark-up, I guess.  I ordered the gnocchi in bolognese, which was solid if plain. I expected a bigger size for the entree, especially compared to my friend's side dish of mac and cheese, which had more than twice the amount of pasta. That struck me as strange. I'm also not 100% convinced that the bolognese is totally authentic, but I may be a stickler for it since I make it, myself.   The sangrias are cheap and yummy.  I would not return - there are so many restaurants on the strip, might as well find one I actually really enjoy!",

Despite this restaurant being at the ever-so-prestigious Crystals Shopping Center, prices for our drinks and entrees were not as expensive as we thought.  Honeybabe started off with a delicious soup that had chicken, vegetables and chickpeas in it. Very flavorful! For our entrees, I got Rigatoncini with Piemontese Meat Sauce, Garlic and Parmesan Reggiano. He ordered Veal Raviolis with Porcini Mushrooms, Brown Butter Sauce and Crisp Sage. We both LOVED our entrees!!!!!! Everything was cooked to our liking and service was attentive throughout the night.  One thing is for sure; this restaurant have perfect portion control. I'm an extremely small eater. Half of an appetizer and I'm practically full already. That's how easy it is for me lol. But that night, I was able to finish my pasta. Every bite. Done. AND....best part was, I wasn't overly full....I didn't feel fat and bloated.   We definitely enjoyed our food and can't wait to be back. Next time....we want to try their wood fried oven pizzas. I got my eye on that spicy pepperoni pizza. Yumm!!!!!!",

The only downside I would say is that they took the spaghetti and meatball entree off the menu. Now you have to order spaghetti pasta and a side of meatballs. It went from a reasonably priced entree of $15-20 to almost double. While it's a simple and classic dish, theirs is amazing. The pizzas are great and reasonably priced too.",

Lots of staff just hanging around talking to each other.  There were like seven in a group bee boping - yet cokes empty.   Just totally different.  I won't come back.  Management seems to not make the staff know customers are important.  Too many other options on the strip.  Sad sad sad cuz this was the place I ate every single first day I arrive in Vegas - both personal and business.   Just not anymore.  Maybe the staff knows the place is going down hill.  Again mr new chef, the old menu preparation was better.  My partners food was over cooked by the way.  The whole place was a let down after five years of constantly going there.  Very sad.  No more my go to place and no longer the place is take visitors.  Both dishes weren't even plated nicely. It was just put there on an oval plate, the proper way to serve an Italian dish like carbonara or spaghetti is in a bowl or shallow bowl.  Flat linguini on a flat plate.  Makes it like someone with no culinary experience did this.  The whole thing / meal didn't make sense. It was like before it was high end - now it's like silly run of the mill.  Service bad.  Meal bad.  Plating bad.   Four cubes of butter with bread where any wolf gang puck elegant meal would have like oil or some butter mixed with something to be special.   Nothing is special about this place anymore.    Again sad that after 20+ times of coming here I have no desire to return.  I've brought so many guests here too.    Bottom line - from elegant and special to run of the mill blah.",

None the less, the assorted cheese tray, the desert which like a turtle pie but WAY BETTER to the Grilled Cheese, it was a good time.

The calamari was tender and crispy with a light breading.  The sauces that came with it was a lemon-pesto and a cocktail sauce.  Both were amazing and kept it fresh.  I had the margherita pizza which seems fairly plain but was the best margherita pizza i've had.  The salty cheese and crispy soft bread and the savory tomato sauce all complimented each other.    My SO had the cheese panini with tomato soup; the best that she's ever had and she's a grilled cheese and tomato soup fanatic.  We were so full we couldn't order dessert.  I would definitely come back again",

The creamy sauce was not flavorful and tasted like it came out of a jar. The crust was nothing memorable. The salad was a typical run-of-the-mill salad.

Most palates nowadays are numbed down by basic ingredients that only appeal to fatty flavors.  Nothing wrong with that but it takes a True chef to bring together flavors and sauces to make a mouth of happy.  Enter Wolfgang.  This restaurant has only been open for around 2 years.  It is a great option to still have some of Wolfgang Puck's meals without the super expensive price tag.  The meats are fresh and flavorful as are the pasta's.  His Cesar salad is made with blue cheese and was one of my favorites.  You can get a pitcher of sangria for around $20.",

We waited at the bar and ordered some drinks off the happy hour menu which was an excellent value.  The red sangria was amazing although a lot of the small pieces of fruit were orange peels that you can't actually eat.  Anyways, how do you not allow a party to transfer the tab over to the table???!?  Seriously, with all the technological advances why would you inconvenience the customer so?  The bartender also rudely informed us we were not allowed to order any happy hour apps since we were moving to a table.  I must say I was relieved that the night began to take a turn for the better.  We had the calamari, the shrimp scampi, the platter of meats, the prosciutto, and the special flatbread pizza as appetizers.  The prosciutto and the meats were the best apps although I'd order all of them again.  I was more impressed with the complimentary bread and the appetizers than I was with my entree of linguine and clams which was pretty standard.  Good amount of clams and good pasta but it is hard to over deliver on such a dish.  The tiramisu was excellent and a nice portion.  Overall, the apps are a 5, the entree 4, and the service was a dud.  If you're not in a hurry and don't need a lot of attentiveness from you're waiter, then this place ultimately is a great value, especially in the location.  Sounds like they need some better management and logistics.",

Our waitress was really great and came to our table right away to ask us about drinks. She also had what I like to call \"The Sense\" which is that she knows how often to check in rather than too much or too little. I've mentioned this before checking-in sense before in previous reviews. Overall she was great. The bus boy was also pretty on point about filling up our waters and bringing out bread. Service was A-OK.  As for food, the calamari w/ garlic aioli appetizer was definitely a good choice. Awesome to share between 3-4 people. Unfortunately, it was just me and my gf so we got a little bit filled up from it that we weren't fully hungry for our entrees. I ordered the pesto lamb which was tasty but just a little too salty for my taste. The mashed potatoes and spinach it comes with were really good though. She got the prime rib which she really enjoyed and I took a bit and it was legit.   Overall it was a good dining experience. Food was a little too salty for me and a little pricey for where we were but the service was good. No need to come back but a solid choice nonetheless.",

Loved that the waiter sensed our disappointment and instead gave us some free shots.  Now if that isn't customer service, I don't know what is!  The food and service is excellent.  Very efficient on water refills.  I was excited to try a Wolfgang Puck joint and was definitely not disappointed (aside from the sangria).  I opted for a pizza, my sister had the lasagna.  Both were the best of the best that we have had.  I enjoyed the casual yet \"fancy\" feel of the restaurant.  Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely stop in for the happy hour specials, which I hear are awesome.",

He was attentive and knew the menu inside and out.  He recommended the chef's choice antipasti so we went with it.  It featured a number of random antipasti items on a platter to share.  It was unbelievably good!  For my entree I went with the fettuccine carbonara with a side plate of meatballs.  The carbonara was stellar and the meatballs were about as good as you can get.  The next time I visit Las Vegas I'll definitely be back for more! Highly recommended!",

This last trip, however, we stayed at the aria and tried this location out. It was the worse experience I've ever had. We had just drove in from Orange County, so we had on some comfy active wear(I mention this because it felt like they were judging our outward appearance). Right when we walked in we were given dirty looks by the staff. It took a few minutes for us to even be acknowledged and seated, when the entire restaurant had roughly 3 tables filled. Once seated it took over 15 minutes for our waiter to come over. He had the snootiness demeanor that I've ever encountered. Not once we're we approached with a smile or warm disposition. Each waiter that passed by our table was looking at us like we have 2 heads. We felt extremely uncomfortable and by the time our food came we requested to eat it in our rooms. I don't know what is wrong with the staff here, but they need a lesson in customer service. I will never return to this location again and advise others to do the same. This happened over a month ago and I'm still upset with how poorly we were treated.",

We happened upon this delightful little restaurant while window shopping in the Crystal Mall.  We were able to sit right down with no reservation.    Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful when selecting what to eat.  We skipped appetizers since we weren't opting for a big meal and the bread plate is excellent!  I had the chicken piccata and my aunt had the salmon which they cooked to her liking with no complaints (she likes it well done).  The chicken piccata was very tasty and also a very large portion!  My aunt also enjoyed her salmon and said it was the best meal she had in Vegas!  We also ordered the sauteed jumbo asparagus with prosciutto breadcrumbs on the side.  Oh my, they were delicious!  Love the prosciutto breadcrumbs.  Thumbs up to this smallish and sorta casual restaurant in the heart of Vegas.   We're not too picky when it comes to wine so I can't speak to their wine list but we did enjoy what we had!",

The restaurant itself is located in a great spot. It was a lot of fun to dine in the new and super upscale shopping area at City Center. The atmosphere of the place was nice...I would have liked to sit in the bar area.   We made reservations for our Saturday night dinner and there was definitely no reason to. There were only a few tables full when we arrived at 7pm. Maybe we were there a bit early? I don't know how dinner in Vegas usually works. Either way, the place was fairly empty for a Saturday night. We were given our table immediately and the server greeted us shortly after.   I have to say that if this review was based solely on service...it would get a much higher rating. Our servers were incredibly attentive: our drinks were always full, plates were removed quickly, and the servers were friendly without over-doing it.   Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. Our food was incredibly disappointing. It wasn't disgusting, but it lacked flavor and quality. The prices weren't overly expensive (especially for Vegas), but I was expecting much more. I have had many a pizza in Phoenix that could easily kick the ass of the margherita pizza I ordered. The mozzarella wasn't fresh and the whole thing tasted fairly commercial. Wolfgang...you really let me down on this one.   So to sum this up...  Service = 5 Stars Atmosphere = 3 stars Food = 2 stars  Would I go back? Maybe...but probably not.",

First they had us wait for 5 minutes as they set the table up. I didn't mind until later... We ordered pretty quick but it took the waiter awhile to come take our order. We ordered and this pair of women arrived after us and ordered after us. The women seemed to get their food first and you can see they complained about their food and also got their replacement before we even got our food. We waited 40 minutes before we said anything. Every time we tried to get the waiters attention, he just so happened to walk away... Once we got his attention about what was taking so long, he said the food would be coming out. The food came out but it was spaced out by 15 minutes every 2 dishes... plus my boyfriends skirt steak wasn't even medium rare(which we asked for medium rare), it was well done. My friends chicken was too dry to eat. We ended up complaining about the wait and that we were in a hurry to catch a show. The manager apologized and gave us free dessert and comped two dishes. For how much you are paying for this dinner, i expect a lot better service and good food especially in Vegas. The chefs in the kitchen need to time their orders better. We also saw another couple just get up and leave because the food was bad and/or it took so long.  I can tell you, we will not be returning to this establishment next time we are in Vegas. You expect better food and service since there is so much competition in Vegas.",

    "text": "Last week we visited Cucina by WP for the first time. Of course the food was good and our server provided excellent service. Overall I was impressed with the quality of everything but had to drop a few stars for lack of consideration by the hostess.   Let's start with the good. My husband ordered the lasagna special while I decided to go with the pappardelle wild boar ragu. The lasagna tasted good but my husband said he's had better lasagna at one of our popular local spots on Sacramento. No doubt about it he ate it all though! The pappardelle was really good. There was a lot of meat and the sauce was delicious. The portion sizes were just enough for the both of us. Our parents all said the also enjoyed their dinners- salmon, pork chops and seabass. My father in law couldn't get enough of the passion fruit iced tea.   My only complaint was for the hostess to have a little more consideration. Yes, I understand that our MyVegas comps are 1 per table. So I said that fine, seat us at different tables. But if we are a party of 6 with grandparents why separate is in different parts of the restaurant. My parents were seated in one spot, my husband and I were wayyy on the otherside secluded from everyone (maybe because we had a kid with us) and they were about to seat the other set of grandparents in another section. I requested at least the grandparents be seated at tables next to each other so that they could chat. It made no sense other than for server tips or whatever to seat us in different areas of the restaurant far from each other when one set of the grandparents were sitting at a table along a long bench against the way with two other empty tables next to them. In the past 2 years we've been to WP Lupo at Mandalay Bay and WP at MGM and they were much more considerate and even let us all sit together. Just for the convenience and consideration we might just skip this location next time- the other two locations were way better.",

    "text": "I usually enjoy Wolfgang Puck restaurants. There are so many here in Vegas, but this is one of the few I haven't been to. It's located in the The Shops at Crystal. I picked Cucina because it's so close to the Bellagio and I'm bringing kids, so I can't travel too far.     We were seated immediately at a table by a window. It's a perfect place for people watching because everyone takes a detour through here to avoid the sun and catch some A.C. Plus I find the atmosphere and decor to be modern and clean but still warm. It's also a very open space, so I don't feel crowded or rushed. I ordered a fixed price meal for myself and a kids pizza for my daughter. Yes, they have a kids menu. That's like an automatic bonus point for me. Included in my meal was a starter, a main course and a desert. I opted for an eggplant bruschetta as my starter and added a pepperoni pie for the main dish. My wife ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer and the ravioli with white asparagus, mushrooms and peas.     \"Well how did it taste?\" You ask. I though the food was delicious across the board! Both appetizers were tasty but my bruschetta was tiny and left me hungry. The scampi on the other hand was a big portion and tasted \"lick your fingers\" good! My pizza was rustic or simple. It had a thin crust cooked crispy with a basic tomato sauce and a good amount of kick thanks to the pepperoni. Even better than my pie was the ravioli. The sauce and filling were creamy and buttery, but surprisingly not heavy. The mushrooms do a solid job filling in for a protein, so you're not left feeling hungry. I thought it was the best thing on the menu and worth coming back for.     For desert we split the tiramisu and zeppoles. A zeppole is basically fried dough with a creamy filling. This version was absolutely amazing and came with a side of warm strawberry preserves that could have been served on its own. The tiramisu was very good as well. It was light and had a cinnamon and rum kick to balance the drizzled chocolate on the plate. I enjoyed every course and thought the value was worth $35 a person.    Without a doubt, my food was great. My only complaint was how much time I spent here. It took WAY TOO LONG! I was here for over 90 minutes and I didn't order drinks or anything out of the ordinary. It took our server 20 minutes to take our payment and process our check. She literally dissspeared with my credit card for 20 minutes and didn't come back to give us an update. That kinda behavior makes me nervous as a customer. And I know that nothing funny was happening with my stuff. I know the only reason I had to wait was because next to us was a large party and all 13 of them were paying with a split checks or doing something super complicated. But that's not a ME problem, that's a YOU problem. And when I'm at a nice restaurant, I'm paying extra so that ME is treated well. I'm still going to recommend you grab a meal at Cucina, but don't be surprised if getting out takes a little while.",

    "text": "We came for a late dinner, at around 9pm and were seated promptly. Our waiter was very polite and helpful in explaining the menu, wine options & prie fixe menu. We started with a glass of wine and a ginger & pineapple moscow mule.   We decided that we didn't need 2 desserts (regrets). So my husband got a meatball pizza and I ordered off the prie fixe menu. The meatball pizza was absolutely delicious, I would highly recommend it. The meatballs were very soft, and spiced well. The ricotta cheese was also a really nice touch. The crust was great too.   For the prie fixe dinner, I ordered the bruschetta, rigatoni & tiramisu. The bruschetta was really good, but kind of odd because it wasn't covered in tomatoes like I expected. But the little greens on the top was super good! The rigatoni was also super good, the sauce was a little watery but super tasty. The noodles were cooked well and there were tons of mushrooms. I added a healthy dose of fresh Parmesan too, so good! The tiramisu was good but more chocolatey than I expected too, but it was good. Our friend also did the prie fixe menu with a bruschetta, margherita pizza & Vanilla Zeppole.   The star of the meal for us was the vanilla zeppole! He didn't totally know what he was ordering, but we were so surprised when it came out. It was so fresh and warm, the Carmel sauce was super yummy too. Either way, everything we had was great, no complaints, but you have to order the vanilla zeppole!!!",

    "text": "Disappointing! Read previous reviews, ordered the most popular dishes, left feeling like we'd made the amateur mistake of going to a named chef's version of Applebee's. Nothing was bad, but no part of the experience was better than ok. The bread ($5-$8 depending which bread you opt for, also a small portion for the price) was quite greasy, but the trio of dips were quite tasty. The chicken parmigiana was a large portion, but bland tomato sauce, and the cheese hadn't been fully melted on the chicken, which had been slightly over-fried. Et cetera. Overall, it felt like we'd ended up with a heavy, oily, salty, excessively cheesy and somehow still boring dinner. Service was fine, not the best (we had to flag the server down and ask for water refills after sitting with empty glasses for a while). A note about the atmosphere- the restaurant is open to the mall, and it feels like you're sitting in the mall. I suspect this is a better place for breakfast/lunch vs. dinner.",

A trio of appetizers, salad, pasta, entree(I had the Sea Bass) and then a wonderful desert board with three different deserts.

I thought the octopus was eh...kinda lacked a punch. Maybe could use some more acid. It's not a winning dish.  The pizza was not bad. Consider the price too I thought it was pretty doable. The crust wasn't too dried up and the proscuitto was pretty good. The tomato sauce helped since I tried my friend's pizza that didn't have it and I thought the tomato sauce gave it that extra punch to the pizza. It really helped.  My favorite and winning dish was that ravioli. The sauce was very good and the inside was tasty. Prob could eat that all day. It came with like 8? ravioli but yea I recommend this dish.   Service was pretty nice too but they weren't busy at all so that added to it I guess. haha",

Our bartender was awesome, even though he's a Yankees fan! We had the meatball pizza, a glass of red sangria and a good size cheese and meat plate and it was only $29.  What a deal.  The meatballs were so good.  The only suggestion would be to add something sweet, like honey or fruit spread to the cheese plate.    I would def like to go back to order off the full menu someday.",

And their pizza was ehhhh. I'm just surprised how low quality the food was. I will never go back by my choice. Sorry, I try not to leave too negative comments on these, but this one had too big of a difference between the star numbers and what was actually provided.",

I gave the waiter a very generous tip which he DID NOT deserve!! $35 on a $112  check. Had to beg the entire time to refill our water, tea, ice for the warm wine,,, etc.. no salt & pepper on the table. Ordered a pizza & would have liked red Chile flakes for but he never came by. Never checked on us or asked if we needed anything. Then we decided to order more wine which my friend paid for. So we opened a new check. You would think after he got his tip he would have changed his attitude. Nope! Keep having to ask the busboy, who was nice, to get our waiter. Mind you as I said the Restaurant was not busy so I don't know what we were keeping him from. I work Front Desk at one of the largest properties. I rarely go out on the strip, but when I do I am so sad to receive such shitty service! Would never treat our guests as such! You are the reason locals don't want to go out on the strip, and the reason why guests are reviewing Vegas as very expensive with a mediocre experience! Get your service together or get another job.   Wolfgang I lived here 23 years and always loved & patronized your restaurants. I HATE when guests tell me they will never return to our hotel. But I have to say I am feeling the same way. Absolutely disgusted with the way we were treated today!!",

Located in the Aria area, this restaurant is the Italian spot, not to get confused with the one in MGM, which is more American food. We called in ahead of time because we had a lot of people bug to be honest, it wasn't that packed when we got there anyways. Full disclosure, probably because of the prices. However, the service is very good here and very proficient. Although it not a huge restaurant, they can accommodate both couples to large parties. Food menu is simple and the quality is superb. Portions are on the smaller side but maybe that is for the best because of how delicious it all is! Definitely a place you could eat, chat and loose track of time. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Overall, any Wolfgang Puck is a good spot to eat and Cucina is a great place to do it, whether it be an intimate diner or a big party. Definitely recommend checking out!",

I really liked the pesto sauce that they came with! But the margherita pizza was cold and lacked flavor, other pizza was cold and the raviolis were rubbery. Worst of all with this meal were my drinks. The water that they gave us when we first got there had a funny taste like the glass hadn't been washed or the ice that was in it was really old and had sat in a freezer too long.

The service was lovely, our server was VERY educated, he knew everything there was to know about the menu & all the ingredients on it to the way each dish was prepared. The bruschetta was the best I've ever had. The olive oil they used was DELICIOUS with a slight sweetness. For my entree I had the fried eggplant, the best I've ever had as well. It was flash fried & then baked which creates absolute perfection, no oily or mushiness which is usually the issue with eggplant dishes. My aunt had the Veal ravioli with brown butter & sage. She thoroughly enjoyed it, I don't eat veal so I didn't try it, but I tasted one of the mushrooms so I could taste the sauce.... Phenomenal! I will definitely be returning here in the near future!",

    "text": "We'd had a big lunch that day & we're looking for something a little less fancy for dinner.  Wolfgang Puck's hit the spot!  Started with the Burrata starter -- delicious burrata and tomato bruchetta (for lack of a better way to describe it).  Yum!  Had a pizza and a pitcher of beer.  Go figure -- but it was perfect.  The pizza (it was the three or four meat one, I think?) was great.  Nice thin crispy crust, the meat toppings were crispy and cheese was bubbly and nicely browned.  High end ingredients makes a difference.  Service was good and relatively quick on the refills, clearing the appetizer plates, etc.  Definitely will go back when looking for a less structured meal in the Bellagio/Crystals area.",

After talking for a bit we noticed that nearly 15 minutes rolled by without anyone pouring water or coming to us. To the waiters defense, I think he may have been waiting for drinks for the other party, but still I was ticked from walking the whole strip to get here and being very thirsty!  When the waiter did show up everything went smoothly. The prices are more then I expected for a \"$$\" place but the quality justified it well. I had a tuscan potato with garlic and basil priced around $6. It was delicious and the portion decent as well. My other friend got a cheese pizza and he said it was amazing, he said he liked how the moz and parm cheeses blended to create a UNIQUE flavor experience. My other friend is sleeping so I can't ask him. We had it yesterday you see and it was a long night that I am glad that I chose Wolfgang puck to start it off.   Sodas are $3.50 (with refills) to give a good measure on prices.    Knocked off a star because of that waiter who was late with my water. Dang him. That chap was a humorous fellow.",

I never got past how terrible the seating was ...low ottoman's that were more suited to Roman style \"eat lying down\" than an actual meal...(I must have missed the \"servent with fan feeding me grapes\" option?)  ...so low that you felt your knees were in your chin...not a good way to eat.  There was a variety of heights in the restaurant,  up to tall bar-stool style...but what we were unfortunate enough to get was awful and uncomfortable.  What were you thinking man? I spent half the evening trying to stretch my legs out to relieve the cramps .  Oh yes...and they also had food and wine there.  Sent the salad back as the vinaigrette dressing was so tart it made me spit the salad out!   Ravioli was edible.    wine selection and pricing was the best thing there...not overpriced for once (that earned you back a star)",

She had one bite and was disgusted although she didn't return it or make a fuss they took it away and didn't offer to replace with anything, we figured they would just take it off the check. They didn't. Barely saw our server. The busser mostly did everything for us. All in all, place was nice a little expensive, but chances are I probably won't be returning.",

The service was top notch and prices aren't that bad for a \"Strip\" location. It is located on the 2nd level Crystals. They offer an all day happy hour that features some drink and app specials.

The Crystals @ Aria is a stunning addition to the strip with its striking architectural design and minimalist interior plus it has NATURAL LIGHT.   This WP is a casual open air bistro with fantastic food, great service, and decent prices. I sat at the bar and loved everything that the bartender/server Carlos recommended. It was also the happy hour with drink and appetizer specials. I had the grilled pork belly (delicious and crispy), asparagus & prosciutto salad (amazing and I wish I could eat this every day), and fried fritti with spinach dip (tasty fluffy dough balls).   Honestly, I probably could have eaten here everyday and been content. I highly recommend checking out Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria & Cucina.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  The restaurant is located smack in the center of the premium shopping center, Crystal's. That being said, the prices are surprisingly reasonable, or so I thought before I ordered food.   Service is great; friendly staff who deal with tourists every single day, and are still able to serve you with a smile.    Now on to the 'edibles'.  Ack, what a disappointment.  I ordered a citrus tea to drink, which was supposed to be an iced tea flavoured with a mint syrup. I might as well have ordered an Arizona iced tea. It was overbearingly sweet and tasted like store bought bottled tea. Why would a chef put his name on this stuff?  To eat I ordered the baby artichokes. These were quite fine. Tender, well seasoned, and refreshing as a antipasto.   For my main I ordered a prosciutto pizza, thinking it would be the smart thing to order at a pizzeria. The prosciutto was of great quality, sliced very thinly and was very fresh. The rest of it was horrible. The dough was flat, dense and chewy. It clearly was pre-rolled and refrigerated. The cheese was quite off-putting, it was coagulated in all the wrong places  and full of little holes; bland and flavorless.   It was quite a shocking pizza, as a fellow yelper commented, dominos would make better pizza. I don't understand what the massive kitchen is used for, but there is clearly no fresh dough being kneaded and no wood-oven in it either. Thankfully the bartender took the pizza off the bill when I questioned whether the pizza had been made that day.   I would not recommend this to anyone, except maybe for a cocktail as it has a nice view and a kickass decor. For 20$ a pizza, it is not a good value at all, which is saying a lot as that is quite cheap for Vegas.

    "text": "I had the spaghetti and meatballs here last July, and it was so good that I've had it on my mind ever since (no joke). I recall it being hot and hearty with the perfect balance of sauce, noodle, meatball. I even made a trip to the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at LA Live back in LA, hoping the spaghetti and meatballs would be just as good (it wasn't - too oily).  So, lots to live up to on this visit to Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina. And it did, for the most part. We started with the prosciutto with mozzarella and the caprese salad. Delicious. And of course I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs for my entree. It was good - well, great - but not as good as I remembered it (I guess that's almost always how it works out, though). I wish the meatballs were a tad hotter. And there to be some more noodles, to make that perfect sauce, noodle, meatball ratio. But now I'm just being picky. To drink, the wine list had what we wanted - a bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc at just $36. We finished our dinner off with the tiramisu - different from traditional tiramisu (think less soggy, more dense and solid) - which I actually liked, so a \"win\" there.  Overall, I'd definitely go back. A great location in Crystals/Aria, delicious food, and reasonable pricing.",

They were the best brussel sprouts I have ever consumed in my entire life (sorry mom).  But I seemed to be the only person super impressed with my meal. Everyone else seemed to say their food was just OK.  Aside from the food being good, the service was kinda wack for a nice restaurant.  The dude spilled hella our Sangria while he was pouring it, even on one of the girls legs, and on top of that, they took forever to bring just a side of ranch.

Not one of us could even eat the food without first putting lemon juice on it to neutralize the saltiness.  Not to mention that my friend's linguini had most of the creamy sauce in it while mine was mostly butter and herbs (they were made in the same pan, so wtf?!) I've always known Wolfgang Puck's restaurant was nothing to write home about, but this experience was extremely disappointing.  It wasn't cheap, either.  And no soda refills were offered, just weird tasting tap water.  Which also needed lemon just to make it tolerable.  Ridiculous.",

A lot- anyone having a wedding at the Aria or a nearby hotel should DEFINITELY consider having a reception here! So we had a room in the restaurant that I wish I would have photographed so that others on here could see. It was super nice, elegant but not stuffy. It was perfect for the dinner. We had around 3 dozen, but my guess is you could probably add another dozen or two.   The food was awesome. A few appetizers and pizzas were selected for the tables and were all very good. The pizzas were particularly excellent!! I would definitely come back here just for the pizza. Most everyone enjoyed there meals or loved their meals that came afterward. The only ding I would give them is that the drinks were a bit on the very weak side; however they tasted fantastically!  The bride mentioned how easy it was for her to work with the staff to make this event happen, and they decided to go with WPP&C on a last minute change of plans and they worked with them seamlessly.   I will definitely head back here next time I am in Vegas, which is often, and will tell friends!!",

Even though it's located in the mall, it's pretty peaceful.  This mall doesn't have as much traffic, so it's a nice setting.  Service from the staff was awesome.  Our main course did come out on the slow side though.  Food, at least, tasted awesome.  ANTIPASTA SALAD: They don't have side salads, but they have half portions.  I had this and it was awesome.  This salad has salami, provolone picante, red onion, and red wine vinaigrette.  The picante and red onion add just the perfect spicy little kick to this.  RIGATOCINI: I loved my dish and fished the whole thing!!  It's made with Piemontese Meat Sauce, Garlic, and Parmesan Reggiano.  I am a red meat sauce type of person and this nailed it for me.  Added crushed red pepper to this dish for an extra added kick.  Portion size is on perfect so that you're not overly stuff, yet satisfied.  SPAGHETTI: This dish comes with tomatoes, basil, garlic, and four big homemade meatballs.  This is definitely a safe dish.  I took a bite from my mom's dish and it came nothing short of expectation.    SIDENOTE: We had to ask for bread and butter. So if you're a carb lover, feel free to ask your waiter and they'll be glad to grab it for you. (:",

    "text": "actual rating review: 3.5 Stars  I been going to Las Vegas for a long time. The entire time I have wanted Spago to be my first Wolfgang Puck eatery experience. But due to time constraints during my recent trip, we settled on Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina, located inside the Crystal Shops.  My friends and I ate here over Super Bowl weekend for lunch. We were quite surprised that there was no wait to be seated. We were promptly seated and introduced to our waiter. We ordered the following:  (2) orders of the Rigatoncini Piemontese Meat sauce, Garlic & Parmesan Reggiano.     The piemontese meat sauce (italian beef cut) was a nice change from the usual rigatoni w/ meat sauce I have had in years past. I thought the portion size was a little small considering its price point and there was no main protein present. This dish was decent, but not mindblowing; it lacked a gamechanging flavor punch.  (1) order of the Spaghetti, tomatoes, basil, garlic with house made meatballs. homemade meatballs? COUNT ME IN. These meatballs are the best meatballs I have ever had. Spaghetti cooked al dente. Now this is a dish I would come to WPP& C for!  Service was excellent and the food was yummy. Get the spaghetti meatballs, forego the Rigatoncini Piemontese.",

For entrees I had the burrata ravioli and my husband had spaghetti and meatballs, both full size portions, there is an option to order half portions.

I came and had lunch with my friend and when we first came in we weren't greeted by a hostess which we've eaten here for dinner and they have a hostess at night so I found it odd that lunch service didn't have a hostess. I was greeted by a gentleman who ended up being my server. Which normally I wouldn't mind but this was not Apple bees I was eating at. Heck Apple bees has hostesses, the point of this review was the fact that, that was what I noticed first when I came into the restaurant and then during my meal the phone where I walked In at was ringing which I found annoying. So my server was taking our order while the phone was ringing, There was a gentleman in a suit just standing around I don't know if he worked there or not but he seemed to talk angrily at the people working there kind of rude if you ask me!! none the less if you want a pleasant lunch don't eat here you'll hear the phone ringing with no one to pick up and if you ever want to see someone in a suit whom I'll assume is the manager treat their staff rude like, don't eat here during lunch. My dinner experience has been better so far. So next time I'll skip lunch here and have dinner.",

My group was greeted by a server who's name I think was Sean? I forget but he was attentive and gave some great recommendations. My friend and I split the rigatoni and the Italian meat pizza.  The rigatoni was great and tomatoey! Loved the flavor and it came out piping hot, nearly burned my tongue! The pasta still had a nice bite to it and how it was made perfectly captured the sauce.  The Italian meat pizza lived up to it's name. Lot's of delicious meats my favorite one was the coppa. The crust was nice and crispy and served as a great vessel to dip in the extra rigatoni sauce I had leftover.  The food was great the service was nice and the 20% made this experience that much sweeter. I'd definitely come back!",

    "text": "I was on a work trip and staying at the Mandarin Oriental. It was during lunch and most places around were busy. I happen to walk by Cucina and noticed some seats available at the bar. I've been to other Wolfgang places and have always been impressed with the food.  This was no different. I ordered their salad and added grilled salmon that was perfectly cooked. The salad was well balanced and not over dressed.  Being an Italian themed restaurant I had to add a side of meatballs. They came out scorching hot and delicious - yum!  A reason why I didn't give it a 5 star although the food was great and the bartender was super nice, they were a bit slow in taking my order as well as bringing the food out.  The gentleman next to me had a harder time as he was obnoxiously complaining. Nonetheless it was entertaining for me.  I'd definitely recommend if you are looking for a bite that is not too pricey and packed due to the casino or hotel crowd as this location is in a high end mall attached to Aria.",

The restaurant was not busy at all and we were seated within a few minutes. We ordered two pappardelles with lamb ragu, one orichette, and one prosciutto pizza.   The papparadelle was amazing, sauce was so flavorful and delicious with generous chunks of meat. The pasta itself was cooked al dente with just a tiny bit of firmness remaining. My only complaint was that I wish there was more! This was my favorite dish of the evening. The proscuitto pizza was good but I did not think merited the $26 price tag. One plus, the crust was cooked nice and crisp the way I liked it. My friend also enjoyed his orichette, so much that he used the complimentary sour dough bread to lap up the extra sauce.  Overall, we had a great dinner here and our server was so sweet and accommodating. I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner or lunch and it seems that they have a decent happy hour too.",

Fresh and crunchy greens, none of that wilted stuff. It was perfectly dressed and big enough to share.  Actually it should be unless you have a big appetite.  We both had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was so delicious! The service was friendly and swift. The atmosphere is kind of cool looking out over the shops of Crystals. I'm adding this one to my list for next years visit. I highly recommend Cucina.",

This is saying something as I always order cheese boards at restaurants. Most of the cheeses were so dry, we felt like we were chewing on an old rind. Ew!",

I also liked the setting/atmosphere. Very open and casual.  Fritto Misto - Good but not great. It's cool that they have this rather than straight calamari, but the ratio of protein to veggies was subpar. Seasoning and execution were very good. Just wish there was more shrimp and calamari. Would not order again.  Meatballs - Solid. I know it's Vegas/name brand price inflation, but a bit too expensive for the portion size imo. I'd still order again.  Pappardelle - Good but not great. A bit too bland imo. The flavors were good and everything was cooked properly.. just felt like it was missing something. Prob wouldn't order again.  Linguine Frutti di Mare - The main event. The one. The reason I'll go back. At $36, the price to portion size is def Vegas style, but not the worst offender. Whatever. YOLO. I'm used to a tomato based sauce for this dish, so I was a little disappointed when I saw white wine on the description. F that. That sauce was ridiculous. The bowl was seemingly empty, with a little sauce left at the bottom. I nearly broke the guy's arm when he tried to clear it. Dip some bread and MAGIC. I'm usually afraid to overhype things. This dish is hypebeast immune.",

Typically we head to Gordon Ramsays at Planet Hollywood or Mona Mi Gabi at Paris.   Our party of 8 dined on a Friday night around 8pm. It was steady but not terribly busy. Everyone's food looked delicious including the calamari, chicken cacciatore and salmon. The prosciutto pizza and was amazing. Especially with sangria. Our server unfortunately never came back with our refills after we gave him the check.   One surprising thing was that a restaurant that nice had such dirty bathrooms. The design of the bathrooms is a very neat concept where the men and women converge at the hand washing sinks. However, there was trash and paper towels on the floor, wet floors in the stalls, no toilet paper and full trash bins. I felt more dirty leaving the bathroom than before entering.   All in all, the evening was a success and I would go back but would hope it was more well kept.",

The food:   I had their vegetarian option of a mozzarella pesto panini sandwich, creamy tomato soup, and mixed green salad. Everything was very good. I really enjoyed the crusty bread that added to the crispiness of the sandwich, but I especially loved the tomato soup. It was thick and creamy and you can taste the tomato flavor without the acidity. I love idea of  how it was served in a cup: brilliant.   Overall:   This place is an excellent place to enjoy a filling lunch with quality ingredients. I'd comeback in a heartbeat.",

We had a big, rich dinner planned and at the last minute decided we were tired and wanted to back out.  Instead we decided to have at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina. I'm so glad we did!  We got a great, private table overlooking the shops. We had a very helpful and personable server along with all the others who looked after us throughout our meal.  We shared all of our items, staring with a Caesar Salad.  Then we had the Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu, and the Spicy Sausage Pizza.  All of the dishes were fantastic, the pasta being a favorite.   We both ordered really delicious drinks - I ordered a nonalcoholic juice drink (Raspberry Velvet) with raspberries and cranberries and he ordered a Cucumber Gimlet which tasted like spa water.  Really happy and would come back to order other pastas and entrees that looked just as good!",

The honey and I arrived at about 9:00pm on a Wednesday night, only to be greeted by a surly and indifferent hostess who proceeded to a) give us the evil eye while b) continuing to talk to a customer on the phone.  Really?  No one could help us get seated while the restaurant was 80% empty?  After being seated, I found one of the water glasses had some lipstick stains on the rim.  Pointed it out to the bus-man, who barely even took a second look (and no apology).    Looked over our menus, then proceeded to sit at our table for another 10 minutes, hoping to catch the eye of our waitress.  She avoided eye contact.  In fact, she looked at every table but ours and our neighbor's, who had finished eating a while ago and were looking to get the check.  A frustrating experience, all in all.  The honey and I left before ordering, without even a glance from the surly hostess as we strode out the door.  I would forgive the indifferent service if this was a Chili's (or comparable chain restaurant) on a bustling weekend night, but this was neither.  A restaurant with a celebrity chef's name bills itself as a premium experience, and this was anything but.  Avoid.",

No contemporary american chef has had the impact that Puck has.  Brasserie Puck is another home-run for him. It's in the middle of the City Center mall, Crystals. A pleasant atmosphere, excellent service, and great casual french-bistro food combine to make BP worth the very long walk from the parking lot.  I had the Bistro Burger that comes with fourme d'ambert, my favorite cheese. It's a mouth-widening creation made with house-ground prime filet, and I never thought I'd say this but it's a serious threat to Bradley Ogden's rein as the best high-end burger in town.  The wine list is full of well-chosen, fairly-priced selections. And the management/service aspect is terrific. (My waiter had actually tasted every wine-by-the-glass on the list and therefore could make thoughtful recommendations.)  On top of that, there is a 25% discount for locals until the end of April, which makes Brasserie Puck an even more appealing destination.  I'm planning to go back soon because I've heard their Tuna-Burger is to die for.",

The bartender (who reminded me for all the world of Jim from \"The Office\") topped up my prosecco (moving along nicely). The kitchen initially advised that I couldn't have my chosen appetizer, then sent out a modified version made especially for me (Brownie points accumulating rapidly). Both of us had pizza which was really, really good. I asked the very personable bartender for a drink fit for a winner and he whipped one up. When the bill came, they were experiencing issues with the credit card system, so they knocked off one beer for the trouble (fantastic finish, boys). Check out the Chihuly's (good) on the way to the offputting semi-unisex bathroom (bad).",

We had to request a child's menu for the tween in our party and she ordered the spaghetti noodles with butter and Parmesan cheese.   She enjoyed it.   For our main entree, we shared a chicken parmigiana.  It was fresh and tasty, and was plenty to share since it had two chicken breasts.  The only downside to the evening was the first batch of bread...   it came out burned on one side, and it was plated burned side down.  The waiter said it was supposed to be that way, but brought out new bread that want \"well done\". We enjoyed our visit and wouldn't hesitate to visit again when we want Italian food.

Hey, we all have our priorities! My deck at home could flake off but my tummy is always happy.  However, Vegas and food are ridiculous. I just dropped $18 on a sad breakfast sandwich and a coffee. It's insane. It should have been just $8! So, last night's dinner at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina was a real treat as I didn't have to worry about the check.  My company took me and my colleagues for a very nice dinner at a private room here. It was so much fun as we have worked all day on Sunday and it was fun to see everyone at one place. Beer, wine, and cocktails were flowing and before we knew it, we were laughing and having a blast over heirloom bruschetta, calamari, and meatballs. All were tasty.  After that, we had a pasta course of bucatini with wild boar ragu that was to die for. It was  really delicious mix of thick savory tomato and jus mixed of a sauce with shreds of tender wild boar, kale, and hand rolled pasta. Yumm!  Though I was getting full, I still enjoyed the flat iron steak with potato and broccolini. The flat iron steak was surprisingly tender with great flavor on the meat. There was a salmon selection that looked good as well but I think I made the right choice.  Dessert was also surprisingly deeelicious!! It was an individual pie with peach filling with almond paste served warm with ice cream. That was a perfect combo for me. I don't believe I have ever loved a man more than I love a great warm pie. Well for one thing, the pie never argues with me. That's a big plus.  The room we were in was very nice and spacious enough to house all of us. There were over 30 people and it was just fine. The service was also impeccable. It was well done.  I am lucky that I work for a great company and my coworkers are just really awesome people. I really had a blast over Moscow Mule and Hefeweizen. Plus, no check to swipe a credit card for. Yay! I could make up some of the other meals since I saved tonight! Yeah, life of a per diem traveling worker! However, can't complain really.. Not tonight because yes, I am working but I am working in Vegas!!! Whoohoo!",

    "text": "Perfect $$ place in a luxury mall with a chill ambiance. Good for bar drinks (mixologists here are top notch), or dinner and drinks. Seats 2-6 people tables comfortably I think, so keep that in mind if in a large group. Overall, a surprising find in Vegas with great food and drinks at reasonable prices and decent portion sizes!   For apps, the speck salami was great! It was presented well and they provided a generous ish portion with ~6 slices, olives and 2 pieces of toasted bread.   I tried the burrata filled ravioli. It was earthy, creamy and zesty. Delicious. And vegetarian.   The fettuccine carbonara was creamy without being heavy/oily, and was perfectly balanced with bits of pancetta and zucchini.   The pork Milanese was the star. The meat was tender and moist and paired perfectly with the freshly squeezed lemon juice and mustard sauce (on the side). And since it's fried, the salad cut through the fat nicely. I loved this dish!   As far as drinks go, just get them ok? They are artisanal, special and well crafted. Plus their ice is clear, which I always like. I would rather go here than those other fancy bars like chandelier!   Expect to pay $25-30 without drinks.",

    "text": "3 is perhaps a little harsh anywhere else but by the high standards of Las Vegas, this place was a bit of a disappointment. Firstly, it was a crime for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant to make a huge spelling mistake on their set menu. \"Pre-Fix\" as they called it rather than Prix Fixe. Wolfgang would be furious if only he knew. Sadly he has sold himself out these days and has too many restaurants to be able to spend any time at any of them.  I started with the Caprese salad which was the highlight of my meal. The mozzarella (or maybe it was burrata) was creamy and delicious and went well with the assortment of tomatoes.  I then had the \"Tuesday Special\" which was lasagna. It wasn't bad but I'd back myself to make one just as good at home to be honest, and I wouldn't charge over $20 for it either! The garlic bread on the side was nothing special either - again nothing bad but nothing you or I couldn't make at home.  If you want good Italian close by then head to Carbone at the Aria for some 5* food and service.",

My family and I chose to eat here while we were shopping at mall where the restaurant is located because of the name - Wolfgang Puck!  My wife had a steak that was perfect - son had the best spaghetti we have ever tasted, my daughter had a burger which was fantastic and I had the salmon which was remarkable - I ordered asparagus which was the best I have ever had.    Management of the restaurant was very attentive and even went out of the way to make our visit special by granting us a small favor which my kids will remember.   If you have a chance the visit here is worth it - great value for a meal on the strip. We went back a couple more times during our stay and had incredible meals and great service each time.",

The pasta was fresh and delicious, and the sea bass came out like a Branzino and was well cooked and nicely seasoned with the vegetables. They gave me a free dessert which was greatly appreciated.

Love the cheese and meat trays. I know they just changed the menu and it has gotten more expensive and smaller portions and they have removed the pasta that would normally come with the main entrees for a separate charge and they also god rid of the chocolate cake.  For that reason I can't give them a 5 however a 4 would do.  How can you remove chocolate cake from the menu that's just bad business. No one removes chocolate from the menu.

I used to come before and the establishment was much better with several other dishes that were delicious. Why they decided to remove them from the menu was beyond me. Their salmon was dry and the lemon sauce bland and watery, the desserts and appetizers did not impress me. Their chicken Parmesan, a simple staple in Italian cuisine, was dry and bland as well. This restaurant does not keep up with their competitors on the strip in terms of pricing and quality. The only upside was the service. Someone always came by to refill waters, check on our dishes, and they were always friendly. Though we only saw our actual service twice throughout the entire meal..",

So we went with the wallet friendlier option and we were not disappointed. The pasta was delicious and fresh, we got the orecchiette and the pappardelle, they were both flavorful, hearty and delicious.  The pasta cooked perfectly and the orecchiette was the perfect shape to hold little morsels of fennel sausage that just enhanced everything about this dish. The pappardelle with wild boar ragu was the right amount of saucy and meaty.  The old fashioned that we had was potent in the best way possible...the wait staff was friendly and chatted with us like old friends...and oh yeah the 20% off the check for a yelp check-in was just icing on the cake. A great first dinner in Vegas!",

This restaurant is no different.  The host was exceptional, the waiter was one of the coolest I've met during our stay in Vegas.  He was courteous and actually pretty fun to talk to as we conversated about my awesome watch for a good 5 minutes.  Needless to say, service is awesome here.  As for the food.   I decided to pick up the pasta linguine while my friend had the Sauteed Chicken Piccata.  Both our dishes were absolute delicious.  The downer was my pasta was a bit bland in terms of flavor but overall everything else was solid.  The shrimps and clams were so freshly made.  The texture was beautiful and the taste was pretty good.  We kicked it there for a good hour plus just hanging and talking.  Then the dessert menu came out.   I actually forgot what the name of the dessert was but its basically 3 scooped flavors of ice cream or gelato and they tastes really good.  Actually really really really good.  I could have eaten them all day but goddamnit I was so full.  Well done Wolfgang Puck.    Overall this was definitely a great dining choice on my part.  Great service, excellent quality food and a great ambiance creates an incredible dinner experience for my friend and I.  I will definitely be back here again next time I'm in town.  Too good to pass up.  Give it a try.",

Skip the antipasti unless you really want something to nibble on. Nothing on the board was a standout.  The pasta was good. A bit salty but still good.  The Sea bass was good. Great texture, nice seasoning.   Overall decent, and with the yelp check in, a great price for a nice meal.",

We made a point to return when we were in town this past November (wait was too long for our first try, but we made it back the second night).  Unfortunately their chef and menu changed that week we were there.  Not sure if the new chef was still working out the kinks, but our table of 9 were pretty disappointed.  Pizza was okay, but the pastas were not good anymore.  Service was also meh this time around - even forgot to give us bread.  Given the options in Vegas, we don't feel compelled to try it again next time we're in town.",

    "text": "I've been home from vegas for a few days now, and I am still fantasizing about the lamb with fettuccine, and the goat-cheese stuffed peppers. 9 of us went to dinner for my cousins 21st celebration, and none of us left dissatisfied. We did the set family style menu. I could almost hear the grumblings from my sister, the worlds pickiest eater. Even she left happy. Sure, she didn't like the lamb or the goat cheese, but she said the ravioli and the chicken was to die for. What can I say, when I eat, I go for the weird stuff, not the stuff you can get anywhere. So I trust her judgement. One of our appetizers was an antipasti tray (its where the goat-cheese pepper came from ) and it was amazing. The meats, cheeses, and peppers were all beautifully prepared.   The service was good, nothing spectacular but overall very good. Our desserts came out disproportionately late...as in 45+ after our main course was cleared. And were not even offered coffee first. Additionally, I was a little weirded out by the location,,,I am not the biggest fan of feeling like I am in the middle of a mall (oh wait, I was). I think the ambiance could be a smidge better.   Overall, wonderful experience. I'd come back in the future, but by the time I get back out West, I will have another 30 restaurants I'd like to try first.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner the evening of my birthday, because of it's close proximity to Aria, and gorgeous location inside Crystals.   We started with drinks. My BFF got the agave julep which was fresh and tasty, but very sweet. I got the Drunken Pumpkin which was delicious, very flavorful, and not overly sweet. My BF and his BFF ordered a pitcher of beer. After about 10 minutes of the girls having their drinks and the guys waiting, a half pitcher came out because they ran out. They ordered another type of beer, and waited another fifteen minutes for that to come out.   For appetizers, my fatty BFF got the soup appetizer, which was good, but not $12 good. My BF and I shared the insalada mista ($9) with cherry tomatoes and shaved Parmesan, which was good but not extraordinary. They split it for us though, which was nice. The complimentary breads, especially the sourdough, were remarkable. I am a huge sourdough fan, and they sure did it right! It was fluffy and flavorful, and I would have been happy just eating that all night. :)   Our group loves food, so we all at least try, if not share, each others' meal. Our orders, orderers, and ratings:  - Eggplant Parmesan (BFF) (*****)  - Mushroom Pizza (BF's BFF) (****)  - Italian Meat Pizza (BF) (***)  - Swordfish Entree (Bday girl) (**)   My favorites dishes were the eggplant Parmesan and the mushroom pizza. The eggplant was lightly battered and fried, almost tempura-like, and not covered in sauce, but accented with sauce. There was such delicious flavor from the vegetable! The mushroom pizza was really flavorful, and the mushrooms went really well with the combo of sauces and cheese.   The other dishes, the Italian meat pizza and swordfish, were less impressive. Salami sounded good on pizza... turns out it's kind of a weird combination. They were also stingy with the sweet peppers which seemed to be the main source of flavor. I may just stick to pepperonis on my pizza next time. I would advise against the swordfish entree because it was somewhat fishy and a very small portion for $34.   The restaurant shared a complimentary dessert for my birthday, and I chose the tiramisu. It was light and tasty, and had little malt balls mixed in, which was unusual for tiramisu. I, of course, shared it with my best friends and they enjoyed it as well.   Service was good. Not our main waiter, but the back-up waiter (or whatever that title would be) was very helpful, efficient, and attentive. The regular waiter was not bad, but not wonderful.   I would come back here because the ambiance is very unique, the decor is beautiful, and the food was good. It was pricey, but we had a nice dinner together making it worth every penny!",

The food was fantastic, we started with a Prosecco and wanted to keep it light (so we could hit the happy hours later....).  We shared the muscles with Chorizo.  They were perfectly cooked and the chorizo was excellent in the sauce.  Not over powering, just flavorful.  If you like muscles, a MUST TRY.    We then shared a Prosciutto Pizza with Mascarpone Cheese, Arugula & Aged Balsamic.  WOW - Light, flavorful and everything was great together.  I wish I could buy the balsamic they used, not overpowering at all.  The Mascarpone cheese on the pizza was also a nice surprise.  The ingredients were fresh and the food was simple, that's the sign of good Italian food!  I'll definitely try to recreate this at home.    I've eaten at the Airport Wolfgang Puck Express restaurants, Spago and many in between - he's done a great job at keeping the food consistently great at every level.",

I dint know I think I might of missed something because I was not in pressed.   Our party was huge so we had the VIP area. The location is in Crystals which is a very nice upscale shopping center. The service was very good for such a large party. So thumbs up to them.   So lets talk food...my husband and I both ordered pizza. We were both disappointed in the pizza. It was very very plain and lacked that explosion of flavor you would think Wolfgang Puck would have. Our friends ordered lasagna which looked very good. There were also various pasta dishes ordered as well within our party. One thing that surprised me was the potion sizes. They are very small. But I guess you pay for the taste not the size? I was still hungry.  You may like this place. SErvice is great, prices are not to high for the area and you dont need to be to dressy, but that doesnt mean wear flip flops and shorts. And I am sure there is something better than pizza on the menu for your dining experience!!",

I started my meal off with the grilled octopus \"antipasto\" it had a very fresh flavor and was very tender, executed perfectly. Unlike the octopus antipasto, the prosciutto pizza I had  wasn't anywhere near good, the combination of prosciutto, olives and parmesan had an overly salted taste and the olives made it very briny. It was really overwhelming to the taste buds so I only had one piece.  service was slow also, took about 20 mins for our drinks, we ordered beers.",

We had contemplated eating at other restaurants owned by celebrity chefs, however were discouraged with reviews of small portion sizes and the expense. This restaurant I think is an exception! We had an absolutely wonderful, hearty, filling meal for less than $75 (2 entrees, dessert, one glass of wine) which I think is pretty hard to find in Vegas.  I had the rigatoni which was amazing! My husband had the pork scalopinni which was also very, very good. The gellato-so good and creamy. Our waitress was friendly, professional, and gave very good meal suggestions. Would highly recommend!",

Doe this make sense to you?? We have to ask for forks when we ordered pasta and salad?? What kind of service is that?  manager is the biggest joke of all. Doesn't even understand english.

Wish I felt the same excitement for the restaurant itself.  Now, it wasn't bad.  The food was quite good.  We actually went in to get something quick and non-filling, like a nice salad.  I found on the menu a Kale Salad.  It was good, but for 14 bucks, it wasn't THAT good.  And my uncle's 11 dollar bowl of soup simply was not worth the price.  Given all of that, our servers, though nice and friendly, were just not the most attentive waiters.  It took too long to arrive, take our orders and then return.  And this was only during the middle of the day.  It really wasn't that busy. But everyone seemed to be doing quite a bit of running around. Nice place but could use some improvements in customer service, IMO.",

The wood oven pizza that had the perfect crust and just enough wood taste in each bite. I also ordered a salad that was part of the special-- it had plum and nuts... UNREAL! The only complaint I have is that I wasn't a fan of the cheese. I think it was called borgota cheese??? It was a like a very creamy mozzarella? Anyways overall loved this place!",

The food quality etc. here is a little better to what you would find at any California Pizza Factory. There was no \"wow\" factor to our meal, but it was still enjoyable.   Below is what we ordered for two adults:   Wood Fired Oven Pizza  Barbeque Chicken Pizza $16 (I no longer see this item on their menu) It was delicious!   Wood Fired Oven Pizza  Wild Mushroom, Bechamel, Fontina,Thyme, Arugula $14  This pizza was good too...great choice for vegetarians!   Caesar Salad Creamy Garlic Dressing, Parmesan Croutons, White Anchovies $12  Overall, The food was better than the service. The service was below average in my honest opinion. It wasn't busy when we went, yet we constantly had to flag down the server when we needed something because he never bothered  to check on us or refill our drinks etc. once the food was served. We would probably give them another chance as the food was good, and it's conveniently located in the Crystals.",

    "text": "If you're looking for an excuse to go to Crystals and actually spend money on something there, you can thank Wolfgang Puck for making it possible.  Now, if you really want to hardly spend anything, there is also The Pods by Wolfgang Puck right beneath it, but I'd opt for the Pizzeria & Cucina.  The big question I had before going here was: is it better to go here, or the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at the MGM?  After now having gone to both, I'd much rather go here.  The ambience is far superior here, it's totally better to be at Crystals looking around than basically next to the casino floor at MGM.  I opted to sit at the bar, where it is happy hour all day and I felt like I could relax there all day. The bartender/server was helpful, personable, and even made a recommendation that helped save me money (he basically told me to just refill up on regular tea for free, as opposed to the one I ordered which costs $4 w/ no free refills).  Although I sat at the bar, there's a great variety of seating options all around, I'm a real fan of this layout, especially the white couch/booth.  My favorite thing I had was the Zeppole (see pic), even after eating all that food I was able to finish these 6 donut holes. When it was set in front of me, I thought there was no way I had room left for it all, but they were so good that I did!  They really do taste best if you put the caramel and gelato on them at the same time.  Their Spicy Pepperoni wood fired oven pizza is hard to resist too.   Easily one of the most awesome affordable places to go on The Strip for a meal or just snacks and drinks.",

I was like no TY since the linguini was already 14 dollars..... I  also didnt like the fact that they had happy hour but in order to get happy hour you had to sit at the bar. I mean my group was like 8 people and there was no way we wanted to sit at the bar AND eat food. I guess they're just losing business.  The bread was good though!",

Salmon pizza (with caviar) --very delicious, smoke and regular salmon topping, well balance. But you have to drink lots of water afterward. Bolognese pasta --decent pasta.

This restaurant is located inside the Crystals shopping center on the 2nd floor. You get a nice view of the shopping area too. Fancy! We were seated right away and our order was taken by the manager. Nice to know he participates. Sadly they ran out of the duck pizza. We ended up with the mushroom pizza instead.   I had the salmon with potato puree. It was lovely. Cooked perfectly still juicy and so so flavorful. My mouth was in love and wanted more. I enjoyed their complimentary bread too. Hands down the best bread I've had. Fluffy and bouncy on the inside and crunchy crisp on the outside. More please!   The pizza was so so which was sad to say since this place is supposed to be a pizzeria. They had 4 different kinds of mushrooms which was impressive, but the flavors did not excite my taste buds or put me on the edge for more. The bf had the same thought as well. Too bad we couldn't try the duck.   Tip: check out the Tickets4Less booths along the strip. They sell discounts to restaurants and can make reservations for you! We got 20% off the whole bill for $4.",

    "text": "Located inside Crystals Mall, Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina offers a gorgeous yet inviting dining room, as well as a modern and chic bar and lounge scene. The restaurant's orientation offer's a bird's eye view of the Crystals Mall, but if you want something more intimate, opt for the interior dining.   The menu is clearly Italian-influenced, with choices like Italian pizzas, salads, pastas & paninis. They also have authentic appetizers such as Italian salumi (San Daniele Prosciutto, my ultimate fav...not easy to find in the U.S) , Grilled Octopus, and Prime Beef Carpaccio. The fine selection they have really demonstrated the authenticity the restaurant brings forth.   Prices are reasonable, so this is a great option if you aren't looking to drop money as if you were dining at Joel Robuchon. The food is definitely well-prepared and nicely presented. The wine list is also solid, with options from both the US and Italy. Glasses are reasonably priced at $8-$12 range.   My most memorable thing here was the dessert- Italian Doughnuts - the Zeppole. I haven't had Zeppole in the states in ages..so this was a delectable and pleasant surprise! Paired with caramel dipping sauce and vanilla gelato - this makes for an outstanding dessert to share! They're fluffy and light, and not overly sweet (comparable to French Beignets).   There a number of reputable Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. Many renowned chefs have opened restaurants on the strip -Mario Batali, most notably for Carnevino in the Palazzo and B&B in the Venetian, Valentino's in the Venetian, Bartolotta in the Wynn - the list is really very extensive. But, if you want to eat somewhere that is appropriate for a casual lunch, a glass of wine in the afternoon, or a solid dinner meal -this is your go-to place for any occasion. The hospitality and service will also impress you.",

They have a special menu that we did order from which was a deal so I'm not sure if our service was based on us ordering from that menu because we did notice party at table close to us was getting great service. I am hoping it's not because we were a table of hispanics and they weren't... anyhoo food was salty and service bad and when we complained they offered 20% off bill which I just noticed is offered to everyone on this yelp site.

He said it was a hip and trendy rustic Italian restaurant. He also said the decor didn't match the current feel because originally the restaurant was a brasserie.  I didn't get the intended vibe at all. The music was too too loud and killed any sort of enjoyable dining experience a diner could have. For a slow night, the service was slow and the bartender was not attentive. The support staff serving the food were more helpful.   I did appreciate how the managers took it upon themselves to seat guests and take orders. No task too small.  As for the food itself:  Sliders- teeny tiny and too salty Meatballs- just average Chicken wings- had a kick of heat and were crispy and delicious!  Bread- you can get it for free with your order, you just need to ask.",

The panini was basically a piece of bread with bits and bobs of cheese and pork. The bread was okay, and it wasn't toasted/pressed properly.

    "text": "I was less than impressed and honestly think this place needs an overhaul.  Initially a manager greeted me and served me a glass of wine.  He seemed attentive and I had high hopes.   He quickly disappeared and it s went downhill from there.  I was sitting at the POS station at the bar, which I thought may mean I would be noticed.  Oddly, no one even looked up while at that station unless I went out of my way to get their attention.  It took a while to get my order placed.   I wound up ordering two appetizers, the octopus and crab salad sliders, which were recommended by the bartender. I specifically asked for them to be served individually, one as the actual appetizer followed by the next as my main course, they came out together.   The octopus was good.  I was disappointed the pea puree was maybe 1 teaspoon smeared, more for presentation than for balance on the dish.  It was good and complimented the octopus, however there wasn't enough and I ate most of the octopus dry and alone.  It was well prepared otherwise.   The crab salad slider NOT SO MUCH! They weren't edible, in my opinion.  I cut the first slider in four small bites, had the first one and the only thing I tasted was mayonnaise.  Literally little to NO flavor.  I wish I had taken a picture, the white salad doesn't even look appetizing.   I left everything on that plate.  Which my bartender/server did finally remove, but never even acknowledged I didn't eat anything from that plate.    $60 later, I met a very interesting gentleman who lives upstairs in a condo with his wife.  He explained to me the turnover there is off the charts and the menu is changing regularly and getting worse all the time.  He said they used to eat there 3 times a week, now they come maybe once a week.    Also, they have all day happy hour so my Chardonnay was only $5 and actually pretty good.    I wouldn't come back here.  Except for maybe a cheap glass of wine.    I wanted to give 3 stars because I enjoyed the wine, company and octopus.  I decided to give a 2 because the service was not good, and the sliders even worse.",

Long story short, my gf and I ended up here by chance cause we were hungry and too lazy to walk anywhere else, plus we saw a restaurant and decided to try it. We were a bit out of place since we look like kids (stupid Asian gene) and look all \"roughed up\" while everyone else look rich and fancy. Besides the point, we loved our waiter. I can't remember his name, but he was very nice and patient with us. When we had questions about our food, he knew exactly what to answer.

We ordered the branzino for 2 and when we tracked down our server to ask when our food was coming, we were told they were going to take pictures of it first,  then give it to us.  We were concerned about it being cold and he told us they under cooked it so they could finish cooking it after the photos, meanwhile we it's almost an hour and we are still waiting for our food.  Unbelievable that the service at such a nice restaurant can be this bad.  The food doesn't even have a chance after this experience!!!",

    "text": "Last lunch before leaving Vegas, and did not disappoint! I made lunch reservations not knowing if they were going to be busy. They weren't on a weekday and we were led to a nice table overlooking the mall. Cucina is located inside Crystals and a very short walk from Aria's entrance which made the trip even more convenient.  They have a great 3-course lunch special for $25 to include an appy, entree, and a small dessert. Great price esp for it being in the strip and inside Crystals.  We were given bread and olive oil/ vinegar to munch on, and I ordered the following: -Shrimp scampi ($5 extra): The 3 shrimp were large and the flavors of the garlic and lemon were on par. I loved how they included bread so you can use it to dip into the sauce! YUM!!! -Ravioli (no peas): I enjoyed my entree. It was a white light sauce used and it was the perfect kind. Not too heavy and not too creamy. I didn't care for the white asparagus but the mushrooms were good. -Tiramisu: Small dessert and not overbearing. It was the perfect amount to finish off a lunch. I also tried my friends Vanilla Zeppole (donut holes) and they were good - sugar coated donuts.  Our service was great and we were checked on frequently. Waters were filled and the ambiance was cool. Loved how there is a strip restaurant that is reasonably priced!",

Thank goodness we saw the pre-fixe options here when we walked through the mail earlier in our trip.  There was a great variety to choose from in the pre-fixe menu. I went with the minestrone soup, chicken, and dessert. The soup was very mild and could have used a little more flavor. My main entree was very yummy! Cooked and paired well with the pasta. As for dessert, donut holes with dipping sauce.  All not bad for the price. Overall great experience. Service was good. Nice location in the mall.",

For entrees, we tried the ravioli and linguine frutti di mare. Both were really flavorful and something we would order again. Two us tried the sea bass. It was good, not great. It's served with briccolini and sausage.  The service was very slow and inattentive. My water glass was empty 3 times. It also took 40 minutes to get our entrees.  Overall, I think they excel in their pastas. Service is slow and a bit frustrating but still a good option for pretty good food in the strip.",

I tend to walk around my chair when I get a dish that is tasty, well here, I walked around the bar... TWICE!  I went for lunch and they have this great deal for a prix-fix for $25. Choice of three appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 dessert. The fact that I'm writing this review after the entree, means that I know dessert is going to be stellar.  I started with the prosciutto which was accompanied with a burrata which was to die for. Very creamy served at the right temperature.  The entree I went for basil ravioli. I don't know what it was filled with, but I do know that I cleaned my plate... The sauce, the filling, everything was just great.  Now I just did my third lap around the bar after I tasted my tiramisu. Light and delicious, perfectly balanced.  Did I mention everything is dirt cheap compared to other \"good\" restaurants in Vegas? Prosecco for $9, all entrees below $30.  Sherlynn was a great bartender. Easy to talk to, sweet and on point  For a moment, you think your no longer in a mall, but it brings your senses to Italy. They should change the interior and music a little to match the Italian lifestyle",

I got both of the sangrias and shared a plate of wings and tiramisu. I was not a fan of either sangrias but if I had to choose, I preferred the white one because the sprite complimented it much better than the red. I'm not a fan of carbonated sangrias and almost wished I asked about it before ordering.  The wings however were delicious! Reminiscent of the seasoning in Thai MAMA noodles. They were fried to perfection and was properly seasoned! The tiramisu was a little disappointing. I get that HH food is usually smaller portions with less effort but this baby tasted like it was popped out of its packaging and stuck on a plate.   All in all, it was an okay happy hour. I'd love to come back to actually dine in to see if the experience is different.",

We were intrigued by the \"all day\" happy hour which is either not really a happy hour anymore or it's a happy day. Which one is it? Hmmm...  We ordered the chicken wings ($7) which were very crispy and who doesn't like crispy wings? I was a big fan of the negroni and I should've kept ordering that. I decided to switch it up and order the Moscow mule next and was not a fan of it. It tasted mostly like ginger beer with no vodka at all.  My girlfriend ordered both their red and white sangrias and she was not a fan of either. I tried it and we agreed that they were both overly carbonated with too much soda. That seems like a trend with some of the carbonated drinks here.  We ended our meal with the tiramisu hoping that it could salvage our experience with the food here but it didn't help. Overall it's just a meh happy hour and you can probably find better options in Vegas.",

Minus another half star for Wolfgang's red wine. Spend the money to get some better tasting sips. Service was good. Thank you, Yelper Phil The check-in bonus is substantial for saving you some money to get a better wine. Did I mention the wine? It isn't bad.

An elegant setting overlooking the Crystal mall and great service made for a delightful lunch. The mushroom pizza was wood fired, but not blistered and scorched, as inattentive cooks can sometimes end up with. My ravioli was so beautifully plated that I thought it was arriving for a phot shoot. I almost didn't want to disturb the careful pasta placement! So found it a tad over salted, though. Straw mushrooms were a nice touch. I asked for the bread and you should, too: 4 pieces of moist focaccia and sliced, crusty Italian bread. I would normally have ordered wine but the wine list, heavy on Puck's brand, looked lackluster. But on the specialty cocktails was a barrel aged Negroni that was more than an adequate replacement!",

But I was jonesing for a spaghetti carbonara and after a quick Yelp search, Cucina was at the right place at the right time.  and WOW, talk about surpassing expectations!  Their rendition of a pasta carbonara is the Torchio, which had recently changed and differed than the pics/reviews on Yelp.  I probably would have preferred the original version (with peas), but this dish was very very good.    But the real MVP was the Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu.  It was ***spectacular*** (sent with fireworks).  The pasta was delicate and perfect, the sauce was delicious, the meat tender.  If it had a little less salt, it would have been flawless.  Portions are not over-sized like at most restaurants so the entrees might seem small to some people, but these two dishes are worth every cent.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention... they have a Yelp check-in discount - 20%!  I will definitely be back!",

The service: attentive and knowledgeable  2. The food. So many great options that even if they aren't on the menu they will offer to make it for you. 3. Environment and atmosphere: very sophisticated and posh   I would recommend the spaghetti it was so good. The pizza, goat cheese platter and ravioli are also good.",

We were looking for a nice relaxing place to eat before the Britney Spears show and we're able to get a last minute reservation on a Saturday night.   After hitting up a buffet for breakfast that same day,  I was looking for something light and flavorful. I ordered the minestrone soup and a salad with peaches and tomatoes. Both dishes were great,  but I really enjoyed the salad.  The prices were reasonable, the menu was well-rounded and the service was quick and attentive.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is calm and serene, the decorations are appropriate, servers are nice and the quality of the food is what you would expect from Wolfgang Puck. The major problem I have here is with using the discount cards that are affiliated with this restaurant and the managerial staff's lack of acknowledgement for such.   My wife and I came in to have lunch and ordered from their prix fixe lunch menu. Halfway through our meal, we were told that the 30% off discount we showed our waiter would not apply to that menu since the prices were fixed before. Typically I understand this, but when this is not advertised and is the sole reason why you purchased the card, this mistake should not fall on the cost of the consumer. Technically, this can be classified as entrapment, as we were given no fair warning of a selective discount, and not one single printed advertisement says discounts cannot be applied.   When speaking with management, we were told they \"don't control what the vendors write\" (even though multiple other restaurants have restrictions printed on the same ad), and \"we need to go to the website for the fine print\" (who does that, and how would we know to do that?) I've done advertising before, I've been in management before- trust me, you've got a lot more control in what's printed because it's technically illegal to have a vendor Falsely advertise for you including rearrangement of context and content of advertisements.  This is very unfortunate because the quality of the food we reluctantly paid full price for was excellent, and the staff working there who have no say in the advertising were sublime. I do recommend coming here, but be forewarned if you carry any of the discount cards. My review stands, at least until they can correct their mistake and not blame the consumer for their advertising oversight.",

    "text": "We had our final night's dinner in Las Vegas here at his location at The Aria on The Strip. It was our anniversary and they comped us an Apple Crostata with Happy Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate which we thought was a very nice touch.  But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.  First, the location.... The restaurant itself is located on the upper floor of an elegant luxury shopping mall fronting the Aria Hotel and Casino. The mall is magnificent with many, many high end stores offering some of the finest items one can imagine.  We had a 6PM reservation but arrived a half hour early which presented no problem for the hostesses. We found the decor to be modern, hip and yet elegant. They seated  us at a table at the edge of the restaurant which overlooked the shops below.  Service was excellent with the waiters, servers and bus staff being attentive but not intrusive.  Bread and oil with Balsamic vinegar was promptly brought to the table while we perused the menu.  We began by sharing the Cauliflower Soup (which my wife said was the best she had ever tasted) and the Eggplant Parmigiana appetizer. These were followed by our main courses. I had the Salmon Steak which was presented over mashed potatoes while my wife had their Osso Buco which she said was excellent and perfectly prepared.  We finished with the aforementioned dessert.  Only two things detracted from our experience. The first was the water that was first brought to the table had a somewhat \"fishy\" or \"soapy\" taste but the bottled still water which was brought afterwards was tasteless as it should have been from the start.  The other minor faux pas was that they failed to provide a small \"marrow spoon\" so that my wife could extract more of the marrow.  All things considered, this restaurant is a solid 4 Stars and we will return on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

The tomatoes tasted so fresh and the ingredients blended so well together. definitely recommend!  - soppressata (pizza): $17, soooo good! I'm not a huge fan of salami but the pizza was so delicious I didn't mind at all.  - rigatoni (pasta): $20, definitely good for sharing. My group also got the pappardelle which was also good, but if you are looking for something for tomato sauce based, I would go for the ravioli.   - bistecca for 2 (daily specials): $79, also highly recommend!! The order came out a little more rare than expected (we asked for medium rare), so keep that in mind if you're ordering this. The meat is so soft and rich, I was sold after one bite! Comes with potatoes and broccolini, from what I remember.   Overall this place has GREAT ambiance, GREAT service, and GREAT food. Good for groups or with another person- if you're coming with one other person, I'd recommend a pizza and pasta to share. Thanks for a great experience! I will definitely come back next time.",

They carry an all-day-everyday happy hour at the bar, and there's a variety of small plates and bigger dishes & cocktails ranging from $4-$16.  We decided to pass on the hh and split the eggplant and garlic spinach pizza with an add of chicken, $20. The mozzarella was light so the pizza didn't feel heavy to eat. The pieces of white meat chicken were delicious - perfectly seasoning with a subtle smoky flavor. The spinach, slightly crisp, had a mild garlic flavor that wasn't too overpowering. While the eggplant was tender, it was a little watery and lacked seasoning. That would probably be my only complaint, in addition to perhaps wishing the pizza was a little crispier. Either way the pizza makes for a simple, delicious meal that's perfect for sharing.  Service was very nice. All of the staff was very attentive without hovering too much. Wolfgang makes a perfect stop to refuel between stores.",

By picky eater, I mean the full range from \"kid palate\" to vegan to full-on celiac.  This restaurant always manages to please everyone, and I had such a good experience this last time, I wonder why I don't go here more on my own.  So the last time I was here was with a group of 7 (4 adults and 3 kids).  We walked in without a reservation and the restaurant was able to seat us right away.  That alone merits a couple of stars.  The gluten-free, dairy-free adult in our group was happy with her chicken entree.  The gluten-free, dairy-free kid liked his pizza.  The adult who can eat gluten, but avoids meat, enjoyed his pizza.  The other two kids loved their pizzas.  I don't even know what my husband ate, but it was devoured.  My salmon on a bed of legumes was to die for.  I washed it down with some sangria which was wonderfully refreshing.  The restaurant just nailed everything, from the food to the drinks to the service.  The location in the Crystals Mall is delightfully airy.  It's a welcome reprieve from the chaos of the strip and the smokiness of the casinos.",

We quickly made a reservation, since we got to the hotel and checked in with just enough time to grab food and head over to MGM Grand to get our tickets for the JT concert that night. There were no problems getting reservations with such short notice.   The hostess was extremely friendly. She seated us right away and made small talk. When she and our waiter heard we were going to the concert, they assured us they would expedite our food and make sure we got out of there as soon as possible. They weren't kidding! The service was so fast that we ended our meal with a little time to spare and had time to finish our drinks and relax for a bit.   As far as drinks go, we ordered some dirty vodka martinis, and they were great! super strong and dirty enough to not realize how strong they were!   For our meals, we split the eggplant parmesan and the Roasted eggplant, garlic spinach, and fresh mozzarella pizza. Both meals were absolutely delicious and they were the perfect portions - we were full AND didn't have to worry about leftovers. Even the pasta that the eggplant parm came with was delicious!   Overall, had a great experience. Would definitely go back if I was staying on the strip next time!",

My girlfriend has a severe gluten allergy, and Quetzi walked us through everything on the menu and checked on the specials to be sure that they could be prepared gluten-free.  I do not eat GF, but we ordered everything GF that night, and I can confidently say that gluten-free diners will love Cucina.  We started with the Piccollo antipasti plate, and it was a pretty sizable portion that makes a great appetizer for two (but could probably accommodate three as well). The bread, which is about the only thing Cucina did not have a GF option for, is outstanding. The meats, cheeses and olive tapenade were all great.  The Ensalata pizza on a GF crust was great. Crispy but not dry, it had a great basil pesto sauce with some acid added from a little red wine vinegar. The greens on top were fresh and delicious.  Cucina only had gluten-free rigatoni as a pasta option that night, but it was scratch-made in house. It was incredible. My girlfriend said it was the best pasta she's ever had since being forced to alter her diet more than seven years ago. I would never have known it was GF pasta. It was cooked to perfection, and the Manila clams, shrimp and calamari that accompanied it were delicious and perfectly cooked.  We also had Cucina's house Pinot Noir (from Wolfgang's own label), which we got free with a MyVegas voucher. It was delicious, with hints of cherry and cocoa.  I cannot recommend Cucina enough. Everything about our experience was worthy of five stars.",

We got the meatballs as an appetizer and they were great! Every entree we ordered came out great and even better than we expected. I loved the setting of the restaurant also because we could watch people wander around the Crystals mall. If you come here make sure you go to the restroom to check it out, it's definitely different and a very cool design!",

    "text": "The price/quality/location combo for Wolfgang's gem in Crystals is hard to beat. For that reason alone I had to go with the full 5/5.   Our party of three was looking for some good food at a not outrageous price, and at a location that was nice but didn't require us to be dressed to the nines. If you're looking for the same, this is for you.   The table bread was, in a word, delicious. Our entrees (lamb pesto, veal scallopini, italian sea bass) were the best specimens of each that either of us ever had. In particular, the sea bass was out of this world (crispy skin, tender and flaky meat - just wow) as were the polenta and lamb.  Service was impeccable and the ambiance was nice, overlooking the lower floor of Crystals. Only oddity was the bathroom, with the common sink and M/F labelled separate toliets.   Entrees were $18-30, salads and appetizers $10-15 - incredibly reasonable for the location and quality. Make a reservation now via Yelp/OpenTable, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "Certainly one of my favorite restaurants on the strip! (And it won't break the bank!)  The service was awesome. I'm not sure of my server's name but he was a nice guy who was very attentive and really kind. I was surprised not to see him blow up after trying to handle a major language barrier while trying to take a drink order. I would've lost it and gave up, but he was nice enough to work with the party next to our table.  I came in with my girl and her sister to enjoy a nice dinner so we stopped here because Wolfgang's restaurants are always consistent. We started with the bruschetta, fried rice balls, and calamari. They were all amazing. Calamari was perfect and tasted fantastic. The pesto bruschetta was one of the best I've ever had and the fried rice balls were out of control delicious. Outstanding flavor in such a small ball.    We also ordered a mushroom pizza, just because i was so eager to try it. It was amazing. Great mushrooms and the pizza was done perfectly! We each had a slice and took the rest home. Moving further, I ordered the beef lasagne, my girl ordered the SeaBass (substituted for something different) and our third ordered the Veal lasagna. All were great, although my girlfriend was little disappointed that the menu description didn't include olives or the tomato sauce that was under the description of her entree. She's not a fan of either. She said the fish was just OK. But was pretty much already stuffed from the appetizers.  Shockingly, we found room for dessert and ordered the fresh Strawberry cake thing? and the tiramisu. I'm not a fan of fruit in my desserts but I was told it was delicious and the tiramisu was amazing. The light crunch in the tiramisu was unlike anything I've ever tried and really closed the meal out great for me.  Overall, I know I'll be back. This restaurant is one of the best Wolfgang Pucks in town and certainly the best option inside of Crystals shopping center. (Unless you want to spend $75/person at Mastro's)",

As we all got our food after the others returned, they assumed their orders were still being prepared. 10-15 min later, we had to wave the server down to check on the orders as well as refill our glasses. He comes back to tell us that their orders were never placed and forgets to get us more water on top of that.

So on our last night we headed over towards Aria and had gluten free pizza at this awesome place. The restaurant is located in a mall between the Aria and Cosmo, which is probably the only negative because it doesn't offer any cool views of the hotels or the Strip. But the food was worth it. We shared 3 pizzas and a dish of pasta- we were five super hungry, sunburned and recently pizza-deprived girls. Oh and we started with a burrata and prosciutto appetizer. Everything was delicious, Wolfgang definitely knows how to make great gluten free pasta and pizza crust. Perfect amount of chewiness, even my non-gluten free friends thought it tasted like the real deal.  We split just a basic tomato based rigatoni pasta, but it was so good for being so simple. And then had a tomato basil, Italian meat and sausage/broccolini pizza. I think my favorite was the the tomato basil but all three were great, I was surprised that the sausage and broccolini flavors complimented each other and totally worked. I tend to like more veggie pizza versus meat, which is why I liked the first one best but meat lovers would be more than pleased with the options here. Can't wait to come back and indulge in this pizza again the next time I'm in Vegas!",

I came here between lunch and dinner, and not surprisingly, it wasn't busy, so I sat at the bar. They have a happy hour menu, but despite the name, it's actually available all day, seven days a week.  To start, I had a glass of the red wine sangria, which was wonderfully sweet. It ended up being one of the best-tasting sangrias I've ever had. For an appetizer, I tried the grilled pork belly with balsamic glaze. Quite small, but I loved how it was so tender on the inside with a crunchy exterior. For my main entree, I had a half order of spaghetti and meatballs. Some of the pasta dishes are available in a half size, so just ask. Spaghetti and meatballs seem so simple, but they did it perfectly! They also gave me complimentary bread with butter and red pepper flakes when asked.   The bartender was attentive, and service was excellent overall. Really enjoyed my experience here!",

The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. I ordered off the prie fixe menu and highly recommend the artichoke bruschetta and salmon. Definitely grab dinner here if you have the chance!",

We were given the bar menu in addition to the regular menu which had good deals on pizzettes and appetizers. Waiter Tony was very friendly and professional. The pizzette was maybe two inches smaller radius than a pizza for half the price. The pasta was fantastic, fresh made noodles, perfect Bolognese sauce and real shredded beef. I would make this my first choice for Italian on the strip.",

The atmosphere was casual, the services was friendly and quick, and the food left me craving for more.

We cleaned up the plates and did not leave any food left on the plates..The food was good the first time and even better the second time. But more importantly we were treated like VIPS and i just want to thank Evan and his staff for making that happen..thks Evan. We will definitely be returning soon.",

Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.  Overall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.  Sampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.  Even though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats.",

We took a break from window shopping (the only thing you can really do at the stores here), and had a really nice lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria. The ultra modern restaurant is open and airy, located in the middle of the mall.   While no one in our group of four ladies was particularly starving, we just got three things to share. I guess the motivation behind that was the skin tight size XS dress that was waiting to be worn a few hours later. So, we ordered the fried calamari appetizer, one basil pesto grilled chicken panini and the calzone pizza which we had them make as an open faced flat pizza. They were kind enough to cut the panini into fours, and surprisingly, we still had leftover pizza! Loved the delicious panini, and the thin crust pizza was very tasty. The calamari was nicely fried and not oily at all.  Service was top notch here. I'm really starting to notice the high level of hospitality in Vegas, which is pretty refreshing. Will definitely be back to do do some casual dining when I'm staying at Vdara. The bar area is also super swank with TVs projected onto a piece of glass. Nice job, Wolfie.",

Then I had the citrus marinated beet salad with goat cheese. Divine! Best salad that I have ever had! My partner had the radish cucumber salad which he said was a little plain (thus only 4 stars). Now for the incredible entrees... I had eggplant Parmesan which was simply incredible, it was served with a pasta which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy, garlicky. Yummy! My partner had the rigatoncini with Piemontese meat sauce and he said it was delicious! And to top it off, our drinks were perfectly made each time.  We didn't order any speciality cocktails but stuck with out favorites; a greyhound and Jack and Coke.  Of course, I must mention the service... I was satisfied.

We ordered drinks, apps and entrees, all of which we have zero complaints. The wings were CRISPY and delicious! We loved them! The Caesar salad came with anchovies, I'm sure you can request it without, but I don't mind them.  I got the raviolis, the large order, which in my opinion wasn't very large. They also were not filled enough and weren't pillow-like. They seemed to be off in the cheese to dough ratio. They were more flat and I believe it was simply because they were a) under filled and/or b) made with mozzarella cheese vs ricotta. Mozzarella melts differently than ricotta, which could have also contributed to the flatness of the ravioli. But otherwise they were delicious. But who couldn't use more cheese??! :-) Overall it was a great price for a nice relaxing dinner to break up the day.  $70 (before tip) for a pitcher of sangria, meat and cheese board, Caesar salad, wings, and raviolis. Not bad. We will be back to try new things.",

The food for me was almost five stars - the only reason why I didn't give this review five stars was that I really didn't like the antipasto salad that came out with our mains - that was a really disappointment. The bruschetta was amazing, beautiful pesto & balsamic flavours - just stunning! I ordered the veal ravioli and it was beautiful - the sauce was amazing with the mushrooms, it was a great order. My husband had the ox tail Ragu - also really yummy. We had a great night and a very positive experience here - definitely try it out!!",

Had to get something a bit on the low fat side (high fat intolerance).  The Italian Sausage pizza did the trick.  The roasted garlic added a certain kick to the pizza & didn't over-empower the dish.  There was constantly someone walking around to see if customers were happy.  Love, love, love that!  I got a ginger lime soda or tea of some sort.  Sooo delish!  The food came a bit out late, but was well worth it.  The food is a bit pricey, but worth every penny for the fresh ingredients & the well balanced dishes.  Ambience was cool & airy.",

I liked how I made a reservation online while standing outside the restaurant; yay points!  Anyway, I read fellow Yelpers' reviews sounded and it sounded promising although I usually avoid Wolfgang Puck's restaurants (haven't had a good track record.) For starters, the service was sub-par; yes I understand it's Christmas Eve but common, 40 minutes for thin crust pizza. The people around us came in later and were on dessert when we got our food. (Side note: the salad and calamari appetizer; YUM; came very promptly.) Then it took forever to get the check, then even longer for the receipt. Plus the manager went around to ask other tables how their meals were and to wish them happy holidays but not us.   Sorry I digress, back to food. The pizza was not very tasty. The prosciutto was so bland and the lamb chorizo was...okay. Sadly I will not be back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here on New Year's Eve. Before I came, I perused the online menu and was pretty set on ordering a pizza. Based on the restaurant's name, I thought that would be a good choice. When I got the menu, the veal tagliolini, a New Year's Eve special, caught my eye as did the $32 price tag but it was New Year's Eve so I went for it. It was plentiful and DELICIOUS! The veal was super tender and the tomato sauce drizzled with pesto was oh so tasty.   Boyfriend ordered and liked the turf (ribeye) and surf (prawns), which was $45. I tried the prawns and thought it was okay. I didn't try the ribeye, but the steak was big, at least 16 ounces. The turf and surf came with roasted potatoes and it was yummy. The potatoes were well seasoned, the skin was perfectly crisped and the inside was cooked perfectly.   We also shared a caesar salad ($14) which was very good and could have been split 4 ways there was so much. What I liked best was they used romaine spears and fresh shredded parmesan. The dressing was also top notch.  To pair with our food, we ordered a pear drink and a bellini. I preferred the pear drink. There was also complimentary bread and butter. The bread was warm and the butter was creamy. Very nice. Finally, our waiter was attentive but not bothersome.   The bill after tip came out to be $146. Our bill was high because we splurged, but this place is actually very affordable. Most entrees are $16-25.   It was a good experience and I would go back.",

I guess I have a higher expectation because of the Wolfgang Puck name. I was hoping to see some creative pizza and pasta combination.   The lasagna was good, it was light, meaty and delicate without a heavy tomato sauce. It was worth $19.  The sweet corn pizza was a bit disappointing. The dough tasted like frozen pizza dough and there were not enough seasoning to bring the flavors out. I enjoyed a frozen pizza more from Trader Joe's.   Plus, our waiter was very pushy trying to get us to order more food. I mean...this is Vegas, doesn't everyone have 5 small meals a day?",

The server was nice, although I forgot her name. The food took for-ev-errrrrrr to get out to us. The eggplant parmesan (my dish) was a-ok. My cousin had the mushroom pizza, which was OK, as well. I am a huge fan of arugula and when her pizza came out, the mushroom was baked within the pizza as it usually is, and the arugula was just sprinkled on top with what looked like olive oil sprinkled over it. She wasn't happy. I think she was expecting it to be baked with the whole pizza, but whatever. I ate it all anyway. Another one of my friends ordered a pepperoni pizza sub pepperoni for chicken, because they don't pork. The server was kind enough to do that, however failed to tell her that there would be an extra charge for chicken. One would think since you're subbing the item, it would be an equal exchange if you weren't notified of a price difference. We didn't want to complain or argue, so we just paid the difference and left it at that.  Everyone left the restaurant unhappy and with complaints. Bad sign. We probably won't come here again next time.",

They also split the salad for us which was a nice gesture.  Both pizzas were very tasty, we had the Mushroom and the spicy pepperoni.  However the spicy was not spicy at all.  I would have provided 4 stars but our food took forever.  I think it was a kitchen screw up but the hostess should have noticed and provided a simple apology.",

We ordered some mild prosciutto as a starter, we received about 9 thinly sliced pieces, along with some olives and bread. Quite tasty. For our main we split the yukon gold potato pizza. We eat a lot of pizza, and this was probably one of the best we've had at a restaurant. It was a thin crust, so all the flavor came from its ingredients. The mascarpone and thinly sliced potatoes combined with the greens and guanciale (pork cheek) was the perfect combination of slightly sweet and savory. The servers were very attentive and kept our water glasses full throughout our meal. The total with tip was under $30. Very reasonable for a tasty Vegas meal.",

I went with the gnocchi, which I read rave reviews about, and it was delicious.  The bread, of course, was great, too.

My friend ended up sending her fish back, but it took so long for it to come back out that i was finishing mine. at this point we were both so tired and she wasn't hungry anymore that we just sent it back in.

I was leisurely eating, trying to wait for her food to come out... and we were talking the whole time.  definitely not a place I'm too willing to go back to.",

That said, their wood-grilled salmon was lush (not sure why they choose Scottish over fabulous American alternatives - and I'm a Brit myself!) and everything was so fresh.

The restaurant is simple yet classy. I love how they project old B&W films on the back wall near the bar, definitely different from anything I've seen at ANY pizzeria!  We started off with the Caesar salad and fried calamari. The calamari tasted surprisingly light, it was the best I've ever had. It also came with 3 different dipping sauces that varied from the Mild to Spicy type spectrum.  I ordered the lasagna and was not disappointed at all because it just felt so homemade and was well balanced in regard to cheese, herbs and meat. My boyfriend got the veal and mushroom ravioli and said he enjoyed it. Didn't end up getting dessert cause I was already stuffed and super satisfied.  I would definitely want to come back to try their other dishes! This was a perfect, random find.",

After a CRAZY long day of walking in 100+ degree weather all the way down the strip trying to save taxi money, we figured SCREW IT, WE DESERVE A DAMN GOOD MEAL. Okay, in all honesty, it was probably only me that didn't want to take the taxi but after that day I realized that public transportation is definitely worth it.   ANYWAYS, I ordered the ravioli with porcini mushrooms, brown butter, sage/pepper sopresatta sweet peppers! The name sounded fancy so I decided to give it a try! It was a little pricey but it's probably the cheapest of all the WP restaurants around. The ravioli were delicious, I preferred them over the cheese ones that my friend ordered. We also had a few pizzas at our table, and all these dishes were definitely big enough to be shared by two (at lunch) !! Servers were great, my only complaints are that the sun was pretty much blinding me during half of the meal, and the cute but tiny fizzy drink that I ordered was definitely not worth the 6+ dollars that I probably paid for it.  Definitely a great lunch spot! :)",

    "text": "Had two meals here during our stay. Both were very good. Sometimes with restaurants associated with well known chefs can kind of be hit or miss especially when said chef is not on the premise and has MANY restaurants nationwide. This location of Wolfgang Puck happily bucks this trend.  The kale salad is super yummy as is the antipasto salad (although I ate around the salami) we shared a pizza (basically because we had our eye on dessert) although you could pretty easily consume one all by yourself.  The tiramisu was very artfully plated and different than many preparations I have had.   The four cheese ravioli is really yummy as well. The wine/cocktail list is fun.",

    "text": "Vegas restaurants are usually a hit or miss; most of the time mid-priced restaurants are more a miss since they are often overpriced and their food is mediocre at best. However, this place was a pleasant surprise. The prices were higher because they were on the Strip but the food was delicious and the service was so attentive and friendly. Plus, apparently they have a happy hour at their bar that I failed to miss but their dining room service was great for me.   Mussels appetizer: This was DELICIOUS! The mussels are good but the sauce is what made this go from \"pretty good\" to \"omg delicious\" Plus, it was a generous amount that was good for the two of us there.   Lam Chorizo Pizza: Pretty good, loaded the top with lots of stuff and really flavorful   Mushroom Ravioli with Goat Cheese: YUM!! I love that it came with dozens of regular size pieces--I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give you 3 giant pieces of ravioli which you have to cut up at eat. This was really good and left me really full.   Caramelized Brussel Sprouts: True story--I've never had brussel sprouts before because Asian families don't serve it at home but the waitress kept raving about how these were better than what most people hate. First impression--it's not bad but it's not great. I'm sure it tasted better than the regular kind but ehhh I'll pass on this next time.   Good choice if you're not feeling like getting dressed up and emptying out your wallet for the fancier places but want to eat at a nice place.

After having a drink and great conversation with the staff we decided to have dinner as well.   We started off with the charcuterie board which was solid. Bread, meat and cheeses were fresh and plentiful. For entrees My wife ordered the bolognese and I ordered the torchio (a carbonara dish). Prior to ordering our server told us he would put their pasta dishes up against any in Vegas and after trying them I would, too. Our dishes were opposite from each other so we had a broad spectrum of their pasta dishes. Both were phenomenal. It would be hard for me to order something else the next time I am here.  Two last notes: First, when heading to the restroom area, you are able to see into the entire kitchen and I really mean the entire kitchen, floor to ceiling, delivery area to grills. It was impeccably clean which is not too common anymore. Second, all of the staff was amazing. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant was taking care of us that night while we sat at the bar, and in fact, they probably all did. We enjoyed the entire night there and would to go back soon!",

They said it was due to surrounding events that caused them to be unusually busy. It took way too long for us to get our drinks and that was right before the major rush hit.  The atmosphere was casual and a bit on the noisy side. Very brightly lit! It is in the middle of a main shopping area. Kind of fun for people watching. I didn't care for my Moscow Mule cocktail. I sent it back. Not sure how they make theirs and couldn't keep the waiter long enough to find out, but they replaced it with another drink. We understood how busy it was, but the waiter didn't even try to explain and or apologize. Nor check back with us on how our food was. We had to ask for the manager. They did comp one of our beers for the wait. We had Alfredo, Pizza and Eggplant. All of which were delicious!   We recommend Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria! Just check to see how busy they are before you sit down! Vegas can be so unpredictable!",

We tipped them well :) I hate when places judge you based on your age & they definitely didn't do that.  Anyways we had the following, and everything was good & consistent:  Prosciutto San Daniele, Burrata Mozzarella, Cracked Black Pepper, Aged Balsamic (4 stars)= This was really good with the aged balsamic, needed something else though, maybe tomatoes or a pesto to balance out the dish, or just more balsamic :)  Margherita, Mozzarella, San Marzano Tomato, Basil (4 stars)= Really good flavor with the San Marzano tomatoes, those are my favorite!  Spicy Pepperoni, Calabrian Chili, Fresh Ricotta (4 stars)= Different and yummy, spicy pepperoni with the ricotta worked really well together!  Roasted Eggplant, Garlic Spinach, Fresh Mozzarella (4 stars)= Normally don't like eggplant, but this wasn't bad, the flavor was good!  I would come back if I was in the area for some yummy Pizza!",

We ordered the cheese ravioli, Margarita pizza and lemon cheesecake with blueberries. It was OKAY, would I go back? Probably not unless we are lazy to drive off the strip since it's walking distance from her place.  In my yelp opinion I rather drive off strip and get the same or better quality food for a better price tag $ My gf's friend was our waitress so we had good customer service.  I probably won't be back especially since I don't drink so even happy hour won't bring me back. Next.",

    "text": "Before heading out to the airport, we decided to check out Cucina by Wolfgang Puck for lunch. An open restaurant with nice clean modern decor in the Crystal shops near Aria. Only a few patrons for lunch today, the hostess sat us quickly and the waitress came quickly and offered is water immediately after we sat down. We decided on the wild mushrooms and hen egg pizza ($17) and the Papardelle pasta ($22) after looking at Yelp reviews and recommendations by the waitress. The food took a while to come out, I'd guess 15 minutes, which is a bit long especially since there weren't many other customers in the restaurants.  Anyways, when the food came out, I was surprised by the portion. The pizza was a 10-inch pizza but most places that offer pizza on the menu is this puny sized a bit bigger than your hand pizza but this one was huge! Maybe 6 good sized slices. The pappardelle portion was pretty big too. My pizza was  in one word, amazing. The pizza was like paper thin and the crust was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms, braised leeks, and fontina and taleggio cheese were rich and delicious. The hens egg (albeit a bit dry looking) was cooked okay so I could slice the egg and the yolk spilled out into the pizza. Altogether the bite was very tasty, with the richness and earthiness of the mushrooms and egg with the right balance of the salty cheese. Next the pappardelle was very impressive. Hand-made and cooked to order (as per the waitress), the pasta was very silky and tasted fresh. The marinara was alright to me but altogether, a fine pasta. After the disaster of last night's crap dinner at another name chef's restaurant (a dude famous for Creole), I was impressed and satisfied at this chef's restaurant. I'd definitely try again! 4/5 stars only because despite having quality and tasty food with good service, it was only pizza and pasta. Nothing inventive and outrageously delicious.",

Started with the mussel special with spicy tomato sauce with a bit of white wine for appetizer (wish I got a picture!), prosciutto pizza (pepporoni, salami, red onions, and oregeno), and Pappardelle (wild boar raguat ++ pecorino). Then ending with Vanilla Zeppole which is basically fresh fried donuts with white chocolate and raspberry cream! All so good! Definitely recommended!!! I honestly can't go to another Italian place based on flavor, fresh dough and the best pasta I've ever had. #cucinaitaliana #wolfgangpuck #freshpasta #foodporn #foodie #lasvegas #inlovewithfood #anniversary #yum",

The pizza could've used more fresh pieces of basil, instead of just one measly herb per slice.",

My boyfriend and his brother both ordered the Lamb Sirloin.  They asked the waitress for mint jelly and were upset that they didn't have any.  They even went so far as to ask the chef to make them a mint sauce....giving the waitress directions for doing so.  I was so embarrassed!  But she was a trooper and took it all in stride,  And when it all came down to it, they both enjoyed their meals.  The other girl in our party ordered the Chicken Piccata and seemed to enjoy it.    I would go back for sure, just without the company of my boyfriend's brother...he's a bit hard to take!

    "text": "I'm new to Yelp and usually don't write reviews, but after having dinner at Brasserie Puck I felt compelled to change my ways.  We started out at the bar for a glass of wine and a little conversation. We weren't famliar with the wine list, and the bartender was more than helpful. After making our choices, we enjoyed just sitting at the bar and taking in the scene. The bartenders were very good at being right in front of us whenever we needed something, and out of earshot when we didn't. Uncanny!  My husband and I had dinner on a weeknight and it wasn't very busy, so we had our choice of tables. I'm sure this will change once word gets out! Being in the middle of CityCenter makes for a strange lighting situation inside the restaurant. We sat in a booth near the back in an attempt to avoid the flourescent lights. I'm sure it is fine during lunch, but it doesn't set the stage for a romantic experience. Fortunately, the food is SO good that once you bite into something, the lighting just doesn't matter anymore!  We shared an appetizer of calamari with garlic aioli, and I can easily say it's the best we've found so far in las vegas (we're locals). Calamari was perfectly crisp with a wonderful tasting batter that didn't over or underwhelm the calamari. The aioli was absolutely amazing - garlicky, with a little bit of spicy kick.   My husband had the ravioli with field mushrooms and parmesan. I can't comment much on that - but his plate was shiny clean when he was done. :)  I had the pizza with french goat cheese, and I'm still thinking about it! We lived in Europe for 3 years and fell in love with their style of woodfired pizzas. Its just something that isn't duplicated often here in the states. When I took the first bite of the goat cheese pizza, I was amazed at how so many memories of our time there came rushing back. It's funny how a simple taste and/or smell can have such a profound effect! The crust was thin and crisp, the sauce had an intriguing blend of spices, and the goat cheese was tart and creamy.   Our waiter (I'm sorry but I forgot his name), was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu (we asked A LOT of questions), and was spot-on with his wine pairings for our meal.   We plan on visiting again very soon - especially with the 25% discount for locals through April (this is food AND wine, by the way!).",

Tasty stuff.  My son ordered the \"meatlovers' pizza and said it was good--nice crust.  My daughter had a half order of the carbonara which was kindly prepped without the zucchini.  She's not a huge eater but she polished it off.  I had the chicken piccata which was a huge serving over nicely cooked broccolini and my husband had the pork milanese (aka schnitzel) which was also huge, serviced with a really lovely arugula and fennel salad.  We shared the chocolate cremosa for dessert which was (frankly) just OK.  The teeny scoop of espresso gelato served with it was the star of the show.  It was the absolute essence of coffee, seriously.  This could have been a four-star meal; however, the service was jinky.  It took a while for the waiter to come by and see us after the hostess dropped us off.  He was nice but he didn't seem to know much about the menu.  I asked if the fritto misto was floured / battered and he was confused by my question and answered that it just \"came out of a bag.\"  Um, that's not what I asked and certainly not what I want to hear when dining at one of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants.  The restaurant is located in the Crystals shopping mall which felt cold and deserted at 730PM on a Sunday evening.",

It brings white wine and makes it sweet. Omg it tastes REALLY good and it still has the alcohol taste in there. I think it was during happy hour, so I got a dollar or two knocked off its price. I don't think I would have enjoyed the red wine sangria as much though.  Friendly service and friendly bar service as well :D",

Honestly, the food was pretty good so I'm disappointed that there weren't a lot of people, but I guess in comparison to all the glitz and glamour of all the Las Vegas restaurants, this restaurant gets lost. (especially since its in The Shops at Crystals. The Shops at Crystals is like desert land compared to the Strip.)  Food: We started off with the minestrone soup and shared it between all 5 of us. It was decent soup. Couldn't complain. We also got the garlic bread since there was no complimentary bread unfortunately.   Mushroom Pizza: The mushroom pizza was flavorful. The crust was thin but not too thin. It had a fried egg on top, which I love.   Linguine: Solid linguine, fresh seafood.    Pork Chop: I'm not a big fan of pork chops as I find it too dry/dense sometimes but it was a decent dish. The polenta on the bottom was very well done.   Sea Bass: I loved the sea bass. It was very flaky and flavorful. The lemon-caper butter sauce was on point. The side vegetable was broccolini and that's my favorite, so I am a little bias to this dish already.   This is a nice little spot away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. Definitely recommend it for a casual dinner, especially if you're staying at the Aria next door.",

And even after the bartender approached us with the menus, we still had to wait a while before he returned, leaving the food menus on the counter even thou we said we just want some drinks. The  Sangria was very mediocre. No one asked how we like our drinks. And I watched the table next to us and noticed how the waiter was serving these 4 women desert while their dirty empty dishes were still on the table. I watched many mister Puck's shows and enjoyed it quite a bit. So I must say that this review is written for the sole purpose of the restaurant's improvement. Wishing the best!",

    "text": "The absolute worse meal I had in a restaurant in years.  EPIC BAD  Had pizza here once before and the place was quite good. It was clean and had friendly service.    After my last stop, I will never eat here again.  In a party of three, we order apps and simple dishes.  Again, the waiter was very friendly, that was the high point.  The apps were ok, nothing special.  The main meal was HORRENDOUS.  The absolute worse meal I can ever remember having out.  The dish was spaghetti and meatballs.  It is the most basic dish one can serve.  Any beginner can serve a half decent dish of it.  It started off with the staff handing one member in our party their meal 15 minutes before they served our meal (one person ordered the same thing). The meal was cold, the spaghetti overcooked and the sauce was can quality.  It was basically eating Franco American spaghetti from a can but 10 times worse.  The meal was sent back and another attempt at it was made.  The same exact dish came out.  It seemed like the spaghetti was sitting in water for a 1/2 hour, it could literally break apart in pieces tapping it with a fork.  My meal had the same exact problem.  I asked the hostess if I could speak to her manager and she told me she's in the back and I'll call her.  She never answered and she told me she probably left for the night.  I sportingly paid my whole bill even though they should have paid me to eat there.  I called again the next day and asked to speak to the manager to tell them how atrocious their place is and how I never want to see any customer served that rot, I was put on hold and hung up on.  The cowardly manager didn't even have the class to answer their phone.  STAY AWAY",

I came here due to all the good reviews on Yelp, and I'm so glad I did.  We came here for dinner, and the service was really good.  We got seated right away in a booth, which overlooked part of the shopping area.  My daughter was really distracted by the water lights below.  We ordered Bruschetta as an appetizer and it was amazing!  The bread was toasted with a garlic spread on top, and there were cherry tomatoes and fresh mozzerella.  We devoured this appetizer so quick that I wish there was more.  My daughter had the spaghetti and meatballs from the kids menu, and she really enjoyed it.  She kept eating the noodles.  I tried the spaghetti and it was delicious.  It was cooked a bit al dente, too.  For my main dish, I ordered the sea bass, which was cooked perfectly.  The skin was really crispy, and I loved dipping it in the sauce.  The sea bass was placed on top a bed of vegetables, which was all delicious.  My husband ordered the Chicken Piccati and he really loved it.  The chicken was really moist, too.  For dessert, I ordered the flourless chocolate dessert which was really tasty.  It tasted really good with the hazelnut ice cream.  Overall, I highly recommend Cucina!  This was one of the best meals we had in Vegas.  It is very kid friendly, since there is a kids menu.  The service was really awesome here!",

I also tried the chicken parm and that was delish! Such a neat place located inside city center. If you uber here, ask to be dropped off at the city center entrance by the aria - you'll walk right into it.

    "text": "Since Wolfie is one of my favorite chefs, I have been jonesing to come here for quite a while.   Initially, I wanted to check out their all day happy hour menu served at the bar area only, but our group was starving and wanted a meal.  We decided to order the chef's tasting menu for the table.  They did not tell us what would be on the menu and that it would be a surprise.    Where do we start on this buffet of disappointment?  It was utterly the most worst meal that I have had in Vegas. I have never left so much food on my plate in a restaurant in my ENTIRE life.  Even the guys could barely finish their plates.    We started off with complimentary bread, a mixed greens caesar salad and 2 mini bite-size crab cakes, calamari, then pesto gnocchi, flank steak, concluded by a shareable dessert plate.  Pesto gnocchi was just not good.  Not sure where it fell flat but it did.  It was a lifeless glob of mediocrity.  The pesto was muted by the heavy cream and the gnocchi's texture was just completely off.  We literally sampled maybe 2 to 3 pieces of the gnocchi.  Flank steak - this could arguably be the worst dish.  The meat came very rare, which we did not mind.  The meat quality was very poor which translated into a very poor decision made by the chef.  Cooking the meat rare made it so rubbery and chewy and difficult to swallow.  You would think that if the meat quality isn't great or if you are trying to get rid of inventory in the kitchen by pawning it off in the chef's tasting menu - then at least make it edible and cook the meat through.  Faulty execution.  It is highly concerning when the best part of the meal was the salad and the bread bowl.    The dessert was an epic fail as well.  We barely touched the rubbery STALE cakes which were almost tasteless.  It was almost an anomaly because it appeared to be look like it would have some flavor or richness but it tasted like bad buffet desserts that have been sitting out for a long time.   Service was okay but disjointed - the one thing they were excellent on was refreshing the water.   I'm so pissed that I forgot to apply the 20% off to our $300 \"dinner\".  It was a waste of food and money and time.  Honestly, I wish my meal was just comped.  Ugh - beyond annoyed.  It was so late and we were the last table of the night so we didn't bother to complain.  Plus, how awkward is it to report to the server, uhh your chef sucks and this is his menu?  If you do go here, my recommendation is to order from the regular menu or happy hour menu - that is probably the better way to go.  Location: Crystals at Aria on the 2nd floor",

The restaurant is open air located in the Shoppes at Crystals. The server was very helpful and after a brief glance at the menu we settled on the meatballs and shrimp scampi starters. We had another fried starter that I wasn't in love with but hey you can't win them all.  I was completely satisfied with dining experience the service was fast and food was delicious. I would definitely dine here again.",

I ordered a Prix-Fixe lunch that came with a Caesar salad, a spaghetti entree and a dessert ($29) and a blue moon ($9).  My salad was delicious, one of the best Caesar salad I've had. My entree however, although delicious, very tiny portion, seemed like a kid's size meal. My Tiramisu was pretty good.  My wife's pizza was delicious and pretty good portion as well.  Overall, a good visit other than the very tiny entree portion, almost laughable honestly. The $14 for the glass of wine was a bit expensive we thought. Wanted to give 4 stars, but that kid size portion killed that idea.",

The service was even better if you can believe it. Fernando was on point. He made great recommendations, and before we even orded asked about our food allergies and preferences.  At one point my aunt dropped her fork and someone swooped in and took it away then someone behind him a second later to replace it with a clean one- all in a blink of an eye. This trip was weeks ago and we are still raving about our phenomenal experience. Drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts, they were all AMAZING! Oh! I almost forgot their coffee! I had no idea coffee could taste good without a gallon of flavored creamer- I drank it black and wanted a second!",

Overpowering oily.  The chicken cacciatore was grilled to perfection but the sauce was on the top. Traditionally, the chicken is Cooked IN the sauce. But OK. It could be a new interpretation. The polenta was scrumptious. Highly recommend.  Pesto sauce was also good. You could taste those pine nuts!  I would give 4 stars for food and 2 for service, hence 3 stars.",

I quite enjoyed it.  This has a nicer ambiance than a lot of the casino restaurants.    We shared the shrimp scampi, which was very tasty.  I wish I could remember exactly what pasta dishes we got, but I can tell you, I remember they were both delicious.  Our server was very nice.  I enjoyed their little half booths.

They offered a wonderful menu and provided a lovely meal. Service was very attentive as my water glass did not go empty.  Our mother's brought us up right and taught us to share.  We were able to enjoy many of the dishes with leftovers.  We started with the Summer Panzanella Salad.  This salad is so light and refreshing.  It embodied fresh tomatoes, cucumber, greens and croutons.  It's definitely a great starter salad that won't ruin the rest of the meal.     Next up is the Sweet Corn Ravioli, Chicken Piccata & Meat Pizza.  I was won over by this twist on ravioli.  I loved the sweet flavor with the creamy burrata.  The Chicken Piccata matched the excellence of the ravioli.  The chicken gave way to the light sauce and fresh asparagus.  The Italian Meat Pizza was loaded with pepperoni, coppa, red onion & olives.  It was good but I would stick to the pasta and entree options.   Our dessert choices included Tiramisu and Chocolate Budino.  I loved the budino. The chocolate cake pieces on chocolate pudding with cherry pieces & whipped cream created a masterpiece dessert.  And really how can you go wrong with Tiramisu? It's wonderfully made here to cap off a fulfilling meal.   So if you're hungry in the Crystal Shops, Cucina is a great option.",

They even had a happy hour going on at that time if you didn't want to have a full dinner course just yet.   I wanted to eat early especially since I will be going out Saturday night so I wanted to make sure everything digested properly before the heavy drinking commenced lol. I ended up ordering the piccolo antipasti board and the pappardelle pasta, both were recommended by the bartender.  Fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed both items. The anti pasta board had various seasonal assortment of cheeses and meats, along with grilled bread, pickled veggies, and two jams: a grain mustard peach jam and a Calabrian pepper jam. Everything paired so well together from the anti pasta board. The wild boar pappardella is a must. The sauce isn't heavy, but the thick ribbons of fresh pasta will definitely fill you up.   Overall, I will definitely be back since this restaurant is so close to where I stay in Vegas and the food is fantastically prepared.",

I've cooked chicken and froze and reheated chicken before and it never comes out this dry. How do you make a leg of all things dry? My waiter did check on us and I informed him about the chicken being dry but that was that. I do have to say the mushrooms and corn under the chicken were outstanding, I did enjoy them. The potatoes tasted like box potatoes but might have been fresh?  My husband had the veal osso bucco and he said the veal was dry and disappointing but the gnocchi were good and light.  I don't know if they were having a bad day or if they are like this all the time. My husband was here before and thought the wild boar ragout was really good here before but the waiter talked him into trying the osso bucco that was dry.  Wolfgang needs to spend less time on the shopping channel and more time in his restaurants.",

Our reservation was for 7, arrived just in time and were sat almost immediately. We all ordered pizzas, and they were the perfect size for us (with no leftovers which is a blessing as hotel rooms are not equipped with microwaves.) The prices are pretty reasonable for a restaurant with a well known namesake, and the people watching is OK in the middle of the mall dedicated to high end fashion.  End note: You can tell people you ate at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and let them assume you spent $$$$, pizza is always a good time.",

Of the nine kids who were with us (ages 7 to 15), everyone who tried the octopus loved it. For the entree I had the roasted duck ravioli, a $28 chef's special that wasn't quite as amazing as it sounds. The other star of the night was their cauliflower with capers and chili. Finally, portion sizes are neither sparse nor overflowing; salad, cauliflower and ravioli all together didn't have me loosening me belt.",

They also play pretty good music here! Service is ok, the food tends to come out a bit slow, but it's not too bad. The best thing about this place is the food! It's pretty amazing. I honestly haven't had anything that I disliked here. My favorite dishes would be the calamari appetizer, lasagna, and the pasta with clams and garlic sauce. I've also tried the spaghetti and meatballs as well as the chicken piccata, both were pretty good. I tried the four cheese ravioli, it was good but it wasn't as good as I had expected it to be, so I probably wouldn't order that again.   This place would get a full 5 stars if they brought back the lasagna. Seriously, why would you guys take that away?!? That was the best lasagna I have ever eaten and it was the best thing on the menu! The ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was just perfect. I really miss it. Lasagna is such a staple item that I'm confused as to why it was taken away. So bring it back and I may bump up my rating.",

Order the small bites and a pitcher of sangria, and escape the tremendously high prices around you with above average, branded food at above average prices.  WPP&C has a happy-hour-esque bar menu with small bites--like stuffed peppers, mushroom pasta balls, and small-portion paninis.  Prices are reasonable, and the food is tasty, if not particularly different from food you could get at a Wolfgang Puck in an airport.  3.5 stars, rounded up because everything else in Crystals includes prices that makes one's head explode.",

Went to Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party and decided to go here for our bachelorette dinner!   AMBIANCE- 4 stars! FOOD- 5 stars! SERVICE- 5 stars!  Ambiance was nice and simple, very open and modern. Hard to give it a 5 star because my other favorite restaurant Mon Ami Gabi over at Paris is hard to top. But this was a very schnazzy and fun place to have dinner.   The food can't even compete! Because it was pool day the next day, my friend and i decided to split the clam linguine. Which seriously was sooo good. Everyone else's was drool on myself good as well! The grilled chicken, chicken carbonara, and the rib eye steak that I got to taste from each of my friends plate made me wish there was an entree sampler... which I could have ALL TO MYSELF! Loved  everything!  Service was great! Waiters and waitresses were accomodating and very friendly! For the bachelorette party, we had a scavenger hunt going where we had to find certain guys to pose or do certain things and all of them were ethusiastic and completely on board. One guy was all about it and even went the extra mile. (Thought to myself: okay dude, thanks but realllly thanks now ok? lol)  Overall, loved the food and will definitely be back to share the experience with more people!",

It's located in an open area, so a good location to people watch while eating lunch.  The food we had was not very impressive. I didn't come in with high expectations, since it was just for a quick lunch, but I wanted a tastier meal because it was a Wolfgang puck restaurant. We ordered the specials they had for the day, Rock shrimp pizza and steamed mussels. The pizza was very bland and the cheese was overwhelming in taste. Our mussels were too salty and a lot of my shells were empty.   The staff was very friendly, but the service took awhile. The restaurant was not busy at all, but it took over 45 minutes to get two entrees out. I didn't have the best experience here, so I will not be coming back.",

Although it was fairly empty, the ambiance, service, and menu compelled us to try this place. I had the Tuna burger. I have to say that it was the best Tuna burger that I've ever had. The flavor and rare cooking with perfect. It was served with \"promme frite\" fries cooked crispy and perfectly seasoned. I can only imagine with the beef burger tastes like. This place is a must if you're in the City Center located just outside Aria (skip Todd English's pub)!",

    "text": "Compared to other restaurants in Vegas, this has been one of my favorites. I went for lunch, the menu did not have too many options, so if you are a picky eater you may want to look at the menu online first. Everything was great. I had the mozzarella panini with tomato soup. It also came with a simple side salad. The dressing was very light and went well with the panini. The tomato soup was on the smaller side, meant for dipping. It tasted great! The lunch was only $14 not including drinks and tip. For such a great well rounded lunch for that price, you can't really ask for much more.   It's located in Crystals and you can get a great view of the shopping mall, the beautiful artwork, and a great place for people watching. I'm a tourist myself, but its interesting to see how different the people are that come to Vegas for a good time! Check this place out, if all else fails, at least you can say you've tried Wolfgang Pucks food.",

I really liked it and so did my husband. The bartendar was very knowledgabel and friendly. We had a great time sitting at the bar and having some bar snacks oh and a glas of wine. We would return.",

Food was great for the price. I had the Gnoochi and I am very picky about my Gnoochi. This was top notch in texture and flavor. The procuitto was great, a little difficult to eat but the flavor profile with the mozzerella was excellent. KP had the ravioli which was good, not spectacular but good nontheless. Recommended for a nice early dinner if you don't have reservations or don't want to spend 200 plus. Our check came out to just over 90 bucks including wine and desert. Tipped heavilly as the staff was great.",

    "text": "A bunch of my friends were all gambling it up at Aria and decided to walk over to the City Center and spotted this place. Looked like a nice spot to grab lunch/dinner. We came for lunch. We had a large party of about 11, so it took them a few minutes to set something up for us. Our waitress seemed nice at first, but she kept mixing up orders. 5 people ordered a salad, but only 4 came out and she said she thought that person wanted his salad as an entree. This happened multiple times for various things up and down the table. I am not sure if anyone came across rude to her, but I detected a hint of sarcasm in her tone later on.  We ordered some oysters - they were pretty fresh and standard also the calamari was very tasty. I ordered the Frisee salad with poached egg, lardon and bacon. This salad has to be one of the best salads I have ever had. This salad alone pretty much gives me a favorable view of this restaurant.  This next dish, I had some mixed reviews on. It was mussels with fries and the typical slice of bread. But the bread had this disgusting sauce smothered all over it. I can eat anything, but I had to tell the waitress that this sauce was a little overwhelming. Next time I ever order this, I would ask for no sauce on the bread.  I would definitely recommend this place but maybe for smaller groups. Also the price was a little steep for a lunch but hey it's Vegas.",

The ice cream assortment was great - fresh mango, pear, and other yummy  flavors - but the vanilla is absolutely to die for.  The servers and bartenders are knowledgeable and really friendly.  Nice ambiance, even the bathroom is beautiful.   I'll be going back.  update 1/5/11 - Went back for a business meal.  Was fabulous.  I had the swordfish, my colleague had gnocchi.

Searched and searched around for a good restaurant and finally decided to just go to this place since it is a branch of the Wolfgang Puck chain of restaurants. This place is located in the Crystals shopping area and it was fairly quiet because it was proabably a Wednesday night. Got seated and the menu isn't big, but had a good variety. Waitress was very helpful and so were the people refilling our water. My friend wanted the water with no ice so they always accomodated every time she needed a refill. I ordered Ravioli with wild mushroom, husband ordered Salmon with rosemary, friends ordered some pasta dish. The dishes were not big, but it was good although mine was a little bit on the salty side. Overall, good service, good location and good food except for the salty part.",

The last pizza place I went to owned by a celebrity chef sucked balls (SERIOUS PIE SEATTLE), so I was a little apprehensive when sitting down and looking over the menu.  HOWEVER  We ended up ordering the Prosciutto, Smoked Chorizo, and Italian Meat pizzas. Each were unique - herby - meaty - awesome. By far, the Prosciutto was the best, but I would order any of these pizzas again. As for pricing, it was fair and we all ended up spending around $12ish.   Ambiance was also really nice. Actually, upon reconsideration, all new Vegas restaurants have to look good or else it wouldn't be Vegas.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you're in the Crystals mall and looking for good food.",

    "text": "First about the service...  My wolfpack went to Brasserie PUCK for dinner the Saturday we were in Vegas. We unfortunately were running late for our reservation & arrived 45 minutes after we were supposed to at 9:45 to a nearly empty restaurant. We assumed we wouldn't have any trouble with our table, so when we were told by the hostess that she'd have to check with a manager to see if we could be sat, we were rather shocked. After we were told that we could finally sit, a couple behind us were told that they were closed. Really? 10 p.m. on a Saturday night in Vegas where everything is open 24/7?  Hm, but maybe there's a lesson in all of this and my dear, dear wolfpack that I love so so very much won't run so late anymore?  But I digress.    I guess we shouldn't be surprised since the hotel was pretty empty too.  I have never seen a hotel/casino so empty on the Vegas strip on a Saturday night.  Once we got passed that frustration, we were greeted by some awesome servers. Like, nearly all of the ones working that night.  Super fun & friendly, but it also seemed like they had nothing better to do?   Now about the food... Us wolves weren't so hungry due to the large feast we had for lunch, so we all only ordered entrees.  We all ordered: 1) Italian meat pizza (according to my friends, not very good) 2) Rigatoni carbonara (I think it was rigatoni... delish, according to friends) 3) Ahi with asparagus & potatoes (I ordered this - very good ahi... though I like mine better :P  The asparagus and potatoes were cooked and seasoned nicely.) 4) Salmon, again with asparagus & potatoes (according to my friend, delicious)  Except for the lone wolf that ordered the pizza, I think we would all agree that we would order our food again.  The mixed drinks 2 of the members of my wolfpack ordered were awesome.  I ordered a pinot grigio with my other wolf - it complemented our meals very nicely. Oh - and the bread was good, too.  We would all definitely eat here again, if it's still there when we go next.  Hopefully City Center starts to pick up in business, because it was a gorgeous hotel/casino & it has some fantastic restaurants!",

    "text": "My friends and I were walking around Aria and found another Wolfgang Puck establishment in the middle of the City Center mall.   I've always been a fan of Wolfgang Pucks culinary style and dropped in for a quick lunch.   The hostess was extremely welcoming as she was able to handle a group of 12 with ease.   She seated us right outside the kitchen area w. the frosted glass and decided to order away.   We had the following dishes:  Crispy Calamari with Spicy Garlic Aioli:  4/5  the spicy garlic Aioli was delicious but portions were tiny.   One order only feeds two people at best.  Pizza Margherita: 1/5  the waitress warned us that these are appetizer portion...boy was she right, paper thin and definitely not worth getting.  Oysters:  4/5  they were fresh but where were they from?  gotta give me the locale, east, west? type? something.....  Main dish was Mussels w. Chirizo - 5/5  amazingly tasty.  Mussels were tender and that validates how fresh they were.  The chirizo gave it that little kick to enhance the flavor.  Ambiance: 5/5  great lunch spot  Service: 2.5/5  some of the dishes came out at odd times, they need to be in sync so they don't piss off the other half of the table.",

My husband had the mushroom pizza and that was also very good. They also have happy hour all day every day so you can get sangrias and other drinks for pretty cheap. We were there on a special occasion so they also hooked us up on a free dessert - some sort of tart and it was yummy! I would definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "I was really surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this restaurant. We had just arrived in Las Vegas and we were starving with no dinner reservations. We hopped the train from Bellagio to Crystals at City Center and within minutes we were seated at a booth overlooking the cavernous Crystals bottom floor. What a treat! While we dined, we were treated to a quasi-flash mob of dancers as well as various duos of dancers performing modern and classical dances. Without a doubt, these are the most coveted seats in the restaurant!  There was no pretense at all at this \"celebrity\" outpost of the famed Wolfgang Puck. It was casual and comfortable, and the service was attentive but not overly so. We started with the calamari fritti which was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. My husband had the Veal Scallopini. It arrived as an abundant plateful of succulent and tender veal 6covered in mushrooms and artichokes. My hubby, who has a huge appetite, was \"complaining\" he was full about half-way through his plate.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan which came with a side of Capellini Pasta. It, too, was a generous portion of delicious eggplant which was not overly breaded or greasy.  (I consider myself an eggplant parm connoisseur and order it whenever I see it on the menu.)  This one did not disappoint! Like my better half, I could barely get through half and was bummed that I had no place to heat it or store it back at the hotel to devour later.  What impressed me most, after the food and unexpected entertainment, was the modest bill. With all we ordered as well as a glass of wine and a martini, we didn't even hit $100, a feat I wish we could duplicate at other LV restaurants named for a famous chef!",

We parked in the Aria hotel lot and took the Tram into the Crystals drop in the City Center.  At the top of the Tram station you can look down into the Aria swimming/relaxation village - that seems to be the most hip place for the under 30 crowd.  Lots of great scenery!  As for the WP pie, it was nice.  I would recommend one of the pastas over the pizza, which was great but not my first choice.  Pizza just doesn't need to be so gourmet.  Except I Yelped Pizza and so that's why we ended up there.  Coulda just had a slice instead of the whole $18 pie which I threw most of away.",

Take special note to the wooden stair cases throughout Crystals.  Absolutely stunning carpentry, sky lights and walls/lines and floors.  Anyhow, after we were seated, with not a full house, it took an unusually long amount of time for our assigned wait person to arrive and intro himself.  Anyhow, we split the kale salad, which as fantastic.  We got a Margarita pizza and a rigatoncini.  Both were quite good, although we felt the pizza wasn't anything to write home about where the other was really good.  It took a long time for a glass of wine and pineapple mojito to arrive.  We had to ask for table bread too.  We asked what the WP label was - meaning what label is it that WP puts his sticker over.  No one in the restaurant could answer the question. That seemed a bit weird.",

So we decided to stroll through Bellagio and then in Vdara (to see a condo unit), and finally into Aria (and Crystals Mall at Aria) to shop...our tummies were grumbly and we were sore over dropping $200 on NOTHING, and so we went back to Cucina (we had been there last year), and were greeted immediately by a smiling hostess, seated right away, and got Tony as our waiter. We ordered two handcrafted pizzas, and chowed down...DAMN THEY WERE GOOD.  - One was Italian sausage, greens, and hot peppers. - The other was margherita, tomato, and basil.  Both were LIGHTS OUT GOOD.   - Service was fast. - Food was amazing. - It was a simple follow-up plan after an terrible $200 dinner.   Could not go wrong here and we ate for $40 and should have gone here in the first place. Oh well, live and learn in Vegas!  ENJOY!",

Walking into the City Center mall, I could tell the ambiance would not be the best but the hostess and servers who greeted us helped bring back a nice restaurant feel.  Service was always friendly and helpful but definitely a little slow. I did up my rating from 2 to 3 stars because of how helpful everyone here was to our group from recommending drinks to walking us through dishes on the menu.  With good service but a mediocre environment, the food could have really made this place stand out. Sadly, it was around the same as a slightly higher end chain American-Italian restaurant (think Magiano's, Buca, Brio, etc). The pastas were overcooked and the pizza were soggy. Sauces were watery and under seasoned. Fortunately meats were well cooked and portions were decently sized (for Vegas).  Considering all the great food in this city, it would be hard for me to ever return to Cucina or recommend it to anyone.",

Location is inside the crystal shops adjacent to the aria hotel.  Kind of an interesting location being in a shopping mall with a wide open concept.  A few reasons why I didn't like this place.  1. Waiter was VERY nice (his name was Tony).  But not sure if it's because it wasn't packed or possibly felt like he was the only waiter working for Saturday night dinner, but service was really slow.  Long wait for food and check.    2. Food wasn't amazing.  Saw a bunch of pics on Yelp that may have been outdated but a lot of those foods were not on the menu anymore.  We have the spaghetti (decent), pepperoni pizza (decent), margherita pizza (not good), prosciutto pizza (VERY good), and ravioli (plain).    Glad I got to try the place, but most likely won't be back.",

    "text": "Neither of us were surprised that we walked away from our dinner here fully impressed by the food and the service. It's a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, after all, so right or wrong, you expect a bit more from one of his establishments. Or maybe that's just us.   At any rate, we walked over to this restaurant pretty soon after we pulled in to Vegas. It was a long drive from home, and though we were both tired, our need for sustenance trumped our need for sleep. We did a quick search of restaurants in the area (the map we had open looked like it had a bad case of measles, so many red dots appeared), and narrowed our choices down to two places.   On our way to Wolfgang's place, we passed the other restaurant we had been contemplating, but neither of us got the warm and fuzzies from it, so we kept on.   We didn't realize that the restaurant was located in what I can only compare to as the high-end shopping malls back home. Lots of glitter. Lots of bling. Lots of shops I can't afford. It was strange, but hey, it's Vegas!   Anyway, we were seated right away, and our waiter - friendly, knowledgeable, opinionated without being pushy - gave us time to settle in, browse the drink and food menus, and decide on our entree choices.   Truly, I wanted the grilled sea bass, but couldn't justify spending $32 on that dish alone. Normally I don't balk at food prices, especially when I'm on any kind of a vacation, but I couldn't get past it. So, I went with the Pappardelle, instead. Brilliant choice, as it turned out.   The pasta was fantastic! I had to force myself to slow down and eat like a lady, because otherwise I could have just tilted my head back and dumped the entire contents of the plate down my gullet in one shot.   The meat sauce was incredible. I've had some pretty tasty meat sauces in my life, but this one was by far my favorite. Tender chunks of meat married perfectly with the slight acidity of the tomatoes, which perfectly paired with the pasta and the cheese. Oh, yeah. It makes my mouth water just remembering it!   My husband ordered the linguine pasta, and he enjoyed that immensely. They loaded him up on shellfish, and he kept commenting on the flavor of the sauce and how tender the noodles were. At least, I think that's what he was saying. It was hard to listen to him over all the yummy noises I was making in my head, while consuming my own dinner.   And while the plates didn't look overloaded when they were set down in front of us, they certainly filled us up right.   Had we been in Vegas longer than the weekend, we absolutely would have gone back. Service and food quality will always bring us back. Serving bread with the meal would have been a slam-dunk, though.",

Went to dinner with my family and friends the restaurant was empty there were like 2 people by the bar and we still had to wait 30 mins for the server to come and take our orders then another 40-60mins for them to bring our food.  The food was whatever.  At the end we ordered coffee and desserts so there goes another 20mins waiting for that.  I asked the waitress how much longer she said \"it's coming right up\" ok so we sit and wait.  After waiting for another 30 mins we asked for the check and still no dessert so we got up to leave and I told the waitress on the way out we never got our dessert she didn't even apologize or anything just smiled.  Will not be going back.  Was expecting more from this place.",

On one occasion, I had to actually stop the guy because my glass was more than halfway full. There was no need to continue to pour wine in there. Finally, my pasta had great flavor; however, it was a bit too salty. I do have to say that everything had a beautiful presentation. Would I give this place a second chance? Possibly.",

Very high-end surroundings, however this is a nice semi-affordable respite from the crazy shopping.  All the food was prepared very well save the polenta. I ordered the loaded polenta as a side and although it tasted good, it did make me question the dish. At least for me, polenta is at a minimum semi firm if not fully so. This dish was a corn meal mush with sausage and bits of corn served in a cast iron. It's texture was just to soupy to merit calling it polenta.   The Caesar was excellent, with very small fishes as it should be. Great tasting, fresh and a damn near perfect mix of ingredients. Lobster Rav was better than average but not spectacular. Egg parm was very good and we shared several bites across the table :).   Overall, this is a good spot to eat/munch in the area for the price.",

Didn't really know what to expect as I've never dined at other Wolfgang Puck restaurants but didn't think I would be blown away. We ordered a variety of things but I'll only review on the food I actually tasted.  I ordered the pappadelle. The pasta itself was nice. Cooked a little longer than I would have preferred but still pretty good egg based pasta. The sauce was the hit of the show. A beautifully made tomato based sauced seasoned well with the wild boar. It was a little salty to my liking as half way through the dish I was about to tap out. With that being said though, I do prefer milder salt tastes. Meat was cooked well not a whole lot to complain about my dish.  I also got to taste the spaghetti pomodoro. Tomato sauce was alright. Meatballs were pretty well seasoned. Not bad but really nothing special. Also tried some of the seafood linguine. The linguine itself was overcooked in my opinion. The white wine sauce was bland and a little boring. There was a good portion of seafood which was cooked pretty well but overall a disappointment for me and my friend who ordered it.   One last thing about cucina, not sure if it was just the large table we had but my goodness, I was so uncomfortable the whole evening. The tables were too low and the chairs were too high so the entire night I'm just hunched over the table trying to eat and at the end of the night my back was hurting. This may just be me being annoyingly picky and my bad posture but even for a not so tall person, it was just really not comfortable place to be.",

Broccolini under the fish is really good    Gnocchi with grilled chicken: 5 star, I'm allergic to shrimp So I replaced the shrimp with chicken. The gnocchi is not as chewy as the other places but omg, I would rate it 6 plus star, it's perfect. Must try!   Wild mushroom, sherry: 5 star, when this fish first came out, I thought the bottom is mashed potato but it's not, it tasted like a combination of Egg and grits. A spoonful of the grits with some mishroom together tasted so good!   I didn't see the check but I think it's around 120? Totally worth the price!",

I made reservations and we were seated immediately. Our server was outstanding. She knew the menu very well, checked on us often, and provided us with great conservation but also gave us space to enjoy time to ourselves too. Here's what we ordered:  Prosciutto Pizza with arugula, pecorino, and mozzarella Garganelli with genovese pesto and grilled prawns   The pizza was great with a soft crust and plenty of prosciutto. But the star of the show... hands down, the garganelli with grilled prawns! The prawns were fresh, the pesto well seasoned, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.The new head chef, Daniel Stramm, personally came out and checked on us as well! Now that's amazing service! He took the time to let us know that it was his first week as executive chef and that he just created the menu. We shared back that we were quite impressed with his food, glad that he came out to introduce himself, and enjoyed every moment. It was the perfect night!",

From the start of our dinner until the end of our dinner everyone was extremely friendly. They definitely embody the idea of service in the culinary industry. As for the food everything was delicious!  Rigatoni - Perfectly Al Dente Flavorbomb. I cannot even begin to put into words how blown away I was by this dish. The pasta sauce was balanced. It was acidic but didn't give me instant heartburn; there was the perfect amount of creaminess mixed into the sauce; there was a really apparent meaty flavor in the sauce that just added another layer into this intricate palate of this dish. My girlfriend rarely finishes her food. We can go to fancy places and she'll eat half then pack some home. When we came here she finished her own portion AND finished the rest of mine. Thats how great this place is!  House Bread and Olive Oil - The best compliment to hunger. Their house bread is baked fresh daily and it sure does taste like it! When paired with the rich olive oil and some balsamic vinaigrette I LOVED it.",

The mix of fresh apple, blackberries and raspberries was a hit for her. I had the Spaghetti Polpette. The blend of the marinara and the meatballs were superb. My friend had the Pesto Genovese with Chicken. She said the chicken breast was flavorful and not dry. Both of us were too full for dessert.",

In the less populated Crystals Shopping Center in Aria, the setting is quieter, relaxed, and perfect for a special occasion. If you're entering on the Northside second floor walkway that connects to Cosmopolitan, stay to the left; you'll find it near the Starbucks.   We started in the bar. They have a separate small bites menu and really special complimentary kettle chips. At the table, they have fantastic onion focaccia and French bread to nibble on.   For dinner, we shared the frito misto appetizer- perfect! and I tried the spicy lobster linguine while Taylor had a Margherita pizza.   Service was just as great. They worked as a seamless team and made sure our experience was memorable and celebratory. I wanted to save a piece of focaccia with my leftovers and they gladly offered to give me some (4 fresh pieces) to go! Then a manager took extra care to make sure we had great pictures to remember our evening.   We have already talked about potential opportunities to go back and I'm sure it will happen in the near future!",

The restaurant is located inside the Crystal Gardens Shoppes so we were seated near the railing where we could people watch and see people staring at the expensive store displays. If you are seated here it does not have the same ambiance as some of the other seating options, felt almost mall food court like. In addition our table was very low and it was at times challenging to eat from it for two tall people. For these two reasons I am deducting half a star. Other than that, the dining experience itself was wonderful. We had the margherita pizza, the eggplant parmesan, drinks, and a dessert. Everything was fantastic and delicious.

She was super friendly and welcoming, quick with gray recommendations and always checking on us to make sure that we were happy. She was great!  We each had a pizza. I customized a basic pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. It was fantastic! I ate every bite.   We saw a foursquare tip to order White Sangria. We had a pitcher and it was amazing. Even if you don't plan on eating here, go to the bar and have the Sangria, trust me.   My husband ordered the cookie selection for dessert and loved them so much, that we bought more to take home to California. They were the best ginger snaps that he had ever eaten.  Our server even gave me an extra glass of iced tea in a to-go cup.  Great service, great food and nice vibe. I look forward to dining here again!",

They have a great selection of pastas and pizzas in a very bright, clean open air restaurant in the Crystals Mall.

The starters are all fantastic, love the carbonara, and the arugula pizza.",

I love when places refill your drinks promptly, take our money promptly, and get us on our way.  It's a nice date ambiance so dressing up for this place would be nice, but I went casual because I was there for the Las Vegas Marathon to load up on carbs.

It wasn't my first choice since I've eaten at his restaurants several times before, but his restaurants never let me down.   I forget which cocktail I had exactly--just remember that it was good.   We had the Italian Cured Meat Platter with pepper relish (which i could have eaten by itself with a spoon) and the Wood Fired pizza with sausage, ramps, and peppers. Both were classic and delicious as expected.   Our waitress was friendly, easy-going, and prompt. And the atmosphere was very chill.",

Got the caprese salad - it had tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto and balsamic vinegarette. Expensive for a salad, it was good not great... I wish I had a bit more acid with the salad. Never getting a salad that pricey.  Got italian sausage pizza and it was good. The crust was thin and it was hot. The cheese however, fell off the pizza at times. There was little sausage and it had garlic pieces on top. I don't know what the greens were on the pizza, I think it was broccoli or something along the lines of that, but it gave a bit bitter taste because of the greens.  Overall, the place and location is in the Crystals. The place is modern and its kinda small. The service is a bit mediocre. The price is a little on the pricey side. Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in the MGM Grand is better because there are more choices to choose from and its good... better than this place.",

Too many names and confusing!  Anyway, we sat at the bar where HAPPY HOUR is offered all the time.   Bartender took his sweet time to take our order and there were only two other people sitting at the bar. It was only like 3 p.m.    It took him 15 minutes to get our drink ORDER.   We were sitting at the bar?  FINALLY he took our order, I ordered the stuffed peppers with goat cheese.  These are tiny nibbles so don't expect a huge portion. The pepper is the size of a grape.  But the flavor is fantastic.  I LOVE GOAT CHEESE. They drizzle some olive oil on it so for me, it was perfect.  We had some red sangria which I recommend and the pizza with Arugula and mushroom. That's always my go-to.  I do have to say the next bartender that came on shift was a delight and seemed more on the ball, so the knucklehead that was there earlier gets a one star!   They do serve gluten free pasta here too.  I think next time, I'll sit at a table!",

I have no idea what it is but Crystals and this open air bar delight the sense with a perfumed but subtle smell, its delicious.  If you're in the area and hungry, this is the spot to be!",

    "text": "It is the last night of our long weekend in Las Vegas.  We wanted Italian and came here based on the 4-Star Yelp review.  The food isn't here yet but I started the review anyway because of the lack of service. We sat around for over half an hour only to have water and place our drink and food order.  We weren't even served any bread.   I asked the Hostess about when we were seated and told her about our situation. She then got the Manager to check on us.  We couldn't convey our complaint right then because the Manager came over right at the same time as the server brought us the drinks.   The bread was brought out but I had to ask for small plates for the bread. The Manager later on brought out two small plates of cheese stuffed peppers to hold us over. At this time, Mr. Puck's pizzeria & cucina gets a negative 3 stars for the lack of service.  So when the food finally came, my friend's salad came at the same time as the entree. WTF?  Also, the server did not know who ordered what. We were at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar last night. The server knew exactly which one of us ordered what.  Then, we were not offered fresh cheese or peppers. Maybe it is just not their standard practice.   As far as the taste of the food is concerned, it is top-notch as always.  So the food gets 5 Stars but the poor service made the whole experience not so good.   When the bill came, the stuffed peppers were complementary, but there was no discount or free anything to make up for the seriously lackluster service. A major mistake.   With so many top restaurants in Las Vegas, I think this place seriously needs a service makeover.",

Half a salad, half pasta/pizza.    Since you are in the Crystal's, it is a bit quieter.  I had dinner around 7pm on a Thursday night at the bar with a Sofia Loren movie playing in the background.  It was a lovely meal.    By the time I left around 8, it was starting to get a bit crowded.  But food, ambiance, and staff were all pleasantly surprising.

Pizzeria & Cucina has a light, open air atmosphere and prices so reasonable that you may forget that you're in one of the most expensive shopping malls in America.

    "text": "Wow! One of the best dinner experiences I have had in a loooong time. This place made me remember what fabulous food taste like and that superb service is still out there.   Came in on a Tuesday evening around 7PM without a reservation. The hostess greeted us and we were seated immediately even though they were pretty busy.   We had two servers taking care of us. Both were wonderful and very attentive with us and the surrounding diners. They made sure our beverages were always filled, checked in to see if we had any needs, and kept us in the loop regarding our food being prepared.   To start off we ordered the house salad that had mixed greens, tomatoes and fresh parmesan cheese. They split the salad for hubs and I to share. It was a simple salad with light dressing. They serve two types of bread a fresh soft yummy onion focaccia and slice French bread. The focaccia was my favorite. Being Italian I would have been content eating a basket full of it.   Next was the meatball appetizer. It came with 8 small meatballs with a tomato and pesto sauce. The meatballs were tasty with the sauce and very moist.   About 30 minutes later our Margarita pizza arrived. It was cut into 6 slices and was pipping hot right out of the oven. A very simple and yet wonderful pie. I'm not a huge fan of thin crust pizza but this one is very good. Their sauce has a great flavor with the seasoning.   Our dinner lasted about an hour and a half. They didn't rush us in and out. We were able to take our time and enjoy each dish as it arrived. They time the courses perfectly one after another.   For the salad, meat ball app and pizza with tax total and tip total was around $52.00.",

I ended up with the burratta raviolis and bf had the chicken piccatta. We really liked the attention to detail. At one point, our waiter came by and said he had the kitchen redo my bf chicken because it was overcooked. It seem a bit strange since the kitchen was not busy but i did like that our waiter didn't wait for us to complain about it. My raviolis were really good but I think the sauce could have been better. Our waiter did a great job recommending wine. I normally don't like merlot but he recommended one. Since I mentioned i dont usually drink merlot, he asked if i would like to try a couple. He gave me a blind taste of a few, and lo and behold, I liked the merlot best.",

However, past the entrance and once settled, it reveal itself as a fairly excellent restaurant.  I've been here twice with the same group of friends. Once for dinner and once to simply enjoy apps and sangria and watch soccer. Both times, the service has been superb. Really above and beyond helpful and friendly. On the second visit, the waiting staff didn't rush us even though we were all done eating and drinking but still watching the game. Water glasses weren't just kept filled; the servers came around to fill my sangria glass for me.  A safe bet for food choice is either the chef's special or one of the pizzas. I've tried all the pizzas now and they are all excellent and easy to share. The sides such as the cauliflower and broccolini are surprisingly good.  There is a larger group room and an upscale wine list as well. One of the features I always like is being able to see into the kitchen. I don't know why, but that transparency makes me a little more at ease when I dine. If you can wrangle an area on the balcony section, it can also be a nice place to people watch.  The bathroom situation is a little weird but not enough to get upset about. Men and women are in the same basic room will individual marked water closets.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars, Overall quite nice, but a few elements were lacking.  I went to two different places with WP in the name, and they couldn't be more different from each other. One was in the airport and was a huge disappointment. This place however, is located in a mall on the strip and was quite good for a place within a mall (very upscale).  We ordered the mussels as a starter,  two pizzas, and few sangrias. The drinks were good and very refreshing.   Were were served bread and butter to start. The bread was warm, soft, and crusty, all the qualities that good bread should have. The butter was served cold, I dont know if it was because we walked in two minutes before the kitchen closed or if that the way its normally served, but that was a negative. But the bread easily made up for this.  The mussels were steamed in a chorizo and garlic broth, and were served with some garlic bread. (picture included). The chorizo pieces (of which there were plenty) were almost better than the mussels, and ofcourse this lent to and excellent broth which we sopped up with the bread.  One of the pizzas had excellent quality toppings and both were well made. I personally prefer dough which is more chewy, but the way they cook it here is not too bad either. One pizza was a margherita, and the other had arugula and mushrooms. The margherita pizza, even though it was made on a technically good base,  was a huge disappointment.  It looked like a premade wood fired frozen pizza with a chiffonade of basil thrown on top. The cheese was also not very good, and it was definitely lacking in the tomato department.  The arugula and mushroom pizza was actually quite good. We all enjoyed it. I dont know all of the factors which made it so much better, but the cheese was completely different, and the drizzle of olive oil didnt hurt either.  The service was pretty much flawless, which is a pretty big deal given that they were just about to close when we walked in.  I would definitely visit again.",

The staff were all friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. When it came to the menu prices were typical being a more upscale place and the location along the strip. The food itself was phenomenal and some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the ravioli and it was so delicate and delicious. The meatballs were also prefect and mouth watering with an amazing sauce, so good my friend wished she had ordered them herself.  Just thinking about it now makes me wish I could go back right now!",

We had great service starting with their consideration of one of our guest's allergies and their helpful service when the food took a little bit longer to prepare.  The food itself was great, we started with the shrimp scampi which was a good sized appetizer for two people consisting of the bread, toppings and a good amount of shrimp.  We each ordered the prosciutto pizza, hers without cheese and mine with cheese, both variants were very good and were sizable enough for one person each to have and still have some leftovers.  Overall, I would recommend dining here to anyone who is looking for a more upscale dining experience that still feels comfortably casual.",

WP restaurants have always been good to me and a vegetarian pizza seemed like a great idea. I really like the atmosphere of this place since its in an open area and very bright, compared to so many dimly lighted places all around vegas.   I ordered the mushroom pizza which came with thyme and arugula (finished every bit of it). My initial reaction when I saw it was that it was such a big portion. The pizza wasn't greasy and the cheese wasn't overwhelming either. The caesar salad with chicken looked appetizing as well but took a while to come out. I really wanted to save room for dessert because they had something called a zeppole that was supposed to be a delight but I just couldn't do it.   P.S. Service was definitely a highlight here!

Its sounds gross but since I never tried it and I'm a big prosciutto fan I figured I should give it a try.

    "text": "We chose this place based on Yelp rating for a Thanksgiving Day dinner.  It was a mistake.   The restaurant is in a shopping mall, but it makes the best of this location: Ambience and decoration are nice.   We made a reservation through OpenTable, but it turned out it wasn't necessary, as the place was semi-empty. The hostess seated us right away. We asked for a high chair, she said she would bring one right away, but we never saw her again.   Things started badly with a wobbling table. A waiter tried to help, but he could not fix it completely. Note: A restaurant of this class surely can afford to fix wobbling tables.   We ordered the prosciutto appetizer, the fettuccine carbonara, pappardelle with meat sauce, and some pasta with cheese for the little ones.   The $18 appetizer had some of the smallest, and certainly the thinnest slices of prosciutto I have ever seen. I like prosciutto sliced thin, but this is ridiculous. Just barely enough to taste the meat. The burrata that came with it was excellent, though.   Now, the big downer: All pasta dishes (including the plain spaghetti with cheese for the kids) were ruined by the massive, excessive amount of salt. I am not someone who avoids salt, but this was clearly too much. Maybe the B-team was in the kitchen on Thanksgiving Day, but still, there's no justification for serving such dishes.   The carbonara dish had nothing resembling classic carbonara. It felt like an improvised recipe without much coherence. The pappardelle with meat sauce were better (if you can forget about the salt).   We left without even thinking of ordering a dessert course.",

My pasta looked like they just dumped a can of tomato sauce over it (too much sauce at that), though the sauce, too, was good. The pasta, however, was way too al dente. I'd asked for Parmesan and crushed red pepper when I ordered, but didn't get it and had to wait while they went for it. I expected much better from a big-name restaurant like this. I just can't recommend Cucina, not when you can walk across the pedestrian bridge to the Cosmopolitan and enjoy great food and service at several restaurants there.",

This Wolfgang Puck location sits on the second floor of City Center, kitty corner from Brunello Cucinelli for location reference. Clean modern open decor with a lot of light. Comfortable seating.  We were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive. She introduced us to a few menu highlights and checked on us throughout the meal. I went with the butter lettuce salad topped with delicious Gorgonzola cheese, hazelnut, bacon and egg. Decided to add some grill chicken for protein (aka, coat the stomach for more drinking. Hey when in Vegas...). It was exactly what I wanted. Light, but tasty and fulfilling. The Hazelnut added a wonderful flavor to to the dish. Also on the table were the Endive salad, Chicken Piccata and steamed clams Linguine; all very well done according to everyone.   I highly recommend WP Pizzeria & Cucina for a light lunch or easy dining. Prices were very fair (compare to other established Vegas restaurants). I wouldn't say it's a culinary experience, but the food is well-done and the atmosphere and service were top notch.",

We enjoyed an array of fabulous items such as the minestrone soup, fried calamari, burata mozzarella and prosciutto, caress salad and a selection of meats and cheeses for appetizer. All was wonderful. Entrees were even more impressive with NY strip, burata mozzarella ravioli, sea bass and of course other pasta selections. The food is excellent and wine selections are great. By far however was our server Tony!  Top notch and we all highly recommend this restaurant but if you're fortunate to find find him ask for his area!!  Thank you for a wonderful time!!",

With a group of 21 ladies, I was worried about prices and making sure everyone would be happy with the menu; however, our experience here surpassed all my expectations!  While I don't remember our server's name (maybe Tim or Tom??), he was absolutely fantastic!  The choices for wine, cocktails, apps, and main courses ended up being perfect and our server was extremely helpful when it came to ordering enough small plates that would satisfy our large party.   The location was perfect as we were staying at the Cosmo, and the one thing that really stood out for me was that there was no need to make a deposit prior or meet a required minimum upon dining.  That was the only issue I found with other restaurants since we were such a large group.  After having 4 bottles of wine, mixed drinks, a handful of apps, a main entree, and some dessert/coffee, our final cost was about $1600 - not bad at all for a group our size!    Organizing big group dinners can be a challenge, and Cucina was truly outstanding.  I highly recommend!!",

    "text": "I had never tried a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and I always try to have at least one nice meal while I'm in Vegas, so this seemed to fit the mold nicely. It was a nice experience, and although I'm not sure I would rush back, it is not because of the experience, but just based on the fact that there are so many other restaurants in the genre to try in Vegas.   I have to say, the one thing that absolutely made the experience was our waiter. The guy was good. from the very beginning to the very end, he was an absolute professional, and very good at what he did. His energy and enthusiasm did not wane, and he always made me feel as if I was his only table. That is the mark of a good waiter. He was also incredibly attentive and knowledgeable about his product.   The restaurant itself, depending on your perspective, is in a nice and accessible location. It is right in a mall between the Cosmo and Aria/Vdara. It is an upscale mall, and the atmosphere is very relaxing and low key. It is an open design restaurant on the second floor, and overlooks the mall, so there is plenty to look at, but the second floor location keeps it quiet and private. Overall, it is a nice spot as long as you're not disappointed that it's not right on the main strip or its own building.   The food itself was good. I have the woodfired sausage and cheese pizza, and I thought it was wonderful. My girlfriend had the egg plant Parmesan, and she thought it was good, although it wasn't the best she's had. The appetizer was a cheese and cold cut plate, and I thought that was one of the best parts! The prices were somewhat expensive, but I expected that being Las Vegas and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. You have to pay if you want to play.   Overall, this was a nice restaurant, although I'm not sure I would rush back there on the next trip. I would, however, try one of his other restaurants!",

If they had backed down on the salt, I think we would have had a pleasant meal. Notably, they had half off wine bottles when we went which sounded amazing. Sadly our Zin wasn't great, and the waiter brought it out in an ice bucket to keep it chilled. I've never seen red wine iced in my life...

They were getting some work done at the Starbucks in the Crystals mall when I rolled out, and I decided to grab a pre-made sandwich just to throw something at my hunger. When I got there, I noticed Cucina right upstairs, and ended up treating myself to a decadent solo lunch.  Cucina is a casual Wolfgang Puck restaurant, an open space in the middle of the Crystals shopping center, a sort of food courty floor plan with tables and a bar but no walls. It was all but empty at noon on a Monday, and it felt totally natural to sit at the bar and eat alone. The bartender was friendly and welcoming, and he knew when to chat and when to leave me to eat and read my book.  It was a pretty perfect lunch, a plate of spaghetti and a glass of white wine. The house white was crisp and tasty, and I believe priced for happy hour, and I loved the spaghetti a la pomodoro. The pasta was super satisfying, cooked a spot-on al dente, tossed with an acidic tomato sugo and parmesan. I added on meatballs, and these were great, too, tender and beautifully flavored. This was just a luxurious treat, and it made me feel pampered and wonderful.  That was the day before the election, and unfortunately, I had to tarnish this lovely memory with a return visit the night of November 8, for a party that did not feel like a party. I sat at the bar surrounded by other thunderstruck Democrats watching the votes roll in, and drank several whiskeys.  I still think fondly of Cucina, and of that last blissful lunch before the election. That spaghetti was remarkably delicious, and I hope to eat it again on a happier trip to Vegas.",

Another one of Wolfgang Puck's establishments, Cucina is a small upscale restaurant right next to Starbucks. By the way, that Starbucks is not owned by corporate so your Starbucks promo cards might not work if you go there. I made a reservation through Open Table which they happily accommodated.  -As a shareable starter, we ordered the Bruschetta (tomato, pesto, aged balsamic, parmesan) $11.  -I ordered the Rigatoni (bolognaise, ricotta salata) $23. I was more of craving for a specific bolognaise (veal-pork) which I did not find in this restaurant. The rigatoni was okay, nothing special.  -My significant other ordered the Eggplant Parmesan (spaghetti \"cacio e pepe\") $25. It was served in separate plates and there was plenty of pasta to share. -We didn't order any alcohol since our hotel was quite far from this area but there was a bar in the middle of the restaurant. They offer a good variety of bubbles, white, red, and dessert wines to choose from.",

Good food, warm and generous service and smart pricing.   Love love the Wild Boar Pasta, Caesar Salad, meat balls, bruschetta, shrimp scampi and calamari.... trust me I have eaten a lot of Italian food everywhere and this particular restaurant keeps pulling us back in.   I would make one suggestion:  add a scoop of homemade ricotta with the meatballs.   The manager always remembers us.... AND my Favorite bartender in all of Las Vegas is Matt!",

    "text": "Hmmm... pretty disappointing dinner experience. 7pm reservations with prompt seating. Got water service right away but about 10 minutes more before our waiter came to take our drink order. Since we wanted to leave close to 8:15 to catch a show, we gave our dinner order at the same time.   I ordered the $35 dinner prix fixe (risotto app-yummy but like a full entree and this choice was an add-on price --guess I missed this), salmon entree (pretty good but also had an add-on price), and the donuts); hubby ordered the bruschetta app and the shrimp scampi (small shrimp more like a bay shrimp-the sauce was lacking garlic or anything flavorful); guests ordered chicken parm (seemed to be a huge portion with what I believe was a beautiful basil topping); and the kale salad (walnuts and other fab goodies), a side of grilled potatoes, and a side of garlic cheese bread. After about 20 minutes two of us received our apps. Then we waited ...and waited.   Our water glasses were kept filled but after another 15 minutes we asked about our order --which finally arrived a full hour after we placed our order or an hour ten since we arrived. Since this was the time we wanted to exit, we scarfed our meals. The waiter did not return to ask how our food was or if we wanted another drink or anything else. We asked our water server to bring a roll or bread to accompany the scampi, but it never came.   At about 8:30 we flagged our waiter and asked for to-go boxes for my entree and the desert. We paid for the bill (after sorting out the extra costs in the prix fixe order), and then dashed to our show... which we made just as the lights came down. Having been a fan of the original Wolfgang Puck restaurant on Sunset in LA, I am sorry to learn that his chain restaurants lack any of the wow from the flagship. ...sniff...",

O my lordy, the polenta is out of this world.  Seriously.  Even if you're not a polenta fan, you want this. Trust me.  We got the budino trio for desert, and I love the addition of the pistachio flavor....  Excellent wine list, excellent, speedy, friendly service-- when you eat here, you will love it!",

    "text": "I never thought in my wildest dream that a salad would leave such an impression on me.  The pecorino salad with lemon-herb dressing was the dish that I had to have it all to myself. It was selfishly good.  The key to bringing the crispy duck and the fresh spring mix together was the delightful citrus dressing.  It was the perfect amuse bouche!  Unfortunately the dream ended when I ate the grilled rare tuna burger.  The texture of the tuna was so rare that it felt like slimy paste...not to mention it was over-seasoned.    This place was very posh and it fits well in the high-end City Center.   I came on dead Wednesday night, so the service was quick.   Brasserie Pucks name comes with a cost, so do bring many shiny pennies.   Overall, the delicious salad is not enough incentive for me to go back, But hey!  At least I know super tasty salads exists in this world.",

The eggplant Parmesan was good and crunchy (thank you Panko breading) but not quite moist, fine either way. The side pasta was good also, not sure if it was cooked in butter or olive oil, perhaps some other sauce, it was comforting enough. Finally, I am usually biased for big portions and I was scared when I saw the dish sizes but surprisingly, it quite filling and just right!

The sangria was the best I've had; it was a perfect blend of ingredients with just enough brandy for a good kick. We all ordered different meals and were all happy with the quality. Everything was fresh, delicious, and very well presented. They even made my salad interesting with just the right proportions of dressing, Gorgonzola, bacon and nuts. In my book, it takes a really good kitchen to make a salad that tasty. Our server was very good. She was friendly and professional without being intrusive on our fun lunch.  I'm a fan and can happily recommend this place. Get a window seat so you can people-watch. :)",

My husband and I noticed that both chicken parmesan and chicken piccata were on the menu, along with veal scallopini. We both love veal, so we asked if they'd be willing to make veal parm and veal piccata instead - the chef accommodated and our meals were excellent!

Probably one of of the least expensive places to dine in Crystals (which still will set you back $25-$30 a plate) and it also has a nice view to people watch while you dine. We made reservations before going and were quickly seated. The server was friendly but forgettable. I didn't partake in any spirits but my iced tea was very good. Everything on the menu looked splendid but I ended up settling on the Veal Scallopini, Mushrooms, Artichokes, and Parmesan. Since this dish had very little carbohydrates and my fat stores needed further fuel I decided to order their creamy polenta with Parmesan reggiano. Yum Yum. The veal was very good but not the best I have ever had. Cooked perfectly though. I had to steal some bites from my fellow diners and the sea bass and lamb were some of the best I have ever tasted. No room for dessert. Probably one of the better meals I had in Las Vegas but not quite enough for that coveted 5 stars. If you can't afford anything in Crystals you can at least eat here and pretend you are rich.",

The 3 of us decided to order bruschetta as appetizers and split two pizzas which were more than enough food for us. The bruschetta was delicious! The crostini perfectly toasted and the tomato and basil toppings were fresh and flavorful. The pizzas were delicious as well. We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the mushroom and carmelized onion. The prosciutto pizza was the best one. Thinly sliced, arugula, cheese, great combo. Considering its a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, we wouldnt have expected less of this place.",

We mentioned that we were running late and that we had tickets to the show and they were very accommodating. Our food was brought out in less than 20 minutes (we ordered pasta and no appetizer) and it was delicious. Not the best Spaghetti Pomodoro I've ever had, but it was certainly fulfilling.  I was very surprised to see how empty it was at 8:30 on a Friday night, but then again, it was inside a shopping center, so it was a quiet escape from busy Las Vegas.",

They constantly came around to check up on us Ordered the caesar salad, pretty damn tasty. Ordered the fried calamari, they were flight and not heavy on the batter. Best calamari I've had. I enjoyed the green dipping sauce. Dont really know what it's made from, but it was good I ordered the veal ravioli with mushrooms. Pretty good, a bit salty but very filling GF ordered the lasagna. \"Feels homemade. This is how lasagna should be.\" Her words, not mine Was going to order the tiramisu but GF ran out of room. But I saw someone else ordered it and it had a side of chocolate dipping sauce. Looked good  Overall great experience. Kind of pricy, but it's expected from since we were in vegas. Randomly came to this place because we were getting hungry and chose this spot. Great gamble!",

The Margherita pizza during dinner time was tasty, but didn't have anything differentiating about itself compared to Spinatos or Zachary's...it wasn't as \"good\" or \"original\" compared to those two. The cheese and the grease gave me a slight stomach ache.   The butter lettuce with the Gorgonzola cheese and bacon was phenomenal, however!   For lunch, the starters: Steamed Mussels and the bruschetta are worth a try. Those steamed mussels are pretty tasty; almost comes close to the italians seafood I've enjoyed in Boston.",

We stopped in for an early dinner,  just on a whim as passing by.  We sat at the bar and were waited on by a wonderful, friendly bartender - Shawn.  We started out with a charcuterie for one (don't believe - definitely sharable)  $12 - what a deal!  We then ordered two misa salads with four meatballs and a small side of spaghetti . ALL were fantastic. Best meatballs I've ever had.  Of course accompanied with Chianti. Finished off with cappuccino which came with a delightful chocolate candy.

    "text": "Note: This review was based on a wonderful Happy Hour Experience  Wolfgang Puck Pizzaria & Cucina offers a great \"ALL-DAY Happy Hour! It's located in the famous Crystall Gallery Shopping Center, which is a great attraction itself!  In this Gallery Styled, high-end Shopping Mall, WPPC also has an aesthetic appeal with eye pleasing, modern, inviting setting. The serving staff, especially the barkeeps were friendly, humorous and efficient.  WPPC has a large, comfortable bar (S Steel) with a partial view of the beautiful mall. One of its tv's over the bar counter is a thin-glass projection type, which looks like a piece of art! The restaurant is moderate in size, but has a spacious feel with its modern, comfortable tables and lounges. Those by the windows overlook the gorgeous gallery shopping area below.  One evening in late March, my wife and I enjoyed ourselves tremendously over 2 glasses of house red wine ($7@), a draft beer ($5), a Spicy Pepperoni Pizza ($14), and a plate of assorted Marinated Olives ($7), which was much bigger in size than we expected. We came for HH only and did not try the dinner menu.  - For its nice ambience, good food, and attractive location, we were not surprised to see quite a few locals there, at the bar that evening! The Crystal Gallery Shooping Center and the WPPC will defintely be one place we'll bring our out-of-town guests to for a good time!  Additional Info - Go visit this fabulous Crystal Center, even if you don't eat/drink at WPPC! - Crystall Shopping Center itself has a modern, artistic architecture with unique aesthetic design, totally worth a visit for tourists and locals alike! This mall is like a gallery with beautiful sculptures, fountain tubes, ornate staircases.... To get to the mall, one can ride the free CityCenter Tram, from Bellagio to the Crystall stop, or to the Aria/Monte Carlo stop, from where then walk around to visit a couple of NICE galleries (Glass Blowing by Chihuly; Sculptures by McDonald) along the way; followed by walking on the picturesque overpass/footbridge to the Mall.  My wife and I spent a pleasant afternoon walking in the CityCenter - the Aria, the galleries, the Crystall Shopping Center, and happily ended our wonderful evening at the Wolfgang Puck over good food and drinks!

So I could not afford the restaurants in the hotel  and the buffet was not appetizing. I am so glad Cucina was a few steps away. I went there Tuesday night at 8 PM and was seated quickly. The place was about 2/3 full.   I had a glass of red wine, an order of spaghetti and a side of (3 large!) meatballs. Total: $35. I had to box two of the meatballs for I was full. And I even had enough money to get some nice coffee after my meal.   The spaghetti is full on flavor, with the gentle tang from tomato, a savory aftertaste and good olive oil. The place is mellow, you can actually have a conversation without shouting in the other person's ear.   It's elegant comfort from the decor to the food.",

One of the best Cesar Salads I have every had, dressed perfectly, crispy salad and yummy anchovies.   I also had a great mushroom pizza which was spot on.  Really great food for a reasonable price!!",

Adam, our server, was spectacular- hard to determine which was better - the delectable food or attentive server!   We started with the small meat and cheese board, which was the perfect amount for two to share. For our entrees we had the chicken piccata and the pappardelle. Both were delicious! We were treated to complimentary dessert (zeppole) in honor of my birthday. Oh my goodness were they yummy!!! Make sure you save room!!!  We will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas!",

Started with the white sangria, which is the best I've tasted in Vegas. Lots of alcohol, not too sweet.  Waiters brought us apps on apps on apps.  - Mussels in chorizo sauce was BEYOND MAJOR. At first, I wasn't even going to try it because I don't like mussels. Tried the mussels and was in like. But, THAT SAUCE blew me away. It was so hearty and flavorful, I wanted to bathe in it. Waiter even asked us if we wanted more bread for it. - Pork and Beef meatballs. Ridiculously juicy and no need for the sauces they came with. - Pork belly. Not too salty and the picked garnish it came with went sooooo well with it. My 2nd fave after the mussels.  After all those apps, I was too full to even order anything. My boyfriend ordered the salmon, which is a never fail at any restaurant. The pea puree it came with was weird to think about but, tasted amazing.  Shockingly ordered dessert after all the food; and so glad I did. The donut (holes) were steller. I think they were lemon flavor bcuz of the bits of rind in them. They came with a chocolate and carmel sauce -- THAT caramel...SO GOOD!   p.s. Get a booth by the outside. Views of Crystal are pretty!",

Then I had the mushroom ravioli ....i don't know why the chef put peas in this meal because I don't find match between peas and mushroom. Espacily if the mushroom outside the pasta and not inside. Inside the ravioli was chees..they say on the menu it's parmesan but it was really sour...so, I'm not sure a bout that. Atleast I got termisu cake was OK LIKE regular diner bit more then that. Everything was 25 $..but after 2 hours I will be hungry again.. one more very important thing. It was taking forever to the food to come out. So it makes all the experience even worse.

    "text": "We were looking for a casual dinner on the first night of our staycation at Mandarin Oriental, so we chose this restaurant inside of Crystals. We were impressed by the modern dining room and, although casual, there was a taste of elegance in the warm, inviting decor. And since it's pretty open on the second floor of Crystals, you can do some good people-watching while you dine.   My husband called ahead and told them we were celebrating my birthday (which was the next day). The hostess greeted me by name and wished me a happy birthday, which I thought was nice. Everyone was extremely attentive throughout the entire meal. Waters never went empty, we were never left alone for long, and they checked on us frequently without being overbearing.   We tried the Caesar salad, chicken piccata, and margherita pizza. All were delicious. I don't like capers, but I pushed them to the side of the chicken and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The pizza was very good - fresh tasting sauce and cheese on a softer crust and, although I've never been, it's what I imagine a fresh pizza would taste like in Italy. For dessert we tried the zeppoles. What an interesting take on a simple Italian dessert. They were filled with a creamy orange custard and served with caramel dipping sauce. Delightful! They had a very nice wine list and a full bar (happy hour at the bar all day, every day. If I'm in the area I'll definitely stop in for a drink and a nosh!).   Also, this restaurant has a \"Compliments of the Chef\" locals program in place that entitles locals to preferred seating, priority reservations, and a free dessert per couple. Just tell them you're local!",

Professional and friendly wait staff. Quiet location away from noisy,smelly casinos. Good food, mostly. Our entrees were very good. My husband had pizza and I chose eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant was crispy and flavorful, although the tomato sauce was a bit bland. The tiramisu dessert was packed with flavor. There were a couple negatives in our one dining experience here. On the negative side: the salad (ensalada misto) was so over-dressed I could not eat it. I love balsamic vinegar, but not that much! I couldn't find our waiter to complain, but I did mention it to the second waiter bringing bread and filling water glasses, as she took away my mostly filled salad plate. She either didn't mention my \"inedible\" comment to our waiter, or no one cared.   To go along with my tiramisu dessert, I ordered decaf coffee. The first cup was excellent. I commented to my husband that it was the best decaf I ever tasted. I eagerly accepted the offer of a refill. The waiter took away my cup, and 3-5 minutes later, came back with a full cup that was frothy and tasted like instant. Yuck.  The first cup was either caffeinated or was brewed decaf.  Either way, I was sorry that the second cup left yucky taste in my mouth after a mostly very good meal.",

All the dishes were delicious. We had the prie fix meal. Adults enjoyed several pitchers of sangria. Kids all ordered pizzas. However where cucina fell short was on serving size and service. Serving size was small on all shared dishes even for the salad. Dessert was laughable 2 tiny gelato balls for 5 adults ( the same size they brought out for table of two nearby). If not for the adults snagging some of the kids extra Pizza, and several extra desserts ordered for the kids, we would have left hungry.  The service was spotty, definitely not attentive or forward looking. No serving silverware for family style platters. Slow refills on water,  no refills on kids drinks. No clearing of dishes. We had several different servers  yet none really delivered and restaurant was not busy. Eggplant Parmesan was the fav but overall meal was below expectations. The kicker- did not honor yelp coupon because summer dinner special.  Loved the gender neutral bathroom! Loved the easy and free valet parking! Bummed the value and service were not to expectations.",

They offer happy hour specials all night at the bar, which was actually convenient to sit at with our party of 4 as we grabbed a corner seat so that 2 people sat on each side and we were able to talk to each other easily. The happy hour menu offered some pretty good deals, a pitcher of sangria (red or white) for $18 and pale ales for $6. The handsome bartender was extremely friendly and chatty as he refilled our glasses of sangria and beer.   The food we ordered was surprisingly good. We had mushroom arancini for just $6 off the happy hour \"bites\" menu, calamari fritti, a insalata mista with grape tomatoes and parmesan, and a margharita pizza. While the pizza may not compare to the stuff in NYC, the marinara sauce tasted surprisingly fresh and tangy.   It was definitely nice to rewind here and get our buzz going after checking into the Aria without breaking the bank.",

For a party of over 20, service went smoothly from the the taking of our orders to the splitting of the checks and everything in between.   In addition to the service, the food here was wonderful. The server brought out two types of bread- Ciabatta and a fluffier, more rustic bread that everyone seemed to prefer. We asked for more of the good stuff, but the server noted that they were all out since it was close to the end of the night. Bummer!   No need to pout, however, as our food arrived just in time. I ordered the Steamed Mussels- 15 or so mussels from New Zealand steamed in a delicious white wine/tomato sauce with diced chorizo, garlic, and marjoram (herb), served with a grilled ciabatta slice lovingly brushed with olive oil. The mussels came out bubbling in a cast iron pan, remaining warm till the very last mollusk. The only hiccup of this dish was that two of the mussels weren't open. Other than that, I enjoyed this dish and thought it perfect as an entree.   I also tried a bite of the Sea Bass dish, which was delicious. The skin of the bass was pan seared beautifully, resulting in a crispy skin that was good and contrasted nicely with the meat of the sea bass, which was so tender and melt in your mouth. Adding to the delicateness of the fish was the cream sauce that lay on top. I also tried the Italian Sausage Pizza- Rapini (Broccoli Rabe), Carmelized Garlic, Sausage, Mozzarella Cheese and Pecorino Romano atop a thin, soft pizza dough- which was flavorful and delicious.   One of my favorite parts of the meal was how the checks were split. Each check had 5/6 people's orders, and each order's total (including tax and tip) was separate from the other totals. This made paying very easy and hassle-free. I didn't have to do any calculations, except counting the money for our table.   Can't wait to try out their happy hour!",

    "text": "Vegas ain't cheap. It can be really difficult to have a solid meal for under $50 a person. I looked at the menu for Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina and couldn't pass up the possibility of a good meal at very reasonable price.   Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria is hidden within Crystals at City Center so we really wouldn't have found it if we didn't research restaurants in preparation for our trip. When planning our list of dining options, I discovered a fabulous secret: all day happy hour. Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria offers all day happy hour at the bar which includes amazing deals on small plates and drinks. As there were only two of us, we walked right in and sat at the bar.   We proceeded to order an insane amount of food including calamari, an insalata mista, gnocchi, and the lamb chorizo pizza. The calamari was crispy and delicious, one of the best I have had. It was served with a garlic aioli which made a fabulous dip. We received our salad shortly after finishing our calamari and were pleased but not wowed. It was a pretty basic salad with cherry tomatoes and parmesan but it was very well dressed. After finishing the salad we were happy to see a huge plate of gnocchi and a very large pizza, perfect for sharing. The gnocchi was one of the best I have had, served with a flavorful sausage bolognese, and the portion size was HUGE! The pizza was certainly upstaged by the gnocchi but still very good. The chorizo was tasty and I really loved the crust.   We received our bill and were thrilled to see that it came to somewhere around $75-$80, a steal in Vegas! The food was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to someone wanting a delicious, casual meal in Vegas. Why four stars? Our waiter who was actually a bartender, was pretentious an inattentive. We did not receive any of the delicious bread people rave about and we barely saw him the entire time we were there! He was chatting and laughing with another party seated on the other side of the bar. That night I was very thankful for food runners because if there were none, we would've never eaten. This didn't seem to be an issue with every waiter/bartender, just ours so don't let this stop you from going.",

Great service, from the hostess to our busser that I'm presuming was in training. He was doing a great job, but the manager was pulling him aside every once in awhile to clarify details. The food is always great, especially the pizzas, but I thought my salad was overdressed. Still it's never disappointing at any of his concepts. I'll see you again next time Wolfgang.",

The menu is a bit different from some of the other Pucks and the Spaghetti & Shrimp is my favorite. Service is usually good but can be spotty. I live at Veer condo right above Crystals so they give me 20% off. I think they may extend that courtesy to all locals. Great place to have both a business lunch or a romantic dinner.  UPDATE: I had to downgrade my review because this place is inside Crystals and Crystals is not a place that is very welcoming.",

Service was really top notch (the kind you would get at a $$$$ dinner) and the food was good. Ruben and I started with drinks - I got the Pineapple Ginger Mojito, refreshing, light, and delicious. We shared the Calamari served with marinara and pesto aioli. A tad salty, but the breading was lovely and the sauces were wonderful! Then we shared one of the wood-fired pizzas with spicy pepperoni, ricotta, Calabrian hot peppers, and oregano. The dough was delicious and I loved the crust on it, however, the toppings were not as exciting as it sounded on the menu. And I was torn between three selections. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu and it was fabulous! Definitely one of the best tiramisus I've had yet! The mascarpone cheese had little milk chocolate balls suspended in it and those added an unique texture to the delicate dessert. It was a wonderful experience and I definitely want to try other pizzas and maybe some pastas next time, however, I had to give it three stars right now since comparatively to other Italian or pizza joints, not my favorite execution.",

And when he opened CUT steakhouse I felt like it was ok but just very well marketed. Food was not as good as people said it was. And now we're here at possibly the worst pasta I've had in all of my life. I'm embarrassed to even say it. I love food. So it has to be bad for me not to finish it. But if it's good I will praise it to next levels. Some people forget I've had food channels and even CNN do features on me about spots to eat at and I wish I could show them the bad places too. I ordered the prefix lunch and the prosciutto was not fresh or tasty. Ok. Fine. Next course. Chicken parmesan which was not so bad. Maybe a 7 Out Of 10. But then I ate the spaghetti and it was a 1 Out of 10 legit. Cmon. This is a restaurant with Wolfgang's name on it??? I should have just walked further and ate at Carbone. They never disappoint. But overall the food was terrible. And it's Italian food which is embarrassing to Wolfgang's name. I will not only never eat here again. I will make sure nobody I know or who follows me on my actual larger social media pages knows to avoid this place. The service was pretty d decent. My actual waiter did a great job. But the food was bad. I also think Crystals should be embarrassed to have such a poor tasting restaurant inside their premier mall.",

Very tentative to meet in our needs. We were in a hurry so Apollo hooked it up in the kitchen and expedited our order. The margahretti pizza was delicious and we shared a cesar salad which they split in to two for us. The ladies enjoyed the service the atmosphere and attention we got. Will def return on a next visit.",

The calamari was beyond tender and the aioli dipping sauce paired with it perfectly. Spaghetti and rigatoni were both fantastic and full of flavor, they were also large portions. Meatballs literally melted in our mouths and the garlic bread was nice & crispy/crunchy on the outside and soft & buttery on the inside. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who loves Italian food!!",

We waited way more than 25 minutes to get our food. They couldn't even cook a steak correctly. Every chef should know how to cook a steak medium rare-- If you can't, I'm sorry but you don't cut it. We both ordered steak and both came out with almost no pink-- I didn't want to eat it. Not when you're spending over $40 for a NY strip.  They tried explaining to us that it is to temperature as if we were stupid.. So they cooked two new steaks, told us it would take 12 minutes. SHOCKER since it took more than 25 minutes the first time. We get the second round and we decided to eat it even though the meat didn't rest AT ALL and you could tell by the look of it. It was slightly more pink than the first one. My SO and I switched plates because his was better looking than mine. (eventually, with resting it, it looked fine) but completely mad they didn't know what they were doing. They have 6 or 8 Entrees, pasta, and pizza--how is this complicated?  I felt bad for the waiter but we were there for almost an hour and a half. To me, in Vegas, that's the last thing I want to be doing--waiting around for someone who can't cook a steak.",

    "text": "We finally made it to a Puck branded restaurant and, overall, this was a very good and enjoyable meal.  We started with a Caprese \"salad\" which had a nice array of different tomatoes, but it was woefully lacking in fresh basil. It also included a decent portion of cheese, but they don't use fresh mozarella. I'm not clear what it was, but if definitely was NOT mozarella.  My wife ordered the Veal Scallopini which was very good. The melted mozarella over the veal was a nice touch. But it was just the entree, with a decent portion of mushrooms topping it. A bit of polenta, or perhaps steamed broccoli would have seemed fitting for the price.  I was lured into trying an off menu special consisting of a 12oz boneless ribeye with sauteed brussels sprouts and pearl onions. It was a VERY good meal. The steak was precisely medium rare, as ordered, and the flavor and texture was spot on.  Only few small knocks...   First, they should clarify and then be consistent with \"Sunday Supper\" being available for parties of four or more. The menu says no such thing. We learned upon by inquiring and didn't press the issue. A couple who arrived a few minutes later, and was seated across from us made the same inquiry and received the same response. However, seconds later the waiter (same as ours) said \"let me see what I can do\". A few moments later he emerged from the kitchen with news that since the kitchen was super busy they would go ahead and serve them the \"Sunday Supper\". WTH??? You made no such offer or effort for us Dave.  Second, its offseason in Las Vegas at the moment, but their website STRONGLY suggests reservations be made at least 48 hours in advance. We had no difficulty getting a same day reservation and the place wasn't even close to packed. It barely qualified as busy.  Finally, this is not really a knock against Cucina as it is against The Shops at Crystals. We're not wealthy, nor are we dirt poor. We're just plain, solid, working class souls. We dress, carry and conduct ourselves very well. Yet we were repeatedly snubbed and refused service or attention at all but one of the stores where we stopped to admire their wares. The shops are all super high end, and clearly intended for the upper class elite - but that doesn't excuse snubbing us. We felt just like Julia Robert's character in Pretty Woman. We were judged without knowing us. And, truth be told, we could have easily dropped many thousands of dollars in one or more shops that night - had we been welcome.",

This time I was a little disappointed, which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  The host was not friendly at all.  The server was very friendly and helpful at first.  Then he said, \"If you need me I'll be around. I don't want you to wait for anything.\"  I got a bad feeling and sure enough, he disappeared and I had to ask a busboy to find him twice.  Anyway, the food was excellent.  They wine list is excellent and has one of my all time favorites by the glass.  Seghesio Zinfandel.  I will be back next time I'm in town.",

Pros:  happy hour at the bar all day, so some food items, wings, cheese, meats for $6-8 and drinks (sangria -white/red -$6 and three varietal of wines ranging from $5-8 a glass as well as beer)  Pasta dishes are pretty amazing, we had the pappardelle and linguine with seafood and white wine.  Cons:  the pizza we had was nice and crispy as requested but wasn't amazing - margarita - possibly the prosciutto with arugula may be a better choice or the mushroom with a hen egg.  The free bread is also quite fresh however our server was pretty slammed so we had to request it rather than getting it while we waited, we actually got it after getting our pizza and we sat for about 10-15 minutes before we got that. So that takes it down one star and I had to ask multiple times for a water refill. So although service is decent when he is not slammed but over the impression that there was more care to the four top next to us because they had a lot of specific needs.   Pricing wise- it's decent for the location, considering every store in this mall is high retail and brand name only. You would expect clientele that can afford to be in there.",

Stopped in for a lunch with a colleague and couldn't believe how quick we got in during the CES show and right in the middle of lunch. We ordered a pizza, a bowl of minestrone soup, a salad and the cheese ravioli. All great portion sizes at great prices. Served Hot and fresh to the table. As busy as it was the waiter was attentive to refills, asking if we needed more items, pre bussing the table and more. I would recommend to anyone Looking for a great Italian lunch. Located inside the crystals shops next to Aria hotel.",

We had two kids and he never offered us a kids menu.  After we ordered, the food started to come, I asked the busboy if they have a kids menu and our waiter brought it over and say \"you wanted a kids menu?\" The menu was folded and gave it to us.  BTW out kids are 6 and 9, so it wasn't like we had big kids that kids menu doesn't apply.  The menu is super limited - even after I mentioned it, the waiter still didn't say anything.  After our food came, we overheard the table next to us, a different waiter was telling the customers 3 different specials that was not on the menu - 2 different types of steak and the Gnocchi specials - which was never mentioned to us when we were ordering.  It's a shame we never even had the opportunity to try the special - oh wait we didn't even get to hear it!  The restaurant was 20% occupied and the waiter never came and ask if everything is ok?  We have to wave the busboy for more water.  Correction - the waiter took our order, gave me the kids menu after I requested it and gave us our check.  Also, no dessert was offered at this Italian restaurant- at least no option was offered to us.  We felt discriminated!!  Absolutely a terrible experience.  We will never come back or any of the Wolfgang chains even though the food was decent - there are so many other options in Vegas.  This is when I don't agree with the 15% tips!",

The calamari was cooked perfectly and had a great garlic aioli to accompany it.  Since we dined there on a Thursday, it was Gnocchi night and I decided to go with their daily special, the Veal Gnocchi. I was tempted to try their Ribeye which was the other daily special but decided on something lighter. The veal was cooked perfectly and flavorful but I wasn't so much a fan of their Gnocchi. My coworkers who ordered the ribeye said that it was very good.   Overall, the food and service were great, would definitely recommend this place!",

You usually can't go wrong with Wolfgang Puck, so after looking at the menus online, I chose this place. I had seen it before on previous trips but had never dined there.  Busboy service was impeccable - my water glass was rarely empty, and the one time it was empty for a few minutes, the busboy came over and actually apologized which was over and above. Wait staff was friendly as well.  I ordered the tomato caprese appetizer, the grilled pork for my main, and tiramisu for dessert. Everything was fantastic although the tiramisu had more of a cheesecake-type quality; it could've used a little bit more coffee flavor and this is coming from someone who doesn't drink coffee.  My friend had a different appetizers, ravioli, and the pistachio pudding for dessert. She loved the pudding but said that you had to really like pistachio in order to like it.  Glad to know that there are other great Wolfgang Puck restaurants on the Strip, I've only been to Spago and maybe one other. Spago is one of my favorite Vegas restaurants but I'm adding Cucina to that list now too.",

We had a large group of eight and they were able to accommodate with no issues.   Really enjoyed the pastas. They were very flavourful and delicious. Two people got pizzas and didn't enjoy them as much. They were a bit dry and had very light toppings.   The sangria pitchers are delicious. My meal came out a bit later than my friends and our server brought out a wonderful selection of desserts because he felt bad.  Overall, service was excellent and the pastas are delicious.

We were greeted when we walked in and seated.  Sadly, our server never once came to our table.  I can't remember his name, but he was nowhere to be found.  If it wasn't for the server assistant who provided excellent customer service, we would have left.  In fact, when we were finished our lunch, we asked to speak to the manager.

We used BOGO coupons from MyVEGAS, with no trouble at all. The meal was an outstanding value given the cost, ingredients, and location. I highly recommend it!  The only suggestion we had for the restaurant is that it would be nice to get some bread with the meal.

I was here for a young professionals mixer. As soon as we got to the restaurant, pizza, bruschetta, mozarella balls and many  of their appetizers and hors doeuvres were presented to us immediately.  The waiters circulated the little balcony area so quickly and efficiently. It seemed as if food was coming out in all sorts of directions. It was definitely the speed they needed for an after work function.  Noticing the decor, the restaurant was vibrant in colors but also warm and comfortable. There was a sitting area, a bar and of course a little area for the cocktail tables.  We got our drinks which was brought to us immediately. The bartenders were friendly and receptive to questions. Just when we thought they had stopped serving food, they brought out another selection of appetizers. Off to the side was also a cheese-board and cold meats charcuterie.   Cucina provided a magnificent location with outstanding food service, professional and friendly staff and the perfect vibe. I would recommend this restaurant for your future event!",

    "text": "This restaurant is very chic, modern, and has a \"happy hour\" friendly environment. I had high expectations for this restaurant especially cause it's by Wolfgang Puck, and although some aspects of it did fulfill my expectations, others did not. The service was great and I had a great time, but the food itself was not spectacular. The price of the restaurant led me to believe that the food would be extraordinary, but it was honestly just mediocre. It was good, but nothing more than that. Another downside was the portion of the food; definitely did not feel like I was getting my money's worth with this place.  I will recommend this restaurant to whomever wishes for an elegant happy hour night out, but if you're wanting a fulfilling and satisfying meal, this is not the place for you. It was a good one time experience for my visit to Vegas because of the popular name, but I definitely will not be returning during my yearly trips to Vegas.",

I substituted the sausage for shrimp. We had Sherylynn as our server and she was FANTASTIC!! She is non stop working the bar and answering all questions and even gave us great suggestions on what to order. My husband had the boar w pasta and he enjoyed every bite thanks to Sherylynn's suggestion... overall amazingly delicious!!! Thanks Yelp for the suggestion!!",

He is allergic to seafood! The waitress was apologetic but when he asked to have a pizza instead she acted annoyed. Then the manager came over and apologized profusely but the pizza took another 20 minutes to come to the table. We ordered a second  $105 dollar bottle of wine to kill the time. Then the check came and I was shocked- they didn't even comp the pizza or anything. Disappointed that he wasn't able to enjoy a meal with us and then the attitude over their error was disappointing. I expected way more from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. We frequent Vegas often but I won't be spending anymore of our money here.",

    "text": "HUGE TURN OFF when your waiter asks how your meal is, and you inform him that your steak is tough & seems overcooked...  AND HE RESPONDS WITH, \"Guess it wasn't that bad, you're still eating it.\"  Uuhhhmm, okay?!  Thanks for making my Bday so memorable, I guess.   +++Too bad he had nooo ideaaa of the previous restaurant ordeal & how I didn't get to eat at all so I was STARVING out of my mind!!  I DO NOT send food back to be re-fired or re-made; I send it back to stay, period.  Hence my tummy situation when we got here for an early dinner.  Our lunch experience elsewhere was such that the kitchen failed to remove the melted Swiss cheese from my dish despite my clear request & our server's acknowledgement that the ticket stated this... meaning the kitchen simply made a mistake.  It happens.  But I can't do Swiss cheese!  So even though I was hungry, I literally could not eat it.  It was sent back & I sampled my friends' dishes to hold me over.+++  Having been to Ramsay's restaurants, Nobu, & others of culinary genius, we came to (Puck's) Cucina with high expectations.  Ordered the calamari & a pizza for appetizers.  Both were yummy.  Real talk, I'd come back for that pizza!    I ordered the ribeye special cooked medium-rare.  Now I don't know what was wrong with this steak, but ribeye is my cut & I make a mean cast iron seared, oven broiled ribeye at home.  ***This was theee absolute toughest, chewiest, bubble-gummiest, spit-out-several-bites-because-I-was-tired-of-chewing-est, most bland ribeye I've ever had!!***  Like, beyond being overcooked, the texture was such that I THINK THEY RAN OUT OF THE RIBEYE SPECIAL & tried to pass off a cheap chuck steak, bottom sirloin, or other lower quality cut.  It was sooo tough, but looked only slightly overcooked.  I didn't understand at all.  But I was so hungry by this point, I just enjoyed my side veggie & ate what I could of the horrible steak as opposed to sending it back to stay.    I had to ask the waiter's assistant for salt because our server went MIA for a bit after bringing our food.  Others in our group also needed salt...  namely, the salmon entree and the pasta dish, both of which I tasted.  The chicken parm was tasty as-is.    Later when our server came over to ask about the need for salt & how our meal was tasting...  I was honest.  Mine was a bit bland, very tough, and appeared overcooked.  Funny that even the waiter commented, \"Maybe you just happened to get that one weird ribeye.\"  Yeah, I bet.  Then he added, \" Guess it wasn't that bad, you're still eating it.\"  I didn't even bother explaining to him that (1) I have a rule about sending food back to be re-made... (2) how I was pretty hungry from my earlier fiasco... (3) we were in town celebrating my BDAY!...  since he clearly wouldn't have cared anyway.  He did end up bringing a complimentary dessert item for my troubles.   Given his \"I really don't care about you\" attitude, I wish I had sent it back & gone hungry a little longer so as not to pad his personal bottom line (tip)--  the ribeye special was $55.    I would only come here for appetizers & drinks... and even then, they would need to address the terrible service/ attitude I received.",

We tried the piccolo cheese board, rigatoni, sausage pizza (with an egg! You're a baby if you're not into egg on pizza!), and the rib eye special. Highly recommend. We loved everything and the California Cabernet we enjoyed with the meal. Tony guided us in our menu picks and was spot on. He also comped us the most delish dessert ever - fresh hot zeppolis! We are from NY and consider ourselves zep connoisseurs. These were fantastic.  Also loved the bus waiter. Such a gentleman. 20% off if you check in on yelp.

However, the low star rating only reflects the food. The linguine was a bit flavorless and the pasta had a texture similar to whole wheat pasta, so I didn't really enjoy that. The chicken was nice and tender and flavorful. We also got the appetizer mussels and bruchetta. Mussels was in a red sauce that I wasn't too fond of and they only have two small slices of bread to dip the sauce in. The bruchetta had a great flavor but I didn't like how the bread was so thin, the sauce ws quick to soak up the bread and sog it up. Prices here are pretty decent compared to other Vegas places, but it's not some place I'd crave for.",

It doesn't even seem like it should be in Las Vegas because it is quiet and sterile looking.  Crystals has a great selection of high-end stores.  That being said, one gets the idea that nobody ever shops in them.  And as you look out over the mall from Cucina, you might catch yourself feeling a bit somber.

I ordered the rigatoni, a friend ordered the salmon, and another friend ordered the NY strip steak. We were all satisfied with our dish. My pasta dish definitely hit the spot and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The bolognese sauce wasn't too salty or underseasoned. It was perfect for me.   My friend who ordered her salmon cooked medium really enjoyed it and said it wasn't too dry or over/under seasoned. My other friend ordered the NY strip steak rare and enjoyed it. We were all very pleased with what we ordered and what was really nice is that the portions are perfect. It wasn't too small or too big - just enough to feel satiated. I will definitely come back again when I'm in Las Vegas!",

Since I was still hungry I then ordered a sausage pizza And we split a pitcher of Hoegarden beer. The place was packed and seemed busy but our experience was a good one. Even though our bartender was busy she took care of us and made sure we had all we needed. I don't normally leave messages on help but we both felt that she went beyond the norm and I'd suggest to all of my friends to visit her and the restaurant.

We started with the calamari, which was probably the best calamari I have ever had. The pieces of squid were in nice large chunks, and the batter was a golden brown, perfectly deep fried. The garlic aioli accompanying the calamari was delicious but there wasn't enough.  Three of us ordered pizzas while the fourth person ordered gnocchi. The gnocchi was soft and chewy, and was tossed in a thick red sauce. The pizzas were not as delicious as the calamari, which I had thought was going to be a prelude to an awesome meal. The dough was very thin throughout the pie; probably the thinnest pizza I have ever eaten. I had the yukon gold potato pizza, but the potatoes were sliced so thin that I couldn't even taste them. (Upon eating the leftovers the next day, the potatoes even seemed undercooked as they tasted a bit raw). The dough also had a very floury taste to it.  The service was quick and friendly. Our water glasses were kept filled all throughout our meal.  Overall, the pizzas were meh, but the rest of the food was good, and prices are reasonable. I would come back, I just wouldn't order a pizza.",

Plant your bootay at the bar and gobble up some deliciously priced pizzas, salads, appetizers and booze. ($5 Hoegaarden on tap!)  There is more than enough for a meal on the menu. We had two individual size pizzas, a salad, calamari and a glass of beer for around $30, and the only thing that slightly disappointed was the insalata mista. The dressing was pretty much oil without zing, but the greens were fresh and beautiful. The pizza dough was thin and soft. We had the veggie selection, and it did not have sauce, which my husband missed, but I didn't mind. I still thought the pizza was flavorful with Ricotta cheese. The calamari was tender and came with bonus fried shrimp and little veggies. The batter flavor was spiced nicely. An amazing value for on the Strip, especially at Crystals!  We came in about 30-minutes before closing, and we experienced no attitude. Arriving close to closing time is always a good test of service, as bad servers will glare at you or try to convince you the kitchen is closed. The bartender, who was our server, was friendly and not pushy even after the place had officially closed.  If you happen to have blown all your cash at Miu Miu or Fendi or Kiki or... wherever, sidle up to the bar and enjoy quality happy hour treats!",

We ended up with a $100 giftcard to the whole CRYSTALS shopping center, which was pretty much dead when we came to the Vdara hotel for a couple of weekdays. Maybe they thought I'd buy a $3000 watch if they gave me $100, but of course that's a bunch of bullcrap so I was going to get a meal or two out of that $100. This is one of the only places in the complex for a regular lunch, so there we went.   I had high hopes since we went to Spago (didn't mean to go to multiple Wolfgang Puck restaurants) the previous night and loved it. However, for the price the food here was weak and forgettable.   I got veal ravioli with mushrooms. Lots of mushrooms. The weird fungi looking kind that don't really taste like anything. This was pretty much the focal point of the dish, because nothing else really stood out. The sauce was pretty bland and the veal didn't taste like much of anything. The portion was good but for $20+ I was really glad I had a gift card. Don't get me wrong, for $10 per plate I still would have thought it was weak, but for about $70 total after tip I was just mad out of principle.   Scampi appetizer was also kind of weak. Just lots of butter.   Just kind of a weird experience. Supposedly in this really upscale complex being served expensive food but it tasted more like something from a chain.  Lots of tourists at the other tables (sometimes not knowing what or how to order, being foreign tourists..) because there's just nowhere else to eat. What a weird scene!   Also service was slow. We got there right when it was opening at 11, so we could use up our giftcard before driving back to Fresno. And this would hold us over til we got home too. But the slow service was whack. We were one of the first people in and people who showed up much later than us were eating before we got our dishes. Lame!",

Who would think, in the Crystals mall - the best mall food I've had. It wasn't crowded and great for groups. All our food came out together, and the staff keep our glasses filled.",

The first time I went was a few hours before my flight and ordered salad and pizza with a diet coke and everything seemed to be fine.  The second time I went was for lunch one day with two of mis amigos. We ordered a handful of items, and followed lunch with an expensive bottle of wine and a cheese plate.  The glasses were extremely dirty (all three, one had dried food pieces on it) and the server proceeded to pour what amounted to be $20 worth of wine into one of the glasses before we noticed the dried food piece mid-pour. We were in Vegas so we really didn't mind. The cheese-plate took about 30 minutes after they gave us the first bottle which was almost finished, and was more of an American-sized cheese-plate (huge pieces of cheese). I would still recommend checking it out.",

And considering that this place boasts the name of wolfgang puck and its surrounded by shops that sell shoes and hand bags for no less then 3000 dollars.  You might think its expensive but its not.   We got a pitcher of some wonderful pale in a nice round bottom pitcher.  An order of the fried calamari which was fantastic. and the proccuito pizza which was also very good but on the salty side.  the bill came out to around 50 dollars.",

Toppings are typical of pretty much any pizza place in any major city, and the crust is totally soggy in the middle of the pizza, but scorched on the outside.  Totally unimpressed.  At $18 for my pizza i could have gotten one just as good from Dominoes for 8 bucks.  I also got the Ricotta fritters with red pepper jelly to start.  They were not very good.  The Jelly was not spicy at all, but instead incredibly sweet paired with the extremely sour lemon ricotta fritters, my palette was totally shot after eating just one of them.  Why would a well known chef put his name on this crap?  Give me some interesting pizza not the same old fair I get everywhere else!",

    "text": "I frequent a lot of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants both in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas. However, I have never been so disappointed in the service at a restaurant before. I came here over a year ago and I am still so mad about the service that I finally decided to Yelp about it.   My friends and I wanted to watch the Patriots Texans game but most of the restaurants in the City Center area were packed. So, we decided to eat here. There were 8 of us (5 girls and 3 guys) and the restaurant seated us at a table with no access to televisions. So, we asked to be moved. They had a high table that sat five with a view of the TV and some seats at the bar, so the boys and the girls split up. We asked that the high table next to ours be held for the boys when it  became available so that at some point in the meal, we could all be sitting together.  We ordered and soon the people at the table next to us left, so we went to tell the boys to come over. However, before we were able to do so, the red-haired lady who we were dealing with sat another group at the table. We pointed out that we had saved this for our friends, and she just said it was too late now because she sat other people there. Our master plan had been foiled, but we gave up at this point and decided to continue dining separately.  At one point in the meal, our waiter overheard my girlfriends and I discussing how we were disappointed and we would have probably eaten elsewhere had we known we would have had to sit separately anyway. He asked if everything was okay, and we told him that he had been great, but the others at the restaurant were not. The red-haired hostess/manager came over to us and said \"I heard you are talking badly about me. Do you have a problem with me?\" My friends and I were shocked. We didn't realize we were in high school again, dealing with this type of gossip and confrontation. We told her that yes, we were disappointed in her service. She did not do anything to make it up to us, and had a major attitude with us for the rest of the meal.   Totally disappointed in my experience here.",

The duck confit pizza was delicious, but the brussel sprouts are to-die-for! I normally don't like brussel sprouts, but my sister loves them, and the waiter was sold on them, so I thought I'd open my mind a little and give them a try. They blew my mind away! This is one dish that shouldn't just stay in Vegas!!!  The risotto special was just okay - I don't even remember it much - that's how memorable it was.  Moral of the story: TRY THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS!",

All three were solid dishes-- the octopus was grilled nicely and packed a good punch with acidity and flavor, the prosciutto pizza had a good chewy crust and flavor, and the veal was tender and the ravioli itself had a good bite. The veal was definitely the highlight. We also got a fruity rum cocktail that was pretty good too.  If you are around the Crystals, a good option. Otherwise I wouldn't make this a destination stop.",

    "text": "We came to Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina for a small meal before hitting the strip, it was 9 PM on a Friday night. We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. Dave came shortly after we were seated and brought water and took our drink order. He recommended the Joseph James Wiseguy heiferweisner (?), a local beer which was really good! We ordered the starter prosciutto and the sausage pizza.   The prosciutto was so, soo good. It came quickly, the bread was warm and the mozzarella was cold. The dish had just a little salt, which really made the mozzarella delicious. The servers were quick to take our used plates and utensils. The pizza was really good, the pickled peppers were just spicy enough. It was medium sized pizza, but thin crust. Splitting it was a good small snack for 2, or a whole meal if you were hungry.   The vibe was casual, and it was right in the middle of the mall so if you were seated at the edge you could look out at the rest of the shops. It was pretty calm when we went, but if it were a busy day the restaurant would've probably been pretty loud with all the ambient mall noises.   Only gripe: the bathroom needed attention. It was nice, but the mirror was dirty and there was no soap. Other than that, it was pretty cool!",

We had a reservation and were seated quickly, but things went downhill from there.  Once we ordered the food took an absurdly long time to come out, so long that various waiters/waitresses came to reassure us that our food was coming and to apologize for the wait.  We said it was okay, but we were all actually starving and getting impatient.  Once the food finally came, it was delicious, and we forgot about how long it had taken to get there.  Because of the time it had taken to get our orders out, they brought us two free desserts (a cookie plate, and fresh cream filled donuts).  Both were delicious (especially the donuts), but also took forever to arrive!  I believe we ended up in the restaurant for somewhere around 2 hours between all of the waiting.  I was surprised at the lack of service this restaurant had, but very impressed with all of the food.",

Kids menu made it actually quite affordable with kids.   Pizzas were great. The mushroom Za with egg on top sounds strange but tastes good. The thin sliced cheese and cured meat apps were excellent. Service was excellent and they helped us figure out an issue we had with our show tickets while we ate, definitely above and beyond the call of duty.   Verdict-highly recommend!",

    "text": "My wife and I stayed three nights in Vegas, and this was hands-down our best dining experience, both in terms of food quality and service quality.   Food: We had lamb ravioli (a special) and a chicken caesar salad (which was well above par for a caesar salad) and shared both the gelato and tiramisu desserts. All of the food was excellent. Portion sizes are a bit small for the price, but more than made up for in terms of quality and flavor! In fact, this was the only meal we had in Vegas that we thought was worth what we paid for it. Moreover, this was the perfect place for dinner just before heading into the ARIA to catch Cirque du Soleil's \"Zarkana;\" it also allowed us to avoid the restaurants within the ARIA itself.   Service: Our server was extremely knowledgeable and was able to describe each dish's preparation in great detail - it was actually very impressive. He was polite and prompt, and he and the other service staff kept our beverages consistently topped up.   Ambience: It's sort of in an exposed position in a mall, which you might think wouldn't lend itself well to an intimate dinner, but we were very happy with it. We had a table for two at the edge of the restaurant overlooking the lower level of Crystals. Noise levels were low (because who can afford to shop at Crystals? There's no one in there but store clerks!) and we were able to have a quiet, enjoyable dinner.  Overall, we had a great time and were very, very happy with Cucina - it's what I expected from the Wolfgang Puck brand.",

The bread and spreads that come with it was an unexpected delight.  I got the French Onion soup and a salad with goat cheese.  The soup was the best French Onion I have ever had and I have tasted a ton.  I literally order it at every restaurant I go to and this one tops them all with ease.  I do not remember the name of the salad but it was incredible.  It even had onions on it (which I normally hate) but in this instance they were balanced so well I didn't even notice them at first.    My friends had the Carbonara and a burger which they were both very happy with.  Though out the meal we all kept exclaiming how amazing every thing was.  The drink menu as spectacular as well.  I have recently got into St Germain's liquor and Brassiere Puck had a few mixed drinks with it (very excited!).  The one I had was called something that involved numbers.  It was delicious! Whenever I have friends in town we always stop in here for lunch.  Also they are giving locals 20% off food for the rest of the summer!",

My large group of friends and I dropped with no warning on this restaurant, and they exceeded every expectation.  the service was quick, attentive, and superbly friendly.  The food was ordered family style, 7 pizzas, 2 salads, 4 entrees, and 4 appetizers.  It came out in amazing time, was well executed in presentation and timing, and honestly the best meal I have had in at least a year.  Calamari was very good. The grilled octopus salad was perfectly cooked and just the right texture, the salmon was sushi grade and cooked just as we ordered it, rare. Most other restaurants overcook fish, but they seared a 1/4 inch thick layer of carmelization, and the rest was perfectly uncooked. I complimented the manager and staff on the way out, and they deserved it- our experience should have been botched, but was handled by True professionals.",

The water was always filled, the manager checked in & they always showed up right when we needed them. No hovering or over-checking in.  I had gotten a $100 gift card from Bellagio for different shops in the Crystal Shops (I much prefer the outlets on the way out)......the only food/drink options were here & Starbucks....If it weren't for the gift card I probably would have never stopped here  I took 3 friends...together we got 4 different mixed drinks (cranberry margarita, moscow mule, lemon drop & a beer) everything was cold & strong.   We got the sausage appetizer, ravioli, carbonara, a margarita pizza & soup. The soup and ravioli portion was kinda small, but the raviolis were stuffed. Half of the pizza & carbonara went back to the room with us.  All the food came out quick, it was hot & everything tasted good.
