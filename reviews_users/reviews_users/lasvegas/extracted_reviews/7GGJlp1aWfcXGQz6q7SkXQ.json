    "text": "Do not waste your time or money. Seven of us girls on a trip celebrating a birthday this past weekend came across this lunch spot which wasn't overly busy. We sat down and it took sometime for our waitress to come by. When she did, she took our drink and food order immediately. Drinks took about 20 or so minutes to get (mind you, only 3 of us ordered alcohol, the rest soda or water) and says our food should be coming out momentarily. The next 30+ minutes, still no food and waitress no where to be found. Our food finally comes out and every burger (not just the bun...the beef patties as well), every order of fries/onion rings was cold and limp to the touch and the grilled chicken salad was cold, limp and soggy. The server who brought out our food was friendly and apologetic and was slightly irritated the waitress didn't even provide us with plates/utensils. Due to the long wait, hungry and worried what would happen if they returned their food decided to just eat it. Still no site of waitress, I went and found her and asked to cancel my order and told her about the outcome of our food. My order never got canceled, but reheated and re-served. She still never checked on us, but instead sent the manager who offered a very small discount on our food and a couple of fried Twinkies.   On a side note: I had ordered their most expensive signature \"Pig Mac\" for $15.50!!! that looked scrumptious and highlighted on their screens throughout the restaurant. It looked NOTHING like it. I picked around at it and it was bleak, flavorless and unappealing. Burger King's Whopper put this burger to shame.   Needless to say, the consensus was to leave 0 or a very small tip.",

I'm actually experiencing it right now and writing a play by play. We have been seated for 20 minutes and no help. I went to the bartender to order drinks and ask for menus, and I had to pull her away from the manager flirting with her and talking about her watch. I asked the bartender to flag us some service, and 15 minutes later and after watching the server text for several minutes, she magically appeared. This place is nice in theory. If I could give a zero I would.",

    "text": "I was very excited to find the rock house (formerly in front of imperial palace) had reopened in the Venetian.   I had great times here off the strip on former vacations, having visited multiple times, and was excited to are their newer location with updated seating and new tvs. The service was good (wait for it) and on a bachelor party with 5 guys we opted for the $50 per person open bar sold to is by our waitress. She was good about making clear what drinks were included and the ease of the whole situation made it appealing.  When our server changed about 1.5 hours in, we tipped her about $70 on our $250 tab anticipating a night of drinking.  As our new server came, we were informed we could no longer be served at our table (because she didn't sell them to us). We could go to the bar or and she's sorry but it isn't her policy, \"you can talk to my manager\".  Mind you this was at 630 with the bar generally empty.  We dealt with it and went to the bar only to learn we had been downgraded from the traditional pint, to a literal 12 oz solo cup filled with about 8 ozs of beer. See photo.  In addition, when we tried to order blue moon, which we had been drinking for the previous 1.5.hours, we were told that it is no longer included in the open bar bracelet.  Overall, it seems a lot like a con. And it's unfortunate that this put a damper on our trip and really made us unlikely to ever return to a bar I had previously thought highly of.  I sincerely recommend going somewhere else. It's a big city with great options. This is not one of them.",

When I'm buying drinks for 11 direct reports, I'd like them to be on the less expensive side :) Rockhouse typically has someone standing at the top of the escalator when you enter the Venetian, handing out coupons for buy 1- get 1 cocktails (the drinks are only about $7 to start with, so it's a pretty good deal- especially when you consider that just downstairs there's a bar with $19 vodka cranberries). You can also order pitchers of beer, and it's $4 for a beer pong set (balls and solo cups).   I will warn you, it's loud, and it's club-type music. Also, there's a bull, and some of the folks who get on it tend to be... well, not fun to watch.   Still, I like this place. It's the perfect place to start off the night and buy a few rounds, get everyone a little buzzed before heading over to one of the casino bars. And beerpong brings back those college memories :)",

We opted to have the sauce on the side and went with the bacon cheeseburger. Wings were meaty and juicy. The burger felt like it was ran through a grinder 100 times as it just merged with the soft bun and oozed into every bite. we sat at the bar because we like to hit and run and service with Bridget was great. Pretty decent stop.",

    "text": "Went here 4 days straight while in VEGAS!!  This place cracks me up though! The bartenders are cool enough! But the girls that work the doors are hilarious. To see girls using hula hoops to get people to come inside and check this spot out is just FUNNY! I do not recall a time when a hula hoop has made me want to go anywhere!!!!! But, I guess entertainment is what it is all about.   As far as service here, the drinks are good but overpriced which is to be expected in Vegas, especially at place on the strip!! But, the drinks are moderately strong so you get somewhat of a BANG for your buck. If you want to save get BEER if you want to get mixed drink expect to spend MORE!!!   The DJ and dance scene is fairly good. Didn't have to worry about sloppy drunks or stumbling on the dance floor which is a nice change compared to other places. Everyone seems either too drunk to dance or just lightly buzzed and rockin out on the floor.   Good times. Oh, there is a pool table that is modeled after a car here as well!! If you get a chance to play on it please do it! Just for the experience if not for anything else. The music is mostly modern hip hop so expect all the most recent tunes and hits to be played while busting some SWEET moves!  #breakitdown #bustamove #shotshotshotshotshotshot",

The staff was unsure of the actual beer specials however and this is what the manager on the street had lured us in with.  That was quite disappointing, expecting a reasonable $3 beer and then it actually being $6 can deter my patronage for sure!  We were in during a slow lunch hour and the food was quite slow to arrive and waitress was not very attentive.  There are for sure plenty of options on the strip, but I'd give them another shot when back in Vegas.",

The maitre d was surprised that we had a dinner booking. That was the first warning.  My colleague and I waited a long time for service. The waitstaff was swamped, so after 45 minutes, we flagged down a maitre d to take our order. They brought our drinks out soon after, but after we waited 30 minutes for our food, a real waitress came by to check if our food ever came (no).  Once the waitress found us, everything went fine, but in all, it took 90 minutes before got our food.  The burgers were thin and overcooked (we asked for medium).",

If you have to lie to your customers to make your money you shouldn't be a waitress and all that extra money we spent we had the most shit service plus she got our orders wrong and she couldn't even get our drinks right. I'm sorry but because if this dishonesty and bad service my friends and I will not be coming back and the people who read this should know how this place is being ran. I have to give 2 stars for the food and drinks that was excellent. It's too bad they could have got a five stars from me if it wasn't for the dishonesty, lousy service and poor customer service.",

The waitress came over and we ordered drinks.  Very friendly,  I ordered 3 tacos: shrimp, fish and chorizo. The chorizo taco was my favorite! Tacos are $1.50 or $2.00 each.  My husband ordered the chicken chiptole tacos and my husband really enjoyed them.  We had 7 tacos and 2 drinks.  Around $20- $25.  We were really happy with our food and drink choices.

I mean it's not a mega nightclub, but a fun place to drink and play beer pong and shuffle board. Also they have a giant rooster(cock) to ride instead of a bull so all the hot girls were on it lol hilarious stuff.

Ten minutes before game time and their check in process is so slow there's a line down the hallway 200 people long. We went to the desk and were repeatedly told they'd get everyone in on time but the line never moved. Minutes before kickoff we had to make a mad dash back to our rooms just to see the game. To make matters worse, when the crowd got impatient they pulled their staff inside and stuck security guards at the door because they couldn't handle the increasingly angry customers. Pathetic. Unprofessional. Unforgivable. We came into town just to see the Superbowl and had hundreds of other options, most of which were cheaper, but we passed because they reassured us they'd pull through. Steer clear of these amateurs.",

I was a little surprised to see this place in the Venetian on the list as it was kinda divey with a mechanical bull and sickly sweet drinks, but we had just come from Senor Frogs, so I shouldn't judge. As part of the crawl, we had gotten a free drink ticket. I was really happy to find that the drink that they made me, a vodka cranberry, was in no way lacking in alcohol. I was pretty happy with it. By this time in the crawl, my fiance and I had made friends with a giant family reunion party and we all had a great time sitting around and watch people get clobbered by the mechanical bull. Beware ladies! This bull (and its controller) are totally misogynistic and will do everything in their power to make things jiggle, bounce and ride up. Do NOT get on this thing in you are in a short dress, cause chances are that you'll be putting on a hell of a lot more of a show than you bargained for.",

After 5 minutes I decided to ask a bus boy who told me to seat myself. Menus were never offered but I was able to see the taco menu and decided I would just order those...if I ever got a server. Took about 10 minutes but I finally ordered. Tacos were good. Ordered a miller lite and my son ordered a Sierra Mist. I told the server about the 2 for 1 drink card I had and she had the nerve to try and comp my son's soda instead of giving me another beer!  who does that?

Drinks are well-made (thanks again, Ashley!) and the atmosphere is very casual. The overall feel is what the name sounds like, a Rock House!

The staff has been super friendly both times we've visited as well. It's also conveniently located. There's a lot of pizza and \"fru fru\" crap on the strip but sometimes you just want a burger from somewhere other than McDonald's. PS - currently lip syncing the hell out of Whitney Houston... scratch that - HEART just started playing... I'm gonna order more food.",

I thought what the heck let's see what beers they have on a tap. We went inside and yes they do have your regular Bud light/Budweiser crap but they do have Goose Island IPA, Strongbow, Dirty Dog IPA, so i thought wonderful. You buy one drink and they give you a second one on the house. Great idea and cool place. We ended up with Nile as our bartender and he was great.  You can also smoke cigars in the back bar if you want. We ended up here both nights and again Nile was our bartender. As soon as we walked up to the bar he greeted us, and immediately poured us Goose Island again. Nile changed the tv right away to a hockey game for us without no problem. This is a surprising find for the Venetian, cool spot, great beers, and a comfortable setting.",

(5 star review) you either work for the company, know someone there or one of the rare lucky few who was serviced.  I can guarantee 90% of those who attended were not happy of how the event was organized, but most won't waste their time writing a review.

Super strange vibe and only a few tables of guests when we walked in, otherwise it was so empty we thought it was closing. We decided to try it anyway and sat down at a table. We sat for 20 minutes without anyone looking our way to take drink orders as two servers stood at the bar giggling with the bartender. We finally caught the attention of one server to ask if we could order drinks. She scowled and shrugged and pointed at one of the servers who had been talking at the bar. I think this was a Cave Server grunt that meant \"that's your server\" and which point we all looked at each other and said \"that's our cue to flee.\" It turned out to be a lucky move because we had a great dinner elsewhere and apparently the food is terrible at Rockhouse anyway. Yay us! This place is lame.",

Was here with friends for a quick bite since we saw how unbelievably cheap the breakfast was advertised outside. Well, it definitely fits the saying \"you get what you pay for\". Honestly, I have never had such wretched food in my life!! Most of us had the \"classic\" breakfast. It was classically bad!!!! The eggs tasted like it came from a powder mix. The waitress said she was told the eggs were fresh. If the eggs were fresh, then they were cooked in the microwave until they exploded and turned to dust because that's how they tasted. The lemonade tasted like water, barely an ounce of lemon in it and we each asked for a side of bacon but only 3 of the 4 sides appeared because they ran out of bacon. Didn't mention to tell us that at all. Luckily, we weren't charged for the missing bacon but the drink costs as much as the awful meal. Sorry, I've had better breakfasts at Jack in the Box and as greasy as their food is, I would eat that first before going back to The Rockhouse. Fortunately, the Strip has so many more delicious restaurants to choose from. This isn't one of them.",

My only complaint is that no side dishes come with it. You only get 3 tacos, that is all.  Service - Our waitress was super friendly. It did take 20 min to get water but it wasn't that big of a deal.   They have cool items littered throughout the place. Things like a tricycle, a cage, a stripper pole. They also offer all-day, all-you-can-drink for $50. I'm pretty sure the items are for drunk fools to play with. I love it. Oh yeah they also have a mechanical chicken. Not bull chicken.",

Last time we went it was quiet, classic rock was mixed in with 90s pop and there was a mechanical bull.  This time we TRIED to go back and have a few drinks after dinner only to be told of a cover charge, and drink minimums. Going in to find friends I was greeted by rowdy college age kids playing beer pong and completely drowned put by EDM blaring over any attempt at conversation. .good thing for hand signals as we left within the space of 1 over DJ'D pop song.  Guess we will stick to the small bar area outside the main club rooms..  If you are over 30, arent dressed for a strip club and aren't into EDM .. go elsewhere",

You need water and food, suddenly ...you feel the undying urge to stop.DON'T DO IT......PLEASE LISTEN!!!!....DO NOT WALK....RUN out of this place! Do not let yourself suffer from the mirage that hungover shopping will cause! Had I not trucked through the shops at the Venetian dehydrated...I never would have stopped here. I made a mistake that I would regret for the rest of my time in Vegas. I still regret it.   Imagine your college boyfriend's fraternity house and combine it with your father's basement.  It's like eating at the gas station and from a cat litter box at the same time. It tries so hard. So hard that they have  full staff dedicated to luring people in to eat. This is not a dive. A dive has as an old shuffle board table and a pool table form the 70's. This is a corporate attempt to replicate an actual dive and it has failed miserably.   You suddenly hear a good Smashing Pumkpin's song and Rockhouse redeems itself. Then....Def Leopard blares and you think, \"It's too late..my order is in\".   When you realize that the nachos that the worst waitress ever (ex spirit airlines stewardess) shoves down your throat are designed for a stomach pump in a Las Vegas hotel bathroom...it is too late. Your friends then kindly move them to the next table.... but as you lift your head from the trough of hell....the 18 flat screens surrounding you each picture these \"nachos\". \"Nachos\"? It is like comparing a Taco to Antifreeze. These \"nachos\" landed me in an infirmary. Ask the USO. My friend's and I actually gauge the nastiness of conditions on a scale of Rockhouse(worst) to Hoarders Season 3 episode 2 (lesser evil).  Moral of the story: Drink water people. Do not let Satan's mirage locker swallow you whole. This place actually represents the bowels of Satan in Haiti. It was absolutely, positively the worst culinary experience of my life.",

This was the case for each drink I had. Suppose I shouldn't have tipped her in advance for them.   The food was pretty good, there are a ton of games such as beer pong, pool, shuffleboard etc, and the music and atmosphere are decent.",

Apparently during half times of games and various breaks in the sporting world, extremely obnoxious, attention seeking girls (not women because most of them look VERY young) get on a mechanical bull, touch each other and themselves provocatively and blow a whistle over and over again.    Now on to the positives... This bar isn't expensive ($25 for a bucket of 5 beers) and the wings (bone in) are quite good.  There are a good amount of TV's and you can pretty much pick which room you want to be in.  They have bar games like shuffleboard and flippy cup that looked like fun.  Whether you're freaking out about your Fantasy Football Team or just an NFL fan who enjoys watching the games, this is a good fit for you.  If they could eliminate the obnoxiousness of the females who work there, it would cater to more people that want to actually watch games and enjoy bar food without the stupid whistles piercing their ear drums.",

My boyfriend got the pig mac burger with fries and I got grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. He said his burger was ok. He ate it at least. My chicken was completely inedible. It was either raw or just complete rubber. I've never been more disgusted with a restaurant food in my life. We tried to finish up quickly and get out. We paid $40 for complete garbage.

Staff is ummm....unhelpful.  So I venture out into the world of all the Venetian has to offer....and it is lines and lines of hangry men.  All the way past B&B Burger To Go(which I dearly wanted to try).....so I go past Bouchon Bakery cart up to Rockhouse and....no lines(should have known)  The very cool and very curvy hostess takes me to a nice table in the bar, and I get to spread out all my shit and relax for a minute.....relaxation comes at a cost my friends.....$11.00 for a standard Captain n' Coke.  That's right....ELEVEN DOLLARS!  That is more than they charge at the airport.  These were not tall drinks either, served in a rocks glass.  Beware.  They do have a $50.00 all-you-can drink special, but I was not in that frame of mind...was at this show for business.  Anyway, had the Tijuana Mini Hot Dogs to eat($12.95 for 3) and they were super-duper, yes they were!!!!-quite a bit larger than a Smokey Link , bacon wrapped and fried on a teeny, but tasty bun with avo, pico de gallo(fresh!), grilled jalapeno, pineapple and a ribbon of sour cream.  Damn this was a welcome surprise!!!!  Sadly, the Jalapeno Poppers($8.95 for 6) were not.  Average at best.  Here's the thing.  They charge $7.95 for an order of waffle cut fries, which I dearly wanted with my hot dogs, but will not do a half order, and there was no way I was gonna do a full....so I got the poppers as a greasy, crunchy foil to the quite elevated taste of the TJ hot dogs.  They were ok.  I left two on the plate.  Break it down-  Ambiance/Cleanliness---Fake corporate dive bar on the Strip.  Cleanliness was \"ok\", but just. Decent bathrooms, paper towel dispenser was out. Tables were sticky....3 stars.  Service-\"ok\" but just.  Server was sorta chunky in Daisy Dukes and not very helpful/surly.  I think I saw fire shoot out of her nostrils when I asked about a 1/2 order of fries.  Can't get the image out of my brain. 2 stars.  Food-see above.....2 stars....bill was like $50.00.....was expecting about $25.00-$30.00.  Never going back for lunch.",

Their manager Danielle is as good as it gets (I am biased, she is a Yankee fan). She was welcoming and warm and went above and beyond yesterday for myself and my guests (one day I will be stealing her from you lol). The bartender Steve and his barback Dan, as good as it gets. They were attentive, gregarious and sincere and worked a very busy bar like dogs. The food was good and the atmosphere was great. As a local and bar owner? I strongly recommend Rockhouse. Great times. Thank you people...  Stephan Galdau OWL",

    "text": "One word - unexpected. On the surface a place that tags itself as an \"ultra-dive bar\" with a hot dog and taco menu, a mechanical bull, beer pong and a pool table has little appeal to me.  But it's also in the Venetian which usually means a snooty bartender will take 9 minutes to make a 13 ingredient, $21 martini. Expensive \"celebrity\" chef snoots-ville is a Venetian specialty.  However this down to earth little gem is in the Venetian and nothing is infused, crushed or foamed and that suits me just fine.      It was really fun, the music was great, the food was scrumptious and because it is in the Venetian I didn't have to get a hep-c vaccine or up my hobo-stab insurance to brave some sketchy parking lot to get there.          Food wise what I would expect from a bar is some crappy frozen, reheated garbage on a plastic plate.  It was on a plastic plate but it was fricking delicious.  Under protest I tried the mini chili cheese hotdogs.  Chili and cheese usually gives me heartburn and because I don't really like chili cheese hotdogs it's not worth it so I avoid them.  But I tried these and they were so good I went back a couple days later and ordered them again, this time armed with a handful of Tums to maximize enjoyment.  And they have soft-serve ice-cream - yum.     What was also unexpected is that admittedly on the surface I appear to be a \"corporate type\" and I thought this place would be full of \"dirt-bag types.\"  It wasn't.  The crowd ranges the socioeconomic spectrum which makes for a great atmosphere.  There were a few more English dudes there than I would have liked, but I also think there was some weird convention that week.      There are a couple of things to be aware of.  There was prolific use of a smoke machine by the DJ - a little The Beach circa 1999.  If you have a couple drinks and then become tempted to get on the mechanical bull, think twice.  I saw a couple of ladies scamper on that thing and it was not hot.  More like awkward dry-humping.  But in those ladies defenses they did appear to think they looked pretty sexy.  Also some of the cocktail waitresses' outfits were not the most becoming (i.e. pudgy stripper).  Maybe someone should have an uncomfortable conversation with a couple of them, but I was told by my male companions they were all hot and I was crazy.   Highly recommend.",

We didn't end up using it but we DID have $5 jager bombs and bought a $20 pitcher and played beer pong. BEER PONG! I realize now that the amount of germs we probably consumed by playing BP in a bar was probably ridiculous, but clearly we didn't care. The bartenders were really chill and they have an electric bull! LADIES! Please, if you are wearing a dress..not the best time to jump on that thing.  If you are not into a place with a strict dress code and a chill environment (I say this because we were in formal dresses/toms/flip flops and track pants), check this place out.",

You can pay $50 for open bar all day. They also have buy 1 get 1 happy hour well drinks. Mechanical bull is free to ride  for women and $5 for guys.

    "text": "As we neared the Wynn hotel, cards for the Rockhouse were coming at us like bees to honey. Feeling a tad hungry we decided to give it a whirl and I am glad we did. Far from a dive bar, you could consider The Rockhouse a laid back and unpretentious bar environment.   The cards I mentioned before, were intended specfically to promote drink specials which I could not completely wrap my mind around after a being over-served Bloody Mary's at the sports book.  The Rock Me Like a Hurricane was a double Bacardi and Amaretto drink which was over priced at $12.00 even with the free draft beer, which was the hook of the cards. But I can not complain as our server Marisa was up to the task of great recommendations and a freebie after we ordered another round. The Buffalo Smokin' Hot Wings were fairly priced at $11.95 for ten very plump and fresh wings and tasted as though they were pre-grilled then deep-fried prior to the sauce being added. Although I believe my exact quote was \"Gimme your hottest wing and make 'em hurt\" I was not suffering any heat pains which oddly is a feeling I enjoy. The Steak and Pickle Taco's oozed grease and the pickles were not the vegetable I would have complimented the very nice pieces of carne asada steak bits. The chef came out personally to deliver my wings with a smile that could illuminate the Mines of Moria (Lord of the Rings reference). and went back in the kitchen to get me an additional side of blue cheese at no additional charge. If the same request was given to a chef in my area, you had better duck and quick as a frying pan could be heading your way via airmail.",

We had a girl named Christine. Normally, I'd expect attractive waitresses at such a place (which Christine is not; she didn't even wear the uniform every other girl working did, but looked dumpy like she had been up for weeks and wore a hoody) - but it doesn't matter as long as they are friendly and good at their job. Christine is definitely neither!  Let's see:  - Unfriendly (gave off that 'I hate my job, why am I here' vibe  - Asked her 5+ times to see if they could put on a specific hockey game (with 80 TVs and it being early/empty, this shouldn't be a problem; but every time I asked her she looked like it was a brand new request and forgot). Never got to see the game.  - Was super slow to take our order, deliver the drinks and never brought water my friend asked for repeatedly.  - Asked her if the drinking games offered/promoted were every night or only certain nights; she didn't know and apparently couldn't find out (because she obviously never bothered asking anyone)  - Grabbed a plate of food I was still eating and took it away while I stared at her in shock/laughing. She didn't ask if I was done and it was pretty obvious I was still eating it when she just swiped the plate.  - Took over 30 minutes when asked to bring the bill; never brought it. We had to get another waitress to help us. Then our bill was completely wrong, over-charged for happy hour drinks, etc... and it took her another 15+ minutes standing at the register trying to figure out how to correct it.  On top of everything else, we tried a sampling of various food (fried pickles, sliders, tacos and boneless buffalo wings) and the food was very bland and sub-par for bar food.  For a place I *should* love hanging out at, this place failed miserably. I might return is I could receive a guarantee Christine wasn't working and we'd have a different server...",

    "text": "After Yelping for an upcoming Vegas trip I came across this bar and it seemed like everything I am about and everything I love back home. I was right. This place did not let me down.. it did take some finding as it is inside the Venetian Hotel. This place is divey but not intimidating. The bartenders were all awesome and there was a nice mixed crowd both times I came. Drinks  and shots are a bit pricey but it's Vegas after all and the atmosphere made the price worth it. The food seemed like standard bar food but that can be just what you need after a few drinks. The drinks were delicious and strong what more could you ask for? Best of all? A $50 option to drink all day, come and go as you please!",

But like most places in Vegas, $6 for a Bud Light feels strange and un-American, so come in knowing that you are gonna drop cash on drinks and you'll be fine.  Tried a fish taco, a chorizo, the chipotle chicken and the steak/blue cheese taco.  Chirizo and chipotle were better than the other two, but nothing was a home run here.  I'm not sure I would go back unless it's Tuesday!",

    "text": "Nice little spot in the Venetian hotel. It is located at the 2nd floor next to the Grand Canal Shoppes. I wouldn't say it's a nice place to relax after a hectic day of shopping because it does get crowded during games.  Honestly, the food is great but it's nothing special. It's not like buffalo wild wings or hooters. The only great thing about it is that you may customize your food however you please! I was disappointed about their buffalo wings because 75% was skin/breading 25% meat. You're better off making your own taco or hotdog than the wings. I liked their chicken chipotle slider with bacon. Omfg. Idk the spiciness is just right for me.  The pros outweigh the cons of this restaurant in my opinion... Pros: - The waitresses really take care of you and they're hospitable! - Have you seen the 88oz guitar drink container?! It's badass, get your mixed drink in there and walk around the strip feeling like a rockstar. - Entertainment; there are various games to play which include: table hockey, pool, foosball, and not to mention the mechanical bull ride. You can never have too much of a laugh when drunk chicks just try and dominate the thing.  Cons: - Kind of a small place so it get's pretty crowded - Be careful of where you sit because there are certain spots in the air conditioning vents where there's water droplets - The wings... Ehhh, I'll give it a C-",

It was kind of cool that it felt like anyone was welcome but I don't know who they are targeting.  There is a mechanical bull for the cowboys/cowgirls, stripper poles for the ladies, beer pong for the frat boys, punk rock serves, and hip-hop music. There was just a lot of different things going on, but that did make it a little more fun as I just sat back and watched the show.  The drinks were a little less expensive then the average bar/night club, and they do offer some good deals. There are also a tone of TV's and of course each one is playing something different.  This is a coin toss...go there or don't but if you do, they will have something you enjoy and something you wont.",

Don't be fooled by their 15% discount, it was a waste of time, might as well have paid full price instead of being lied to. We sat down and then half an hour went by before we got our drink order in. We then ordered and sat for an hour and a half bordering on two hours before leaving because they didn't have our food ready. It's hot dogs and salads. What are they doing, growing lettuce and feeding livestock for meat?!  The manager came and pretty much just said we can leave after we express how unhappy we were. Looking around before leaving, we realized the groups that came in around the same time as us were just as unhappy with the treatment. Empty drinks everywhere and no food to be seen.",

It could've folded here but I think that they found a vibe that works.  Pros- $50 all you can drink is worth it. Start here at 11, drink a bunch, go away and nap and come back later in the evening.  Their drink specials are good, and the specialty cocktails tasty.  Food aint bad either.  Waitresses and bartenders are mostly friendly.  Men's room has an icon of a rooster on it, I don't wanna know what is on the ladies...  Cons- The ridiculous pool table.  Nothing else around here is like this. None of the shops, restaurants, or attractions are remotely low-class.   Beer pong tables cross the dart boards -- how does that work?  Overall a good waste of an hour or so and a great place to hang while the ladies shop/gamble. (Is there a financial difference between the two?)",

First off we went through a few people till we got an actual server. She informed us that she was training which is fine. The other person training her was not personable at all.   Once they took our order they still came back multiple times to ask questions and it wasn't even the trainee who took the order. It took at least 45 minutes till our food came. We had multiple orders of cold fries which they replaced by request. Burgers looked like they had been sitting a while.  Chicken sandwich was bland with just lettuce and some slices of pickles.   After we finished and received our tab, multiple people in our party mentioned the wait and nothing. No apology no discount nothing. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for quality food. Not something I would come to a restaurant and pay for.",

    "text": "So let's start with if your on the strip and want something fairly priced with some top 40 music than this will be a place you can enjoy. If your expectations are higher than that you should keep going because this will not meet your expectations   Now onto the ambience and food- the decor is interesting with a car pool table and lots of tv's and 2 separate large rooms kind of a modern laid back type of vibe is what you will get. I think this is definitely more of a day time spot when you need a bite to eat that's reasonable or a drink recharge so you can keep pushing on down the strip . The food is above average and the portion sizes are decent with most items, the best part of the food is the price and the fact that they have happy hour and they do taco tuesdays.   If I was in the area I would come back again especially since the people serving me were nice",

    "text": "I was here a couple months ago during a trip to Las Vegas. This place is located inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino. It is located next to Carlo's Bakery.   We stopped in here simply because we had been to visit Carlo's Bakery, but they had nowhere to sit and eat what we had bought. I find this annoying, but such is life. There were tables at the entrance here, so we asked the bartender if we could sit and eat. We weren't customers, but she welcomed us to sit and eat. She offered us samples that she was handing out, which was nice. If we weren't leaving Vegas an hour after this stop, I would have taken the time to check out the menu and have a drink.   The customer service was great, especially given the fact all we wanted to do was sit and eat something we had bought next door. I definitely appreciated that, and the fact the bartender had no problem with this. It was sweet. We weren't there for long, but she engaged us in conversation, and just gave excellent customer service.   Would I return? Yes. Based on the customer service, it would definitely be somewhere I would return and take the time to eat and drink here. It was a great experience. Which seemed to be a trend while we were in Vegas. For as busy as it was, everyone was kind and helpful.   Review 115 of 2017.",

    "text": "I am writing this review as a warning to everyone visiting Las Vegas, as I'm certain that Rockhouse isn't the only place with staff doing this. On Saturday, Feb 23/19, my boyfriend and his friend (both males in their mid-thirties) went to Rockhouse at around midnight for 1 beer. Both myself and my girlfriend went somewhere else. Fast forward 5 hours later... the guys finally make their way back to our room (although they were split up) and they were completely incoherent (but not \"drunk\" incoherent, it was \"roofie\" blackout). And how are we certain it happened at Rockhouse? Both my boyfriend and his friend were dead sober when they sat down for the beer there and then suddenly blacked out after that. Neither of them remember anything, except that the guy serving them at Rockhouse was \"really odd and abrasive\" - and again, they had 1 beer and don't remember ANYTHING after that. We discovered the next day that $1400 was missing from our friend's bank account that night. YES, GENTLEMEN - YOU CAN GET DRUGGED TOO. Sketchy people want money/wallets/valuables and it's a lot easier to get from someone who is downright unable to function! Please be careful. Apparently this is an ongoing thing in Vegas (more so common at stripclubs I've heard?), so just be careful and remember to \"share your location\" with someone sober so that you can be tracked if something like this happens!   A message for the management of Rockhouse: please look into this situation and hopefully you can find out which staff member was working that evening and would potentially drug people.",

They were playing good music and had the sports channels on.  We ordered our beers and were able to hang out and chill for a while.  It was a good spot to do it.  They had this pretty cool looking pool table, but don't get too close, the felt looks like someone threw up all over it.  Other than that it was clean and the service was spot on.",

I also found a cool drink app called Cityzen the offers drink specials for The Rockhouse 4hrs of open bar access: $35 weekday open bar and $50 weekend open bar.

Most restaurants you don't see a manager unless there's a problem but the manager here we saw 3 times for minor things like tv channel changes and music. 5 stars would recommend to any Las Vegas new comer or resident we got great suggestions from the support staff that mad this trip even better!

But I persisted here through the night, to see if anything great came up. Nope. The crowd came, and filled up with a crowd that is not my type. The place turned out to be a mix between a bro bar and a ghetto hip hop club. Even my old bud finally came to realize that it was a bad choice to come here. We took off shortly thereafter. I see the concept behind this place, but it is not a concept for me. Thanks anyway, folks.",

The drinks are expensive ($7 for a beer, $12-$14 for an 8oz. mixed drink), but that's nothing new for the strip. I remember asking one of the bartenders for a glass of water, and he looked at me like I was asking for too much. He literally poured me a shot of water, handed it to me, expecting me to get a kick at his \"sense of humor\". C'mon dude. Just gimmie what I asked for. I'm not here to witness your attempt at comedy. (As haughty as that may sound...)    The DJ seriously sucked that night. He played  a few good songs, but he didn't know how to make smooth transitions between songs.  I like that they've got a couple of beer pong tables right next to the mechanical bull and smokers can puff away right on the other side of that.  Oh yeah!

It is definitedly fun to dip them into all the sauces; all are spicy, bold, sweet; something to satisfy all the tastebuds.  The onion rings are crispy & greasless with a perfect onion to badder ratio; perfect with the ranch sauce.  The fries are crispy golden & definitely hit the spot.  Round it off with one of their house beers & you will not be disappointed.

Rarely happens unless you're spending your children's college tuition or you look like Thor. Then, you'll probably get great service.  2. The manager was also really attentive. He kept coming to our tables and checking on us. Again, super rare in Vegas and in Venetian, no less.  3. The bouncer or door man was friendly and funny.    4. DJ Slip rocked the house. Yay for old school hip hop.   5. Our private area had video game machines for tables! Near the front of the bar were a bunch of pool tables. And, for those looking for a bit of adventure or a good workout, there's a mechanical bull and some stripper poles.   6. Finally, for $40, you can get unlimited drinks. And since our waitress was so attentive, everyone who took advantage of this offer in our group got their money's worth. (What a deal compared to the $11 that I paid at the pool for a virgin pina colada! Grrrr.)",

The space is nice, with areas for chicken rider watching, fresh air, canoodling, and playing.  Take your pick - big Jenga, shuffleboard, pool, beer pong. . . . plenty to keep you entertained.  Dancing too, of course dancing. Staff is always really friendly, but they need to figure out their layout for buffets a little bit better.  A good spot to catch up with friends and have fun.",

That's right folks, we were here on a College Saturday, in the last week of season.  Conference Championship games were being played across the country and 85% of the TVs were tuned to... wait for it.... Rodeo.  What the ??!?!    After we asked they were so kind to give us 1 of their 80 TVs to the game we wanted. I have nothing against the Rodeo, but really?!   Food wise, it's a 1 star.   Average bar food.  Probably edible if your drunk, which is quite encouraged there with their $100 or $50 \"Drink All You Want... All Day\" options depending on the time you get there.    Oh and strangely we ate breakfast here too. How, why? Don't ask....but let me just offer this advice, don't order the hot dogs for breakfast. You'll regret it. I know, it seems obvious.  There are better options in Vegas for almost everything you'd get out of the Rockhouse.",

Taco#1 I ordered one of the chicken tacos, and it was cold and swimming in chili oil. Why?!   Taco #2 was the swordfish taco that was so old, dry and cold that I thought it too was either chicken or some sort of off-colored jerky.  Taco #3 another chicken taco that was mediocre and cold.  Our sever was not that great either. She was forgetful and a little ditzy.  Oh, I had hoped the margarita would redeem the meal, but it was weak and watered down and just plain gross.  This atmosphere is for clubbing and dancing only. Please DON'T EAT HERE.  Go there drunk and dance your pants off, and then go eat elsewhere.",

I ordered a beer for about $8.00, not bad for the strip, but then I saw some folks with a big plastic pitcher, they stated it was $10.00 during happy hour. I was like crap I paid $8.00 for one beer, the BT asked me if I wanted one of the pitchers so I said sure. Cool part his manager said I could have it for the $8.00 I already paid. Score! That's the kind of service that brings me back to places, and I will come back again for sure to this bar for a pitcher during HH!",

The main reason for electing to lunch here, well the ONLY reason, was that they had a lunch special for conference attendees:  $10 for a cheeseburger, fries and a soda.  Great deal.  Since I'm not the pickiest of eaters, I thought it was pretty good.  Granted, it was a cheeseburger at a sports bar, so I wasn't expecting too much.  The service was just OK.  However, being this is Vegas, it should have been GREAT, but . . . it wasn't.  The place was loud (as to be expected for a sports bar), so don't expect to carry on any type of meaningful conversation whatsoever.

To be honest I can't bash this place like everyone on yelp else for no reason. From getting us seated to taking our orders, to bringing out the food! Amazing Service. Yes for Vegas you can say it was a little on the vacant side since my girlfriend and I were seated in seconds and we questioned if its a good idea to even order? and guess what, it WAS!   Lots of flavor on the cheese burger, it was exactly what a cheeseburger needed to be! Juicy, all the proper fixins and a perfect bun ! (just wish it had more meat though, patty is thin but super tasty!)   They wings? they could have gotten some more love on the flavor wagon but hats off the the chef for savin me a buck and fillin us up! We loved it all.    (P.S.

Patrick's day? So awk. After requesting different music he straight up said \"cant control the music. It's on a set playlist\" after about half an hour of complaining he FINALLY CHANGES IT. It was still bunk tho. But atleast it wasnt any viking music. Come to find out the manager hates Mexicans? So was he doing this out of spite? Idk. Awk. Wont be coming back. He legit did it on purpose. We popped up to the other side of the bar and it had way better crackin music. So yeah. He sucks. The waitresses, bartenders, and hostess were legit tho. And they felt bad for us. They were tight. John the manager sucks.",

My wife got a grilled cheese which she didn't really like it was, two burger buns with cheese... she did say the fries were good. I was really excited to get the deep-fried Twinkie however it had tons of whip cream and cheap chocolate drizzled on top which took away from the deep-fried Twinkie. The staff were how do I say \"weird.\" There weren't very many people there eating so the staff kept looking at us like we had a spiders on her face or something. Almost like they didn't think we should be there yet. The price was so so. We will never go back. We went during the day maybe it's better at night?",

I felt like we witnessed more arguments and upsets then we did anyone drinking or having (dare I say) fun?... I'm in disbelief that this place is affiliated with the Venetian or that any company would allow a venue to run in such terrible conditions, with horrid customer service, dirty/gross bathroom facilities, and the overwhelming amount of low class that seemed to add to all the battles between staff and customers.... I recommend you stay far away from rockhouse, they will ruin any aspect of you day/night. They are literally sucking the soul out of Vegas.",

    "text": "Ever since they fired the entire server/bartender staff last summer as a cover for the questionable accounting practices of mgmt, this place has STRUGGLED to find its footing.  They've tried to \"reinvent\" themselves by redoing the decor and seating, but they've gone through numerous new employees while scaling down and building back up their food menu, and still, after three return visits, their lunch service is near incompetent.  From the new interim menu months back being all a la carte and charging $8 for a small cup of fries, to the second visit where the server didn't know the revised new menu and they served what was supposed to be a Big Mac clone but was only a single burger with thousand island dressing with a $4 upcharge and completely messing up the bill between three of us, to this latest visit where there was no one there when we arrived, but started filling up with CES people shortly thereafter and the server disappeared often, still couldn't bring us sides of ketchup, mustard, and ranch after asking three times, waiting 20 min for a drink refill, waiting 20 min for our bill and then waiting another 30 min for her to come get it, it was unbelievable.  They obviously were slammed by CES people but that's no excuse, it's Vegas, it happens often.  At times every employee there was running around not doing anything like they were trying to look busy but were just overwhelmed and secretly didn't know what to do. A guy who could have been the mgr was bringing out drinks to some tables but not checking to see if others needed anything, and it was obvious just from looking that there were several tables that did.  It was impossible to make eye contact with another server or hostess to get someone to take our bill because it seemed that no one there was paying any attention, except for the server who spent the entire time we were there talking to a couple of guys at an adjacent table and ignoring all her other tables. We rarely go here now, and this is the reason why.  The only reason we went there today was because we knew they wouldn't be as busy as every other restaurant on property.   Oh, as for the food?  It wasn't too bad. Worth going back for and dealing with all the other crap?  Not unless it's the last resort option.  And then maybe.",

It's a fun restaurant/bar with the things you'd expect like food and drinks, plus other things you wouldn't expect like a leopard pool table, beer pong and a mechanical bull. With TV screens all around to watch sports, I could honestly see myself hanging out here for several hours (on the right night).  I came here with Drew A., Kevin L. and Shane N. The night we came was Halloween, so this was our pre-party spot not our final destination. They were however hosting a costume contest and had special Halloween inspired $5 drink specials. I tried the Irish-American Pie: Pinnacle Pumpkin Vodka, Hiram Walker Irish Pumpkin Spice and Half and Half, it was decent, but I could only handle one before I wanted something else.  Their menu is basically several versions of sliders, tacos and hot dogs but the cool thing is if you don't find a combo you like they also have a 'create your own' menu on the flip side. You choose the toppings and meat you want and you can truly create your own burger, hot dog or tacos. Shane and I tried the Philly Cheese Steak Sliders and they were delicious!  The staff was attentive and even were nice enough to take photos for us of us in our costumes. Before we headed on, Drew rode the mechanical Bull like a champ (yes there are pictures)! It's free for girls and $5 for guys.  If you're tired of the same old same old on the Vegas Strip, this place would be worth checking out.",

    "text": "\"Dive bar\" is appropriate. Funky little joint situated at the end of a lengthy corridor. From inside the Venetian/Palazzo, if you don't know where you're going, you'll probably never find it. We were actually planning to go to the restaurant across the hall from this place, but it was not open so we went in here instead.  Initial impression was that it could be a really cool joint. It has a funky vibe to it that isn't quite \"bar\" and isn't quite \"restaurant\". We managed to snag a nice spot by the big opening window/wall area where we could overlook the Strip. Only problem, which became apparent very quickly, was that the waitress didn't seem to want to come over there and \"wait\" on us. After sitting there for a rather lengthy time she finally stopped by and said \"Oh, I didn't see you guys over here\" after walking right past us a half dozen times.  I came back a couple times after the first visit and found the service to be roughly the same. If you're in any sort of hurry, steer clear! The food was decent. It wasn't amazing, like so many other food options on the Strip. But it wasn't bad either. The Taco Tuesday menu was actually really nice and I sampled about half of that menu. Given the chance, I'd just order the tacos if I were you. they are actually really good.  The mechanical bull was entertaining to watch after the sun went down. With a funky mix of \"urban cowboys\", dudes looking to \"score\" and girls who fawn over beer pong this place can be rather entertaining at night. But the lack of quality service in a town known for customer service leads me to knock some stars off my rating. I shouldn't have to sit there for 10 minutes (each time I went there) before someone finally waits on me.",

They are very generous with the pours, and our server always refilled our glasses prior to finishing the previous ones.  I don't really recommend the food- it's a bit too junky, even for bar food. We had the loaded french fries and wings, and didn't much care for them.

It was hot as hell outside and we didn't feel like walking any further so we decided to stop in. It wasn't super busy, but took us a long time to be waited on. The bartender seemed nice, said she was going to pour a \"healthy\" shot. Who wouldn't want to hear that,  right? The shot she poured was a decent amount. I wanted a strawberry pina colada daiquiri. She only poured strawberry so she had to pour some of it out to put in the pina colada. She poured another shot of \"rum\" on top. I am somewhat of a lightweight and extremely sensitive to alcohol taste so I immediately think that I won't be able to drink this drink at all, because it'll be so strong. There was no liquor in those drinks at all. That \"house rum\" must've definitely been \"house water.\" Super disappointing as my first drink of the day. I would never recommend getting drinks from there, unless it was a fresh bottle or can of beer.  On a more positive note, the wings were good. We ordered Jamaican jerk and hot wings. The hot were 10x better in my opinion.",

I was actually here when it was Smokin' Hot Aces a few years ago.  I really like what they've done with the rennovations and decor.  The Rockhouse is actually a decent venue albeit the location (2nd floor of the Venetian l Palazzo down a corridor by Barney's New York and across from First Food) isn't exactly the best.  Unfortunately, I have never been to the old Rockhouse at Imperial Palace, so I have no basis of comparison.  Our server, Ashley, was incredibly friendly and charismatic.  She did a great job taking care of our large group during such a busy time.  The food is pretty good for bar food.  Just a note though, most of their portions are small, almost tapas-esque.  I had the chipotle chicken sliders.  They had a nice tame kick to them.  I kept seeing people order the tacos and mini corn dog thingys (which were really cute btw) and all the food received moans and nods of approval.   The bar has 65 TVs, pool tables, foosball, beer pong, a mechanical bull, cheap drinks, and multiple entry points. I highly recommend it if you're on the strip or in town visiting.",

We were looking for something to do after the Rock of Ages show, attempting to make our way to another casino and BAM we walked right past this place. I saw the \"live band karaoke\" sign and knew we had to go in; our friends who live in Vegas are HUGE karaoke fans, the husband is a great singer.   So yeah, definitely the vibe of a dive bar... there's beer pong but that's common in Vegas so we were used to it. They had IPA's along with your standard Coors or Bud.   Our server was great - very attentive.",

We were promptly seated by the hostess and it went downhill from there.  We waited nearly 20 minutes before a waitress showed up.  We had waited so long we had all decided what we were going to eat in addition to our drinks.  She took our drink orders but refused to take our food order also.  Another 10 minutes elapsed before our drinks arrived by another waitress who also declined to take our food order.  We waited approximately 30 minutes before another waitress showed up to take our food order.  The ironic thing is the restaurant was nearly empty.  Food arrived rather quick but it was so bad I could not finish my chicken and avocado sliders.  It tasted like gas station food.  I asked for the tab so I could get out of there because the service and food  was so bad.  It took nearly an hour.  I finally got a hold of two separate servers before our bill was presented.  I do not recomemmend Rock House.  There is an obvious problem with management and training.  Staff was rude.  Bottom line, eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "I purchased a groupon deal. An all day wristband that allows u unlimited cocktails (draft beers, well drink and wine) for $24.99. Thought this was an awesome deal especially because their beers are $7 each. When we first arrived we were escorted by the friendly hostess to the bar area in the rear. There was 1 bartender at the time (a  short black girl with glasses, sorry cant remember her name, but she appeared to be the only black girl working there at that time)... I wasnt too worried about there only being 1 bartender because it was only about 5 people in the bar at that time. She asked for our IDs, we showed them and soon as we informed her that we had groupon deals its like her attitude completely changed! It took her LITERALLY 20mins to give us a cran & vodka. Keep in mind there were only about 5people at the bar (not including us, party of 2)!!!!! We watched her wait on a small group of women (4 older ladies), who entered the bar about 10mins AFTER we did, while we still hadnt received our cran and vodka order.  We didnt even bother to order food here because her service was so BAD! We took our 1 drink and left. We grabbed a bite from another hotel and went back about 1 1/2 hours later hoping she would have a better attitude and we'd get better service. WRONG!!! This time there were about 7 or 8 people at the bar... We grabbed 2 of the many seats open at the bar, the same bartender walked past us at least 3 time without even acknowledging us. We sat for another 5mins before she walked over to 2 girls that were sitting beside us (who had just finished their meal, drinks and were getting ready to pay the bill) & held a 10min convo with them, still not asking if we needed to order or cared for a drink! We got up and went to the bar in the front dining area of this place (which was closed the 1st time we came in earlier) & we were greeted and served right away! The bartender in the rear ruined the experience for us and we wont be back if shes bartending.",

We got moved tables three different times, finally put our drink order in with our waitress, .....then crickets for 30 minutes.... Finally had a new waitress come over with a tray of a few drinks, had to re-order several of the drinks... The new waitress had a serious attitude and told proceeds to tell us that our waitress had completely just walked off the job, and that basically she's doing us a favor taking our order....um wow okaaaayyyy... The manager is standing by the bar doing absolutely nothing... Off she goes to the bar to put in our order of 6 more ice teas and cokes... Or whatever the simple order was... I even walked up to the bar after waiting so long for a cold glass for my beer...Another 15-20 minutes go by and she finally comes back and still doesn't have all the drinks...unbelievable... And remember we are getting attitude the entire time... We all decide we will not be dining there, I ask for my tab and she brings the entire check, ATTITUDE HUGE now, manager still doing nothing... The check for watered down ice teas ice melted, and one warm beer is $42!!!! No one did anything to let our party know about the waitress issue or even offer to pick up the ice teas which cost them about .10 cents... The waitress was the worst, the manager is useless, and all they wanted wS their $42 + tip for ice teas!!!!!!      In my opinion being in Vegas a million times being at dive bars to the most elegant, .... This place is by far the worst experience I have EVER had in Vegas in my entire life!!!!!!!!!",

The daily deal is buy 1 drink and get 1 free and they do hold their word to it which is great. The food is hit or miss, as the chips were stale but the philly cheese steak sliders weren't bad just a little salty. They offer a $50 open bar deal where it's all you can drink for only $50 but it doesn't include all the alcohol there, only a selected menu. The music is classic rock to modern day hits. The staff was hit or miss as some were great and others not too quick to serve you. Some of the staff, mainly a guy, had a real gutter mouth on him, it's not a bad thing for me but I did notice kids were present and ladies as well, plus it's not a real dive bar in a crappy part of town so tone it down there guy. The bar is divided into 2 sections, the main area with the mechanical bull and the smaller side bar with the pull table. I would definitely come back here but they can use better quality food and reevaluate their staff being the prime location they're in. Hopefully a future 4 to 5 star rating next time.",

The $50 all you can drink wristband was what drew us in. It is valid all day and you don't have to sit there, you can come and go as you please. I didn't want to have to wear high heels and dress, though I did wear a skirt. There is no real dress code or 1000 people line up to get in. All of this appeals to me. I just want to have fun now and not wait in line for hours. The only downside I saw to the $50 wristband is that you can't get doubles, has to be mixed, and they don't really seem to be in a rush to serve you. There were a couple bartenders that were great. A couple that completely ignored me. That almost killed the night!  The pool table was a little lopsided, maybe even lumpy. I am not that bad at pool, but I did have a few drinks in me. The mechanical bull was fun to watch, couldn't quite drink up enough courage to give it a shot.   They usually have to move tables to get a dance floor going, but there wasn't a lot of people when we were there so they didn't bother. There was a menu as well, but I didn't partake. From the looks of the food coming out, it was on par with any standard pub. I really liked the location, the type of venue, and just the general atmosphere. I will definitely be back.",

There weren't as many people/customers since it was earlier in the night yet we were ignored for over 20 minutes. A friend of mine and I were standing at the middle of the bar and tried to get the bartenders attention but did not have much luck. We walked out disappointed. From there, we went to Tao and had a great night.   We stayed 5 nights in Vegas and this is the only place that disappointed us. You have a great location and the music sound fun too but the service has to be improved.",

There's even a mechanical bull to match. The only problem is that the beer choices are also out of a roadhouse bar so don't expect much beyond \"lite\" beer. While there the two interesting crafty sounding ones on tap were both kicked, further limiting the options. Service is friendly when you can get their attention, which even when not busy, isn't easy. It's a good spot to hang out to watch a game with a fairly low key and somewhat peaceful atmosphere, and the music here is excellent.",

We thought we'd get something to eat while we waited for the first act to come out and we weren't impressed with the food. $13 for three little sliders. We thought they were going to come with fries or something, given the price, but no sides. Their food is ok, but I think it's overpriced. I probably wouldn't eat there again. The comedy show had a few good jokes, but a lot of it, I wasn't laughing at. The crowd was pretty quiet.",

You contain none of the features found in a good dive bar or an ultra lounge. You are a sports bar, Rockhouse. Own it (or take down your 80+ tv's playing sports).   Unfortunately, they fail at the sports bar elements too. Drink prices at $8/shot and $12/cocktail? Huh. Why are you here? I can get a (better) $12 cocktail at a reputable joint somewhere else in the Venetian. Isn't this a $5 pint of Jack 'n coke type of place? WTF? The food was a fail for me as well. The grilled chicken and avocado sliders should be renamed \"wood chip served between a sawdust bun\" as they were dry, tiny and tasteless. Sure, you can come here with good company (as I did) and have fun, but that can be done anywhere in the area.   Oh yea, they have a mechanical bull. Ride it. NEXT!",

The bartender Marisa unfortunately wasn't very helpful with the menu suggestions, and didn't actually seem like she wanted to be there; We've all had bad days, I guess. I found the place thanks to the cityzen app that used my location and offered me a free drink. Mind you the app had no restrictions or stipulations which required a manager override. The free beer and or shot had a value of up to $10 yet my $9 IPA was an issue. Miss Manager, don't argue with a paying customer or make them feel like they're bothering you. Credit the check and take it up with your marketing department as there were no specifics on the app.",

Finally asks if I want to order food, I say yes and she walks away and takes 2 more.drink orders. Food comes out and the runner gives my burger to someone else and takes my wife's wings back to the kitchen. 4 minutes later he tries to give us cold wings. I asked if those are the same wings he brought out earlier and returned to the kitchen and he said yes. I said I will not take cold wings. My bacon cheese burger comes out with cold cheese and the wings are now burnt because they but the old wings in the broiler or salamander. Clark County Health Department will here about this.

    "text": "Methinks not indeed. I'd skip it. This is a spot in the Venetian. You have to exit the casino, though, to access it as it's only accessible from outside, not inside. And it sure seems like a random place to have at a place like the Venetian. One of these things is not like the other... It's a real classy place with sticky floors, sticky chairs, and scantily-clad server and bartenders. Oh, and the food is crappy and over-priced. But if you've ever wanted to ride a mechanical rooster (as opposed to a mechanical bull), this is your spot.  I came here for the Rockstar Karaoke. Meh. Awesome band and karaoke. Crappy place for it. The stage is small and oddly shaped. And there's really nowhere you can sit that actually gives you a view of the stage. There's a small dance floor area right in front of the stage. But here's the kicker: it's also right in front of the main (and only) entrance! So you get to fight your way through a bunch of dancing drunk people to get in and out of the place. It's like running a gauntlet. No thanks.  When you enter, they entice you with 2-for-1 drink cards. I ordered from the bartender and handed her my card. I ordered again and handed her another card. I get the bill and I didn't get my drinks as 2-for-1. I eavesdrop on her convo with the guy sitting next to me at the bar and hear her tell him it's not good for any of the drinks on the specials board. He tries to hand her the card and she stops him and tells him this. I hand her not one, but two, cards and she takes them and says nothing. And then hands me a bill charging me for all the drinks. WTF? Oh, and it took me 30 minutes to get a menu from her, no exaggeration. And she never came back over to ask if I wanted anything.  To make matters worse, when my credit card charge went through on my account, they added a $1 to the amount I had signed for! And then they processed a 2nd charge for $4.32! I remain completely clueless as to what that charge was for. WTF?!  Yeah, to say my experience here was not pleasant would be an understatement. Not a fun place. Not an enjoyable place. So many problems with this spot.",

We came in right at 10 and we were told we could watch any game. We asked that the channel be changed for the Seahawks and they at first couldn't find it.   We eventually found out we had to wait for the stupid game before it up end which had gone into OT.   One would think that as a sports bar they would have the sports package on tv that would allow them to watch any game.   Regardless we ordered bloody Mary's (horrible and chunky) and some food while waiting to watch our game. After missing the entire first quarter we finally got to see our game.   Food came:  flavor flav chicken (3 stars), chips and guacamole (chips were stale), spinach artichoke dip(horrid), jalapeno poppers (so so)... and the topper, I ordered ice cream and they were out. I truly feel like this has been the biggest waste of my time and money since coming up Vegas. I will not be returning.",

There are two major rooms, each with their own bar.  In the smaller room you have your bar but then you have party areas like beer pong tables, pool tables.    In the other room you had a whole DJ set up with elevated platform, tons of tables and seats.  There was also a lounge area, private area if you will also and more beer pong tables.  Now if you come here solo or just with one other person thinking it's like a Blue Martini then don't think that way.  I was here with a bunch of friends so we had a great time but doing the solo Vegas strip thing over here, I'm not sure.  Might as well just hop over next door to Tao and do it there.

The mahi mahi were the best with the chicken coming in second.  The fries were amazing, and you should try them.  Our bartender, Eva, was awesome.

They had a special going on where you could spend $50 and it was all you can drink, so most of our group took advantage of that and definitely got their money's worth throughout the length of the game. I personally just had a couple of Bloody Marys, which were okay but not overly strong or as spicy as I would like them to be.  Most of us also ordered food and enjoyed the \"nachos\" with waffle fries instead of chips, the Flava Flav chicken wings, and the veggie sliders (seriously, I would go back to this place just for those veggie sliders).  What made me rank The Rockhouse three stars instead of four is that the service was insanely slow, although this wasn't the fault of our server - she was the only person there for the entire floor in the half of the restaurant where we were sitting. Clearly they need to staff this place better. Additionally, the chairs are insanely uncomfortable - your choice is a backless bar stool or a hard metal bar chair with a back that is at most six inches tall. Not idea if you want to sit for a while to watch a game.",

After 3 hours of requesting a resolution to the issue. A solution was not possible.  We asked for a coin promise from the manager. She was rude and insulting.  The entire bar had cleared out on a Friday night before midnight because of the heat.  She refused to accommodate anyone.  We will never return.   All the manager had to do was move us to a level cation in the bar that did have AC. She was horrible and rude the manager would not even attempt to maintain our business. Pathetic.   Plus for a rock house you would expect rock not hip hop played all night.",

Hard to believe, but that's now our spot! Good jams from back in the day that pick you up and make you feel good. When they are in the house, I get to relive fun moments of my life. Song after song turns into hour after hour. I go home exhausted, but the journey to the strip is SO worth it with Dynamixx and Babae in the house! Love it!!!!",

At 9pm we showed up and we're the first ones in the bar area (where they hold the comedy club) This place is huge!!  We sat at the bar and ordered a bunch of drinks and shots. The bartender Justin was awesome and very attentive. They do have an all you can drink special you can purchase for I believe $50.00.  We opted to pay as we go as we like mix drinks and shots. We ended up spending around the same. We drank Mules,margaritas and Slippery Nipple shots!  We are an older couple and enjoyed the age range here from 20's to 50+ having a great time! Thanks Justin for being a great bartender and we will be back in August with some friends!!",

It is on the second floor inside the north part of the Venetian, and what it is - is a replica of a dream vision of a dive bar. This is NOT a dive bar, but it caters to those who wants one and yet feel the need to stay on the strip. This place is awesome. I will come back here.   I came here on a Sunday, and just so happen they have a $25 breakfast item, plus open bar until 4pm deal. My breakfast tacos was tasty, and I washed it down with way too many rum&cokes. There was a live band that took odd requests, like \"Sing Hotel California in Spanish\".. and they delivered. One patron asked if he could slap the skins for a few songs, and they let him up and drum for a while. It was super laid back and really cool.  This will be a place I will return to, when in Vegas.",

We got here and our hostess told us about the special, waited ten minutes for our drink order to come back (just soda, no alcohol) when our server came to take our order she had no idea what we were talking about and the manager \"let us\" have the special but inky for that day, even though there was clear advertisement about the special by their front doors!!! Our drinks were empty the entire meal, food was probably the best part because it was cheap, there was 6 of us and they would only split the bill two ways, it was too complicated to split the bill more than that they said. Oh and to top it off, not like it was busy, it was 3:15 and they had 5 tables in the restaurant including us.",

    "text": "Allow me to preface this review - I hate leaving negative feedback for any business, as a business owner myself and someone who has volunteered to serve the business community for 10+ years.  Sadly, this situation warrants blasting them instead of having fun, but I like to have fun.  Rockhouse, where do we even begin? Maybe your name should have warned us? Ever since the 80's the LAPD has been trying to knock places with this name down with the batterram; I guess they missed this one due to the terrible location in the middle of 2 major resort properties hidden in the frightfully designed mall?  Tuesday night (12/19/17) After taking a Lyft ride over from Elara where we were staying; we trekked from Palazzo through the cavernous, empty and rather pointless mall towards Rockhouse; excited to redeem our groupon after a lackluster evening the night before at ameriCAN bar at the Linq. After walking nearly half an hour (no exaggeration, really) we finally found Rockhouse.  We were dying of thirst and hungry.  All the TV's in front were on, even though the glorified garage door was down.  Wife said \"oh wow they are closed\"; I am the eternal optimist and said \"maybe just the mall bar is closed since the mall is so empty?\" We were both half right; we tried the large door to the left of the mall bar, it was OPEN!  We excited went in, there was music on!  Several feet into the bar it was evident they were closed even though we were clearly inside the building.  There were what appeared to be those \"bottled water cone cup\" paper cone things over all the bottles in the well and on the shelf. I suggested to my wife that since we were there for an open bar promo, maybe this place just had a self-service vibe and things were just slow? (some all inclusive resorts have self-service bars after all) However, I looked at the website (gotta love smartphones) and found that the hours are \"closed at 10 on mon/tues\" so figured there would be no \"livening up\" tonight. So beside the pathetic nature of drinking alone (although I really did wanna play shuffleboard with her) and missing out on the social nature of a bar; we made the more reasonable choice and left without messing with anything - did I mention there was NO SIGNAGE outside about being shut down for the holidays?  Oh yea I didn't mention that but indeer there was NOT (nor any mention on social media or the website) Wound up having an underwhelming dinner at PrimeBurger and getting a Lyft elsewhere. Thanks for that unnecessary $17 in rides that night. I also made a madbro post on their social media about being closed, no response even today, Saturday, as I write this review. (although they did finally post on the 21st that they are \"closed till the 26th\" wow great job guys!!  After a rather extensive search of social media, we decided Wednesday night would be better!  Maybe people had called off or maybe there was a private event scheduled on Tuesday and execution was just off.  We learned there is a live band on Wednesdays and Rockhouse is open till 2am!  The addition of a cheap open bar special meant there should be plenty of new friends to hang out with - ok let's go!! Whip out the phone, hail the driver, and crawl into the prius or other subcompact you deal with lol.  This time we went to the Venetian to see if hopefully the map was right and the walk was shorter. (I am disabled with a below knee amputation and all the walking of Vegas was starting to get to me a bit) My guess regarding the walk distance was maybe right maybe wrong...I swear this place is exactly in the middle.  Especially loved the overly aggressive people from Tahiti Village we had to fend off at 2 points in the mall from this direction - real upscale Mr. Adelson. Once we vanquished the crusaders, and crossed the river (canal) and crested the mountains; we found Rockhouse again.  CLOSED and locked up tight this time. Right after we started walking away, this casually dressed guy came out.  I approached him and asked him what was going on with the place? I was starting think they got busted by ABC for serving minors or something and was really curious. He explained \"oh, you know we are closed for the holiday\" (I guess we look like locals?) I was all \"nah bruh, I don't know, but I do now\". I then griped at him about the lack of notification and he could only muster a \"not my job\". Another $17 in rides and tons of unnecessary walking, all because someone can't be bothered to post notice on the website, social media, or AT THE VENUE.  So now our week long trip is over, we have this Rockhouse Groupon we can not use, nor do we recommend anyone get it; or waste their time going there. Probably as sad and pathetic as their other place ameriCAN where they write your name on and make you use the same cup all night with the threat of $5 if you lose or break it? We have previously gone to PBR at PH, which is kinda cool and has nice staff.",

Wished I could've gotten exotic drinks instead of domestic. Good place. - Tony.",

That said, for a sports bar on the strip, this is pretty decent. Good college football coverage, decent food, attentive staff.",

    "text": "If your all yuppie,  this is not your place.  But to get out with friends and not have to be pretentious this is a great spot on the strip. Real low key and feels like a back home bar. I went Tuesday night because I want to hear this band called \"Stoked\" Listen to me now.  If you are looking for somewhere on a Tuesday and you like rock music come to the rock house. Stoked was amazing.  I had heard a song on Facebook and being a lover of good ol fashion rock music I went to see them at the Rockhouse at the Venetian on a Tuesday night.  Honestly,  they were amazing.  The lead guitar and vocalist is an incredible musician, every song they play they have a jam session in there to make it unique and maybe better than the original. Bass and drums were really good. But... what makes their sound so unique is the violin played by Rahmaan . Absolutely incredible. He makes every song sound so beautiful.  He along with Ilan the lead  guitar compliment each other in a way I have never seen. The covers of sweet child of mine and hotel California were the best I have ever heard. Truly. Rahmaan can make any sound out of the violin, he makes it cry like you've never heard.  This band will make it one day. I assure you. Book these guys. You will not be disappointed.  What a great band!",
