    "text": "Wish I could speak of the food in the place, as the photos make it look amazing but I'm actually reviewing a service they have that I don't think many would associate w/ an Irish Pub: high tea.  To be honest, we ended up picking this place because most were booked already (it was a rather last minute thing) and when our friend called to ask how the vibe was, we were told that while they are Irish and like to party, they do put out a white table cloth to be on the fancy side lol. Honestly though it was probably one of the best decisions we could have made.  Our server, Rustin was super helpful and friendly, as was everyone else who stopped by to see how we were doing. I'm not sure if high tea is a newer service they're offering or if people don't get it often but we had quite a few different people come up and ask us how we were liking it, which was nice.  In terms of the food/tea itself, the thing that threw me off the most were the portion sizes of the sandwiches, which when compared to other places I've seen were surprisingly large; we were originally planning on doing tea and a brunch later on, but ended up scrapping the brunch altogether because we were so full from the sandwiches, pastries, and scones. I have no idea if they make the pastries in-house or not, but the scones were great, and they do make their own Irish soda bread which was lovely as well. And considering the price is at a comfortable $22 per person, it was probably one of our more comfortably affordable meals as well.  Decently sized tea selection, and the decor was a rather amusing contrast given the fact that we were in the backroom of a pub decorated with old knick-nacks, but sitting at a table with a white table cloth and a cute mismatched tea set. If I ever visit Vegas again I definitely think I'd be stopping by for a return visit.",

    "text": "Finding a really good place to eat in Vegas can be difficult since most businesses on yelp have no less than 4 stars.  Everyone loves everything here! And it's not necessarily because everything is amazing.  I'm guessing it's cause this town is like Disney World for adults and the general temperament is cheery.  We came here for an authentic Irish breakfast and we got it! We sat at the bar and had amazing service from the bar tender.  He was attentive, informative, and friendly.   I hadn't had coffee yet and needed some badly when I saw Irish coffee on the menu. I had never tried one and couldn't think of a better place/time for my first one.  All I can say is WOW! It was delicious.  I don't have anything to compare it to, but I'm pretty sure I've been spoiled with the best Irish Coffee I'll ever try.  It was entirely handcrafted with Powers whiskey, French pressed coffee, and fresh whipped unsweetened cream (I watched him as he whipped it himself). The combination of the cool cream and the warm coffee was amazing. I want another one as I write this.           I ordered the Sausage & Egg Boxty: scrambled eggs with sausage, peppers, and cheddar cheese wrapped in a potato pancake. Hollandaise sauce is poured over the top to finish it off. Yum! The flavors all complimented themselves perfectly and nothing was overpowering.    You can't go wrong coming here... they also have great beer selections and live music at night.  I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Heard a lot about this place and saw a ton of positive reviews (mostly tourist reviews).  Decided to take the family out to dinner there on a Friday evening - they give Las Vegas locals a discount on Fridays.  We had a party of six (automatic 25% gratuity added on for that), and our waiter was not the most engaging person.  I ordered the chicken wings (volcano), and was informed by the waiter that they would be too hot for me and basically inedible.  I had to fight with him to get the volcano wings - which as it turns out weren't that hot.  The rest of the meal was good and everyone enjoyed their meals for the most part.  The beer was great of course and our service was a tad slower than I'm used to.  As we prepared to pay the bill we informed the waiter that we were locals asking for the offered discount - normally I would expect the person paying to be the one showing the identification as proof of residency but everyone in the group had to show ID.  My problem is I have a underage child that has no ID and I took an out of town friend - full price for both.  I know it's a casino restaurant that would probably prefer tourist to locals, but I like supporting my community businesses.  --Disappointed but not surprised",

    "text": "I loved how cozy this place is. We came on a weeknight for dinner and there was no wait, and it was quiet and intimate.  Our server, Sinead, was very friendly and checked on us often.  We ordered the sausage rolls as an appetizer.  They were a little on the salty side for my taste, but weren't bad.  I ordered the Dubliner, and my husband ordered the Mum's Meatloaf burger.  His was so big he had to eat it with a fork.  It was a little dry (which was to be expected since you pile mashed potatoes on top of the meatloaf patty).  But he loved it and said it was delicious.  It's something he would absolutely order again.  I loved the Dubliner.  It was something new that I've never tried before, and I'm glad I tried it.  The only slight complaint was that it had a bit too much of the thick sauce for my taste, but that was easily fixed.  I loved that they weren't stingy with the red onions on the burger.  I ordered the Irish coffee for dessert and was extremely pleased with it.  Most dessert drinks are sickeningly sweet but this was not.  It was satisfying and felt like something youd drink while curled up in front of the fire on a rainy day.  Great service, good food, nice atmosphere, and it didn't break the bank.  We will definitely come back.",

And he's operating an electronic synthesizer with his foot.  The music was so loud that the four of us couldn't hear each other.  We ordered a late dinner from a great personable server, Carl, whose roots are from Dublin, Ireland.   We started a conversation with him which led to great food suggestions from him and great laughter.  The four of us split the beef shepherd pie and the fish and chips.  Both were very good.  The fish was a huge filet across a dinner platter.  And we had beer.  What else would you drink in a pub?  Maybe Irish whiskey.  There's an iPad with all the various Irish whiskeys that you can read up on.  Ask the server if you're interested.  As the evening wore on, the music either toned down or we adjusted with our own noise. The duo was great.  I'm sorry I didn't catch the name.    We finished up with the housemade pumpkin pie which was more like pumpkin bread pudding.   So good.  The pub is located in the annex of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino.",

Not sure I have ever had dinner at that hour before- that's Las Vegas for you.    Ordered a mojito to drink- I know not a great Irish choice but I was craving one.  Turned out to be a bad choice.  Not great at all.  Think it cost $9.  Got the cup of Potato Leek soup from the specials menu.  I was suprised to learn it was vegetarian and it was DELICIOUS!!  Even the bread it came with was yummy- smells terrible was tasted great.  Loved that they serve Irish butter!!  I also ordered the potato cakes off the appetizer menu.  Very yummy.  Recommend!  My husband got the corned beef and cabbage with mashed potatoes.  He liked it but suprised to find it served with gravy which contained wheat to thicken it.  He tries to eat gluten free.",

The bartender did not know how to make a sidecar so my order was his first time.  The drink was on the weak side and was missing the sugar rim, but I won't count it against them.  I noticed that customers in the restaurant were about 80% women.  I don't know if there was a special event going on or if this place is a favorite hangout with women.  The restaurant was almost full but we found a table in the back corner.    There's a Guiness store next door.  The waiter said it's the only Guiness store outside of Ireland.  Don't know if it's True or not but there's a lot of good gift ideas in the store.  I would like to return again next time I'm in Vegas.",

We were least familiar with Irish pub food, but I'm so glad we went for it here rather than settle for the blander menus at the other places. Everyone was friendly (drunk) and it made me long to visit my motherland someday - I envision Ireland as green and beer.   We had the beef + Guinness stew and Shepherd's Pie, which really hit the spot along with their soda bread. I should have had a Guinness with it but wasn't in the mood for beer, so I went with a cocktail. Mistake! When in pubs, order beer.",

If you have a chance, sit at the bar and have lunch or dinner, you can people watch or enjoy the atmosphere.  They do have drink specials as well and the bartenders I believe are all from Ireland.  The Guinness store next to it has a lot of branded items that are cool to see too.  I will plan to visit again, hopefully for dinner, overall the food was very good.",

It did not disappoint, and is now my favorite Irish pub in the Vegas area.  The first thing that jumped out at me was the fun and festive atmosphere. It has it's entrance right from the Mandalay hotel, and the Guinness store is right next door, which is cool. The restaurant has a nice, intimate feel, and you instantly feel comfortable here. I love the way the restaurant is appointed, and it has an intimate feel that is not \"corporate\" in style.   They always seem to have great live entertainment here, and if you're looking for Irish music and entertainment, this is the place to come.   The service here is also great! The bartenders all seem to be Irish! It doesn't get much more authentic than that! They have a great beer selection, and the staff had good expertise. It all makes for a great experience when you eat/drink here.",

Ri-Ra displays an impressive lineup of Irish beer on tap, and an even more impressive selection of Irish Whiskey! Personally, I have never seen a lineup of Jameson like the one they display there. I had no knowledge of a lot of those bottles.  I have been here on several occasions. I make the attempt to dine/patronize here when I am in Las Vegas! The food is very delicious! I have tried most of the burgers on their menu and had the Guinness Stew on my recent trip. Very delicious! I had the lamb burger once maybe a year or two ago, but do not recall seeing it on the menu this trip. Next up I wanna try the Guinness burger before I depart this trip.  The bartenders are very friendly and welcoming and know their \"stuff\" when it comes to Irish beer and spirits, as some of them are Irish themselves! I would definitely recommend this place next time your in Las Vegas! :)",

Everyone that works there is so friendly and makes you feel like you are part of a family! The breakfast is my favorite so we seem to have the same server most of the time. Her name is Debbie and she remembers your order and is a superb employee! Always has a big smile and makes you feel like you're special! If you are looking for something special try the Pub. You will not be disappointed!",

Harp on tap! Service is friendly from greeting and seating, to the free bread and butter, through service and payment. Food arrived quickly and paying the check took no time at all. Just the right amount of attentiveness.",

Love the atmosphere of this pub, having visited pubs in both Dublin and London it was relatively close to authentic, about as good as it can get for a mall in Vegas. The selection of beer and especially whiskey was impressive. They have a LOT more whiskey than they advertise so make sure to ask your server for the list. I was VERY happy that they had Murphy's Irish Stout on tap as it's my favorite. If you like Guinness, you will LOVE Murphy's.   Our food was good for sure, but not great, especially for the prices. Between us we had the mac cheese, a lamb burger, and Irish Stew. Best of the lot was the Irish Stew.   For desert, do NOT miss the Irish Coffee!! It's a real treat.   Very good, not great, but earns a recommendation, especially if you are not eating and just want to drink good Irish beer or whiskey in a great setting.",

The baked goat cheese appetizer was incredible and I highly recommend it!  The beer was cold and the waitress kept it full when requested.  The shepherd's pie? Oh my hell, I'm certain they may have tried to feed me dog food.  It was by far the worst shepherd's pie I've ever had in my life.  This potato lovin' girl was sooo disappointed.  I took it back to my hotel room thinking maybe it would taste better as a midnight drunk snack?  Nope, it was impossible to eat.  Tossed in the garbage.  The chicken and sausage ragout was okay.  Whatever I had for dessert was great.  I would still come back here since everything else was good.  The atmosphere was nice with the live music.  But never will I ever try that shepherd's pie again.",

I ordered the Bangers and Smash and the Good for the Goose Vodka-based cocktail which tasted like a red popsicle. I tried the fish and chips off my other half's plate and honestly wished I had order that. Good thing there was more than enough for leftovers! Our server Sinead- A lovely woman who actually moved here to Las Vegas about a year ago from Ireland where she lived for 30+ years - was amazing! I appreciated her service so much I will be back.

The dinner dishes are typical Irish/English fare of fish and chips, Shepherds Pie, bangers and mash, Guiness ale pie etc. and the chips/fries are awesome. The appetizer scotch eggs and sausage rolls were also excellent.  We came back for a breakfast and were equally as delighted with the full Irish breakfast of fried eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, mushrooms and both black and white pudding. Add a side of baked beans and I was in heaven. It was huge and way cheaper than the lesser alternatives at the hotels.  They have live music around 9pm, TVs everywhere showing various sports and a large selection of beers.   If they had rooms, I'd move in.",

We got a real Guinness pour, which was worth the tough fish. You can't beat a delicious Guinness, fries and a live Irish band. Mr. R had the Guinness Blonde, which was delicious as well. The people watching was almost as exciting as the band.

I was disappointed that they still have poor customer service in the front of the restaurant as once you get inside the staff is friendly. I think I may be eating elsewhere.

This is one of those cases. This is a great Irish restaurant and from what I've heard most of the Decour actually came over from Ireland itself it was transplanted into this restaurant. My wife and I were able to share a meal which I asked ahead of time for and we shared the Caesar salad. We had ordered the fish and chips which I believe was haddock and really good. I'm not a big fish and chip person unless it's really good and this was.  You get one big piece of fish which two people can easily share.  The bathrooms in this place are actually outside of the restaurant in the mall part. Before we went to this restaurant we went to the Guinness store next-door.  The next time we come out here I will definitely be making a trip over to this restaurant again.",

Ri Ra is a cozy Irish Pub that serves good food, beer, and custom cocktails. They also host, late night, live music. For breakfast, I like the Irish Benedict, for lunch & dinner, I like their Fish & Chips, Bangers & Mash, or an order of their Shepherd's Pie or Guinness Stew. They stay open until 3AM.  Vegas has quite a few good Irish Pubs (McMullens and the Nine Fine Irishmen are my other favorites) but I find myself coming back here often because I like the ambiance and location. The bar is beautiful and apparently shipped all the way from a pub in Ireland. Breakfast and lunch averages $16 a person and dinner averages around $22. Service is hit or miss (MOST of the time it is way too slow and they are almost always understaffed) but I've been pretty happy with the food.   I find Irish Pubs so comforting and cozy during the winter months. I'm not sure what their affiliation is to the Guinness store next to them, but they pour a really good Guinness beer here. They also have a lot of Guinness menu items such as Guinness stew and Guinness Sundaes.",

I had their Rueben for lunch which was really good and came back the next day for their wings with Guinness BBQ sauce which were outstanding.  It's ashame they don't sell that sauce.

We will now be making the trip to Vegas more often just to visit this pub.  (Previously we would visit every 2 - 3 years, we now plan 3 -4 times a year) Yes this place is that good.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas solo for a conference for a few days and staying at the Mandalay Bay I saw from the tram an Irish pub so I decided to check it out for dinner.  Immediately after entering I felt completely at home and absolutely loved the vibe from the place.   I don't drink but after having the shepherds pie with Guinness and the Guinness chocolate brownie dessert I'm strongly reconsidering my position.  So so very good. But even better was the service. I had no fewer than 4 different bartenders up front stop by and chat with me. Incredibly enough they all were native Irishmen. All were genuine and went out of their way to provide unbelievable service.  Some of the nicest most hospitable waitstaff I've seen anywhere. If they are anything representative of Irish people than I seriously want to sell all my possessions and move my family there. I want my kids raised around people like that.   The food was great, the service was the best I've received in my life and I completely enjoyed every minute spent in this awesome bar. The food was terrific and while i had better food in Vegas, I had no better experience than I did in Ri Ra. It will be the first place I visit again on my next trip through town.   I cannot recommend it highly enough!!",

The first night we took some family with us to eay and they really enjoyed the food. The oniom rings were fresh onions. Someone in our party got the mac and cheese with chicken it was so good.   The next morning  we went back to eat for an early lunch. They open @ 8am for breakfast! I originally wanted sausage rolls but it was still breakfast time. I got the cream cheese bagel in the mean time. I think they bake the bagels there fresh it was great.   On our last trip to the pub we got the Guinness BBQ burger. Once again fresh food.",

Susan and Junior are amazing!!  The food is really good. I tend to stay away from any fish dish unless it's the fish and chips. Every fish dish I have tried otherwise was way overcooked.  They do have the best fish and chips I have had outside of Ireland!  Some of their prices I think are a bit steep for what it is but the fish and chips are definitely worth it! My husband is from Dublin and they also have the best Irish breakfast in the city! Their pub fries with malt mayo are so good. The seafood chowder (one of their soup of the day) is really tasty. As a matter of fact I have never had a bad bowl of soup there.  Their chicken finger are actually really good and I usually don't go for chicken fingers. Their wings are just OK to me. I also have tried the Guinness Stew and that was pretty yummy. My favorite sandwich is their Kilcolly, turkey, cranberry mayo, apple and some kind of cheese, delicious!!  The atmosphere is fun and I enjoy their happy hour, but just so you know it's only food on happy hour 1/2 off apps. Get the smokes salmon platter, my husband orders 2!!   I do believe on Friday nights locals get 20% off. They have a nice selection of beer and a great whiskey list. Ask to look at it, it's nice to look through. I'll probably lose my Duchess status soon since I have been trying to frequent other places. Oh well I have reigned long enough!",

Live house band, lil bit on louder side but great music. The place was packed but still got great seats. They had these pretty red drapes and low lighting very romantic. Our server was very welcoming, in fact everyone was nice. The food was delicious and of course I got my fish & chips.My husbands got a big burger with all the fixings and of course fries.

I've become a regular to this place; especially since it's a great way to kick off the weekend. 40% off food for locals on Fridays, coupled with happy hour app and drink specials; All of which is accessible right when I get out of work? Incredible way to end the work week!  Food is superb--Quality Irish pub food with an emphasis on quality. Here's a rundown of some of food that I've tried:  -Potato cakes: No doubt, the best app I've ordered so far. A Must try. Balsamic glaze on the panko crisp blew my mind. -Jameson glazed wings: I've had similar stuff at Firkin, but Ri Ra was here first. Delicious.  -Irish roast pork: Hefty cuts of pork loin and  roasted potatoes covered in a whiskey gravy, coupled with honey-glazed carrots. Fist bump love for this one. Salad comes with this one too, and well, it's a typical salad. -Fish & Chips: I've had many a fish and chip in my day. The way they do it here is one of my favorites. Plus, it's a huge serving. Order it. Devour it. Enjoy.  Don't be surprised if you see me sitting there on a Friday evening enjoying some pints and grub. Props for showing some local love!",

Luckily, their late night menu goes until 1am, and has a good number of \"full dinner\" choices on it.  Being an Irish pub, I was expecting a few good draught beer, and a couple of good Irish whiskey and perhaps a few different scotches. However, this place has a fairly wide selection available, ranging from regular everyday stuff, to good outside of most people's repertoire brands, and on it to some good rare whiskey that some might kill to try (eg. Usually only available at large private dram club events - and the price tag of those is predictable, if not just a tad outrageous).  As far as our food, it was a welcome late night meal. When asked about the prime rib, our server was honest, saying she didn't find it that special, but it was a popular selection. Overall, she was dead-on... while quite a generous cut at a reasonable price, it was a bit dry (or perhaps a little over the medium rare I selected), but the au jus helped make up for that issue (and really, at well after usual dinner hours, I am not going to complain, anyway - I was happy to not be settling for a simple burger some place).",

    "text": "Great place to get food in Vegas without breaking the bank.  It's one of the only places I know in the states that serves McDonnell's curry.  The Irish breakfast also looks really good and reminds me of all of the B&Bs I frequented in Ireland. I've seen a few reviews here that state that the portions were small, but I found the portions to be quite large.  Your results may vary of course, but this is just my opinion. Definitely check it out, especially if you're looking for dinner in the south end of the strip.",

The portions are deceivingly small, but with all the potatoes, it'll fill you up. The Shepherd's pie could have been baked longer to get a nice browning on the top layer of potatoes. In terms of flavor, I'm glad I stuck with the stew. The amount of meat to potato ratio wasn't too bad.   I'm glad they had a healthy serving of bread before and during our meal with individual serving size of Kerrygold butter.  I definitely would have left hungry if there were lack of carbs.  For $35, strip prices- I'm not sure I'll be back to try anything different here.  We had just missed the live music that was suppose to go on at a later time.",

Due to it being Vegas with a lot of tourists and travelers you will always find fans of various teams catching the soccer games here which makes the experience that much better.",

Food is delicious and they serve many traditional Irish meals. Highly recommend if you like Irish style pubs and if your a constant searcher of legit Irish pubs like me, look no further.

I've had excellent prime rib in Vegas with all the fixings for $7.99. BIG disappointment. Our friend had the cider chop and that was delicious. The service was abysmal. Christina was not attentive at all - we had to go find her a couple of times because she just plain disappeared. We still gave her 20% which was a mistake - I regret having rewarded poor service.

Looked great on the plate, but that's where it ended. The corn beef was quite dry, even with all the sauce, and the mashed potatoes were just instant potatoes. If you try to tell me differently I won't believe you. This restaurant is one of the least expensive in Mandalay Bay, that I was able to find, but not sure if it's worth it.

I had walked by this location a few times while strolling through the touristy shops on the upper level, but I hadn't had the opportunity to go in for a beer or two until just recently. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the warm cozy atmosphere. Truly felt like I was back in Dublin! Plus, they had a live Irish band playing a fantastic set of traditional Irish folk music, which keep me entertained while I sipped on a glass of Guinness and scarfed down some Jameson honey glazed wings. Prices were cheap too and I even found out that locals get 40% off lunch and dinner on Fridays(SCORE!) Now I know that whenever my heart misses and longs for the cozy comforting vibes of a True Irish pub, I can stop in RI Ra, have a tall glass of Guinness and all will be right in my book.",

I called and made a reservation for it prior but I think the hostess never wrote that memo down because when we arrived there we were seated in a regular table in the back area. I was expecting the whole tea set up to already be there, but was disappointed it wasn't set up.   My entire party decided to do the afternoon tea and our waiter was super nice about it when we told him we all wanted to do it. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes before the whole thing was set up.   Once everything was set up we ordered all of the teas and it was surprising that some teas had a lot more caffeine than other ones. Since we all did the afternoon tea it came with Finger sandwiches: Egg mayonnaise, ham and tomato, Irish cheddar and Ballore Relish, cucumber and cream cheese. Home made scones and desserts.  I thought it was nice that they were able to be a little accommodating for my friend who's a vegan. Not many options were able to be modified according to the waiter but it's okay. She still was able to eat some of the food and enjoyed it.   I liked both the earl grey and the green tea that I was able to try. Since I'm pregnant I wasn't able to try the ones with caffeine. I would definitely come back to try the other ones one day. I enjoyed the whole cute set up and the ambience. I thought it was weird though when my husband and friends asked about doing a birthday dessert the waiter charged us $10 for the dessert. Maybe they don't really get birthdays?   Overall, everyone enjoyed their teas and sandwiches. The price was fair for the food and tea served. I wasn't able to take a picture of the menu though because the waiter was so quick to take it before I took my phone out to snap a pic!",

This little Irish gem is located in the Mandalay Bay. The service, food and drinks were great all across the board. I was pleasantly surprised. The bar itself (wood and everything) was actually imported from Ireland.   The bartender was wonderful. Most of the bartenders I noticed that work here are actually from Ireland.    When I sat down, I asked the bartender about a rare Guinness, called the Foreign Extra Stout and he immediately got really excited. He said \"back home we all drink the extra stout, but there is a new 25th anniversary Guinness that is incredible. Best Guinness you'll every taste. Now back home we are all drinking the anniversary stout\".   Of course I had to try it after that introduction. And WOW! It did not disappoint. Best Guinness I have ever tasted in my entire life. Really happy he told me about it.   He also told us Fridays is happy hour all day for locals! What a deal, can't wait to go back and try this place.   Pros: Friendly/knowledgeable staff, great food, good specials, they sell candies from Ireland behind the bar, my dad really enjoyed the Fish & Chips   Cons: Nothing   Tips *** Great place on Fridays with happy hour all day for locals, remember to bring local ID, If you are a fan of Guinness try the 25th special anniversary stout. You won't be disappointed!",

We enjoyed the Reuben sandwich and their beer selection is pretty awesome - I had a Kilkenny which you don't find very often in most places. It's probably even better at night with the pub atmosphere.",

    "text": "I love Ri Ra!  Every time I go to Vegas, I try to stop there for dinner and some drinks.  That's saying something, because I rarely stay that far south on the strip so any trip down by Mandalay Bay is usually due to my craving for potato cakes and soup.  I've eaten here about eight times and each time I leave extremely full and very content.  You wouldn't think it's a big restaurant but you can keep walking back and you'll find room after room...  It's in the Mandalay Bay shopping center (near the Guinness store...smart) and the front room seems like a tiny bar.  The second room is a longer continuation of said bar... and now you've passed about 8 tables.  Then there's another room and in this one, there's room for a band (more on that shortly).  The final room in the back literally reminds me of the Red Room in Twin Peaks... the White Lodge?  Black Lodge?  It's been a while.  Anyway, it has red curtains and the ambiance is just... different.  Not Irish pub-by, so if you can eat in the front three, I recommend it.  The food is great: from their leek soup (I get mine sans bacon) to their Guinness/Jameson wings (my husband is addicted) to the aforementioned potato cakes (upgrade potato pancakes with balsamic drizzle and sour cream) the food is always delish.  The drinks are great too: I typically get beer and it's not easy to find a place that regularly serves Murphy's or Innis and Gunn.  Very refreshing.  The only thing is when there IS a band, the volume is just WAY TOO LOUD for a restaurant.  I was one room away and we were screaming to hear our friends.  That was off-putting.  The music was great but the volume should be at a 4, not an 11.  That won't ever stop me from returning...but it might cause me to call first to obtain a live music schedule. :)",

Expensive yes but I enjoyed it and thats what matters.  I also had their version of poutine. It was good. It was fries topped with gravy, cheese curds and lamb. $14 and so worth it.  They have a live band every night. Service was great!",

The staff was so uncoordinated; one told us to sit at a table, then another told us we can't sit there. Then another said no it's fine then another said \"no sorry you can't sit there unless you are ordering food (which i think she was under the impression we were just having drinks for some reason? As one person wasn't eating Even though most of us were starved and couldn't wait to eat!) she continued with a saucy tone and said \"it is what it is\".  So we got up and left without ordering and went somewhere else.    So much confusion for just wanting a simple meal after a long flight. The most uptight unwelcoming Irish pub I've ever been to. To be fair I'm sure it's not always this way and we might have just been served by the bad apples, but I made sure our 70 guests who flew into town knew not to waste their time attending.",

If that's not to your taste, get a shepherd's pie (grew up on this, also) and  a pint of Guiness. Although, I had a tasting flight of Irish whisky.

We saw this place on our way back to the hotel and it looked decent so we decided to give it a try. They have all your usual pub fare so I got a burger and fries. They'd asked how I wanted my patty and I said \"medium,\" as per usual. What I ended up getting was NOT medium, however. It looked pretty well done, and the quality of the meat seemed meh as well. That was a disappointment, but it wasn't a horrible burger, by any means. Service was friendly if a bit slow--they seemed a little slammed with the late night crowd. Prices were pretty typical for a middling Vegas restaurant. Overall it was fine for what it was, but in the cold light of day feeling more sober I probably would've docked them another star.

My wife ordered a sandwich with side-salad and forgot to mention allergies; when it came out she realized her mistake and asked the server if she could have another without the bell pepper (her allergy). The server immediately whisked the plate away and said she'd be back with a replacement. Within moments a manager came by to ask if my wife was ok and if she could do anything. No sooner had she stepped away then another manager stopped by and asked the same thing. Fantastic proactive customer service. After her replacement meal came, complete with hot sandwich to go with the new salad, all three, the server and both managers came by at different times to make sure things were ok.

They had nonstop live Irish music with musicians who were Irish, and the food was what we saw on menus while we were in Ireland. We would highly recommend this place for the fun venue, culture, and experience. It feels like you're in an Irish home and bar simultaneously. Why not 5 stars? Because I have to eat gluten free and the menu is pretty limited for that- I ended up getting a plain chicken breast (originally a sandwich). Otherwise, wonderful!",

When we got there the hostess was so friendly with a beautiful Irish accent. She swiped my 2 month old out of my arms and started showing her off... In that moment I knew we were in an authentic Irish pub. While it is not geared towards families, my family was welcomed with open arms. The food was fantastic and the serving staff embraced the children with us. The band was fantastic and even played Black Velvet Band for my husband, who requested it for his Birthday, I truly felt like I was in a pub in England or Ireland (yes, I've been to many). It was surreal to walk out of the pub and back in to Vegas... I was half expecting to step out onto a street in Ireland.  BTW the Lamb and Rosemary burger was to die for and the Guinness was poured perfectly.",

    "text": "Fantastic, late-night Irish pub food. Great alternative to Nine Fine Irishmen; Nine Fine can be a bit overdone and definitely touristy (read: not my fav), though their food is all right.  Ri Ra features an extensive menu of Irish and some American favorites. I wanted to order about a half-dozen things off the menu. Bangers and mash. Lamb stew. Fish and chips. Went with the fish and chips and shared with the hubby--it was plenty. It's a huge slab of fish covered with light-as-air beer batter. OM NOM NOM.  The soda bread--I know it's supposed to be dense and dry--was just a little too dense and dry, though once slathered in KERRYGOLD (!!!) butter pats and dipped in soup, it's perfection. So, toss-up there. I asked for an extra serving of it, so there you go.  The most memorable thing was actually my dad's lamb stew, and also their potato leek soup, of all things. The former was rich, flavorful, authentic, and lick-the-bowl good, and the latter was silky, smooth, and had ideal flavor. Win.  Drawback was trying to find gluten-free food for my mom, who has celiac disease (read: gluten ALLERGY, not diet). They were willing and able, however, to prepare her a steak in a clean pan so she wouldn't get sick, so kudos for that. It's also mega-noisy. But hey, it's a pub. Go and enjoy. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon just in time to catch the last part of the morning football games, and I was happy there were plenty of televisions throughout the restaurant. Although the atmosphere was fun and inviting, the food was not very good.  My wife and I opted to go with their special of the day- a shepherd's pie that featured prime rib pieces throughout and a gravy made with Guinness beer. Sounds good -right?  Who doesn't like prime rib and beer?   Um, no. We were served a bowl of slop with a bite or two of prime rib fat. Gross! The meal wasn't good, and the fake accents were worse. Seriously?   I would comeback to this place for beer and football. However, I'll make sure I eat somewhere else first.",

If your stuck on the strip and getting tired of the standard \"we barely tolerate you unless you're flashing a fat wallet\" attitudes, this was a great place to go. The brunch and lunch menu was large and varied enough for everyone in my group to find a good option.   The full Irish breakfast was a real experience, as it should be. Not everyday you get 4 kinds of meat for breakfast, and none of them are bacon. Also tried some of the Irish coffee and a few bites of fish and chips - which were both excellent, save for the chips which were a bit undercooked and soggy (maybe that's the style?).   Staff were exceptionally nice, showed up when we needed them and left us alone otherwise.  Good was quick, ready in under 15 minutes with a full house.   Decor is unique and cool, apparently most of the wood was taken from a \"real\" Irish pub. True or not, it's got a nice feel to it.",

We started drinking some more and met up with these two girls who said they were dental hygienists at a conference at the Luxor. After having them flash us at the bar, Kris goes to the room.  So its just me and my little brother Lyle. We ended up drinking some and partying. Lyle puked in a a garbage can among other things. Then it was time to decide what was going to happen late night. Turns out these two girls are both teachers 28 and 31. The 31 year old asked me to walk her back, where she slammed the door in my face #strikeout. As I am walking back to Lyle and my room, i open the door and see Lyle making out with the 28 year old the hallway buffet. I just laughed went to bed, my flight was at 8 am. When I go to leave (3 hours later) Lyle is playing blackjack and is up $500. Gotta love Vegas!",

This is not straight out of the microwave pub/tavern food, the meals here are serious. My husband and I shared the Kings cut prime rib, it was the biggest cut of rare meat I have ever been served, and it was so tender I was able cut it with a butter knife. It was absolutely decedent. Also, the fish and chips was amazing. Not a pile of fish sticks but a lightly battered and gently fried fillet of premium fish, it was delicious. The bartenders we met were actually from Ireland so the conversation was interesting and they often have live music.

I did not review this place before eating there because I was invited as a guest. I am writing this review because it was that BAD. The waiter was obnoxious and blamed the slow food service on the kitchen and the slow drink service on the bar. One of the people at the table ordered Shepperd's Pie and when informed the had none he said I really wanted Shepperd's pie, the waiter said well I really want to be off right now so what. It was lunch time and it took 2 hours to get drinks and lunch. Plus the place was dead. I had the Reuben and was looking forward to a good one. This was absolutely the worst Reuben I have ever had. So, Poor Service, Poor Food, I would give this place a zero star if it was available. I want to update this review. I gave it one star originally and within 2 hours of posting my review the manager contacted me to ask who our server was and to apologize. This speaks volumes to caring about his business. So I am adding a star. I will return next year to take him up on his offer of seeing that my first experience was the exception not the rule. Being a business owner myself I realize that sometimes a rogue employee can ruin the customer experience and that it is not necessarily the rule of the business itself.",

The food is very nice, large portions and good quality ingredients! The only issue we had was a very long wait from the time we ordered to actually getting our food. With our 4 kids in tow we watched others around us come after we did and get their food beforehand, but even with that small problem I think they are very worthy of 4 stars. Definitely a little treasure in a Vegas Hotel!!!",

The mashed potatoes are easily the best I've ever had and the salad was very good, too.  My husband and I shared the Guinness Sundae for dessert which was the BEST DESSERT ever.  It's like a blondie and brownie with Guinness chocolate sauce, strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  The next day for lunch, we skipped out on Burger Bar (our usual) and came back to Ri Ra instead.  I had the Ruben.  Best ruben by far I've ever had (and I'm not a big fan of corned beef usually).  It was awesome... I especially liked there were no huge chunks of fat hiding out in it.  Highly recommend this place! I'll be coming back every Vegas trip... just like for Mesa Grill...",

The bartenders are very friendly and skilled and can pull a first-class pint of Guinness. The food is tasty, well-prepared and a good value for the price point. The Irish breakfast in particular is a brilliant way to start the day after a heavy night out! The bronze statue of St Patrick is a funny and cool touch also. Anytime I'm in the vicinity, Ri Ra is a must-visit. If you are looking for a little piece of Ireland in the heart of Las Vegas, then it doesn't get any better than this. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "One of our best stops while in Vegas was Ri Ra's!   My husband being Scottish, we were looking forward to this authentic Irish pub with some food/drink items we are accustom to.  Tim, our waiter, from London was so much fun and actually spent a lot of time with us while continuing to serve multiple tables.   I had the fish & chips (of course!) and John enjoyed the curry and chips.   While John went for a traditional Kilkenny, I was on course again looking for that perfect appletini.   The Brits & Irish being much more keen on drink perfection, Tim was glad to see to it that I received a proper appletini.  And, it was oh so good!   This place is a must visit if you like the feel and friendliness of a proper pub.   This one was built in Ireland, shipped in pieces to the US and reassembled at it's final location at the Mandalay Bay shops.  Check it out - enjoy the real deal in food, drink and people.  OK...... Tim is from London, married to a Las Vegas gal, but he's still British all the way.   Most staff working at Ri Ra are Irish, British, even Australian, here to serve you on a 12 month visa.  They also have a live band every evening, 7 days a week.  Love you Ri Ra!  We will definitely stop by again next time we are in town.  The Galbraiths",

The menu includes a lot of traditional Irish items as well as more Americanized offerings to appeal to the masses.  I tried the fish and chips.  As soon as the server placed my meal in front of me, I could see the grease.  The fish was placed on top of the fries.  When I removed the fish, you could see oil on top of the already oily fries.  I could also see a pool of oil under the fries as well.  The fish tasted good, but also seemed a little bland.  It definitely needed tartar sauce.  The fries had great flavor, but were so greasy, they became soggy right away.  I expected better from a place that bills itself as an authentic Irish pub.  Portions were good.  I ordered the smaller portion of fish, which was more than enough for lunch and even dinner.",

The atmosphere is fun and the people that work there are actually Irish, our first visit consisted of drinks only in the front bar. They have a great extensive selection of beers and our most recent visit we got to try a few food items....the fish n chips is great, a huge portion! I got the mac n cheese but put my own spin on it adding bacon & bangers  which was good not the best but good. my husband enjoyed his rueben sandwich and their crab cakes were decent.I just love coming here! always feels like there's so much to look at around the place, the music is awesome, and I cant help but always leave feeling gooooooood from all the drinks and laughs. Great spot to hang with friends and in our case make one.",

The moment we took a tour of Ri Ra we knew we wanted our reception here because the decor and vibe was what we'd been searching for. We quickly met with their staff who were extremely accommodating, welcoming and determined to make our vision come True. We live in California so we had to plan over emails and phone calls, but the managers made us feel 100% confident that our wedding would be what we wanted because they were sooo organized! They made us feel like it would be amazing, and it was!!! Throughout the planning process, we worked closely with Paula, the manager, who was extraordinary! She was well organized, enthusiastic, helpful, answered emails quickly and genuinely cared about all my questions. I actually felt relaxed because I knew the details were in good hands (which isn't easy for the bride!) During our reception, all the staff was attentive, no one waited for drinks, food was delicious (she even made sure our Vegan guests, kids, and dietary restrictions were taken care of!), and we had the most amazing time ever! We want to thank RiRa, Paula and Scott for all their time, hard work, and fantastic implementation skills that helped give us a memory we'll forever cherish!!!",

You could buy a bag that would last you 2 months for 5.00 at Costco. Waitress  shorted us the change. It was not much, but it was mine! Tried the Guinness stew and the shepards pie. Really good!  So the food was really good, but I felt like  they were penny pinching on cheap things. If you are hungry, go!  However, I'd get drinks and appetizers elsewhere.",

    "text": "So me and two of my friends were walking around the Mandalay Shops tonight and we ended up at this place cuz the music was kinda fun. So they didn't had any tables available and we ended up seating with this bunch of people just to watch the band playing and have some shots. We only got 6 shots ($10 each) and one beer. The shots were kinda small compared to what u usually get everywhere in Vegas but why not right? So everything was alright until the check came. For some reason it had 20% gratuity already included so we were like \"wow thats really sneaky\" (let me just state the fact that me and my friends are servers in one of the casinos so we know about gratuities) So when we asked the server she said that the gratuity was included cuz we were a party of 6 or more. At that point we were really confused cuz we clearly stated when she first took our order that we didnt knew this people and the checks were separated. So, of course, she brings the manager just to tell us the same story. That they COULD NOT remove the gratuity which is a LIE and a violation of the gratuity law in Las Vegas. I understand that every place wants to make revenue but if your gonna stiff your guests and make them feel uncomfortable you should take your bussiness some place else. Its a shame such a cute little place ruined with that greedy staff. So if you ever pass by just make sure you get your drinks at the bar and pay as you go, at least no one will ruin your night!",

I was pleasantly surprised by the menu and the atmosphere. I ordered the lamb burger, which was so tasty and a great example of what an Irish gastropub would serve. I saw another table order the fish and chips, and it looked yummy. Also liked the sound of the Irish breakfast. Was on a work lunch, and would like to try it out at night.

    "text": "In the land of The Strip, authenticity is about as outlandish an expectation as winning a bajillion dollars at the roulette table. This is the main tourist drag in Las Vegas. Just about everything is over the top, overpriced, and nothing like its humble ancestors. Take the major bill magician shows. Back in the old days, instead of paying a few hundred bucks to watch a dude disappear a scantily-clad lady, we just stoned the magicians to death! Free of charge! Presto!  So I didn't anticipate finding a genuine pub in the midst of all the neon fakery. But I found one in Ri Ra, which is located in the least likely of places - the middle of a shopping mall at the Mandalay Bay resort. Believe it or not, Ri Ra isn't just an approximation of what an Irish pub might resemble. It serves lots of beer and whiskey as well as very tasty pub food - albeit, at Vegas prices - and many of the servers have lovely Irish accents. The staff was far and away the most attentive I encountered in my recent work trip to Vegas, possibly the nicest I remember based on a handful of trips to the city. And they didn't need a leprechaun who picked fights with fellows of English descent to keep me charmed, though I hear that's Criss Angel's new act.  Really, all I need for a solo meal in a pub is a cold pint, a plate of something delicious, and some decent reading material. One of the servers even asked me what I was studying so closely on my phone, and we chatted about figure skating. Charming, I tell you! It helped that the mac and cheese had just the perfect bread crumbs-to-cheese-to-noodles ratio. It was so good I ordered it on multiple visits. I know it's no shepherd's pie or fish and chips. I also know what I like, so screw you and the horse you rode in on and trust me just eat it. Even if UK pub food is not your jam, if you want a time-out from the surrealism of The Strip without renting a vehicle, you'll want to pass an hour or two here.",

The full serving of fish and chips came with the fish being a fileted fish longer than the plate. It melted in my mouth. the flavor very good and light. The beef and Guinness stew with Irish soda bread was tender and flavorful. After David serving us, our favorite thing is the St. Patrick holding a staff and a glass of Guinness.

The food, the music, the bartenders, and the ambiance. When you walk in you almost feel as though you're in Ireland.  I love the way the pub is set up. It also has a 60's or 70's theme room area. It has all these cool posters of European bands from that era, and the furniture has a very mod feel to it. What's even better is some of the staff are from Ireland and I talked to a few who waited on us and they were really nice. I ordered the Guinness beer and it was like nothing I ever had before. It was so good. If you go here and get a beer, get the Guinness, you will not regret it. The bartender, Jr., even put an imprint of a three leaf clover on the head of my beer. How cool is that?  We came back later and Fitzy was our late night bartender and he was very nice as well. I was a little disappointed that we had come too late since we had missed the evening dinner. I was looking forward to trying the prime rib and/or the Shepard's pie and sausages and mash but we settled for the fish and chips and sausage rolls which wasn't too bad at all to settle for. It was really good! But that's okay because it just gives me an excuse to come back here again. Overall a great experience!",

I got cramps after though so I know the food was off because we were totally fine before dinner.  Wife - Soup (was green, split pea? I dont recall) - got cramps and worse immediately after dinner that resulted in her running back to the room. Very bad.  Friends wife - she ordered risotto and it came gummy and funky. Definately not cooked to order. Sent back to kitchen. She shared her husbands fish which I guess was ok.  Friend - Fish and chips. Seems like the only one to get a relatively safe meal. I guess the deep fryer kills the salmonella or whatever was getting us all sick.  Over all for being in the Mandalay, this place is in serious need of a food inspection. That we got sick eating here is BAD.   Not recommended ever. Maybe beers. Service was ok, but way too damn loud for a small irish band (coming from a guy who plays in bands no less) in a small space. it was uncomfortable and just kinda lame.",

The table started to become a bit crowded when our individual full sized teapots (for 8 people) began to arrive. The sandwiches and desserts accompanying tea were nice but it would have been nice if we could have personalized our selections a bit and weren't just brought what was standard. I found the incredibly limited tea menu a bit odd. Excellent staff, an experience I would be willing to try again, maybe just not with 8 of us.",

Our waiter's recommendations were spot on. (Heads up, the online menu doesn't look to be up to date.)  We had the deviled scotch eggs as an appetizer and they were melt in your mouth amazing! We followed that up with Icelandic halibut fish and chips. The fish was so creamy that for the first time ever, I completely forgot to use tartar sauce. Every single person we dealt with was super friendly. I cannot wait to go back and I can't recommend this place high enough! Go Go Go! ... The beer is super tasty too with lots of draft options.",

This gem is located in the Mandalay Bay shopping area (between Mandaylay Bay and Luxor).    My most recent visit (1/12/17) I decided to try their Mac and cheese for the first time! Yet again, I was blown away.  The portion size didn't look big enough, (I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach) but it was just the right amount of richness to satisfy me! I am never disappointed when I eat (and drink) here.  The service is always good and the atmosphere is entertaining and fun.",

I ordered the special which was a blackened salmon salad, I loved it minus the fact the salmon was already chopped up. My friends ordered the fish and chips and loved it as well. There was a drink that had some pepper syrup , I didn't know how it tasted so my waiter offered to bring me a sample! That's customer service!

The potato cakes were nicely complimented by the sour cream and balsamic drizzle. The Scotch eggs are always delectable. The fish was perfectly cooked and not too greasy. The Brussels sprouts are so addictive - sauteed with enough bacon that you get some in every bite. I could honestly go there every day just for the Brussels sprouts!  And the service is always excellent. Knowledgeable staff who are always welcoming.",

It was pretty standard pub fare and was pretty good overall! Nothing to call home about, but nothing to complain about either. I'd go back and try what they have to offer outside the catered setting.",

Always heard the Irish place was good. It was not super busy either night but they had live music, two guys singing and playing guitar. They were awesome, very energetic and lively.   The food and service is what makes this place. The ambiance is dark and the vibe is cool...plus the whiskey wall is awesome! If you can't have fun at a place with live Irish music and whiskey everywhere...well.. I can't hang out with you. LOL  I ordered the veggie burger on 12-30 which came with goat cheese. See my pics, it's hard to describe. It was definitely homemade veg burger and it was really good. We came back on NYE for dinner and I couldn't resist ordering the salmon. It was out of this world, melt in your mouth amazing. I think it came with some sort of crisp potatoes, I inhaled it so fast. Perfect amount of food and wasn't horribly priced, I think maybe it was a $22 entree. It was New Year's Eve so I splurged. :) That and a Makers Mark mmm mmm mmm!  Service is always fast and friendly. As a local I can appreciate a place on the strip that doesn't gorge you on prices and you can afford more than two drinks. We will be back for sure!",

However, as the very welcoming hostess maneuvers you through to get to your table, it will seem like a different world,  away from the Vegas strip, stimulating lights, and casino sounds.  You've step into a cozy, friendly,  happy, and dare i say almost homely environment. Football (soccer) game was displayed on the large screen.  Still cozy because it's set up so tables are close enough but not too close,  just enough to have conversations without yelling despite the game in the background. There's even a living room-like area with sofas and books and a simulated fireplace.  The darling small center stage was set up for musicians was empty at the time but one can only imagine the vibe once its taken over.  Once seated you'll be enthralled by the decor and the encased bottles of alcohol in glass cabinets that acts as the walls from ceiling to bottom.  There are also more inviting rooms in the back!  The servers were on top of everything and supper efficient.  The breakfast food was delicious...rashes (bacon) and bangers (sausages) was yumsters!  Had the Irish Benedict. You can order your beans on the side too.  Loved this pub.",

    "text": "It feels great to finally remove Ri Ra from my bookmarks list.  Let me explain:  Back when I started actively Yelping a little over a year ago, I saw someone review this place, and when I checked the menu, I saw an item that I HAD to try:  Irish Benedict.  Eggs Benedict on potato pancakes instead of an English Muffin?  You had me at \"Potato.\"  Yesterday, we were celebrating my dear friend's birthday, and my completion of a pretty intensive diet and exercise program, so for a treat, we came to Ri Ra.  I'm really angry that I waited so long, but at the same time, it was worth the wait.   The pub is easy to find in Mandalay Place, and has a very cozy feel to it.  Like so many Irish pubs, its a bit on the darker side, with dark wood tables, bars, and chairs.  There is a stage for live music, and they have several rooms, with TVs and projector screens so that people can watch games or matches.    Our server, Victoria, was a treasure.   She was friendly, offered recommendations, and answered our MANY questions about the menu, and the Scotches.  She offered us extra soda bread, and even continued to take care of us when we asked to take our Scotch flights in their parlor room, when that wasn't her section.  Speaking of Scotch! They have a whole wall full of Scotch and Whiskey.  I was in heaven.  SO many good ones too!!!  They have some pretty amazing flight deals, which I will touch on later.  So now, onto the food.  We ordered the following: The Potato and Leek soup with bacon and Irish Cheddar, served with soda bread:  THIS was delicious.  I can't say I've ever had a leek soup before, and I just loved this.  Sadly, I didn't order it, my fella did, but he loves me, so he shared.    Fish and Chips:  Two of the three manly men at our table ordered the small fish and chips...and it wasn't exactly small!  We'd heard amazing things about the fish and chips here, even that it was better than another Irish Pub that we frequent, and so we had high expectations.  I don't know that I'd say that they were \"better\" but they were very different.  First, rather than a few small pieces of fish, for the \"small\" portion, they give you a HUGE fillet of battered fish!  Let me say it again...HUGE!  The batter had a nice crunch to it, and for me, was very light.  My fella said it was a touch greasy towards the middle, but also said that he enjoyed the way the batter soaked up the malt vinegar and salt.   The chips were pretty standard:  could have been a touch more crisp, but they were very good.  The Kilcullen omelette: The only issue with this one was that it was overwhelming mushroom flavored.  It was still good, but I think we could have done without so many mushrooms, and a bit more corned beef.  Finally, the Irish Benedict:  Let me tell you, this was 150% worth the wait.   The potato pancakes were thick and rich, with a thin rasher (Irish bacon), and a poached egg, smothered in hollandaise...and there were two!  This was almost too much food, since it also came with a side of beautifully spiced potatoes, and a grilled tomato.  The rasher was delicious, and while the eggs were overcooked just a touch (the yolk was just a little more solid than a poached egg should be), I am not going to nitpick about that, because the flavor was delicious, and my friend prefers her eggs this way, so they were perfect for her.    After our meal, the gentlemen decided to take their Scotch flights to the \"Parlor Room\" which has couches, another little bar, and really cute decoration.   The Scotch flight that my fella got has to be the best deal I've seen for a flight... 3 FULL CASK strength scotches, and really good quality scotch too...for $20.  To put this in perspective, the Laphroaig full cask was $14 for a dram on its own...so for $6 extra, we got 2 additional great Scotches.  My favorite was the Aberlour.  So smooth!  Prices were really not too bad, especially for being on the Strip, and they do have an email club that gives you coupons, etc.  I received a $5 off coupon just for signing up (although it took a day or two to come through in my e-mail.)  The hostess let us know too, that they offer a locals discount on Fridays, which sounds pretty incredible.  I'm already planning my next visit!  I think the shepherd's pie might be next to try.",

Also great place to watch European soccer although I wish they would turn the sound up since it is a pub after all;  my only minor gripe.",

When we came back, they were now on their dinner menu. The prices definitely took a jump up! I would have rather gone for lunch because I didn't care for their dinner options. The lunch sandwiches sounded really good to me but I ended up settling for a burger for dinner. It was just ok. A little under-cooked in my opinion, but the bun was very good. Not worth the money because it didn't even come with a side. Also, the service sucked. Didn't even get a refill on (pricey) sodas. From what I could tell, most of the staff must be from Ireland and the dishes were traditionally Irish. The restaurant is actually pretty large and definitely had an Irish feel which was nice. They have live music but unfortunately it doesn't start until late.",

The venue is well appointed with fine carved wood and carvings that according to staff were taken from closed churches in Ireland.   Their are a number of great things about the Ri Ra including the best Guinness Beer in Vegas, a great Irish atmosphere which is augmented by well tuned bands playing traditional Irish music with a modern flair.   Also, the hours are Awesome, as they are open for breakfast and their doors don't shutter until the wee hours of the morning.    The only negative about the Ri Ra is the food and I have sampled enough to \"Tap Out\".   I have had their Shepherds Pie, which is made with lamb (thus the moniker Shepherd) which was tasteless and dry. Their pub fries are limp and oily with no taste, a description that fits their sausage, scones, wings, and burgers and everything we have had on the menu.  The only redeeming item was the Breakfast Tea which my spouse loved.   In conclusion, I will continue to visit for the beer, atmosphere and music, but will eat elsewhere.",

The overall experience of Ri Ra was exhausting despite the four star reviews. The ticket time was dreadful for starters while watching multiple servers pace back an forward with looks of confusion delivering food. Perhaps their table numbering system is off.     I ended up inquiring with management about our food after waiting an unreasonable length of time (moments before it arrived). The restaurant wasn't busy on the front end at all.  My \"not so lucky\" white bean veggie burger $12 was absolutely disgusting! I literally left it on the table. This homemade patty texture was terrible and the flavor was even worse.  My friend ordered the fish & chips $20. This whole filet of Icelandic haddock was massive! The taste was decent; no outstanding bold beer battered flavor to rave about. I did end up sharing the dish due to the generous portion (definitely shareable depending on your appetite). The fries (or chips) were soggy and blah just like the onion rings $6.   $40+tip This unlucky patron will not be returning!",

    "text": "We were passing through and thought we would give this place a try and we were not disappointed! My kids had fish and chips which was more than enough and if they were younger (they are 10 &14) they could of shared, neither finished the children's portion and they both loved it. My husband had the Shepard's pie, it looked amazing. He said it was awesome and the lamb was really tender. My picky 14 yr old even took a bite and thought it was great. However, I'm convinced my entree was the best. I had the beef & Guiness stew. O.M.G. It was amazing. The scoop of mashed potatoes in the middle made it, the meat was tender and it was seriously the best Stew I have ever had. Again my 14 yr old thought it was amazing and said he is getting that next time, even though he was pleased with the fish. Portion wise I did not finish the stew, I don't think it would be quite big enough to share but it's not ridiculous either, I would let me son order it (yes he is 14 and ordered off the kids but he is small and really doesn't eat enough to order off the big menu most of the time) because it wasn't overwhelmingly big.   The service was great, the ambience is very cool typical of Irish pubs.   Even though it's a bit pricey, it was well worth it. We would definitely go again.",

She was very on top of it and got our orders in quickly. When her shift ended she introduced us to our new waiter. He seemed friendly but our service dropped off tremendously with the switch. When we were done and asked for the check it was probably 10 minutes before he brought it and and 20 minutes till he finally cashed us out and brought it back to us. We had split the check (3 ways) there were some errors but since he was so slow we settled the difference between ourselves.  The upside is my glass had a crack in it which I hadn't noticed till near the end, when  a different server noticed it she came over and asked if it was cracked, then took it away and brought me a brand new drink!",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I KNOW MY IRISH BARS AND FOOD. I was born and raised in that magical country and I frequently return for lengthy visits. Ireland is my favorite place in the world.   And now, Ri Ra is my favorite Irish pub in the world that exists outside of Ireland. It is authentic and decorated perfectly. The rich, dark wood and the paintings and the lighting and even the Irish accents of some of the servers could not be more perfect. Walking into Ri Ra is like walking into one of the local Temple Bar watering holes in Dublin.   Ri Ra has an absolutely astounding selection of beer and cider - the best of what Ireland and England have to offer and in my opinion, more of a selection than any other Irish pub in town. (HELLO! MAGNERS/BULMERS ON DRAFT!!!) Also, they've got a great whiskey list and flight samples that rival even the Freakin Frog's attic!   We ordered the fish and chips to share and the sausage rolls as an appetizer. Sausage rolls are one of my favorite comfort foods, so I was really hoping Ri Ra came through with this one. And, THEY DID. The sausage rolls were perfect and tasty and crunchy yet soft - probably the best I have ever had. When our fish and chips came out, I knew I was in love before I even took the first bite because I could tell that these were freshly cut potatoes and a really great cut of fish - HUGE too.   Without a doubt in my mind, Ri Ra has the best fish and chips in Vegas - definitely the best I have had outside of Ireland.   They've also got a pretty awesome \"late night chipper\" menu that I can't wait to check out. If you visit the bar for a drink, they've got all the bar snacks you'd find in Ireland - Tayto or King crisps, chocolate, etc. You name it!   This place is amazing. Although it might be a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service! If this bar was closer to my house and not located on the strip, I'd probably never leave.",

I would suggest the tender and flavorful prime rib.",

It was also loaded with potatoes.  The fish n chips were excellent, a huge portion and I ordered the half or lunch portion.  The chips were a little on the greasy side, but the fish was nice and flakey and battered well.  Price was great for the portion.",

It really does allow for the feel of an old Irish pub.  Food: I love wings- and these ones were good. We had the honey BBQ which had just enough sweetness to be delicious. We also had the sausage pastry rolls-- how have I never tried these before? It's like beef Wellington but with sausage and extra phyllo dough. Just delicious. I'm proud of us we restrained from ordering round two of them.  Drinks: Typical beer and wine fare.. And seem to have some happy hour specials that vary by day.",

The moment you walk in, the immense wood filled bar strikes your vision - statutes, old pictures, and that fabulous old wood imported from Green Ireland.  Its undeniable pretty.  And the fact that you can also order decent food, and a good beer - simply adds to the grandeur.  Our server seemed to be from Ireland.  Or at least had a plenty good fake accent.  Either way, they score cool points for that.  It's a large place, with many rooms tucked inside the long rectangular design.  It seems like it would be a great place to hang out for a night with a large group, or to catch some rugby games.  Las Vegas is anything but Ireland.  It's anything from green, and anything from old like the motherland.  But at Ri Ra, for a moment, if you pretend and you've ordered enough glasses, you just might feel like you're there.  Or almost.  And that's enough.",

The singer was shouting out his songs and beating up his poor guitar in a very tiresome way.   Apart from this we felt somewhat unattached in our corner.  The personnel were very nice and helpful, giving quick and good service. The dinner was also tasteful and good. I had The Kilcooly and I really liked it!  A strange thing, after eating we asked for toothpicks and the answer was:- I know this sounds crazy, but we don't have it...  3 stars from me this time, because 4 is too much after this visit, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get a 4 star experience if we go there again, the potential is certainly there.",

Our server was Irish, which I found interesting that she would want to work at an Irish inspired restaurant. She pointed us to the avocado toast, fish and chips, and shepherds pie. Each was unique and tasty. The fish piece was enormous, flaky, and had a great light batter. The shepherds pie was made of lamb, not my favorite protein, but it was good even though I felt it was small for the price. The toast had capers, goat cheese, avocado and pickled onions, it was a bit on the salty side for me, but still good. I did enjoy the complimentary soda bread. I can't say anything to the authenticity of the place, I don't know much about Irish food, but what I had was tasty. Service was, for the most part, efficient. I'd recommend trying it once and going with a group so you can share dishes.",

    "text": "This place has a very welcoming feel, which is refreshing for a restaurant in a casino. We walked in and did a lap before choosing from a few of the open spaces at one of the bars. Yes ONE OF the bars i counted four in total, each in a different area of the restaurant, and each area provided a bit of a different atmosphere. Once settled on or stools, with some assistance from our friendly bartender for the evening (whom had already made his tip by my meassure just for his jersey he was wearing. Go Skins!). Wally, i believe was his name, came back around the bar introduced himself, guided us through the menu, suggested a few of his favorites, and gave us some time to think it all over. Once we reach decisions he was right there we went with a few of his suggestions i had the dark and stormy cocktail which combined two of my fav things rum and ginger beer. We started with the crab cakes which i only agreed to because Wally said he had lived on the east coast and we are from there (picky marylander about crabs). The boyfriend had the steak pie special for september, i had sausage and mash, both very very good didn't even need the sauces given/suggested with my sausage. The special was a little smaller thank expected but great  since the crab cakes and side salad would have been a perfect size meal. The live irish duo band was nice, giving something to tap your feet to while you dine. We sat a little to close to the stage to have any kind of steady conversation but that was ok since we were so into our meals. Overall a great place to go for a feel of good irish comfort and food.",

They have great staff, great beer, and fun live Irish music on most nights. Highly recommended for a wedding reception (and of course just to hang out). Coming from California, we depended on a manager, Paula, to make it a hit. We used their house DJ, Stephen, and ordered an array of party trays and appetizers to serve buffet style. We had 50 people and it was perfect for their Theater Room, which was reserved just for us, with our own bar and restrooms! I dropped off our candy and jars for a candy buffet and left it to Paula to put together how she wished while we were at our ceremony. She did an amazing job! I can not express how wonderful our reception turned out. I hope Ri Ra stays there forever. Our friends had a great time there also and kept going back throughout the weekend. By the way, the food is excellent! Irish potato cakes and fish and chips were our favorite.",

After 15 minutes without seeing a server I approached the bar to order beers for the 3 of us at our table. I was cut off by a waiter and told to return to my table and give my order to my server. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  We finally get a waitress who is obviously irritated to have gotten our table and she says 2 sentences to us. \"You guys need some beers?  Great, how bout food?\"  20 more minutes go by and we still haven't received even water or seen our server again. This is now 40 minutes sitting at an empty table. We finally make the decision to leave and the hostess that was so rude follows us to Hussongs and begins adamently telling us that we need to go back and wait. And that we \"can't just leave.\"  Again, are you kidding me?  I've worked as a server and bartender for 13 years. My girlfriend and I are locals and we were trying to show a friend from out of town a good time on her first night here. Thanks for making sure we couldn't do that Ri Ra. Bravo.",

I ordered the Traditional Irish Breakfast, it was very good, cooked well, yummy mushrooms and black and white pudding, which I've never had but wasn't bad, It went well with the yolk form my eggs.  My boyfriend loved the Black Sausage especially.  He ordered a corn beef sandwich which I saw get delivered but he ate it so fast I didn't see it after that.  They had great choices on beer and I had a Irish Coffee that was excellent, the best I ever had, the right touch of everything, in a cute glass too, if we were at a local bar I woulda swiped it, lol.

But, moreso the service was exceptional and the most friendly of anywhere we went in the city. We were so disappointed other places we came back for a second dinner here. It made me proud of my heritage. The staff was as nice as any restaraunt I have ever been. The corned beef and cabbage and the fish and chips were spectacular! After, debacles at two other restaraunts due to poor service or lackluster food at high prices we found this place and would love to go to any of the ones located on the east coast especially the ones in Maine and New Hampshire. Thanks, for being a really bright light for us in a city of supposed bright lights. John E. Wood P.S. I read one of the other reviews and it referred to a gyro. I do not believe they serve them at the Ri Ra but, if they did why would ordera gyro at an Irish Pub. Also, I thought the Nine Fine Irishmen place at New York, New York was horrible so I am not just looking to promote Irish places!",

Also great to see the old school prawn cocktail and the Chips and malt mayo was tasty. Guinness wings was very tasty. Enjoyed the salad with smoked salmon and Rasher. Guest had the Irish stew and was very tasty as well. The biggest plus of this place is the beer menu, I now have a favorite beer, It's the Innis & Gunn oak aged barrel beer. This was absolutely delicious! Ambiance was old school Ireland and I felt like I was there. Maith thu Ri Ra!",

    "text": "Tourists rule this pub, but sometimes tourists can be fun too. This place is great because we don't get the \"typical\" Vegas bartender and wait staff. Nearly everybody is flown in from the mother country and our waiter had a strong Irish accent and was very nice in that Irish kind of way, even calling us \"boys\". Other strange things I encountered here were a Rasher, which was described as Irish bacon and a relish called ballytime which was sort of sweet, but basically a red relish. Both of those items landed on my $10.95 1/2 pound burger which included Irish Cheddar as well. Burger was cooked to perfection (I only eat them well done) and seemed to be just as good as Burger bar next door. My buddy ordered the fish and chips and proclaimed them to be the best ever. They included a free salad also. Our appetizer was an unusual one called Baked Goat Cheese. Basically a small bowl of melted and baked goat cheese with piles of chopped walnuts and two other Irish things you throw on some toasted flat bread. It's decent, but you don't need to order it and also skip the onion rings, which were just greasy onion strings. The fries were much better. They always have at least two $4 beers on tap (yesterday was two kinds of Irish shandy) and a very entertaining two-person Irish band was cranking out tunes as early as 9pm. Locals are like unicorns here, but this is one place where prices, service and food are reasonable enough to venture to the strip..at least for me.",

They have high top seats and a stage usually with some Irish folk singer playing. TV's everywhere for the sports fans out there. The staff is friendly and awesome. I didn't mind the price, it's Vegas so everything is gonna cost extra. Only thing I have to comment on was the brisket was extremely fatty and gnarly. I didn't eat most of it. The wings are amazing and most everything else on the menu is good. Always have a great time going here.",

We were seated within a couple steps of the front door. Come to realize, this is a fairly large restaurant. (After the multiple rooms and hallways scouring for the restroom.)   Ordering coffee, juice, omelette and  single pancake. Coffee came in carafe which is always nice. But was presented with a 100% used mug. Literally coffee stains inside and out. After apologies were made, we received our food. Nothing spectacular, but cleaver gimmicks. Corn-beef veggie omelette. Really i knew what I was walking into with this place. But the pankcake was gritty and fell apart with every touch of the fork.   The worst pancake I've ever had.   I'm sure this restaurant has a time and a place for it. But catching a quick breakfast is NOT one of those moments. Maybe a pint and some bad accents. Thanks but no thanks.",

For our wedding anniversary, we bought tickets for Cirque's One (we were married the day the King of Pop died) and decide to try Ri Ra Irish pub in Mandalay Bay.   Friday night at 5 is early by Vegas standards, so we were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. Knowing we wouldn't be able to take anything with us, we passed on the appetizers. For main courses, my wife ordered their Ruben with a side of Brussel Sprouts and I ordered the Steak and Chips, medium well. When the food came, we were not disappointed. My wife raved about her sandwich and her side. I enjoyed my steak and fries; there are better steak houses in the city but I realize I was in a pub so it did the job quite nicely.   The best part of all -locals take notice- is that Friday's locals receive 40% off food orders. They do card you, so visitors, sorry!  It made what was already going to be a reasonably priced meal even better! I would recommend Ri Ra if you are ever down in the Mandalay Bay area.",

    "text": "There are two things that will inspire someone to write a quick review. One is a great experience and the other a bad experience. Unfortunately, the latter applies here.   I guess I was using the reviews to scout out a nice casual place to host a business dinner. I was hosting mostly business associates who were young, hungry and thirsty so the thought of an Irish Pub near the hotel which was hosting our convention seemed appealing. That appeal quickly left us when the waitress assigned to us found better things to do than serve our table.   It started out nice with the waitress coming over, introducing herself and taking our beverage order as well as appetizers. We ordered the wrapped sausage, mussels and poutine. There were seven of us all having a good time. At no time should all eyes have been turning towards the waitress until 45 minutes later and our food was finished, drinks were gone and we were hungry and ready to order our main dish. We were watching as she hid behind an area where she was entering information into a computer. We went over to her to explain that we were ready to order and she explained that she was busy with the computer having issues and would be there shortly----Wrong Answer. There wasn't a manager, hostess or other server available to rescue her. Finally she came over to take our order and get our next round of beverages.   I had the sprout salad which was very good. The mussels, poutine and wrapped sausage were all very good hence the 2 star review. Unfortunately if you try to ruin an important business dining experience, the service plays a major role.   We were seated at 7:00 and finished closer to 9:00 just in time to hear the live entertainment. It was a memorable experience, but only from the negative side. They add 20% tip to all tables of 5 or more. In this case, they should have deducted 10%. They don't point out that the tip is already included unless you read carefully, but always leave room for an additional tip. I usually do, but not this time. I won't be going back here again. Sorry Ri Ra, I'm sure not all of your servers are this poor.",

The place was convenient since the convention was held at Mandalay Bay and I was staying at the Luxor and this happened to be at the walkway between the two ! :) I had a couple of the \"half and halfs\" here on the bartenders recommendation and really liked it. Also had the sausage wrap (think that's what it's called) appetizer and it was filling that I did not need dinner that night. Since this was all to be found in the happy hour, the total damage was about $20 which was very decent for a Vegas bar. But the place itself has a good Irish pub feel to it and I would gladly visit again on my next trip.",

For food we decided to share the sausage rolls as an app. I loved the flakey crust and the mustard sauce on top was very tasty too. For an entree I had the Ruben sandwich with a side of onion rings. I personally love shoe string onion rings so I was infatuated. The Ruben was very good too, probably the best I've ever had. My boo went with the Irish mac n cheese. It had a very unique flavor different from the usual which was quite delicious. We also decided to tempt ourselves more with the trinity dessert. I loooooved the flavors in it and it was more than enough for the two of us to share.  I can't wait to come back here and try some more Irish goodies.",

As another Yelper said in their review, you immediately forget you're in Vegas when you walk in the restaurant because of the atmosphere that they have. I've never been to Ireland but I felt like it was an authentic pub.   We were a big group and they were extremely accommodating with the bill. Their service was consistent and the waiter was very friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide what to get since there were a few options on the menu that I was deciding between, and he helped me out.  I KNOW the fish and chips are the hit here (and they did look really good!), but I'm not a huge fish and chips fan, so I went with the veggie burger because it was calling my name. It was so tasty! The patty was delicious itself; cooked leaving a soft inside and a crunchy outside. I got a brioche bun instead of the one it normally came with and I was happy with that sub. The goat cheese was mellow but flavorful, and I got the curry fries on the side (recommended by my waiter) that were unique and yummy.   They had good beers on tap, and the prices were reasonable for a Vegas pub. Glad I checked it out!",

They're trying hard to represent an Irish pub, but with the Cranberries crooning \"Zohohm-bee eeh eeh eeh \" on the speakers, and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish playing on TV, it's classic Vegas kitsch.   Service was fast. I ordered a Guinness stout (served colder than I like), the Burren Irish Smoked Salmon small plate and a Sprout Salad, then settled down to watch an obscure European soccer game.   The salad and salmon arrived simultaneously - I started with the former but it was too dry, though the dried cranberries and spicy cashews were a nice addition. I put it aside and turned to the Burren salmon.   The salmon was excellent - tender and succulent - but ratio of fish to sundries was way off. Too much pickled red onion, capers, and sour cream, not enough salmon. And the soda bread was way too thick and dry - they'd put store bought Kerrygold butter on top (of course!) which made me smile at the irony.   Overall a meh experience. Likely won't return, with so many other dining options to try out in Vegas. Cheers!",

The atmosphere and decor is very typical of pubs.   Let me begin by saying that they have the best scotch eggs I've ever had! The crust has just the right amount of crunchiness and perfectly seasoned sausage interior. I've also had their Mac and cheese on multiple occasions and never been disappointed. It did need some additional seasoning but pretty phenomenal overall. I tried their mashed potato cakes this time. Again, lacked some seasoning but had a very crispy exterior. They also make a mean Irish coffee. Pretty solid pub overall!",

    "text": "This review is for Ri Ra's afternoon tea, which they offer everyday from 11-4.  (Make sure to make a reservation at least 24 hours in advance.)  At less than $25 per person, it is one of the lowest-priced teas in town and comes with the usual: tea, sandwiches, scones, and desserts.    I've done their tea service twice now.  The sandwiches they offer are egg mayonnaise, cucumber and cream cheese, ham and tomato, and Irish cheddar and ballymaloe relish (tomato basically).  It was unanimous in my party that the cheddar and tomato relish was the least favorite and we had plenty of leftovers of that.  The scone was ok, definitely very filling (\"doughy\" is how one person in my party described it).  They offer only one of each dessert (per two people), including macaroons, cream puffs, and a jelly roll that no one particularly cared for.  Be prepared to fight for your favorite!  Or split it in half :p  As for the teas, I was wanting green tea on my most recent visit but they did not have any that day.  Instead, I got the Barry's Gold Blend which I enjoyed.  Service ranged from ok to very good on my visits.    There is definitely room for improvement with their afternoon tea, especially with some of the menu items, but overall it was ok and I'm glad that I got to experience something different from the more expensive tea services on the Strip.  I mean, tea in a pub? That alone is an experience!  *My pictures are from my visit in December 2015 as I didn't take many pictures on my most recent visit this month, and aside from some desserts, not much has changed since then.",

Our waiter Jack was really patient, helpful, and informative. He truly provided some of the best service during my stay in Vegas.   Go here!

The curried Chicken was exactly what I was looking for. Fresh chicken and bell peppers and half white rice and half fries. Super filling and left me satisfied. !   One of the best places to eat at the shoppes in Mandalay Bay.   If I was staying in Vegas longer I would come here and try every item because it is just that amazing!",

Oh, and the last 5 or so times we've visited, I've had the Corned Beef & Cabbage is ridiculous (in a good way).    Tonight was the first time we ordered an appetizer.

We were seated in the back of the pub which is huge. We had an Irish server who was awesome and explained everything in detail from the best on the menu from appetizers to entree's. I had the haddock fish n chips which was the bomb, a large portion but so damn good. My buddy had Shepard's pie which he loved. We had two pints of harp, great Irish beer. We were so full but still got desert snickerdoodle recommended by the server and it was amazing. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a True Irish feel and bonus having an authentic Irish server. Love this place and we will be back for sure.",

It was so good I ordered another one, it was called good for the goose for anyone who was wondering lol. She was alot slower getting a bottle of wine for two of my colleagues.

They had a live band playing the duration of our visit, but we decided to sit towards the back of the restaurant where it would be more quiet. The service was quite slow and it seemed to be because they were short staffed. Our waitress was very accommodating and helpful when she came by our table, but she was also flustered because she had to deal with multiple other tables that had large parties. The food was amazing! If you like salmon, you will absolutely love the Jameson Salmon! They also have a large selection of beers and wines. I would go back again. The atmosphere was very authentic and definitely didn't feel like you were in Vegas.",

For some reason, this is an attraction in itself. Perhaps it gives it a sense of authenticity, perhaps I've always fantasized about going to Ireland and meeting a red head, or perhaps it makes me feel they are alcohol experts by default, but no matter what the reason, I loved the accents.  CAUTION: Do not order the whiskey sampler for breakfast!!! The thing is described as three shots of various whiskeys for 8 dollars. I assumed since it was only 8 dollars, the shots must be 1/3 to 1/2 of a full shot. They were pretty much full shots. On top of this, I also ordered a Bushmills Honey shot, which was delicious.   4 shots for breakfast later, I ordered 2 pints of \"something red.\" I regret that I do not know the name of this beer, but it was also delicious. It was the beer on tap on the far left side of the bar that's closest to the bathroom at the time of writing.",

They've sectioned it in a way that it feels like a series of bars and not a huge warehouse of a restaurant and the decor is warm and welcoming - lots of wood just like a cool pub.   Service was as friendly and helpful as you could ever ask for. Nice enough that I may give them another chance sometime down the line but right now I still have the bitter taste of disappointment in my mouth from yesterday.   We started with the hot wings appetizer. They show up on a mini cookie tray. no problem. Not my style but I'm ok with it. The wings have a very good flavor but not as crispy or cooked thru as I would choose. Not bad enough to send back but made a mental note to ask for well done if I ever return. Both of us said they were \"not bad\".  My partner had a soup and salad lunch combo which was a caesar salad and potato leek soup. I ordered the pub burger with bacon and a cauliflower gratin side. I ordered the burger Med-rare, erring on the rare side. Our lunches arrive in good time and they are on plate size metal cookie sheets. My first thought was prison grub. My partners salad was as scattered on the tray as could be. It really looked like a handful of romain was tossed at the sheet and whatever hit was the portion. Even if we thought the metal trays were nice, and we don't, It could not have been plated sloppier. He said it tasted ok and the potato leet soup was ok too. I tried my burger and it was well done and desiccated. The waiter was nice, took it back and I had another burger promptly. Looking at the new burger it was obvious without even trying it that the patty was raw. I removed the top and the patty had the slightest grey color imaginable. It appeared that it spent about two seconds on a warm grill. I showed the manager and he was nice and apologetic. I was done with them. I asked him to remove it from my bill and to bring me the bill. He did. He also took it upon himself to give us a 40% discount on the rest of the bill. I appreciate that.   I'm torn if I'll go back. The menu looks good, has lots of things I could enjoy but they can't cook a burger that is on their menu, they don't care how the food looks and sending out the raw patty shows me they are happy to insult a customer. They either don't know how to hire staff or run a kitchen or just don't care. Maybe another time I'll try again but right now I'm still pissed at what poor, talentless, lack of concern we were shown from the kitchen.",

It was then time to make our order!  -Pub Wings: We started off with this delightful appetizer! It was covered with Guinness BBQ sauce and Jameson honey glaze alongside bleu cheese dip. The flavors mingled so well (Probably a little too well because I ate about 75 percent of the wings, and left my friend the remaining 25 percent, haha). So... Hoorah! -Turkey, Bacon & Bleu Melt: Me! This was my pick. It was really good, but a little dry. I had to dip it in my bleu cheese, but overall it was still a great sandwich. -Publicans Reuben: This was my friend's pick (Oh, I forgot to mention that we traded half of our sandwiches with each other so we got to taste the best of both worlds!) I cannot explain how great this sandwich was! It was ultimately the best reuben sandwich I've ever gotten to taste! I RECOMMEND THIS SANDWICH UNDOUBTEDLY!  During and after our meal, our server and busser came several times to check on us! (I believe their names were D and Fred, if I can recall). They were happy to grab us some more water, dressing, whatever the case was. This definitely made it such a positive experience! I loved all of the workers! They were all so kind and had plenty of beautiful smiles on their faces whenever they walked by.  Overall, the space was very cozy, the people were awesome, the food was yummy in my tummers, and I will most likely be returning for some bomb dot com reuben sandwiches and probably some BEER! Watch out for me! haha",

I love their fish and chips which is the best I ever had anywhere.  The atmosphere is always lively and fun, and they have live bands playing.

We had arranged to meet some friends there, a few of us were sat waiting for the others (with our first drink of the night), the manager came and asked us to move to another bar as he wanted to use our tables for people having food, we were just drinking and had been sat there by the waitress being clear we were just drinking.  So... We were basically being asked to leave the bar as we were only drinking and not eating. We said we were waiting for more people and wanted to finish our drinks (still the first drink, we had only just sat down), he said \"ok, don't bother\" stroppily and walked off. We tried to get another drink and were told by our waitress that the manager had told her not to serve us.  On asking the manager why we couldn't get another drink, he said that he didn't know anything about why she wouldn't serve us and suggested that maybe we were drunk. He threatened to call security.   It put quite downer on the start of our night, I would avoid this bar like the plague unless you want your night spoiled, go to any of the other live music venues in M Bay, the staff are a lot nicer!",

That's great for rock. Not as much for acoustic folk. I measured over 104 dB and most of that was distortion. Turn it down. Good acoustic music speaks for itself.",

Try to go on a Monday and check out John Windsor - he's incredible. We met Garrett who works there on our first night, and he was soooo awesome.

The balsamic reduction and sour cream matched perfectly with savory appetizer. I could not stop myself from eating the whole thing! As for the entrees they were both delicious too! The fish was so crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside, also the portion was huge! My bangers and smash had peas, potatoes, sausage, onion rings, and a slice of tomato. It was such a pleasant combination of textures and flavors put together. I also ordered a side of Caesar salad, but they had forgotten it so when we brought it up to our server I asked for it to-go, and he gave it to us free of charge. They service and food was excellent. I cannot wait to come back and try their other dishes.",

    "text": "With our friends visiting from Philly, we went to RiRa on a Friday night, when a great deal for locals - 40% off food - is offered.  One thing I love about Irish pubs is the decor - all dark wood and atmosphere.  I wasn't sure that an Irish pub at Mandalay Place would be authentic, but RiRa sure was: raucously loud, friendly, and, and hopping.  Our choice was to wait for a booth or try to have four of us eat at one of the tiny, high center pub tables with backless stools.  Luckily, a booth opened up not long after we tried to settle in at the pub table, and we changed over to a much more comfortable spot.  The waiter was great, despite the crowd and having to shout over the music that was way too loud.   We started with Irish potato cakes, delicious with the addition of a balsamic glaze. Two of us ordered the pork loin special, which differed a bit from the regular one on the menu, and it was terrific.  Hubby had the Guinness Beef Stew, which he loved, and one friend, looking at the Reuben sandwich at the next table, decided to go with the Corned Beef and Cabbage.  I tasted it and found it very bland.  IMO, when it comes to corned beef, there's only one kind of place to get it, and an Irish pub doesn't cut it for me.  We almost never order dessert, but since our friends always do, we didn't want to watch them and drool, so we did, too.  They got the blueberry crumble, which we would have gotten too, except it had an oat crumb topping.  I sowed my wild oats years ago, so we passed on that and went with the Kerry Apple Cake.  The apple cake turned out to sound better than it tasted, so I guess we should have gone blueberry.  I also ordered coffee.  They serve it in a French press, but the small one I ordered turned out to give me half a cup of coffee.  For me, an 80-oz a day coffee junkie, this was unacceptable!  The waiter, sweetheart that he was, brought me a gigantic French press, which the menu said serves 3-4, and it was just perfect!  Okay, so the music was too loud, and wasn't exactly my idea of Irish music - no \"Danny Boy\" was to be heard, mostly pop with an Irish flair.  The restaurant was loud even without the music.  It was crowded.  But I loved it!!",

    "text": "It was 1am when I came here after a long, tiring day of \"walking the strip.\" Entering this place didn't feel like Vegas.  Live music was playing and the Irishman singing pumped the energy up; he had everyone singing and clapping to Irish songs we've never heard before.  The food was comforting and delicious. My friend and I ordered the shrimp cocktail, shepherd's pie and sweet potato crisps.  It's an authentic Irish pub; the interior design, the lengthy whiskey collection, the fun, lively ambience, the music, and the majority of workers (who are extremely kind and humorous) and customers are Irish.   I enjoy that you can take a break here from all the Vegas pizazz and just get to bond with people over music and food.",

    "text": "I've been going to Riras at least 3 times a year the last few years. Mostly because my grandma likes it. I tolerate it. It's ok. But this last weekend we went in to watch the UFC fight. It was a $40 cover charge for each person (not including food and beverage). It's not a terrible price. We arrived early (4pm) 3 hours prior to the main event. I had previously called in and asked if seating was guaranteed and they said no,  but if I arrived early enough, I would be able to get a table for my group of three and be guaranteed viewing of the fight. So we stuck around and ordered food and drinks for 3 hours at our table. Right at about 7pm large groups of people starting arriving and helping themselves to the seats at my table. I normally wouldn't mind but these people were incredibly inebriated. One Native American man was walking into furniture and kept being served. A group of 3 young Irish fans sat at my table and were mostly nice but then invited 5 more people. All very drunk. So now my table is completely taken over by people standing and yelling, but not at the fight. Yelling at each other and at the Englishmen at the bar. Keep in mind I have my 80 year old grandma and my wife with me. It got to the point where chicken wings we ordered were slowly disappearing. An elderly couple a table ahead of us was being bullied throughout the night and being accosted for their table (in a prime location in front of the projector). One man kept picking fights with strangers. His wife/girlfriend moved her stool and sat directly in front of the big screen. We called the bouncers and they said we should all stand up to watch the fight (my grandmother is in a wheelchair.) so now the people who arrived the earliest are the only people who can't watch the fight. The people who showed up right before the main event are all standing and blocking the projector. So much for \"guaranteed to watch the fight.\"  As the fight progressed into the later rounds people started throwing chicken wing bones into the crowd. Another man in a white long sleeve shirt with a beard was posturing around like he wanted to fight anyone who disagreed with him. Another shorter man in red kept trying to pick a fight with an elderly man and kept flipping him off. Since I couldn't find any Securuty in the room I was in, I called the riras phone number and asked for security. They never came. The restaurant seemed understaffed and lacked adequate security. It wasn't safe. I know I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Me and a few other people took photos and recordings not only of the rowdy guests but of the indifference of the staff.  As for the food, it was good. The beers were cold. I wish they would have turned up the sound to the fight. I've never seen a fight in a closed circuit viewing and had the restaurant not play the sound to the PPV. It's part of the experience and it wasn't like they were playing any music in the restaurant. There were other things that ruined the experience but I will leave it at that. I know many people will say \"why'd you bring your family to a fight night at a restaurant?\" The truth is my grandma and wife, like myself love the UFC. And we watch so many fights in Vegas and we've never had a bad experience at Lagasse Stadium at the Palazzo, the Still at the Mirage, or Cabo Cantina at the miracle mile shops. I'd like to return some day. Maybe for a drink. But I just don't know anymore. I waited a few days after my experience to see if after I cooled down I'd still feel the same way before I write a review. And if you look at my history I never write reviews, maybe 1 or 2 ever. And unfortunately in hindsight, it actually feels worse.",

    "text": "One of the things about staying in Mandalay Bay is that you're kind of isolated from the rest of the strip, so if you want to get something moderate to eat and don't want to go to the cafe, you're kind of limited.  So it's brilliant that they opened all these restaurants between the walkway to their sister resort Luxor.  Among these places is a gem of an Irish Pub, Ri Ra.   We wanted to get a decent bite for dinner and have a beer, so this matched our criteria perfectly.  We were late for happy hour and we sat in the area behind he main bar which suited us fine because there was a party going on in the main area and it was loud.  They have an excellent selection of beer and Irish drafts, which was great. Our server had a thick Irish accent and he recommended potato cakes and chicken wings for appetizers, though said everything was good.  We got the potato cakes and they were great.  I ordered the Shepherd's pie, which was delicious, and my buddy got the Irish beef stew.  He liked it, but said he should have ordered the Shepherd's pie after tasting mine.  One thing though, is that it's made with ground beef and not with lamb, because I always thought that authentic Shepherd's pie was made with lamb and not beef?  I may be wrong though but it was still delicious.  We didn't have any dessert.  I'd go back and may even order the same thing.",

Service  has always been friendly and we never had to wait long even when they are busy. Friday nights locals get 40% off their bill!  So back to the fish n chips. Fish is moist, batter is crispy, not greasy. Chips are golden, nice potato taste with a bit crisping at edges. Perfect. So that's my 2 cents.",

We shared both and it was more food then we could eat. However both were incredible and I would get them again without hesitation.   To be absolutely honest if there was any issue at all it would be that the fresh bread they brought was slightly burnt on the bottom but it was still great and did not prevent us from eating it.

    "text": "I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this place. We got stuck in traffic coming back from a show and there was nothing else open for dinner. The bouncer at Mix lounge told us it was the only place open at 11pm (this is Vegas, why does everything close at 10?! BS...). We had walked past it earlier and decided against it, we were in a sushi kinda mood.   I am so glad circumstances basically forced us to come here because it is now one of my favorite places in Vegas (along with this amazing, yet magically disappearing, sushi place we found once on our way to the Shark Reef and have never been able to find again *sad face*).   Food - I had the Irish chicken curry and the mister had fish 'n chips. Both of us being from mixed Anglo-Indian backgrounds; and I, having very briefly read up on the history of Indian cuisine in the UK, felt curious to try this mystery dish. It comes with rice or chips...I got half and half in order to have both! Ah-mazing. And so much food! I almost made it to the end, but had to quit a few fries short of the finish line. Husband inhaled his fish, he had both sauces and loved the Irish one (not the tartar sauce, though that was delicious as well). The soup special was \"leek and turkey\" ...scrumptious! You can find \"inexpensive\" ($10-11) items on the menu although most entrees were around $16-$22 and most appetizers were in the $10 range. It is Vegas after all..  Atmosphere - there was a band playing Irish music. From reading other reviews, I guess it's a regular thing? Good, because it really set the tone, we LOVED it (they also add a band fee onto the dining receipt, very European heh). The decor is amazing. We didn't know where to look and what to admire first! Bathrooms were clean and comfortable.   Service - Excellent! All the servers were kind, courteous, friendly and very helpful! And most seemed to have Irish accents, we were left wondering if that was a condition of working there: to learn how to speak with an Irish accent. No way all the waitresses are Irish....right? I'm still not sure... anyway the manager came out towards the end of our meal to ask how everything had been. Really nice gesture :)  Their kitchen is open until 12 midnight but they were still bringing in, seating people and serving them up until we left at 12:01AM soooooo maybe that cutoff time isn't set in stone (?).   Excellent, outstanding everything. Definitely coming back.",

It's beautiful, it feels \"authentic,\" and I haven't had a bad dish. Plus, most of the staff is actually from Ireland and are all really friendly!   I've tried a few dishes since each visit was with a large group and allowed for a greater variety of samplings. During this visit, I ordered the \"IRISH POTATO CAKES\" again and it was good. It had a mashed potato consistency with a nice crust and tasty seasoning. Great contrast between the sour cream-like sauce and balsamic reduction drizzle. I also ordered the \"UNIQUELY VEGGIE\" burger (housemade white bean patty, crumbled goat cheese, sun dried tomato pesto, cucumber, caramelized onions on toasted wheat) with a side of housemade chips. The patty was really great and everything came together well. The goat cheese was a tad too much, but that's just the nature of the cheese. It also needed a little more flavor or just salt, which is a simple fix.  Their bar is wonderful too. I ordered a Jameson + Ginger and it had a generous serving of Jameson, plus delicious. Ruben enjoyed a Guiness Foreign Extra Stout (very cool Guiness store next door!).",

Sat at the bar and after waiting for quite a while was informed by a frazzled waitress that it was waitress services only no bar service ( even though every seat at the bar was occupied) Trying to get served was almost impossible on of the patrons close by resorted to getting there drinks from the main bar which resulted in being the smartest move as it was bought cheaper and quicker .  At one point I thought there was going to be a riot as the staff could not seam to get the volume working on the tv.  All in all a very disappointing experience , Any one I spoke to there was of the same opinion , and there was quite a good crowd there .",

For our entrees we ordered Grilled Bangers & Mash, and House Brined Corned Beef & Cabbage. The Bangers were wonderful, tasty, and perfect!! Coming back for those again! The Corned Beef & Cabbage was good, but had large amounts of fat on it. Still tasted great.   Parking Advice: Follow the signs to the Shoppe's Valet on the Luxor side of the street. The line is much shorter, and is very close to the restaurant.  Servers were great, friendly, and most have an Irish accent that completes the overall experience.  FYI: They add a \"Live Entertainment Tax\" that is equal to about 10% of your entire bill. Not being from here, that came as quite a shock to us. I just thought I'd share. Overall we will never miss a chance to stop in here when we are in town. This will be a regular stopping point for us from now on.",

Definitely Recommend Stopping In For Some Delicious Appetizers. The Fried Deviled Eggs Are A Must and Chicken Bites Were Just As Tasty.  I Had The Salad Which Was Closest To A Cobb I Could Find On the Menu. I Do Not Remember The Name, But It Was Pretty Good. Greens Were Actually Green ( that sometimes can be a challenge  out here in the desert) Avacodo Was Fresh. No Onion, Vinaigrette Dressing or  Applewood Bacon For Me, But That Was Ok According To Our AWESOME Server Sara!! She Was On Top Of Everything!! My Salad Came As Requested With All The Extra Requests Being Met, And The  Healthier Choice Didn't Disappoint.  Husband Had The Fish And It Was HUUUUGE!! No Way Could He Finish It. He Was Happy With His Choice and Absolutely Loved It!  The Ambiance Was Super Cool. Especially With The Hockey Game Playoffs  Being Played On MOST Of The Flat Screens Inside. Even Though We Were Seated Away From The Screens,  Cheers For The Local Las Vegas Golden Nights Rang Throughout. It Made For A Nice Change To Our Normal Dining Experience. Never Was it Too Loud, Constant Or Bothersome. It Was Just Enough To Make Me Smile Hearing People  Happy.  I Enjoyed The Ambiance, The Food, and Fantastic Service! That Being Said, We Will Be Returning Sooner Than Later For Sure! Sweet Irish Pub Worth The Bookmark.",

The red onions and sweet nuts go great with it too but there's just something about the cheese and peppers. Then I had my 2nd go to - Curry served half and half. That's half rice and half French fries. Delicious as usual. The wife got the fish and chips. For those of you who have never been here the filet of Haddock fills the huge dinner plate and actually hangs over both sides. Best fish and chips this side of the pond!  They had a special dessert that we decided to share and we couldn't be happier. Bread pudding - so yummy!  You have to try the Scotch Eggs, the deviled mousse is to die for!",

Everything we tried was good and felt worth the price.   We started off with their traditional potato cakes which were packed with flavor. The savory sour cream and the drizzle balsamic truly made the dish. I had a their strawberry salad which was light and refreshing. My husband shared his banger and smash with me which was good. Who doesn't love season packed sausage ya'know. The Guinness gravy that was on-top of the banger was addicting and was probably the main reason we licked the plate after.    Tip They also have a hot Guinness coffee which was smoothhhhhhh and I'd recommend finishing your meal with that. I didn't get the bread pudding as I was stuffed to the brim but half-ways through my coffee I was craving it, thinking how amazing this coffee would be with something so decadent.",

    "text": "My friend and I stayed at the Excalibur for a few days back in July 2015. One morning, we were in search of a breakfast place that wasn't a buffet. We walked over to Mandalay Bay and found Ri Ra.  It's a good-looking pub. Wood is everywhere. I can imagine that the acoustic when live music acts play here would be fantastic. The selection of booze was impressive, as you would expect in an Irish pub.  The breakfast menu was equally impressive. I got the Full Irish breakfast, which consisted of eggs (I got my scrambled), Irish sausages, rashers, black and white puddings, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, and toast.  My meal was tasty and huge. Luckily, I had brought my appetite. Everything was perfect. I especially love mushrooms and baked beans for breakfast. My only explanation is that I never had these items for breakfast until I hit my mid-twenties and have never looked back.  Unfortunately, I don't recall what my friend had ordered. All I recall is that we both asked for tea. For me, it was peppermint and it was perfect.  Our server was friendly and helpful. This pub has a relaxed atmosphere, which my friend and I appreciated.  Prices are cheap here compared to other restaurants in the area. If you want decent Irish fare at decent prices, this place is for you.  (90)",

I literally stumbled into this place the first time several years ago. It was a dismal Saturday at the casino tables, and a friend (from Limerick, Ireland) and I were just walking around so we weren't losing more money. We saw the sign that read: Full Irish Breakfast, served all day.   We were in.   That day, it was just what the doctor ordered. Full Irish for both of us, and a side of fries to split (with curry sauce on the side).   Waitress from Ireland chatted w/ my friend, and we drank a pint waiting for the food. Great atmostphere, very authentic - - well, as authentic as you can get in a \"mall\" in a Casino in Vegas. it is MUCH bigger than it looks from the outside/storefront.   Anyway, the food was perfect, and brought our spirits back to 100%. GREAT FRIES, great full Irish. (with beans and tomato and mushrooms, b/w pudding, the works).   I have since been back 3-4 times, including this past weekend and it never disappoints. I spent my 40th birthday celebration there with friends, and we looked through their iPad app menu of whiskey - - QUITE the impressive selection, ranging in price from ~$5 a shot to ~$800. Great servers, great vibe, great food, great drinks. Everyone has loved everything here:  Recommend: 1. Fish and Chips - - Perfectly fried piece of fish and those great fries 2. Avacado Toast (appetizer): Sounds strange but it's great. Toast w/ Avocado and red onion, balsamic and goat cheese. 3. Corned beef anything: the cabbage, the potatoes and the meat are spectacular 4. Full Irish Breakfast 5. Deviled Scotch Eggs 6. Irish Curry - super flavorful and perfect portions - - do the half rice half fries. :)   Also have done their breakfast - - non-full irish version - - and it's also really great. Corned beef hash and poached eggs, rocked.   Having just returned from Ireland a few weeks ago and being able to compare - - I think this place does an amazing job given what it is - - the aforementioned casino mall pub - - and I will be back.",

    "text": "A tip: 40% off food for locals on Fridays.  A friend told me this before I showed up with four other friends to catch a bite before the Duran Duran show, and it was a lifesaver! No one else knew it, and it's not advertised, so if you are a Las Vegan and you're at Mandalay Bay on a Friday, give this place a try.  We sat in a cutely decorated room in the back. Our waitress was from Ireland (I have a feeling most of them are), and she was both charming and accommodating. Each of the girls had a drink or two, and between the five of us, we hit about everything on the menu: potato cakes, curry (on chips), reuben sandwich, chicken sandwich, pub burger, and fish and chips. I sampled the curry (pretty darn good) and chose a chopped salad for my entree. It was a huge portion and a great deal for the price (especially when you consider that it was almost half off), even though they added chopped chicken, which I didn't request. (No biggie; it probably made the salad more complete, although it was loaded with bacon and avocado as well.)  Had a grapefruit IPA and my first-ever Smithwick's (which I learned is pronounced \"SMID-dicks\"). Deelish! And the food was good, too. A bit pricey without the discount, but keeping that Friday deal in mind, I may be back, concert or not.",

She had also recommended Freed's bakery for a birthday cake, which I went ahead and purchased and arranged for delivery to Ri Ra.  Our arrival went flawlessly, table set up and ready to go.  I gave our hostess some birthday candles and told her about the cake.  Sara Halcomb was our waitress and she did an outstanding job with our drink and food orders.  Great smile, personality and a quick and efficient waitress.  Bravo!  Felicia (didn't catch her last name) was the manger on duty.  She discreetly advised me that our birthday cake had not been delivered and she had her staff trying to contact Freed's.  Shortly thereafter, she advised me that Freed's could not be reached.  However, she told me she had a chocolate cake that they could substitute and that it would be on the house!  Wow, did you guys ever deliver!  Your staff took what could have been a disappointment and turned into a success.  What fantastic customer service.  You are to be commended for hiring and supervising such capable and wonderful people.    We hadn't been to Ri Ra in two years, but I guarantee we will not wait that long to return.  Additionally, I will tell all my contacts on social media about this experience.  Food was delicious, highly recommend the Jameson's Salmon!!",

Between 4 people we ordered...  Deviled Scotch Eggs - Absolutely delicious! Between the fried sausage exterior and creamy yolk mix there's a ton of flavor and textures.   Pub Poutine - Just order it. The lamb is super tender, the fries are nice and crispy...and between the Rosemary, goat cheese and curry the flavor is just incredible.   Fish & Chips - Where'd this thing come from? This thing is ridiculously huge, but ridiculously tasty too. Nice crispy and salty exterior with moist, flaky fish inside. Oh, and the tartar sauce is actually worthwhile.  Mums Mealoaf - Meatloaf in burger form, I'm in. Nice thick slab of meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes, onions and Guinness ketchup. Slap yo mum delicious. Need I say more?  Cider Glazed Pork Chop - No kidding, one of the best I've had in a restaurant. Super thick, meaty pork chop with a slightly sweet glaze. Might even want to gnaw on the bone when you're done.   Guinness Stew - Beef, potatoes, veggies. Simple, but great. This is definitely the heartiest dish we had, but lots of flavor that'll leave you warm and happy.  If only we would've had the room to try out desserts. But really everything we had was great, the service was fast and friendly, and I'd come back in heartbeat. The prices aren't bad and associated resort employees even get an additional 20% off.   TL;DR - Come here. Order whatever the hell you want, it'll be good. You'll leave happy.",

    "text": "\"So, you wanna go to a real party?\"  And with the Irish band playing on the stage, the music and camaraderie amongst the revelers at Ri Ra seemed to mirror that energetic scene from Titanic in which Jack escorts Rose to the \"party\" in steerage.  And what can I say, the Irish know how to throw party!  The environment at Ri Ra is welcoming and full of energy.  Of course, since this is Vegas, everyone was having a drink, enjoying their food, smiling, laughing, talking, enjoying the band, and having a great time.  Though I did not have the distinction of ordering food, I naturally had a drink instead.  A Guinness.....or two, to some degree of certainty.  At this point I can't remember clearly, I only recall having a good time.  The band performing that night was engaging, and the lively music only encouraged the audience to exchange their seats for a place on the dance floor.  Service was friendly and attentive.  The hostess was polite and outgoing.  We sat at the bar and were very well looked after.    BOTTOM LINE:  Forget steerage, the real party is at Ri Ra.",

If you've ever visited Boston you know they do the same thing in their pubs, too!  Friday locals get 40% food!  You can't beat it!  Not Happy Hour specials so if you see a coupon, use it!",

She was very patient and sweet through all my crazy requests and emails!  Everyone loved the food from appetizers to dessert!  My nephew is very fussy.  He wants to be a chef.  He said he tried everything and thought the food was great!  I didn't get any of the appetizers myself but everyone who did thought they were delicious!  We had fish and chips, Guinness meatballs, veggie tray, the Bistro dinner of shrimp, salad, steak, salmon, potatoes,  and chocolate creme brulee.  I wish I thought to get pictures of the food!  If I find someone who did take food pics I will post them.  She recommended Freed's for my cakes which were Awesome!  The service was Outstanding!!  We came a night when the Black Donnelly's were playing. They were Fantastic and played our song for us!  We kept right on dancing and singing with them until we left!  Great time!!  I did my own flowers ordered from Trader Joe's which the staff kindly spread around the room for me.  The Parlour room is not huge but for our party size of 26 it was perfect and Paula made sure we had a little space to do our first dance!  Really she was just the best!  If you are having a reception here in the parlour room the only thing I would say is they have some unusual vintage items in this room.  You might want to have someone in your party turn the \"beano\" game boxes around so they don't turn up unexpectedly in your pictures.  In some they were just plain funny.  Fortunately they were behind our kids table.",

When we asked to move we were placed at an even worse table and the manager and server repeatedly ran into my chair and served us as fast as they could to get us out.

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Sunday with 10 other rowdy bros of mine. It's a tad small but it is quite accomodating and has a very quaint and charming Irish pub feel to it. What makes it even better is that as we walked in, we walked past a table of 5 Irish guys ranting and drinking beers. The presence of real Irish people? Ooooh this place has gotta be legit!  Ordered the bistro chicken sandwich - made with sun-dried potato pesto, mayo, garden rocket, piquant peppers, smoked provolone, all served on grilled focaccia. MMM soo good! And the portions were surprisingly large for a dish that demanded $11.95, especially in Las Vegas!  I also ordred a side of sweet potato tots but those ended up being less than mediocre. Surprisingly moist and soggy rather than crisp. So I would skip that and go with the mashed potatoes or simply chipper chips (fries).   The dish also came with a side of a sauce called malted vinegar mayo which tastes exactly how it sounds. I was never a fan of malted vinegar but some of my buddies enjoyed pouring it all over their sandwiches. It's certainly interesting, not for me, not for everyone, but it's definitely got its niche! =)  So yeah, if you're ever in the vicinity of Mandalay Bay and you're looking for something relatively cheap that's not fast food, I'd definitely give Ri Ra a recommendation as it will probably give you the most bang for your buck! Also, the food is pretty bomb too!",

Walking into Ri Ra, we were instantly taken back to our memorable trip and spent the entire time reminiscing about our trip with our daughter. I had the corned beef and cabbage, which was spectacular. My wife had the Irish breakfast, which was as authentic as the breakfasts we had at all the bed and breakfasts we stayed at on our trip. Our server was very friendly and more than accommodating to our very picky daughter. I wish this place was closer to home as Ri Ra would instantly become our regular hangout.",

The bartenders were irish (Some of them) , the band was flown in from northern ireland. I was in heaven. Even with the bar being so crowded, all of the bartenders were constantly checking on us. We were only supposed to go in for a couple of drinks and we ended up closing the place down. We had so much fun I never wanted to leave. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone.

Located between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor hotel this place offers a great atmosphere (mature crowd, live bands), with excellent food.   From my experience overseas, I find there are two types of Irish bars. There are the \"meat market\" pick up joints that are extremely loud, packed and filthy. Then there are the clean, lively and cozy places like Ri Ra.   Our group was in Ri Ra on a daily basis for either breakfast or pre-drinks and I would strongly recommend it to others who are fans of the Irish Pub Experience.",

    "text": "Last week my husband and I got married at Mandalay Bay and then had our \"reception\" dinner at Ri Ra's with 25 guests.  I was nervous planning everything because we are from out of state and had never been to Vegas.  I had to look at reviews to chose everything from the chapel to the hotel to our reception dinner.  We needed something to fit our budget, but that would be close or within Mandalay Bay for our guests.  Ri Ra's had amazing food at a reasonable price!!!    Paula worked with me to organize our event and plan a menu that would fit our guests and budget.  We picked the options of fish and chips, salmon, and the roast pork for our guests to chose from.  Our guests also got to chose their salad and pick from two desserts.  Paula created our \"own\" menu for our guests.  The food was amazing!!  We were also able to allow guests to order drinks just within a certain price range, so that things wouldn't get out of control.  We had some drinkers with us!  We had compliments from everyone on picking a great place.    They put dividers up to block off our section of the restaurant.  I wasn't sure if this would be private enough, but it was perfect.  The atmosphere was wonderful and our servers were great!  Everyone was friendly and we loved having lots of different beer for our guests to chose from.  They have a band every night, and I was also worried it might be too loud, but we were stationed in the back of the deep restaurant and could just hear it in the background.  This worked out very nicely for us.  It would be fun to be in the front with a few friends and hear the loud music, but for us being in the back was perfect.    I would recommend Ri Ra's to anyone have a large dinner or just a dinner for two.  They were amazing at working with us and answering all of my questions as a bride coming from out of town!  My new husband and I had the fish and chips and the blueberry crumble for dessert.  Yum!",

Should have been a heads up right there but we went with it. There was a live band that night and we chose this restaurant for that reason. We were told all of the tables are currently full near the band but that they would move is as soon as it becomes available. Understandable and we agreed. Over and hour goes by so at that point I decided to take a peak on the table situation. Not one but several tables were readily open. Never asking for the check she returned with it in hand never mentioning the open tables yet again. Never asked if we wanted more drinks. When asked about the table she said, \"I didn't know you still wanted to do that.\" At that point we gave up out of frustration. Food was alright. The poutine was horrible. My Rueben was good although it could use a little more sauce, kind of dry for a rueben. In short, average food and very poor service is what you can expect for this Irish Pub.",

I had the smoked salmon RLT (including irish bacon, smoked salmon, lettuce and tomato) which was simply amazing. I had a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which were also great.  Our bartenders were knowledgeable about all the Irish beers and even got me to try something I normally never would - Guinness Black Label. And I had 2. Great selection of Irish beers on tap and in bottle, and some American beers on draught too.  So glad we decided to head on in. It was well worth the money. We'll be back!",

Small fish has been a bad tail end both times with hardly any fish and often chewy (sign of bad fish). Whatever they've done, go back to how it used to be. Portion sizes vary considerably depending who's in the kitchen I think and service can be good or bad. Until now the food is what keeps us coming back, if that's now slipping then there is little reason left to return. Also, please tell the girls on front desk to smile. The manager needs to observe them for a while and see how customers to to counter and wait, one girl in particular on lunch time keeps her head down makes you wait a minute or so and then raises her head and says 'yes' sharply. If a manager observes her they'd see how rude and unhelpful she is with almost all customers.",

I discovered this place in March 2013 for the first time and loved it then; I went back this past weekend and fell in love all over again.  We were seated at the bar and were taken care of by Junior, who was fantastic!  If you are headed to Las Vegas and want to visit this place, ask for Junior, he is the best!    Here's the thing; 90% of the staff is Irish, the bar was from a bar in Ireland, the flooring in the bar room was the same flooring the Titanic was built on.  The whole 9 yards, have the staff give you a tour (they are always glad to!) and you'll learn even more.  On this visit we ordered the Deviled Scotch Eggs and Goat Cheese Sampler for appetizers, the Shepard's Pie for our meal, and stuck with the Irish Red Ale.  The beer was really good and Junior made sure we were never with an empty glass!  Upon hearing that neither of us had ever tried whiskey, Junior poured us a small, complimentary glass of a Jameson to split which hasn't even hit the market yet and is only available in bars.  He taught us how to drink it and has made a whiskey drinker out of me!  On to the food, our Deviled Scotch Eggs were absolutely delicious -- the breading was light and crispy, the eggs were well cooked and the deviled egg filling with fluffy and flavorful,  The Goat Cheese Platter was delicious; my favorite topped was the honey walnut relish.  The Shepard's Pie was okay -- the meat was a bit undercooked but the vegetables, gravy and mashed potatoes were perfect!  During our visit there was an Irish band covering songs like, \"Sweet Caroline\" \"Hey Jude\" and \"Drop it Like its Hot\"...we had a fantastic time dancing and singing along and the crowd was fun and lively!  I HIGHLY recommend Ri Ra if you're looking for this type of atmosphere -- great for couples too!",

They were nice enough to take our reservation. I ordered fish and chips. Sorry it wasn't that good. I remembered way back when my friend asked if my tongue gets spoiled from eating all the good food. I said no because I still enjoy Del Taco and Wendy's. It's not all together True. I'm sure it's not just me but when you tried something so good that becomes your bench mark. You wish you can find something this good and hopefully doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. The best fish and chips I was at Venetian. Fries are so perfected by your McDonalds and Wendy's that it's harder for mom and pop restaurant to follow suit.   Their chips were fries and they were soft same goes with their fried fish. The fish itself is not flavorful, sigh I wanted to like it so much since I love fish and chips.  For appetizer we ordered chicken wings and it were good only 8 pieces per plate though.  We waited almost 40 mins for our food. The waitress was nice and patient even though I was not. She keep asking, \"are there anything else I can get you?\" and I tell her, \"yes, we like our food\" I was feeling a bit a pressure since I'm the one bringing all my friends here and I wanted us to be served and fed properly.  I tried my buddy steak and it was cooked well, medium, pink, soft, and flavorful. Again it was served with cold, mushy fries. They also serve prime ribs didn't get to try that one but it must have been good since my friend cleaned it up  I like the ambiance if that's how Irish pubs are in Irish I'm cool with it. Love the live band playing Irish tune. I like how restaurant stay True to their culture and identity.   Pro: Ambiance Friendly waitress Ruben sandwich was good a little much on butter but the meat was done well. Do order the ruben sandwich over fish and chips  Con: Food takes  too long to get to our table My fish and fries were not crunchy and fish has little flavor like it was thawed last night. With any seafood items it's best if it's caught in the morning and serve right away. Anything frozen or serve over a day old the freshness is compromised.",

I had prompt service getting seated immediately (table and booth) great service my glass was never empty. Also an amazing scotch list (you must ask for it but they have good descriptions)   The fish and chips were great (and LARGE) their scotch eggs and sweet potato tots were awesome as well (first time I had seen them in tots form) overall cooked to perfection and about as non greasy as this sort of food gets and done perfectly (one of the first times scotch eggs did not just fall apart when I cut them)  Will attend again!",

Not only was it drier than the Nevada desert, I thought it tasted a bit weird.  I smelled the 1000 Island dressing on the other half of the sandwich and it smelled as if it were beginning to turn.  I had the sweet potato tots as a side.  They were soggy and tasted of bad fryer oil.   My friend had a cup of soup that tasted like nothing but salt.  Disgusting.    This place was terrible.  The bartender was friendly enough, but how he can sling this garbage food with confidence, telling you it's delicious, I have no idea!  The only thing that was palatable was the Jameson-neat!",

I mean how could you not stop at this pub after window shopping at the Guinness store right next door.  You just get this craving for a Guinness.  And, no matter what foodstuffs you order, they all taste amazing with an ice cold Guinness or Heineken, on tap. Cheers!  One of the most beautiful pubs that I have ever been to.

There was a band playing, the bar was crowded, and everyone looked like they were having a good time. Some of the staff are even originally from Ireland. I wanted to do my Irish impression, accents and everything, but thought better of it.  I dropped in for some late night eats (10:30pm for an old guy like me) and got the fish and chips, or as someone on Instagram commented -- \"whale and chips.\" It's basically one giant piece of fried fish on top a bed of fries.   *Thumbs down* While the fish and chips may look impressive, there were a few issues. The fish (cod) was super moist and flaky on the inside, but the outside batter was soggy and greasy. I would much prefer 2-3 big pieces of properly fried, crispy fish. Also, having the fish on top of the chips (fries) was a disaster. Obviously, the chips get real soggy real quick. I barely touched them.  If I'm staying nearby, I'll definitely drop in for some drinks and try some other items on their menu. Guinness in hand.",

Being a huge Irish pub fan and a lover of Cider, I first stopped in to pickup a cider for my \"long\" walk back to the Luxor (gotta love Vegas!) and was pleasantly surprised that they offered around 7 different cider options. Clearly I was winning for the day (though my luck at the casino was not nearly as good). They offered Magners, Stella and a few other options. The next day my friends and I were looking for a breakfast spot and hadn't even considered the Irish pub, but low and behold they were open and packed at 10 am. I was even able to get a full breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatotes) and a hot toddy for $17. Once again winning!",

They told me to come back at night, live music etc.  So after my concert,  I stuck my head in to a totally different experience.  I couldn't tell if it was a band or Karaoke but a large crowd was singing \"Wonderwall\" . I guess the Gallagher bros are Irish but I was told \"Irish\" music. Everyone was having loud fun but I was hungry and moved on. I will definitely come back.",

We came here for breakfast first and was delighted at this gem.   It took a minute for us to get a table although no one was there. I think we went when they were still trying to work the kinks out of serving breakfast (they were advertising outside that they were \"NOW OPEN FOR BREAKFAST!\").   I ordered the Full Irish - A proper fry up - 2 eggs, Irish sausages & rashers, black & white pudding, grilled tomato, sauteed mushrooms, beans, toast - It was AMAZING. I've never had black and white pudding, but for the record, it's not the sweet kind of pudding. It's BETTER. It was this savory, textural, explosion of flavor. Amazing. And by the way, the coffee is done in a french press. At your table. If you so please, it can be poured for you after properly steeped or you can pour to your desired steep. Nice touch. I like.  My colleague got the Kilcullen Omelette and swears up and down that he's never had a better omelette. Take note, he's never had brisket before in his life and brisket can go horribly wrong so easily. Props to Ri Ra for making him a believer.   Our waitress was a doll. Loved her to death. She was so accommodating and profusely apologized at their lack of condiments - though we didn't need them. She went above and beyond to get us ketchup and offered compote because they were out of jam. For the love of all, I wish I knew her name. She was amazing.  Going back to Vegas soon. This will definitely be one of my stops. :)",

The comfort food definitely hit the spot after a long day at the day club.",

It is especially bad when it is a band attempting to be Irish singing songs from all genres.  I would have moved on, but others in the group were starving and could not wait to find a new place.  The bar its self is a decent place.  There are a few different seating areas.  The hostess did do her best to seat us as far away from the music as possible.  The food is ok.  I ordered the chipper chips with cheese and bacon.  They come with a malt vinegar mayo, which is a nice touch.  The chips are large steak fries.  They are covered in a decent amount of cheese and bacon.  The service is ok.  The staff is generally friendly.  I am not sure if they are made to force an Irish accent, but it does not work for some of them.",

Lo and behold, a light shone down before me and an Irish Pub appeared. I decided to go in and rest my feet and give my thanks.   I'm a sucker for an Irish pub and It was really cute. Nice and dark, victorian/shop style pub. Dark, rich paneled walls and bar with beveled glass and lots of shop trinkets scattered everywhere like boxes of old sugar, or tins of tea, etc. Super cozy. I debated on ordering an appetizer, but I didn't want to ruin my appetite if I ate with my friends. I opted for a a vodka cocktail and a bag of the cute imported Chipsticks malt vinegar potato snacks they offered.   The bartender had an Irish accent and an Irish band played in the back of the bar. Perfect way for me to rest me feet and revive before I met up with friends!  A great place to stop if you happen to be wandering the Mandalay Bay or Luxor.",

Yet, when you are in Vegas everything just taste better. Of this I am sure.  So please understand how just amazing this place was...take a seat.  Went here for lunch, came back from dinner the same day, then dined the next day for breakfast! Yes, sadly but with pleasure dined for breakfast,lunch and dinner. We even tried a fourth time but the line was unbearable   I don't remember what I had, cuz most of the time I was drinking lik a cliche Irishman. I do remember that two of the three times we ate there was an Irish accent asking me if I wanted another pint. \"yes.\"  Silly questions.  If i think hard, I can conjure from my memory  my pre-gaming and carbo loading for the Vegas half-marathon with a a Guinness and fish and chips.     I was upset that I got the fish and chips because they were just unbeatable, bar none. I know that I may never have such an euphoric and exceptional moment of tasting drunk food again... it elicits nightmares. I am getting help.  NOte: If there is ever a large event happening, the wait will be at least an hour. Be warned. I told you so!  R\\_",

I tried the Raspberry Cider(x2) and they were Delicious. My friend was extremely excited that they had Heineken on draft for a reasonable price. My friend and I decided to order two different things to split because we couldn't make up our mind.   The Worcestershire Chicken was decent, it was just a typical Chicken sandwich nothing amazing but nothing bad. However, the Kilcooly was phenomenal!!!!!!!! It was one of my favorite things I ate during my trip to Vegas.    Oh, I forgot to mention before you get your meal you get Irish Soda bread!    Our waitress was very attentive and knew how our party of 5 need the checks split after only mentioning it immediately when we sat down. I will definitely will be going back on my next trip to Vegas.",

It was a wheat ale and even though I was a bit intimidated by the amount of beer I received, I drank it all. Yup, it was that good.  Ordered some wings as my late-night dinner - surprisingly delicious. I only say that since this is an Irish pub.   Overall, I really enjoyed Ri Ra and definitely recommend stopping in.

Nothing to write home about...maybe just a Tweet or heck, this review will do and then people will know.  Our waiter was a bit on the surly side.  Is that the Irish way?  The food:  I was going to order shepherds pie but instead of beef it was with lamb which I don't care for.  So I chose the beef stew and mash.  It was, well, a step above canned beef stew you can buy in the grocery store...but cost 15 bucks.  I had a black and tan to drink and they actually layered it correctly so that's a plus.  I can't say that I will go out of my way to come back here buy maybe use it as a back up if other places are too busy and I already happen to be at Mandalay Bay.",

Good selection of beer but why just list the names? I was imagining in a place like this they would describe the beers, if only in a few adjectives or something like yard house or public house. Plus, if you aren't going to describe the beers in the menu, then I guess it falls on the waiter to offer suggestions. I kept trying to (strongly) hint to him that I wanted a sales pitch or some suggestions but he just kept looking away and seemed really rushed or disinterested or both.   I'll come back and give this spot another chance, if only because I love Mandalay so much AND if you are a local on Friday nights you get 40% off entrees.",

    "text": "First the greatest thing about Ri Ra: they offer 40% off on food, every Friday, for locals. And you only need to show one local I.D., so its possible to take friends there with you. That being said, our first visit there as locals [we had stopped in for a drink once before, as visitors to Vegas] was a mixed experience.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant, it feels like a real Irish pub once you get into it from the \"mall\" that houses it. Not surprising, since it was brought over from Ireland. And they play lovely Irish music, but when we went (early evening) it was at a level that still allowed us to talk. And our waitress, also an import from Ireland, couldn't have been nicer. My husband ordered the chicken curry, along with a flight of Irish beers. I had the fish and chips, along with an Irish hard cider. The beverages are filled all the way to the rims. They were at the temperature and level of carbonation (not overdone, on either) that we expect in a pub that knows its business. My husband loved his curry, and I thought the fish was the best I'd ever had: a huge moist filet with thin shattery crust. And the remoulade served with it was delicious...I'd put that on everything! The \"chips\" (fries) weren't as crispy as Americans are used to, but we've found that in many other countries they are used as a base for the main entree, not as a side. So that seemed authentic. Even the brown bread served with the meal was tasty...it reminded me of the brown bread my mom used to bake in cans, for Sunday evening dinners! (And served with real Irish butter.) Now, the reason I took off a star. The dessert was abysmal. They were out of creme brulee (not Irish, but pretty ubiquitous in Vegas). So we ordered the special: strawberry trifle. What we were expecting was the standard trifle in a glass bowl, with liquor-infused cake, custard/pudding, and berries layered, with whipped cream on top. What we got was a couple slices of store-bought pound cake on a plate, each topped with one sliced strawberry, which were almost inedible because they were under-ripe and not sweetened. And a small dollop of whipped cream. Don't know if they didn't have the \"real\" trifle prepped, and just hurried to make up a substitute; or if this pub which tries to be authentic in most other ways just doesn't know what a real trifle is. Whatever...it left us with a bad ending.  Like any Vegas dining/drinking spot, you never know who or what is going to sashay through the door, so its a great place to people watch. Just go someplace else to get dessert.",

    "text": "I was kinda of skeptical when I attempted this place because 1) it was on the Strip & 2) not many Irish restaurants here in town. Usually I make the trek to McMullan's for my bday since it's the only decent place in town. I decided to try Ri Ra after looking at their menu. I must say that I was impressed.  1) The menu pricing was affordable. Nothing was too outrageous, although dinner for 2 costs us $60. Dang beer!!! At least you get complimentary soda bread and bread while you wait.  2) The food was pretty good. We ordered the beef stew and regular size fish and chips. I would say the fish and chips were pretty tasty however the fish was a huge filet inside of a stick so you have to use a fork. I like eating fish & chips with my hands but eh that might just me. Also the chips had no flavor and tasted a little overcooked for being fresh cut fries. The stew was good in my mind that I slurped that sucker down and used the bread to soop up the remaining sauce. It was beefy and packed with veggies plus the scoop of mash taters. I thought all the flavors were balanced evenly.  We arrived around 7:30 and were seated within 5 minutes. The layout and design of the place is quite interesting. It's pretty dark in the front until you walk to the back where most of the dining is. It's made to resemble an pub in Ireland but what do I know I have never been to Ireland! I do know that the management team is actually from Ireland so it was pretty interesting to see actual Irish folks tending to this place and trying to make it authentic. Around 8 pm they have a live band that performs every night. Business was pretty steady while we were there but I will comment that the food wait was quite long. I think we waited almost 25 minutes for our food. At times the waitress did seem a little flustered especially when they brought out the incorrect order of chicken tenders. Service just seemed slow but they had only been opening for a week so we shall see....  However, it is a great atmosphere to hang out and have some good 'ole Irish beer and listen to music. I would totally try this place again because overall the food was pretty decent and made me curious enough to come back and try the Dubliner burger for the True Irish experience.",

    "text": "4.5 stars? Maybe if you've wandered the desert for 30 days desperate for a Guinness. Otherwise, a disaster.  I was just looking for fish and chips and a beer after a long day working a conference. So I sat at the bar on a Monday night and waited. Bar was sort of dirty and gross, took a while to get somebody to wipe it down. Employees are all Irish (or doing passable fake-Irish accents) which is sort of cute and sort of weird, like, do they all get flown over here for some sort of indentured servitude as part of an Irish government program? One can only hope.  Anyhoo, a waitress finally got to me and I got a Kilkenny and the fish & chips, Kilkenny was flat, which was disappointing. Fish & chips came quickly, and the fish was a massive portion and not bad (if a tad bland) but the fries were foul, greasy, cold and congealed. While I'm picking at the fish, a group of douchebags next to me gets into a conversation about the gays, how in San Francisco they're all \"kissing on each other\" in public, in Kentucky we don't have any of that, blah blah blah. Loud homophobes aren't a restaurant's fault but, you know, just portraying the spiraling ugliness of the evening.  It took a full half an hour to pay -- 15 minutes to get someone's attention, 15 minutes more since they were having some sort of problem with the credit card machine, which never did get worked out, I finally slapped down my last $25 in cash and got the fuck out of there.   Inevitably, later, I had the craps, and I don't mean Vegas-style.",

Food was great. being in the hospitality industry for over 38 years. being a owner operator for 21years i am very critical when i dine out. we enjoyed it so much went back the next day. customer service was spot on. Not to mention how beautiful this pub is. i cannot image how many millions they spent for the build out. As a restaurant owner i can appreciate all the hard work they do.",

    "text": "Simply, a great Irish pub.  Let's go down the list of what makes a pub comfy and Irish:  - Well-stocked whiskey list -- Check.  (carrying the spectrum from Powers to smoky 30 yr scotches) - Several Irish beers on draft -- Check.  (Harp, Kilkenny, Guinness, Smithwick's, Murphy's and more in bottles -- throw in some craft American beers in the mix as well for the win) - Long hardwood bar -- Check. (a bar patron needs some polished heft under the elbow at an Irish pub to sit for awhile) - Live Irish music -- Check. (consistently hosting excellent bands with a fiddle and a crooner singing out Irish ballads.  Other folks have suggested the music can be a little loud, but the bar is laid out with various rooms, so there's plenty of nooks to sit in and chat while the music is in the background) - Televisions with rugby, soccer and hurling -- Check. (Irishmen need their sports on a green pitch) - Fried foods and classic pub fare -- Check. (Their fish and chips is perfect and massive.  Thick cut fries and a whole cod battered and fried -- so much fish that you may need to split it)  Beyond that, it's comfy.  It's welcoming.  The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly.  And for the locals, they offer a 40% off food special on Fridays.  It's on the strip (in Mandalay Place), so not the easiest \"neighborhood pub\" to wander into without planning to be there, but it's just a great hangout.  I award a tie for best Irish Pub in Vegas to McMullan's Irish Pub and Ri Ra.",

I'm am a huge whiskey fan so to see their walls lined with whiskeys was pretty great.  I also like beer and they have a ton of different kinds.  They also have something called a Shandy which is half beer, half lemonade/soda and it was $4.  Not bad at all.  The service from the waiter the first time and bartender the second time was equally great.  This bartender was like a dancer just moving about the bar and hooking people up with some perfectly poured pints.  I will, without a doubt, go back here again!",

I am entertaining customers out west; We have eaten at several places out here but no place has popped like Ri Ra. The menu is complete Irish, great food for great prices and the beer is off the charts. The menu is authentic, portions are large and price is more than reasonable. To recap: Quality of Food was a 10, Quality of Service was a 10, and Value was a 10.  Demy was our waitress and she made the afternoon so very special by walking us through the specialities of the house and giving insight into menu selections which is all too often lost these days.   If you have one place to go tonight in Vegas, Ri Ra is a must and Demy is a plus as a waitress; she made a great visit even better.",

The part of that meal that was the biggest disappointment was that my husband asked for more iced tea, and was charged for it. We were not warned that there were not free refills. In all our experiences at restaurants we have never come across a place that charges for refills on iced tea, unless of course it is sold in a bottle. At nearly $4 a glass, the restaurant should rethink their approach, as the money unfortunately came out of our waitresses tip.",

He ordered his favorite thing (sausage rolls) \" a must have!\" He says....10 minutes later the manager comes over and says they don't have them prepped yet in the kitchen, \"it's too early\", uhhhh it was 1:00! Don't have it on your LUNCH menu if it won't be ready till dinner. My husband and I are both chefs here in town and I coulda gone back there and done it in 5 minutes! How hard is it to wrap some dough around an order of sausage?   Mussels appetizer- mom gave me a bite, and lucky me got a  rotten mussel which I spit out into a napkin and smelled up the whole table so bad, I had to put the plate with one mussel on it on the table next to us. I'm pregnant and this really was horrifying.   House salad with blue cheese dressing- dressing tastes like it came from a bottle of wishbone   Fish n chips- gross! Tarter sauce can't be home made, incredibly thick and overly  sweet, I had to add 3 lemon wedges to one ramekin to make it \"edible\"   Reuben- sister ordered it with sweet potato fries which turned out to be over cooked and brown sweet potato chips. I'm sorry but when your menu says fries, people want fries, there's a huge difference. She said the sandwich was good though.   Volcanic wings- the highlight of the meal, nice and crispy but hardly volcanic. Again, home made dressings is where it's at and this place doesn't seem to have it.",

The cream they gave with the scones was really good too.   Aside from the tea party, I decided to get an Irish coffee that the other reviews raved about. The reviews were correct, and definitely made the tea party all the more enjoyable. The staff was so nice, I think our waiter was Dustin or Rustin? Shout out to him for being awesome.

From the decor to the selection of beer to the fitting and awesome live music, this place gets 5 stars from me.  My favorite part was the service. Luckily, every time we came in, our bartender was Fitz. He's literally the coolest Irishman. Oh! And so is Gunner who we also met on our last night there. These two were so much fun. It was a blast every time we came in. I asked Fitz to pick things off the menu for us to eat and he hit it right on the nose. I wish I wrote everything down so I could add more to this review about the food because it was amazing. But, I was in Vegas, and a little distracted and intoxicated. Thanks to the bartenders. Haha. Anyway, I love this place. One of my favorite bars in Vegas. Fitz - best bartender in town. And we will definitely be returning soon!",

We were gouged and ripped off and our waiter looked like he was a tweaker and rushed us through everything. I had better service from a Denny's waitress. And then they gouged us gratuity for three people and we only had two meals and a drink each. And then the other waitress insulted us by saying \"is this what you do to get out of gratuity.\" By then I was so mad I could have punched her.  So we just said we would never be in again. And walked out because neither one of them handled the situation the guy was stuttering bc we called him out on charging us gratuity and the card had already been ran. So if you want to get hustled here's the place to go.",

Our entrees included Glazed Salmon, Prime Rib, Fish & Chips, Mums Meatloaf Burger.  Service excellent. Food served quickly. Portion size and taste continues to exceed expectations.  The Salmon and Mussels were the best we ever had.  Don't pass on the draft beers.  The tap menu changes.  I missed my Kilkenny Irish Cream Ale but made do with a Pint of Guinness Stout. Music an added bonus. Great for families. Pub casual.",

They had a great band playing, that me, my mom and Grandma all enjoyed, so that's something! The potato pancakes were AMAZING!!! We all got corned beef and cabbage like the American-Irish we are. I loved the cabbage which isn't usually my fave, it was steamed and I loved the texture. Yumm yumm on everything... including our handsome and very kind waiter Sean. In a weekend of shitty service (Cracker Barrel, Fiesta Mexicana) Sean really stood out. Attentive and genuine without hovering. Plus he's only been in Vegas a month... just moving here from Ireland. So that just topped off the experience. Oh plus they had Hard Rootbeer which is the only alcohol we can get my Grandma to drink, so that was fun too. 40% off food (not alcohol) for locals too made it a cheap delicous meal on the strip.",

As we are both Irish normally our 1st port of call is to make sure there is an Irish Pub within walking distance of our hotel, we were lucky to have two, the Nine Fine Irishmen and Ri Ra but after having a fab Christmas dinner, creamy pints of guiness just like home and the only place in Vegas to serve Magners we soon made ourselves at home. We also had an Irish breakfast that couldn't be faulted along with Club Orange and Lemon, tayto & starbars, after being away from home travelling for the past 8 months this is the closest we have come to having a home cooked meal and having the Craic with bar staff just made us go back for more. Thanks Ri Ra for giving us a little bit of home in Vegas... We will most certainly be back and will send all the homestead we know your way. Cheers!",

I noticed several other solo diners, as well. The menu was lengthy, and the waitress suggested the fish and chips or corned beef. Well, the fish and chips were outstanding! I couldn't finish the fries. They came with malt vinegar and a very tasty tartar sauce.  I forgot to mention the healthy selection of beers on tap, as well as bottled beers.  You really can't go wrong here. I think you'll find something for everybody!",

The sausage rolls are super-tasty: plump and juicy bangers wrapped in a crisp, puff pastry served with a rich and creamy mustard sauce.  I would also recommend the fish n chips, fresh haddock battered and deep-fried, yet lightly crisp, not at all oily and heavy.  We also really enjoyed the shepherds pie, the ground lamb was very flavorful and was balanced out perfectly with the mashed potatoes on top.  I also got a chance to try Irish shandy, which is a cross between beer and lemonade.  I'm not a big beer drinker in general, but a touch of sweet, citrusy tang was a real refreshing twist!  Service here is fast, friendly, and genuine.  I would love to come back on my next trip!",

I came in with my bf around 12am after walking back and forth from Luxor to Mandalay to find a cool place that's not too expensive for a little late night rondevu before bed. So in we go, it's dark as hell in there, live band with surround sound thumping super loud. At first it was too loud until you sit down and realize the people around having drinks are even louder - which was fine because everyone was having a good ol' time and I'm all for that.  The bf and I sat down at the bar and we were greeted immediately by a cute Irish speaking guy; strong accent but very cool like the one youd hear in a movie. So we get to looking at the menu and then we ordered the mild buffalo style wings (multiple flavors you can choose from ie Guinness style etc) which were priced at $8.95 and the guiness beef stew $15.95.   While waiting for our food, couple guys were standing behind us (we were sitting at the bar). The guy says to the gal bartender, \"hey I'm here with a friend and hes a beer drinker, me not so much kind of talk so what can you get me that's not so bitter, I like more sweet.\" So she goes and grabs two cups and filled them up with new castle and guiness which I thought was cool cause who gives trials of beer? The guy who was ordering thought it was awesome too. Mind you when I came in, I was extremely tired from a trade show I'd attended earlier in the day so I was in no mood but after seeing all that, I was pretty much in the mood now. Shortly thereafter, our wings came in and I was thinking DAMN! I was expecting 5-6 wings, hey we're in Vegas and at the price marked I was surprised, probably 15 wings total. We get to biting and immediately I was like this is mild? it's so good but it's pretty damn spicy - more like atomic wings from wing stop, no complaints it's just a bit spicy I couldn't even finish one. The bf and I ate all the celery to calm the heat but nothing could tame it. Our bartender asked if everything was ok, we told him yeah except we were not expecting the wings to be soo spicy, so he laughs cause the bf's sweating his forehead off haha and he hands over more napkins. He's like yeah man (with his accent) we can change it up for you if you want, bf says no it's good man (dont want to cause too much trouble). We refused anway after a few more attempts - so a waiter comes out and gives us two large cups of milk and some fresh made vanilla ice cream - yum! Then the manager comes up, laughs and says hey were sorry, I heard from my kitchen and the bartender that our mild wings are a bit much, she also recommended we change the wings too but we tell her no. When our tab finally came out, they charged us only the beer. This was totally unexpected because we weren't complaining they were just that cool about everything. The entire crew here has awesome hospitality and their service is on point!  I gave the guys a $15 dollar tip for a 7 dollar guiness beer :) they deserved it. You guys are awesome!!!!",

Our waiter, who hails all the way from Ireland, is amazing. i'm kicking myself for forgetting his name. He was incredibly friendly, planned the whole birthday cake reveal, engaged us in conversation and all his recommendations were divine! Try the shepard's pie and potato croquette. The shepard's pie is even better than those i've had in Dublin! The band playing that night was awesome sauce and gave a shout out to my bf, as well as played our requested songs. They chatted with us during their break and we gave them and our cool waiter the rest of the birthday cake just coz they were so awesome. Seriously, our new rule is to visit Ri Ra each time we're in Vegas. The food is too scrumptious and the wait staff, just plain wonderful!",

At first we thought this was awkward, but further in the restaurant was a live band, so we were actually glad to be seated away from the loud music.  They were out of the Kilkenny I ordered first.  No problem; I ordered a Smithwick's.  The server came back and informed me they just finished a keg and it would be a little while before it got changed out.  Sure, a little frustrating, but the server (who had a lovely Irish lass's accent) was so nice and apologetic I couldn't get too frustrated.  Guinness it was!  I had the shepherd's pie, while the lady had the beef & Guinness stew.  Quite simply, the shepherd's pie was the best I've ever had.  Lamb and vegetables tender and in a wonderfully savory gravy.  Mashed potatoes perfect thickness and good at balancing out the salt of the lamb mixture.  The stew was also very good.  A little on the thin side as you might expect from an Irish stew, but a great flavor.  Both dishes came with some soda bread and Irish butter.  We also ordered a side of the hand cut chips with malt vinegar mayo, which was good, but nothing really special.  Overall, great main dishes and good service will have me coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

This Irish themed establishment is located in Mandalay Place which is a commercial walkway that connects the Mandalay Bay and Luxor hotels. I was reluctantly dragged here by a good friend who relishes all things Irish and made this excellent called shot. The gastropub and traditional beer offerings we sampled were excellent but the highlight of the evening was the international crowd and musical entertainment. The two musicians performed a mixed set of Irish tunes and pop classics that totally engaged and involved the audience. Think drunk English male patron on stage belting out obscure tunes, twenty something females acting as go-go dancers, swaying dance partners and numerous sing-a-longs. Great fun to say the least.",

Different rooms for however your feeling....more intimate feeling, bar type feel, or just there for food. I hope to go back a few more times before we leave!

It doesn't hurt that it was constructed from a pub in Ireland and then shipped here, which makes it even more intriguing to visit. The yummy food, good service and laid back atmosphere are some of the reasons why I'd absolutely come back again. I felt like I had to downgrade my rating one star for the overpriced wine we had (even by Las Vegas standards).",

The wings had almost no flavor at all except for a hint of sweetness.  The NY strip was cooked correctly, but had a ton of grizzle.  The chips (fries) with the NY strip were cold and greasy.  They brought a new order of fries that were hot, but the grease was overwhelming.  The mushroom risotto was sticky and starchy with little flavor.

    "text": "A friend and I recently ended up here before going to the Katy Perry concert at Mandalay Bay.  We had initially planned on dinner at Burger Bar, but that was a bust when we found out there was a one hour wait and tummy's were a rumbling!  Enter Ri Ra.  I wasn't sure what to expect...but to be honest, at the time, I didn't care as I was starving.  Because there was also a wait at the pub, we ended up sitting at the bar.  Go figure.  Oh my, was I pleasantly surprised!  I had the Irish Potato Cakes (ok, I'm an appetizer kind of gal), and they were soooooooo good.  I love potatoes (hence, my obsession with french fries), and the cakes were soft, but not mushy, and had just the right amount of saltiness with the balsamic glaze.  I also had the chips and malt vinegar mayo (yeah, ok, there was a bit of potato overload).  The mayo was de-li-cious!  A nice contrast with the chips and change of pace from ketchup.  I was so stuffed I decided not to have an entree.  The drinks department also did not disappoint.  My friend had some beers and I had a couple of Dark and Stormy's, which I'm not used to seeing on menus that often.  The drinks were good, not too strong.  Best of all, our bartender/server was Irish and fun to chat with.    I agree that the pub is noisy, but in a good way.  This is not somewhere you'd go to catch up with a long lost friend; it's somewhere you'd go to have fun with a smaller group of fun people.    But the best part was that as a local, I got to sign up for a \"Green Card.\" The Green Card equates to a 20% discount off food/drinks for locals.  Yay for discounts and yay for locals!",

Our waitress Finnouala was from Belfast, and helped make the whole experience more than perfect. My friend's aunt happens to be going to Belfast in a month, and she gave her insider tips on where to go and what to do. We lingered to listen to the band and drink our drinks.

My first visit was a dinner time, so I had the fish and chips, which was a single slab of Atlantic haddock on a pile of fries. Tasty. The waitress suggested the rice pudding for dessert and it was terrific. And speaking of simple goodness, they also have a delicious soda bread.   My second visit was following a long session at the poker table. Most everything around the Excalibur/Luxor/Mandalay Bay corridor was closed at 2 am, but this place was my late night rescuer. Still serving beer until 3 am and an adequate bar menu, too, I was able to get a little 1/4 pound Chipper burger and fries. It came with a curry mayo that was super-good.   Live Irish music, good sports on the TVs at the bar, and plenty of friendly folk to strike up a conversation with. Seemed like a top-notch place to me.",

My corned beef was wonderfully flavorful and the Shepherds pie looked good, but the gold medal goes to the fish and chips. Oh my, it was massive. Super gigantic, great flavoring. Nom nom nom.

Sat down on Friday afternoon for a pint while shopping and struck up a conversation with two of the guys behind the bar.  Really nice people, made us want to go back later for dinner, and we did.  And we were glad. Oh, and they recognized us.  We weren't looking for anything, but that tells me something about the persons tending bar and the atmosphere of the place.     For dinner, I can only remember what my husband and I had, not our friends, but we had Shepard's Pie and a Kilcooly sandwich.  I do know that all four of us were quite happy with our meals.  They pull a proper pint of Guinness, which really should be mandatory for anyone who serves Guinness.  Great choices for beer.    Good music was also another reason why we like the place.  The band was from Ireland and they were weaving in traditional songs and their own songs.  My understanding is that they bring a lot of bands from Ireland in.  While we were there they were showing Rugby World Cup and football from all over.  This is a good place to go if you are looking for Premiership.  I will be back.

The potato/leek soup was also very good.  I'd probably come in here again, it's located in between Mandalay Bay and Luxor in the Shoppes on the 2nd floor of Luxor.",

My new husband (!!) wanted to see the inside of The Luxor, so we Yelp'd a restaurant there, not giving too many Fs about the reviews, because we needed fuel for the day.  I figured this place would be a \"meh\" or a \"it was good.\" kinda place, since it was inside the walkway between casinos, but I was wrong!  The menu has elements of Irish dishes, but they're further inspired.  I had the brie grilled cheese - so good - and the Mr. had a turkey club (I fail to recall the name), both were awesome!  My side was Brussels sprouts and bacon, and WOWZA, for a sprout lover they were fabu!  They were shaved, almost like a salad, and I inhaled them.    Lots of beer and drink choices, too.  Our bartender was super friendly, let us sample a few beers before deciding on our second round.  He even provided sympathy & compassion when I spent 25 minutes on hold with Southwest after they accidentally cancelled our flight home.    I was pleasantly surprised, and would recommend to any Vegas visitor for a great lunch stop!",

I'm def not okay with server trick customers and be like \"I know you don't have money you are just stupid Chinese\" attitude. I was asking the waiter if the whisky is sold by bottle or by glass. He said the ones on beverage menu are sold by glass. I asked him if any of them are sold by bottle, he said he can bring me another menu. Then we ordered black label on the menu for $16. It turned out that it's only for a shot. When I ask again for double check, the waiter said that's for a shot and just like \"sorry we don't do bottles\". I mean black label is def not some expensive whiskey, I won't be surprised if they sell small bottles with such a price. The entire time, he's very warm to the couple next to us but be like \"I guess you don't know English that much I don't want to talk\" to us. I've been in States for years and I speak perfect English. And they didn't warn you when doing the refill for ice tea.  Food is good. Experience, worse than ever.",

I was here on the Sunday before CES at 5:30pm and my wife and were among maybe a dozen people in the whole place.   I ordered the ordered the fish and chips and my wife had a shepherd's pie. She liked her meal but wasn't able to finish it so come hungry if you intend to order this. The fish and chips were also very large, fish was almost perfect but minus one star for lukewarm and sorta soggy chips.   Great whiskey and beer selection, beautiful place inside, and fantastic service. If only for the sake of the many Las Vegas residents who make a living inside the Mandalay Bay, I encourage you to go back and be a patron of the restaurants, nightclubs, venues, and bars. The servers and bartenders are likely struggling right now.",

We were asked what we would like to drink while we waited for our server. My husband got the Guinness and I just got a coffee and a water. It took longer than usual for our waiter to come and take our order. I would say at least 10 min. Once he arrived, I ordered the sausage bangers and my husband ordered fish and chips.  The bangers arrived pretty quick and was so disgusting. The sausages were hard as a rock, tasted like they were days old, I ended up spitting it out. When the waiter came back, I let him know and he said he would just take it off the bill.  The fish and chips came out, huge as everyone else has previously said but flavorless to me. The tarter sauce was good. Fries tasted like fries, nothing special.  My husband said he thoroughly enjoyed his meal and would go back again. I personally would not. There are too many other places in Vegas to try!",

So my sister recently discovered this place and decided to take me and my bro over the weekend. When you first walk in, you're immersed into the expected fish and chips bar scenery...but then you keep walking...and walking...and suddenly realize you're walking into many different rooms with different themes. I seriously felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole because it's so much bigger in the inside!   The kind hostess led us to our reserved table in a room surrounded with red curtains and a lit Christmas tree in the back. Our table was already set with a dainty tablecloth, teacups, and menus placed in the middle. I was already impressed!  Our waitress who had pink hair came to take our orders and she was incredibly helpful. Since it was my first time here and not familiar with teas, she was so kind enough to bring out the herbs for all of us to smell! She and the manager was also super intent with my vegetarian needs and even made a separate customized platter for me! A++ for customer service!  Price: Afternoon Tea: $22 +tax . A pretty good deal compared to other tea places in Vegas.Also make sure to make a reservation a day ahead!  Food:  As for the food, they really don't skimp out on their portions. The food comes out in a three-tier stand with the following: Top: desserts (creme puffs, cake rolls, etc) Middle: scones with jam and creme Bottom: sandwiches and cheesy bread slices The scones were soft and crumbly and the sandwiches were packed with filling! However, the cheddar bread slices were a bit dry.  Teas: We each got a different pot of tea so we can try a little bit of everything. My favorites were the Organic Assam and Earl Grey - both are black teas. A great thing is that the pots are refillable with no extra cost.  Overall, this is such a great place for both fish and chips and a couple of beers, or a fancy  afternoon tea with the ladies. Remember, pinkies up!",

Cold Guinness and Bangers n Mash + Ra Ra Veggie burger/sandwich.   Bangers n Mash were just like what they are known for, full meal with dark brown sauce - good strong flavors - but the highlight was the Veggie burger, it was just out of the world. It was so flavorful, each bite, that I tried to exchange it for the bangers n mash with no luck. Next time I will head to Ra Ra only for their veggie burger, good work Chefs.  Service is always good here, very welcoming   See you soon team Ra Ra",

    "text": "Having spent some time in Dublin, and in several \"traditional\" Irish pubs;  This place is probably about 60-70% close in authenticity.  The realism, of the bar and overall look and feel almost makes you feel like you really are in Ireland.  It's just the simple fact that you know you're in Vegas, and the newness of it simply out-weighs hanging out at an old bar that generations of people have relaxed in.    Anyways, here's what I ordered, and why I loved this pub: ~ Deviled Scotch Eggs:  These were 4 pieces of breaded deviled eggs that were creamy and crunchy.  The yolk mix was slightly different than your mustard tasting center.  They call their center a creamy yolk mousse.  Truly a different starter choice. ~ Dubliner Burger:  A ground lamb patty with a rosemary aroma.  Now this was a super juicy burger, combined with goat cheese, grilled red onion, and a curry aioli... Man I'm gettin' hungry just thinking about it.  The burger was nice and beefy, and the bun nice and soft. ~ Fish 'n' Chips (small):  Now, the cod was cooked just right, soft and steamy.  The chips were also nice and meaty for fries.  The only thing is, this was not a Dublin sized cod in my opinion.  I regretfully wish I ordered the large.  I should've known better.    All about service: ~ I'm so glad we sat a the bar.  Amanda, our server-bartender did a great job in keeping us company.  She shared some of her favorites from the menu, and made sure our water glasses were filled.  I asked for a Guinness, and she poured it pretty fast.  A \"no no\" in the process, so minus one star.  Yes, I was critiquing, haha!  Atmosphere: ~ As I had mentioned above, the set up was nice only you won't get that Irish feel.  The feeling of knowing you're in a pub that's 150+ years old.  You'll have an American watery Guinness, which was what I expected.  As nothing beats a Guinness made from the waters of Ireland.  A mix of people/tourist.  I mean, for the first time, I had wished there were more drunks singing along and mingling.  Oh well, no biggie, but I definitely a good time hanging out here!    Overall: I'd come back!  The food is good, and the prices are above average.  Worth checking out!",

    "text": "Exterior = 5/5 This is located in the Shoppes area of Mandalay Bay. No joke we were dying for a place to eat and every restaurant was either closed temporarily (why I have no idea) or closed till dinner. I was dying for something not cafe style. We stumbled upon the restaurant as we were perusing the area. We never really had food in an Irish style setting so it was a must try. The first thing we heard as we approached was the game and some music playing. Definitely had that bar vibe. There wasn't a line when we got there, so the lady at the hostess stand took us right in.  Interior = 5/5 I haven't eaten in too many bar settings, unless you count Yardhouse and BJ's. I would say it was very warm and welcoming. You walk into the restaurant and there are a slew of seating choices from bar to high table to booth table combo. We chose the booth table option in the busiest part of the bar since we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere and the ongoing game.   Service = 5/5 The server was really quick to show up even though it seemed to spike in guests after we got seated. He gladly shared his recommendations including his usuals.   Order = 4/5 Fish and chips: 4/5 Boasted by the server to be the best in Vegas, I was expecting fantastic. When I first laid eyes on it, I was impressed. It was basically one side of the whole fish fried, and set in front of me. I was not expecting it to be as large as it was. It had a nice crunch and soft fish inside. Would I say it's the best I ever had in Vegas? Probably not. Would I say it's pretty high up there, yes. I usually don't eat my fish and chips with anything aside from tartar sauce that is given to me, but I had to put vinegar on it.  Reuben sandwich: 5/5 Boyfriend got this one, he had no complaints and enjoyed eating it.  Guinness flight: 5/5 It came with 4 different kinds of beer that I believe only one was available at Vegas. This belonged to my boyfriend. I tried them and surprisingly I liked them since they were dark beers (still slowly trying beers).   Scottish eggs: 5/5 Never had this before, so I had this on my \"had to try\". Liked all the textures that were going on from the crunch of the fried exterior, the chewy sausage lining, and the soft egg in the middle. It was a nice way to start the meal and I feel that it could actually be enough for a nice quick snack with a flight of beer.  Bread pudding: 4/5 I wish I had more space in my tummy for this because boy was this heavy. It reminded me of monkey bread, and it was definitely more doughy and thick than I could handle. It had a good amount of sweetness compared to the consistency of the rest of the dessert.  Overall = 4/5 The vibe of the place was what drew me in and it was nice if you want a pub like feel. Since I don't usually go to a lot of places like this, it was a nice change in pace. The quantity of food was nice and it worked well with the beer. Probably would come back for the beer and a sandwich in the future.  Hint = go for the flight of Guinness. Reasonable pricing with good selection.",

Sometimes it is topnotch and other times you have flag your server down for a beer.   If the manager is reading this review, you NEED to get Beamish Irish Stout on tap!",

Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with our original choice for authentic Irish food and drinks, but luckily we accidentally came across RI Ra Irish Pub the next day! We loved EVERYTHING about Ri Ra!!!! We arrived at 7pm and did not leave until after midnight. We enjoyed a absolutely delicious meal of prime rib and all the trimmings, and the price was well deserved. We had many drinks and they just got better and better all night. The service could not be beat, I wish I would have gotten the name of our first waitress to give her personal recognition for her wonderful service and pleasant personality. She was a big reason we decided to just stay put and enjoy our whole evening at that restaurant instead of going from place to place. We highly recommend this establishment, so much that we called family in town and had them meet us for even more food and drinks that night. Can't wait to visit Las Vegas again very soon and this location is one of the big reasons it will be sooner rather than later!!",

There are many times we were lured by the perfect photo and completely let down in taste. Not this time. We ordered of course the fish & chips. The fish had a very light batter and it was crispy and the batter stayed on the fish even after cutting into it.   We decided on the Irish breakfast burger as the other item. The burger was super juicy and cooked perfectly. We loved our food and will definitely be back. The decor is also great. When we walked through the doors, it took us back to bars in Dublin.",

We all agreed that Irish food sounded great.   There were four of us for dinner. We were seated promptly even though we didn't have reservations. The decor has an old world charm. Dark with a lot of trinkets to look at.   The service was friendly and efficient. Our waters were kept full and the waitress checked on us a few times to see if we needed anything.   The food was incredibly delicious. I split the fish and chips with someone and there was more than enough to share. When the plate was first set in front of us, I thought the fries weren't going to taste very good. They looked pale and soggy. I was totally wrong!!  They were perfect...nice and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside.   My son enjoyed his Irish Breakfast. He said the bangers were the best he's ever had. The eggs were cooked exactly how he asked for them.   My other son had the corned beef and cabbage. It came with these wonderful roasted carrots and mashed potatoes. There was a basil cream sauce that tied everything together.   We all ate every bite. There wasn't any food left over. We will most definitely be back here the next time we're in Las Vegas.",

If staying at Mandalay Bay than this is a convenient option for pretty much any time of day, open for breakfast to 3am.  Nothing about the place really wowed me. They do have a great selection of whiskey and beer. The food is pretty good, service was OK, friendly but definitely not prompt. The prices, just like everything else on the Strip, is high for what you get, $7+ for beers, $21 for fish and chips.   Again, a convenient option but after a few visits I'm not clamoring to go back but would visit again on my next visit to town if staying at Mandalay Bay.",

After 360 hours of nonstop live music, Ri Ra Irish Pub at Mandalay Place broke the previous Guinness World Record back in 2014. You can see their award on the wall by the stage!  Copper tables, liquor bottle lined walls, gorgeous bars... so this is Ri Ra!  I was mildly interested after my homie Amber R. came here so we popped in for some lunch on a humid and hot Saturday.   We ordered the Traditional Potato Cakes, Shepherd's Pie, and some Fish & Chips. We also had the Space Dust IPA [very hoppy] and a Frozen Passion Colada. Portions are super generous here and one entree can feed two easily. I really liked the traditional potato cakes. Slap on some sour cream to cut the richness and it's bliss. My Shepherd's Pie was insanely decadent, topped with fluffy buttery potatoes and a generous serving of juicy lamb in wine, carrots, peas, and leeks. As for the fish and chips, they're exactly what you expect. The size of that cod was impressive.  So Ri Ra makes me go yeehaw! Service was prompt and they even let you sample beers before you commit.",

And it was a cool little pub, pretty authentic.  Our waitress was actually even Irish. She was great, getting us refills, boxes, whatever we needed. They had quite a few customers, but weren't crazy busy.  We shared a burger and the turkey, cheese, and Apple sandwich. My friend liked the burger so much, that I let her trade her sandwich half back to me, LOL. I was fine with the sandwich, and I had almost half of it left for the next day because it was pretty filling. We got fries and the cauliflower gratin to share, and we had some of the cauliflower left as well.  Definitely try this place if you're nearby. It would be a great place to grab a pint, or some food, to distract you from all that gambling.",

They have quite a few tv's which was nice to watch some March Madness during breakfast.  I chose the Irish omelet that had corn beef hash in it.  It was not the most beautiful omelet that I have ever had, but the taste was good.  I could have used a bit more  has in it, as it was pretty light.  We also had a few beers, and the selection is quite good of Irish / Scottish / British ales.  They did have a Boddingtons on draft (listed on the board) that I was excited about.  However, when I ordered it, I was told that the list was not updated.  It was after 12 o'clock, so I would think they should at least update their beer list.  Service was fine and nothing to complain about there.  I would not be opposed to returning, but it also didn't blow my socks off....",

Very dim inside, so don't plan on being able to much read their poorly laid out menus. Scotch deviled eggs were one of those fresh takes on an old favorite that worked out quite well. I still prefer the regular scotch eggs, but these were a very nice change of pace and I'd happily order 100 of them.   On the less good side, don't get fries. Fries are awful. Get the chips. You can have fish if you want, but no matter the sandwich, get the chips. Trust. The Reuben I had was a very sad affair. Bread was stale and burnt. The sauce that was on it I could have really done without and in fact, I pitched the entire sordid affair and just had the meat, cheese and sauerkraut. Sauerkraut was not a great one, but the other two components were ok. Just. Quite a disappointment, but possibly I ordered the wrong thing. I should have probably just gotten a side of chips and a couple dozen Scotch deviled eggs...along with half a dozen pints of Guinness...alas...always next time, I suppose.",

My Hubs said it was the best one he ever had, I am not quite the connoisseur he is, but I found them really good as well. I had to try the fish and chips and they were ok, a little soggy and my Hubs had the rueban and he said it was mediocre. Service was ok, nothing to write home about. There are better pubs in Vegas and this one is middle of the road.",

I didn't have a full meal, as I was meeting friends after I had already dined, but since it was a bar I figured I could partake in some of the other dishes.  I started with a Smithwick's (Which the cool kids, I learned, pronounce as \"Smiddick's\") which I quite enjoyed.  Then moved on to a Irish Iceberg. I didn't really care for the Guinness + Milkshake + Caramel of the Irish Iceberg, but i didn't hate it. Then on to an Irish Coffee, served authentically in a glass, which was really good.  If that wasn't enough, I finished it off with a Guinness Sundae.  Mmm, Mmm! How is that for not eating a full meal?  I would absolutely return!",

Ri Ra, tucked in a shopping center in the Mandalay Resort, opens early and provides a big plate full of breakfast for under $15. Given the Irish slant here, all breakfasts have a similar theme- be ready to chow down on potatoes, bread, eggs, and ham/sausage",

    "text": "What a great authentic Irish Pub!  We were in Vegas for a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend.  I had been working with the management and staff for a few months to pull  off dinner for 16 and I was not disappointed with either the restaurant  or the staff. .    The bar, originally  from Ireland, had been restored and transplanted iin The Mandalay Bay Hotel lock, stock, and dark wooded paneling for it's authenticity.  There was definitely  a pub feel and our bartender had an Irish brogue that was the real deal.   It made me feel like I could sit at the bar with a pint and chill with friends,  but I digress.    We had a long table in the back next to the stage which was the perfect set up for the surprise party.  The staff was incredible and went out of their was to accommodate  our group.  If I could have had 20 people there was a really cool side room that we could have taken  over but that was not to be.    Flights and drinks were consumed and laughs, as well as a few tears of happiness were she'd throughout the evening.   Our server,  whose name I cannot remember for the life of me (blonde gal, Virginia/Shannon...forgive me, it was late) was on top of her game!  I ordered the prime rib and it was fantabulous!  The meat was cooked to perfection, the green beans had just the right hint of garlic, and the potatoes were yummy as well!  Everyone's  food was spot on and I doubt that anyone would be disappointed  with anything  on the menu.  I had a specialty cake made for the evening (thank you CAKE Bakeshop in Manhattan Beach, Ca) that was incredible.   The staff graciously  offered to cut and serve the cake as well, even though they did not provide the dessert...what a great group of people!  Did I mention that there is a small stage and an Irish  duo plays most nights?  Entertainment,  food, and drinks...we couldn't  go wrong!  Ending the night listening to the lilting sounds of an Irish melody was the proverbial icing on the cake!  We had a great time and will definitely  go back again for a meal, or a pint!",

However like all restaurants that start good, changes in the menu to save costs and increase in the price result in a good thing becoming not so good. Food came out cold and soggy.  This restaurants desperation to over charge guests and cheat customers became evident my last time dining. While dining in a room separate from where the band was, the restaurant tried to impose an additional 10% fee for this annoying guy who can't even sing. Good luck with that. Staff are unhappy the manager is rude, and these visitors to our country need to go back to Ireland where this behavior in low customer service might be tolerated.    Used to be a regular local.  Avoid this pub if you expect respect, good service, or hot food.",

I had to drown my fish in vinegar and lemon juice and my wife took only one bite of her meatloaf. Oh...they also hit your bill with a 10% \"live entertainment\" tax even when you're not sitting in the room where it's played. Way to go Ri Ra!",

We, a party of six, waltzed in without a reservation on a weeknight and was able to get seated right away at about 7pm.   Pub wings (10.95) - pretty good but didn't change your life. You can get these in a Guinness BBQ sauce, Jameson honey glaze, mild, wild, or volcanic.   Publicans Reuben Sandwich ($13.95) - tons and tons of brisket. So delicious, but be prepared for a serious sandwich. Would prefer if they had a bread that could hold up the sandwich a bit better.   Shepard's Pie ($15.95) - the lamb was a bit salty. Nothing memorable.  Fish & Chips - very generous portion. Got the regular at $14.95, though there's a larger size too. Good, but nothing memorable.  Decent selection of brews, at the time they were offering a special of red beer mixed with lemonade (I think that was the combo). Delicious.  Service was just okay! There was live music and dancing, which was fun to observe. All in all, felt like the whole experience was a bit hokey, and for the price, I'm not sure I'd go back since there are so many other options in Vegas. Hmm....",

The food was just ok.  The boyfriend got the shepherd's pie and it was ok.  I tried the Kilbeggan Salmon and it was pretty delicious.  Appetizers were crab cakes and onion rings.  The crab cakes themselves were just alright, but the sauce that they put on them was awesome!  I really liked the onion rings - the were the tiny, thin cut onions and were super tasty.  Service was slow, but they were pretty busy and had only been open a couple of days, so I'll forgive it.  Our waiter (can't remember his name, but he was Irish) was super nice and chatty.

We stayed at the Luxor last week and discovered Ri Ra (along wtih the Guinness store next door) the first night as we wandered the walkway to Mandalay Bay.  Brand new, they said they'd opened 2 weeks ago.    It's got a good neighborhood pub feeling - even with the rowdies, come on! wouldn't be a pub without them.  They do a nice pour of Guinness and have Magner's cider on tap, my favorite go-to drink in a pub.  Hubby said the Reuben sandwich was the best he'd ever had and after I took a bite, heartily agreed.  We both had the lamb Shepherd's pie a few days later, very good as well.   Liked that they also offer the Cottage pie (beef instead of lamb).    Oh!  Music is a plus.  Monday night's band was lively and more modern, Wednesday night's duo was more traditional and subdued and I;d like to go back next time we're in Vegas.",

Is it like an Irish pub? Nope. Is it like an Americanized/Vegaszised Irish pup? Yep. Nothing wrong with that!  I had the beef stew and polished it off w/o help. My man had the sausage rolls appatizer and they were great as a meal if you want something a bit smaller than huge. Started with the chips and they were pretty authentic. Nice touch the mayo that includes the vinegar and salt already. Fish and chips looked great, but even the small portion scared me on size. All in all a great meal for a decent price. BTW valet your car at the Mandalay Bay shops and then just walk up the escalator and to the left. You'll be right there.",

He seemed to know his stuff.  When we did get our table, it was this awkward table that looked like it was in a walk way but there was absolutly no light shining on the table.   The only light that there was, was a tiny candle.  It felt like they just put atable because they coxuld, but they didn't want anyone else to know we were there at all.  But that wasn't really a problem.  We ordred tehe chicken wings and those are really good.  They are crispy and have the right amount of sauce.  I ordered the corn beef and cabbage and i thought it was pretty good.  My only complant was that the corned beef was cut with the grain rather than against, but no biggie still tasted good.  There were a cople of things that caught my eye, i will definietly come back for another meal.",

Also, this place had the largest cider selection I've ever seen. Lots of giant flat screens made this a great place to watch the playoffs. Get out of the casino and go here.",

We had two terrific meals here our last trip; a breakfast and a dinner. The traditional breakfast is a lot of food (all good, too). AT dinner I believe we had five different meals, and everyone was happy. Really enjoyed the selection of import beers, and the whiskey flights offered came at a very good price. We had good service both times, and also enjoyed the atmosphere and live music, in spite of the 10% tax. I fully plan to book my next hotel stay nearby just for ease of access to RiRa.",

    "text": "So, what is this!?  What is this awesomeness they call \"Guiness and Beef Stew\"!?  I mean, really?    And WHY haven't I tried it before.  God, it was excellent.    Anyway, we were in Vegas this past weekend and had an actual rare night to ourselves (me and the lady) so we went to look for food.  Our TAO reservations were for the day after and so we yelped what was good near the area.  Of course, Ri Ra popped up, and we liked the name, so we chanced it.  I was actually quite worried we wouldn't find the place, but it's actually easy to spot.  Just head down to the area between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  Then, look for the huge Guinness store.  It's part of/next to/permanently attached to the hip to Ri Ra.    So, anyway, I ordered the stew and she ordered the Fish and Chips.  She ordered some crazy drink, and I ordered some kind of Oktoberfest.  But, I wish now I grabbed a (insert blarney accent here) \"point\".  It'd go so good with the Stew.  Anyway, I'll give this place the four stars because of that stew.  She loved it.  I loved it.    It had this slight hint of the popular Irish pint.  But, I think it actually added more to the flavor because of its bitterness.  The beef was really soft, and though I'd rather have potato chunks, the mash was soft and delicious.  Service, for us anyway, was great.  They were attentive, though sometimes we'd go for fairly long stretches between checks.  Though, we were quite in the middle of conversation for most of the night, so I actually thought it was nice of them to leave mostly well enough alone.  Come here for the stew!  Good lord.  Now I gotta find a place in LA that serves that stuff even better!",

The one thing that bumped this up from being just a very good pub to a place to go back to was something very simple: The bread. We ordered a loaf to go LOL. It's a big heavy chunk of dark soda bread (I think that's what it's called). Really liked that. My guess it could be pretty raucous but when we were there, the noise level was well within tolerable limits. We were a little cramped but like I said, this is a pub. Definitely enjoyed it.

When my wife and I arrived around 8:45 PM, we were told the band would not start until after a fight on TV was over.  So instead of music, we had to endure a packed bar full of loud drunks watching a UFC fight.  This consisted of men and women bashing each other's brains to a bloody pulp.  Had I been informed of this change of events when I called  earlier, I could of (and wold have) rescheduled my visit.  Since we drove clear across town, we stayed and ordered food. The food was very good. The menu was very traditional Irish fare.  The beer and whiskey offerings were top notch as well.  The band did not come on until well after 10 PM and by 11 PM, we were too tired to stay and enjoy them.  Things went horribly wrong when the bill came.  I  questioned the server about a 20 ounce Guinness on the bill.  I asked her if she knew how many ounces were in a pint.  I received a Guinness in a pint glass.  She proceeded to argue with me that a pint was 20 ounces whilst I corrected her to say that a pint is 16 ounces.  She then tried to tell me that the other beer we ordered in a (different glass) was 16 ounces of beer.  That one in fact was 11.2 ounces which was clearly printed on the bottle it came in!  After that conversation her $20 tip was adjusted to $5 and I will not bring my friends from Ireland there when they visit later this year.  Also, beware the food and entertainment taxes they add on to the bill just because the place is on the strip!",

I also tried a few appetizer such as the potato cakes and the sweet potato fries which were also good.  But, I am obsessed with goat cheese and had to try the baked goat cheese appetizer.

We sat down, only wanted a few drinks before the concert. Our server was Amy, and she was great. Very nice, attentive, and the Irish accent was a plus.   I took off one star because Amy was about to end her shift so we closed our tab with her, but she said another server will be around in case we need anything. I wish I could've remembered his name because after she had left, not one time did that server come around to see if we needed anything else or if we wanted another drink.   Would I try this place again? Yes, because we found out that locals get 40% off on Fridays and their food smelt good as it came out of the kitchen.   I just suggest whoever is covering for a server after they leave, to make sure they make their rounds with people already sitting in their area.

The portion sizes are large and definitely shareable, which I'd recommend so you can try everything. This is my fave Irish pub in Vegas and California combined, the food seemed authentic and unique and did not lack in flavor. We were very happy but also were very full. I don't think we ate dinner that night (we had come in for an early lunch).",

The Kilcullen Omelet on the breakfast menu was tasty, and although the eggs were a bit over done, the corned beef was delicious and the potatoes on the side were seasoned perfectly.   For weekend brunch I had the Reuben and it was good overall, with a few pieces of corned beef being overdone. Loved the sauerkraut and the rye bread. My fiance loved his corned beef and cabbage.   Decent beers on draught and prices weren't too crazy (it is Vegas so high prices are to be expected). Will most definitely be back the next time I'm in town.",

Crispy, moist, a little greasy, foot long piece of battered cod on a pile of hand cut fries.  Fish and Chips.  A few splashes of malt vinegar and a pint or two of  GUINNESS, rooting for your team.  7pm.  Minced lamb sewed with carrots, leeks, wine and peas topped by a crisp crust of buttery mashed potatoes.  Shepherd's Pie with a pint or two of GUINNESS.  Dinner of champions.  9pm.  Live Irish music, a pint; before you know it, you'll have an Irish accent and are just another reveler in at the party!  One of the best pulled pints of Guinness outside Ireland (or another Ri Ra location).  Brewery fresh with rapid consumption, pulled through the ideal system designed by the brewery itself.  Perfect temp.  Creamy head,  The classic seven gulps, seven rings on the glass when you're done.  Outstanding selection of Irish whisky including some very difficult to find gems.  Solid list of brown libations.  Other Irish brews and a full bar to satisfy any drinking needs.  Outstanding service.  Very friendly.  Ultra high energy as the crowd swells during rugby and football matches and becomes standing room only during live entertainment.  True Irish pub atmosphere.  Critical Review:  1.  Breakfast - Stand out items, Irish breakfast (described above) and the banger or rasher sandwich.  Simply served on buttered white bread with a side of potatoes and a grilled tomato.  Simple and satisfying.  Skip the pancakes.  Crumbly and off taste.  2.  Food in general - If it sounds Irish, order it.  It's their forte and done well.  One exception, the burgers for lunch are outstanding.  Thick, juicy, huge, cooked to temp.  Try the dubliner with ground lamb.  Just remember, the Irish in Ireland don't eat corned beef and cabbage.",

    "text": "This Irish pub is a great restaurant to go to if you're in the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay. It is located in the walkway between Mandalay Bay and Luxor. I really appreciate how this Irish pub embodies the Irish culture, with the music and environment all fitting to the classic pubs I went to when I was in Dublin, Ireland. I believe our waitress even had an Irish accent!  I went with family and friends for dinner on Christmas. We went at 6:00, and we were the only table seated in our particular room. The waitress was probably anxious of the crowd of people that she was expecting in on Christmas night, but she was not the most friendly person during our interaction with her. She would lose her patience and give quick, short responses when we asked about different items on the menu. It seemed like she had somewhere to be afterwards and that we were wasting her time.  When we received our food, another waiter took the liberty of doing so. However, he would just place the dishes on the table without naming the dishes so we did not know whose orders were being delivered onto the table.   Overall, not very satisfied with the service.  We had a party of 10, so we ordered quite a few dishes.   Baked Goat Cheese: This plate was to die for!! If you are a cheese fanatic like myself, I would definitely recommend this appetizer. The goat cheese was extremely creamy, and absolutely perfect when you pair it with the red onion preserves, pepper relish, & walnut pesto.   Deviled Scotch Egg: It comes with 4. This was my first time having a deviled scotch egg. I normally don't like mayonnaise, so I was worried it would be like eating a mouthful of butter when I bit into the deviled scotch egg. But, it was very delicious!   Fish & Chips: This is quite a big order, so I would recommend sharing it with someone if you were to order this dish. The fries did not taste like fries! They were very flat with little potato inside of the fried portion. So I was very disappointed in the fries.  Mum's Meatloaf Burger: A beef/pork patty topped with mashed potato, cheddar, onions, and onion rings... all made into a burger. So basically a heart attack! It was absolutely delicious though. We ordered 3, and did not regret it.  Though we ordered a lot more, that is all for the foods that I was able to try out. I would try out this restaurant if you wanted to experience what it is like to be in an Irish Pub. I was personally not impressed by the service. But, it may have been because it was Christmas night and the waiters/waitresses were anticipating a busy night. The food may be expensive, but the portions are fairly large.",

My hubby was so happy with his beer so was I. For food, we just ordered chicken strips and for 1 dollar more you can make your order spicy, so we did that. The food was ok but it wasn't anything special. Our waiter on the hand was very polite and friendly. We left so happy and we might come back tomorrow to try their entrees.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for work and stopped by this bar hoping for a non-club atmosphere. The live band was great! They played a ton of songs that everyone knew and kept the crowd engaged with dancing.   The whiskey flights are hidden a little bit from the menu but they have a special ipad listing them. We did a whiskey flight and and two cocktails. The cocktails were vegas priced but well poured.   We ordered wings (half buffalo/half barbecue). My boyfriend is well versed in BBQ sauce and to his surprise, the BBQ sauce was amazing. He even said the best one he may have ever had.   The only reason for the -1 star is a minor customer service issue. I understand we are in Vegas so people are probably drunkly spilling drinks all the time. But this was not my circumstances. I had ordered a double vodka soda ($23) and had a few small sips before knocking it all over the bar. We were sitting at the bar, sitting in front of the bartenders when this happened, and I was not offered a napkin or help cleaning. Instead, they chatted as I tried to mop up my entire drink with a few paper napkins I found.  Also, the full price of this drink was still on my check.  It would be one thing if I was drunk, but in this case, it was my clumsy mistake. I never send things back so I didn't bring up the price thing but it would have been a nice gesture to offer to make me even half of a new one. It was Tito's Vodka.... so I don't think at 23$ for two shots that would have been a huge deal.",

My favorite part of the meal was the medley of potatoes. There were sweet, purple and gold potatoes all perfectly cooked together.   Steak and Eggs  The cook messed up one of the two over easy eggs. The steal was good, it was cooked to order. The potatoes were still fantastic on this plate.   Service:  Friendly but slow. Food came out fast.

Present and delicious were the brown bread, salmon, sausage rolls and reuben sandwich. Guinness on tap was smooth as silk. For Vegas the prices seemed entirely reasonable. Service was friendly and attentive. The expansive bar is lively with party people so go early if you want a little less noise.

Authenticity of the ambiance comes through with each seemingly minor decoration detail that accumulates to make for an experience akin to being in Belfast or Dublin (we went to both in the spring of 2015).  Fourth star: Service. Prompt attention from our server, Graham, who not only exhibited extended knowledge about an extensive drink menu but comforted with his good sense of humor as well.  Fifth star: Food.  Reuben sandwich with a side salad was of perfect proportion so that one wouldn't nod off when returning to a conference after lunch.  Although not every bar in the U.S. serving Guinness on draft has been personally experienced, it's hard to imagine their pour not making it into the nation's final four.  How can you be sure this place was truly liked? During our short Vegas stay we visited it 3 times.  Should you not prefer sandwiches, then the fish and chips are really as good as advertised.  If Yelp allowed for a sixth star, then Ri Ra would earn it with the Black Donnelly's live performance that didn't need a silky pint to enjoy.",

I don't remember our waiters name but she was very kind and helpful. Service was very fast as well, which is a huge plus when you're starving!  Decor - ordinary \"Irish\" looking pub - red leather, wooden accents and even a live band. Definitely a beautiful place to eat at.   Food - stupendous!  1. Scotch Devil Eggs - SO YUMMY! The eggs were fried to perfection and taste delicious.  2. Chicken Wings - 1lb of wings! Can't beat that. The wings were meaty and well cooked and seasoned.  3. Honey Goat Cheese - A MUST! Goat cheese has an acquired taste but with the yummy honey touch, it was perfect. Served with a few slice of crisp bread and wow it hit the stop.   If you're at the Mandalay Bay or nearby, visit this pub! You will love it.",

    "text": "5 stars for their fish and chips!  I love fish and chips and Ri Ra has my favorite in Vegas. They use haddock vs. cod which to me is more flavourful than cod. There isn't a lot of batter, it's crispy on the outside (and still juicy even though it's a thinner piece of fish), and their chips are perfect (I usually do not eat chips/ fries and I ate all of them!). Plus you get a pretty big piece of fish!   Ri Ra also offers traditional pub fare like corned beef, Irish breakfast (all day), bangers, beef stew, and shepherd's pie. If you are not into those, you can always get a burger, wings, a salad, steak, or any of their other entrees - I just really love the fish and chips.   If you love desserts, save room for either the bread pudding with whiskey caramel sauce or the Bailey's chocolate pie.  They have a pretty big dining room and service can take a while (seems like the times that I have gone it has been super busy but they don't have a lot of servers working) - it's always friendly and attentive enough for me as I am rarely in a hurry when enjoying a good meal!  Definitely one of my favorites on the strip. Wish parking was free though!",

It was very late or early and tons of the restaurants were closed. It was probably around 1am. We walked nonstop until we found something decent enough and had choices for everyone since there were for of us with different tastes. Right when we were about to give up and settle for fast food I saw this area and was sold.   There was no wait so we were seated out back just pass the area where the live performer was singing.   I decided to get the English breakfast because all the alcohol I drank needed all that goodness to cling to. There's no better time to have breakfast than at 1am in Vegas.   The butter was sooooooo good. And I have no idea what type of bread that was, but I could eat it everyday for the rest of time. I cleared the whole plate like a champ.",

It feels like a place to either hang with your friends testing out every beer possible on the long list of selections or just bring the family to have a great meal  I dove into the Guinness BBQ Burger, and this bad boy ain't no joke.    First, plan on going full anaconda and unhinging your jaw to take each bite.  You can see in the pic the mega stack that is delivered.  Fortunately, it's not all show.  It really brings the flavor.  In fact, it's a top 10 burger of all time for me.    Note... I am a burger snob and don't offer that praise without real consideration.  Of course, if you have ever read any of my other reviews, you would know that I am big child and must have dessert anywhere I go.  I went with the bread pudding.  In honor of the St Louis Blues who just won the Stanley Cup about ten minutes ago... this is one H-E- double hockey stick of a great Bread Pudding!    If you are wandering the shops behind the Mandalay Bay, do yourself a favor and try this place!",

We pretty much had that area to ourselves, with couches, an old school looking TV that was playing the very old school batman show (i.e., the POW, ARGH, caption), there were various framed pictures of bands in that lounge area as well.    We ordered the MacNean tea for 2 and I must say that I did enjoy the tea sandwiches here more than the Tea Lounge.  The goat cheese walnut pesto was so flavorful, followed by the coronation chicken mini burgers.  These 2 were the faves for us.  The open faced salmon on wheat though is good, I didn't care for the wheat bread.  We didn't really get to taste the ham and caramelized onion sandwich because our toddler ate all the ham.  The raisin scones were hot and fresh, and tasted good with the fresh cream and jam.  I was so full by the time I ate half of the scone.  There were four dessert on the top tier to be shared by us.  Our favorite of the four was the raspberry jelly roll.  We each took a bite of the lemon tart, napoleon, and the coconut macaroon.    Although the tea selection was limited, they do offer bottomless tea and that we can switch out for a different pot of tea if we want.  I am happy with my green tea selection.  Service was wonderful the entire time.",

    "text": "The food was almost all excellent.   The entertainment was LOUD but good.   They did a great job of recreating an Irish pub in Vegas (except I don't remember any pubs being that big or that loud). They even got the right wood for the external facade!  The internal decor was fun, too (although the masks seemed more Venetian to us).  They lost a star because of the waitress- she couldn't recommend anything for the appetizer or entree. And when I asked for help choosing between 2 desserts, she said to go with the chocolate one- they were BOTH chocolate.  Also, the description on the dessert I went with specified it was going to be made with whipping cream, but it was most definitely made with Cool Whip (there's a clear taste difference), and since I'm allergic to Cool Whip, it really made a difference. Unfortunately I'd already gotten a big spoonful in before I realized it because I'd trusted the written description on the menu.",

    "text": "Hands down the best Irish food & historic pub I have ever been to.  My bf is from Ireland so I know. From the ceiling to the floors, menu, people, live music, posters, even St. Patrick, authentic from Ireland shipped in multiple ships & orchestrated into the original bar by the best architects.    Scott gave us a full tour as we waited for our perfect proper homemade Irish breakfast.  All made from scratch to the point of us coming back the next evening for dinner & the live Irish band that started around 8:45pm.  From Rashers, pudding, sausage & corned beef all made specifically by Ri Ra.    A+ & mmm mmm delicious! All day Irish Breakfast.  The best sausages I have ever had.    App's The BEST Deviled Scotch Eggs ever!  Deviled eggs wrapped in Rashers then Panko like Crusted, cut in halves then deviled w/ mayo.  OMG!   Sausage Rolls... puff pastry wrapped sausages were also OMG!    Dinner We split the beautiful house made Corned Beef, Cabbage & Mashed Potatoes that we're out of this world.  Even the Food Network couldn't get this so perfect.   Dessert The most delish Bread Pudding w/ freshly whipped cream & amen to no raisins.  We had our server pick our dessert & she was spot on.  Trust me if you start w/ everything I mentioned you will not be disappointed.    Two pints of Guinness gets you $ off Uber as well.  They sell things we buy from our Irish market in Kentucky & cute shirts & have a store next door.  Totally impressed & can't wait for next time!  Thank you staff & Scott for welcoming us as you did.",

I frequent Las Vegas for work, and while I like the city, there is only so much I can take.  The slot machine sounds drive me insane.  Whenever I'm in Vegas by myself, or with coworkers, we usually stay at Mandalay, and probably hit this place 2-3 times a day.  Their full Irish Breakfast is incredible, the fish and chips are great, and the Guinness stew is inexpensive and awesome.  All of the food I've had has been very good.  They've got great taps, and a great selection of whiskey.  The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere makes it feel like you're in a 100 year old pub.  Later at night, there are plenty of friendly strangers to chat with.",

    "text": "When my husband (then fiance) and I were planning our out-of-state wedding in Las Vegas, I have to admit I was nervous. I got several quotes from various casinos, restaurants on the strip, and restaurants off the strip and I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon RiRa while perusing the Mandalay instill among their team, affordable prices (we held a lunch wedding reception in the Parlour Room for 55 people and it was beyond fantastic), flexibility, and delicious food, there's not much else to love!!   When I was on the Mandalay Bay website. I was immediately drawn in by the Pub Lunch, but it's not only the price that you'll love about RiRa. It's more like what's not to love about RiRa? Aside from the amazing customer service that Scott and Paula exhibit, they worked tirelessly to ensure that our special event unfolded just as my husband and I desired; they communicated clearly and within 24 hours - they answered their phones! I can't tell you how many venues didn't even respond to our emails, let alone in a timely manner! This was never the case at RiRa.   Paula's impeccable attention to detail went above and beyond what we had expected. She and her team even went as far as to set up and decorate our reception room so we didn't have to worry about it! I mean, who does that?? That's BRILLIANT customer service. Her concern was that we didn't have to worry about a single thing on our Big Day.   We had our cake delivery scheduled and Paula even offered to pick it up, since the bakery was actually in the Mandalay Bay lobby (our bakery forgot to mention this and Paula tried to help us out here); she said she could just take a quick walk over and get it so we didn't have to pay the delivery fee.  Everything from the decorations, lighting, music, microphone available, food, service, etc. was amazing. We feel like RiRa is now a part of our Las Vegas tradition and so every time we celebrate there, we'll be sure to come in and feast on the delicious salmon, potato and leek soup, and corned beef!  If you're planning a wedding, look no further - seriously. You will not be disappointed - the venue is beautiful and a photographer's dream. If you're planning a party, look no further! If you just want a delicious meal or ice cold beer, look no further. Scott, Paula, and RiRa's staff are so on top of their game - anyone who chooses not to stop by, is truly missing out!",

The decor and atmosphere smacked of fairly traditional Irish pubs--warm woods and inviting paint colors--with the only difference being the sky-high ceiling height.  Food was solid and decently priced.  I'll always like a spot that has Smithwicks on tap.  Service was great, too.  Would recommend this spot for anyone trolling the Strip.",

The soda bread was excellent and I could have eaten more but didn't want to fill up. I had the potato cakes appetizer which was two large cakes with a vinaigrette sauce.  It was very tasty, it could have been a little crisper, but it did have a light fluffy texture.  For my main course I had the fish and chips.  The fish was light and flaky and the coating was crisp.  You only get one piece of fish but it was a decent size and after the ceasar salad, soda bread and  potato cakes, it was more than enough.  The fries were about the only negative about the meal, limp and soggy.    Ri Ra was a nice surprise and was a good place to watch the hockey games.",

We decided to be a little adventurous and try the scotch deviled eggs as an appetizer and they were DIVINE.  Seriously... so good.  Try them!   My reuben was also really good --  made with real corned beef instead of the sliced deli \"meat\" you usually get on a reuben.  Our curry fries were also pretty tasty. Everything was a bit pricey, but that's what you get when you're down on the Strip.  When we weren't ready to order at her first attempt, our server took a very long time to come back and get our order, but other than that ... she did a great job. Answered all our questions in a friendly way, refilled our waters before our glasses were empty and kept our table nice and neat.  Can't ask for much more than that!  Good job, Ri Ra!",

Seriously, the carbonation or whatever had run out, not an auspicious start!   Ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, which was ok.  Ordered the fish and chips (the smaller size EASILY satisfied both the wife and myself, no arguing that the portion size is generous).  The fish was tasty, the fries a bit greasy, but hey, this is pub fare after all.   So food, not bad.  Not fantastic, but par for the course. It was the \"entertainment\" that soured our evening.   There was some kind of singing duo up on the stage at the far end of the establishment.  When we were seated, we asked to be as far from the \"band\" as possible, which brought critical looks from our hostess.  Turns out we weren't nearly far enough away.  These two guys singing were horrible.  My wife and I are both musicians, we know what wrong notes sound like, and we heard PLENTY of them.  If this is what passes for \"live Irish entertainment\" then they need to offer earplugs at the door.",

The live music is a bit loud if you're in the main area (not really suitable for talking), but the back room is quieter.   The food is decent. Nothing to rave about, but the portions are good and prices are affordable (which is a big deal in Vegas).   Just be aware that they charge a live entertainment tax, which I didn't know - so the bill goes up unexpectedly.",

To eat we had the meatloaf burger, which was pretty good, and the smoked salmon club, which was great, but the story line to this place is 150 or so whiskey bottles hanging around the shelves and cabinets.  From $650 a shot down to $8, they have pretty much everything.  They have a great catalog at the bar detailing what they have available, and that alone was great to enjoy.  Wondered if I could somehow get it out of there, but thought better of it.  :-)  The only thing that kept it from five stars, and this probably sounds petty, most of the bartenders had NO idea about the whiskies.  In a bar like this, with that as one of their points of pride, seems like they'd give the staff some training beyond \"here's the book\", but it's not like that'll keep me from going back next time we're in Vegas.",

In fact, it was a negative experience.  The barkeep recommended the fish and chips. They were well rated here on yelp, so I went with them.  IMHO - poor. The chips were Blah. The fish started ok (first, hot bite) and went sharply downhill from there. There was a strip of skin/bone I could not cut - ran down the entire length of fish. Peeling the meat away caused me to loose most of the breading. The fish alone tasted watery - like something frozen, thawed, and left to sit in condensate for hours before going into the pot. Pretty greasy, even for fried fish.   Note - I got the mashed peas - a $5 side dish, thinking it would be a healthy addition. I could not eat. Tasted like a dirty diaper. And I can eat just about anything. I even hit it with Tabasco but it ruined the Tabasco.   One star for bar with soccer. 0 stars for food.",

A few rounds of Guinness, Mum's meatloaf and a basket filled with a mixture of BBQ / spicy buffalo wings.. all served up while watching that epic Seahawks vs. Packers playoff game on an enormous TV in a restaurant / bar filled with die hard football fanatics.. a slight tear was shed, a little beer poured for the homies, hugs & high fives were exchanged and an extraordinary time was being had by everyone in Ri Ra that day.   Mum's meatloaf is served sandwich style.. which is fine. I prefer to have my meatloaf in between two buns. OOOOH! BADABOOM! All jokes aside, this thing is a heap of loaded goodness. Not only is your everyday ground beef up in this loaf; Pork, veal, mashed potato, whiskey seared onions, Guinness ketchup and some beer battered onion rings. When a sandwich has that juicy, salty crunch mixed with a mound of flavor packed meat.. you, my friend, have yourself the perfect pub sandwich.   The wings were the perfect compliment to this feast of a sandwich. They claimed the spicy would be out of this world 'hot'.. though, it barely trickled a sniffle from my snout. No biggie, as the wings were buffalo style and the 'hot' buffalo sauce was still tasty. The BBQ sauce was smothered on the other half, and that sweet tangy flavor could be smelled from a mile away.. More like feet, cause the kitchen wasn't too far from our seats. Mix the BBQ with the hot and you're swimming in Buffalo wing heaven.   The ambiance is True pub. It felt like, at any moment, an old Irish folk song would be sung and belted out as everyone held their Guinness filled mugs in air. This was wishful thinking, but the environment (staff, decor, drinks, food) all screamed great craic! Ri Ra is the perfect spot to kick back a few, watch a game and grub and some goodies. One of the better 'pubs' in the Vegas area, for sue.",

My Husband and I went there yesterday for some drinks and to watch the baseball game. We are not from here so when we got there the \"hostess\" (she should just be called a mannequin or useless cuz she didn't do anything! or even greet us!), finally we caught her eye and we told her we just wanted drinks. She told us \"ok walk all the way to the back past the restaurant and have a seat anywhere in the bar section\".   Per the Hostess' instructions we did just that, we sat down and no one greeted us or looked at us or came up to us. So many servers walked by us and ignored us.  Finally a blonde server came out from the back and my husband caught her attention and she told us  with an obvious annoying tone in her voice \"if you want service you have to tell the hostess, and first of all this table is dirty so you know you are not even suppose to sit here? if u want to sit here you have to tell the hostess or you sit at the bar\".   How the fuck are we suppose to know? The gothic hostess told us to walk to the back ourselves, how are we suppose to know the operations of the restaurant? We took her description as the front was the restaurant and when you walk through the door the back was the bar section.  I thought that was RA RA IRISH PUB's job to train them to let them know to seat Guests, not have the Guests just knowwwwww the rules and where to sit. Do you need us to do research on the servers and just know who has how many tables thus far so we know where to sit?   My Husband and I got so irritated we just left, when we walked up to the front we saw the gothic hostess with the pink hair and 2 other servers standing at the hostess station goofing off. One picked up the other server and was twirling them around in the air like a little kid and the hostess even had the nerve to tell us to have a good day. I wanted to tell them to go fuck themselves, FIRST IMPRESSION OF VEGAS CUZ WE JUST GOT OFF THE PLANE! WORST SERVICE EVER!  Low class service, we should have just went straight to our hotel at the Aria! at least the workers at Aria are not goofing off and twirling themselves in the air!",

The tea manager came out and sat with us to plan our big event coming up. She also was easy to work with and offered us a variety of tea menus.

I always have the fish and chips so I can't speak for the other food, but from what I see on other tables it all looks good. The fish and chips are amazing with a huge hunk of Halibut and beautiful fries. This is enough for 2 or 3 people. The ambiance is great and the wait staff are always very nice. The music is always great too. It just doesn't get any better than Ri Ra's.",

It is always Irish themed music, but not just traditional jigs & what not.  The first time I came here, The Blaggards were doing some traditional song.  I took a quick break.  When I came back, they were doing Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads!  I haven't heard that in a while & was stoked!  Most of the bands will do Irish folk, country, & some Irish based rock bands like U2, the Pogues, Dropkick Murphys, etc.  Drink prices, specifically beer & cider are actually good for a joint in the Mandalay.  They'll have a cocktail of the month. This month is a Blackberry Mojito (for May).  It is meh, but, I am not a huge mojito fan.  I've done an Irish Whiskey flight and that was great & cheap.  $12 for 4 2oz shots of increasing quality.    I've had some food.  For sure, their Irish Curry is great with chips (fries).  I would love to come for dinner, but I seem to only make it here on Tuesday nights.  The  service is friendly & fast, the ambiance is great with a private bar/room to the left of the stage & dining behind the bar/stage area.  If you need a more quiet spot, sit near the storefront & the sound isn't loud, in my opinion.  Soon, I may have a teacher for Irish jigs, & step dancing.  That'll be a sight, a 6'1\" Flip, wearing a tie dyed v-neck, step dancing to Seven Drunken Nights!",

    "text": "Not sure whats happening at Ri Ra? Seems to be slipping and all quality controls are being cast aside. This is one of my favorite watering holes and comfort food spots here in Las Vegas. Always try to visit it before any concert at Mandalay Bay. Also like to bring out of town visitors here. Unfortunately, the past two experiences have been sub par.   This past Saturday night we brought in a group of out of town guests to pregame before the 311 concert. The goat cheese appetizer is amazing and we always order it. They give you a heaping amount of goat cheese and other tasty spreads. They also only give you 5 small pieces of what look like a dry toast (melba toast maybe?). The 5 small slices are not enough. When you ask for more, they charge you money. Granted it's only a few dollars. But it feels like they are nickle-and-diming you. Especially when you have already ordered drinks and are waiting for your entrees. Not like we are sitting down to eat free toast and nothing else. Live in Vegas, work in the industry and have never seen a place on or off the strip charge for additional bread. It's just tacky.   I ordered the Alaskan salmon entree. When it came out it was circular in shape, similar to a salmon burger. It sat on a bed of lettuce and was surrounded by some potatoes. The potatoes were dry and I had issues trying to swallow them. The salmon was super fishy and it tasted like the fish had started to decompose. I took another bite to see if it was my pallet and it too was fishy and gross. I suspect it was a salmon burger that had been previously frozen. It was not fresh. I sent it back and asked for fish and chips. Our server then informed me that they were going to discontinue that salmon entree in a few weeks. I suspect that others had also complained and sent it back. Salmon is a staple, it's easy to cook, it should not be circular like a hamburger patty.   The fish and chips was OK. It was a bit greasier then I remember it being. The chips (fries) were also over-cooked and dry. At this point I had given up and turned my focus on catching a proper buzz prior to the concert.   Our server was new to Ri Ra and she was very friendly. She kept us hydrated and we ran our bill up to almost $300 in the hour we were there (mostly drinks). I hope the management team takes notice and works towards correcting these issues. We will be back, and hopefully we get to experience the Ri Ra we fell in love with long ago.",

To be honest, a few if us wondered what they were thinking going from a small but elegant ceremony to an Irish Pub. As soon as we walked back to the private room, any doubts we had were gone.   The fireplace and decor of the room made it seem like an intimate dinner party rather than a bar reception. The Irish themed appetizers were hot, tasty, and provided a nice change from veggie plates and chips and dip. Having super-charming bar staff with adorable Irish accents (who cares if they are really authentic?) added such a fun element to the party.   Service was on par with nicer restaurants in Vegas, and no one in our party ever went without food or drink. After the cake was cut, it was expediently whisked away, only to return in portions to eat right there, or packaged up for later. The extra apps were wrapped up, along with extra cake, and sent to the Bridal Suite for late night snacking.   The entire staff was overwhelmingly gracious, and in a town where they see so many weddings every day, it was great to feel like they were only interested in ours.  If you're getting hitched in Vegas, especially anywhere near the Mandalay Shops, give Ri Ra a chance as your reception or even just cocktail hour spot.",

    "text": "I'd say that this is the second-best Irish pub in Vegas, which is not to say that it's anything other than a great place to dine, drink, and have a bit of craic (which, incidentally, is the Irish word for fun, enjoyment, and fellowship). The only place I found that beat it out is McMullan's, a free-standing joint near the Orleans Hotel & Casino a bit west of the strip on Tropicana. This one beat Nine Fine Irishmen in the New York New York for the number 2 spot on my list. The food is fantastic, the ambience is spot-on, and although the place is a smaller than the Nine Fine Irishmen, it has a more authentic feel to it (especially since you can sit at the bar and be within arm's reach of the stage). The service is top-notch, and we were well-taken-care-of during all our visits. The bartenders and servers are always on top of whether you might need another pint, and willing to offer their own suggestions of what to try next. They have a surprising number of different libations available, from the ubiquitous Guinness, Smithwick's and Harp on tap to a variety of different Irish ciders I'd never even heard of in bottles. I was very glad to try some new things to compliment old favorites, and I can't recommend asking what special offerings they currently feature enough. Try something new. Live a little, and enjoy the craic. I was really surprised one night when we popped in for a pint that Derek Warfield and the Young Wolfe Tones were playing. \"Live Music\" is all the sign said, and I about fell off my bar stool when I saw who it was. I was a little miffed that they hadn't really advertised his presence, though I found out that not a lot of people who had come in for \"live Irish music\" that night knew, either, so I suppose that their target demographic isn't the most knowledgeable about Irish music. I can't really complain because I got to see them play on a lark without a huge thronging crowd getting in the way, so I'll definitely drop in for a pint again when I come back through town.",

Get the mussels to share because it's a lot of food & see if you can get some extra bread ordered to sop up the goodness.",

    "text": "I actually made it out of The Tropicana by 8am for my morning walk this past Sunday. Impressed? You should be, as it was a tough go the 1st 100 yards or so, and it was already in the mid 90's. After a mile or 2 I doubled back to Mandalay Bay in search of a Bloody Mary. Whaaaat? Its Vegas damn it. Walked around the casino to discover the bars were not yet open at nearly 9am. Hey! I thought this was Vegas not Des Moines.  I decided to take the air conditioned route through the mall thing that stretches through a couple of hotels and drops one directly across from \"The Trop.\" Panic started to creep in as I passed a few more shuttered restaurants. Wait, someone up ahead opening their doors for business. Is it a clothing store or..?? OMG, its an Irish Pub. I thought the heat was affecting me and I was dreaming a desperate dream.  Sure enough, 9am sharp and these Angels of Mercy were beckoning me towards the flashy bar. Some slick looking kat with (presumably) an Irish accent welcomed me like a long lost mate. Feeling better already.  My new mate Tom made me a killer Stoli Mary, and soon some fellow dehydrated patrons showed up and it turned into your typical neighborhood Irish bar kinda place. Yeah, right here in Fauxville Vegas. Especially unexpected in this mall tunnel thingy.   My intention was a one n done, but my other new mates seated next to me ordered some delicious looking breakfasts, and I was soon requesting that menu that I previously returned to Tom. He recommended the Irish Eggs Benedict, which listed Rashers as an ingredient, and he informed it was the Irish version of Canadian bacon. I just looked it up and found this definition: \"Rashers (n): pieces of bacon; female genitalia.\"  Ahem, think I will move on without further comment.   I also looked up Ri-Ra (n): Irish expression for fun and excitement.  Great breakfast, great service, great vibe. If ever on this boring end of the strip, this is a must do.",

I thought it would be a lot more creamier than this.  But then, I never have one before.  Servers are all very nice and friendly.  No obnoxious or drunk crowd.  Foods are okay.

We meet the nicest people visiting from Ireland. I received my first girl on girl kiss unexpectedly after taking shots of Irish Whiskey but it was fun. Even the Manager was dancing and passing out shots. BEST ST. Patty's Day ever!",

They gave a corner; we had a few of us. Nice high back seating. Ambience had us feeling like we were Ireland, including the names and accents of the servers. Lol. Brian and Sean (Irish a bit ya think)? took care of our party. Sean was in training and did very well. We asked for recommendations and were treated with the goodness! We started with potato cakes... you'll never have them this good. Garnished with greens and a vinegarette....awesome tastes! I ordered a Rueben, the wife, fish n chips. Both great and both recommended by our server. The others in our party ordered a pub burger, tuna melt, and buffalo chicken sandwich. Everyone was pleased and thought that the food tasted really authentic. Tuna melt was a chunk of seared fillet NOT TUNA SALAD...nice difference. Buffalo sauce was tasty and the burger cooked just like he liked it. Def a nice lil joint to stop for a burger/sandwich and a dark beer. You'll forget you're in Vegas!",

They have a delicious selection of whiskey from around the globe as well as a variety of different flights that you can order to sample of their wares. The staff here are energetic and dedicated, they told me about their World Record for longest music set, at 17 days they were able to continuously have bands play different songs in front of at least 4 audience members at any given time!   The food is very tasty, I wouldn't rant and rave and toss Michelin stars at it, but for some of Ireland's finest mashes, meat dishes, and sauces, I'd come here.   The decor is nice, showcasing their whiskey's all over the bar area, with the coveted finest whiskey behind the bar - they told me a story that someone bout a round of the $300 a dram whiskey for about 10 people... and one of them, just shot it. As an avid whiskey drinker I have been in the presence of those who are uneducated in the ways of whiskey and please note that if you want to \"shoot\" some whiskey, there's a few great dives where you can scoot your boots and toss back some of Tennessee's finest.  I have yet to enjoy a show here, but it sounds like a hoot. I'll be here for a few weeks this year and I think I'll be making my frequent stops here.  Authentic, relaxed, and plentiful.  Enjoy!",

There is a great big room with a projector when I went to watch the World Cup 2018 and it was a cool little experience with all the people who came to watch from all over.

The ambience, the food, the service were all top notch.   The ambience - the place is big, but doesn't feel big. One thing I really liked was the party feel. Yes, it was loud. We were seated next to a few large groups. But to me, that's the joy of a pub. The smells, the food, the conversation.   The food - couldn't ask for anything better. I ordered the McDonnell Irish Curry over 1/2 rice and 1/2 fries. Delish.  My wife ordered the Fish & Chips (minus the chips). The fish was the best we've ever had. And it was HUGE! Instead of chips, she ordered the Brussels Sprouts & Bacon. Also delish.   The service - our waitress was amazing. She took really good care of us and was very pleasant to work with.   Next time you're in Vegas, please give this place a try. There's plenty on the menu to choose from, so you can't go wrong.",

Our waiter was awesome and as our food arrived it looked absolutely delicious, till we took a bite out of it.  We had the bangers and smash which looked great but when we ate the sausages they were literally burnt half way through.  One of the other dishes we had which was like a breaded sausage and for the life of me I can't remember the name.. that was also burnt half way through.  We all didn't want to make a big deal out of it so we ate what we could so we weren't late for the Michael Jackson show. I do however look forward to coming back another time to try the food and change my review.",

The waiter was really great and definitely had \"service with a smile\". He recommended the potato cakes, and the fish and chips which were, in his words, the \"best in Vegas\". I thought at the time... bad thing to hype up the expectations.... HE WAS RIGHT!! Those fish and chips were crazy good. A huge piece of fish, which you might think would be hard to cook, but was remarkably tender, with the best thin and crispy batter. Also came with crispy In-n-out looking fries that worked perfectly in the dish. They also had malt vinegar on the side and a really tasty, tartar sauce that rivaled any I've ever tasted. That being said, the potato cake was ok, but not something I'd get again. The potatoes were a little creamier that I would have liked, the texture seemed a little off. Flavor was good overall, but not amazing. I will definitely be back for those fish and chips. SOOO GOOD.",

    "text": "I was in town for a conference and some coworkers asked us to meet them here for dinner. I'll be honest, based on the name I had zero clue where I was going or what type of cuisine I was in store for that evening. But, alas, I was pleasantly surprised. The place was crazy busy but we were early and settled in with a beer. They have an excellent beer selection.   For dinner I ordered a chicken dish, that I can't seem to find on their online menu. But it was warm and comforting. The chicken was pan friend over mashed potatoes and veggies. It was home cooking done right with just enough elegance that made it feel special. I honestly gobbled it up because it was so scrumptious. When walking through the restaurant, it is easy to spot what the crowd pleasing meal is: fish and chips. This is not your ordinary fish and chips though. It is literally a whole fried fish. It is so big it hangs off the edge of the plate just enough that it doesn't fall off. Everyone raved about their dish. My girlfriends got the Shepherd's Pie, which was surprisingly small in portion size in comparison to all the other meals, but they said it was filling and fine enough to share amongst two people.   When leaving, there was a live Irish band playing and the place was packed with what appeared to be True Irishmen. This is not your average Irish Pub, it appears to be a home away from home for some and a great place to sneak away to when you want to escape Vegas and feel like your are in the green countryside of Ireland.",

There was an Irish band playing, and they were fun.  There's a cute little bar area off to the left with banquettes and easy chairs -- and a giant TV, if there's a game on you want to watch.

    "text": "I have rarely met an Irish Pub (in Ireland or elsewhere) that I did not like and believe me, I tried to like this Ri Ra location, as I love the Charlotte, NC and Arlington, VA versions. Sadly, it failed on several counts and was- at least the time I visited - another example of some places on the Strip that send out the vibe, \"We cater to tourists and don't necessarily expect to see you again, awesome experience or not.\"  I was there with a party of three and two of us had been to other Ri Ra pubs. So we were very much looking forward to a high level of service, Irish authenticity and awesome food. We got the authenticity (Irish accents, Gaelic menu items and Guinness served at just the right temperature) but the other two aspects were lacking.   To service: We waited for 15-20 minutes (in a 1/2-full restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, so not really busy) to get our order taken and then some 15 minutes thereafter were told that one of our entrees was out and we'd need to choose another. So 40 minutes in, we received the food (in fairness and to the server's credit we were not charged for the replacement entree.) But until the food came, other wait staff and our own waiter rushed past, ignoring eye contact and giving us the feeling that they'd get to us eventually.  To food: The quality was not up to the standards of other Ri Ra locations- in terms of presentation and also in ingredients- and the portion size was also smaller than what I knew from other locations. Also, because of the wait for the one entree, the other two were served lukewarm, i.e. it was clear they'd been prepared and sat while the other entree was cooked later.   There are plenty of good Ri Ra's across this great land and several good Irish Pubs on the Strip, but for now, the Ri Ra in Vegas isn't on our list for a return visit for a while.",

There were several times where I was caught looking at the neighbor's plate, but I could not take my eyes off the enormous piece of fish and the bounty of chips that came with his order. If I was not trying to be good after my Chinatown voyage, earlier in the day, I would have ordered it in a heartbeat. Instead, I went against the no salad at bars rule and ordered the chop chop ($13.95). The large chunks of avocado, halved cherry tomatoes, diced chicken, red onions, and mixed greens normally come with bleu cheese crumbles and a mustard vinaigrette. I asked for without either and subbed the champagne vinaigrette instead and it was magnificent. Stole a bite of a friend's steak and hand cut fries ($24.95). The steak was beautiful, thick and came with sauteed mushrooms and onions. The hand cut fries were a let down, coming out limp and soggy. The process of thievery continued on to another friend's sausage rolls ($9.95) and they were impressive. The sausage was moist and flavorful while the bread had the buttery flakiness of a croissant. For the price listed above you get two rolls and my friend who eats like a bird polished them off.",

After dinner, we came here and had a blast. The band played a song for us so we could have our first dance, and we drank Guinness and just hung out. Our photographer and videographer really liked the stylish settings, although the lighting was difficult. But overall, Ri Ra was a great place with great people. And great food - we came here on another visit to Vegas and had dinner. I LOVE the fish & chips. :-) We will definitely be visiting again.",

The food is decent, however, it is not traditional Irish food, it is more Irish food with an American twist. The bangers were not quite right(not sure if they were actually real bangers), which kind of threw off the taste of the sausage rolls. Still the food was good.  One thing I that kind of shocked me was the 'live entertainment tax' which kind of sucked since it was almost $5. I have never payed that here in CA, so I wasn't expecting it.   The 'Irish band' was also a tad disappointing, they played many American songs, and not a lot of folk songs like I was expecting. They all were great musicians though and had great voices.   Overall not a bad pub, reminded me a lot of the pubs of Southern Ireland.",

I also tried the shot of CHOCOLATE CAKE (Absolut Vanilia, Frangelico) - pretty darn good and tasted just like warm chocolate cake!  Service was fast, friendly and with a smile.  Ri Ra (translated means celebration and good fun) is located in Mandalay Bay -  this places is a total Irish Pub!   They have live music on weekends (that's what the sign said outside...)  This pub is right next to the Guiness Merchandise Store.  I'd definitely come and eat here again, they had a ton of stuff on their menu that I would like to try!",

    "text": "Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I'm no stranger to an Irish pub. In fact, I'm a regular pub snob, as my husband is 100% born and raised in Ireland, and I've spent a good amount of my time in pubs. Some good, some bad, some mediocre. And I know it's a chain, but I LOVE this Ri Ra.  After a stressful week spent in meetings, the minute I got to Vegas all I wanted to do was unwind. My coworker knows I love a good pub, and was familiar with Ri Ra, so she suggested we go get a drink. I could still hug her for that! When I stepped in, Ri Ra felt like home. Irish staff and bartenders, dim lighting, lots of dark wood, and an all around great atmosphere. There's even a statue of St. Patrick holding a pint! Love it. (Oh, and this pub is HUGE, btw - if you don't like the area you're sitting in, go exploring into another room, and you're bound to find a space that makes you happy.)  So, we sat at the bar, I knocked back a couple of Jameson & Diet Cokes (not too overly expensive for Vegas, either), and we shared the curry chips, which were excellent. A huge portion (for a good price), and I don't know what they did with the curry, but I loved it, and I'm not normally a fan of curry. As my husband was due to arrive into Vegas later that night, I immediately made plans to bring him back in for drinks and dinner.  Flash forward a few hours, and he and I are sitting in the snug, dining on some awesome food (get the salmon...mmmm.) and listening to a decent \"Irish\" band. (They didn't just play trad Irish, but also threw a bit of everything in, from classic rock and beyond). We moved to the bar after dinner, and  my husband strikes up a conversation with the bartender, who is (of course!) from my husband's home town.   This experience pretty much laid the foundation for our weekend in Vegas, as I think we managed to come back to Ri Ra at least 3 more times over the weekend, and each time was a lot of fun - full or empty, music or no music.   I already can't wait for my next trip back to Vegas in October, as I'll definitely be a repeat customer at Ri Ra. Just save me a seat at the bar, and have a menu and a Jameson ready for me.",

Don't know what he called it, what's in it or anything but it was amazing. Couldn't love this place anymore. We will be back anytime we are in town and when we move back. It's on the strip but it's very local friendly.   Also, the Guinness Stew & Shepards Pie are to die for! Food is always really good and staff very attentive.  Great place to book parties & receptions. Keeps the pub atmosphere while still being very classy. And the live music is always great :)",

The decor is gorgeous and it seems like it would be a great place to go on a weekend night for entertainment. Our server was from Ireland and was friendly and helpful. My friend had the soup and sandwich combo and I had the daily roast. Oh my God, that was awesome. The roast beef was great, the vegetables were great, the yorkshire pudding was great. I hate broccoli and never like the smell or having it anywhere near the rest of my food. There was broccoli mixed into the vegetables and everything was so good I didn't even care that my other veggies were \"fraternizing\" with the broccoli. That meal was the highlight of my day. I will be back probably any time I am at Mandalay Bay.",

    "text": "My friends and I were looking or a place to chill and have a few drinks and we came across Ri Ra Irish Pub in Mandalay Place and figured to give it a shot. None of us have been to an Irish pub so I we were excited to find out what they have to offer.  The hostess asked if we preferred to sit close to the live band but she not-so-subtly implied that we may want to sit in a booth further away because it gets pretty loud. We took her advice and sat in a booth in a room where we could still hear the music but still hear each other.  Cha-ching! First thing we noticed was that they have happy hour all day everyday for the entire month of March. A pint of Black and Tan or Half and Half is only $4. The boys took advantage of the happy hour and the girls ordered cocktails which were at a regular Strip bar price of $13.  We ordered the chicken wings which were pretty decent and the fish and chips. We were surprised by how good the fish and chips tasted.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the batter was light and not greasy at all. The chips were well seasoned. The regular size was $13.95 and the large is $18.95. We just got the regular and it was filling for two people.   To end our meal, we asked the waitress for Irish coffee and she asked, \"Do you want real Irish coffee?\" to which we agreed even though we didn't know the difference. Little did we know that real Irish coffee comes with a good amount of whiskey! It was good for the first few sips but got a little too strong for our amateur taste buds. One Irish coffee costs $8.  All in all, our first Irish pub experience was memorable. Service was really good; they checked on us regularly and kept our table clear of extra glasses and plates. I would definitely go again just for the fish and chips and to take advantage of their March happy hour special.",

Like something your mom would throw together by making a burger by hand.  It was not some already shaped and formed patty.  Our friends got the pie and the rueben. They didn't share. But they enjoyed it.  We went to see Flogging Molly after dinner. The Irish pub fit well for pre-concert dinner! The seating chicks at the front did look rather glum though. I think one was swearing under her breath.  Seriously cheer up ladies!! Is it that bad? Good food, good service. Gotta get past the unhappy hostess.",

    "text": "Don't wait until St Patrick's Day to visit this great pub. A great spot to start your night off or to take a break from power shopping at Mandalay Place, Ri Ra embodies everything a great Irish bar should be. The best part is they're not lazy about their bar food. The menu is unassuming and reasonably priced (keep in mind it IS on the strip, so don't expect $2.50 beers and $4.99 chicken fingers) and boy was I glad I tried some unique stuff suggested by some regulars in our group.   Baked goat cheese. Something about it just seems weird to me, so it's not something I seek out on menus. But I advise you to do so. So warm and tasty and it comes with fun little toppings to slap on the toasty bread. Great for sharing over some beers, of which they have plenty of. I love the Shandy, light and refreshing and not too filling. Moving on to Malt Vinegar Mayo sauce with fries. That is a real thing and it is amazing. At first I was like, hmm vinegar and mayo? Sounds dangerous. Well the only danger is you choking because you're hoovering this into your face hole. So good and they give you a good portion when ordered as a side. The sandwiches are massive and look tasty.   Service is great, I've never had a bad experience. Bonus points for scoring a seat where the server is from Ireland...I swear something about the accent makes the food taste better here. The decor is very rich and authentic looking. As a matter of fact some pieces of the bar are actually imported from Ireland, thought that was a fun fact. Take a walk around as each room has a different feel to it.   Local or tourist, definitely put this place on your list to try out.",

Since I live in Vegas and work at the Bay, I was clearly excited when I found out that we were getting an Irish pub of our own. I am yet to go to Ri Ra and have anything less than a great time.   Lets clear a little something up, Mr. Ben G. Yes, the employees who work there, who are from Ireland...wait for it... They're actually from Ireland. Some are on a one time visa and some are on a permanent visa. Those who are short term, actually live very, very near by. Do you really think they could find that many individuals to fake an accent like that? Didn't think so... although if you head in late, late, late at night you'll find our douche bag so cal guys thinking that they have somehow become Irish and adopted an Irish accent... Anyhow, I'm yet to meet a wretch of an employee there... one girl had an extremely hard time hearing us and didn't think to double check our orders, because the music was too loud and she was caught up in having a good time. Either way, the girl was still a joy and that's the only close to meh experience Ive ever had there.   The guys at the door, bar tenders, servers and managers always remember us. The music is always fab (Irish music during dinner time and a live rock band later in the evening). It is very loud. If you want to chat with someone and \"get to know them\" go somewhere quieter.   Ive order their halibut on wasabi potatoes au gratin and Ive also had their gyro wrap ( they call it something different and its on their late menu). If you aren't a fan of lamb and are not familiar with Irish food, watch what you order and don't be afraid to ask what is in it. For instance, shepherds pie in the US is made with ground beef... Irish shepherds pie is made with ground lamb and lets not even get into the blood pudding. Irsih bangers are always great too. If you want to be a stuffy diner, and don't appreciate the hospitality of western Europeans... go back down and have your dinner at Strip Steak (which is always wonderful but for a different breed).",

Loved the decor...consistent with the Irish pub feel. They have a special this month for Guiness...great deal!  The goat cheese appetizer was amazing. I'm not a goat cheese fan but they added cream cheese to minimize the pungent goat taste..and with the condiments, so tasty! I ate most of the dish. Both ordered fish n'chips...regular size. Perfect portion since we got an app first. Fresh cut fries. The fish was perfect and I felt that the tarter sauce wasn't needed. Also ordered dessert..their version of brownie sundae. It was good and not sickly sweet...but wasn't a Wow for me..but I'm a dessert snob.  They give local's discount of 20% which was great but on Fridays it's 40%...we will keep that in mind next time.  I was happy with the value of the food (app, 2 entrees, dessert, 5 drinks) of less than $90 before tip. Service was perfect...thanks Katie! We will definitely be back!",

The atmosphere was nice, very pub-like with dark woods and wall cabinets showing off bottles of whiskey, although I would have preferred a few more cozy booths.  The place was probably 1/3 to 1/2 full.  The fish and chips were pretty good.  Specifically, the fried fish was quite possibly the best I've had in the US, but definitely not as good as served in the UK (it was hot and tasty and probably 2-3 servings for the small/regular size but the batter slid off the fish, was somewhat too greasy, and did not have a very deep/complex flavor).  The chips were rather poorer and were not freshly cooked like the fish, but the fries were still passable/edible (salted just right and a good size, but limp and slightly overcooked).  The Bass pint was good too.  Total was $21 before tip.  My waiter was extremely attentive.  I would definitely go here again for lunch but probably not twice in one trip to Las Vegas.",

Obviously, there was the fact that we were having good liquor with every bite, but all of us (opinion of 8) believed the food was pretty great all on it's own.  Here's the list of the food we had: Smoked Salmon, Sharp Irish Cheddar Cheese Platter, Shepherd's pie, Pork Belly, Tomato bisque, and Dark Chocolate Cake.  I would greatly recommend the Shepherd's pie (which was made with lamb instead of the usual plain ground beef [I'll add a note here that I am biased here, because I LOVE lamb]) and the tomato soup (creamy and tangy at the same time, delicious!).  Everything else was tasty too, but those two items were just so over-the-top awesome that I have to give them extra credit.  It was also nice that they reserved a room for us, so it wasn't quite as loud as the rest of the pub, and we could somewhat still talk to each other.  Music was good too (again, I will add that I might be biased, as they started off with \"Whiskey in the Jar\").  A tad expensive for pub food I'll admit, but reserve some of that gambling money for at least one meal here.",

Amazing fish and chips, the best sweet potato fries, and even their vegetables were tasty! Good to know you can still stay healthy while surrounded by pub fare - I ordered the Hummus wrap and it was pretty good. Since I didn't feel like ordering a $15 cocktail I stuck with the $6.50 pear cider, it was pretty huge and a good deal. They currently have a promotion where if you check in on foursquare you can save 10% off food. For 3 entrees and 2 drinks it was around $50. Overall, the 3 of us left smiling and satisfied.",

Got here and was seated in their spacious back-room and had Junior (John Paul) as our server. Dude was cool took our orders and came back a few minutes later apologizing because they didn't have enough corned beef. He made some replacement suggestions and took care of the switch up as best he could. We ordered the corned beef and cabbage and the Guinness stew both very good and seasoned just right. Others got the fish and chips and curry (yes curry) and it was good! Service was excellent and Junior had a great sense of humor and made our dining experience very fun memorable. I'd definitely recommend this place it's really not what you would expect from a pub located in the Mandalay Shoppes but it has good live music and a great overall casual place to have a meal with friends. Food is pretty good I would give it 4 stars on the food but the experience from Junior made it a 5 overall in my book!",

    "text": "I loved this place! My only wish is that we had something like this up in our neck of the woods. We live in the NW corner of the valley and driving to the strip gets old fast. We lived in Japan for nearly a decade and one of our favorite hang outs was an Irish pub. Yes, an excellent Irish pub in small town Japan. It was great. We've been missing that. This place came close. It is a chain so it didn't quite get to that intimate mom & pop feel but it was close. The atmosphere is perfect. It is dark and cozy. Our server was adorable. He was friendly, efficient and attentive. The accent was a huge bonus. I don't know if it was real but it was convincing enough for me. I told my  husbnd to tip extra just beause I got to hear the Irish accent. :)   The food? Delicious. I'm a salmon fanatic and they have a few salmon selections to choose from. I ended up getting the salmon rlt. It was not an easy choice to make though and I will have to go back to try some other items. The salmon rlt was so good I couldn't stop saying so and I'm sure I annoyed our friend who was with us. My husband got the fish & chips. He can be rather picky about fish & chips. While in Germany visiting family we took him to a British military installation where he had the best fish & chips he's ever had and he has yet to find anything that compares. This came close. The chips were not quite up to his high standards but he says the fish was excellent. It must have been because the portion was huge and he ate all of it. Our friend got the Guinness & beef stew and said it was good. He didn't rave about it but he seemed content. We all agreed it was a nice lunch and we'd go there again.  I cannot wait to go back and pick another item off the menu.",

Each time I've gone, the servers we had were all from Ireland.  I love their accents and friendliness. Thus far, we've had the irish sausages wrapped in phyllo dough as an appetizer with a spicy brown mustard - To Die For!   I've had the Focaccia Chicken Sandwich w/ peppers, rocket....Fabulous!  The Kilcooly which is Boar's head turkey, irish cheddar, irish bacon, and a very tasty schmear - Awesome!  Irish Mac and Cheese was the 3rd entree I've tried - my fave!  You can have it plain w/ the bread crumbs toasted on top, or add shrimp or chicken. I had it w/ chicken. It's quite small, but definitely enough for one person.  My friends last night all ordered either the small size fish and chips and the Guiness Beef Stew. There were no leftovers.  :)     The small size fish and chips is about 10-12oz, while the large portion is about 14-18 oz.  The \"chips\" are hand cut and really good!  I have always loved malt vinegar on my fries growing up, and am happy that others enjoy the flavor as much as I do!",

Clearly the food here is good I think that I just ordered the wrong menu item (even though it was a server recommendation.) Salmon portion was generous but mashed potatoes, asparagus and Beurre Blanc did not measure up in the taste category. Friends had wings, chop chop salad and a burger, & sandwich. Lemon Drop was very good but second order had to be returned due to lack of sugared rim. Hey, it's what makes this drink so darn good. Here is the kicker, and it's a good one! In the front of the house they had a threesome playing Irish songs. They were good but it was piped into the dining area and made conversation nigh impossible. I get the check $192.00 for dinner for five, drink for each and they have tacked on $16.00 for live entertainment. I did not say anything, tipped 20% and left feeling ripped off. I have never had this fee added to a dinner check when the \"house\" is offering live music in another venue. Shame on you for the sneaky move to extract more money from unsuspecting tourists.",

But the food was good, and so was the atmosphere, so we didn't mind. When we went in there our last night I was kinda broke. I read on the menu that Jameson was $6 a shot. I got it because it was so cheap. When we moved to out table and got a server a ordered a few more. When the bill came they charged $10 a shot (plus the live music tax, plus 23% gratuity, plus alcohol tax). It was far more than double what I thought I would be paying. I told the server the menu at the bar said $6 a shot. He said no way. I said I'll go get it and show you. He said he'd go get it. He came back with the menu and said it says $8, but our prices go up all the time so you have to pay $10. Slammed it, and walked off before I could ask to see it. So I did. Then as I was walking out I had to look, because I knew it said $6. Sure enough. I tried to flag our server down, and he literally ran in the back. I asked another server to get him. They came back and said he went home. I asked for a manager, and they said there wasn't one. All the bartender would do was give me another shot after standing there yelling at my cousin and I for 5 mins. Any place that employees people that will straight out lie to customers, bait and switch customers, and yell at customers gets 1 star (even though their chicken sandwich may be the best thing I've ever eaten).",

They have a different late night menu, and this review speaks only for that:  We sat down in the front to avoid the sad Irish band playing in the back, and had to go to the bar to request table service. We were starving so we ordered the curry and chips to start, both of which I believe may have been microwaved, but decent enough for me to eat in my ravenous state. For entrees I ordered the Reuben, which was yummy, but came with sad chips, and my boyfriend ordered the burger - it was PATHETIC! I have not seen a burger this sad since I left elementary school, a lukewarm brown patty sitting between two pieces of dry bread. My poor, hungry, boyfriend didn't eat it, and we left.   Also I ordered a Guinness and Smithwicks, and the waitress brought me one of each. When I acted surprised to have gotten two beers, she told me I should have ordered a \"blacksmith,\" and walked away, mind you I never saw a drink menu. Weird. I drank both. YUM.  This place gets one star for Guinness and Smithwicks on tap, and one star for the reuben. But, I don't recommend going here for a late night meal, you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "I love Irish pubs and have visited my fair share. This one is definitely, one of the best. Probably the worst part of Ri Ra, is it's location. You might even miss it, walking by. Over the years, their biggest competitor (Nine Fine Irishmen, at NYNY) has slowly fallen out of favor with me. In fact, the ONLY thing I think Nine Fine has the upper leg on, anymore, is the decor, and that's only because it's two levels vs. Ri Ra's one.  The facade is in the Mandalay Bay/Luxor mall, which is known as Mandalay Place. It's a rather small entry and doesn't offer a very good view of the interior. Once inside, it's a well apportioned Irish Pub with plenty of traditional decor and very dark tones. I like my pubs dark, this one nailed it. It's a rather long and narrow restaurant with a bar on one side and booths on the other. As with any good pub, you can get food at the bar, and typically better service and conversation.  We happened into this place on a Saturday morning and tried a couple items from the brunch menu. I had the Irish eggs benedict. They were poached eggs on potato cakes, rashers, with sauce and a side of hash brown potatoes. The only thing I can find wrong, was the eggs were overcooked. Poached eggs should be runny and they were past that point. Everything else was perfect. It was a lot of potato, but that's Irish food and I like it. Especially good for nursing a hangover. My wife had the corned beef sandwich with curry chips. Chips, of course, being what Americans call fries. Excellent with the curry sauce. When we saw it on the menu, we knew it would be a winner. They had the proper condiments, including malt vinegar and HP sauce available on the bar.  We both had a couple of drinks, including something called a \"Plain stout\" that was spectacular. The bartender was very friendly and helpful, although a little on the slow side to stop by and check on us. But his demeanor and attitude made up for it. He seemed to be of the Irish background, along with another 'lad' behind the bar.  Definitely will be returning. I will probably be skipping Nine Fine for this place, if things over at Nine Fine don't improve. Really a very good find in Vegas for me.",

I wanderd in and spent the next few hours drinking and eating and singing along.  I wound up here three more times during my stay in Vegas. Love it. Guinness stew was great and the fish and chips also good. Excellent beers on tap.",

Everything was authentic: From the heavy dark wood, to the real Irish accents of the imported (from Ireland) waiters and bartenders (who call you, \"Luv\"), to the live Irish folk (drinking) music, to the way they poured a stout, to the authentic soda bread, to the most amazing fish and chips this side of the Atlantic! It even had the authentic stench of an Irish pub! If you want Irish, you can't go wrong here! I'll never go to Vegas without spending time in this place, it was one of the highlights of our trip and we will be back again and again! Oh yeah, one more thing that may be a little un-authentic... there were no inebriated hooligans trying to pick a fight with my boyfriend.",

But Ri Ra stands out, so much that my friend and I ate here twice during our 3-day stay.  The classic Irish Pub, Ri Ra is outfitted with all the lacquered wood and trimmings you'd expect.  European football on the television, irish-speaking employees (most of whom have work visas) provide authenticity.  But the food is where it's at!   I was blown away by something as simple as a corned beef quesadilla, and I can still taste the classic Reuben with a little Colman's mustard smeared for good measure.  If you want good, hearty Irish food, do yourself a favor and stop by Ri Ra next time you're at the Mandalay Bay.  I'd even consider taking a cab from another casino for that quesadilla!",

However walk-in and you will discover several rooms with Irish decor and you'll begin to see just how large this place really is!  I was split between many items on the menu since they had simple food with little \"twists\" thrown in.  I decided on a meatloaf burger made with veal, topped with mashed potatoes, onion rings and a Guinness ketchup.  Before I get to the burger, we also split some potato cakes, very crispy on the outside with a balsamic dressing, but soft on the inside.  The burger was different but very tasty packed with flavor (most likely to all the toppings going on!) and it left me very satisfied throughout the day.  Two other people at the table had a huge piece of fish and chips and I stole a bite or two of the soft cod.  Overall I would come here again, especially on Friday's where locals get 40% off!  I am looking forward to trying all the other menu items (my own Fish & Chips, Guniess burger and Shepards Pie come to mind!)",

The care taken in preparing the food we ordered was immediately apparent when we received our Scotch Eggs. Fluffy yolk centers piped back inside the classic battered and fried orbed gems reflect the care of the culinary designer. Served on sturdy aluminum trays too, not plastic baskets.   From the soda bread to the service to the entertainment I found no faults. Irish butter even  adorns the breads.   Our service was very efficient too. Runners bring food out immediately, bypassing the server if they are occupied.   It was a welcome retreat from the overcrowded and overpriced places in its vicinity. The place just feels real and transports the customer to a place where people talk funny and make claims like \"Guinness is not just for breakfast any more.\"  A pleasant experience in all aspects.   A well managed joint for sure.",

Better hurry because this special will not last much longer.  The meat was even better dipped in an additional hot Gaelic Sauce that was brought to the table.  Accompanying spears of thin asparagus were good, and a starter of a hot bowl of Curried Carrot Soup with big hunks of potato was very good.  The soda bread & butter was good and authentic Irish fare, but the edges of this dark bread product are rather rough, and I like French and Italian bread so much more.    Diane's large order of Fish & Chips was just that--a very large and delectable fried fish fillet.  I enjoyed one moist bite, she ate half of what was left, and then she took the remaining portion home to savor for lunch the next day.  Of course, I finished all of my food in one sitting!    Service was very good, and I liked hearing all of the Irish accents that resounded throughout the place.  The 20% local discount was the cherry on top for this fine Irish dining experience.  * * * * -1/2 overall on this particular outing!",

To start off, our waitress is awesome. she's got this super cool Irish accent, and she's very attentive, but not so that it makes you uncomfortable. And I'm pretty surprised that they stick to Irish music, too, even for the pop songs. I haven't heard the Corrs for so long, it was quite a nice throwback moment.   I ordered the guinness stew, I've never been to Ireland but it's pretty solid. one thing that stood out was the brussel sprouts & bacon as a side dish...Man, I would eat that as an entree if I could. it's really tasty.

Dim lighting. A few flat screen TV's with baseball games & replay of soccer world cup. Customer service was attentive & quick.   We were surprised to receive complimentary soda bread. We are from the bay area in Cali and at Foley's, they charge for soda bread. We were happy customers. The chicken wings (mild) was delicious. I ordered the fish & chips and he ordered the shepherd's pie. The fish was huge. I've never seen it served like that ever in my whole life. It was a great deal.   Everything was good, however, there was bug in my plate. It could be flea. Yuck. I did not see it when it was presented to me. Due to the dim lighting, it must've landed on my plate afterwards. I had to shoo it away with my napkin. Of course, I stopped eating right after that. We did not finish our meal. We were full from eating the chicken wings and soda bread. Took the food to go.   It was nice they have live band music after 8:45pm. We had a chance to listen to the band. That was lovely.  The prices were just right. Not expensive compared to other places. We will definitely be back when we are in Las Vegas.",

My Guiness Stew was VERY salty and it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was nothing more than warmed up can of Dinty Moore. Conversely, though, my wife's Chicken and Sausage Ragout was VERY good. Others in our group ordered the Irish Breakfast, Shrimp Cocktain, Ceasar Salad, and Herb Grilled Chicken. Each shared that their meal was good, but nothing extraordinary.  Beverages... I polished off two pints of Guiness, as did another in our party. Each pint was served at the perfect temperature with a good, solid head. We also chased it with a shot of Jameson's (18 yo) that was a perfect compliment. Everyone else in the group enjoyed iced tea or soda.  Service... Just a bit slow and inattentive. The wait staff appeared to be thin in the ranks, so this may explain the extended wait time between visits - which led to a lot of empty and waiting for refill beverage glasses and the like. Also falling under the service category is that we were seated in one of the pub sections with the expected high bar table and chairs. This, despite one in our party having mobility issues and the high chair being a great challenge. There were PLENTY of empty tables in the dining room but, for reasons still not clear, they would not seat us anywhere but the pub.  Ambiance - VERY nice, from an Irish pub perspective. I appreciate how the owner literally disassembled multiple small pubs in Irelands and brought each to Las Vegas to build one restaurant with a bunch of different pub rooms from different eras. There was also a live Irish folk band, The Shams, playing throughout out meal. They were very good and offered some great, enjoyable music.",

I had no idea how far back and large this place actually was. They have 2 full bars, great decor and lively atmosphere. The house band that was playing was outstanding.  But we were really here for the food...  It was great to be served by a nice young lady with a Irish accent. I thought is was legit, my sister thought acting. Who knows?! In any case, it was cool.  We started off with the ceasear (nothing special), some complimentary soda bread and some mild wings. We agreed that they were some of the best wings we ever had. Well done and cripsy and not over sauced. They come with blue cheese and we asked for ranch, not sure what we got but it seemed like a mix of the two. Not the \"old people\" blue cheese you are used to, but a light, tangy dipping sauce.  We shared a large \"award winning\" fish and chips and it was delcious! Perfectly cooked and breaded, tartar sauce was great. We couldn't even finish the large portion between the 2 of us.  My only regret is that I didn't have room for dessert!",

The food was on point, and they handled the cake after we had cut it and did our thing. The band was exceptional and even played our first dance to a room full of rowdy pub goers that serenaded us along with the band. It was one in a long list of good decisions. A big thank you to the Ri Ra staff for a superb night.",

Do keep in mind that RiRa does serve breakfast.  By 9 AM, the bar had a decent crowd, but only one bartender, Jack.  I ordered a scone with a side order of bacon.  It took about 15 minutes for my plate to arrive.  Sadly, the scone was hard as a rock and burnt.  I informed the waitress that I preferred a new scone.  She came back 5 minutes later saying it was the only scone they had left and if I wanted another one the cook would have to make more.  Well, isn't this a restaurant?  I could not eat the hard burnt blueberry scone.  Also, my tea was barely warm and not hot.  I was disappointed in this trip.  They were down one person that morning.  Jack was speedily busy behind the bar, and still managed to be attentive and polite.  I may or may not try this place again.",

I was ony in Vegas for 3 days but came twice.   For breakfast I recommend the Irish breakfast...proper bangers (sausages for you Americans ), Irish bacon (the proper stuff ) , eggs, black and white pudding, mushrooms,  tomatoes and toast all for 14 usd. Winner.  Wait you can have real baked beans on the side for an extra 3 usd . Be good to yourself they are worth every penny.  For dinner I would definitely go with the fish n chips. Batter was perfect on a huge piece of fish with lovely handcut chips (fries). They were out of mushy peas or that would have beeb the icing on the cake.   Sit back have a chat with Irish bar staff and for a moment you ain't in Kansas I mean Vegas any more .  Make sure you get the condinents and give them a whirl..yes vinegar on the chips and brown sauce on the breakfast.  Desserts. ...hell no I'm stuffed.",

When we were finally seated, Niamh, our waitress was phenomenal! We had corn fritters for our appetizer; I liked them plain, no sauce, so you could taste all the delightful flavors of corn and the breading.  For dinner, shepherds pie of course! How could you go wrong? And, mmmm it was full of meaty goodness! My husband had fish n chips with a side of bachelor's peas. I tasted a bite of everything and must say that I enjoyed the fries the most! (I'm a fry kinda gal!)  But he just loved the bachelor's peas and wants to try making them at home!",

    "text": "We arrived about 1 hour before our Cirque du Soleil show, starving and in dire need of food.  We would have eaten just about anywhere, but we needed something in close proximity to our theater.  House of Blues - the closest - had a 20 minute wait, so we went up the escalator to the Mandalay Bay shoppes.  Honestly, there was no plan to eat anywhere particular, so the first place we could get into - Ri Ra - was where we stayed.  We didn't have much time to really get into the menu.  It took awhile for the server to come to our table, so I was starting to get anxious.  We were seated in the bar, and it was a very crowded night, so perhaps she just didn't notice us right away.  Once she finally showed up, we noticed she had an Irish accent.  And so did another lady that checked on our table.  Not sure if the entire staff was Irish, but it was kind of cool.  The only thing we had time to order was appetizers since by this time we literally had 45 minutes.  Decided to go for the classic potato cakes with sour cream, balsamic and a side of HP Sauce.  I had no idea what HP Sauce was, apparently it's British, but it tastes just like our A1 Steak Sauce.  Anyway, the potato cakes were crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside.  Very, very tasty appetizer.  The other item we got was the Stout Mussels.  My husband and I looooove mussels, and this particular one was steamed in a Guinness stout broth.  Lended a great flavor to the dish.  You could tell there was beer in it, but it wasn't anything overpowering.  Aside from all that, there was live Irish music playing the entire time.  So the atmosphere is very festive, although noisy, so don't come here for a quiet dinner.  We enjoyed our very short stay - we made it to our show on time! - and would love to go back in the future to sample their main entrees.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this pub for a while and was excite when my friends voted last minute to cancel the Mexican and stop in here for some pre concert eats.  Located in Mandalay Place, which in the past could be hard to find from the main hotel, but there are signs EVERYWHERE. (I used to work in the mall, so I know it used to be difficult to find.)     We were seated right away and immediately felt at home. The decor, though new construction, made it feel like it has been there forever. Our waitress came immediately and brought us our drinks very quickly. A Guiness for myself and a summer shandy for my friend. Our other friends arrived and also got the shandy. The crowd was a normal mix of your typical Vegas Strip spot. Old, young, drunk bachelorette, etc. A huge fan of Reubens, I was excited to see it in a prime spot on the menu. Once we ordered our food, Sarah, our waitress brought out soda bread and butter. The bread was delightful, but the butter was those little cold bricks. It tasted fine but I hate having to warm it in my hand in order to make it spreadable.      I got the Publican Reuben with a side of Garlic Creamed Spinach. Other orders at the table included a Caesar Salad and another side of Creamed Spinach. (Did I mention my friends are girls) The reuben was the perfect size (no snake-like jaw acrobatics needed). The meat was tender and juicy with the perfect mix of salty. The sauerkraut was great, but there could have been a little more of it and the sauce was AH-MAZING! The creamed spinach tasted phenomenal. We joked a little at the texture as it was a little baby-foody, but it wasn't bad enough to make us uncomfortable. I would definitely order this side again, though I would order the large size. NOTE: If you are ordering any of the sides by themselves, go large.     When we were finished Sarah asked to bring the bill and even offered to split it up for us. Normally, anywhere on the Strip, when you make this request, it is answered with a shrug, a sigh and a hesitant, if not, passive aggressive, \"Okay.\" All in all, the experience at Ri Ra was a great one. I will be back for the Fish and Chips. Everyone around us was ordering them and they looked mouth wateringly yummy. Make sure you get there early. After 8:45, when the band starts playing, a Live Entertainment Tax is added to you bill. Also, park in the Mandalay Place Valet as it is very close to the restaurant and is so much quicker than parking the Mandalay Bay Parking Garage.",

Everyone was friendly and Irish in this joint, and the smell of the food was mouth watering.  I had the Lamb/Rosemary burger and by-gum it was one of the tastiest burgers EVER.  Lei enjoyed the fish and chips which were hands down the best I have EVER had.  The 21 year old whisky was the icing on this beautiful cake and I will return there in the very near future.  Expensive and a bit touristy for my normal fare, but outstanding food and drink take up the slack.  Oh and it probably isn't very expensive if you skip the 21 year old booze ;)  5 Stars.",

Second, i'd like to point out that they have a ridiculous selection of whiskey! And of course irish beer. The food is excellent. The rueben sandwich is HIGHLY recomended! And also the fish and chips! Their proportions are descent and the overall quality of the food is superb! The service is great! Very friendly staff and very knowledgeable :) which I love! I have yet to try the chocolate chocolate martini (i hear its to die for) but will mosdef be on my list the next time around! I do believe they have local and irish bands play on weekends during the evening so thats definately a plus! And most importantly the atmosphere is awesome! You honestly get a mixed crowd of locals and tourist!  FYI: they do not have the full menu after 10 or 11pm only certain things on the menu but still a great selection is still available for your late night appetite :) the restraunt is located inside mandalay place at the mandalay bay hotel and casino across from the flip flop shop.  enjoy and happy eating!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE!!  I wanted to like this place - was excited that there was a new Irish Bar, and convenient to our hotel room (at THEhotel).  Headed over there on our first day because there was an ad in our room for happy hour - buy a pint of Guiness, get a free shot of whiskey!    Unfortunately, when we asked for the happy hour special, the waitress wasn't aware of it.  We wound up talking to the manager, who said we had to have a coupon (apparently coupons were given to guests of other hotels, like the Luxor), and then said we must have been mistaken, and finally basically called us liars.  We asked if she would honor it if we went and got the ad, she agreed, so we made the trek back to the room, got the ad, and returned.  She did honor it, but we received no apology, no discount for our trouble, nothing.  We had planned on sticking around and having a few other beers, and some grub, but decided to just drink our Guiness and whiskey and leave.  The whiskey, Feckin, was, incidentally very good.  And, although it is in the \"mall\" between MB and Luxor, it had a decent atmosphere inside.  I just can't forgive the rude service, and we won't be back.  Maybe you will have better luck - my advice is be prepared to prove you are right about any advertised specials.",

I left feeling full, content, replete, and well-rested. If that isn't a successful meal, I don't know what is.  I've been to a fair few \"Irish pubs\" before. I put that in quotes because usually, the most Irish thing about them is maybe their name, and the fact that they have Guinness and Harp on draft.   Not so, here! From the genuine warmth and hospitality the servers show, to the deliciousness of the pub grub, to the really decent drinks -- I was really, really pleased.   Foodwise, I had the Dubliner Burger and a side of chips with Irish curry sauce. That lamb burger...oh man, I hadn't expected to find something that good as my first meal. I hadn't. Yeah, I was crazy hungry, but I don't think it was just the hunger talking. That was a seriously tasty burger.   As for the curry sauce...I'm a big curry fan in general. I love all different types of curry, including those milder ones that hail from the UK. There's a place for them all, I say. Especially on chips, and in the mayo on my Dubliner Burger.   The live music was excellent, too. I would have stayed longer if I didn't have plans.",

Sat down with a friend we saw who was with a party and we specifically told the server we were a separate check.  Our big mistake because they added a 20 percent gratuity that was mandatory.  I don't mind tipping 30 percent when the server was great but this girl was a joke. Didn't know what simple cocktail drinks were and also was rude. I feel we shouldn't have to tip someone just because even if there terrible. Manager was just as ignorant as the server and they didn't understand the fact that we even didn't know the freaking party. Its about the principle and tips are a privilege not a guarantee.

And to my surprise, it opened days before I was expecting, so my friend and I rushed over.   The atmosphere is definitely great. Live music was going and you could tell everyone was having a good time. There is ample seating, though the seats closer to the stage aren't ideal for trying to have a conversation with the people you're with.   As for the service, it was a bit slow at first. But after the waitress made initial contact, things went smoothly from there.   They're having a couple specials for the month of March, $4 for a Half & Half or Black & Tan.   They also weren't serving any food yet, besides the chicken wings and chicken tenders. I'm excited to go back to try their fish & chips or their McDonnell's Curry Sauce.   I'm looking forward to heading there on St. Patrick's day and probably a few other days before that. =p",

    "text": "So, funny story on this place.  My husband ate here on a guy's trip and kept raving about the breakfast ... He couldn't remember the name of it though. Fast forward to this trip, he was excited for me to experience an \"amazing\" breakfast. Yeah, I was pretty sure he was just really hungover and THOUGHT it was great. Anyway, when we walked up to the front of it I started laughing to a point where he got annoyed - Ri Ra - the bar that I frequented in COLLEGE (in Northern Virginia) that smelled like a frat house, sticky floor included... yepp, this is the place he was begging to take me to. I got a kick out of the situation HOWEVER the food, I was surprised - it was good! There was an Irish family next to us (like, from Ireland - not just family heritage) - they were going on and on to the waitress how impressed they were of our take on their food; they said it was pretty spot on. Okay, I was convinced.  The portions are huge but between the 4 of us - the guys ate to feed an army; us ladies got a typical breakfast and were satisfied.Great coffee as well, it tasted fresh (we also got there right when they opened).  I wouldn't be disappointed to return here but now it's my turn to take my husband to my favorite place in the Wynn. Ironically I can't remember the name of it either (been there 3 or 4 times though, it is consistently good).",

The music is a tad too loud for me when I am not intoxicated and actually want to have a conversation, but that doesn't mean it's not a cool thing. I don't think they have music every night, but they have it quite often.    I can't comment on the food, but if you're in the market for a bible's worth of whiskey to share with friends in a quality atmosphere, this is a nice alternative to a super-swanky Vegas lounge. Heck, the bartenders even have Irish accents, which makes me want to drink more.   The bar is beautiful, but my absolute favorite part is the little living room-styled back room. If you walk in, go to the end of the bar, and make a hard left you will enter what appears to be a rec room straight from a 70s Irish home. There are couches, wood paneling, bad wallpaper... every detail is perfect and cozy. It's an amazing room to host 20-30 people for a cocktail event, and a nice spot to pull up a stool, sip whiskey and listen to an Irish lilt.",

I found the service to be great. However, I was sitting at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and welcoming and came with an Irish accent to go with the Irish bar.  He didn't give the feeling that he wished I would order drinks instead of food and also made recomendations.  One of his recomendations was the fish and chips.  I figure that I can get that at home, but if a nice guy recomends it then it must be something they are proud of.  I ordered it.   The fish was very good.  One very large piece of battered fish sitting on chips (french fries).  With some malt vinegar the fish was excellent. The chips were not.  They were soaked in grease from the fish and soggy.  Too bad really. I thought they were a victim of bad platting.   I would definately go back.  Next time no fries and hoepfully I can raise the score.",

The potato cakes themselves are light and fluffy, and the accompanying sauces are so flavorful.  The Guinness BBQ burger is really good. It has a great smoky flavor and the sauce is great. The chicken curry is really good. It isn't too spicy, but it has a nice flavor.  The staff is really friendly, and the restaurant is really nice and relaxed. I just think that the prices, even for Vegas, are a little high. For this reason alone I might skip Ri Ra in the future and spend the same amount of money at a place that I feel has better food for the same price.

They have an amazing foynes irish coffee that you should try if you get to visit - if you haven't tried this before, it's definitely the place to do it. I have never had it and I am not a big fan of coffee based alcoholic drinks, but this really tasted delicious.   We got their famous fish and chips, and although it wasn't bad, I didn't think it was the best one I had. At least for me, it was a little too oily and the batter didn't have enough flavor. The chips were great and I thought the dipping sauces went well.  We also had the shepard's pie, but it was so so. A bit too cold and lacking in flavor, wish it had more seasoning and was served scorching hot.   The service was outstanding! Our waitress did a great job and was very attentive.",

Warning do no order the potato cakes, they took as long as the entree plus not worth it as far as taste is concerned.  The highlight of the night was the server. Her name is Demi like Demi Lovato-Lol! She was refreshing, engaging, pleasant and very informative. She advised us well. We got the Fish and Chips and Gunness stew. Both equally good and both highly recommended-Yum!  For dessert we got the trinity and ala mode apple pie-individually baked- heaven! The place is casual and has a live band that plays between 8 pm and midnight. The place is a bit pricey but the whole experience is well worth it!  I highly recommend Demi (sit in her section) and the food here! Great dining experience. We'll be back!",

Not necessarily the pub environment I like, but with a popular spot that's the risk you take.  I've been dying for good fish and chips since I moved to the area and I've heard good things about this place so the choice was easy. The portion was quite large and a (un?)healthy amount of fries were provided, but the price seemed pretty high for the overall experience. The actual fish was cooked perfectly but the batter surrounding it, while crispy, was bland. With so many options in the area for dining, I'm not sure if I would return to give them another chance.",

    "text": "Best. Irish. Pub. Hands down.  Visit 1 - We came into Vegas post lunchtime Sunday, and we were looking for some lunch. Decided to come back to old faithful RiRa for sausage rolls to start and fish & chips to share. We got the sausage rolls & even though they tasted like they could've been a hair under fresh, they still were dee-lish and melted in our mouths with that amazing mustard sauce. Then the fish & chips came, and where the fish was light & flaky with a beautifully crispy batter, the fries were soggy & stale, and the vinegar tasted almost watered down. We asked for proper chips, and they obliged, but with a portion 1/3 the size. We balked and management was kind enough to return with a massive portion of fresh, crispy, delicious fries AND knock $5 off the bill for our trouble. The waiter was kind & semi helpful, if not for him being totally forgetful about a few things, he would have been aces.   Visit 2 - Unwittingly, we ended up back the same day for a late, late dinner after 9:30pm fireworks on the strip and s nap in the room. Amy was our server, fresh from Ireland, and was fantastic, sweet, and chatty but authentically as helpful as could be. We ordered Guinness Beef Stew, to DIE for, and a Guinness burger, and topped it with a pint of Guinness Stout. Well the Stout was the best tasting, best pour I've ever had on a beer, by far. The stew was best I've had next to my wife's amazing recipe, and the burger was perfectly delicious, if not totally outperformed by the stew. The only problem I had with the stew was that it ran out, so I quickly ordered another Stout to make up for it. Amy was great. Music by the Black Dubliners was on point, and food & brew were home runs. We'll be back for more before we leave!!",

Nice crispy toast (half slice) with creamy avocado spread, pickled red onions and drizzled with balsamic with good mix of salad greens make this a Star you do not expect at a pub. I paired with the house Caesar Salad which could have used more parm and dressing but was large portion of full romaine leaves. Wife went for smothered chicken and the mushrooms and spinach mix over the top was great. Good service and great Irish live music at night to get you going. They were a little steep for Jameson's doubles ($22ea), but we figured the ambiance was included.",

I was really excited to try out Rira, as my fiance and his cousin had tried it the day before and loved it. I knew that they opened at a certain time which I believe on weekends is about 9 AM. That particular morning we showed up anxiously awaiting a delicious breakfast and also starving, and the manager said that since there was a soccer game that was going into overtime, we had to wait until the soccer game is finished to come in for breakfast. First of all, when an establishment advertises that they open at a certain time, they should allow patrons to show up at that time. I was furious, it wasn't the hostesses fault, she just shrugged her shoulders and gave us a look as if \" I don't make the rules here.\" I would never recommend this place. I hate False advertisement, and I hate rude and uninviting management. Although, I never got to experience the delicious breakfast aforementioned I still would have a bad taste in my mouth for the service.",

Being in Ireland last year, it really felt like we took a step back there! Will definitely come back to try the food, beer and hopefully catch a live band.  If you are looking for a fun afternoon tea experience, this is it! The tea sandwiches were large size and yummy! We had cucumber and egg salad. The tray also included scones and dessert. The tea was delicious! They also serve  Ireland's Barry's Tea.  Our servers were so nice and helpful! They checked on us just enough times, making sure they didn't interrupt too much as they knew we were girlfriends catching up! They poured our tea, went over our treats and were just so friendly!  Price was reasonable at $24, where Others on strip are 35 or 45.  Overall just a great experience! Can't wait to to go back, thinking of having a birthday there in their separate room!",

We sat in the area outside the bar. We don't drink and it was a tad too loud for me in the bar area, but the bar patrons were well chuffed with the atmosphere. The food was amazing! Except for that seedy bread we were given to snack on before the meal. That loaf was truly some authentic Game of Thrones original recipe. I opted for the fish and chips. The fish was soooooooooo freaking good but the POTATOES... beyond exceptional. They must have shipped those spuds from Ireland. The tarter sauce was not my favorite but the malt vinegar kept me happy. My husband had the Turkey Avocado Burger and said it was the best turkey burger he has ever had in his entire life. I was too satisfied with my fish to do a taste off.",

The inside space is huge with lots of sectioned rooms. We tried the potato pancakes, the potato leek soup, the fish and chips, and the corned beef and cabbage. I thought all the food was tasty but the portions were way too much! We easily could've gotten half the amount and been stuffed. We also ended up ordering too many things that had potato as a base so we got full very fast. The fish and chips and the corned beef were my favorites. If you're looking for a quick casual bite this is a great choice.",

    "text": "Wanted to continue the new restaurant exploration and this time I've decided to try some Irish food!  I ordered the Guinness stew, fish and chips, and the pork belly with polenta. The stew was decent and it reminded me of pot roast. The portion looks small but is is filling and hearty. For the fish and chips, the fish was lightly breaded so you can actually taste the fish, albeit it doesn't have too much flavor on its own. The tartar sauce was pretty good and helps with adding in much needed moisture and flavor to the dish. Also forgot to mention that the fish was huge! I got full after eating less than half of it lol. The fries were a lost cause. Pretty much soaked and soggy from all that oilZ I had a few pieces and had to call it quits because it was pretty disgusting to see all the oil sweeping out lol. Wish the fries were nice and crispy especially when paying $20+ for that dish. The pork belly was delicious but the polenta it came with was pretty dry and flavorless. I had to scrape the little amount of hoisen sauce they provided to make it edible. The free bread and butter was decent, but the bread itself was really dry and grainy tasting.   Overall the dinner experience was decent. I don't know if I would come back here just because the food wasn't that special to me. I'll be exploring more Irish food at a different establishment to see how they do it.",

I can't even explain the soft yet crunchy delectable little morsels of potato heaven.. if this is what Ireland food is like I wanna go visit there ASAP! Any-who our waiter COREY was great on helping us select our entrees which me and my husband shared. We got the Ruben sandwich with pub fries so good and we shared the potato leek soup as well another great appetizer.. overall our experience was great all do to recommendations from our waiter Corey!",

We ordered the sausage rolls app, at $12, they give you 2 tiny sausage covered in filo dough drizzled with sauce.  I saw the plate and knew the rest of the meal was going to be disappointing.  $13 for a burger slider (effectively), and $17 for flavorless shepherd's pie.    Our waitress (Jane) was great, and I want to increase my overall rating for her, but that's what brings it from 0 to 1 star at all.  I don't know why anyone would go here, you're better off eating fast food at McDonald's...  Heed the warning, go elsewhere, less you be disappointed with the meager portion sizes too.",

I'm in love, fried jalapenos and not these pre-breaded rings, hear we're like roasted long strips of jalapeno then tossed in breading and fried. Peanut butter on one side of the bun and jam on the other. This was cooked perfectly. When I have the chance I order y Burgers MR.   service was pretty spot on even for being a busy Sat night.

The food was really good very tasty.  Something odd happened, the fire alarms were going off while we were in there. The staff looked very confused and they all ran out without telling us if we should be evacuating as well. It turned out to be a False alarm anyway.

Also they have interesting selections of beers and non-alcoholic drinks including kid's beer, just ask for it.   Service was friendly but they were swamped that night so it took a while before our food came out. I suggest that if you plan to eat there, go there early, ideally before 6pm. It got so packed as the night proceeded, and the restaurant wasn't small either! (It looked small from the outside but it wasn't when you walked in there.)

    "text": "Boy am I glad that I was dragged into this place! The food they make here is just purely phenomenal. I came with a party of 10 - we were instantly seated without a reservation. The waiter was extremely nice and friendly. Honestly, you can probably close your eyes and point at any entree on the menu - it will turn out delicious.  My personal favorite is the Cider Glazed Pork Chop ($24). It's cooked perfectly and leaves you hungry for more with each bite. I ordered it medium rare - it was extremely tender and juicy. The oil from the fat layer around the protein just gushes when you cut through - make sure you soak it up with the meat cause it makes it that much better.  If you're a fan of fish and chips; make sure you try the one here ($20). The proportion of this is just gigantic! I've never seen such a large portion for the price of $20. Not only is the price well worth it, but the fish is just cooked to perfection as well - if cut through with your fork or knife, you can see the moisture retained in the fish.  The Ribeye Ragout ($23) is also very good. The ribeye is very tender and the flavor of this dish just... lingers.. In a good way. It really is an explosion of flavor - from the ribeye, to the mushroom, to the other spices they use.  The Chop Chop Salad ($12) is pretty good. A refreshing couple of bites after eating so much meat. The ingredients they use is definitely fresh!  Drinks here are at an expected price: A beer for $6.50. Long island and AMF for $9.50 each.  Overall, my first experience here was great! The only down part is that you cannot use your Mlife Express comps here.",

Of all things to look forward to when in Vegas, my belly calls me back here time and time again. Never a bad meal, experience or eve spent. Tucked away in the hallways between casinos near the Mandalay Bay, it's definitely one to add to your list of places to try. Just love this place (in case you haven't figured it out).  My fave meal (and we've tried nearly everything on the menu) are the Bangers & Mash made on request - not on the menu but ask, proceeded by the Scottish Eggs - best ever, and a thirst quenching Moscow Mule - or two or three to compliment the experience. Or ale, the ale is good too. Portions are filling and shareable, comes hot and fresh. Can't say enough great things. Just go. You'll thank me later.  Love the staff's accents and good vibes, plus the service is top notch, so it's no surprise it's popular. Go early for less waiting and better seats. Decor is dark and pub like with TVs around for sports watchers and live music duo in the eves at the rear/back, or loud music other hours. Seating wise, it appears small but actually goes back pretty deep. We like sitting near the center for fun people watching. Enjoy!",

We'd wandered past Ri Ra  a number of times on this vacation and our last excursion to Vegas and it had caught our attention before but we'd never been.  There were several mouth-watering-sounding items on the menu, so we made the spontaneous decision to scrap our other plans and finally eat here. Slainte!  We got taken all the way back to the way back.  And this restaurant goes WAY BACK.  I'm sure the place seats a lot of people, it's much, much bigger than it looks from the outside.    They brought us water right away and were back before too long to take our orders.  I ordered the Rueben and my husband had the Shepherd's Pie.  The Reuben was among the best I'd ever had.  I actually even picked some of the meat off of the sandwich because it was more than I wanted inside the sandwich!  Husband had the Shepherd's Pie, and adventurous move for him because he wasn't sure he'd like all the vegetables in it (he's not the hugest fan of peas).  It worked out and he loved it!  We walked away feeling stuffed and satisfied, and very happy about our decision to do it.",

That being said, given that our stay was not going to incorporate ethnic eateries (I can get Mexican and Asian food back home) we made reservations at a bunch of Americana spots or in this case, at an Irish spot located in the shops connected to Mandalay Bay.  While our journey here was albeit longer than the typical search for a breakfast joint, access is bia the mall, even if the mall is not open yet so bear that in mind.  Once inside, you are swept away to an envisioned Irish Pub.  If this is what a classic pub looks like, then I'm all game.  Their breakfast menu here is quite extensive and for those looking for direction, I would stick with something classic.  I ordered the Irish Breakfast, which came with the following items: The proper fry up of 2 eggs any style, Irish bangers & rashers, grilled black & white pudding, grilled tomato, sauteed mushrooms & toast.  Reason being, I wanted to try the grilled black and white pudding.  Please note that the platters here are huge, so there is no way you would be able to finish the entire portions.  The butter was the best part.........rich and creamy, like Darigold.    We gobbled up everything prior to heading back out to the strip.  5 stars for ambience, service, food, and just a great reason to get out of the Vegas heat.",

It's a quaint place with dark wood, great food, comfortable seats, servers who are Natives of Ireland, and bartenders who know how to pour a proper Guinness.   We were greeted by Maggie, an Irish girl through and through. She gave us some recommendations, brought our drinks and food in timely manners and chatted with us a bit about her homeland. I don't want to sound silly but her accent made our experience here more memorable.   The menu is huge and filled with good eats and not just boiled potatoes. We ordered a few \"small plates\" including the sausage rolls and potato cakes.  The rolls were a mild sausage surrounded with puff pastry and a sweet mustard sauce. Flaky dough and meat, how can you go wrong? The potato cakes were crunchy on the outside and filled with sharp cheddar and herbs. Served with a side of sour cream, they were devoured quickly.   Besides the bites we ordered the Guinness Stew and it was incredible! The perfect hearty warm comfort food you'd want on a rainy day like today. Tender pieces of beef, potato, veggies a dark Guinness gravy with creamy mashed potatoes on top. The flavors were rich and warm and I'm glad we listened to our servers recommendation and orders it. It's also served with a side of Irish Soda Bread and Kerrygold Irish butter! I could have taken a loaf home. The bread was so delicious and the butter was creamy and salty and better quality then what restaurants normally serve.   I'd love to go back for the live music they have later in the evening and another pint! Slainte!",

The fish comes over a bed of freshly cut fries.  I found both the fish and fries it to be heavily dripping with grease.  It would be nice if the fish was paired with something fresh like a side salad or other side.  The chips just serve as a sponge for the fish.  You have to park at Mandalay Bay to get to the restaurant. This will incur you a parking fee if visiting just for the meal.  The cost for parking is approximately seven dollars depending on how long you stay. By the time you order fish, a couple sodas and pay for parking I feel like you're not getting good value.",

We ordered the Mac and cheese, chicken appetizer, kale salad, and some other salad. Would recommend everything.   As someone in our group was gluten free, the staff was great at adapting menu items (in addition to their multiple gluten free options already offered).  Next time I'm in Vegas and need a quick bite for lunch, I'll come here.",

After a couple of very expensive, \"good but not great\" meals on the Strip with mediocre service, and a few moderately priced, \"just OK\" meals with bad service - this was, by far, the best meal we had in Las Vegas.  Service was excellent and the food was even better.  In our group of six - we had some of everything - Corned Beef & Cabbage, Fish & Chips, Irish Stew...and (what I thought was the best) Shepard's Pie.  I got a taste of everything and I would go back again with no hesitation.  It was such a great atmosphere - we sang the whole time we were eating.  Highly recommended for excellent food, good prices, great service, and a really fun time! I almost forgot the goat cheese appetizer - GET IT!  I consider myself quite the footy and I am still in shock that the best meal I had was a place where I had no reservations -  and no \"Food TV Chef's\" name was attached it it!  I can't think of one thing they could improve.",

    "text": "Went looking for this Irish pub when I had a spare moment on a Vegas business trip. Did not see any directional signage for it on the casino main floor, so had to ask a waitress to point the way.  The pub is located upstairs in The shops area of The Mandalay.   From outside, it looks  small, but that is deceiving, as it actually has a lot of depth when you enter. I recall seeing three or four different bar seating areas as you make your way to the back of the pub.  I chose to seat in the main bar/restaurant area where many families were dining. The pleasant lunchtime atmosphere was enhanced by friendliness of staff who engaged in conversation with patrons seated at the bar.  There was a soccer game and two baseball games being showed on TV in this main lounge area, The bartender frequently called out the latest score to patrons in the front pub area, where no TV's were present. I asked for a Guinness and watched the bartender pour the perfect pint, tilting the glass and filling it three quarter ways, then letting the glass sit for a few minutes, before topping off and drawing a shamrock on the creamy white head. The drink tasted as good as it looked. There has been a massive improvement in the quality of Guinness served in the United States in recent years and kudo's to Diageo and others who have installed great systems and trained bar staff on how to pour the perfect pint. The menu was extensive and included the customary Irish items; fish and chips, shepherds pie, Farmhouse Breakfast with rashers and sausage, and the standard Irish American dish, corned beef and cabbage. I gave thought to the breakfast, but opted for the Bacon Hambuger and added a fried egg on top as one of the extras.   Well, Eat your heart out, Gordon Ramsey, because this burger was as good as the one I had at Ramsey's Burger in Planet Hollywood last month. Large juicy meat patty, fresh bun, crispy bacon and that runny egg yolk. Oh my! Think I had three Guiinness at about $7.75 each.  Total bill with tip was about $45.  Sounds expensive, but the quality was worth it. Vegas is well served with decent authentic Irish pubs like McMullen's on Tropicana being one of my favorites.  Definitely prefer the Ri Ra over the Nine Fine Irishmen in NYNY every time and will stop in again when I am back in town.",

We started with a few appetizers, pub wings, mac and cheese (entree but ordered for the table), tenders and potato cakes. Out of everything so far the mac and cheese was the best.   Four of the nine ordered the porterhouse steak medium rare. When they all came out they were medium well to well done, completely dry, and no flavor at all. The few people that ordered fish and chips said it was good but I wasn't able to try.   The desserts were pretty bad as well. The brownie sundae was burnt when it was microwaved and hard. The guiness cake was decent.   If we didn't have show plans for the night we would have went to lawrys instead, but now we know to never come back.",

I came back when it opened and he fulfilled his promise. First round and by far the best pour I have had in America. Now for Guinness lovers that is a very important thing. I met some of the staff and they are awesome.  Since then I drop by whenever I am in town.  Food is excellent and I've tried most things on the menu.

This establishment had the additional benefit of having a live and entertaining musician who improved on the mood of the night. Upon arrival we had to wait for a table to be made as there was 6 of us and we didn't have a reservation. As soon as we were seated our orders were taken and bread was brought, which was delicious and not the average white bread that is served and most restaurants. We wanted to order cake or ice cream, but were told it was unavailable. Instead we ordered french fries and chips and curry. The french fries are your standard salted skinny fries, nothing above average. The chips and curry are thick fries with curried lamb meat, a curry gravy, and goat cheese, a take on the traditional poutine. The warm creaminess of the goat cheese and the curried lamb taste fantastic together, my only complaint is that the fries don't stand up to the curry gravy and lost their crunchiness and ability to hold the toppings by the time they got to our table.     3.5 stars.     I would come back again to try something else off the menu.",

    "text": "A friend was in town from LA & staying at The Luxor and suggested we meet at Mandalay Place Mall, which is located upstairs in between the Luxor & Mandalay Bay Hotels. The dining options, as per my friend, were Burgers or a an Irish Pub - Ri Ra.  I admit that at the time, BOTH these options sounded very \"touristy\" being located between two MGM owned Hotels. I immediatly went here to Yelp to get some idea of what was \"what\" and was amazed to see there was not one bad thing that was said about the place. This had me even more interested and I even learned that the Pub was an Authentic Irish Pub that had been disassembled & shipped to Las Vegas. As you can see, The Yelp site has 122 photos of the Pub including entrees, decor and the likes and this was very helpful in making the choice between Irish Pub & Burgers.  To be honest, Burgers had the back seat from the start and is why I went to Ri Ra's Yelp page first. I can make Burgers at home. So basically with my mind already made up, I went to the Official web page and it was even more helpful and included a full menu. It was then that I had to fight between the choices of ordering the Shepards Pie, a Rueben Sandwich or The Fish-n-Chips....descions, descions.  And so it was agreed upon that we'd meet at 9pm for dinner on a Tuesday. Upon arriving it was a little tricky finding the entrance but I managed to do so by walking towards the huge lit \"Mandalay Place Valet\" sign and I quickly found the entrance & walked up the stairs vice taking the escalator (Excersice = Do it!!). Ri Ra is just around the corner to the right of the escalators as if you were going to Mandalay Bay. There was a hostess already assisting another party, so thinking that my friend might already be seated I walked in to have a look.   When you walk in past the hostess you enter a small room wt a bar that basically extends the lenght of the Pub and this room opens up into 3 bigger rooms that are dimmly lit and seat diners at tables and booths. In the second Room there was a 2 person acoustic band playing and I made my way past them to the very back and did not see my friend and called her and told her were I was. As I waited at the empty deserted back bar sipping a drink I had brought in with me and watching some soccer match on the flat screen TV, I was eventually approached by a member of the Staff that asked me if I needed anything to which I responded that I was just waiting on someone.   For a Tuesday night the place was half full and lively. I can imagine on the weekends there might be a wait to get a table. As my friend arrived, this was not the case and while at the bar as we discussed where we were going to sit, we were approached by a waiter who told us we could pick wherever we wanted & we quickly took a booth table by the wall that was right in front of us.  Everything, as advertised was GREAT. I ended up deciding on the Fish-n-Chips opting out on the chips & substituting steamed rice which I was very surprised they even had. In hindsight, that was a mistake - not because of any problem with the rice, but the Sweet potato tots would have been a much better option as I found out sampling from my friends friend dish. The piece of fish was very big and very filling. If you like fish, this is an awesome choice and comes perfectly lightly breaded. You cant go wrong ordering this!!  My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken tenders and they were very good as well and I ended up sampling them as she couldnt finish eating them all. They were perfectly spiced and very plump = not overwhelmingly hot and not over breaded and I wouldnt be surprised if they had been hand cut and battered on site. My friends friend ordered a sandwhich of some kind and it look very good as well and as previously mentioned, she couldnt finish eating her Sweet Potato tots and that was very lucky for me. I almost ordered a side myself but between drinks & turning my piece of fish into finger food, was having a time of it on my own.  Overall, between the Atmosphere, the kindness & greatfullness of the staff & the good food I can see why no one had anything bad to say about Ri Ra. I will definatly be back with some company for a one man attack on the Large Fish-n-Chips with the Sweet potato tots next time. I dont usually hand out 5's BUT Ri Ra's is a 5 for sure if not more!!",

She loved the mushy peas more like a thick soup than the UK deep fried slush.  I had a filling and hearty Reuben with sauerkraut and rye.  Yummy.  Our waitress kept on top of it and some good drinks to boot.  Worth a visit if staying nearby.   Supposed to be a fun venue for music in the evening",

    "text": "This place has awesome food and a great atmosphere!  So many choices on the menu, and each and every one I had was delicious.  I'm an out-of-towner or I'd still be sampling some more :-)  The fish & chips was flaky and tasty, the Dubliner (lamb) was medium rare just like I ordered, juicy and delightful with carmelized onions, rosemary and real Irish cheese, and the champ (Irish mashed potatoes with green onions) was a great side dish to go with it. Can't wait to go back and try the chicken curry, shepherd's pie, smoked salmon appetizer (potato cakes are yummy!) and the beef and Guiness stew. It's the kind of place you wish you had 4 stomachs!!!   The staff was charming and engaging, and it was fun comparing how the Ireland I visited 20 years ago has changed . . . and thankfully some of the ways it hasn't :-)  The pub is divided into unique sections, and you really ought to see them all ~ what a feast for the eyes, all that beautiful wood, the exquisite carved bars, memorobelia True to the time on the walls, and knowing that it all was rescued/reclaimed from Ireland really means a lot to me. For those who want a tad more quiet (but who wants quiet when the band's getting your feet moving), there's a couple of lovely side rooms, one in rich theater theme, the other like a cozy family room in the 70s.  Even if you're not Irish, you've gotta check it out ~ it's a not to be missed experience for sure!",

The lamb burger is incredible (if they put enough toppings on it) topped with goat cheese, curry and caramelized onions.  And the sweet potato tots are perfectly seasoned.  The first time I went I picked up the order to-go so I didn't have any issues.  I was so impressed by the food I recommended it to my colleagues and we went back later on in the week.  We waited almost twenty minutes to order and then another forty five minutes for our appetizer.  The manager came over and said sorry it took so long but we were still charged for it.  Then our food came out two minutes later.  Another forty minutes later when our check came it was completely wrong.  Twenty minutes later we got everything sorted out by the manager.  All he offered was an apology.  Needless to say no one was happy about being there for two hours for a burger.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were promptly seated at a table in the back room.   Drinks: pretty good selection, but then again this is Vegas. It'd be a crime for a full service restaurant inside a major hotel to not have a good drinks list.  Food:  - We had the Sweet Potato Tater Tots to start. This is so good, I want some again just thinking about it. And I had it over two months ago! - I felt like eating something 'light but hearty'. Yeah, I can have weird ideas sometimes. So I had the Seafood Stew, and it hit the spot. Fresh chunks of seafood and vegetables in tasty broth. Mmmm.  - The BF had the Irish Stew (it's lamb) and I'm told it's good. That's all I can say since it disappeared before I remembered to ask for a bite to try.  Service was excellent. Our waiter was very personable, I'm even sorry I forgot his name (It's not him; it's me. I'm terrible with names). We told him of the BF's 'no dairy' requirement, and he made sure that he knew 100% whether our dishes safe. He even remembered that he doesn't need butter with his bread, and that there's nothing in the dessert menu we'd really be interested in (well, other than drinks). You'd be surprised how often servers continue to put butter in front of him or offer creamy desserts even after being told of his allergy. It's not much, but it's attention to details like this that make us want to tip our server more. It makes us think that the server remembers as as individuals, not table numbers. Which is why I feel bad about forgetting his name. :P  Price is very reasonable, especially when you consider its location. It's the kind of prices I'd expect to pay if I were outside of  the Strip (note, SoCal ain't cheap, but cheaper than the Strip).",

Checking out the decor it was just as I would expect a pub to look; dark brown wood, a long bar that stretches the length of the restaurant, and a stage for live music.  There are a ton of televisions to watch sports and pass the time.  A very comfortable place!  Hubby and I both ordered the Irish Stew for lunch and it was delicious! Perfect blend of meat and vegetables with a really tasty sauce.  Our server (we moved  to a table) was really funny and got our food right away.

The lamb lacked seasoning but the tasty condiments on the bun made it up. My husband got the same burger with curry fries which was very different but very delicious. Tasty curry gravy over fries.  The complimentary bread and Irish butter was sooo delicious. I didn't get a chance to finish it since I was saving room in my tummy for the lamb burger and now I am regretting for not eating up the last crumb. Server was very nice and helpful.

    "text": "This place is located between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor.  I have a fond memory from a previous visit so this is a bit in comparison to that previous experience.  This time we were seated further back which had some plus and minus'.  The seating in the back area is quieter since there was no live music playing in this area but this also seems to be where the group seating normally is. The table we sat at was wobbly and attempts to correct it had previously failed as evidenced by the wadded napkins and other things at the base.  I preferred sitting closer to the entrance and will request that for future visits.  The mid section is where the music is playing and if you're going to eat I'd probably skip, its a better spot for drinks and the music.    The food is what really stands out for me at this pub.  They have a really good, thick, Guinness stew that I really enjoyed and comes with some mashed potato on top.  They serve it with some Irish bread and butter which altogether hits the spot.  The food seems to have stayed consistent over the years which I really like that, that is dependable.  I didn't see it on the menu and frankly I didn't ask but in the past they had a whiskey sampler I didn't see this time that I would have liked to have tried again.  The single most off putting part of my experience is that the place seems like it needs a fresh coat of paint.  The back area felt run down.  I liked that it was quieter and made for a better overall dinning experience but the tables need some help and the chairs replaced.  I think they should rethink the flow so they can have their dinning areas and \"party\" areas separated a little more.  The chairs where we sat were pretty uncomfortable and from the bargain area...maybe some customers get out of control so they don't want decent chairs but separating the areas might help if that was an issue.",

We enjoyed both a Stella Artois and Guinness Blonde...both were on tap. The bartenders were friendly and from Ireland! Really gives you that Irish charm. If you like whiskey, they have a Tour of Ireland  for only $16. Prices are decent, and a bit cheaper than drinking in a casino. Perfect for pre-gaming.   The food, oh my, is excellent! We had the pub-favorite fish-n-chips, Guinness Beef stew, and shepherd's pie. Good size portions...kept me full all night long! Our server was very friendly and served us quickly, despite the fact that it's NYE week (so it's crowded here on the strip!) I ordered the fish-n-chips, so I'm going to highly recommend this entree.   There's live entertainment after 8 pm...plus TVs throughout the pub for sports. The ambiance is of a traditional Irish pub. I heard they bought this pub from Ireland, took it apart, and reassembled it here in Vegas. Authentic!  So, overall, I highly recommend this pub for good eats and drinks before hitting the casino floor!",

    "text": "The ratings on this place were so good I didn't bother reading any reviews, I assumed everything I ordered was going to be off the charts.  I live in So Cal so finding decent Irish/English food is a challenge, I was thrilled with the chance of finally getting some decent pub grub.  I ordered sausage rolls, scotch eggs and a pint of Harp. Boom, treat on its way...  What arrived on my table was the sorriest excuse for scotch eggs I have ever seen.  The eggs had a very thin (1/8\" or 3mm) coating of sausage making the entire egg not much bigger than a normal hard boiled egg.  Even worse, the eggs had been halved and made into deviled eggs.  They were downright f***ing nasty.  Next I tried the sausage rolls.  Now sausage rolls and I have had a love affair for 4 decades, I know exactly what constitutes a killer one.   These were sausage links covered in a very hard flaky pastry then smothered in a dijon mustard sauce...WTF!!!!!.  The links were hard and unflavorful and the sauce was horrible.  The pastry was so hard I believe they might have been yesterdays re-heated rolls.  Finally, it's hard to beat a pint of Harp but I got a 12oz not-very-cold beer in a not very appealing glass.  Irish/English pints are 20oz and lagers/pilsners etc are served ice cold.  $12 for each appetizer and $6 for the beer.  I paid $30+ tip for this pile of shit which really pissed me off.   To the owner, I hope you listen and care.  Scotch eggs need at least 3/4\" or 12mm of sausage around them and DO NOT cut them open.  A correct Scotch egg is about the size of a baseball/cricket ball.  Sausage rolls should be made from sausage meat and NOT links.  The pastry and sausage should be very soft and served without anything on them.  Put your sauce on the side if you must.  Watch some YouTube videos and learn how to make these important dishes correctly for crying out loud.",

I was suspicious that an Irish Pup got a 4 star rating on Yelp because in general the Irish don't know how to cook....sorry, lived there, traveled all counties and they are seriously lacking in culinary ability.   NOT SO GOOD...the ruben does not look like the first picture, but rather the second (the one I took). The house brined corned beef was chewy, a little oily, but flavorful. The sauerkraut and 'thousand island' dressing was super BLAND, could hardly taste those ingredients and didn't even know there was cheese on it.   The chicken and date salad WASN'T GOOD. The 'white balsamic vinegar' was WAY TOO STRONG and completely overpowered the whole salad. I put that in quotes because I'm pretty sure it was red wine or white wine vinegar because balsamic has a sweeter taste.  The only reason I would give this restaurant 3 stars is for two reasons.  FIRST,  the deviled scotch egg was AMAZING!! not sure how they got that perfect crust to stick to the hard boiled egg. SECOND, the service was GREAT!   I won't be back because there are way too many places in Vegas with the same 'genre' that I would try out first because Ri Ra was not all that.",

It was up to him where we were going to do Lunch and he suggested Ri Ra, an Irish eatery in the shops between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor.   Parking was a bit of a trip, finding it, that is. On the way there, we saw an Elvis impersonator on a scooter at a stop light, Pete Rose in a shop window signing baseballs and of course I found a stocking store, So those three things were a pretty good build up.   There was a short wait, and once we were seated, we found that the service was excellent, never once did our glasses go dry. We ordered appetizers of Scotch Eggs and Salmon - that's for the boys, not for me, and both were incredibly flavorful. The scotch eggs were SO GOOD.  Our main dishes were as varied as the personalities at the table, so I'll just tell you about mine. I got the Guiness Stew and Salad combo and while the price was reasonable, the portion size was quite decadent. I couldn't finish the stew! The flavors were so good!   The conversation was easy and the company was just as good! I was almost sad to leave, except.. not. It was time to get going on to the rest of our day! You can be sure that I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The atmosphere is awesome, great servers, great band and reasonable prices, a great find in the Las Vegas strip area. We made a reservation both times so we were seated almost immediately on both visits. The menu had a good selection of food and beer, even a lengthy section of imports.  The food is what really stands out here. On the first visit I had a lamb burger with rosemary and a side of sweet potato chips. I must say these were the BEST sweet potato fries/chips I've ever had! Second visit I had a sandwich which was also very good, again with a side of sweet potato chips. Not one person out of our 5 party table had any complaints about the food, drinks or service. If you are on the fence about going here take my advice, along with the many other positive reviews and check this place out!!",

    "text": "Wish I could give zero stars! I found this place on yelp so and my husband and I decided this would be our first stop on our way in to Vegas (we wanted to catch Sunday football). I looked this place up (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frira.com&s=2af8d47c5faf337a2e9eb5bf89d5a515579325e1993b83885ead41393c2deecf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rira.com</a>) found they have $4 carlsberg pints all day as well as football food specials.   Walked up and WE had to greet the girls at the wait stand (they literally just stood their and said nothing). We asked to sit in the bar.   Girl behind the bar acted very annoyed that I asked about the beer special and pretended like she knew nothing about it. She asked another bartender and he said \"I think carlsberg is the special\". Then when I asked about the football food specials she told me \"oh, that was only during the first year we were open\". I said well your website is definitely not up to date then. At that point she gave our \"table\" to another bar tender. We left. As you can see their website still has all the specials listed. Waste of time!",

Get the rewards card - worth the 3 minutes it takes to fill it out and you get discounts, complimentary food, etc in the future.  We just happened to walk by and see that Derek Warfield from Derek Warfield and the Young Wolftones was the live music that night. Of course, we jump into the pub and sit at the packed bar. Hubby bought several pints of perfectly poured Guinness, a couple which had the four leaf clover design on top, and I had a couple pints of cider. The special that night was mussels in a whiskey sauce. Let me tell you. I had just gotten back from RI and had fresh mussels and these mussels at Ri Ra were equally as fresh, and that whiskey sauce is what dreams are made of. Perfection.  The night was perfect, and it helped that a huge group of Star Wars convention-goers from the UK who were mildly intoxicated showed up and danced the night away with the rest of us.  We always go to Ri Ra for breakfast. At first their menu was smaller, but it didn't matter because everything was scrumptious. My hubby loves the full Irish breakfast complete with rashers and black and white pudding. I love their Classic American or the Kilcullen Omelete. Every tastes as traditional as it gets in the U.S., and it helps that they made the bar in Ireland and transferred all of it to Vegas.  I'll be honest, I've had food here that was okay and nothing exciting, but for the most part the food is great and the entertainment, especially when its a live band on a weekend night, is perfect for a night at the pub.",

A good number of the staff working there are actually from Ireland and are also some of the most friendly people I've met. The beer selection is very good with a wide variety of imported draft as well as bottles. (They carry an American beer that is brewed in Oregon that is one of my favorites called Rouge Dead Guy Ale. I highly recommend it.) Also, stop in if you're looking for a more than decent list of whiskey. They have live Irish bands that play live music every night of the week. The food is very good. Sausage rolls are done very well. Fish and chips....well, it's the size of your plate! Their curry chips pair up nicely with a good beer. I did have their Irish breakfast once and I was a little disappointed. It could very well be a bad luck one time thing, because everything else has been more than perfect all the other times I've went.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is not the place I would expect a great pub style establishment, and as a native of Minneapolis/St Paul, I had to compare Ri Ra to places that set the bar real high. What I have come to seek in a pub is a place with good food, affordable beer you can drink in large amounts while bullshitting with friends, prices that let the bar fill with regulars, and an atmosphere of cozy chaos. Bear this in mind.  My husband and I went with 2 other locals for the locals happy hour, and even with the deal, this pub was quite expensive for the food.   Pros:  - Lots of wonderful free soda bread, and all the import beers you might like from Britain and Ireland. - Very friendly, attentive and polite staff. - Easy to read in the Mandalay Mall thing. - Scotch Eggs! And damn delicious ones at that. All of the food was quite good.  Cons: - It's pricey. Even with a generous locals discount event it is too spendy to be a frequent haunt; which is rather at cross purposes with being a \"pub\". - Its huge, and it is loud. Very loud. Not \"band playing a set\" loud, or raucous conversation loud, but \"the radio is so loud we have to shout\" loud; which is rather at cross purposes with being a \"pub\". - It's authentic...like the Blarney Stone. All the parts are there, but it just sort of lacks the atmosphere that separates a pub from a bar that serves bangers. It's not a bad pub by Vegas standards, but the price point and tourist saturation will leave me hunting for a pub to call my local.",

Everyone is very friendly and I loved out waitress. She was friendly and easy to talk to. She was the one with the red hair. If you are reading this *waving dramatically* that's what she told us to do if we needed her. LOL  When I looked at the drink menu, this is what I found: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw?select=3XySGJO_Mi0dp1ym6WAGdw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0...</a> YAY! So I HAD to order it. It was pretty good. Came out very creamy. Here is a picture: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw?select=YEzDue885fvE9rS3XHNzcw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0...</a>  After reading the reviews, I had to order the Fish and Chips. I was VERY VERY glad that I did. This was the BEST BEST Fish and chips I every had. The fries that came with it was okay but that doesn't really matter. The Fish was incredible! It came out perfectly crispy and hot. The fish was scrumptious.   We also ordered the Yankee burger that was the special for the 4th of July weekend. Here is a picture: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw?select=AVc_MsyTfq_Qo1oISn2LuA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0...</a> The burger came out tasteful. It was surprisingly not dry. We got Sweet potato fries with it and there was no extra charge!! YAY! Loved the sweet potato fries. Came out nice and crispy. (if you read most of my reviews, I loved it when the food is crispy LOL) haha  We also ordered the Salmon. I didn't get the dish name but here is a picture: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw?select=isyE6oXJNOy3smL-JP_jdw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dWk0...</a> Our waitress recommended it and it was good. The Mashed potato was really good too.   I would totally recommend this place. Loved the food and atmosphere. They also have a REALLY large TV in the back room. Great for watching sports. Luckily we sat right in front of it.",

We started with the sausage rolls, which were outstanding.  The pastry was just like my grandmother used to make.  For our mains I had the lamb sandwich and the husband had the fish and chips.  My lamb was mostly tasty, but there was one piece in there that was thick and really, really tough, which made it hard to enjoy.  The husband said the fish and chips were fine - the fish came out as one huge single filet, as opposed to being cut up in pieces.  I can appreciate why they serve it in just one piece, but did make it a bit unwieldy to eat.  Sadly enough, the drinks were what let the experience down for us.  The husband had the Lagunitas IPA (I know, you're supposed to go for Irish beer.  But the husband doesn't like Irish beer) and it was flat.  I ordered their pink lemonade (Citron, chambord and pink lemonade) which was quite nice, but when I was less than a quarter of the way through my drink, I picked up my glass to take a sip and the bottom dropped out of the glass, splashing my drink and glass bits all over the table and me.  The staff (and neighbouring patrons) helped me wipe most of liquid off me and moved us to another table while the manager got me a new drink.  However, we got a quick apology and nothing more.  We didn't ask for anything, but we've been comped at least for a drink when anything similar has happened to us at other places.  A bit disappointing for customer service.",

There was no one else outside waiting though so we thought he was being a jerk.   We walked down the mall area for a few minutes looking at stores but then went to wait in front of the place again for fear we would miss our calling.   After a wait of over 45 minutes we were about to leave and go eat somewhere else but the guy pointed at us and let us know our table was ready.      We sat down and we had a pretty nice waitress who was on the ball and checked in with us often.    I ordered a Stella Artois beer and my husband Iced tea.    They were brought out quickly.    For dinner I ordered the Reuben and my husband the shepherds pie.   My one complaint is that they charge extra for sides which don't really amount to anything when they bring them out to you.  I ordered a ceasar side salad to go with my sandwich and it was basically a few small pieces of lettuce with 2 croutons on top.   The Reuben was pretty good.   Waitress made small talk as we were paying the bill which was nice however once I put my card in and she brought it back I set my beer down for a second to sign my name and she snatched my beer and all the other glasses and took them to the kitchen.   I still had about 3 drinks left in my glass so that irritated me since I'd spent good money to purchase a beer.   I took a dollar tip away for that .   Other than that a reasonable place to eat at in Mandalay Bay.  Just don't go during the Irish music segment if you aren't interested in hearing it because I read on the menu they charge a 20 percent surcharge of your total bill to hear the band play.   Glad we got out a few minutes before they started playing or it would have been an $8 dollar charge extra on top of all the other taxes and tips.",
