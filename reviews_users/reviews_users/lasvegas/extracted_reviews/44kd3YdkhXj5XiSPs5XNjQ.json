    "text": "Just don't.  For few hundred dollars I'd expect good food and service  We were charged extra for ordering French onion soup with our meal- that came with soup or salad, when we asked about it, the response was that \"French onion is and upgraded soup, it comes in a crock\". Why wasn't that mentioned when we had a conversation about it with the server when it was ordered?  My son had to take his steak home to flavor it. My daughter in law had to take her steak home to not only flavor it but continue cooking it  (the server did send it back to be reheated after it was brought to his attn when everyone else was done eating)  Husband asked for Demi for his ribeye after he realized it was flavorless  and was told they don't have a Demi--- the three other meals that were ordered all had a Demi..W.  don't waste the extra $3 to upgrade to a wedge salad  I ordered the filet medallions- if you want these, Montana meat company has a great medallion appetizer as well as  great service  Apps-- lettuce wraps were ok. Wouldn't order them again. The philly steak rolls (according to rest of table) weren't bad but didn't taste like philly steaks.  The chicken fired steak bites were good. IMO the only good thing from the entire meal  I must not be educated on lobster Mac (had no lobster)but the Reg Mac and cheese was better which isn't saying a whole lot (save your $20!) Everyone loved the bread. Had a sweet hint to it The baked sweet potato was good  So recap -  cons- all the meals, most of the appetizers, and most of the sides..May have all been better had we had drinks with the meal to cover up the lack of taste The bathroom was pretty foul. The only clean-ish toilet stall didn't lock.  And the service was subpar. Expected more from this place I guess  Pros- chicken fried steak bites. Baked sweet potato.   So if you want good service head across the street to Montana meat company.  If you want a better steak (sadly) head to outback",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. Our server was Michelle, and she was amazing. All the staff was very fun, nice, and personable. I just wish the food was up to par with their service.   We went out for a late night dinner on a Saturday night. I ordered the filet wrapped in bacon, with a salad, and the lobster/crab Mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries, and my dad a NY strip with the loaded baked potato soup, and mashed potatoes.   I ordered my filet medium, and the chef cooked it perfectly. Unfortunately, the taste of the steak was so overwhelming, with what seemed to be liquid smoke. I am not sure how they cook their steaks, but whatever smoky flavor they added or cooked the steaks on was absolutely overwhelming. I felt like I was eating a bottle of liquid smoke. Steak is simple... Salt and pepper with a good compound butter is all it needs.   I dipped my steak in the butter that was provided with the bread. Luckily, that took away some of that powerful smoky flavor. The lobster and crab Mac and cheese tasted okay... But the crab meat tasted like the imitation crab, which was extremely disappointing. I've ate a lot of different seafood Mac and cheeses from other restaurants, and they have never tasted like I was eating a can of tuna.   My dads NY strip was basically all fat, and slightly over cooked. He only ate a few bites, and we gave the rest to my dog. His steak was also extremely overwhelming with that liquid smoke taste. My boyfriends burger was average, and nothing to be amazed by.   I honestly think with a few changes in the kitchen this restaurant could be a great addition to the centennial area.",

    "text": "The bad: The food was bland. There is nothing unique about it. No cheese on the mashed potatoes, nothing to set the flavor apart. We had steak and the \"steak tips\" (can't remember the exact name) with mushrooms and sauce. It tasted like bland meat placed in sauce. We had wings as an appetizer the flavor was good but they were tough. Also I did not care for the look of the inside. There is nothing that says fire. It looks like an old people restaurant but the tables have paper and crayons for kids. It's like they tried something new but it's not working makes the restaurant seem cheap. Pick a theme and go with it.  The good: the bread was warm and tasted good. The food was warm. The waiter was nice. The food didn't take too long to come out.",

Starting with the hostess staff who are more interested in their own gossip than giving you realistic wait times.  So,  if you get a wait time from this staff, make sure you add a solid 20-30 minutes to whatever you were told.   Oh and when you finally get seated? Expect to be straight up ignored by everyone else until you decide to leave.   Thanks for ruining date night!  I hope this review helps any future poor souls from making the same mistake we did.",

I came to dinner not the club.  Music also a bit inappropriate for the atmosphere. Again, not a dance club.  Service by our particular waitress pretty horrible. No refills, just brought out check when we all wanted dessert.  Kids macaroni and cheese was like soup with a hair in it. Sent it back and not much improved on the second round minus the hair.

Also, that being said, opt for the higher quality steak. The basic cuts aren't worth it. Also, if you want to make a reservation they won't set it any less than at least an hour in advance. I dock another star because I called to set a reservation and asked if I could get a reservation an hour from the current time. The woman on the phone told me the current time was an hour later than it actually was. I checked my phone and told her the current time, and she told me I was wrong. I came in and the woman didn't even place my reservation. Luckily the wait wasn't too long, but not the best first impression.",

    "text": "My wife and I eat out just about every night. Since this is very close to our home, we've eaten there 10-12 times. And Aug. 31 is going to be the final time. It is extraordinarily slow and the service isn't very good.  We walked in last night at 6:20 p.m. There were people waiting, but it was obvious from looking around the dining room that seats were available. The hostess told us the wait was 20-25 minutes, so we decided to wait. We got called for our table at 7:08.   As we were led to our table, there had to be 15 tables/booths open, which made one question why it took so long.  When we sat down, the waiter came over reasonably quickly. My wife had a drink I'd walked up to the bar to get, but I had nothing. Took 15 minutes for me to get a glass of iced tea. It was long to order, then it was very long before our food came out.  My experience has been that the food is good, certainly not great. On this particular visit, my wife had the cedar plank salmon (which I've had numerous times) and I had the bacon-wrapped filet. My filet and the grilled vegetables were good. It was a solid B. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the salmon, as I have when I've had it in the past.  They serve rolls with the meal in the pan, but our rolls were cold (butter wouldn't melt on them).  The waiter was pleasant, but slow, and didn't make any major mistakes.  But all in all, we were in there for two hours and paid $90 (including tip) for our meal.  The long waits make it not worth it for me. We won't be going back any time soon. I recommend the Montana Steakhouse, which is just up the street. It's cheaper, the service is way, way, way better and it's quick. The food is very comparable, too, and in some cases better.  I never say never, but I'm going to give FireRock a six-month break to allow them to work out the kinks.",

Our appetizer (philly cheesesteak egg rolls) came out  \"smaller than usual\" (manager's words) and a second plate was sent out on the house (we thought the first plate was more than adequate).  The salads were fresh and the steak was flavorful and cooked exactly as ordered.  Great steakhouse, affordable prices and amazing customer service. I can't understand why there are some bad reviews for this restaurant--we either caught the restaurant on a lucky day or they have changed their services...either way we will go back for another round!",

Twice my credit card bill had in incorrect amount I was charged..of course it was higher than it was to be. How about a $50. Tip on a $40 bill. It happened twice. I was told the server puts the amount of the bill plus tip in the computer. No control by management meaning the server can boost their tip which is what happened twice. I can not return due to crooked unethical business practices.. Why do I need to be embarrassed to get it corrected or have a dispute with my credit card company? Also the service went downhill.  It takes forever to get someone to come to your table to take an order. I was told that 2 servers  were assigned to my table but neither came. They were mostly empty at 7 pm on a Saturday night. Now I know why. Bad all around.",

The ladies at the front were pleasant, nice greet and we were seated within 5-7mins with no reservation and they were somewhat busy. Our server seemed to be overwhelmed with taking care of so many tables that the simple things were forgotten: no refills on our drinks, didn't ask how our food was, no recommendation since it's our families first time, no wine suggestion (I normally would prefer a wine pair with my meal order). It wasn't personable and not much interaction or care. The food was good but not the best I've had. It will be a while til we ever consider coming back. My 6 years old rated this place 3/5, she's my diningout buddy: She did not enjoy the grilled cheese sandwich from the kid menu, too greasy, hard and a bit burnt. I ended up taking home a box. Although, she did enjoy drawing on the table. Lol",

They have a good happy hour with food items ranging from $5-$8 and drinks can vary, of course, depending on what you like.  I've had their martini and wines and for approx $5-$6 each.   This place is PACKED as early as 3pm.  We've had the great pleasure of having Luis as our server the past two weeks.  I don't think Friday's are his regular days which is disappointing but regardless he has been amazing.  As mentioned, this place is packed and the service he provides  is not affected.  If you have not yet tried this place, I recommend if it is not over happy hour.  Their regular prices are not all too bad either.  More than an Outback, less than a standard Steakhouse.",

As appetizers we had, calamari, wings and firecracker shrimp.  All bad. Wings were just not good, shrimp was awful and calamari was marginal at best.    2.  While eating the apps my wife spots ants crawling up the wall. I get a manager, we show her the ants and she says sorry. We move ourselves to another table without making a scene.  They cleaned the table, never did anything about the ants and sat the same table again while we were there.   3. Entrees were nasty. Ribs were cooked way to long and were dry. My wife's spaghetti with meat sauce had very little sauce and no flavor. Plus there were carrots in the sauce. Big chunks of carrots!    4. Server behind us drops a drink. Not a big deal as it happens. But the drink splashed all over my wife's leg and no one even acknowledged it.   Tab was $120 but we got a lot of food. Bad part was all of it was awful.  We love eating out and try to see the best in everything. This was just bad all around.",

    "text": "FireRock is the crossroads of fine and casual dining. This review, shares my first hand experience enjoying the blending of fine and casual dining in FireRock.       It was my brother who recommended FireRock. We had finished hiking up in the Bristlecone Trail, when my brother who lives in the north part of the valley recommended this place. The food is so good that he has been here a few times since it replaced Shoney's last year.      One of the reasons that I never heard of FireRock besides the fact that I live in the opposite side of the valley is that this is the only other location. The original FireRock location is in Casper, Wyoming.     When we walked inside the steakhouse around 7 pm on a Saturday, it was busy. Instantaneously my olfactory scent caught the delicious smell of grilling steak over an open flame. Concurrently, the hostess informed us of a 30 minute wait. During the wait, I took in the interior scenery. The interior design was cookie cutter at the same time it was elegent. My eyes took in wood, stone, pictures, lamps, and a central bar. At the crossroads of casual and fine dining, I observed well dressed couples on dates to families dressed in jeans and t-shirts. There was nothing stuffy or phony about this restaurant.      After the hostess yelled out \"Daniel party of two,\" she walked us to our table. A few minutes further our waiter introduced himself by saying his name at the same time that he wrote it in crayon on the table cloth. My mind would be on what to order.      The expansive menu offered choices from the spectrum of casual to fine dining. At the fine dining level were the Angus beef steaks and seafood. At the casual dining level the abundant choices included varieties of cheeseburgers, a Ruben, BLT, pasta dishes, Philly cheese steak, and so on. From years of experience, I am cognizant of the fact that steakhouses serve first-rate hamburgers. Regardless, deciding what to order was difficult. I decided that I was going to order the delicious steak sandwich that he told me about. On the other hand ordering the drink was easy. I ordered a Coke.      Our waiter placed a bowl of hot just baked house bread on the table. It held us over until he brought the next bowl of bread on the table that held us over to dinner. There were a few things that he would neglect to place on the table. I would have to ask him for my tableset of a napkin with utensils. After my food arrived, I had to ask for ketchup. The following paragraph leads off with the biggest bloop.      I ordered the steak burger where my brother ordered the BBQ pork sandwich. In a turn of events that would lead to me reviewing my first BBQ pork sandwich, a second waiter delivers our food to the table. He asks who ordered the burger. Apparently he confused a steak burger with the pork sandwich causing a swap in our orders. After I took my first bite it was the point of no return.     The first BBQ pork sandwich that I recall eating tasted fine. Between two warm challah buns, the sandwich overflowed with slow roasted pork, bacon, peanut Cole slaw, and caramelized pepper. There was just the right amount of barbecue sauce. I did not have to keep reaching for a napkin to wipe sticky sauce off my hand. The BBQ pork sandwich is certainly quality. I could just imagine how delicious the steak burger across the table from me was. Or the burgers that my brother alleged are huge. Instead of reaching for a napkin, my hands were reaching for the steak fries that took up half the dish. The steak fries nicely complimented the sandwich.     The prices are another example of casual meeting fine dining. The steaks and seafood at the upper tier of the menu is what you'd expect to pay for them. At the bottom tier the prices are competitive with Danny's. Here are a couple of examples. The cheeseburgers average $10.50. The steak burger is $11.50. And the BBQ pork sandwich that I ordered is $9.50. I will argue that the dining environment here is much nicer than Denny's.    After we left FireRock and walked in the parking lot overlooking US 95 and a KFC, I was in a good mood. FireRock served me a competitively priced diner that even though it was the wrong order tasted fantastic in a casual and classy setting. If I lived as close to FireRock as my brother does, there would be followup visits to try their steak burger, one of their cheeseburgers, and possibly steak. Hopefully I will be back in FireRock in the future.",

    "text": "This was our first time here. Wait was almost 55 minutes on Friday night at 6pm. Waiting area is nice, decent sized. We were seated towards the back. The place is decorated very nice for the holidays. Our server, Ryan, was kind, attentive, and generally did a good job. Two of us had Filet Oscar and one had a Roast Beef sandwich. Homemade rolls, fresh out of the oven were great. Salads were good. We had the sampler appetizer which was a good choice. Loved the artichoke dip and Calamari. The stuffed mushrooms were a little soft, but flavor was good.  The entrees arrived in a reasonable time. Excellent flavor in the steaks. My only real criticism was that Fire Rock Chefs are too heavy with sauces. The Baked Potato I had and my wife's sweet potato was drowning in butter. The Bernaise sauce on our steaks while wonderful in flavor, and the crab pieces were nice, there was just too much sauce, almost to the point of detracting from the steak. We will go back but next time We will know to ask for much less butter, and much less sauce. The flavor of our food was very good. A party one table over had ordered Lobster tails, they were huge and looked very good. I will try them on our next visit. Overall we enjoyed our visit to FireRock. Next time, cut back on the amount of butter and sauce, and it would be even better.",

He ABSOLUTELY loved his dish, and he referenced the flavor as fish ice cream...sounds gross, but the creamy sauce was had the right amount of sweet that complimented the fish well. The size of the fish could've been an ounce bigger.   My dish was a combination of country fried steak with  a 1/3 rack of ribs. The seasoning of the batter and crisp of the country fried steak had my tastebuds jumping for joy! The ribs had a nice taste, but I found my rack to be a bit dry.   We had a wonderful waitress! She was attentive, funny and considerate.   Overall, it was a nice dining experience. I do like that they have daily specials because it gives us the opportunity to explore the menu without breaking the bank!",

It came out cold and I had to ask for au jus because it was so dry. A friend had fried shrimp and lobster mac & cheese. There was more breading than shrimp. The mac & cheese was cold and pretty much  inedible. Another had a club sandwich. Tasted like everything had just came out of the refrigerator. Another had a top sirloin that had the texture of shoe leather. The kids cut of top sirloin looked okay. Unsure of how good it was as she is 9 yrs old. The French fries came out when we were almost done. The waitress mentioned that they were busier than expected. There were maybe 10 tables. $100 for lunch. We would have been better if we had gone to McDonalds. So sad because this restaurant used to be so good.",

However, our server Chaz (Chas) didn't seem to interested in being present at all.  When I ordered my drinks, I didn't receive my coffee, and my orange juice was actually a Mimosa.  When this was pointed out to our server, it was clear he had no interest in fixing the mistake.  When he did, his attempt at humor by saying that my orange juice was sans champagne came off more condescending than anything.    The food was not prepared to order as my wife's poached eggs were soft as opposed to the medium she ordered, and my over hard eggs were medium.  The portions they give you for the price were good, but, the only reason I was full was from the massive pancakes.  However, I was not impressed with the food, and I was definitely unimpressed with our server's attitude.  No complaints were made thanks to the reviews here that clearly show that management doesn't care about providing high quality customer service.  If they weren't willing to do that for people weeks earlier, I'm certain they wouldn't be willing to do it today.  Make up your own opinion on the place, I however was unimpressed.  We might return to try the dinner menu in hopes that the service will be better.",

Yesterday, a lady, dressed in a black pants suit, walked around like a manager might, but never said hi or even looked our way.

Asparagus was hard as a rock. I ordered the side Mac and cheese....didn't receive it till my meal was almost over ...my daughter couldn't get her water refilled. .and only came to check on us once....now for a $130 for 5 people price I felt we should have gotten better service.  I have been to plenty steak houses before and this was by far below average at best...meal came to and end and the manager Miranda did try to make it right after explaining my frustrations....she said she would remove the $3 dollar macaroni and since it was wife's birthday she would throw in a cake for us to take home.   We were very pleased with the gesture and said no, but she insisted so we were like ok...how nice.... unfortunately she failed at this....we paid ...washed up.... Took two very old ladies to the car and waited and waited and waited....15 minutes ... 20 min gone by....my wife waited at the table as everyone else was in the car....finally I called her and told her enough....they couldn't even get that right .   Let go home....Miranda was no where to be found ...no cake....no eff you....no thank u for coming..... Nothing .... Broken promise is a no no in the food industry..failure at it's highest level.....I made her leave....this place fell flat on their face....my wife's birthday was a total bust.   So disappointed because I Truely wanted to like this place....need some training on how to be an upscale steakhouse . .best if luck in the future......",

Our second visit we came for my husband's birthday in January '18 and brought our three teenagers. Everyone's food appeared to have sat under a heat lamp for some length of time, probably while finishing one of the dishes in the order. Sauces were congealed and had skins, meat was dry, my vegetable medley was absolute mush, and they somehow managed to make basmati rice taste awful. The third time, this past week, we took just two of our kids and had the same issues with dried out meat, congealed sauce with skin, and cheddar mashed potatoes that tasted like dishwater. The only part of the meal that was good was the bread rolls at the start, we didn't even bother to take home the leftovers. Atmosphere is nice, employees are attentive, but it's just too expensive to keep giving them one more chance.",

The sampler platter was okay. I like the stuff mushrooms, but the rest was alright.  The Blue cheese burger here is super good. The ONLY thing I would change is the bread. It's very spongeyish. I would like to have softer bread, but the patty itself is awesome.   Happy to come back and try out some other stuff.   But again - the music. Good god, it's horrible here. Last night, it was 80's...and not the good 80's music.   Also, it was super cold. It had to be on 65 degrees and we were freezing. I'm always cold and my boyfriend is always hot. And if he's cold, you know it's got to be freezing.",

We (as senior citizens) ordered the pulled pork appetizer  and only asked the waiter (who was great and caring and should be the manager!), and only asked to put the pulled pork, the cheese and other items separate from the chips, as to not get the chips soggy.  The pulled pork looked like SLOP pulled out from a bucket of I don't know what!!! It looked like cold oatmeal and it was cold AND no cheese or  tomatoes or sour cream topping or guacamole topping, as if the presentation of this they could care less!!!!! We have tried 3 times with this same order and this is NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!!! We were told by the waiter that the manager was coming over to discuss ''this and he ( manager) was too busy with a neighboring table and of course very non manager quality! Give the position to the caring young waiter! Signed  Third time is not a charm!!!!",

There were 7 of us at our table, and after receiving our first round of sodas and waters, it took forever to get them refilled, even after asking a hostess, the manager, and a different server.  For our food, one was served food that she was allergic to, two others' orders weren't how they ordered them, and another didn't get served the same time as the others - our child.  When we mentioned to the person delivering the food, she simply said, \"oh, I'm sure it will be out\".  When the manager returned, he asked how our experience was going, so I told him.  Then after it was all over, we weren't even offered a free desert for the table to share or anything for our troubles.  Not sure if they had desert anyway as I wasn't offered any. First time visiting and unfortunately probably won't be returning again.",

I must say, this was one of the best dining experiences my wife and I had in a long time.  Portions were very filling and of great quality and taste.

My real reason for giving the 5 STARS is the service we received from a young man on his game.   Tyrone gave us the most amazing service I have ever received from any restaurant. Very attentive, great personality and I really can't say enough.   I suggest you come for yourself and request Tyrone.",

    "text": "First time here at Fire Rock Steakhouse.  I had it bookmarked for quite a while because I see it as we go to Sam's Club.  Dad was in town and wanted Steak so I said let's give this a whirl. Went on a Friday night.  Pretty crowded but no wait time. Our waitress was awesome (of course I NEVER remember names). We all ordered and waited for the yummy bread everyone rants about.  I LOVE BREAD.  I was a tad disappointed.  The middle was a little too soft for me.  Almost like it wasn't done all the way.   Salad was super yum and their balsamic dressing OMG.  I could've drank that. The steaks come out cooked to perfection for each of us, however there was NO seasoning what so ever.  All a steak needs is a little salt and pepper.  Nope, nothing.  I rarely add salt to my food and the fact that I added quite a bit says a lot. Do I need to go back?  Probably not.  The restaurant itself was nice and so was the atmosphere but definitely wouldn't get another steak here unfortunately.",

She is definitely in the right business! We did have to Wait a bit for her to arrive at our table but she looked very busy. The host was very nice, he wasn't standing there when we arrived and didn't offer us a kids menu but overall he was very personable.   The interior is fabulously decorated and comfortable. The menu has some of the greatest choices of food and very reasonably priced.   The carpet under our table was destroyed, when we first sat down my foot got stuck underneath the carpet and table, it caused me to panic for a second.  That really needs to be fixed!!   The bathroom was super clean and they have stools or kids to reach the sinks to wash with.  Loved that!   Our food was pretty good, my house salad was huge and the crotons are delicious!! I got the patty melt, I wasn't a huge fan of the bread and the burnt cheese on top.  The crust was to hard to chew through, I cut the edges off and ate the burger.   My sons steak and fries were good, we did ask for it to be well done and it came out  medium. He still ate it and enjoyed it.  My husband also got the steak and potato soup. He really liked the creamy soup and liked the steak.   I'll come back, the menu has many choices and I want to try the cheesecake!!",

    "text": "This is my updated review and sadly I must give them 1 star and I will not be back. I have tried to give FireRock Steakhouse so many chances but the food is never consistent. This past experience was probably the worst I have had with them.   It was my mom birthday and she just wanted to stay home but not cook dinner so we decided to get takeout from here. Now, I've ordered steak as take out many times from different places so I didn't see this as being a problem. I honestly feel really bad because my moms dinner was terrible and she ended up throwing away her food because it lacked any type of flavor and it was so over cooked she couldn't chew it.   This is what we ordered:   1. Cowboy Bone In Ribeye, ordered it rare, gratin potatoes, and baked potato soup. The steak was so raw not rare with absolutely no sear on top or any type of seasoning that would give it flavor. I've extremely bothered by the fact that the chef who works at a Steakhouse does not know the difference between rare and a raw ice cold steak. We actually had to put it back on the stove at home. The side was just ok nothing special. The best part of this meal was the soup.   2. 12oz Sirloin Steak, ordered it medium, white cheddar mashed potatoes, and a side salad. Again the steak was not cooked at the right temperature. It was so well done my mom couldn't chew it and ended up throwing it away. The mashed potatoes were ice cold in the center and not very good. Best part of this meal I was told was the salad.   3. 6oz Sirloin and Grilled Shrimp, ordered it medium, white cheddar mashed potatoes, baked potato soup. This was my entree and my steak was so over cooked I could barely cut into it and consuming it was impossible unless I wanted to have a sore jaw. My potatoes were so so and cold. The grilled shrimp were the best part of the meal but nothing to talk about. My soup also just ok and a bit greasy.   $120 meal pretty much went into the garbage. I'm officially done giving this place another chance. I won't be back. I can't spend good money hoping I go on a \"good\" day and that the chef knows how to cook a steak at the correct temperature.",

I asked the Mgr. Emily,  She said \"Oh I don't know, I'll bring it up to the head chef in the morning.\" I'm here now....Duh moment. I really don't like sending food back that is etible, because it will end up in the trash.  So 1 star for Emily and if possible 5 stars for the team that took one for management.  WTH.",

But tonight, we couldn't decide what we wanted and it caught my eye.  Happy hour from 3-6, kid friendly, tasty looking menu and (when I called) hockey on many tv's.   Sure.  Let's check it out!   The hubs, my 5 year old and I got a table near a huge tv showing hockey (just like they said they'd do when I called).   It's a cute place.   Very bright, clean, and relaxed, but white table cloths (covered in paper so you can color and draw).  I was surprised at how nice it is.  We had a great server (Stephen), who gave perfect descriptions and recommendations.  Lots of fun choices for happy hours apps and drinks.   It's a steak house with lots of predictable options, but also had some fun and different things too.     Kids menu has quite a bit on it and is very reasonably priced.   The kiddo chose grilled cheese with a side of fruit (fresh cut melon and grapes) and apple juice for $3.95 (I think).   Hubs got the French cut pork chop.   It was great!   Cooked perfectly with a side of fresh green beans and mashed potatoes.  I got the chimichuri steak sandwich which was wonderfully bright.   Steak cooked just right and the bread was delish!   Two cocktails, an appetizer, two adult entrees and kiddo food was just over $60.   Very affordable and perfectly delicious!   Thanks for the great dinner!!",

We tried to get our waitress so we could get another one because we're not eating fat.... took like 20 min. Then she tells us the manager will be over. After a long time she just says I put in another steak and the manager will be over. By the time we got the other steak it was close to 10pm, the manager never came over. Nothing was discounted and no one seems to care much. I would never waste my money here and will never recommended this place. And at the end the waitress left and another guy took over.

When it did arrive it was so greasy and burnt that she did not bother to eat it.  That was just one part of the order that did not show up until we had almost finished eatting.

From the customer service (which was great over the phone & in person), to the location (a quiet area in Centennial Hills and the food, this place is hands down a must try. My coworker and I ordered by phone, and he opted for the steak & shrimp, (18.95) while I ordered the BBQ pulled pork nachos (10.95). The portions were ridiculous. The steak & shrimp came with a large side of mashed potatoes, a medium sized salad, and a giant bowl of bread. The nachos were so huge I had enough for lunch the next day. Service was fast, the location was clean and beautifully decorated, and I am on my way there right now to order again. Go eat here! Its amazeballs!",

They have a private dining room great wine huge bar and very comfortable seating. We got the warm spinach salad for an appetizer delicious chicken feta and dressing on it. Husband had steak kabobs which were a little undercooked but good non the less. I had a chicken dish that was basically a cordon bleu without the deep fried chicken instead they thought it was absolutely delicious. Macaroni and cheese to die for. Will definitely come back to this restaurant when we are doing business on that side of town. Kayla was our waitress and made a good meal great.  Ask for her . Sunday brunch spot for sure and I'm sure is romantic at night.",

Nice ambiance w/jazz music playing...just loud enough to be noticeable but easy to talk over.  We have to say service from server Anjanette was xcellent.  She is a keeper. She knew the menu & answered questions about some items, with highly helpful & friendly manner. Also was very much on the ball with beverage refills. Our only service quibble seemed not her fault...for such little business at the time and for what we ordered it seemed it took a bit long for the kitchen to produce.    I had the NY Strip sandwich (sans mushrooms), cooked just right, reasonably tender and nice size. It had good flavor.  The side dish of pineapple & strawberries was a welcome & tasty option.      My guest ordered the Fish & Chips, which she said were good. The chips were good but the accompanying cole slaw was a small portion of greens with little flavor & no vinegar, so that definitely needs work.  The fish was good and cooked right but nothing special overall.      There are some other menu items of interest we will return to try after definitely giving them a bit more shakedown time.  The potential here is great and FireRock was much needed in the neighborhood so we're happy they've come.",

Our waitress was cordial at best, and seemed rushed and disinterested throughout our meal. I ordered a glass of red wine for $12. The wine had obviously been refrigerated and had been open for at least a few weeks. I politely told the waitress and asked for a new glass. She returned and told me the bartender insisted he had just opened the bottle - blatant lie. No apology. The dinner was inedible. I ordered a sirloin medium rare (served medium well), a sweet potato, broccoli and the beet salad. Everything was so over seasoned that my lips actually burned. My husband liked it (he loves salt) and had diarrhea all night.",

Ordered desert.   Well let's just say it was ok at best but not outstanding. And for all my trouble and screwed up order. At least the manager did come and check to see if my steak was cooked right. Needless to say this is a reminder of why I don't go there.",

My favorite drink is the habeneiro margarita. The service definetly got better also, would definitely eat here again.",

And the entrees were so phenomenal that we couldn't pick! Everything sounded good. The scallops are superb and the chicken fried steak reminds you of home. The steak of course like everything else was divine. And the dessert was probably the best part. Some people say the service isn't good but I beg to differ. We had Sammy as our server and he gave his opinion about the food and he was so kind. And when we got the bill we were way off of how inexpensive it is. I strongly recommend going to FireRock for a nice dinner.",

Outside was soggy, coleslaw had no mayo on it. Plain shredded cabbage. We had to ask hostesses for things our table needed and the manager to take back the patty melt.

To start it took 20 minuets to get a glass of water and a full hour to get the salad.  And it was definitely was not the fault of the working as hard as possible overloaded staff!    Then one person in our party ordered the Pork Chop. \"Sorry sir we're out of Pork Chops\". Your kidding right? The start of Memorial Day Weekend, the place is packed and the kitchen is missing a key entree?  Two people ordered the 12 oz Rib Eye. Much more fat than normal and the flavor was borderline at best. Over 6 ounces remained on each plate. It was a cheap cut of beef, period!    The beet tenderloins revived good marks.   We should have followed our instincts and walked out after waiting so long.

Breakfast was okay, everything cooked well however on the way out I asked the bartender if he was able to make sugar cookie martinis. Not for breakfast but I was looking for a place for a holiday drink later and the bartender was rude and short with me and basically made me feel like an idoit for even asking. I thought bartenders were supposed to be friendly and accommodating. I looked up the drink recipe and it seemed pretty easy to make. Milk, bailey's, vanilla vodka and amaretto.  Pretty sure every bar has that. 3 stars because this place is average and not accommodating for have a full bar set up. I might go back. Might not.",

    "text": "Decided to give Firerock a try Friday night.  Upon entering to visit with the hostess the bar was packed and several tables were seated.  After a few moments wait our group was seated near the back of the restaurant in a booth.  Looking around at the room checking out the decor I notice they have a lot of photos and artwork of cows and western themed pieces.  FireRock definitely is a slight step up from casual dining but not quite fine dining status.  They do however have a private party room off to the left of the entrance with seating for at least 20 peeps.    Service started with beverages and some complimentary fresh baked buttery herb dinner rolls.  these were warm and very tasty start to our meal.  Browsing the menu I had trouble deciding on what to get because there were so many different things that had me salivating.  After seeking a recommendation from the server I decided to settle on the Chicken Dijonnaise as my entree with grilled asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes. This dish tasted as good as it sounds.  The panko breading was crisp and flavorful and the breast was large enough for me to take home a lunch portion for the next day.  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and I enjoyed the occasional lumps in the creamy fluffiness. the grilled asparagus was a perfect al dente and nice side item offering.   We also selected the Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Pasta with a light garlic and wine sauce.  I liked the freshness of the basil in the dish however the sun-dried tomatoes flavor seemed a little off. Normally these are sweet little bits of garden candy.  Don't get me wrong the dish was still tasty with its large slice of garlic bread on the side.  Once again another large portion that we had to take home to enjoy the next day.    I added a side salad to my Chicken entree which was just ok.  I was slightly underwhelmed with the amount of toppings which were diced so small it was hard to enjoy.  Overall not enough toppings of cucumber, tomato, egg, and bacon.  Even the dressing was a little to light.    Service from the staff was lightning fast. Almost uncomfortable because he would come in to the table so quickly with \"Hi how are we doing\" and then phew! he was gone.  I had to stop and have a conversation just make it feel like we were be attended to.  This was fine but sometimes when the staff run so frantically they either have to many tables or are understaffed.   Overall experience was positive.  I would definitely recommend Giving FireRock a try.  The Atmosphere was lively on a Friday night, food was good and service was expedited quickly.  I wanna try and come for Happy Hour from 4-6pm where drinks and apps are half price.",

    "text": "I love this restaurant. It is everything you want in a steak house experience without the Strip price points. It is a Nevada style bar so there are poker machines at the bar but other than that it fantastic. The wait staff is dressed and trained like a four and a half star place. I have eaten here several time and while I usually enjoy their Centennial Hills Special which offers a steak, salad or soup, and a desert, my wife has had many of their selections and found their prime rib when available fantastic. The thing that makes this restaurant though is their bread. It is world class. I don't know what they are doing back there but they better not change a thing it is as soft as warm butter and melts in the mouth. Dinning room is beautiful and you will not be restrained Ted by whatever might be happening in the bar on the TVs. Don't pass it up well worth the time and value for your money when you want steak!",

The service can be slow, it seems like they under staff sometimes. The bartenders are very nice. It isn't cheap but I keep coming back because of the food.   Update Nov 2017  We've been back several times and the service seems to be on a steady decline. I sat at the bar this evening for 11 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. It was 14 minutes from the time I sat down to the time I had a drink in front of me. Unacceptable. This isn't the first time, it's become the norm here and it's really disappointing. I've heard other customers complain about the same thing.",

I asked for a chocolate martini and normally they are ok at happy hours but this one,  was awesome,  made by Brie. The wine selection for the happy hour is great. It's all the popular food ones,  like Carnivor, Dark Horse ants La Creme. Definitely coming back and trying out their infused vodkas!",

So I ate what I could paid the bill and left. Come to think of it the Cajun steak should have had some seasoning right? Not this one.

We sampled most of the menu, which was quite extensive. The meatballs were juicy and perfectly cooked. The mussels were sweet and tender. The steak quesadilla was super tasty and extra cheesy; exactly how I like it! The nachos were good, but I didn't like the bbq sauce idea on the nachos but my husband really loved that flavor blend. The calamari had a great spicy tang and tasted really fresh. The firecracker shrimp were tasty, but the sauce became overwhelming; I'd prefer the sauce as a dip! The jalapeno crunch burger was super tasty  and perfectly executed flavors and appearance!",

We didn't see our server more than 3 times during the entire hour we were there, our orders were wrong, and I could go on but overall we just didn't have the great experience we expected.

(That's the only reason why they got 2 stars) We waited over an hour and 15 mins to get our meal.  Sad to say their colossal potato wasn't \"colossal\"as they claimed.  The waitress apologized for the wait and there was a mix up in the back. She said that the meal would be comped and a Manager would come over to check on us. We almost walked out just before the waitress came by to tell us about the mix up, but because the meal was being cooked and was being comped we hesitantly stayed. We did not complain or make a stink, because we understand things happen.  Then we got our food, the Manager stopped by and wanted to see if there was anything else he could get us.  Thinking that we already have the meal comped we didn't want to take advantage of the generosity and told him that there was nothing else we wanted or needed.  Then we get the bill and it was not comped like the waitress stated earlier. Instead they took $14 off the bill.  We will not be back. And I would suggest that they not lie to their customers.",

    "text": "I wanted to give a good review, I'm sorry I can't. When we walked in the door, we were instantly confused. The atmosphere is of a high end steakhouse, but there are enough loud tv's to be a sports bar. With all the sports bars and sports books here, no one would come here to watch a game... and they kill the steakhouse feel. When we went to the bar while waiting on our table. The service was slowww. The bartender ignored us. We were helped by the service-tender, between him filling orders for the waitresses. Our booth was nice and comfortable for 4 people, but the table was small.  The salads were good, but slow arriving. So, of course, the meal arrived way too soon. I HATE THAT. So do you forget the salad and start eating the hot food, or finish the salad and eat a cold steak? Or send the food back to sit under a heatlamp? And remember the small table?!!!!!! Person #1- the pasta was boring. Person #2- the burger and mushrooms were overlooked. Person #3- the steak was flavorless and tasted microwaved. Person #4 (me)- the bacon filet was small. Cut several times on the edge (obviously checking for done-ness). Dry and rubbery. And it looked smaller than it actually was because there was no garnish to fill the blank area of the large plate (O platter presentation). The waitress did come check on us several times, but NEVER prebused, even though I DID and used plates were stacked! Did I mention the small table? My friend ordered a vodka martini at the bar, very nice presentation. When he ordered his second at the table, it was a shot of vodka in a cocktail glass with his olives carried separately in her other hand. Well, we were all so overit by this point, he just poured the shot in his empty martini glass and tossed in the olives. When we want a high-end lounge, we will go elsewhere.... When we want a steakhouse, we will go elsewhere... When we want a sportsbar, we will go elsewhere...",

    "text": "The food was alright, nothing great about it. Our server was Kahla (Kay-la). Every time she would bring a plate to Our table she would say \"this plate is very hot so be careful\" and then place it in front of my one year old daughter. When the bill came it was about $70 so my husband left $80 (four $20 bills). The service wasn't great (she kept trying to burn our daughter) so he left a 10% tip. He left the cash on the table and we walked out with our kids. As we are strapping the kids in their car seat a different server runs out and tells my husband we are short because there was only $60. Since it was late and the kids needed to get home he hands her another $20 bill. As he counts back his money in the car we realize and remember that there is no way that was only $60. He called the manager and asked him to check the cameras. He agrees and says he would call back in 30 minutes. In less than 30 minutes he calls back saying that the $20 was under a napkin on the table. There is no way that is True. When my husbands returns to pick up his $20 the manager makes the server apologize. The manager was useless. He didn't apologize for wasting our time and gas in returning to the restaurant. Nothing was offered for their mistake. Don't waste your time going to this restaurant. They will try to steal from you and there is absolutely nothing great enough to prefer this restaurant over any other in Las Vegas. Save yourself the trouble.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since it opened because I love to go out to eat.  I've been waiting though because based on Yelp reviews there seemed to be some kinks to work out.  I have to admit that I was still apprehensive since the reviews seem to be great or horrible.  No middle ground.  Boy am I upset that I waited.  I went for the first time on Wed 8/19.  The food was so good that I returned on Fri and Sun.  3 times in one week.  I know I have a problem, but the food is unbelievable. I am yet to have something that I didn't like.  Go during happy hour (4-6) for half off apps.  So far for Apps I've had stuffed mushrooms, Six-Cheese Artichoke Dip, street tacos, calamari, and Philly Cheesesteak Egg Rolls.  Each one was fantastic.  Only problem is that the cheese dip never comes with enough bread.  It should come with double.  Every time we need to ask for more.  For entrees I've had beer can chicken, bacon wrapped filet, and prime rib.  Again every one was very good.  The best had to be the filet.  Every bit as good as Fleming's ( my now second favorite restaurant ) and it costs $20 less and you get a side dish.  As for sides I have tried the loaded baked potato which was very good and the mac n cheese which was kind of disappointing but my 4 year old liked it.  I also tried the baked potato soup which was very good and a dinner salad which was also very good.  The warm bacon dressing was phenomenal.  I also want to add that they have a very good children's menu.  I have 4 kids and they all enjoyed it.     I regards to other reviewers who said it was overpriced.  You must really be some cheap-asses.  This isn't Applebee's.  This is a nice steakhouse!  The prices are on par or better than Outback, but much better quality.  This is more Fleming's or Del Frisco''s quality at a much better price.      Now for the bad.  The service is mediocre at best and sometimes borders on horrible.  We have had 3 different servers and although all were friendly, none were good at service.  I could walk across the parking lot to IHOP and get service that is 10x's better.  I have to assume that most of their servers had never waited tables before.  Hopefully they improve.  It's impossible to get a soda or water refill without asking.  This is one of my biggest pet peeves.  Even after you ask, they often still forget or it's not a priority to them and you wait at least 5 minutes for a refill and you're stuck trying to eat your food while sucking on ice. The second time we were there we never got bread and I didn't realize until we were ready to leave.  I asked the server why we never got bread and her excuse was that there was never any baked.  Really?  We were there an hour and a half and I know other tables got bread.  She should of just told the truth and said she forgot.      The food definitely gets 5 stars and makes this my new favorite restaurant, but service is 2 stars at best.",

Happy hour is amazing! 4-6pm everyday, 3$ glasses of wine and 1/2 price apps... Yes! Gaming, full bar, delicious food, and GREAT service. Let's face it, service makes the restaurant. The philly cheese steak egg rolls are incredible, the Cajun ribeye is on point, the filet is like velvet, the beer selection is decent, the Rosemary bread is  super soft and fluffy and addicting. The mac n cheese gets 2 thumbs up and if you can make your way to dessert... Get EVERYTHING!!!! They also offer a rewards card, and about 2 weeks after I signed up I got a coupon in the mail for a free appetizer. I have gone here about 4x in the last month and have had a great experience and great service every time, from the bartenders, to the host, to the servers. I definitely recommend FireRock!",

They've definitely turned it around, because I still remembered that building as Stoney's North Forty and they wiped that from my memory tonight.  Our waitress was Georjett and her service was awesome. Our drinks never even got close to empty and she was overall fantastic. My husband was pleased to see his meal of choice on the menu, and I got the BBQ pork nachos. His food was amazing...after trying a bite of his steak and the corn I told him I wished I had order the country fried steak! My nachos were great, too. Georjett suggested extra cheese and made sure they were cheesy enough for me when she dropped them off. The pork was super tender and delicious and the pico was delicious.

He said same thing. I cut into the middle and it tasted fine. I'm assuming it was something in the seasoning. Whatever it was, it was cloying and I couldn't finish it.

Still, you would hope that they would swing by to let you know about how long the wait for food or service is. The menu is huge, which while it may seem like a plus it means a lot of the food is frozen or pre-prepared. I had some open faced beef sandwich. It was terrible and I could taste the freezer burn on it. And for being obviously frozen, it wasn't even hot! It was just warm. For about $15, this is a shame. I would never come here again, not even for drinks. There are plenty of other places to go where the quality is higher that are worthy of patronage. I think they do smoke their own ribs, but there is better barbecue out there.  Also a few months ago they had the fire department called on them because the grease trap in their smoker caught fire. To me, this indicates they don't care about cleaning their kitchen.",

No one was at the hostess desk and several employees walked by casting us glances that were anything but welcoming.  The place was basically empty at 8:30 pm, and for good reason.  Who knows how many other would be customers walked out without being seated?  When I called the restaurant number, the manager, Heather, explained that the hostess was cleaning the bathrooms.  So, the place has clean bathrooms, but no interest in seating customers.  ",

She never asked us how we wanted our steaks done nor did she ask us if we wanted a soup or salad. I had to ask her \"don't we get to choose between a few sides?\" And she was like \"oh, yeah!\"   Nevertheless, the food was great. The bread was especially my favorite... so soft and flavorful.   Cajun spiced steak - 5 stars!!!!  Mashed potatoes had absolutely no flavor, though.. I had to add butter salt & pepper when we got home.",

Bread was good as usual!  Definitely recommend it!  Downside was we never were offered nor received water-- just the wine we ordered.  Waited approximately 10minutes before asked whether we wanted a second glass of wine. We both said yes but only the hubby got the second glass. I really didn't need the second so I didn't make a stink. For dessert we ordered salted caramel cheesecake. It was good but we assumed it would be a regular cheesecake with salted caramel topping instead of caramel cheesecake with caramel drizzle. Overall-- just ok. We have come here several times in the past. Not sure if it was an off night.",

The problem is the food quality. My wife's burger was dry and the lettuce was a wilted mess. My son's steak was cooked correctly but there was a huge hunk of fat in the middle. My maple glazed pork was fine but everything had such a smoky taste, you'd think they were cooking over a forest fire. In summary: good service is important but if your food is sub-par, I will continue to take my business elsewhere.",

Another 25 minutes for salad to come out  and finally patty melt and spaghetti and meatballs took another half hour asked for manage lost appetite by then ate two bites said she would check ticket time never came back when I asked for the manager to come back to our table Heather came back very confrontational very defensive and said every time we come there there is a problem well unfortunately they are a very inconsistent restaurant that goes through help left and right then she said we were rude to her server by asking when she said you want one meatball or two when I said the menu clearly states meatballs and I would like meatballs I asked how I was rude to the server I never raise my voice I didn't use any profanity and she was obviously looking for a problem! And honestly to have the food server there when the manager was confronting us what again completely unprofessional and Adaline the server should not of been present while that conversation is even taking place... Poor leader ship and even more poor choices! This is the place that we frequent a couple times of week and honestly with all the competition in town it's a very poorly ran organization... Oh but it gets better she then threatened to call the police on us and I said I'm done the head chef came out we spoke to him my husband grew up in the restaurant business he was nice but it was way beyond repair by then!   said I've never heard a manager speak so unprofessionally and condescending as well as looking for a problem and solely creating a problem that wasn't there! Absolutely ridiculous I would avoid this place like the plague it is completely a hit or mess they are understaffed and professional and untrained the only good food serve the entire restaurant has is Linda who I saw there tonight when this was unfolding and asked her if we had ever been rude to her and she said absolutely not!!! They are overpriced for the quality of steaks that they give the service is always hit and miss they hire very unprofessional people especially their managers Emily was a joke before Heather took her place and obviously this one is no better they need to get professional people running this place they could not pay me or my husband to ever step foot in that place my money is good anywhere!!! Instead of resolving what could've been a very easy problem she escalated it and fueled the fire absolutely not a professional threatening to call the police on a customer!!! I am a huge yelp fan being that we eat out 2 to 3 times a day and it's not fast food that we go to with over 800 reviews at 3 1/2 star that should be a great indication anything with that many reviews should be higher especially the money they get for steaks there!!! if you look at people's remarks with quality consistency and service you will see we are spot on with our review!!!",

    "text": "Took hubby here for Father's day lunch. I called ahead to see if reservations were needed being it was a 'holiday', and was told if we were a party of 8 or more it was recommended. I asked if the restaurant was good at the moment with no wait, and she said yes, so we headed over there after church.   Got to restaurant and checked in with hostess, who politely asked if we had a reservation?!?!  LOL I said we didn't, and did not mention that I had just called and was told I didn't need one. Anyway, we could clearly see the restaurant was not full nor was anyone waiting but us for them to set up a table. She said they only had  tables available  and if that was okay. I said it was fine, as long as the food tasted the same! hehe, she said something about how people would mention how booths were empty but they say only tables are available. I did see that once we got seated, but I didn't question further. We were fine.   The menu is pretty nice with lots of choices. It's kind of hard to decide what to try. Hubby was craving a steak I know because he kept seeing the Outback commercials with the huge ribeye, but I know he doesn't quite care for Outback.  He ended up getting the Sunday special which offered 6oz ($12.95)  8oz ($14.95) and 12oz.($18.95) sirloin, with soup or salad, and one side. He ordered  the 12oz of course, with a house salad and side of broccoli. The plate it was served on was a little bit, but the steak itself was tasty. A little more done than he ordered since he asked for medium rare, I ordered the Reuben sandwich because if that is on the menu I will always try it, even though this is a steakhouse! I've had better Reubens. The meat was like deli meat warmed up, I was expecting something off of a brisket I guess. Although the taste was good, I will order something else next time. My daughter got a ceasar salad and tomato beef soup combo. the soup was really good! It was like a creamy tomato soup with tender bits of beef. We also ordered an appertizer  of 3 cheese artichoke dip, which was okay, check that off the list.   Didn't leave room for dessert. the homemade bread rolls were slightly sweet so that was enough. although the chocolate cake and ice cream looked really tempting!! next time, we will skip the appetizer so we may order dessert!",

    "text": "(Updating this review as the GM reached out to me, thanked me for my review and even came to our table on our next visit and thanked us in person.  This type of dedication to customer satisfaction is what make the difference between a business that lasts and one that does not.  For that alone, this place gets 5 stars! )  I've been to FireRock at least a dozen times for happy hour in the past few months and here are my views so far.  I love their Happy Hour menu.  The mini Philly Cheesesteaks in Spring Roll wrappers are my favorite, but anything I've ever ordered has been great.  The staff is always friendly and I have yet to have a bad service experience.  So why 3 stars?  Here is my reasoning..... 1) Inconsistent bartender ability.  I always order a Whiskey Sour and the wife always orders a Malibu and Pineapple.  This past Friday, they were both made to perfection, but this is rarely the case.  I've ordered drinks and have had them come back and taste entirely different on almost every occasion.  One Whiskey Sour will be weak and then the next one will be strong.  Most times both drinks will be served in different glasses.  It feels like a crap shoot on what you are going to get and that's a problem from a quality standpoint. 2) Short staff.  FireRock's Happy Hour is insanely popular in our area.  We went without a reservation and had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Problem is, there are plenty of open tables, just not the staff to handle the increased amount of patrons.  I know know finding reliable help can be tough in Vegas, but if you know Happy Hour is rocking, get the right staff in there.  It's insanely frustrating to wait 20-30 minutes for a table and walk past 6-7 empty tables on the way to sit down. I really like FireRock and I recommend it to everyone. I hope they fix the above issues for an even better experience",

Then, my boss asks for some water ... this guy instead of grabbing him a fresh one, grabs the water from the end of the table which was water for the extra person who was going to show up. As he's handing the water or drinks he's doing it right across from someone else instead of coming around. When he was serving our appetizer, he handed US the plate to put on the table. Same when he picked up the plates, like he wanted US to hand it to him! No bags for our take home goods, just two containers. We were in a line of business where we DO grade calls and make sure our customers are receiving the upmost positive experience, instead we got this guy. I would never go back.

We called and talked to the manager and she told us to bring it back. We explained that we really didn't want to go back out in the rain to bring the food back.  She said that they cant do anything once we take it home. We asked them to come pick it up and they said that they did not have anyone to pick it up.  I think it is  strange that we order dinner, spend 20 minutes driving to pick it up, they prepare a terrible meal and they expect us to bring it back and would not even offer a restaurant credit.  We will never go back here!! Terrible Food and even worse is their customer service, they could have easily fixed it and now they lost a customer for good.  Disappointing!",

Missing 3 orders of fries, missing all the different dipping sauces for the appetizers. The smothered chicken tasted like chemicals. The braised beef tips were hard. The broccoli was WAY over cooked. I called and talked to them and they said \"sorry\", we'll tell the chef. Huh? That's it? OK..... So the only saving grace was the Philly chz egg rolls, but there was only 4 of those. $140 waste of money. I will never go there or order food from there again. I suggest that everyone steer clear of this place!!",

We didn't have silverware on the table and the waitress came over to us 5 times prior to get drinks and our order. I told her we need silverware to eat and napkins to wipe our mouths. She started blaming the bus boy. Is she that blind not to notice?? OMG.... I should have stayed home and cooked my own breakfast. Why can't restaurants, cooks and waitresses take their job serious anymore?? I wasn't impressed with my meal and neither my family. Won't be going back there again??",

To the point where we had to remind him that we asked for water with the drinks, which took over 30 minutes to get.  Additionally, watching which I believe was the managers boyfriend or fling pay more attention to him then pay attention to their customers.  So about an hour into waiting we finally got our appetizers! Luckily we had good conversation, which replaced the horrible service we got.

Our waitress was fantastic and fixed everything and even gave us a giftcard to come back.  Our second time coming here will be our last. The wait time they told us was actually doubled. Also when we did get seated it took another 15 minutes to even see our waitress. By the time she did come I once again let them know about my allergy. When the salad came out it was covered in cheese. They also brought out bread with melted butter on top and put it  right in front of me without saying anything. They should have let me know I couldn't eat it in case I didn't realize their was butter on it. When our entrees came out they were overcooked. Also once we ordered we never saw our waitress until 1hr later when we had to flag her down for the check.  We definitely won't be back.",

Never a good sign. 9:30 we got our order. The one who served our food clearly not well organized. She made excuses ranging from being super busy to things upside down in the kitchen for delivering our food late. No call back offers for more water. My son had 3 empty soda glasses in front of him at the end. Slow to clear plates. No bread to the table. Had to ask the manager for some when he stopped by the table. Now for the topper! Given to wrong bill and paid it. Server comes after us in the parking lot. Go back in and payed the right one. I don't think we'll be back. Three stars.....and I feel I'm being generous.",

    "text": "When the Roadrunner off of Centennial Parkway and Tropical closed it was a hope that they would replace the dive bar with something new and exciting to try, but rarely do we find that occurs in Las Vegas.  Thankfully, that very thing happened for once. The new FireRock has opened and to say the least, it is a breath of fresh air in a very stale corner of the city.  We sat at the bar and were very pleased to see an extensive wine, cocktail and beer list, including many signature cocktails and great tap beers.   The menu is based on American steakhouse fare and includes a very unique chop salad with a southwestern twist, including a garlic chipotle dressing, roasted hearts of romaine, avocado and corn. I had the jalapeno smash burger with their house-made chips.  The burger is chopped sirloin and is fantastic, as are the chips and house-made fresh salsa they serve on the side. My wife had the caprese salad and found it average in quality. We also decided to try the unique Philly Steak Eggrolls and were blown away. They are unreal in whimsy, flavor and portion. They come with an A-1 aioli that is amazing. Ask for the liquid cheese to dip with as well and dip in both sauces for an AMAZING taste explosion!    Happy hour at the bar is daily from 4-6pm and late night from 10pm-close.  It includes half-price appetizers and Oysters Rockefeller at $2 per oyster.  The service at the bar was a bit iffy but friendly. They were very busy when we were in so another chance for the service will happily be provided.   If you are looking for a fun new spot in the Northwest Valley give this spot a try. It is well worth it to give them a shot.",

As soon as we sat down, I saw some of the waitresses chatting with the hostess and they didn't look pleasant to either serve us or be there in general so I took one star away for that; this is your job, if you'd rather be somewhere else, please leave.  Took a LONG while yet again for our waitress to come and take our orders.  Here's where I took out some stars...the mussels appetizer was VERY DELICIOUS and the bread is so ridiculously awesome in itself, BUT the monte cristo sandwich was mediocre and we've had better at Cheesecake Factory; the prime rib sandwich tasted old (frozen, not fresh).  The country fried steak however, was pretty good though.  Thanks just the same but I do not think we will be returning.",

The service was on point obviously because there servers were walking around scared instead of happy. The food was mediocre, I'm more disgusted with the management and ways they spoke about my awesome server kalie. If you want a good steak I would save your time and money.

My family and I got put in a private room because they were too full to sit us anywhere else, which was fine. We ordered our food, and the server forgot 2 of our meals and served us a dish (which was a sandwich) and the bread had mold on it. She began to tell is it was just avocado, I told her to take a closer look and she said she will send it back. We reminded her of the other meals she hadn't brought out ( we had been waiting for 30 minutes for these other meals ) the manager then brought out the sandwich with new bread, but then forgot the French fries that came with the meal. The manager said \" we make our bread fresh everyday there is no reason why mold should be on the bread, I apologize\". Management is obviously lying because mold DOESNT grow on bread within a day. & being a manager, the best he could do was remove that meal. Considering FireRock is a nice restaurant I'm really disappointed. The manager was cocky and to prideful to even listen to our concerns, he didn't care about anyone but himself. He was starting confrontation with us when we were explaining about the other meals that were forgotten. Never coming here again, such a bullshit experience. Make sure you check your food before you eat it. :)",

Was cooked ok til I got to the T bone part and it was bloody. Appetizers were really good. Everybody else at the table was satisfied with their food.  Second Time Service.....Much better, the waitress was on the drinks like a champion and the empty plates were cleared quickly.   Food got a rib eye this time and it was much much better.

I order a 6oz Top Sirloin cooked medium rare with a side of white cheddar mash potatoes. My husband ordered the guacamole bacon burger with onion rings. After ordering we were served rolls which were delicious. However, upon receiving our meals we were very disappointed. My steak was cooked well done with absolutely no flavor, quite frankly it was one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Next, I anxiously tried my white cheddar mash potatoes only to discover that there was no cheddar cheese in them or any flavor. My husbands burger was cooked okay but once again lacked any flavor. His onion rings were a bit soggy like they'd been sitting for awhile. Overall I'm very sad. I was so excited to have a date night out and enjoy a flavorful steak. I will not be returning.",

Our server, Sammy, was incredibly helpful with drink suggestions and menu selections.  You could tell he actually cared about providing quality customer service.    Now to the rest.  The appetizers we had, calamari and seared ahi tuna were delicious.  Our main meals of Filet Oscar and NY Strip were well prepared and presented.  The steaks were perfectly cooked to medium with a seared crisp outer and a juicy tender center.    We will definitely be returning, and bringing our friends along!",

    "text": "I understand this restaurant opened last Sunday; just wish they got a few of the kinks worked out before they opened for business. I'd be willing to try this place ONE more time and update my review, but Here's how it went for us on our first visit Saturday night.  We called @ 5:20 to see if we needed reservations for a table. We explained we were about 10 minutes away. The person who answered the phone said no, and to come on down because they could seat us right away. We arrived at 5:30 and the hostess said there was a 20 minute wait. She said we could sit in the bar area. Not what we wanted but we were hungry and had plans later. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. We've waited a long time for a place like this out here in the Centennial area! We ordered a beer and a glass of wine. I ordered a glass of one of my favorite whites, but our server said they were out of it.  Open for 6 days and you're out? That's interesting. Since we were seated in the bar area, we saw a bar tender pour the beer (Guinness is hard to miss) and my alternate wine, and watched it sit for 15 minutes before our server picked it up. In that 15 minutes, she did come and tell us she was checking on our drinks and that she was still waiting for the bar tender to pour my wine. There were 4-5 bar tenders last night so I'm unsure of the hold up. Our waitress was friendly but seemed like she was working double time. In fact, all the servers in the bar area that we could see were working hard but had more of the \"chicken with its head cut off\" thing going.  Drinks finally came and apps were out shortly after. We had tacos and lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps were good. Tacos were fair. For dinner, I got beer can chicken and a dinner salad. My honey got a T-bone steak with lobster tail, and French onion soup. It took longer than I would expect, but my dinner salad finally arrived. The soup, however, was nowhere in sight. Neither was our waitress for that matter. I finished my salad, he finished his beer and NADA. Our waitress finally came back. She said she was checking on our food and \"it would be right up\". She asked if we wanted another beer. We said yes, but since our food was going to come quickly, we asked her to cancel the soup. She apologized and said she would take care of it. She also said fresh bread would be out shortly.   5 minutes later....no bread, no beer, and no dinner. 10 minutes later, still nothing. But then a beer came with the promise our food would be right out. It had been another 10 minutes and we started to see a manager passing by some tables to chat. It started to dawn on us we might not be the only table having issues.  With that, our waitress finally returned to tell us (please sit for this one!!!) \"THE KITCHEN HAS LOST YOUR FOOD!!!!\" Omg  where do I start?!?! I said \"how is that even possible?\". She told me that if 2 servers are entering an order at the same time on the computers, one order will get kicked out of the system and that no one knows where it goes. Holy moly. As if that isn't bad enough, our waitress went on to tell us what a disaster they had in a previous night. Apparently, the printers in the kitchen ran out of paper. For 15 minutes no orders were getting printed and she estimated that at at least 40 tables. Wow.   Anyway.....Our server was insistent we get that French onion soup after all, even though we were still telling her we didn't want it. A manager (I believe his name was Donnie) brought the soup a few minutes later and asked us how our night was. I said \"we heard you guys lost our food\". His response was a noticeably curt \"yeah, we might have!!!\", and left our table immediately.  We were dumb founded. I'm kinda  still annoyed by his snarky response.  We ate a few spoon fools of soup....then our dinner finally came! It was 7:10 pm at this point; more than an hour and a half after arriving. My dinner came correctly, but the steak and lobster tail meal was short one lobster tail. Sadly, not a shocker at this point. Our server didn't bring the food, but came by about 8 minutes later. We told her about the lobster and she said she'd check on it. We told her not to bother at this point. she came back and said the chef says he only needs 1 and a half minutes for it. It came out 15 minutes later.  Another manager came to our table (thank goodness not the soup guy!) and their offer to make this right was to comp us drinks, and the 2 late items...lobster tail and soup. We told them that wouldn't get us back in the door. He then came back with a $50 gift card for a future visit. We understand being new and a certain amount of \"growing pains\", but some of this was over the top (not in the good way). If we had this experience at an established restaurant, we would not return. However, we would consider a second chance here...good menu and prices...but not for a little while.  Hopefully they get things together soon. Come on FireRock!",

Myself and guests show up and the location is CLOSED. I call from the parking lot as 20 people are waiting in the parking lot some traveled from Utah some from El Paso Tx.  The \"Manager\" said sorry we had a kitchen fire today. I  am very sympathetic to issues out of your control... You have had our reservation for some time is it asking to much for you to have called before all 20 people showed up... Or perhaps early enough for us to find another location to accommodate 20 people.  She said they were to busy to think about little things like that.  Shame on you.",

She was super knowledgeable about what to order and especially on the wine pairings. She even went out of her way to introduce us to her manager Donny who was walking by. He made sure we were being taken of.  We will go back for sure....great place, great location and Great service!!!",

We got in and were greeted with friendly faces and seated right away. Everything seemed OK until we sat at our table. We quickly noticed that it was raining inside as well!! Their ceiling is leaking in several spots. Then the flies. It was so annoying trying to read the menu or try some appetizers with flies buzzing your face and ears.   We tried the Philly cheese steak egg rolls... Fail. They were so bland and reminded me of something from the \"great value\" line of food products from Walmart; definitely took me back to my college days where you ate the cheapest food you can find. Ordered my daughter (19months) the broccoli and cheese.. Gerber Little Chefs makes a tastier version of this simple dish broccoli and cheese. Fire Rock version tasted like steamed unseasoned broccoli with the cheese sauce being a mixture of Kraft mac and cheese powder pack with water.. Horrible. The only palatable item ordered, was my glass of Pepsi.   I gave the place 2 stars cause they have some good potential. Seems like they need an overhaul with their \"Chef\" and kitchen crew. I myself have over 16 years of culinary experience and this seems like the type of place where the \"chef\" is somebody's husband, family member, or close friend who is only there for that specific reason. Hopefully we can return after a few months when they realize they need to make that change in the kitchen.. Start from the top and work your way down.   If you think I'm being too \"dramatic\"... Look at the photos other people have posted, or go see for yourself. Sloppy and amateur.",

    "text": "FireRock was recommended to me by a friend for drinks & appetizers at the bar but we decided to try for dinner on a Friday night.  We waited too long to be acknowledged after we were seated but Luis who was working another section swooped in and took over since the server that was evidently assigned to our table couldn't get to us.  I would give 5 stars for his service and the tip left reflected his service NOT the food which was horrible with the exception of the Fire Cracker Shrimp appetizer- it was delish.  I expected much more from the main courses since this is supposed to be a steak house and we came for dinner not just drinks and appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the French Cut Pork Chop.  It was just OK; overcooked, dry and lacking flavor but edible.  It was served with mashed potatoes that were not only stone cold but obviously made from potato flakes from a box NOT real potatoes (you know the taste).  Luckily he ordered a baked potato as well and it was good.  I ordered the pork medallions and they were hard and dry, NOT edible.  I would bet the dinner check that they were out of a box as well and heated in a microwave or toaster oven.  My dish also came with the boxed mashed and the vegetable also seemed less than fresh so I skipped the whole plate after 1 bite of each.   Luckily my boyfriend shared his baked potato with me.  Luis asked if I wanted a to go box and when I said \"no, that's OK\" he immediately caught my drift and said \"enough said, I understand\".  He credited my meal from our check and he was, of course, tipped 20% + on the cost of what the entire meal would have been.  We certainly appreciated his service. I understood we weren't at TBones and I feel my expectations were in line however this establishment should review the pork selections and not offer them if this is the best they can do. With so many great choices in Vegas, I will definitely skip a repeat as this one.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying I am 24 weeks pregnant and I cannot eat just anywhere because of my pickyness with food, and also my husband is a personal trainer which means he eats A LOT and is picky as well. With that said, we have been going to FireRock Steakhouse for about 3 years, and we eat here about 3-4 times a year with family/friends/ourselves and we LOVE IT! Our average bill for just the two of us is about $45-$50 without tip. To us that is a fair price if you're looking for a nice place close by (northwest area ) for a relaxing time away from home with good food and good portions. In these 3 years we have been going we never encountered a poor service or bad food that has ruined our experience with FireRock. Our servers have always been great and nice and so has the managers always making us feel welcome and like they care about our dinning experience. I have never been to ANY restaurant that has had too many staff or an over flow of staff, and I would say FireRock has a sufficient amount of staff for the clientele they have (at least the times we have gone). We really love this place that we even got engaged here  and that night will be something I will not forget. They helped made it unforgettable. Tonight our server was Sara, she was great and always had a smiling face and she was kind. She made sure we were good throughout our dinner. For appetizers we had their bread(love) and the Philly cheese steak egg rolls(looovvvveee),I had the Philly cheese steak sandwich ,for the first time,which I liked and my husband tried for the second time the fish tacos which I really enjoyed(I took one of them to try!). By the end we were both so full we had no room for desert, since like I said portions are big. Can't wait till next time!!",

After being seated, our server took our drink order then disappeared. It took about 20  min to get our drinks! Dude dropped the drinks and bolted without taking our order. It was another 10 min before he came back. Several drinks were wrong so we asked for that to be corrected. He took our order and said he'd bring correct drinks. Those drinks never showed! Our food arrived but a few orders were wrong and all were not hot. We asked to see a manager. Trista arrives at our table all happy and apologizing. She says she'll make things right and starts putting her hands on my husband. She keeps looking at him, putting her hands on his shoulder and arm while she talks. She offers him a gift card to help with all the problems. We tell her we don't want a gift card but the drinks and food we ordered. She tells my husband she'll have the server bring a gift card when he brings our bill and she giggles her way out of the conversation.  This was seriously the worst experience we have had - EVER! This manager needs to keep her hands to her self!",

Our food arrived fairly quickly; however the smothered chicken tasted like some weird chemicals or something.  The 3 appetizers we ordered had zero dipping sauces and we didn't get half of our order. My sons burger was raw too.  All around bad food.  We called the restaurant and the guy that answered the phone didn't seem to care at all.  His response was, \"I will talk to the chef\" not I'm sorry. Nor did he try to offer the food we didn't receive which we paid for.   Needless to say; we will not be going back here.",

I don't want to be a snob so we sat down and look at the bar menu of drinks. 4-5 servers walk by and the bar tender looks at us and nobody said anything to us. There are plenty of servers standing and talking and nothing. So after making eye contact with everyone who will look at me and getting no response. We leave and go eat at BJs which was a great experience. NEVER COMING BACK.",

FireRock is an actual modern decor restaurant with modern TV's (sorry Bob Taylor)  It's nice to get away from the smokers (like @Kopper, Shucks, and even Wahoo)  It's nice to have quality food options (not like Shucks or BWW)  It's nice to have a full bar (w/rum or tequila for example) with lots of TV's (sorry Mimi's)  It's nice to have reasonable low-carb menu options (sorry Wahoo, Red Robin, & Michiocan).   Oh, and there's a 7-day 3pm to 6pm happy menu and it's better food than BJ's.  Pros: No smokers No cancer causing 2nd hand smoke Ability to play Video Poker w/o waking up smelling like an ashtray Happy hour menu everyday 3p to 6p  Cons: Service is slow, like BWW  So far, so good",

Their team did an outstanding job of making our event a tremendous success. Our two servers, Janet and Onyi provided excellent service,the food was fantastic and we could not have been more pleased.  This was a first time visit for many of our members of our members however they were so pleased with the experience they plan to host their group events at Firerock in the future, they truly loved it. Their General manager, Linda, was very helpful in the planning process and checked in on our group throughout the night to make sure everything went well.  Great hospitality!  Thanks again to the crew at Firerock!",

    "text": "We recently moved to Centennial Hills and we were urged by friends to try FireRock Steakhouse. Finally got the opportunity on Sunday evening to have dinner there. We were seated as soon as we walked in which was great. Our server was Linda who promptly took our drink order and gave us a chance to peruse the menu since this was our first visit here. I decided on the shrimp scampi with basmati rice and my companion chose the rib eye with mashed potatoes. Our salads were average, nothing special but mine looked as though the last bit of croutons were used for my plate. Nothing but dust bits on my salad!! We finally received our bread which was yummy and delicious! We actually ate the whole thing while waiting for the entrees to make their way to out table. I was a bit disappointed with my shrimp scampi! Although the shrimp were cooked properly, the sauce they were sitting in was overly salty!! The basmati rice tasted like it came from a box and it too was overly salty. I was hoping for a fresher tasting meal but it wasn't to be.   Well my friends who recommended FireRock were so saddened by my review that they chose to treat us to another meal there. We came on a Saturday evening, but after a short wait, we were seated promptly. It was then it went downhill from there. Our server was Amanda and she greeted us warmly and took our drink order. Shortly after our drinks arrived she took our dinner order and we sat and chatted for a bit. Then the long wait began!! We were patient, knowing it was a Saturday evening and the restaurant was busy. The wait dragged on and on and Amanda was nowhere in sight. After an hour we were getting annoyed since our meal order wasn't showing up and we had given enough time to bring the 4 sandwiches we ordered. At last, after inquiring about our order, it was delivered to our table. So very disappointed with the quality of the food. Everything was dried up as though they had left it sitting in the window forever!! My pulled pork was dry and totally inedible!! Really?? How many chances do you need to put out a decent meal?? I'm giving up!! If your servers don't care, why should I??",

Our server was not about checking up on us to refill drinks while waiting on our food; needless to say it took about 40min for our food to arrive. Once it arrived it was served a mere warmth as if it was sitting for a good 15min till it was brought out. So we were very disappointed as well as one of the orders was not what we ordered. Our server just said we can remake the order that you originally ordered but you would have to wait about 25min. I asked for the bill and paid and left. The service was horrible and not even a manager came to see if we were ok and see if there was any possible solution on the order being wrong. Wish I could've had a pleasant experience, especially it being our anniversary.",

Moist and mostly lean Short Rib Ragout finished with a savory Veal & Wine Gravy was nicely tossed with fettuccine.  Smothered Chicken showing glimpses of ham and melted Provolone through a covering of White Wine Cream Sauce was somewhat unique and inviting.  Prices were reasonable, and service friendly and efficient.  Ambiance was fireside Western.  The only drawback noted was the place was packed, and the high level of noise from the expansive bar near the restaurant entrance carried into the dining room deeper inside.",

My favorite cut of meat. They brought me a strip steak. I asked my waiter for the ribeye I ordered. He said it was. So then I had to wait for the manager. She reduced the price to what I was actually brought instead of what I ordered and brought the kids a giant cake and ice cream.   The food was good and the service was good.

The ambiance is nice, cloth napkin and tablecloths, nice decor... doesn't really feel like you are at an average gaming bar/restaurant.   Location is great, Centennial is full of chain restaurants so it's refreshing that this isn't another Darden property.   Pork bbq nachos are good... they use sweet baby rays bbq sauce. It's the bomb.   Beef dip sandwich was also good along with fries.   Also notable Wedge salad Potato soup  Ribs Shrimp dinner  Everything that was ordered in our party was delicious. Will definitely be back.   Ps they have a great happy hour, 3pm-6 pm and 10pm-6am",

They are seasoned and steaming hot and still in the round pan when they get to the table.  The happy hour menu is pretty good but it doesn't seem like they change the items out and offer new things which would be great.  My fav happy hour snack is the lettuce wraps.   I decided to order off the regular menu and get steak kabobs.  It was good but not great.  For a steakhouse I was thinking the meat would be more tender (ordered medium rare). Flavor was good though. The atmosphere is very nice and if you eat in the restaurant area they do have linen table cloths for an upscale look.  There is a private dining area as well for smaller parties that is very nice. I've been here for breakfast as well and did enjoy the french toast.",

Overall everything we ordered was good but their house bread was the most unforgettable thing of our dinner. The bread is warm, soft and has a garlic flavor. It was so good we had 3 servings (1 1/2 we took home). The Ahi tuna appetizer was very good. My husband and I both ordered steaks (ribeye for him and the 8 oz top sirloin for me) with baked potatoes on the side. The steaks were not over the top great but we liked it enough that we finished most of it (I ate up all my 8 oz lol!) The Ceasar salad (included with my dinner as my choice from soup/salad) was on the dry side, it needed a little more dressing. The restaurant reminded us of a fancier BJ's Restaurant where the ambiance is casual with a big bar area with sports tv and a touch of formal dining throughout. Overall we liked FireRock and plan to go back, if not only for their bread!",

We weren't even offered a wine menu and once we were, we were not given any time before asking for our meal order which was taken while one person was in the restroom.  Overall just not the best service experience I would expect from a mid grade \"local\" steak restaurant.

    "text": "Don't go between 5-8pm. Apparently, the kitchen doesn't know how to manage a lot of orders. Food is very good but the service is extremely, extremely slow. We went last week and after waiting for about 15 minutes to be seated (even when we were the only customers waiting) It took 1 hour and 10 mins to get our food (yeap, I counted), and once it arrived, it was cold, I mean dead cold. My 9-yr old was really disappointed since she was starving.Told the waiter and she took it back....another 20 minutes wait.This is the 2nd time we have a similar experience. You could say the waiter was embarrassed. We used to enjoy this place, we had visited maybe 10 times? but the last 2 times has been a disaster. Their service has go downhill fast. Overall is has a good atmosphere and food but, I am not sure if we are coming back. The wait time for the food is ridiculous. They definitely need to work something out to solve this issue and I know I'm not the only one who has experience this. I hope the manager/owners listen to what customers are saying because in a competitive city like Las Vegas with so many options....if you don't excel, you will be out of business soon.",

I ordered prime rib, pretty hard to completely bomb this meal, but they so.e how managed. It was tough, dry and very over salted. The girlfriend I went to dinner with would just eat a saltl lick if she could get away with such a thing even said it was crazily over salted before I passed judgment.  The month before the meal had been great but they could not get b out the dinners even nearly together, it was a group  of five and one would get a meal and be about finished before the other would get their plate jot to mention the three appetizers we never got.",

How much work is it to go from breakfast to lunch? Also wouldn't you start that process at 10:40 to be able to serve lunch at 11 when most people go to lunch? Seems strange for a restaurant that is open 24 hours a day.  Also I ordered the ribeye, medium, and it was extremely salty and dry. I never use sauce on my steak but I had to and I couldn't even finish it. I very disappointed. On the plus side the decode looks descent so it gets one star at least.",

Even bringing him a Cheesecake for dessert (which was delicious) and taking a photo of the 3 of us! My Dad wanted a T bone steak and he ended up with the Cowboy Cut!!! This thing was HUGE! The 3 of us could easily have shared it! My husband had the Pork chop and I had the Pork medallions! All were great but, I think mine was the best! Oh I also upgraded my salad to the green apple, Swiss cheese and walnut salad with a side of Vanilla dressing... may have been the weirdest salad ever almost like Cole slaw but with apples and no lettuce! It may have been the best salad I have ever eaten! Next time I may just have that and the hot bread that they serve... like everything else the bread was great!! Dinner for the 3 of us including drinks was $121 and we brought home tons of leftovers!!!! All of the staff was very pleasant but, again I'd suggest asking for Stephanie especially if you need help picking what you want to eat! Can't wait to come back and we will definitely be bringing our out of town guests here! Again, thanks for everything!!!",

She helps navigate my soy allergy issue (as did the manager last time over the phone).  We actually have been here so many times and can't say I've ever really had a bad experience.  Food was excellent, even on a Friday night when sometimes quality goes down at restaurants because it's so busy.  We had an emergency situation happen when my sis in law fell or tripped, hit her head and started seizuring.  She was not conscious.  Staff called 911 and the blonde lady (didn't get her name) stayed on floor holding her hand, monitoring her til help came.  The professionalism and compassion shown by the staff was exemplary!  We stayed and ate, then went to hospital.  Andrea is so good with people, down to earth, and really attentive. I have never felt so good about highly recommending a restaurant like I do Firerock.

I was told that only a 12oz NY and a 10oz sirloin I believe were left. I ended up ordering the chicken fried steak which was okay. I was a little put out about them being practically out of steak. A steakhouse that has no steaks, inexcusable.   So when I was done it took me a bit to get the bartenders attention letting him know I was ready for the check. He acknowledged me and then spent some time with four women on the other side of the bar ignoring me. After a bit I asked the hostess if she could check me out. She seemed embarrassed and was the only employee who appeared to know what customer service was. She was able to help me and was apologetic.   I pray that the hostess gets a job elsewhere, She could do much better and feel good about where she works somewhere else.

I was happy with it.  main course was a filet cooked medium rare with baked potato and a chicken cobb salad. meal came fairly quick and presentation was good. the filet had a great smokey and salty taste to it, most likely from the bacon wrapped around it I think it was. the only issue I had was with the chicken cobb salad was incorrectly made. not sure what I was served, but I sent it back and got the correct salad and was very happy with it. server took care of the issue with the salad and took care of us throughout our first trip there.  10/10 in my book, we will be coming back again. food was excellent, service was on point, dining experience was great. no complaints here.",

I ordered a filet and loaded baked potato. My husband ordered a filet and the au grautin potatoes.  When they brought out our food my steak was not cooked the way I had asked and my husbands potatoes were cold.  They didn't bring my baked potato out with my steak because it was still cooking.  We sent my steak back and my husbands potatoes and then they brought that out with my baked potato and the baked potato was not cooked all the way.  I couldn't even put my fork through it. So disappointed.",

Grilled Caesars salad sounded good but was so drenched in dressing it was mush. Country  fried steak  was large but sat in a mushy flood of gravy. Lacked flavor.  Mixed veggies was fair. They do give you lots of  hot rolls. They had little flavor.  Our waitress was very nice but mixed up a lot of our order. She always fixed the mix ups. Very slow service, lots of time between salads and the main course.  Bartender was not friendly. Didn't seem like many of the employees were happy. I will not go back.",

We had to ask another server if we were able to get bread. I won't be returning. She even walked past us a couple times to check up on the table next to us, but never stopped at our table. Service experience failure. The most disappointing part was we went for my friends birthday, and tried to surprise him with a little birthday dessert as most restaurants do. Even after writing happy bday all over the table and telling the waitress happy bday, no one even said happy birthday or thanks for dining with us on your birthday. Not one gesture to go above and beyond. Just order.. Here's your food.. Have a good day..",

Still no bread...Finally the guy who delivered our food took our empty plates and brought us some bread. Took forever for the check too. It was a Tuesday evening not a weekend.

Both times there were issues with getting my order right and getting good prompt customer service. I think once they get a handle on that they will be a much better establishment. I've had soup twice, salads both times, a burger, and the calamari. The food isn't fabulous. It's good but not fabulous.   So 3 stars for now, 4 stars if you get the service up to par, and 5 stars if you get the food a little better. Ultimately it is like a high end chain restaurant. Give it a chance.

The older gentleman kept getting up and walking to the bar to play the slot machines, and have a drink he just left his little dog to wander around. Finally when we said something he grabbed the dog by the leash and kept it by him. When he got up, he had urinated all over himself, and the bar stool. He walked back to the first booth and sat back down. We informed the waitress and told her that the stool, even though vinyl had been urinated on as well as the booth seat. The man, finally left. We were there for at least another hour and no one even attempted to clean either the bar stool or the booth! Makes you wonder what else you could be sitting on in there, flys everywhere. Won't be going there again, makes you wonder about there sanitation practices!",

We didn't get food until 8:40pm.  2. All red meat items except the filet mignon were extremely over-cooked and dry.  3. The side dishes that went with the meat were cold. Some of the veggies were raw and cold while others were cooked.  4. The bacon wrapped filet had a stick in it still.  5. We waited 15-20 minutes for drinks each time we ordered one.  6. Two of the people dining with us got sick after eating.  7.  Only one entree was cooked correctly. Everyone that ordered medium, received well done (dry and tasteless). The people that ordered well done, received a bloody piece of meat. 8. Our waitress was spread throughout the restaurant, while other servers only had 1-2 tables.   They discounted our bill, but really we should not have been charged. We had out of town guests that we brought and it was embarrassing that the restaurant that we recommended screwed up so badly-- on a special occasion!! The manager tried to explain that there were new cooks and changes that had recently been made-- as if the logistics of the restaurant are a factor to the guests. Beware of this place. Clearly their recent changes are for the worse!",

We ordered oysters the ice melted all over the table. No one checked on us we had to find them to get something and to tell them about the ice.

She would visit your table and make you feel like a VIP.  Her knowledge of wine helped me venture out into the wine world.  Not sure where she's been but you definitely need her back.

I think firerock needs to train their bartenders on customer service, learn how to circle the bar. There are two of you, why are you both at the same end of the bar?.

    "text": "Took a family friend there to try it for the first time it was ok.. There was issues with seating us as the host were chatting among them selves trying to figure out where to go . Then servers came up and said no go here or here so it just became awkward. We weren't given a drink menu so we had to ask for one, it's interesting to have them on an iPad .. They need to update them though because they had drafts beers listed that they didn't carry, kinda a bummer. The server was nice , guided us through the menu.. We started out with crab cake and firecracker shrimp , the shrimp was pretty Good but the crab cake was nothing that we expected . It was small and for 9$ you only get one , it wasn't that good. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and biscuits it was way way way too much Rosemary .. It just tasted like a giant Rosemary in your mouth, he couldn't really eat it. My friend got the smothered chicken and rice it was alright he said the ham tasted like processed ham and was too salty. I got the bacon wrapped filet , the steak was delicious that's the one thing we could all agree on. We were here for  a little over two hours and we definitely did not want to be , the appetizers took about 15 mins which is standard , but then after we ate them our salads didn't come for over 20 mins.. That was a little irritating .. Right when the salads came not even 30 seconds later our food came .. The server never did a two bite check which probably would have helped with my boyfriends Rosemary dish . Also I could see the GM introducing herself to tables around and saying thank you for coming .. She never came to our table , I feel like because we look young or what not she didn't feel the need to stop at our table. I'm in the industry I know how manager table touches work and I didn't feel like we were acknowledged at all . We're debating on going back, we might give it one more chance but I doubt it .",

    "text": "So I just had my first experience at FireRock and it was extremely disappointing. I was very excited that there was a new restaurant in the area but it did not live up to the hype. So I work in the service industry and I work on the strip. So I'm used to crappy people and busy days. But for a Saturday at 2 pm there was nothing busy about FireRock. When we were sat ( a table of 3) we weren't greeted for 5 minutes to be told she will be a minute. Then casually waited another 10 minutes just to get our drink order but by that time we were ready to order food. I asked a few questions about the menu and she didn't know how any of it tasted. She also brought out a thing of bread instead of beverages first. We asked for both water and ordered alcohol. But what I did ordered (cioppino) was terrible. It was described in a spicy red sauce which was really tomato sauce with huge whole tomatoes in it. It also had 3 mussels, 2, shrimp, and 1 scallop. Not to mention the worlds Smallest king crab leg sticking out the bowl for decoration. It was miserable. My boyfriends ribeye was overly fatty but well cooked and seasoned. That's the only reason they are getting two stars. His sweet potato fries were over cooked and dry. Our server rarely checked on us and was two busy talking to another table of women her age and just gabbing it up. I'm glad someone got good service from her cause we surely didn't. But after I put my plate aside and it was barely eaten. She asked if it was a good recommendation. I Said no and gave her this exact reasoning and she still continued to do nothing. So we took the bill and left. I will never come back to FireRock ever again. I spent $70 on the worst lunch date. Untrained staff. And overpriced food that doesn't even taste good.",

    "text": "So we gave this place a few weeks to get open get through the new restaurant opening jitters. Probably shouldn't have gone here on our anniversary but we thought it was a new steakhouse how could we go wrong. Number one it was happy hour on a Sunday night at 5:30 so it took us 30 minutes to get seated and a place was extremely noisy. They offer good deals on their appetizers but the appetizers we tried really weren't that great. We tried the crab cakes which were half price probably weren't worth 2 bucks. They came lukewarm and I thought someone undercooked. The sauce that drizzled on them was pretty much tasteless. My wife ordered the prime rib and I ordered the Cajun ribeye. She orders the side of asparagus and I ordered a side baked potato loaded. Asparagus she asked for grilled instead of staying it was probably the only decent item on the table. Prime rib was bland and the horseradish they brought to go with it was crap. My ribeye if it if it didn't have salt on it would have had no taste at all. Didn't taste like there was any Cajun seasoning on it all. Wait what we wanted but the rest in a to go box for the dogs. So sad that we wasted our anniversary on this place. I don't care if it's happy hour or not you take care of your customers tired of hearing the excuse . Hope this is helpful to you all you're looking for a good steak dinner. I wish we had gone to Bob Taylor's ranch house instead.",

We hadn't been to a steakhouse in a while, so we decided to give it a try last night.  My first impression was....\"wow, this place is much bigger on the inside than on the outside!\".   We were greeted promplty and taken to a booth by a hostess.  Our waiter was adorable.... his name was Daryl.  I remember his name because he wrote it on our tablecloth with a crayon.   The menu was pretty extensive, and the prices seemed reasonable.   Daryl brought us some bread, and it was delicious. Hubby ordered a ribeye, daughter had a chicken cobb salad, and I had steak medalions served in a mushroom gravy on top of mashed potatoes.  Everything was wonderful!  Cooked to perfection  and very flavorful.  Portions were fair.... although my daughter's salad was enormous.  Her biggest complaint was that everything was piled on so high it was impossible to \"mix\" the salad without everything falling off of the plate.   We really enjoyed the food, and the service was really good, too!  We will definitily be back.",

Only asked for it to be medium cooked. Literally all I could taste was the char so I asked for some sauce to make it bearable. We didn't even get any bread upon arrival. My partner said he would rate his chicken at a 3.  2 hours after leaving my bank calls me and informed me of a fraud charge from out of state, I called the manager of the restaurant to inform them (not accusing anything just stating the facts) and her attitude about it was very lackadaisical, she didn't care. I will not be returning nor recommending this location. Steer clear.",

    "text": "First, thank you for taking a risk at this building that seemed to lack stability. I can't even recall how many have come and go at this location. This review is a combination of 3 visits. So, I've had a \"taste\" of staff and various menu items.  The staff is friendly and willing so no negative feedback in this area.  I want to talk about the food.  I did find the history of this company before it opened and didn't pay attention to the menu much until I came in person. All I can say is holy cow. It's too big. We don't have time to be this confused.  Okay, the food ..... Appetizer  Seared Ahi Tuna. Fresh tuna not slimy at all, crispy greens, great sauce that wasn't too salty and full of asian flavor but it was swimming in too much sauce, it was soup at the end. I would order this again. Beet salad with honey and pistachios - crispy and sticky, full of flavor and i will order this again also.  My husband had the NY strip steak, my son had the Wyoming Whiskey.  They said great flavor and cooked right. Husband said fries slightly under done and soggy and would order them well done next time.  I tried both the mac & cheese and lobster mac & cheese.  (I ended up getting both because of an order mix up) . At this point I will have to give this another chance because after eating these side by side I can't say if my taste buds were able to distinguish what was going on with either one of these. My dad had the turkey avocado club and didn't come up for air. All visits included adult beverages where the bar staff is excellent. That's going to keep this place alive here.  The menu could be streamlined for our lifestyle here we just don't have the attention span or time of those who live in Wyoming.  Keep up the effort and hard work and we'll keep coming back and recommending this place.",

At first the manager was taking care of tables. We quickly realized the manager was taking care of most of the tables. My salad was finally brought out and I had to pick out a large pile of wilted lettuce disguised by mixing it with iceberg lettuce. Because I am diabetic and have foods I cannot eat, I was anxious to eat a meal as I was beginning to not feel so well from the long wait. I asked the manager what was going on. She was pleasant at first, until we asked her what was up with the hour wait for our dinner. She gave a sharp remark which we felt was not necessary. After waiting for an hour & 15 min for two meals.....my husbands food was Luke warm and my Sea Bass was Luke warm, dry, the fish color was brownish fish, instead of flaky white. The taste was so bad I refused to take another bite, fearing it could be spoiled. We were so upset that we told the manager forget it and walked out. Other patrons were complaining over their wait as well. If there is a problem, be honest, don't keep your guest in the dark - it only makes waiting so long more maddening by being ignored. I don't see this place lasting much longer if something isn't fixed!",

Everything on the menu sounded amazing and thanks to our phenomenal waitress Angie, we were able to pick out some appetizers and lunch items. We had the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. Dipped in their sauce these things were amazing. We also ordered the FireRock Burger and BBQ pork sandwich. The burger is actually ground steak and the BBQ pork were huge chunks of meat. Each item was fabulous. We will definitely be going back and asking for Angie. She was so helpful in making our decisions. Our drink glasses were always topped off and the conversation with her was delightful. She is an absolute asset to that restaurant. I highly recommend trying this place out.",

At first, we waited an hour to be seated(this wasn't a big deal, I've waited this long at other restaurants). After being seated, the server took our drink order and took 20 minutes to bring them to us. Not only did it take this long just for drinks, but she only brought out 2 of our drinks then took another 5 to bring out the other two. After that, she took our food order and didn't come check on us until after the runners brought out our food an hour and ten minutes later. Not only was this an extremely long wait, but others who were seated AFTER we were, got their food long before we did. The server never gave us silver wear, so we had to ask the runners for some. To continue the disappointment, our food was all cold. The server also never told us there were no mashed potatoes, so they brought out steak fries instead without asking for a side replacement. We were still waiting on a couple other items, but just decided to cancel them because we refused to wait any longer. The manager came over to talk to us and offered to take $50 off of our bill, but other tables around us called him over as he was walking away to complain as well. Extremely disappointed with everything about this evening, both the service and food. Would never recommend this place to anyone. And refuse to return.",

The waitress forgot to put in our order. But she owned up to it and was nice enough. But then they switched waitresses in the middle of our meal which added to the confusion. Finally an hour after sitting down we had our steaks. They offer no water mind you. The beef carpaccio was bland. My filet medallions were chewier than a tennis ball. If i had dentures they woulda been on fire from all that chewing. The crusted ribeye was ok tho. I think if your gonna try to be a steakhouse the meat and service need to be on point. In this case they were not. For less $ we coulda went to BJ's across the street and had better service and food. I hate to bash this place cause i was hoping to have a solid steakhouse near by. But i dont think ill be going back anytime soon:-(",

    "text": "Finally had a chance to try out this much needed addition to the local eateries in Centennial Hills.  Parking was easy and the interior very welcoming.  We chose to eat at a high top table in the bar area.  Lots of televisions around so it doesn't matter where you sit, you'll always have a view.  Its also noisy so if you want something more intimate, try the dining room.  A mini-tablet served as a drink menu and I had a delicious Old Fashion.  My partner ordered a glass of wine.  She ordered the 8 ounce version.  She was brought the 6 ounce instead.  Hmmmm.  Our server may have tried to impress with her memory skills instead of writing down our order.  That was a mistake.  Besides messing up the wine order she also screwed up one of the salad requests.  Dressing was ordered on the side.  It wasn't.  When we remarked on it she didn't offer to correct it.  She just said, \"Dressing is already on the salad.\". No apologies.  My wedge with blue cheese was refreshing.  And the complimentary rolls were marvelous.  My partner ordered the Beer Can Chicken which came with a side of mac and cheese.  Both quite tasty.  Although the latter was too garlicky for my taste.  I ordered a ribeye (this is billed as a steak house afterall) with a side of broccoli with cheese sauce.  A major disappointment.  Both were blander than bland.  And the entrees were delivered while we were still working on the salads.  So that high top table got real crowded.  The tasteless steak was cooked to my medium rare specification.  But someone needs to let the kitchen staff know that they need to let the water drain from the veggies before adding the cheese sauce.  That dish looked horrible with the broccoli drowning in the watered down cheese soup.  The pricing is right and I'll wait a few weeks before returning so that the kitchen staff can get their act together.  For a steakhouse they need to improve if they're going to compete with the likes of Bob Taylor's or the Charcoal Room.",

He had a loaded baked potato and I had mashed potatoes and broccoli. The potato was 3.95 and it had some cheese and some bacon and it was a little cold. We had to ask for more bacon and for the potato to be reheated. We ordered the steak medium and it came back medium well. The broccoli wasn't tasty at all. The second steak was cooked properly and it was really delicious. Cooked and seasoned really well.

We were excited to try some place we hadn't been. Our waiters were pleasant. We had a waiter in training and he was so nice. Ok so we place our order. We got the stuffed mushrooms. Two bacon wrapped filets and a chicken fried steak. The mushrooms and our salads come out and were so good. The bread they serve is seriously amazing. My boyfriends order of chicken fried steak comes out but not the two filets. He said his food was hot and tasted good. My mom and I sit there for 10 minutes before our waitress comes by and asks if we need boxes? Wait what? We never got our food. We inform her of this and she goes back to the kitchen. Comes back and tells us that our orders were put on two separate tickets. At this point we ask to speak to a manager. We sit there for a while longer and our food arrives. The manager comes over to apologize and make sure everything is ok. It wasn't. Our steaks were ice cold and our potatoes weren't even warm. The bacon was falling off of mine and it was just poor presentation. But the real issue was that there was a bone in my moms steak. There shouldn't be bone in a filet. The manager kindly takes all three plates of food back to be remade. They bring the food back and my boyfriends food is still good! Mine and my moms is still cold and undercooked. Unfortunately we didn't eat anything besides one or two bites. The manager kindly took care of the bill. I will be waiting awhile to come back.",

I love their food, but their service is mediocre at best. The manager is nowhere to be seen. I've only seen him once during my visit. We prefer eating outside but they apparently can't staff that. At the bar, either it's packed or if you go later the bartenders are too busy cleaning & setting up for the next day that they forget that they have customers. Are they ready for prime time? I'd have to say NO!!",

Took over 25 minutes to get our appetizers. They actually  offered us bread cause it was taking so long. Got our dinner almost an hour later. Food was good. Got our bill and we had salads that we didn't order or eat on the bill. Wine my girlfriend  ordered was more then the menu said. I wouldn't go back here because it seems like we were getting ripped off.",

She finally made her pit stop and said she would be right with us. Next thing we know, a new waitress, Samantha, came up to help us and told us that she would be taking care of us because our waitress was super busy. Samantha is the *ish!! She also serves as the bartender and is hands down one of the best servers I have come across in this town. Great personality, takes care of her guests, absolute sweetheart and a bad *ss at her job. What we thought was going to be a shoddy night of service turned in to a FANTASTIC evening! Also a shout out to our food runner/busser Francisco !! He was attentive, friendly and always had a smile on his face. Great night all in all!! We will ALWAYS ask for Samantha when we come here - even if we have to wait.",

    "text": "I don't get what the big deal about this place is or how it possibly has such good ratings?  Is it my fault because I went for lunch instead of dinner and then ordered the highlighted fish tacos off their menu rather then a ribeye?  Maybe!  I had wanted to come here for quite awhile and finally made it in yesterday.  Our server was Sandy.  She was pretty nice though she forgot our salads until I asked about them, and although the fish tacos said you could choose a side she only offered me Caesar or house salad.  So sweet potato fries were out of the question I guess.  I wanted them but didn't push it because maybe salad would be healthier.  The Caesar was covered in dressing pockets that I ate around because it just seemed gross.  The fish tacos seemed stale.  I couldn't put my finger on it if it was because there were slightly cold, not very crispy or if it was the tortilla, the weak vegetation of slaw on it or the not very avocado-like sauce on top.  This was no different then eating at Chili's.  In fact if I had gone to Rubio's it would have been cheaper, better service and better food.  I didn't order dessert because there was only one chocolate item on it (I dislike fruit-based desserts) and it was supposed to be giant.  Oh well.  I had been excited about trying this place so I am disappointed.  I really wanted a nice place in Centennial that I could order a variety of foods at.  This is not it.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "We recently visited this resturant for happy hour and sat at the bar. To our dismay we felt so unwelcome by our bartendar Kim. Her attitude was entirely unprofessional. She took her time taking our orders and when she brought us our drinks, it was placed on the bar four feet away from us, where my husband had to get up and get the drinks for us. The entire time we observed her, she seemed displeased with serving. We even saw her roll her eyes several times as she was pouring beer in the glasses. She didn't greet us, like all the others that we saw. We waited almost 30 minuites to order or appetizers and she gave us a bit of an attitude when we asked for a drink and appetizer menu. Although the food was delicious, unfortunately, the service she provided was so unfriendly we almost walked out. The manager seemed to be very nice to everyone around us and so were the other bartenders. My husband was upset the whole night when we returned because of this. The catch all was she took three other bills before closing our tab, which took 20 minuites. We probably will not return to happy hour. There are alot of establishments that offer happy hour. Thankgoodness our friends couldn't join us, because I know they would have commented as well.  The saying \" One Bad Apple Can Spoil the Bunch\" is absoultey True. She had the gul to ask us to push our plates closer to her after we ate. She didn't give us that same courtesy with our drinks. This is for management, she needs training in customer service.",

    "text": "Nice new addition to Centennial Hills! Our server Canary was super friendly and suggested the sangria, which was very good.   Simple menu with some good basics- we went with spinach artichoke dip, pecan maple pork tenderloin, and smothered chicken.   Dip was good, and arrived the same time as some Rosemary hot rolls, that were warm and soft. Our food came out quickly- my chicken was good, nothing mind-blowing, but no complaints. It was a very large portion, as was my baked potato. The potato was a little underdone for my taste, but there was so much of it, it was a nonissue.   My husband said his pork was good but it tasted whole grain mustard more than maple or pecan. He wasn't super impressed with his mashed potatoes.  We skipped dessert knowing we were heading to Aliante Nature Park for shave ice.  3.5 would be the most accurate rating. It was a basic steakhouse; good place for families. Service was great. It was nicely decorated and a huge change from the place that used to be in this space. We would come back.",

The firecracker shrimp was mild, near flavorless, and badly over cooked to the point of being almost burnt.   The meatballs were good but nothing special.    The worst were the mixed drinks.   Ok, I understand it's happy hour and they're not going to be extravagant with the alcohol,  but if there was any actual booze in the drinks, neither I nor my partner could taste it.  Booooo.

The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls are awesome as are the stuffed mushrooms.  I would pass on the crab cakes which are not so good in my opinion.  I would avoid the bar area where service is slow and inconsistent. They need to hire more staff.  The dining room is a much better experience.",

The steamed and seasoned broccoli and macaroni and cheese were very good, too.  My husband had an ahi burger and he enjoyed it, but he would order something different next time.  We ate outside on the covered patio which we enjoyed until sunset left it completely dark.  There was so little lighting that I could hardly see my food.  I was trying to eat around the skin of my sweet potato, but I could not see clearly due to the lack of sufficient lighting.  If they installed some brighter lighting, that outdoor area would be spectacular.",

I opted for the Chicken Dijonnaise, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. I needed them to bring me MORE of the Dijonnaise sauce because it was so delicious. The potatoes had just a few lumps, which I love. I used some of the Dinonnaise sauce as s gravy on my mashed potato & can I just say...YUM!! We tried the regular Mac & Cheese and that was great too!

We get home and our mash potatoes are all in one box . They have no flavor or seasoning at all. The \"full \" rack of ribs is tiny and full of fat . Not edible . We didn't get any bread at all. So all in all we threw it away and wasted $60 . We won't be ordering from here again .",

    "text": "My wife and I went to FireRock this weekend.  We were told there would be a 10 minute wait.  We were in line when we noticed open seats in the bar area where they do a full service.  So we took a bar area seat.  After 10 minutes, the waitress came by and tried to take our drink order. I asked what their darkest draft beer was and the waitress said she would have to go check.  After she left, I saw her delivering drinks to several other tables but did not come back. At this point, we decided to see if we were still in line for a regular table.  We were told we weren't.  A manager heard and he came to the table, gave me a taste of their dark beer Moose Drool.  I said I would take one of those.  We say him talk to the waitress who continued serving other tables.  After about a half hour with no drinks we walked out.   We have eaten there before and really liked it.  Management needs to focus on their service and follow through when things come to  their attention.  Not sure we will try again.  We ended up at Montana Meat Company and had a great meal with great service!",

Right away I noticed our server Andrea was very attentive and helpful. My friend ordered a Manhattan and I ordered an Old Fashioned. When the drinks came out they were not only really good but even the presentation was nice. The food was also very good. It arrived quickly and exactly as ordered and it was nice and hot. I didn't get a steak this time but I will next time cause I will definitely be back. We talked to the manager who was also really nice, she said they were under new management which may explain the previous bad reviews. The new management has certainly turned things around.",

Fire Rock management needs to realize that people want to come in, eat their breakfast and get on with their day. Fire Rock-- no matter where you go on Sundays to eat breakfast, it is busy. You should seriously consider hiring additional staff to cover the busy times, like weekends.  Again, customers want to eat their breakfast and get on with their day. They don't want to wait nearly 2 hours to eat breakfast. This is a huge opportunity for this restaurant.  Also, this morning, the coffee pot was broken, so it took about 20 minutes just to get one cup of coffee. For breakfast, this is unacceptable.",

The food was 1 Star the only reason why I gave it 2 overall stars was because the server was decent.Everything thing we had was either dry or over cooked or both. We had the shrimp appetizer and wings both were awful the ribs were dry and over cooked and the bolognese tasted canned. We sat in a booth that had ants crawling on the wall, they moved us no problem but resat the booth 15 min later..smh  another server, serving a table beside us dropped a drink and never once looked around to see if it splashed anywhere else as my husband had the drink all over his jeans and I had it running down my leg and on my shoes. The overall experience was a nightmare, it was really a shame. Clearly we won't be back.",

    "text": "I was a bit skeptical about this place and almost canceled our reservations based on the reviews.  We never have a babysitter, but we had family visiting and this was our 3rd visit out, without kids. I had a free app coupon and I liked how this restaurant was on our side of town so we went ahead with the reservation.  I decided to schedule the reservation early, in case we did have problems with service, so we could still make it to a movie.  Our reservations were for 5:30 on a Monday.  They weren't very busy upon arrival. We were greeted immediately and taken to our preferred seating, a booth.  Our server, Brittney, showed up quickly. Apparently, it was still Happy Hour and they do serve the discounted apps & drinks at the tables. There were good prices, but we weren't interested.  I had a coupon for a free app, but I typically don't like to get appetizers and prefer dessert.  Brittney asked her manager and they okayed our switch to a free dessert.  I didn't find the rolls to be great. They tasted frozen and had a \"not fresh\" taste, but the garlic & sea salt sprinkled on top improved their flavor. They really should look into a different bread option as bread is a staple at steak restaurants.  Husband ordered a full rack of ribs and I got the sirloin and shrimp combo.  I would've preferred a better cut of steak and I will ask next time. The steak was flavorful though and I received 3 large grilled shrimp.  Husband was happy with his ribs, but it was too much food so he didn't finish.  Our server was constantly at our table, making sure we had everything we needed. We didn't wait for anything, including the bill, which was nice.  The restaurant did begin to fill up as we were there, but that didn't affect our service at all.  We will return the next time we have a babysitter.",

She also had about 6 other tables. It took about 10 mins until she got our drink order and another 10 before we got them. I got a soda but my husband ordered a Sapphire and tonic. I'm not sure where the bartender learned how to make a gin and tonic, but it's usually in a small glass, not the same size as a water/soda glass!  I ordered the 10 oz prime rib with Mac n cheese and a salad. My husband ordered a ribeye with steak fries and a salad. The salads were nothing special. Just bagged lettuce and smothered in ranch. My prime rib was ok. The edges were extremely salty. The mac n cheese was gross. It was an extra $1.50 and it had absolutely no taste! I had to add some of the creamy horseradish to even make it edible. My husband said his ribeye was good, but it came over cooked. He said he's just eat it because he didn't want to wait 30 mins to get another one. We didn't have any dessert because it was almost 9pm and we just wanted to go home.  Also, this place was freezing cold! I always bring a sweater with me, but I was still cold even with it on. And the music was strange! It was Frank Sinatra alternating with bad 80's. It was confusing. I love Frank Sinatra, but just keep it to one type, don't mix to types that don't go together.  I'd possibly try this place again. Maybe for lunch. But I've had friends and family try this place and they all had the same experience. Mediocre food and bad service.",

This is ***regarding a phone call*** I made to the Las Vegas location where I asked for Eric the manager ( per THERE website) who's also been responding to the postings here in Yelp.  We have no interest in going there at all after this experience. On their website they have specials.   Today is Monday.  THERE Monday special buy one entree get the second entree at 50% off.  Well you canNOT sign up online and get the special unless you get a card FIRST at the restaurant with a special number on it.  So what's the use of signing up online.  Read on this is ridiculous.  So I signed up for this and it's been almost  one hour and 20 minutes and I still have not gotten an email from them. Found out later you need a card first.  I called and ask for Eric THERE IS ^^^^NO^^^^  *Eric* there and they don't know who he is. ?????  In my opinion if they cannot even manage a website and get names on their website correct then they cannot manage a restaurant either.  I wouldn't even bother going there save yourself some time and go somewhere else. .",

(Not a fan of flimsy fries) it also came with a wonderful house salad which was nothing spectacular but still good :) the bread is similar to the kind they serve you at macaroni grill but not as crunchy super fresh. my sister loved her chicken and the mashed potatoes WERE PHENOMENAL. (and I love mashed potatoes) it was about 3:15pm so not too many people in the restaurant. the service was good but not great. with so little people in the restaurant I would hope I wouldn't have to ask for a refill, twice or a side of ranch twice but I'm okay with human errors if food was is up to par :) would definitely go back again!",

When we questioned it, both the host and the manager agreed they need to add that to the menu so people know. We said you shouldn't be charging that extra fee until you correct it. Again both agreed but neither one offered to refund. Many would say it's just $2.50 but honestly it's not about the money. It's the principle of how many other hidden up charges do they add that people don't notice or question. Very dishonest and disappointing. We will miss Dave the bartender as he was one of the main reasons we kept coming back. He was not there tonight or I'm sure he would have at least mentioned the up charge when we ordered the salad.",

    "text": "In January 2017 we requested reservations for my uncle's 60th birthday dinner on April 8th.  For 25 people.  They said no problem.  Fast forward to March 30th we received an email from them with a 'group dining menu'.  Had 4 options ranging from $35 to $47 a person.  Confused I called them asking why they sent me a group dining menu(We were planning on just ordering from the menu). They informed me THEN that we had to use the group dining menu so they could accommodate a party of 25 people.  Are you kidding me??  I then asked if we could make our own dining menu since the options (very little) were awful and honestly more expensive then the actual menu prices.  They said they would call me back....and surprise surprise they NEVER called back.   Luckily we found a new place to have my uncles dinner at and they had NO problem accommodating 25 people.  This place needs new management.  I'm very surprised it's a chain.  Extremely disappointed and I would think twice if you plan on eating here. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.",

Spacious layout so you don't feel like you are right on top of other patrons.  Server was Rick.  He was very friendly and professional.  Prices are commensurate with other steak/seafood places.  Started with stuffed mushrooms.  They were really good and only $5 on happy hour menu.  I had the mushroom Swiss burger.  It was cooked nicely but didn't have much flavor.  My wife had the ribs and shrimp.  The ribs were pretty bland too.  The shrimp was good. We also had the firecracker shrimp, which was really good.  Kids corn dogs were good and came with a generous portion of fruit.",

    "text": "We have eaten at FireRock 7 times since they opened.  The 1st and 2nd times were good, the service was excellent and the food was great.  The 3rd time the food was good and the service was poor.  The 4th time we waited 10 minutes at the bar to get a bar tender to greet us and another 5 minutes to get 2 beers.  The 5th time we sat there for 5 minutes, had a bar tender tell us they he would be right with us and then we sat for another 10 minutes and finally, we walked out.  The 6th time I went with some friends and we sat at a table and had great service and the food was good.  The 7th (and last time I will ever patronize FireRock) we went in, sat at the bar, waited for 8 minutes (yes we timed it) and then the bartender asked us for our order.  I ordered a beer because it was my birthday.  He brought the beer and then disappeared for over 10 minutes and we paid for the beer and left.  Now, I am not one to pass judgement on an establishment if they have a rough night and hence our 7 attempts to make FireRock our go to local hangout failed.  They have lost us as future customers and unless they get their service act together, they may not survive the very competitive Las Vegas restaurant market.  So many great places to spend our hard earned money at for a good meal and great food.  FireRock is not one of those places.",

Took forever for our food to arrive and when it did, the soup was not hot. I had the Prime Dip sandwich, it was horrible! Only had about two slices of beef(usually a dip sandwich would be piled high, since it is sliced so thin). The lettuce wrap only had enough filling for two of the four lettuce leaves. This place has really gone down hill. I went when they first opened and it was great,not so now. Will never eat there again.",

We were seated without a drink menu, my husband ordered a margarita and I a water until I saw the drink menu. She brought the drink menu and I ordered their infused vodka along with an appetizer. I made eye contact with our waitress on two occasions as she quickly had that look \"oh I forgot\" and walked away. She brought our salads, which were strangely different, my husband had two croutons and none of the parmesan cheese that I had but we laughed and said she must have liked me better. When she brought our salads she stated they had run out of the infused vodka, at 6pm? Okay, I'll just drink my water, although my glass was empty. Our appetizers were then brought out by a food runner, which were good, and then our meal also by a food runner. We NEVER saw our waitress again until we had completed our meal. In the meantime we asked another waitress for salt and pepper for my loaded baked potato and some of the bread that was supposed to be served. Once we had completed our meal, minus the baked potato which I didn't eat without salt or pepper, she showed up with bread, salt and pepper. It was too late we were done! Luckily another server filled my glass of water once. I'm not unreasonable and know servers get busy but this was ridiculous!",

If this was a hotel lobby, I'd be very pleased. Unfortunately it isnt, and it's a place I got stuck eating at. For starters, we had the spinach dip. It was flavorless and luke warm, at best. My brother ordered the ribs, which were fatty and pink, and once again lukewarm. My burger was so so, and there was something terribly wrong with our french fries. They tasted like propone and made us sick to our stomachs!! We felt guilty in complaining, and did so nicely. However, our waitress was pissed as hell that we did and spent the rest of the night ignoring us. We left sucking on free mints from a bowl at the hostess stand, and sad to say, that was the culinary highlight of our night.",

    "text": "I have had great experiences at FireRock before but my most recent one was disappointing. While my party was ordering food, the waiter and waitress asked if we wanted soup or salad. I asked them to list what kind of soup comes with the order. I chose french onion soup (I asked the waiter to list what soups the order comes with and he listed this as one) as did a few others at my table. We then go our food and my ribs were dry and tough to eat. I had to ask for more sauce because it was too dry and hard to eat. My husband ordered a medium rare steak but it came looking really red. When we asked the manager about the steak, she said thats how it should be properly cooked. She said \"medium rare should be more pink in the center.\" This was not pink, it was red. Another person at my table found a piece of hard plastic in her ice cream as well.   When the checks finally came (which took a long time), many of us found out we were being charged $2.99 extra to order the french onion soup. We were then told that its an upcharge for that specific soup. No one told us that it would be an upcharge. The waitress said it says so on the menu but we all failed to find where it said that. The waitress then admitted that she failed to let us know of the upcharge because she was training someone and forgot. We asked for the manager and she told us \"now I'm irritated that I have to take off $9 worth of food off these tickets.\" This was rude and inappropriate.    In total, we were there for over two hours mostly waiting for service. Only the waiter in training checked up on us once during the entire time. Unfortunately, I don't think my husband and I will be coming back.",

First, there were no silverware on our table but I think that's the hostess' job to make sure we do have when we were seated. Second, she remembered the steak sauce I asked for when I'm halfway done already. My husband ordered Pesto Primavera and I ordered Ribeye Steak medium well. It was tasty until the middle turned out to be well done. Middle part should be slightly pink. So next time, if ever, I'll order my steak medium. I enjoyed the potato soup that came with the meal. It's delicious. Disappointing that we're celebrating Birthday which I disclosed on the reservation and we were not even asked if we care for dessert.",

    "text": "We arrived about 3:30 PM for Happy Hour on Thursday 12/27 and it wasn't too busy. As others have mentioned the atmosphere is warm and welcoming but that ends right there. We sat at the bar where there was no gaming along with about 8 others. We ordered two drinks and I immediately received mine however my companion ordered a margarita on the rocks and we have no idea where the bartender went or what the problem was but she went and waited on a couple playing the slots and then finally brought our other drink which I was half finished with mine at that point. We ordered 4 different appetizers and they were delivered in a timely manner. My silverware was dirty and it took a while to get anyone's attention to get clean ones. At this point, there are three bartenders so eventually flagged one down to get a second drink and I asked for a Vodka Soda exactly what was sitting in front of me. Being right at the well I could see her pick up a bucket class and I asked if I could please have it tall like the one clearly sitting right in front of me. After trying to upsell me to an expensive vodka instead of the well she threw the ice, slammed the bucket glass down and reached for a tall. Geezzz!!!!! During the entire visit the bartenders were nonexistent unless you were gambling. All three of them hovered over the gamblers and paid no attention to anyone else. I almost got up to walk over to where they were glued to get our check. One of the bartenders went so far as to come out from behind the bar and stood right next to a person playing the slots. All three of them were obvious in the fact that they were waiting for someone to hit a jackpot and they would be right there for the big tip while the rest of us were just a nuisance. Unbelievable !!! To sum it up is one word MANAGEMENT...they definitely need some. BJ's Brewery is right up the street with friendly staff and good food so that's where you will find me from now on !!!",

The pancakes were so good and melted in your mouth.    The only concern I had is that the waiter was taking too long to bring things back, such as, drinks or anything else that was asked for. The checks had the wrong items on them and he even shorted the change on one of the guest that I was with. I'm not sure it they were short-handed on staff that day because it wasn't busy at all.   I will go back because the breakfast was delicious and hopefully one day I will try the lunch or dinner.",

Took a long time for him to actually greet us and when he did his words were \"What can I get you guys\" I'm a server and was FLOORED by this!! No \"hi how is everyone, my name is...\" Never went over any specials or soup of the night, disappointing start. When we ordered the appetizer sample he said great and just walked away before I could even get the words out of my mouth that I also wanted to put in my daughter's meal.  Never acknowledged us when the apps came out, took 20 mins for 2 waters, never acknowledged us when our dinners came! I had to stand up and flag him down to tell him my husbands beer can chicken was sooo dry he couldn't even eat it and order a steak. No apology.. While waiting for my husband to finish eating because he got his steak when me and my daughter were finished I reallllly wanted a coffee but sure enough had no server to order it with!!!  The only positive thing I can say is I've never been more dedicated to being a great server! I would never want anyone I served leaving feeling the way I did at Fire Rock. Oh and the sangria is delicious",

Today I walked in with the wife and the place was almost empty. We sat down and the hostess gave us menus. The guy bartending looked right at us and just kept on doing everything other than serving customers. What a waste. They don't have dedicated servers for the bar area so everyone has to sit around waiting. It's almost like they don't want your money.   This place will probably go out of business because it is a crappy place to go. I'm sure the steaks are great, good luck getting someone to serve you one. Never again.  Get it together Firerock.",

We had the back corner to ourselves, it was quiet, and great for catching up as we had not seen each other for a few months. I wanted lunch and my friend wanted breakfast - \"no problem\" said our friendly waiter Donnie.   I had the potato soup which I love - it is really good - thick, with chunks of potato and a garnish of bacon and onions.  I also had a bloody mary which they do just right, love them both. My friend had a bacon, mushroom and cheese omelette and wanted to substitute fruit for potato's \"no problem\" - that's the way they are - nothing is ever a problem, they are always friendly and nice and that is why we will keep coming back.",

    "text": "Expectations might play a role here: this is a steakhouse out in the burbs, not exactly the center of culture and culinary sophistication. So my expectations going in weren't exactly high.  But, the steak medallions I had were tasty, good enough for me to say they justified the price tag, though I found the sauce accompanying them to be not quite as good. The important thing is that the steak was cooked properly, if perhaps a bit overcooked--i ordered medium rare, I'd say I got something slightly closer to medium. But a fairly minor complaint, the important thing being that it is a steakhouse that properly cooked its meat.  The sides were meh--very much your standard sides, with a not so fresh tasting salad and a sweet potato. Service was friendly and did a reasonably good job with a large party.  Misc notes: * I guess there are video slots around but I didn't see them. The section we were in didn't have a gaming feel to it, which for me is a good thint. * I can't really think of other noteworthy things to say. It was a palatable but not particularly memorable meal",

But this is what I received.  The Caesar salad that came with it was entirely overdressed.  The sandwich had extremely small pieces of beef, which is nearly impossible to cook to temp.

    "text": "We chose this place Bc it was close to the house and a steakhouse we hadn't tried before. I may return to try their happy hour but I was totally unimpressed with our dining experience. I ordered wedge salad baked potato soup and appetizer mussels for my entree. Wedge salad didn't have blue cheese crumbles on it ... no biggie .. shoe string onions were soggy ... didn't have that crunch to them .. the bacon they use for their soup and salad is not fresh bacon. It's like commercial bought bacon bits ... so they were clumped together and hard and cold ... like how hard is it to make fresh bacon bits ?? But that's ok .. so onto the mussels .. they were pretty small and the sauce is relatively flavorless ... it is almost like a cream based sauce which is weird ... it's thick... ok onTo the service ... she brought me an iced tea with no ice in it ... I asked for ice never got it and I never received a refill on my drink ... which is weird Bc my date got a refill .. I can't recommend this place after my meal :.. I could probably give this place one star but my date liked his steak ...   Update .... Whew ... apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. I wanted a ribeye I wanted a salad ... closest \"steakhouse\" to me ...  I regret coming here .. I'm updating my review to 1 star. Ok so I order a wedge salad ... it was fine .. no complaints .. they fixed the bacon bit issue and the onion straws were crispy ....  we head on to the steak ....  I don't actually believe I was given a ribeye ...  it was the thinnest cut of steak I have ever ordered and paid for at a restaurant ... MAYBE half an inch thick ... I asked for medium ... it was well done ... i couldn't eat it ... it was literally DRYYYYYY !!!!  I asked for extra Cajun butter to loosen it up ... nope .. didn't help .. i took it home to my dog ... I ate maybe 3 bites of it ...  it was supposed to be 12 ounces .. again  Not convinced  I have bought thicker ... more marbled... juicy steaks from the grocery store ... for half the price ...  not worth what they're charging for ...   They do make a house made infused vodka ... not bad  But I will never come here to eat food again",

All three of us ordered cups of soup - tasty but a little pricey for only a cup of soup ($4.00 a cup). My daughter ordered fish and chips - which was nicely presented and tasty.  I ordered a Greek salad and was very disappointed - no red onions as listed on their menu, tiny bits of feta cheese, a few finely chopped olives, and half a breast of chicken which was over cooked and flavorless.  My wife ordered a Caprese salad - plenty of baby argula,  a few vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh basil and two small pieces of mozzarella cheese.   I expected more and was disappointed - will not return to the FireRock in the future.",

(Only reason for the 2 stars basically)  Cons: horrible tasting steak, unless you like an over smoked taste, in which case...it would taste perfect. Ordered a smothered chicken plate with a side of broccoli- the chicken came out luke warm at best, broccoli was warmer, but cooked just a step above raw.  Twice we came here and it seems the average time to get your meal after ordering is roughly 30-40 minutes.   Looks like a nice steak house, but then you get a paper table cloth and crayons?...if I'm going to pay 30-50$ for steak, can I get a real table cloth?    Management was super nice and did try to settle the situation immediately. But I was already over it. Last attempt for this spot...centennial hills strikes out again!",

    "text": "Ambience: 3.5 stars; Service: 3.5 stars.  Food: 5 stars.  We dined at FireRock tonight after hearing about it from a friend.  We ordered the crab cake (appetizer), rib-eye (with cajun seasoning), and the fire-roasted salad. Prices are very reasonable, particularly given the huge portions.  Crab cake was huge, tasted fresh, and was moist.  Ratio of bread crumbs to crab was good.  The only thing I didn't like is that the sauce that accompanies the crab cake is too sweet (and there is too much of it) and it overpowers the taste of the crab cake.  So sauce: crab cake ratio was too high. Fire roasted salad was good.  I could only eat half!  Menu says that romaine is roasted, but tasted like simple romaine straight from the grocery store.  So, they either need to change their menu description or they need to roast the romaine more thoroughly. Salad comes with a chicken breast, which was perfectly seasoned and tender. My dining companion had the rib-eye. The meat was well seasoned (but not really cajun seasoned), and tender.  The mushrooms were awesome.  Unfortunately, the side dish of sauteed vegetables was a disaster.  Vegetables appeared as though they were three days old and there was nothing special about them.  No seasoning, etc.  Certainly were not sauteed; appeared to be wilted and steamed. Clearly appeared as an afterthought to the steak. You might do better to order to fries or something else.  Service okay, unremarkable, uninspired.  That said, we will likely return because my partner loves steak and they did that really well.",

And the service leaves a lot to be desired.  I ordered the New York steak (32.95) with a wedge salad, my brother ordered the Smothered Chicken with the soup of the day.  We sat and talked and quite a bit of time went by, no bread, no nothing.  Then, the runner came with my wedge salad, but not the soup.  Then seriously, 30 seconds later, before I had time to even bite into the salad, here come the entrees.  I told the runner, \"I just got this salad about 30 seconds ago, and my brother ordered soup, which is still not here.\"  So they just brought the soup.  The runner was very apologetic, but it wasn't her fault - we never heard from our server again til the bill arrived.  No apologies for the ridiculous timing.  My brother said his entree was pretty good.  My steak was terrible - I took one bite, and it was gross - a weird rubbery texture, like maybe it had been FROZEN.  But whatever the reason - it was bad.  I've had better steaks at the Sizzler.  I took it home and gave it to the dogs.  Never saw a manager either - and they could really use one!",

My husband had ordered the scallops and there were only 4 on the plate with cold rice, that wasn't even enough to feed a child.  The rolls were hard and cold.  My rib eye was the only thing that was good about the meal.  A different waiter comes out and brings lobster to our table, which we advised we did not order.  The waitress comes back and she blamed the kitchen crew for messing up the order for lobster, as she said she had as lobster mac and cheese.  My mother-in-law then asks for the manager.  While waiting, the waitress comes with our check for the meal, with a charge for lobster on it.  We point this out, then after 10 mins or so the manager comes over.  We explained our experience  to him and then he proceeded to tell us that he only knew about the lobster and took that off the bill for us, like he was doing us a favor.  He didn't do one thing about our bill, even though 95% of the meal was cold.  My mother-in-law paid the check and we started to leave.  The waitress caught us outside and handed us a $50.00 gift card.  I am not one to ever complain about a meal or ask for anything; however, in this case the manager should have reduced the entire meal or not charged us for anything but our drinks.  A $50 gift card is bullshit, as I don't ever want to go back there.  The meal was probably $150 and to top it off, after we looked over the receipt later, we were charged for my mash potatoes that were supposed to have been included in the charge of my meal.  If anyone goes there to eat, I would recommend that you look carefully at your bill before paying and definitely don't pay if you get a meal like we did.  Awful experience and awful service.  The manager should be ashamed of himself.",

    "text": "We went for dinner last night, our first experience was a couple of weeks ago.  Food was night that great so we decided to give it another try.  We placed our order for drinks and appetizer.  Out drinks (water, ice tea and wine) took 20 min.  Appetizer came, had ordered or dinner (decided to try the Rib Eye) and soup.  Asked for soup to come before dinner.  Did not happen soup came with dinner.  My baked potato was cold, had to ask for bread and still no wine yet!  Had to ask for the glass of wine.  Our waitress said you still want it?  Wouldn't of ordered it if we didn't want it.  Tried to get her attention to let her know about the potato being cold.  Never saw her.  Finally she comes around wanting to know if she can refill water and Ice Tea.  We said yes, never received it.  Then she comes around to see if we want dessert.  By now and 2 1/2hrs later only seeing our waitress 3 times maybe 4.  I told her I just really wanted our check so we could go and that we were tired of waiting trying to get service.  Food was not that good and service was horrible.  We will not go back.  Two times and both were bad experiences.  True fully down the street you can get much better service and Steaks at MONTANA'S.  The service here really SUCKS!!!!",

    "text": "We were really excited to try this place but from the get-go, the food was a disaster. We ordered Ahi tuna for an appetizer which was very overcooked.  The medium-rare filet mignon I ordered was instead cooked well-done, and the most flavorful part of the steak was the bacon wrapped around it.  The asparagus we ordered was woody and over-cooked.  My friend's Mahi was so dry and flaky that she couldn't even eat it.  The manager was very nice and was receptive of our criticisms and gave us free dessert and stressed that they wanted the feedback to improve.  Our server, however, looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but there--even prior to our complaints.  The best part of the meal was the bread and the creme-brulee cheesecake.  I give it two stars--the extra start because the manager was very kind and and seemed eager to make improvements.",

She forgot my water for 20 minutes but had served everyone else their beverages already. She dropped my spoon for my soup, which I didn't care, and she said she'd bring me a new one. She never came back with the spoon... Kind of irritating. I was waiting so long that I had to ask another waitress for a spoon. My French onion soup was topped off with provolone cheese which was quite awkward and I sent it back. I just couldn't believe they'd put that cheese on there. No thank you. I sent it back and waited another 10 minutes for a potato soup. By the time my soup came out I was already eating my entree! Very chaotic. The soups & salads were served far too close to main entrees. Overall, bad waitress and service but the food was delicious minus the choice of cheese lol. The cooks are doing a good job. Back of house, thank you. The food definitely made up for the lack of service.",

One way we evaluate a restaurant is by the soup.  Their soup is watery and lacks taste (not savory).  Last time we were there I tried their turkey burger.  It was under cooked and the lettuce was yellow and strewn on in small pieces.  We like to go there because it is one of the few non-smoking restaurants in town that has gaming, but the quality of their food and the preparation needs a serious upgrade and is not representative of an upscale restaurant.",

My BF recalled driving by this place, so armed with Yelp reviews, thought we'd  try Fire Rock. So glad we did!  At first, I wasn't sure what to expect because it's kind of a hybrid mix of neighborhood bar and fancy steakhouse.   Our server was friendly, but kind of flitted between tables, so they must have been short staffed that night.  It also took a long time to get our drinks. But what was lacking in timely service was sure made up for in the gargantuan, fantastically seasoned Cajun butter ribeye bone-in steaks.  Oh my my!  Who cared about the pain that came before, when these luscious slabs of tender beef showed up!  Can't even recall how good the garlic mashed potatoes or saauteed mushrooms were, they were so totally overshadowed by the great steaks.  We ate until it hurt and still had leftover  boxes to cart home.  Even the two men in our group couldn't finish their steaks.  Give it a try, just expect perfection in the meal because they could do no wrong there!  Yes, we recommend it and yes we are going to return!",

His name was Daniel, and he was so kind and compassionate.  He told us they would be happy to accommodate our request for pancakes for our son.   He then showed us to a small quiet room where our son would be less overwhelmed by the sensory issues associated with a large restaurant.  We had an amazing dinner !  Daniel made sure our entire experience was perfect.   As a family with a special little boy, many of the experiences we have usually consist of apologizing, and leaving a restaurant early as to not disturb other diners. It is rare to be able to go out to a nice restaurant with a child that has special needs, but also very important to teach social skills.  My son felt very special tonight, and had a wonderful time !  Because of Daniel and his staff, my faith in humanity is renewed once again.  Thank you so much!",

Order for drinks is in and we even get an appetizer ordered! 15 minutes for drinks to come to table and then 40 minutes for a spin dip That you've asked about twice since receiving drinks... Now nobody comes back for 45 minutes to take food order or give drink refills.. When the order comes out its wrong and we don't complain because who wants to wait for an additional 45 minutes to eat dinner. The topper.. sandwich comes out served with no bread because cook dropped the pizza bread on ground and now there's no more to offer... total joke was that when the manager comes to the table he has no idea how to deal with 6 aggrivated patrons. Get a real manager who knows how to schedule servers! Sad this is a nice place the NWest  needs this place and it's horrible. 3 times we've visited and each time the service was worse than the last. They need a rescue for sure.. We aren't in WY. We are in Las Vegas and we know what service is!!! Total dining time 4 hours! On a six top the corp should have had 2.5 tabkes in and out.. Fair warning local patrons!! I don't care how yummy the food was one time- poor management is a deal breaker..",

And then we waited, waited, waited. The server said they are making it fresh ... certainly hope so. I don't' expect to have eggs pre-made and waiting to be plated. We over heard the server saying that to other tables as well. The food was so-so. The eggs benedict was very disappointing. The hollandaise had no flavor and the English muffins were way too big and not all toasted. For waiting as long as we did, I would have expected a better meal. Tried it ... no reason to return. I honestly get a better breakfast at Denny's ...",

Cowboy themed decor without being the slightest bit cheesy was elegant without being stuffy.   Service is friendly and attentive.  Shelby, our server, is a star!  If the food wasn't enough to get us back, it could be on Shelby's personality and professionalism alone.  It's the people who tip scales and she's an incredible asset.    Okay, the FOOD. We came in for breakfast.  Prices are AWESOME.  More affordable than IHOP, with the quality of a great steak house who does breakfast right. I had steel cut oats and subbed fruit for the toast. Every element was on point, fresh and paid attention to detail.    My honey had the farmer's skillet... loaded with high quality meats, veggies and cheese. It was perfectly cooked.  We also split a biscuits and gravy. The gravy is sausage and loaded with sausage.  The biscuits are fluffy and scratch made.  I appreciate that!   We will definitely be back for breakfast... and look forward to trying the dinner menu soon.",

The bartenders were also great - awesome service, super nice. This is what made me be a loyal customer.  I walk in tonight, totally starving only to be met by one of my fave bartenders who delivered the bad news that the higher uppers decided to discontinue food service from 11pm-6am. What kind of moron made this decision?!?! You have one of the best late night menus in the whole valley for great prices and you think that we would keep coming here for beverages only without food to complement?!?!   This is such a terrible terrible decision - this is not going to gain any traffic and rather lose a tremendous amount of traffic because customers like me will no longer patronize this place until food is served again. This is what made a complete experience. I just shake my head as the great bartenders are no longer going to see regulars as much or even at all anymore without food service. You need to bring the food service back!!",

I got there I had to wait even though you can clearly see plenty of empty tables.  I was on a waitlist for 15 minutes then I got to my table and it was over 10 minutes without even being greeted. We just got up to leave ...telling them at the front that I was leaving because we never saw a server never greeted nothing .now this is a Friday night they should be staffed accordingly !  Their parking lot was packed but if they want to keep business in centennial hills area they need to step up their management and their servers.  Because one thing I've seen in the past as soon as another new restaurant comes along that offers better service they will steal their business away!  I know this because I've lived in centennial hills for 20 years.  Updating : 9/17/19  Since this review we have been in at least five more times between 3-7 p.m.  We have found if you sit in the bar area the high tops or around the bar itself you get better service! Then you do in the dining room!",

We started with the chicken fried steak bites and BBQ pork nachos, and both were very tasty.  From there, the entrees; NY Strip Steak, the Chimichurri Steak Sandwich, the Turkey Avocado Club, and the Scallops were all pretty good, however the scallops had a strong fishy smell and the steak was a bit over done.  Overall, Donald the waiter, did a good job, but there was a considerable delay between the apps and the entrees.  Many other tables nearby were done well before we had been served our meals.  Usually not an issue, but with small kids, it gets to be a pain.  Overall: good place for dining.",

The portions of food are amazing and the prices are very good. The atmosphere is very welcoming and there is a very nice layout.It felt very open and the food came out fast and fresh. Even their cioppino had amazing sized portions of sea food. If your looking for a good time and place to go and eat with friends or family 4:00 at FireRock is the place to be.",

With large portions for a low price you won't regret coming to FireRock.  --- Farmer's Skillet - 5/5 Stars - don't be fooled by the size of the skillet because this skillet is incredibly filling. It came with ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, green onions, mushrooms, and hash browns. You also get a choice to get a side of pancakes and some others that I can't recall.  --- Overall - 5/5 Stars - we received great service from *LaShaun* who checked up on us constantly and kept our drinks filled. He also provided us with their delicious warm bread that was warm and buttery. You'll definitely see a lot more check-ins from me in the upcoming future.",

Kids have their own individual kids menu, along with coloring page and crayons. Cons: Service is slow. Probably because staff are stretched out too thin across the entire restaurant. Our host never checked on us, even though we waited 30 minutes for a table. Our server Oni was incredible but we would have loved to see her appear more often at our table. We only saw her during drinks order, meal orders, and bill time. Shrimp definitely tasted like it came from frozen, and the loaded baked potato was just so-so.  All in all, we had a good time as a group. The food was good, but if we combined food + service + wait time, FireRock was not that memorable to me.",

We reserved a booth but were seated at a table and told it would be a much longer wait if we wanted a booth like we had reserved. We decided to stick with the table and move forward.   I ordered the Jalepeno Burger well done with mayo on the side. After seeing blood on the bun I cut it open to find a medium rare burger with mayo on both sides. The waitress offered to replace it and removed it from the check, but wasn't worth waiting another 30+mins when there was plenty of food on the table. Seemed to be a case of them being busier than they can handle.   Was a disappointing Friday night out!!!",

We waited almost 15 minutes before we asked the bus boy to please get us a server!  Finally a server came over and we asked for the manager. She was apologetic and offered to comp our meals. We are appreciative of her actions. If the service was consistent this place would be 5 stars hands down.",

Tons of mushrooms...salad was ok.  My salad was good, but seemed like they were pre-made,  loved they had \"French\" dressing My friend got the salmon, and the rolls were good.  But I must come back with a bigger appetite for a Filet, or ribeye steak!!.",

We had two Bloody Mary's, super tasty and nice spice, and found out they do unlimited mimosas and Bloody's for $15.00  (Brunch only).  Had a great server, Shelby.  Super nice, didn't over check, was there always at the right time.  Love FireRock for Happy Hours and now brunch.  Love our local joints!",

We made reservations, although they weren't really needed.   It was really nice inside, not what I expected from the exterior of the building which had the word GAMING in neon - which is always a no-thank you for us.   We were seated quickly and the waiter brought us water after writing his name on the paper on the table, M-I-K-E. We both got 'The Centennial' and a class of pinot noir, and the entire meal was heaven. The rosemary bread appetizer was enough to make us come back for more, we could have made an entire meal out of it alone! The steaks were perfect, the best flavor I've ever had, the baked potato and mac and cheese were ....well, a baked potato and mac and cheese - nothing special. ...but seriously the steak was absolutely phenomenal. I highly recommend heading over there. We also got a slice of cheese case each with our meals, which we took home because there was no way we could eat anymore.   I really enjoyed our time at FireRock. This isn't the type of place we would frequent, as it's a bit more upscale...but we'll definitely be back for more of that steak!",

Some pieces were chewy then others. Overall an F. We had the pork nachos. They were good but the chips, which I'm assuming they try to make themselves were below average. If they had a better chip they would be an A+. Overall the nachos were an C-. I had a Monty Cisco. It was terrible. Tasted like the oil was dirty, not cooked enough, for such a nice place you would think it would at least be quality turkey, but nope it was cafeteria dare I say subway quality meat. The waitress did offer me something else, which was the proper thing to do, but I declined. My wife had a burger it was giant and beautiful to the eye, she took 2 bites and boxed it. Said it had zero seasoning no taste. My biggest problem was we used a gift card which should have had a 200.00 balance on it. Now a lot of things could have happened, such as when they were handed out at her office they were somehow mixed up. Her doctor gave everyone at office a card and depending on how many people were in the family is how they received there card.  But when she talked with the manager, possibly the owner he treated her like she was trying to beat him out of 100.00. Very poor service at his end. Very disappointed and unimpressed.",

I had the white cheddar mashed potatoes & house salad which were great additions to the filet.   My husband had the Cajon ribeye, on recommendation of our bartender Alyson, which was cooked great & very flavorful. It wasn't overly seasoned & had the right amount of char.  We ended up eating at the bar because the restaurant was packed on this Friday night. It was the right amount of attentiveness & being able to take our time with dinner. We appreciated Alyson's knowledge of the bar as well as the food menu. We will definitely return! Just wish you were in Summerlin!",

Really you know how rude you are. 1st you said I ordered two much food, 10 wings. Then you said I should go on a diet... really. He said ya... I know you where going to say something again. Wow! I said. Yes but it really doesn't matter you don't see how rude you are. He laughed and walked away. I told the new manager when someone else was complaining. Oh the bartenders just ask regulars for oders before happy hour ends. So watch the clock and speak up. Hate the service but love the Wings.",

It wasn't the best steak I've ever had it was on the tough more dry side not the best cut but for 20 bucks you get what you pay for....the ceasar salad was dripping in dressing we couldn't even finish it was literally like eating fork fills of dressing...they separated or bills wrong twice until we finally just gave up and paid it for each other's meals it was too different...also had the Vanilla martini the waitress said it was the most popular she had to be lying because it was awful.

My steak was way overcooked (I ordered medium rare and it was borderline medium well to well) and cold and my wife's side (loaded sweet potato) was ice cold and hard in the center.

But things have taken a drastic turn. Now it's more fun to keep a running tally on the table with crayons with how many mess-ups one may encounter. Service is incredibly slow. Food is too salty. During our last visit with 8 people 3 meals needed to be sent back for being cold, hard, or just inedible. Missing items, constantly asking for bread and drinks, orders came to the wrong people.  The straw that broke the camel's back wasn't even having an incorrect bill which needed to be pointed out for the items sent back multiple times or for the items ordered but not received. The piece de resistance was the filthy tablecloth under the white paper. It looks like it hadn't been changed in weeks. Dirty food stains are never appetizing when diners sit down! See photos...",

Country Fried steak is NOT a breaded steak. It is cube steak breaded. My girlfriends eggs were like wet rubber. Her sausage links were cut open to make sure they where cooked right. Which they were not. Also, who runs out of pancakes at 9:40 in the morning???? Oh but they found some after we got our food. The server left the short stack in that bill that we had to ask to remove. Then, the new bill had a .09 tip on it. Really??? My GF left a $5 bill on the table. I said if the server put .09 on the bill I guess that is what she wanted for a tip. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",

    "text": "My wife and I, our son and his girl friend all went to try Fire Rock at about 6:00 on Friday night. We knew that it would be rush hour and expected the 20 minute wait time. They have a nice system where you give them your phone number and they text you when your table is ready. When we got seated, we were immediately greeted by Rick, our server and was served our drinks right away. We were ready to order and ordered right away. It was a busy Friday night and the noise level was off the chart. There was no fresh bread and had to wait about 15 minutes for it to come out of the oven. It was warm. soft and had a great flavor, About 15 minutes later the food came out and looked great! Sorry to say, the good review ends here.  The fish (and chips); fish had a good flavor but was a little rubbery.  The pasta bowl; my son refused to review this for yelp and I think it was because it was a little bland.  My wife had the dry rubbed ribs and baked potato. The ribs were dry and slightly tough. They had a nice smokey flavor, and the half rack proportion was generous. The potato was only cooked thoroughly on one side. and was hard and inedible on the other.   I had the chicken and biscuit w/ mashed potatoes. the flavor was kick ass and the potatoes were very tasty. The \"biscuit\" was a piece of toast(?) and certainly not a biscuit. That was disappointing.  One last thing, you would think that a a place that charges as much as $49 for an entree would have filtered tap water. The chlorine taste was unmistakable.  Unfortunately, it didn't end there. Our waiter was forced to wait on so many tables, it took 15 minutes to get our check. I felt bad for Rick and still left him my normal 20% tip. I will try this place again in a few months and see if it improves once they lose enough business to handle the rest.",

The host walked over to our table to hand us a menu since she could see we were not being helped, but still no one came to our table to let us know they were behind, or even ask for our drink order. Many times several different waiters walked by our table, and it was as if we were completely invisible. I know how tough serving can be and we are always really patient about it, but after our experience tonight, we are extremely disappointed.",

This was par for our service all night. She was great when she was there, but she was rarely there to fill our drinks or see if things were alright. I ordered the Real Bacon Burger with fresh cut chips and my wife ordered a steak.  Unfortunately everything that made it to our table was horribly bland except for the free rosemary bread. The burger was tasteless. The bacon jam was alright but there was such a small amount that it did not add any flavor to the burger. The chips were completely unseasoned. My wife's steak had no seasoning. It was cooked to temperature, but it had very little flavor.  With so many more-flavorful options in the area, we will not be returning.",

The restaurant on a week day was practically dead. Our waitress was friendly and my daughter ordered the chicken finger kids meal while I tried the Short rib pasta. We also got the Philly cheese steak egg rolls to start. The egg rolls were deliciously hearty and full of flavor. My daughter loved the 3 chicken fingers they gave her, very small portion even for a kid. As for the noodle dish I ordered, it was disappointing. The broth that subs as a sauce is very bland and the meat from the short ribs tastes more like a beef stew. I was looking more for that rich fatty flavor usually associated with short ribs. That flavor was boiled or stewed out of this dish. The noodles were ok, at least they weren't overcooked. The final nail in the coffin for this place was the length of time it took to get our check and pay for it. For a place that was clearly not busy at all, this is unacceptable. I waited 20 minutes to get my check and probably another 10 minutes waiting to get my card back. I was hoping I'd found a new fine dining option closer to home but this place did not cut it.",

    "text": "The service was AMAZING.  My waitress, Kahla (thank you, Management!! I wanted to give her credit but I couldn't remember her name!) was great.  I ordered the shrimp and strawberry salad, which was $12.99.  It came with three shrimp.  Three.  I'm not sure if the chef overcooked them or if the marinade was supposed to taste like brine.  I wasn't impressed.  The dressing was good but very sweet with the strawberries and the crusted walnuts, so became overly sweet.    The jalapeno burger was good, had a nice flavor, but not outstanding or remarkable.    The prices do not yet justify the food.  Three shrimp in a huge salad is not a shrimp and strawberry salad.  It's a walnut and strawberry salad with 3 shrimp thrown in that after eating I wish I hadn't.  The menu hasn't been developed yet enough to have any stand out items, and while the service is amazing, the food is lackluster and dull.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this new establishment. Upon arriving during late night happy hour (11pm-2am Monday-Sunday), front door was locked and didn't offer signage pointing to an alternative entrance through the south side of the establishment.   It is brand new to the Centennial Hills area. Great outdoor area for dining. Indoors is filled with tasteful cowboy memorabilia. The atmosphere is very inviting even from the bar. The background music left little to be desired. It was intermittently playing throughout our dining experience as though we were playing a game of musical chairs.   Late night happy hour menu is an abbreviated version of their full menu. Although, it is primarily a steakhouse, I would've loved to see some alternatives in the entree section such as seafood.  There are several drinks that are half off during this time. We did have to ask several times for clarity. Hopefully, they will create a menu with happy hour drinks.",

Not worth my time or money... sorry but it's the truth.     Only giving this an extra star for the service and creme brulee",

    "text": "Amazing!! Not only did we get service that was spot on and quick but she cared enough to give us background on how much time and effort is put into our food! We went during the soft opening and ordered the Oscar (7oz beef tenderloin with crab meat and bearnaise), you get to choose two sides (not including the asparagus already added) and I went with creamed spinach and lobster mac.  I'm going to do this breakdown per item.... The tenderloin we ordered to be cooked medium (the way I'm told the chef feels it's best served) it was really super! So tender, flavorful and cooked just right. There wasn't too much or too little bearnaise and it paired nicely together.  The creamed spinach I really enjoyed. Some places really take the \"cream\" to another level and it makes the spinach taste artificial. This one was fresh and the way I prefer creamed spinach executed.  The asparagus was also tasty... Sea salt, cracked pepper and olive oil. Perfect! The lobster mac..... HIGHLY recommended!! There was NO skimping on the lobster and I found huge chunks scattered throughout.  Not only was the Mac really good on its own but you could taste that the lobster had been cooked separately and was flavored on its own before being added. It really gave the dish the extra pizazz necessary for it to be the stand out for me. It was definitely the star! I should also mention, the bread they serve you before your meal was awesome as well. Reminded me a little of the sweet Hawaiian roles but bigger and with salt and pepper on top.  Overall..... I hope this place will be here for a very long time.  It's nice to have a steakhouse in the centennial area.....even nicer that this steakhouse serves happy hour daily with half off drink specials. How can I beat coming for a $3.50 Moscow mule?!?!",

    "text": "Sadly, the food at the new Fire Rock restaurant in NW Las Vegas doesn't live up to the beautiful decor. The number 1 complaint: the portions don't match the price.  Complaint number 2: side dishes are bigger than the main dish or don't measure up at all.   The restaurant needs to work out a lot of kinks if they want to survive.  In a town of all-you-can-eat buffets, where one can get their money's worth in a number of on- and off the strip eateries,  FR doesn't understand the importance of showcasing the good stuff, rather a carb overload of not 1 but two scoops of cold potatoes in their Mile High Tri Tip sandwhich. The sandwhich gets its 5 inch height  from the potatoes  (further carbed-out with a slice of Texas Toast on the bottom). Sadly the tri tip was cut too thick and wasn't tender at all. Not delicious, but reminded me of another large mound of potatoes from a familiar sci-fi movie.   Dish number 2 was the fish and chips, which for this diner was possibly the best fish ever to hit this land-locked city.  Unfortunately, the amount of fish was more like an appetizer portion, but the restaurant drowns out their fish by another cart of carbs with enough chips to feed a whale. The fish pieces were so small and only 3 were piled onto Old Bay french fries.  If FR would serve up a double portion of fish with half the portion of chips, that would be the best lunch and the best value for anyone in Vegas. Oddly, a very small portion of cole slaw (2 bites...no joke) was left to drip all over the other food on the plate.  FR should invest in ramekins...  Side salads (the healthy stuff) were way to small for anyone interested in a nice nutritious start to their meal.   Dish 3 was the fish sandwhich.  Delish, but again way too many fries and no cole slaw (even 2 bites would have been a nice companion on/next to the fish sandwhich.) They use the perfect roll and include a flavorful sauce which made up for some fry shortcomings.  Dessert was a diabetic disaster and to further the point about portions and price, the chocolate cake came with 2 scoops of ice cream and was more than these 3 diners could handle, but the price was less than the fish and chips?? The folks are really pushing the carbs at Fr.  Bottom line: give them a few weeks to figure it out and hopefully you'll be served a great main dish with a nice side.",

Seating is comfortable, table service nice. Servers are still getting the menu down as are the cooks. New openings sometimes take a few months to get all of the kinks worked out.  All in all, the food was good, service was standard. Not the best place in the centennial hills area but it is still young.

Sammy, our server was top notch. Great recommendations, good timing and clearly someone who wants you to have a great experience.   We tried the pork medallions and the beer can chicken. Both were quite unique which was fun to get off the beaten path at a steakhouse. Chicken was moist and cooked to perfection with that wonderful fat tire glaze. The maple and pecan medallions were tender with a very nice sweet and nutty flavor that tied together with the pork nicely.   Super yummy, out of the oven bread rolls had a hint of rosemary and just enough salt to mix with the butter and send you into a bread coma. Be careful not to go nuts on the bread, save yourself for the entree.   We're definitely coming back and I think I'll dive into the Ribeye next time.",

The salad wasn't anything special, the steak and potato were done just right and delicious, and I ordered the cream brulee (sp?) for desert, it wasn't what I expected. It was cold with a hard shell of sugar on top...not sure if that's what it was supposed to be. Hubby had the Cajun steak, which he very much enjoyed.   Overall, the experience was ok.

Other than that, we felt underwhelmed.   We did get seated quickly. Definite plus.   We started with the stuffed mushrooms; they were served warm and not hot; just ok. We both asked for cesar salads with our meals; no croutons, but the lettuce was super fresh so that was nice. My husband ordered a sirloin medium rare with shirmp, scampi style; he liked his dish citing not horrible. I ordered the chicken dijionaise; in my opinion was too salty, I did like the mashed potatoes though. I also ordered a pinapple martini, which the only pineapple-y part about it was the pineapple slice as garnish.   Overall, the most underwhelming part of our visit was our server.  Although she wasn't rude, she wasn't very personable either, no smiles, just very monotone.   Although the food wasnt horrible, the service wasnt horrible, it just wasnt that good or exciting so we dont feel like this is somewhere we need to return to any time soon. A bummer because we had high expectations of this restaurant based on hearing about it from family and friends.   Oh and the wall in our booth was dirty, with like splattered on food and/or drink that had dried on. Eww :(",

After a few months the service started going downhill.  Several \"another try\"s later and we vowed to call it quits with FireRock.  This was early last year when we decided this.  Well tonight we figured we would give FireRock one last try.  And that was our first mistake.  We got there and sat in the bar area at 9:45 pm.  We finally got tended to at 10:00 and we were given the late night menu and bread never came.  Is it served after 10?  Honestly don't know.  Fine ... we ordered the rib-eye.  It came out before the soup and salad so it went back.  Got the soup and salad ... both fine.  The ribeye came back a little more done than I like and the scalloped potatoes were a little burned.  My wife loved the rice.  We were comped my wife's old fashioned which I thought was a nice touch by the bartender who ended up serving us.  I just can't give more than 1 star due to my absolute disappointment.  I am not sure what is wrong with this former favorite place of mine but something is definitely broken.  Unfortunately we will never know if it's fixed ... unless we see \"Under new management\" on the front.",

First, they forgot our reservation, but it didn't really matter the place was dead.  Our drink and food orders were taken together and when our appetizers came I told my friend her tacos were different.  The server piped in that they changed their menu.  These were nasty and covered in cole slaw.  When our meal came they completely forgot one of my friends meal.  The server had the nerve to ask her if she had ordered food.  Seriously?  Then it was \"the last on the ticket\" then turned into \"the kitchen staff must have forgot\" to \"it's being rushed now\"  It would have just been fine if she just sucked it up and said she forgot to put the order in.  My food was cold and inedible,  husband's steak was overcooked, and we had to beg for refills.  This place was pretty good when they first opened.  After today I will never be back or tell anyone to spend their money here.  My friend without her lunch just wanted to let it go but I stopped to talk to the manager about how shitty the service was.  She didn't know, but then it's too late.  Management should know what is going on in their restaurant by making sure servers go to them when it's a colossal goof, not ask if a patron even ordered a meal in a place you go to order a meal.  Never again.",

I have tried to be patient and wait for them to get their act together but it's not happening. Their signature hot rolls were served after the entrees, not with our soup or salad.   My caesar salad was soggy iceberg lettuce with croutons and a water-down slightly caesar tasting dressing, followed by a terrible Chimichurri Steak Sandwich. Their version of chimichurri was unidentified wilted greens without any sauce qualities. The waitress asked how I wanted the steak cooked and their version of pink (medium) was chunks of meat cooked to death on a flat top or fryer. Our guest ordered a Turkey Avocado club which was served on dry bread, not toast with meat and veg just heaped on the bread topped by another piece of dry bread. This had no resemblance to a club sandwich. The when another glass of wine was ordered, the server reached over our guest and poured the new wine into her existing glass?? Our server was very pleasant, just not trained. I'm not comparing this to a real steakhouse, but I have had better food and service ant Denny's. Really too bad....",

The service this most recent time however....Jack ( our server) was super nice and personable but maybe overloaded? It's the easy things,  like coming around to ask if everything is ok with our drinks, food, would we like more bread... Justin ( the manager?) bought us a round of drinks because our glasses were empty and it had been a while since anyone came by to check on us. That right there goes a long way with me! Doing the right thing ( he didn't have to- but he did. Kudos!) The food was like it always is- DELICIOUS! Steak cooked perfectly. Everything perfect. But back to service... I was too stuffed for dessert... but I still expect the server to ask me if I want any...or a cup of coffee...not just \"here is the check\". Overall- yeah- I'm going back again and I recommend Firerock to others.  Just that they need to tighten up their servers. Customer service is free- you don't stock it in inventory- it doesn't go bad on the shelf - it makes the difference between this Steakhouse and say an outback.",

Extremely impressed and pleased that something is taking off in this location. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were great for the price. Also great prices on drinks.",

My husband insists on \"well done\" and other places can't get it right so far even his is right every time. Ordered the sirloin tonight and it tasted like filet mignon. The au gratin potatoes are a must try. No room for dessert tonight but tried their giant chocolate cake before and loved it. Will be back for sure.",

    "text": "A mixed bag here. The space is beautiful, warm and inviting. We dropped by around 3 pm on Sunday, no reservation. It was 3/4 empty so imagine our surprise to hear that there was a 10-15 minute wait for a table. The two young girls at the front desk were devoid of personality or professionalism. We were seated toward the back at a nice enough table. There was a larger table next to us that was empty but had the remains of a party of what appeared to be 4-5 adults and 3 kids. Their remains stayed on the table the whole time we were there. We were waited on quickly. Not being familiar with the red wines by the glass I asked our server for his recommendation. He said he didn't drink red wine, it gave him acid. Hmm, not sure I needed to know that. I ordered a glass of cab and it was good. As was my sirloin salad and my husband's ribeye, salad and baked potato. Well, the potato had a sizable black hunk on one end (gross) but was otherwise well cooked and tasty. I'd say the food was good enough and the service was fine. There are some management issues that need to be addressed. The prices are white table cloth, high end but the vibe is Outback or Applebee's. We will go back but probably not on a regular basis.",

We sat at a filthy table, waited 10 minutes for drinks. My Moscow Mule was ice and a lime garnish. Literally no liquid at all. The unapologetic server took it back to the bar to return by saying that they couldn't make a Moscow Mule anymore... I'm not sure if they ran out of vodka or lime juice. Either way, when I was charged for it on the receipt I wasn't happy. She came back a few minutes later and said \"I know,\" before I could explain the error. While I wasn't charged for the Stella draft I got instead; it was little consolation for the complete lack of apology for the entire experience for all the wait times, screw-ups and lack of service quality in general. Didn't get the server's name (not that it was all her fault), but regardless, we won't be back. Sorry for eating here. Good day, sir.",

    "text": "Tried this Restaurant on a suggestion from a friend.  Upon arrival, I was very pleased with the atmosphere and smell of the smoke flavor in the air from the grill. Even on an early Saturday evening, we were able to get in and seated pretty quickly.  The fresh bread they serve was Awesome!  Our Server was fairly quick to greet us and get our drinks coming, but after that it all starts to crumble like 10 year old croutons... we ordered the Street Tacos for an appetizer, I'm no expert on street tacos, but to be honest,  I've had better tacos at taco bell. I know.. it's a Steak and chop style Restaurant, but why put it on the menu if it doesn't fit in? Our server took our order, I asked what the soup of the day was, his reply was \" ummmmm I don't know, I just literally got here, I think it may be chicken tortilla or lemon chicken spice something?\" My reply was, \" if it's chicken tortilla, may I have that? If not? May I have the potato cheese? \" I never got an answer, just a quick swoop to the table with potato cheese and off.... guess it wasn't chicken tortilla??? My girlfriend ordered the Monte Cristo with no Mayo. After about 10 the server came by to inform us that they don't make that to order, they are pre made and they couldn't alter the sandwich.  She was reluctantly ok with it due to how long it had taken already to inform us of this issue.  About 10 minutes later we see a Monte Cristo sandwich go to a table who was seated after we were seated, and we jokingly said, \" she must have called ahead and ordered...\" when our order FINALLY came out, the tried to serve her a Chicken Sandwich..... after 5 more minutes go by.. our server tried to make light of it and stumbled and twisted his excuse, with, \" I had another lady order a Monte Cristo at the same time and I told the chef she wanted no mayo too, and he was confused and they stapled the wrong tickets together and it got all messed up, we're sorry. \" I wanted to agree out loud about them being \"SORRY \" I wasnt going to be rude or inconsiderate to my girlfriend,  so I offered my meal and or to share it with her. She felt the same way, and wanted me to eat and enjoy mine. Well.. no real gentlemen is going to eat while his girlfriend or wife sits waiting and sips her water... so I waited until hers arrived 15 minutes later. You could tell it was rushed and thrown together, even after several quick fly bys of our server, he could tell I was waiting on her food to arrive, he never offered to warm mine up, take mine back and bring fresh when hers arrived, nothing. .. we both were fed up with the poor service, quality and lack of knowledge they had for thier own menu, and was ready to leave. Damian, our server asks...\" would you care for some dessert? \" huh! Seriously? ! We didn't finish our meal because it was HORRIBLE!  not because we were full....! When the check finally arrived, yep.. you guessed it,  no apologies, no let me compensate you wit a dessert, no, let me get the Manager for you... nothing. To be fair, we never asked to speak to one, but in this case should we have to ask? Or is this normal service for them and I'm just asking for too much?... we won't not go back there even on a bet or a dare....",

I will say that the bread was delicious, and probably the best part of the meal.  Because this was a steakhouse I figured the Surf and Turf would be great.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The lobster was over cooked as was my steak that tasted of charcoal.  I had to ask for the butter that was supposed to come with the lobster and by the time it reached the table my lobster was cold, which made the over cooked issue even worse since it was now like rubber.  Presentation was also very poor.  I was there with a large group of people and my children were the only ones there, and they were served last!  I will not be back.",

    "text": "Well,,,, when you read reviews about horrible service, but choose to ignore them, giving benefit of the doubt, only to feel like fools for not heeding the warnings, and wasting your entire evening,,,,this is one of those warnings/reviews for that reason.  We will get the good over with, quickly, as was our first impression of this joint also over with, quickly..   Our server, Jesse or Jessie, seemed attentive and on top of her game, and the drinks came out in a reputable time, and were great, to boot....   I had the Dark and gloomy, she had the sangria......   Aaaaaaaaaaand that's where the good part ends.....    Oh, this is a table of two, before I forget to clarify for those of you who can't figure out that two drinks equals just that..  Normally, when you get your drinks, majority of servers take your food order.  Nope, not gonna happen on this trip.  She dropped off the drinks then disappeared for 10 minutes.  We then watched a table of four and a table of 8 get seated in our section, the table of 8 being our server's, the table of 4 being a different server's.     Our server then took the full order of the table of 8, then came by our table to ask if we were ready.  We placed our orders, steaks, of course, with the soup option, mushroom garlic soup for both of us, and we also expected that we would get some fresh bread, as was advertised as part of the meals on the menu.  At the same time, the table of 4 was having their order taken by their server.   The next 45 minutes of our evening became abundantly clear as a complete waste of our energy to walk in the door of this place..     We watched the two other tables receive food, be it their appetizers or soup/salad, or entrees, whatever, but food.   They got food,,,,, and service,,,, even from other members of the staff, they got food and service.  Even acknowledgement at their tables...  We got crickets.  Not a single person approached our empty table.  Multiple members of the staff were serving drinks and food, left and right, at these two tables, yet we were left hung out to dry.  Our server, Jesse, was not a part of the frenzy at the other tables, though, and we wondered if we were ever to see her again.   Upon the 45th minute, (or somewhere near it, but after that long, who's counting,,,), here comes Jesse....  And I quote, Jesse-\"can I get you another drink?\",,,,,  in my head thinking--\"(really,,,my drink is empty therefore it might occur to you that I could probably use another drink after you've disappeared for 45 minutes, yet you've failed to notice the white elephant on the table that is NO FRIGGING FOOD,,,NOT OUR SOUPS,,,NOT OUR BREAD,,, NOT EVEN OUR STEAKS!!) And my reply actually was \"yeah, and our soups!!\"  At which point startled her brain enough to remember we had actually ordered food and the look on her face was one of \"oh,, yeah,,, soups!\"  She then left, only to return 5 minutes later to inform us that, and I quote, \"the reason you haven't gotten your soup is because they are actually out of mushrooms for the mushroom soup, but we do have a chicken tortilla soup.\" Biting my tongue, (with many a choice word wanting to come out of my mouth on how we've been patiently waiting for our soups, the mushroom soups that apparently don't exist, yet as a server you fail to do your job, which relies heavily on communication, the most basic of task for a worker in the customer service area, you fail to inform us, over the last 45 minutes after placing our order, that you are indeed OUT OF MUSHROOM SOUP, and FAIL TO OFFER US ANOTHER OPTION UNTIL I BRING IT TO YOUR FEABLE MINDED ATTENTION THAT WE DO NOT HAVE OUR FRIGGIN SOUPS, or food in general, on our table,, which is your JOB,,,, FOOD, SERVING FOOD!!!).   My GF asks \"soooo, when were you going to tell us that you were out of soup?\"  And at this point, I've had it, and cut them both off and asked to get our check.  Jesse leaves, and 2 minutes later, a manager shows up with apologies.  I think he said his name was Chuck, but I was too irate to care to even listen, anymore.  He did ask us to give the place another chance, totally on him, my GF just expressed how disappointed we both were and that we were unsure that we would ever come back.  He offered again to comp us should we choose to come back, not likely on our part, though.   There's a reason that particular building keeps failing and business' go through that place like stuff through a goose, and this current operation is well on its way to continue that trend of failed attempts.....  We recommend going elsewhere, Echo and Rig, Ranch House, even Timbers will get you fed in a decent amount of time.... What a waste of our evening, complete customer service FAIL!",

Both came out hot and steamy, very flavorful.  Mine was super gooey with cheese; I'm also a gluten-free person and they made it without the bread.  Ron had the chicken fried steak and completely cleaned his plate.  I had the bbq pork nachos and didn't come close to finishing them.  The food came out hot and was yummy!!!!  We had a great time, thanks to Kahla!!!",

    "text": "Oh... Please clean your walls!! They are very gross when sitting at a booth!  So first time here. Was super excited about trying this place out after reading the reviews and seeing how pretty and nice this place looked.  Love how this place is decorated . It's so nice when you walk in and smells amazing. Our waiter was very nice , gave us an iPad with drink menu. I ordered the New York strip and he ordered the sirloin. The side salad was very delicious as was the baked potatoe.   As for the steaks, mine was really good, his however was not. Was cooked more toward the rare side when ordered medium well and his 10oz steak was mostly fat. He was very disappointed . He ended up eating the rest of mine and most of his steak that was fat was left on the plate. We did mention this to someone that wasn't the waiter that came by and asked how everything was. She said \"that's interesting\" and nothing was said or done about it again .   We came around 4:00. Dinner rush must have picked up because our on top of it waiter took a long time to get us our dessert and check. Dessert came at 5:15 and our check was finally delivered at 5:37.   The menu isn't accurate as it is a few dollars off, certain menu items say $21 or $22 but everything we got was charged at $23/each.  At first glance we were excited to come here again, but after the steak disappointment and the fact that they didn't do anything about it ...don't think we will be returning",

My family came here because usually it is an Ok place to eat, but this time the service, food, and manager (if you could believe it) where horrible. My son had steak, which he ordered medium well and was between medium to medium rare. They also forgot his soup (which ended up coming after his meal). On top of that, the fries that came with our meals didn't come out until after EVERYONE finished. The manager gave a \"free\" desert which we could share among ourselves and personally I was surprised it didn't say \"serves one\". Overall, I wanted to keep this place on my list but this experience was simply horrific.",

So I tried one with out the sause to see it the meat tasted frooze/microwaved, it had nice flavor and the dipping sause was great  The Ceasars salad was decent.   The 8oz bacon wrap filet was very good. The filet had just a hint of the bacon flavor which mixed well with the pepper. But sadly the side stole the show for me. That mac and cheese was amazing. It was real cheese  and something in it just made my mouth water. I had to share it will my whole table so they could see how great it was.   Then the icing on the cake is one of my favorite waitresses from another place walked in Danielle. She's such a bright personality. I am coming back for sure",

    "text": "7/12: 4.5 Stars We had great food and great service (from Jess). Probably one of the better restaurants in the NW. We tried it for lunch before venturing out for dinner. I had the turkey club with avocado and onion rings, my husband had prime rib dip with restaurant made chips. Both were 'standard restaurant menu items' but both were above average in taste.  The bread on my club it was fresh and soft and it wasn't just toasted, it was grilled in butter just like a club sandwich should be! The only downside was the Bloody Mary, which just tasted like bloody Mary mix with some big peppercorns in it and a lot of celery salt. No Worcestershire  sauce or Tabasco to spice it up a bit.   7/27: Another great experience at Fire Rock. We had some good appetizers, drinks & dinner.  The prime rib, firerock shrimp and baked potato soup were great. Our bartender,  Dave served our dinner & made awesome cocktails: the basil cucumber Martini and the Moscow Mule both were very well-made. We were surprised to walk in and see how crowded it was, considering that all of the venues that have been here before did not do well. Hoping that this one continues to be busy and stays around for a long time!!",

    "text": "The service from our waitress was awesome. The food was good. So why 3 stars you ask, a couple of issues. I ordered the bacon wrapped filet, with a baked potato and a side of mac and cheese. In the description it says each of the below listed items come with bread. So my steak came out and there was no bread nor was it wrapped in bacon and I didn't notice until I was half way done with my meal. The baked potato was good, it looked loaded with chives, cheese, bacon and sour cream but I was half way done with it and all the topping were gone, I recommend they really load the topping so the whole potato can partake in the mouth to stomach exercise.   Finally I felt like I was in between a casual hangout \"Country Western\" style place and a high class style restaurant. It was kinda an odd feeling. They put paper over the table cloths to write on and the menus are printed  kinda like I would expect at a bar/grill, but they bring the condiments out in small 2 or 4 oz little cup.. Not good if you really like to load on ketchup or mustard.  Will I be back? absolutely.. Next time I'll make sure to get the bread and bacon and double up on the toppings",

The food was not good, my burger had no seasoning and was raw in the middle. Fries were old and cold.  Here's the kicker....... I actually could hear the servers gossiping in the service station. What I over heard made me get up, pay my check and leave never to come back! They were talking about steaks in the back being dropped on the ground and then still served to a guest. I almost got sick as I just ate half a burger that wasn't even cooked correctly. I am not the person to send my food back or even negatively Yelp, but this was jaw dropping.",

It is a great place to go for casual dining with friends and yet have a really nice meal.  Returned this week & had another awesome experience!

I ordered a Moscow mule...pretty simple drink one would think, it took ten minutes to get due to the fact that she was flirting with the manager(he didn't seem to mind, with the smiles and touching he reciprocated) and the fact that she couldn't find any off the 2 ingredients to the drink. It was so disappointing for a new restaurant that looked do promising. Completely unprofessional atmosphere and disappointing..I think this place should reevaluate its staff..managers included.

Not sure if that's totally fair, but they're the ones who employed the server who knocked our love of FireRock down a notch.  First visit, about 3 weeks ago, for dinner: Server, Amanda, was nice and welcoming, we both got steaks that were perfectly prepared along with the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer. Everything was fabulous, left fat & happy.  Second visit, about 2 weeks ago, for dinner: Server, Amanda again, remembered us and was still efficient and pleasant. DH got another steak and I got the Mahi Piccata, along with the Seared Ahi appetizer. Everything was great, though the sauce on the appetizer was a bit overwhelming for me after a bit - would have preferred it on the side so I could have had a bit less on each bite. Still, we left fat & happy again.  Third visit, a couple days ago, for late lunch: Server; Dena, seriously wanted us to order the Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls, but we wanted the Crab Cake. She tried again, telling us that we only get ONE crab cake, we repeated our order. She left to put that order in while I was starting to give her the rest of my order. Oh well. Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls were delivered and refused. She took the rest of our order, Whiskey Burger and Beet Salad, and our Crab Cake was delivered. It was fine, but then Dena arrived and muttered \"told you that you should have ordered something else\". REALLY? Okay, fine.. food arrived, burger is monstrous and DH only ate half. Beet Salad was good for the first couple of bites but the ricotta/honey mixture got to be too much and scraped it off, then just plain couldn't take another bite of it.. just too much for me. We wanted our check, Dena was too busy chatting with the hostesses but eventually deigned to come to our table. Gave me the third degree as to why I hadn't eaten part of DH's burger. We left un-fulfilled and irritated by Dena.  Yes, we'll be back.. but if it turns out we're being seated in Dena's section, we WILL ask to be relocated. If we get Amanda's, we'll rejoice.",

It wasn't too crowded, but the service was still a little slow n the dining room. I ordered a 12oz sirloin, med rare, and it was too tough to eat. I sent it back and ordered a rib-eye; however, it was a little overcooked. Needless to say, given the prices, I was disappointed and won't be returning. I don't know how long this place will last, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it closed. Maybe the bar wiil keep the doors open, but time will tell.",

Hostesses at the front were welcoming as was the entire staff.  Was served by Kristin and she went above and beyond to be sure our needs were met. Never had a low drink or dirty plate on the table. When we were seated, I believe the table behind us had asked to speak to a manager. She quickly apologised and said she'd be right with us. And she was. She had a smile and warm attitude throughout our dining experience despite a busy evening for the restaurant. She knew the menu items and even offered suggestions.  The food was phenomenal. Our table sampled each other's plates and nothing was bad. I had a pasta dish that was a little bland in comparison to the rest of the table's delicious choices but it was far from being bad. The filet oscar my husband had was delicious!!! I will, for sure, be a frequent flyer here!",

We walked in to the restaurant today about 15 minutes after opening. There were 2 parties ahead of us and names were taken for all of us. 1st party seated and there were 2 parties of 2 people each left to seat.  We were both told the host person would be with us in a second. She took several place set ups with her under her arm (eeeewww) and walked off. Returns a moment later with the manager and tells all of us that she has to count tables and set ups and will be back then walks away. The manager laughs and tells all of us it will be worth the wait then proceeds to look at the tablet. Both my party and the other party waited 5 more minutes but the host person never returned nor did the manager ever seat any of us. After the wait and no word or attempt to seat diners, we walked out and the other couple did as well.  The restaurant was only a quarter to third full so I don't understand letting business walk out the door to count tables and set ups by both an employee and manager. Needless to say this location has been several other restaurants previously and closed, I predict the same for Fire Rock and deservedly so!",

I was very surprised how he reacted when I asked if Monica was there. He said Monica was no longer the manager. He seemed annoyed and walked away. I assumed he was the assistant and felt Monica would resolve the issue. Oh well, sorry to see her gone. Time to look for another steakhouse in the NW.

I requested to have a certain server and she wasn't very nice about it as she told me that she didnt know if that person would be working... (I would think if a customer is requesting a certain sever for a large party that the manager would advise that requested sever to make sure that it would work.) Today I get a call around 1115am from the same employee Brittany and she again was NOT the most pleasant person I have talked to... She was confirming the reservation and started rambling on about a deposit for a private room (never knew there was a private room or a deposit required) I tried to ask her to explain and all she said was \"if the room is avaliable then you shouldn't have a problem getting it.\"  It would be nice if when calling to confirm for a party that the person would sound like she cared and had some interest on what people are celebrating... Brittany a little advise you are in HOSPITALITY industry if you didnt know.

But the main reason for the 2 stars was the unbelievably unfriendly bartenders. There were two guys tonight that deserved 0-1 star but zero isn't an option. I know there was another bartender on a different side of the bar so not sure what his customer service is like but the two dark haired guys working the side of the bar that faces the same direction as the entrance were not interested in helping or acknowledging anyone that needed help unless you were seated and ordering from the bar, they looked quite annoyed by my simple request for sure!!!   The atmosphere is nice, like the variety of TV's in the bar area for the sports enthusiast are plentiful. Dining room is nicely set up.  Our server was very nice but prob needs a little more training or not such a large station as he was very forgetful with several things not just our appetizer.   Over all food is decent service is lacking  Feeling the two stars is pretty generous.  Maybe if we come back it'll be better and maybe the management will encourage their bartenders to be friendly to ALL the guests",

We got in the booth with its two big table supports. It was cramp and very uncomfortable. We ordered our meals. They used to bring you out some bread, we never got it. The steaks were only so-so.

The food is definitely not worth the price. The artichoke dip was Luke warm and the calamari is weird and tasteless.  The three stars are for 1. Available seating right away 2 the manager came over and asked how everything was. 3. The bread the bring out is amazing. Other than that we probably  won't be back for a very very long time. The last restaurant that was in there didn't do well and I hope the same thing doesn't happen to fire rock.  Such a disappointment.",

The second they put it down on the table you could smell the fish. This isn't right!  Last time he ordered his steak well done and it wasn't. He refuses to go back.  They started off strong but definitely are regressing. Also they took the best item off the menu - Tri Tip Sandwich!!!  We won't be back.   Went to Fire Rock a couple weeks ago to try the breakfast and they ran out of hash browns so we left. So disappointing...did Sunday morning catch you off guard??",

    "text": "This was our second time dining here and it'll definitely be our last.  My daughter picked this place out specifically for her birthday dinner last night.  Our tradition has been In n Out for years for bday dinners; however, she was insistent on going here.    I would give it one star, but the hostesses were very nice and got us to a table in about 10 minutes rather than the quoted 35.    My daughter excitedly told everyone it was her birthday.   Our server, Andrea I believe was scribbled on the table, rushed us to order.  She came back to the table three times asking, \"Are you ready to order yet...?\" It wasn't because we were taking forever to order by any means, she just didn't give us the time to even look at the menu.   I asked for a drink menu the first time, trying to find a fancy lemonade or something special for my daughter.  I asked if they could make a milkshake- it's not on the menu but they have ice cream so it seemed like a simple request and I was willing to pay extra.  She said no, wouldn't even ask the bartender. Just a flat out no. I asked if they had an special lemonades (strawberry or whatever like some places have). She said she could get my daughter a Sprite (how Sprite and lemonade are the same is beyond me...).    We ordered (a beer, a lemonade, ribs, and a wedge salad) and received our drinks but didn't see her for 30 or so minutes after that; someone else delivered our food.    She never asked if I wanted another drink.  I sat beerless for the whole meal :(   I would've asked for another by no one get came by the table.    I started eating my salad to find the lettuce was rotted.  When she finally stopped by I let her know.  She offered another but I told her no thanks and that I lost my appetite after seeing that.   My daughter ordered the ribs.  They were decent. Nothing special.  The fries were soggy and gross.   We hadn't seen the sever in a while, again, so I put my credit card on the table.  She finally grabbed it and came back, tossing to the card holder on the table. At least she told us to have a good night as she rushed away.    My daughter was extremely disappointed no one wished her a happy birthday.  I understand not all places do stuff for birthdays and I wasn't expecting anything out of it, but I feel it's at least nice for the server to recognize that we came there specifically for, what was supposed to be, a nice birthday dinner and all we got was crap service and rotted lettuce.",

Went back for my Birthday in Sept and there was a total break down in our order and between the staff. The staff were fighting amongst  them self, which was  spilling on to their customers.   Our meal was a Prime Rib with a Bake potato, a T Bone Streak with a Bake potato , a Grill Cheese and some fries, Steam Clams , soup and Salad with 2 Ice Teas with Lemon and Lime and a Chocolate milk!   The only thing good part of the meal was the Steam Clams and the Grill Cheese.   We asked to speak with the Manager, when she was able to come to our table before we started Conversation the Stress and Frustration was very clear on her face. She was very Kind in hearing us out and all she was able to say to us was, your meal is on the house and we will honor your Birthday gift from us.   The Waitress came back and asked if we got her into trouble for she needed her job then asked if we needed anything else, if not there's the door.  My hubby was so ready to ask for the manager again but I just wanted to leave!!!!!!  My Birthday on 09/17/2017 was by far the worse dinner yet.   I asked for the owner to call me at home he never did and he was never in.   I will not be back unless I'm in a private party in a private room. Using my Birthday certificate my hubby's birthday certificate and my senior citizen discount.   Yes still upset.",

I felt horrible for her because it was not a good dinner experience and I kept insisting we give them another try. From start to finish it took 2hrs and I'm pretty sure it would've been longer if I hadn't have flagged down the manager for our check. After eating our appetizer we seriously wanted to just pay for what we had ate and just leave but we stuck it out. Sure food was good but the feeling of being forgotten wasn't worth it. No exaggerating at all, people around us were canceling their orders and just leaving because they felt the same way. The last thing that I don't agree with is the rewards cards. We've been here many times and never once have seen a single reward, what's the point in a rewards card program with no rewards besides being told \"thanks for being a rewards member\"?  Will be canceling my rewards membership with the information on the back of the card, no need for FireRock to have my information and not provide any rewards. 19th check in's and never a reward, unfortunate.",

Pros: Appetizers-Chicken Lettuce Wraps,Fried Steak Bites, Artichoke Dip, The House Balsamic Dressing!! I am singing their praises- so tasty everyone at the table gets the salad. And the Rosemary yeast rolls!!!! Yummo!  Entree`-Bacon Wrapped Filet, Prime Rib, Maple Pork Medallions, Bourbon Pork Chops.  Sides- Asparagus ASPARAGUS!! Even my 2 year old loves their asparagus! Always flavorful and juicy! White Cheddar Mashed potatoes nice compliment to their dishes.      Dessert- Love the Creme Brulee,and the cheesecake is good too!  Cons: They are a great neighborhood steakhouse, but don't expect Smokehouse Ribs at a steakhouse..   Scalloped Potatoes- Not sure if its a change in Chefs but sometimes they are amazing and others, we send them back for the sweet potato :)  Dessert- I wish they had more options- The chocolate cake looks appealing to the eye but always leaves you missing something.  Service Contrary to other reviews, we've been in luck to have great servers! This last visit this week, I came to dine in with family coming straight from work. As a working and nursing mama I came with my breast milk in hand (wouldn't dare leave it in the sweltering Vegas heat) and one of the managers was kind enough to bring me ice and an insulated cup to keep it cool, while we ate!!   Rewards system: We like the weekly specials and use our card but I think they need to offer more card perks to the guests that frequent the establishment. Like coupons, $ off vouchers,  just more! lol  Overall: Thumbs up FireRock! We will be back, excited to try them for breakfast!",

    "text": "First time visit to FireRock and it was great. We went around 530 on a Friday with a party of five with no reservations and we were seated immediately. The atmosphere was a bit loud, mostly made up of conversation, but was casual and warm. You get the sense that this is a nice place, but without all the fancy nonsense. Where things like the silverware and place settings seem average, the food is really good. I think the menu could be simpler, but my family and I were able to find several choices that we were interested in trying. I thought the prices were reasonable, the staff was friendly and attentive, and I never felt under dressed or out of place, even with 2 small children. Thumbs up for reasonable drink prices and excellent kids meal prices. We signed up for the frequent diners card because I feel we will actually be back soon. Thanks.",

Other times the meat is burned, not charred, burned and the plating looks like someone tossed the salad from the other side of the room and sometimes you're lucky to catch the server's attention much less order. This place isn't cheap and the decor is welcoming enough, but that's not enough for me to pony up anymore money when I can do just as well at the local Denny's for much less moola.",

    "text": "I ordered an Aqua Pana water and our server presented it to me with ice. The same ice that comes from Lake Mead that I was trying to avoid in the first place. My husband ordered Ginger Ale and our server (who took our drink order) mistakenly poured tap water into his half-filled glass. We told him that was soda and he said okay. I spoke up and asked for a new Ginger Ale. By the way, he never removed the contaminated glass.  Next, I ordered a simple Caesar salad and he complicated that. He asked if I wanted a regular salad with Caesar dressing or a Caesar salad with Ranch? I just wanted a Caesar salad - nothing fancy. I probably should have left at that point, but apparently I'm a glutton for punishment.  The French onion soup was good, according to my husband. Our chicken fried steak bites were spicy, but tasty. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were excellent. Sadly, they don't believe in clearing your plates after each course. I then decided to get our leftover appetizers boxed up in hopes of freeing up space on the table. Granted, I've never been a server, but this is just common sense.   The steaks were supposed to be well done (meaning no pink according to their menu). I was the first to discover that my steak was red inside.  At this point, I asked for the manager. I probably should have asked for the check. Instead, I gave them the opportunity to right their wrongs. This resulted in the manager giving us a new server named Maria, who was a doll! My steak appeared to be microwaved and was super rubbery. Naturally, I boxed it up for my doggie. Now, my husband received an undercooked steak too. Maria gave him a new steak altogether and it was juicy, but he received it 15 minutes after my food was served. For the inconvenience of everything, the manager gave us a piece of dry chocolate cake. Needless to say, I WON'T BE BACK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!  And this is why you spend $100+ per person at an elegant steakhouse and not $22.95 at some rink-a-dink steak place.",

    "text": "I was intrigued after reading about their infused vodkas and homemade sangria. I recall being here a long time ago when it was Roadrunner.  My first visit to FireRock was on a Wednesday evening, and the bar had a small crowd. I did have a lovely glass of their sangria, which is pretty awesome! It's a nice enough place, with (smoke free!) gaming at the bar. I've also tried the stuffed mushrooms ($7.50 at happy hour), which were good but a bit mushy. I recommend a martini with one of their infused vodkas. The vanilla/lemon was very tasty and smooth!   The patio area is nice and underutilized from what I saw! The decor inside is western-y, with a modern twist, and it has lots of light. Not the easiest place to get into by any means, as it's near a busy intersection. They have plenty of parking, it's just an awkward area. That drops it down the list a bit for me, as I very much prefer easy in, easy out parking. There are limited choices in the area for steakhouses, and though this one is part of a 2 location chain, it doesn't have much of a corporate vibe. Promising!",

    "text": "We've been to the FireRock Steakhouse on several occasions, usually for special occasions. The restaurant is nicely decorated...very upscale and elegant. The clientele is often sharply dressed...not many \"jeans and t-shirt\" types.  As far as the food is concerned, the menu is quite varied, in both selections and price. One can order a sandwich in the $11 range, or twin lobster tails for $49, and the quality of the food is excellent.  The server that we had during our most recent visit was \"Shelly\". She was awesome...professional, friendly, personable, and efficient...refilling our water quite frequently and making sure that everything was good.  The bread that they initially serve you is hot, fresh, and \"fluffy\"...with a hint of rosemary. It's served in its baking pan, along with whipped butter, and it's is quite delicious.  Unfortunately, our visit was almost derailed due to an unnecessarily long wait for a table. We arrived with a party of five and waited several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us. Employees were passing by, restocking menus, and it didn't seem like anyone noticed that we were there.  Anyway, we were told that it would be 8-10 minutes before we could be seated. They said they needed to just \"clean off a table\".  Well, that 8-10 minutes turned into well over 20 minutes...and the thing is, the restaurant was practically EMPTY (a Sunday afternoon at 5:00pm). There was no \"it'll just be a few more minutes\" or \"sorry for the delay\"...just the front staff going about their business.  I'm not sure if this place has issues seating parties of five, since we saw a few couples and parties of three and four without reservations seated immediately (maybe, they want to specifically use tables designed for parties of 5, rather than giving out a table for 6 or adding a chair to the end of a table for 4).  By this point, I was ready to simply walk out without explanation (if there's one thing I will NOT put up with, it's being ignored or waiting a longer period than originally told...that sort of thing totally ruins my appetite and makes me not want to give a place my business).  The host gave some other lame excuse that they were waiting for the people at our table to leave (even though there were plenty of other tables available and we were initially told that they were already bussing the table).  Anyway, I've read other reviews that have mentioned the unnecessarily long wait times. I don't know if it's a training thing or if their business model is based on making people wait but, if it continues, people won't be coming back.  At least, the food was good.",

My friend and I came in for lunch, we were seated promptly and the place itself was empty save for a couple tables.   Our waitress was nice, she seemed attentive at first but then that stopped. We ordered two appetizers, the lettuce wraps and the calamari. The lettuce wraps were 75% sprouts and carrots then 25% of the chicken mixture. The calamari was the smallest portion I've ever seen served of fried calamari for $8.95, but it was very tender and the waitress was awesome with getting us different dipping sauces because my friend couldn't eat their spicy sauce it came with.  For lunch my friend ordered the fish tacos and the baked potato soup. The soup had twigs? in it, inedible pieces. It's like they didn't strain it. The fish tacos looked really good, nice and crispy but were SUPER bland, no taste. She had to salt them three times to get any flavor out of them. The coleslaw (which she had put on the side) wasn't even dressed so it was just a side of shredded cabbage. The macaroni and cheese she ordered as her side was just as bland, no flavor and it was an extra $1.50 charge.  I decided on the chicken fried steak. The gravy was really tasty and the actual chicken fried steak was tender and crispy so I was pretty happy with that, very good. The sides of mashed potatoes and corn were... weird. The mashed potatoes were tasteless. It was like they boiled potatoes, mashed them, then forgot to add the other ingredients. The corn just tasted off, so I didn't have a second bite.  I ran out of water half way through eating and put my glass by the end of the table. By the time we were done and waiting for awhile on the check with no water refill the manager/owner came over and apologized saying our waitress was very busy. So she ended up getting everything for us. While leaving we made note that there were only four to five other tables occupied in the dining room. Kind of frustrating, but hey maybe she was new.",

Not only did he make me a custom drink he was awesome at engaging in conversation and making sure I felt special plus he recommended the prime dip which is so so good ....  When my friend showed up we ended up having a debate about DC films and Ace came to the rescue even though he didn't have my section and yet another awesome on the eyes with nice accent guy   So any ladies i definitely recommend you sit at the bar .. even tho the waitresses seem nice !  I also go to speak to some of the other staff before my friend arrived and sadly I didn't get their names but they were great!  Awesome experience and good food!  This place has a great happy hour!",

Called the server an she totally agreed. the server took it to management and the chef they both agreed the crab was bad.  As a courtesy they said they would not charge us for that dish,.  Seriously?  Are you saying you were going to have me pay for bad food?  No sign of management nor apologies from management or anything beyond that too express their concern or correct the situation.  Will not be returning bit will spread the word!!",

    "text": "I have been a couple of times now and I definitely have some favorites and some not so favorites. I love the seating options nice booths tucked away for privacy, but a large bar area with high top tables and TV's for a more casual experience. The bar is well stocked and the drink prices are very reasonable. My favorite on the appetizer menu is the seared ahi tuna and the firecracker shrimp. The chicken cobb salad was also very good. I must tell you the complimentary bread is absolutely dreamy!!! So buttery soft with a touch of sea salt on top. I can't ever manage to get pictures of the full pan because I have to eat a piece the second it is set on the table. I was extremely impressed with the quality and the quantity of the alaskan king crab legs. Portion is a full pound and a half, quality was excellent, very sweet, and the price was very reasonable. I personally prefer the rigatoni bolognese over the short rib ragout, but that is just my personal opinion. The flavor in the bolognese exceeds that of the short rib ragout, but if you like a lot of meat in the sauce the ragout wins. I also like the chicken fried steak, very well prepared, nice crispy breeading and not tough or dry on the inside. The  gravy was a perfect compliment and not overwhelming, sides of course,  mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. My husband had the rack of lamb and he had no complaints, and again portions are huge.  Lots of leftovers for the next day.",

Dinner: food is fantastic once it gets there. Steak special has always been cooked perfectly to my liking.  Sunday brunch: seriously, what happened??? A few months ago the pancakes were thick and fluffy, this morning they were thin and mushy. 2 meals were forgotten completely. The \"extra crispy bacon\" was nearly raw. Will never bother to have breakfast there again. Complete waste of time and money. Bottomless bloody Mary special: several people partook. Every single drink came out completely different. Some good, some terrible, zero consistency.",

    "text": "My fiance and I loved FireRock! We would go there occasionally and didn't mind the prices because the food was worth it. But it seems the food quality has gone down tremendously. My lobster was over cooked , fiance had Cajun ribeye which was very oily and not so melt in your mouth any more and not as thick as we remember it. Steak fries had a lot of oil under the fries which made the bottom layer of fries soggy. The sangria recipe seems to be different, I would drink at least 2 or 3 while we were there but this time I had to force myself to finish the one, maybe the alcohol got switched up but I could taste the difference.  The lobster Mac and cheese was very liquidy but you wouldn't know it from the hard shell of bread crumbs and baked cheese at the top. It was my fiance's birthday and since we haven't been to FireRock in a while we decided to go there. We hyped ourselves up and practically starved because we didn't wanna ruin our appetite. We did leave there disappointed and I felt really bad because I knew that it wasn't the birthday dinner he imagined and I knew he didn't enjoy it quite as much as previous times.   The service was ok, I do miss the other servers that used to work there or maybe still do but were off that night. They would be just slightly more bubbly. My children had to wait a while for a refill and the server barely checked in on us and then did so once after we got our food. The server assistants did not look happy at all! In my short stint of working at FireRock as a server assistant, I was told to smile at all times when on the floor, which came pretty easy for me, even though the job was pretty hateable.   Basically, we probably won't be back for a long time if at all.",

Our bill all 3 times has been cheaper than similar breakfasts at nearby IHOP, Montana Grill and Mimi's.      Looking for a different place to breakfast Sunday morning, we decided to give FireRock a shot over our customary Montana Grill or Mimi's.  FireRock delivered, with excellent wait service and on-the-spot coffee refills.  The oatmeal breakfast had plenty of raisins, brown sugar and pecans, plus milk.  It was plentiful & filling.  The blueberry waffle combo came with plenty of compote. The accompanying scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon were well-prepared and tasty.  The waffle came golden brown and perfectly cooked.  We totally enjoyed our experience and plan on a return visit.  The steak and eggs I observed while leaving looked tasty.  The only item not on the menu I would like to have seen is crepes, but there are other items I'm interested in.  I appreciate the inclusion on the menu of half-order French toast and biscuits and gravy too.",

We watched people come and go, as we waited for our food. It took over an hour to get our main course. My steak, which was suppose to be rare, looked like it sat under the heat light too long, and by the time I got it, it was medium.  When we received our separate checks, they were wrong to. All of our orders were messed up. When I brought this to the attention of our server, Toni, she said she was aware of the problem and wasn't paying attention when she was separating our checks. When I tried to tell her what we had, she interrupted me, and said she knows what we had. Well if you knew then why didn't you do it right in the first place. The server, Toni, was borderline argumentative. It will be a long time, if ever we return to Firerock.",

To start, we ordered sangrias, and they were tasty.  We also ate their free homemade rolls (to die for - soft, warm, and squishy...mmm).  For our meal, my husband and I ordered burgers.  Janet educated us on how FireRock makes their own burgers with the steak meat that can't be used for the steaks.  I must say, they were the absolute best burgers we have ever had.  After our sangrias, breads, and burgers, we could not possibly order dessert, so I can't comment on that, but everything else was ON POINT!!  Keep up the good work!

It's been a number of places that fell flat, but from the continuous flow of people this neighbor gathering spot looks like they're going to make it. Loved the fireplace near wrap around bar. The Well Drinks (rum and coke) were$2.75 and Martini $6 - holy smokes that's unheard of in Vegas. Great selection and delicious tasting appetizers. Bartender David just kept drinks coming. He was fun and on top of our party of 8. Can't comment on the dining room experience, except it was crowded and people still being seating after 8 PM. This is a refreshing fun, vibrant bar to meet up with friends. Not a big fan of BJs down the street so this place fills the social hole we've been looking for. Thank you FireRock!",

The tomatoe and basil pasta was drowning in oil.  very unhealthy, and I kid you not about 1.5 cm of oil at bottom of the bowl.    The pistachio bass -  again very oily, and bass was farm raised.  The steaks on the menu -  might as well go to Echo Rig at Tivoli as its the same price, and guarantee Echo and Rig will be be better.    Average.  If you go here, think of Olive Garden or Chilis.",

    "text": "Great location, comfortable casual environment with Great prices.  We sat at the bar on a busy Friday night. We both ordered a Bloody Mary with extra vegetables. We received a watered down, canned, mix drink with 2 olives. We must be spoiled, as we are used to carrots, celery, olives and a super rich, spicy made to order type drink. This Bloody Mary tasted like something you order from a can while flying a budget airline.  We both ordered entrees that included soup or salad. The waitress took our order and never mentioned the soup or salad. When we called it to her attention she agreed that it was part of the entree price but said it was only given if you specifically asked for it.. So odd as that is part of the meal you are paying for. The chicken I ordered was ok, plated on top of a small serving of mashed potatoes and looked a bit institutional to me.  Nothing appeared fresh or high quality and was more of a low end presentation. The salad, soup and bread are all part of the entree price but will only be served if you specifically request it which seems sneaky and cheap to me.  This place should raise their prices a tad and offer better quality food and service. We love the location and would pay a bit more for higher quality.",

    "text": "Bizarre experience.  First, we called around 3:15pm on Saturday to make a reservation for 4 for 7pm. Was told they do not take reservations between 4pm and 8pm (which seems a little strange since that would be the busy time when you would think that they would WANT reservations, but okay). But, they did tell me that we could call back about an hour before we wanted to dine and they would put us on the list. So that's what we did.  Called at 6:45 (three times before they answered) and asked to be placed on the waiting list. They took my name and then we received a text that we were on the list. Convenient. Received another text saying that our table would be ready soon so we left where we were (approx 15 mins away) to head that way. Got there and was told that our table was being prepared. We still had a probably 15-20 minute wait and then when we were being seated they gave us a table right next to the bar. I asked if we could have a booth (probably 3 or 4 were open) and she told me they were \"reserved\". I said I didn't know tables could be reserved since we tried and she responded with \"well, we normally don't take reservations unless you know the manager or something\". Ummm, okay. Way to make us feel SUPER unimportant.  So, we sat at the bad table and the bread came out. Looked great, smelled great. The problem was we had no silverware. We waited. And waited. We even tried to call over other servers. Nothing. My husband finally had to go up to the bar to get place settings but by then the bread was cold.   We had ordered salads with our entrees and my husband's came out with no dressing and again we had to flag someone down. When the food came out it was decent but we were never checked on often.  Here's where everything gets weird.  Because we were made to feel so unimportant when we got there, and made to feel like we really needed to \"know\" a manager, we wanted to speak with one. So, one of the people with us stopped someone and asked if they were the manager. The response was \"I'm one of them\". Great. Perfect.  I told him that I just wanted to meet him because apparently that's what we had to do to get a booth since that's what the hostess told us. His response? \"Well that's not the case and I'll be sure to punch her in the throat right now\"....Uhhhh, not what I wanted. At all. No violence needed.  My husband went on to tell him about the salad and he then said he was going to \"stab the chef in the neck\". I mean, at this point it's a little comedic but what manager actually says that!?!? We watch him walk over to the hostess stand and start talking to the hostess standing there (not the one who sat us) and I'm mortified. We're about to leave anyway so we walk over and tell him that's not who sat us and he said \"oh, was it the one with the frizzy hair? (referencing the only black hostess who sat us)...mortified again. He then went on to tell us (literally) that she had \"said other stupid shit today\". Really? At this point we just had to leave and try and laugh it off, although in the back of all of our minds we were honestly all hoping that we wouldn't wake up to awful news of murders at Fire Rock. We had to end the night across the street because we all needed a drink after this experience.  It's a shame...the food was really quite good but we will NEVER be back because the staff was SO horrific.",

    "text": "This place is fantastic. Great atmosphere and the food is very tasty with very reasonable prices. The food seemed to take a little bit longer than I had anticipated, but it was very, very good. Definitely recommend!  UPDATE: We had such a good experience the first time we went, we decided to go again a couple days later. Unfortunately, this experience was not quite as uplifting as the first one. We arrived at the restaurant at about 5:15 PM, and we were seated immediately. The server came over and got our drinks a few minutes later and everything seemed to be fine. Unfortunately that's where it started to go downhill. We eventually ordered some hors d'oeuvres and it took 30 minutes to get our them after we had ordered. Then when we order our food it took another 30 minutes to get the pre-dinner salad, and then another 20 minutes to get the food itself. When we got our food, it tasted fantastic. Unfortunately, when we got there at 5:15 PM we didn't finally get out of there until almost 7:30 PM. The server had come up a few times and apologized for how long everything was taking, but apologies only get so far before the frustration really start to set in. We had three kids with us and it was difficult to keep them entertained the entire time. The most concerning part of the visit was that there was a table behind us that had arrived before us but had not received their food by the time we had received our food, and we had heard the server for that table apologized more than once for how long it was taking. The couple at the table were clearly upset when we were leaving and they were just receiving their food. The food and the atmosphere were incredible, and I would love to go back there, but as it stands right now I don't feel that I would go back there just because it takes so long to get the food. As I was talking to one of my friends about this he said he had a similar experience and it took him over three hours to get out of the restaurant.  In conclusion, I would give the atmosphere, the politeness of the staff, and the food five stars. Regrettably, though, the fact that it took so long for us to get our food and get out of the restaurant warranted a one star. If you have the time, I would highly recommend going and trying this place out. But, don't go there hungry just in case it does take a long time for the service to pan out.",

    "text": "This was our first time here and were excited for a new steakhouse in the Northwest part of town. We made reservations for 5:30 and were promptly seated. It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to take a drink order. We were disappointed that they were already out of calamari so we ordered the fire shrimp. The quantity was nice, but was a bit too citrus flavored and lacked spice. The wedge salad was decent size and tasted good. The crab cake was large but we would not order it again as it too was citrus flavored. The filet oscar was large but the bernaise was lacking. The crab was a tad overcooked. The steak did have good flavor and was cooked perfectly to medium.  The white cheddar mashed potatos were plain with no flavor and had a gritty texture. The best parts of the meal were the lobster mac n cheese. It was very large with plenty of lobster and noodles. Very rich and great flavor. The homemade bread was outstanding. My daughter ordered the chicken alfredo. It lacked sauce, but was a large portion. My son ordered the mini corn dogs. He thought they were very good, but he is not a fan of big steak fries.   With this being a recently opened business, we hope that in time they work out the issues with the menu. Their bappy hour menu looks appealing and we will be returning soon to try it.  Our waiter was very friendly and quick to fill our requests. The restaurant is large with booths,  and square tables. It looks as though it can accomadete larger groups and has a private room. There is also outside seating.",

    "text": "I hate writing terrible reviews but I was so disappointed with this place I had to make it known. Being in the service industry myself I was appalled at how they conduct service.  There were six of us total, four of us showed up early (about 615pm) for our 630 pm reservation. We were told we would get sat closer to our reservation, which was no problem at all we were still waiting for two more and it was busy. As it approached 630 we had not heard a word about being sat, at around 640 we checked in with the hostess just to make sure we were still on track to get seated, she told us they were waiting for tables to get up.. ok like I said they were busy. At about 650 we were ready to just sit, I went up to the hostess and let her know we had a 630 reservation and asked how much longer it would be, she then said oh just a few more minutes, attitude from both hostesses by the way. Why even make a reservation? So we finally get sat around 7, 30 mins after our reservation time.  It took the server about 15 more minutes to come and greet us, at that time we had already decided what we wanted tot eat and just wanted to order. She took our drink orders, took about another 15 minutes to bring them back and then said ill be right back to take your order. We had already been sat for about 30 minutes and just wanted to order! Finally we were able to place our orders, all 6 of us ordered some type of meat. We had an appetizer and the soups and salads came out which were all tasty. Finally when our food came out, about 35 minutes later, one of the orders was wrong, she had ordered a bacon wrapped filet and got a NY strip... seriously? They are not even the same cut of meat, the server took forever to come back to even check on us for us to tell her it was the wrong order. She immediately took it back and said her meal would be right out. The manger did a table touch and assured us he would take care of the meal and it would be right out. Well both of those things were a lie, it took about 20 mins for her correct meal to come back out, while all of us were done eating. In the midst of this problem, my boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb medium. It was RAW, i like rare things and I wouldn't have even eaten that. We did not want to wait for it to be fixed and he was so annoyed he just ate what he could and took the rest home to cook himself later. My NY strip was way overcooked and I noticed everyone else meat was undercooked. I ordered my steak Oscar style and got maybe a bite full of crab, barely any bernaise sauce. I wish I would have taken pictures but I was honestly so irritated.   After everything is said and done, the check comes, mind you not cheap. The mistake wasn't even taken off! We asked the server about it and she said, it was on the bottom of the check.. It was a $15 discount when her plate costed over $30.. Im not one to expect free things, but do not tell us you are taking care of the meal and apply a small discount. Thankfully the company we had at dinner made up or the horrendous meal.   Probably the worst service Ive had in a long time, I get it restaurants get busy but alls we ask for is a little communication. Not even worth giving this place a second try on a slower night.",

Drinks for the kids and myself were seldomly refilled, waitress only brought 4 rolls for a table of 5 and when one of the waitresses did bring out a drink refill, she strangely stood behind me saying \"Excuse Me!\" rather abruptly. Took me a minute to even realize she was talking to me. I will continue to visit Firerock (until the quality of food declines) however, I would recommend that management take time to better train their waitstaff or even hire more friendly people.",

    "text": "It might just be me, but when you step into FireRock, it feels like you're literally walking into the one and only Shenanigans. This place has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feeling down to a science. From the cheesy decor trying to look like an upscale steakhouse, to the terrible service from waiters who obviously don't want to be there, and the mediocre and overpriced food, it's like you're on the set of a movie...  We sat down here for dinner this past Sunday night at around 5:30. With it being fairly new to an area with otherwise almost no good restaurants, I thought it would be much busier than it was. After all was said and done, I could see why it wasn't. Honestly, it's surprising to me that people would come here more than once, but I guess that's what keeps all these chain restaurants alive and kicking.  When it comes to the menu here, it looks small at first, but has a whole bunch of options. I just really don't get those options. FireRock Steakhouse is supposed to specialize in steaks (it's in their name), yet they only have a few cuts of meats...with the rest of the menu having everything from street tacos to a monte cristo. Maybe the concept is just over my head, but their menu literally has about a quarter of a page featuring steaks, and that's it.  Because it is a steakhouse, of course I wanted to try their steak. I ended up deciding on the Cajun-Spiced Ribeye, which for whatever reason is $2 more than their regular ribeye. The only difference it it's supposed to have cajun spices, which I think to them only means cayenne and paprika, and then some \"Creole Butter\". I'm almost positive they just use the exact stuff sold in a jar that goes by that name, and that's where they are getting the $2 up-charge from. You might have guessed it by now, but this steak was nowhere near worth it's $26 price tag. I requested it medium-rare and it was overcooked. Very little marbling in the meat, not much fat or flavor, and a really thin cut. You can see from my picture that there was virtually no juice from the meat on the plate, and it stayed that way even after being cut into. Any juicy was likely from the jarred Creole Butter anyway.  What made FireRock even worse is the service. I realize they are still pretty new, but they've been open almost 2 months now. You'd think they'd have a good amount of the kinks worked out, but that just isn't the case. Our waiter looked like he was in hell, and every time he'd fill a drink cup, he'd slam the cup on the table like he was taking out his aggression on my poor iced tea. I'd say thank you, he'd walk away without saying a word. We had to ask for things more than once, and just to get some bread took 10 minutes. He just didn't really seem to care to be there at all.  And while maybe not directly his fault, our salads took almost 30 minutes to come out, with our main entrees taking just over an hour. With our small party of 6, and the restaurant pretty slow overall, it shouldn't have taken nearly that long. To add fuel to the fire, my wife ordered a filet cooked medium, yet it came out much closer to medium-rare and was basically cold to the touch.  As I said, I'm not sure what FireRock is going for. A menu that's all over the place with crap service and mediocre, overpriced food is a recipe for disaster. The good thing they have going for them is they are maybe 1/2 a step-up from an Outback, and are surrounded by other crappy restaurants. For people who constantly frequent mediocre chain restaurants, this might be a welcome addition...for everyone else, methinks not. \"Eat somewhere else, enjoy your food\".",

This was our second visit, first was not a bad experience.  My wife ordered an $18 shrimp dish with what she was told would be creamy mashed potatoes. Shrimp were over cooked and the potatoes were lumpy.  Not only would I never order this again we will not be back.  And the service..... Below par. Brought us bread with no plates or napkins, iced tea without asking if I would like any sugar or sweetener.  Absolute waste of an evening at dinn",

    "text": "I've been waiting to try this restaurant for a while now and have been really looking forward to it. Called for Thursday 6pm reservations, was told they have a \"wait list\" they can add me to, but don't take reservations? Odd, but ok. I immediately received a text saying we've been added. Cool stuff. We arrived and had about a 5 minute wait for out table. The restaurant has a great vibe, nice decorations and you can smell the wood fires. Really liking this place!   Soon after we sat, we realized this place has serious issues. We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to bring water, ask for drinks etc. I saw several servers running like headless chickens. I also saw what I think were 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing like they didn't have a worry in the world.   The menu is great, lots of great choices.  I really wanted to try several items.  We ordered finally and got a pan of great bread dropped on the table. Waited another 5 minutes and finally called someone over so we could get silverware and napkins.  At least something to spread butter with. Things aren't looking good.  Our waiter came finally and took our order. We then sat there for 35 minutes before seeing him again before our dinners arrived. Now we're so agitated it doesn't matter if the food is great or not. We've been here going on an hour still waiting...on a Thursday!   Got our dinners, finished them, waited another 10 minutes, bussed our own dishes, asked for the check and left.   Won't even comment on food as the entire experience was ruined by the total lack of service in what is hoping to be a mid-to high end steak house. Just so disappointed in this place, we really need more choices in the N.W. but Fire Rock will not be around long unless they get their act together.",

Considering it was Friday night, 6pm, things were a little busy, but less wait time compared to other restaurants in the area. While I walked through the restaurant, I saw these deep dishes of bread.. and I knew I wasn't leaving this place without having those rolls, hmm. Anyways, to the point. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib and steamed broccoli. He likes this well done (pretty much charred), and he got exactly what he wanted! I had cheese ravioli and I'll admit, at first glance, the sauce looked a little off colored than what I'm used to. But hey, they say don't judge at first glance. Tasted perfect, and there was tons of ricotta inside so how could you go wrong? I hope I get the opportunity to randomly come here again. If you're in the area.. What are you waiting for?",

We had three different persons flash by our table and wipe it , then drop a napkin and then waitress took our drink order--------twenty minutes later we saw her look up and realize she forgot to put the order in the PC,,  ugh   well then it took another fifteen minutes to get a drink.  During this wait we noticed another couple had the same thing going on, they just walked out. Bottom line they have cut back on help and things just don't run well like they used to, sucks its nice place just doesn't have good leadership.",

    "text": "Been here twice now and have enjoyed both visits.  First time ordered the street tacos with a wedge salad and enjoyed them.  They were filling even though they are on the appetizer menu.  The second time I ordered the Mahi Meniguere.  That was amazing.  Would order that again.  There fresh bread is excellent as well.  My daughter ordered the prime rib the first visit and then the top sirloin the second visit since they were out of the prime rib and she said she preferred the prime rib over the sirloin.    Both visits we had a larger party and the service was good.  Will definitely go back.",

I had a burger....it was not very good. Dry and just bland. Overall I probably wouldn't go back. It wasnt terrible, but nothing stood out to make it a  place I'd like to spend an evening out.",

    "text": "Have given this place many chances.  It was good when  it first opened but have been disappointed on the 3 follow up occaisons. I ordered a 6 oz wine that they were out of last visit .  Guess what 2 months later they still don't have it !  The server said they haven't updated the menu. I ordered a 9 ounce glass  and he said I should get the 6 oz since it as happy hour and it wold be a better deal. OK.  I waited until the salad came and when finished the server never came back so I could order a second glass.  Another server brought the steaks and she told me happy hour was over but she would give me the 6 oz at the happy hour price. I should have stuck with the initial 9 oz.  The steak ordered was a New York Strip.  What showed up was a 1/2 inch thick sirloin looking steak.  .  I know a New York is 1 inch and up to 2 inches in a good steak house. Server said she would have the manager come over.  Never came. Side note- the forks are very cheap and the prongs are crooked which does not make for an enjoyable eating experience. Check came - wrong check. Goodbye...",

Tonight we tried Ribs & Shrimp - had my shrimp grilled - wonderful. Rib meat was fall of the bone tender. Portions are good sized and always enough leftover to bring home for a late night snack. If you haven't tried Firerock yet - what are you waiting for!!!",

    "text": "Food was ok. We ordered half a dozen of raw oysters and had to send them back because they looked old, was a chance to get sick from it. Definitely were not freshly shucked. After that we were a little skeptical.....but then tried the wedge salad which made up for the oysters. The street tacos were good! Scott made our first time dining experience great here! Would come back and give it another shot, but not for seafood.",

    "text": "We are here last night after being referred by a friend. The food was just ok. It wasn't horrible but wasn't great. It tasted \"chainy\".  I asked for a well done steak, but the waiter convinced me to get it medium well...when it arrived it was pretty red inside. About our waiter... He barely understood English, and I think he also had a hearing problem. It was extremely difficult to communicate with him.  I commend people wanting to learn the English language, it's not a language that is easy to learn... But I think in a customer service role it's imperative that they are able to communicate well with their customers. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls had NO cheese in them. They provided a weird cheese sauce on the side. They could've been so much better with cheese inside the egg rolls. I will say the basmati rice was delicious! We shared a creme brulee to finish off the evening and that was very good as well. We will give this place another chance at some point.",

Arrived at 10:30 for breakfast, and left after an hour - our food never came, no one came to explain the problem & tables of customers who arrived before us looking irritated.  Did leave cash with the greeter for OJ & coffee we did get.",

A salad was not made right.  HOW DO YOU SCREW UP SALAD!!!  And why do I have to ask half the staff including a manager for some damn wine?????  AND STILL WAIT 10 MIN FOR IT.  Did they so much as discount it? Nope.  Full price for half assed service.  Bob Taylor's ranch house is now my only go to for steaks.  I've had enough of this \"we don't care\" attitude at firerock.",
