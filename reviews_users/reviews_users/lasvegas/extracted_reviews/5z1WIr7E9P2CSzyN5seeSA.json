    "text": "Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (17 of 365).  1 star = for the environment.  If you want to go to brunch in an old school Vegas atmosphere, I suggest you go to Sterling Brunch at Bally.  It has that feel good environment like you were living here in the olden days.  2 stars = Bottomless lobster tails; and big ones too!  If you love Lobster tails, then I highly recommend you come here.  It is seafood galore here, and there is quality you can definitely taste.  The brunch not only has lobster tails, but it has crab legs, king crab legs, huge shrimp, fresh oysters (and really fresh to taste), and yummy caviar served at the sushi station.  I like to cut up the lobster tail and put it in my lobster bisque; mmm so good!    3 stars= Bottomless mimosas are a huge plus with real champagne, from Champagne, France!    4 stars = Wait staff here, and the chefs behind the brunch bar are super nice and friendly.  5 stars = Breakfast.  Can't have brunch w/ out the breakfast.  They have belgian waffles, eggs benedict, eggs cooked the way you like, and other options that I'm sure will please anyone's taste buds!  Not to mention, they have a crepe station and will even add rum!  Dessert station is a little rusty with little selection, but from what little they have, tastes good!  This is a brunch you have to try if you come to Vegas.  Put it on your bucket list; you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Let's start by saying that I do not like to write too many negative reviews about restaurants as I am a restaurant owner and understand the dynamics of this industry. With that being said, do you believe it's acceptable to get sub par or complete lack of service because it's Valentine's Day?   Our day at the Sterling Brunch started with a 1:15pm reservation and hit sat at 1:30pm. We were than told that food would be cut off at 2:30pm. This we were okay with. Our meal consisted of 2 types of shelled crab which required crackers and a cocktail type fork or tool. We requested it and our server replied \"we are all out and will get them once they are out of the washer\".  Thirty minutes go by and we see observe other tables being served crackers. We reach out to the server who admits that she totally forgot. During our rushed 1 hour brunch our water runs out and no comes by for at least 20minutes +. No plates get bused, ice tea/Coke (ordered) never brought, napkins never folded, during our walks to experiment with new dishes. All the while our table happens to be near server stand, where we witness a server complaining about tips three times in a very loud tone. Keep in mind that this brunch is $95 a person. Not the best Valentine's meal we've experienced.",

    "text": "I think I rarely give five stars to restaurants but this by far \"up there\" in terms of food, quality, and service. Just remember though, that you get what you pay for (as in you pay roughly 85 dollar premium for excellent food). But its worth it, so save up and come here for brunch if your ever in Vegas.  The food here was amazing. I am a Seafood lover so I personally enjoyed the seafood offered here. From smoked salmon, Lobster tail, to Lobster bisque, it was amazing. PRAWNS, not shrimp....actual prawns are offered at this amazing brunch. Other seafood favorites I enjoyed were the oysters and cooked scallops. The caviar though I didn't enjoy all that much. They offered only one variety and it was black caviar and it was SALTY. A tad disappointed as \"top of the Mark\" sunday brunch in San Francisco offers a few different kinds of Caviar. The cooked food was also good but I can't go too much into detail as I was filled from 2 full plates of seafood. The Filet Mignon and Prime rib were delicious. Desserts were also absolutely phenomenal!   As for the service, I thought it was alright. My dad noticed that each server took care of 5-6 tables each. The server wasn't THAT attentive in my opinion. Every time I wanted more OJ or champagne, I would have to ask for some more. I also felt like it took a while for the guy to come and clear the table of dirty plates. Very nice guy but could have been more attentive to clearing plates and refilling beverages.  Overall, I give Sterlings Sunday Brunch a 4.5-5 stars. The food quality was excellent and service was just alright. However, as we left the ladies ALSO received a rose (well my mom grabbed her own as the greeter guy was MIA and wasn't there when we were leaving, it THAT was a little disappointing). But overall, I was impressed with the food and service was terrible so def. come check it out. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS FIRST THOUGH. Enjoy!",

Lobster Tail - some good, some bad. I ate 8 though. same as Filet Mignon some cooked perfect but some over cooked. Dessert - Delicious. Almost everything. Crepe was simple and tasty.  Server was good. He refilled our champagne all the time. Don't need to ask. The table was dirty. There was stain on it.  Around 2:30 PM, they stopped refill the food so I only had 50 minutes to enjoy this expensive buffet.  I saw many great reviews. May be it depends on day. Today was so crowded. I used Groupon btw.",

    "text": "Overall: I'm so so so disappointed in this place. My friends and I have been dying to try this place for several years every time we went to Vegas, but there was always a reason why we couldn't... maybe we should have listened to that reason. Seriously, I spent $85+ dollars for this place - next time take your money & do the AYCE buffets for 24 hours for $50 or just go to Wynn/Bellagio buffet. I haven't been to either buffet, but I've heard of only good things about them.   Food:  I wouldn't have been so mad to pay that hefty price tag for this buffet, but half of the food here were not Grade A quality food. I seriously only made my money back because I had the Sturgeon caviar refilled at least 10 times... They had variety of food, which included some seafood like crab claws and lobster. The lobster meat was so dry and the steak was mediocre. Desserts were very abundant and nicely displayed, but I would never pay that much for desserts. Overall, the food was just meh.  Service: The waiter was really nice who always came by and refilled our expensive water from the glass bottle! We also got a cup of champagne with our meal. Although I loved your caviar, I will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone else.  Environment:  The place was sort of nice, but it had a vintage look to it.",

    "text": "Passing through Vegas we had to eat here again and it was even better for me than last time! They switched champagnes and I didn't recall which brand they switched to it started with the letter M (very helpful I know), still yummy though. The service was excellent again, our server was still in training but he did mention where the caviar was this time so that's good that they are doing that now.   They prepared the lobster different this time, it was the entire tail steamed I think, and I felt it was better my bf thought it was just as good.   A few of the other dishes that we enjoyed which may or may not change was the lobster papparadelle, giant cocktail shrimp, trout, peppered salmon and lox, salmon en croute, sushi wasn't bad and they had standard selection, sake was excellent...the brand is Nagasaki (clever). Raw oysters I didnt care for to much this time and they didnt have raw clams, the caviar was still ok but I am still not a caviar expert.   Desserts were top notch, I loved the giant chocolate covered strawberries, they had a bunch of random little cakes and truffles as well as a crepe station. It's worth it to save a little room in your tummy for a sampling, and coffee is included. We actually saw another table order bloody marys which were also included so your not limited to mimosas if you dont care for that, and honestly for that price ($85/pp) they should give you whatever you want to drink.  I was a bit peeved we went gambling after and I did good on the roulette table and got a 10% off coupon for a few of their restaurants and this brunch was one of them (who doesn't like a discount)....I think you need to cash in a certain amount (over $200 maybe) because the bf didnt do as good and did not get the coupon.  So again, this buffet might not have the selection that the other do and the price is certainly heftier but for the quality of items you get its worth it to splurge and check it out.",

As many have pointed out, it is all buffet style, so the freshness and wow factor just wasnt there for me.  My favorite brunch of all time was the brunch at The Steakhouse in Circus Circus...so perhaps I had an unfair bias going in. What I really liked about the CC brunch was that everything was made to order, like filet, eggs benedict, etc. Something just seems to get lost when it gets made in batches and sits in a heating table. I really wish they would re-open that brunch :(  The Lobster was just very mediocre, the filets were overdone, the eggs benedict was not too bad, but still a little dry from sitting in the heating table. The crab legs were very good, but wish they would take the extra step and either cut them open for you or provide the scissors because the shells were a little soft and hard to open with just a cracker.  The desserts were just ok to me, nothing special.  I think the saving grace was that the champagne was flowing (although not as fast as I would have liked) and it is a $40-50 champagne...that is the only reason I would say that the $85 price tag isnt completely out of line.  Overall, the food quality was average and not worth the $$$, but if you like a lot of good champagne and dont mind average quality food, it is worth it.",

    "text": "I gave Bacchanal Buffet 3 stars and Wicked Spoon 2 stars, but The Sterling Brunch despite its doubled price is well worth 4 stars. There were hit and misses in terms of food but the service and unlimited pours of Perrier Jouet Grand Brut champagne made this my favorite buffet on the strip.   Pros  Perrier Jouet Grand Brut Champagne:  As part of their buffet, you can indulge in their unlimited serving of Perrier Jouet champagne which is one of the reasons why I would return. If you haven't sipped this champagne, it's crisp but dry with fruity undertones and a mild citrus finish. Every 5-10 minutes, you could hear bottles popping because they were pouring these bottle as if it was water. Despite it being a pricier buffet option compared to the rest, money is well spent here if you like unlimited pours of good champagne.   Service: Another reason why I would return is for their spectacular service. My server was Javier and he had the most attentive and warming personality. I went here for an early breakfast at 10am and he's the type of gentlemen that you'd want to encounter to start your day. And there's no better way to show your appreciation by tipping your servers well, Javier was informative being my first time and made sure my glasses was always full so I made sure he received a generous cash tip for his service. The other servers including the chefs behind the counter were also attentive with a friendly and likable charm. Even the hostesses were super polite and welcoming here unlike the other hostesses on the strip that come off cranky.   Food: I always prefer quality over quantity but that's rare at buffets but at Sterling's Brunch you can find better quality meats and seafood made with care. Even though there is a limited amount of selections, the overall taste more enjoyable. Some of my favorites include the following: -The filet mignon which did appear dry was actually tender and full of its natural juices.  -The popovers which you may think is a waste because it's purely carbs was light and buttery and they bring fresh ones to your table as you are seated. I actually ripped a piece of the popover and served it along side with their salmon lox and caviar for a mini do it yourself sandwich bite.  -The lobster egg benedict which you have to order from your servers was beautifully crafted together had tastier chunks of lobster on a soft and buttery biscuit with the egg oozing out as you cut it into half. I do recommend sharing with your table first before you order more since the biscuit is filling.  -Banana Bread pudding is something I would normally skip at a buffet because of how filling it is but the caramel sauce and bread pudding was amazing.  -The passionfruit crepe which they brought out to me by surprise along with a lovely Happy Birthday song was freshly made. The passionfruit sauce had a nice tart flavor.   -The dessert bar is small but there is a good selection of sweets to choose from. Also liked how they were smaller or bite sized so you could sample more.   Cons  Lobster: To be fair, I had lobster dishes at Joel Robuchon the night before so I had higher expectation of lobster in terms of taste. The lobster here also appear to be pacific lobsters so the taste isn't as buttery, but overall the lobsters were overcooked thus leading to a rubbery taste. Even though the lobster was a disappointment, their snow crab legs was delicious.   Hours of Operation: My boyfriend extended our trip just so I could attend the Sterling Brunch which is ONLY offered on Sundays from 9:30am-2:30pm. I could never make reservations since I'm out of Vegas by Sunday. I highly recommend making reservations as soon as you can since it is open one day of the week. My boyfriend attempted to make reservations 3 months ahead and wasn't able to get a table but we snatched up a cancellation last minute.",

From the sashimi, to the prime rib, to of course the lobster tail. What's even better was the staff's service! We sat at the bar, per walk in non reservation and the bar staff was attentive, polite and one even pulled out his phone to stream NFL Sunday ticket! Can you say great service or what! Definitely arrive early if you don't have a reservation as the walk in line can get rather long, rather quickly.",

    "text": "Remember rule #1: don't talk about the fight club and NEVER (as my wife discovered) call Sterling a buffet. It's a brunch (as quoted by Bally staffers)! With that established on with the show.  With a heavy heart after my experience here I can't score this one any higher than I have as overall there were faux pas all over the place and especially for this being so iconic you'd think my 2 star rating would be ironic, but yeah no irony here folks.  The first pain point was apparently the misrepresentation of price. Now let me start by saying I did the research and expected $90 ($85 if you're a total reward member) and was even told that upon confirming my reservation on the phone the night before, but to the shock of my wife and I it was an extra $10. Now granted we did go on Mother's Day, but the pricing was nowhere clearly displayed and tickle me pink if that just doesn't like a shady practice. The experience was far below that price tag and it was my birthday gift on top of it and I left in tears. I mean it was my birthday so I could cry if I wanted to (you would cry too if it happened to you). Old school song reference I'm sure most won't get, BUT moving on!  The food itself was honestly hit or miss. The stations themselves were small in stature, but did have its highlights in all fairness. In an effort to feel bourgeois I sampled the American Sturgeon Caviar and I'll just leave that one to society's elite. To me it came off with a very salty after taste, but from googling it apparently that's how this particular one is supposed to be and if that's the case count me out! The famed lobster tails to me were another excitement fallen flat. They are housed in a larger serving dish and honestly had a mass produced feeling to me. They tasted far from fresh and some were rubbery yet others were charmin soft, MASSIVE let down! On a bright note, I LOVED the filet mignon. I had helping after helping of this and became my go-to of the day. The meat was pull away tender and had a hint of garlic butter smothered into each bite which was tres magnifique! Another highlight (which proves how bad my experience is) was their Greek yogurt parfait. I even said to my wife, spent all that money and liked a parfait of all things. The yogurt itself did not have that tartness that Greek yogurt seems to have which was refreshing and the granola partnered with the berries at least brought my smile back to the meal.  As you can see there many pictures taken and food not mentioned in my review, but to sum it up 1000 words would not be enough. Was it nice to experience? Yes to eliminate it from the Vegas bucket list. Will I make a return visit? Well Mr. Sterling would need to do quite a bit before that happens and I don't see that in the cards!",

    "text": "This is a long over due review for my visit in August but I doubt anything has changed and things only get worse in the winter time when nothing is in season.  Stay away! I was so intrigued by this buffet because it featured unlimited lobster and oysters! I'm a seafood junkie. Unfortunately, the seafood here is just absolutely gross. Everything is previously frozen, don't expect anything fresh. You are in the middle of a desert.  First, of all, if you ever had cold water lobsters from MAINE, you would not ever want to eat warm water lobsters, especially the FROZEN kind. Maine lobster meat is meaty and sweet (go to Luke's Lobster. There is a location in Vegas) while warm water lobster has a crunchy/chewy or mushy/rubbery texture depending on how it's defrosted. Well the kind of lobster served at Sterling Brunch is the crunchy/chewy warm water kind, no meaty texture at all. The only taste left in the meat is just a fishy taste complete with somewhat of a crunch when you bite into it. If you ever had meaty shrimp vs crunchy shrimp, then you know what I'm talking about.  As for the oysters, omg, they were so gross! First of all they were blue points, the cheapest, most common, oysters you can get (shipped from the Atlantic on the east coast!) . Second of all, they were not freshly shucked. They must have been shucked long before then refrigerated. By the time they were put out, the juices of the oysters have dried up and the meat was stuck to the shells. They literally tasted like old salty chewing gum crud with a layer of jello slime left by the dried up juices. I've had frozen oysters that tasted better. I don't know wtf they did to the oysters to make them all dried up and gummy like that. This is a travesty to serve oysters like this!!  Oh yeah there's caviar? Umm...more like old fishy tapioca balls. Stay away.   Sushi was rice heavy and also dried up.  The other seafood were crab claws, crab legs and shrimp--pretty average stuff you can get at MANY other buffets and restaurants for 1/3 of the buffet price in Vegas, no need to come here. The crab claws are NOT stone crab claws nor rock crab claws but jonah crab claws, the cheapest kind. They do not taste as sweet as rock or stone crab claws. Plus being previously frozen, they even tasted more bitter and the meat, soggy and watery than if they were fresh.  The fillet mignon was not cooked very well, burnt!! Who the hell cooks fillet mignon well done???  The dessert/pastry bar was the only thing that tasted good and the chocolate used was good quality. Selection was limited however (bartender said the dessert area used to be 3 times as big and they used to have custom crepe stations). The only thing that I really liked was the chocolate covered strawberries but everyone else wanted them too and they didn't refill them fast enough. The fresh berries in general were really good, but why the hell would you spent $95 to eat berries. You can buy 7 pounds worth of ORGANIC blue and raspberries from whole foods for the same price. The fresh asparagus spears were grilled very well, too but again don't spend $95 just to eat fresh produce (literally the ONLY non-frozen stuff at this buffet).  The only saving grace to my meal was the bartender (tall black gentleman, didn't get his name). I sat at the bar and he kept the endless champagne flowing, topping my glass even before it was half empty.  $125 after tax and tip (they don't do the total rewards discount anymore)! If you are a big champagne person then this buffet might be worth it. Please for the love of God, DO. NOT. come here for the seafood. I love seafood and the seafood here made me want to throw up because of how not fresh it is. Please don't pay $100+ to eat old seafood.  If you want excellent FRESH seafood and steaks, I would recommend Joe's Seafood in Caesar's Palace. You'll end up paying the same but you won't leave hating yourself from trying to stuff your stomach with crappy food to get your money's worth.",

But it also had a few shortcomings such as many over cooked items including filets, lobster tails, and prime rib. Besides the staples that make this place so famous, the rest is just average. The desert bar is almost laughable being so small with such few items to choose from.   Also disappointing was the service, had to ask someone to introduce us to our server. Also had to ask for refills and bread. Nobody told us about the Bloody Mary bar, either. I was not pleased to only see it on the way out having never been offered any drinks from the bar whatsoever. Overall? I'm mad at myself for spending so much for a less than \"Sterling\" experience.",

The main differences is that I had the lobster Benedict with hollandaise in 2016. This review is based on my visit December 17, 2017. This time I had a filet Benedict with bernaise (magnificent). One other thing I had that was different is a lobster, cognac and boursin omlette. You really have to try this! The rest of the meal was very similar to 2016. I had intended to try different things but what I had the first time was just so good! This meal consisted of; succulent king crab legs and lobster tails (I had 2), the best oysters on the half shell of my trip, black cavier with blinis and creme fraiche and red onions, excellent medium rare prime rib and rack of lamb and sushi. To drink, I started with a perfect bloody Mary and then bottomless glasses of Perrier Jouet. With the sushi I had sake. The good news - everything above is included in the price. Just as good news, the service is second to none. It is as good as anyplace in Vegas, thanks to my incomparable waiter, Sergio. I'LL be back in June. I hope Sergio is available. By the way, I am still giving it 5 stars.",

They sit you in a waiting area with a lot of people then start seating everyone randomly.  It does not matter what time you got there.  I wish someone would have explained this better to me and this was really the only thing bad I can say.  They sat us in the back, a little further from the food, but it was also not as noisy.  In total I had 3 lobster tails.  Although not the greatest quality lobster I've ever had they were still very good.  The king crab tasted excellent paired with the champagne and was actaully my favorite.  The lamb and filet mignon were also very good.  The service from Tony was excellent.  He was both funny and charismatic.  He was actually disapointed that he let my glass go empty.  If anyone is worried about the value you get from this brunch I urge you to spend the extra bucks because I left here feeling like I got a bargain.",

They are only opened on Sunday for brunch, so if your planning on consuming a good deal of Perrier Jouet champagne hopefully your staying till Monday like us! :)  Like I mentioned above, this brunch has Perrier Jouet champagne....in unlimited supply....so its a step above other Vegas  brunches (went to Bachannal (sp?) on our previous visit). Additionally they have a buffet full of lobster, caviar, filet mignon, king crab legs, sushi accompanied by sake, to die for mashed potatoes, bread pudding french toast and several other intriguing items.  So we had only planned on going to Vegas a few days prior and when reading the reviews decided we had to try but when we called they said their reservations were booked a month+ in advance. Discouraged, I continued to read the reviews and stumbled across one that said there is a way to get a seat without a reservation if you wait for a seat at the bar....and that's exactly what we did! We even got down there and didnt have to wait more than a few minutes. :) Good luck!",

Our waiter Sergio keep the champagne flowing...never an empty glass. Some of the items selected were lobster, crab legs, shrimp, filet, & prime rib. Everything was excellent! There were so many more choices like a charcuterie station, omelets, biscuits & gravy, mini waffles & pancakes, lamb, fish, sushi (only thing that looked passable) & so much more but we were too full to try it all. Do not skip dessert. It's a must! They were beautiful & tasted as good as they looked. We took our time eating...never felt rushed or pressured to leave.

This buffet is only available on Sundays, and can get pretty busy, so be sure to make reservations! It comes with endless champagne. If you're a champagne person you'll really enjoy that!   Food overall was great! Most items were cooked very well and tasty too! The service was excellent, our server constantly came back to check on us and made sure all of our drinks were filled! Keep in mind don expect this buffet with many stations, its not very big and their main concentration is the seafood. So if you're in for seafood this is place to go! (cost is $$$$)  Definitely worth the try!",

Food quality is amazing and fresh. Service is excellent.  AYCE Lobster Thermidor, King Crab Legs, Crab claws, Cavier, Oysters, Shrimp Cocktails, Filet Mignon, Lamb and more.  Includes bottomless Champagne or Bloody Mary and Popovers.  Watch out for the popovers because you can easily fill up on those.  (add smoked salmon and cavier to the popover and you are in trouble. lol)  Dessert selections is good but my favorites are the Raspberry Macarons and Dipped Strawberries. Don't forget to check with your waiter for their house made ice cream.  My table split the Strawberry, vanilla and the coconut sherbet. It's was sinfully delish...  Worthy every penny. Will be back!",

The service is still great and the champagne though not Perrier-Jouet anymore was okay. They still have the same fare on the buffet like lobster tails, crab legs, etc. I have gotten better tasting lobster tails at Red Lobster. Overall  the buffet is no better than the Sunday Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars. The worst part was the horrible price increase from $95 to $110 per person. Overall this place is no longer worth my time and money.",

I just realized that I forgot about the caviar.  Dang!  The Champagne was excellent.  The desserts were OK, but nothing special for a buffet as expensive as this ($90).  The orange juice was a disappointment, as I expected fresh squeezed and this was out of a carton.  My filet was a joke, tiny, with gristle and overcooked.  The service was excellent.  All things considered, I give it three stars, weighted for the price they charged and value received.",

    "text": "I've been SOOOO looking forward to trying the Sterling Brunch, but could never justify the cost. When a Groupon came out (2 brunches for $98), I snapped it up!   I made my 12p reservation about a month in advance, then reconfirmed it the morning of brunch (Sunday, 12/23).  When I called, the representative had some difficulty finding it, but eventually did, saying that it was made on the \"old system.\"  When we arrived at 11:46am,  it was a madhouse- people everywhere!  We waited in line for the hostess to check in. She seemed flustered and had a thick accent.  She too, seemed to have some difficulty finding the reservation, but said that she had it and that it would be about a 25-30 min wait.  Given the number of people milling about, I wasn't surprised, but a tiny bit annoyed (what's the point of making a reservation, then?). Moreover, the system they used was archaic. They wrote down your name onto a slip of paper, and tried to keep the slips in some semblance of order, but still separating who was using a Groupon from those who were paying full price, so Groupon holders were seated after full-price patrons.  There was a walk-up bar where you could get a free (included) bloody mary, but I didn't want to spoil my appetite.   After about 40 min, I went to check on our seating status. I noticed our slip on the hostess stand, and she said that there were 3 people ahead of us- noting that the people whose slips were sitting on the stand were next.  I said okay. 4 other parties were seated, and I went back to the stand, noticing that our slip was no longer there. I asked what had happened to it, and she said that the seater must have taken it. I waited, and the seater returned, with no slips in hand. I asked again, what was going on, because our slip that was on the stand and due to be next, was no longer there. The hostess found it- now in the MIDDLE of the pile of slips in her hand- no longer on the stand. I angrily asked what had happened, because 10 min ago, it was on the stand. She initially argued, but saw that I was angry and not to be deterred, so told the seater to go ahead and give us a table.   After that, I was a bit upset and flustered, but determined not to let it ruin my meal.  The waiter was very charming and never let our Champagne glass get lower than 1/2 full. Fresh squeezed OJ was also served, but in those tiny juice glasses, so we had to ask for refills fairly often. I also got a Sprite.  Now, off to the food.  I sampled almost everything: 3 lobster tails, 2 lamb chops, the salmon/shrimp/crab pastry, red snapper, fillet mignon, made to order lobster omelette,  bacon, mini-quiche, mini-Belgium waffle. My husband also sampled the turkey, potatoes, and prime rib.  I found everything to be pretty tasty, although the lobster could have used some seasoning. I was too full to attempt the steamed shrimp, raw oysters, or caviar. I most enjoyed the omelette and the waffle, and of course the lobster.  For dessert, I had a made to order crepe with bananas, grand marnier, and whipped cream. That was simply delicious!    All in all, it was a good experience (minus the debacle at the front of the house), so I have no major complaints, but it wasn't all that I'd expected. The selection is definitely better at the Wynn, the M, or Wicked Spoon (for half the cost), and if you are looking for the ambiance PLUS the delicious food experience (at a slightly lower price point, Groupon notwithstanding), I'd suggest the Jazz Brunch at the Country Club at Wynn.  I'm glad I visited the Sterling Brunch, but I won't be a repeat customer.",

The include a little recipe card for you to take home, but I think they left out their secret ingredient: crack!  Our server was so gracious and kept repelenishing our popovers.  But beyond the crack popovers, the buffet was excellent!!!  Don't expect a long line of endless food, or multiple stations.  It's pretty much just one straight shot of quality, not quantity!  The lobster tails were HUGE, and self serve, so if you wanted eight on your plate, go for it, I'd give you a dirty look but don't mind me.  Crab claws, awesome!  Filet mignon, cooked perfectly and so delicious!  Prime rib, probably the best I've ever had at any Vegas buffet!  Even their bacon was thick and perfectly cooked.  Usually I'd avoid eating (cheap) breakfast food during brunch but, really?  Who can resist a piece of bacon?  They also have a menu of quite a few items, ranging from their lobster bisque, specialty benes, and other small plates.  It takes awhile for the food to come out but just be patient, pace yourself, savor the food in front of you, and your dining companions.  The service again was top notch!  I forgot our server's name, but he was very attentive, and hospitable.  The dining area isn't the largest, or the most elegant, it's actually kind of stale and generic if you ask me.  But, the food is what matters!  The price, yeah it's not for the cheap or the faint of heart.  Runs at $95 per, but, it's worth every dollar.  #GoodLifeGreatBrunch",

The caviar was long gone before I even start my meal. (Next time please don't give me a menu so I won't know what I can't have) I only sampled two oysters and one duck spring roll. Food running out 2 hours before the buffet is over is not acceptable. For the price they are charging, it is amazing how they can't afford to refill. I certainly hope it was just a fluke because of the busy Labor Day weekend. At least the champagne seem to be well stocked.   Food is good but it is still just buffet quality. Lobster tail was sitting in the heated tray for too long and became tough and chewy. Prime rib, filet mignon and the lamb chop were nice but not much better than those you can find at Bellagio or Wynn. Desserts were eye candy to look at but the taste was very disappointing. The quality of chocolate used in the dessert was pretty average. Definitely not gourmet at all. Most of the cakes were too sugary. The desserts were no where as nice as Bellagio's.   The champagne was good. Really good. They even served it at the lounge while you were waiting for your table. Reservation didn't seem to do anything at all. We still have to wait quite some time for the table. At least there were champagne.",

We are professionals when it comes to brunch and this place did not disappoint. First, we were early for our reservation and they were so accommodating; while we waited we were are offered Champagne or a Bloody Mary which was a excellent way to start.  The atmosphere is so old school; dark furniture, green and white striped wallpaper, black and white Hollywood pictures.....very cool.  Our waiter, Javier, was above and beyond fantastic.  Never missed a step.....champagne was always flowing and never a dirty plate on the table.  Plus super friendly!  NOW....the food. Lobster, filet mignon, rack of lamb, prime rib, sushi bar and on and on.  Food was out of this world....nothing was a disappointment.  This is not the biggest buffet (at least compared to Vegas standards) but it is a choice buffet.  The lobster, filet and the Perrier Jouet alone compensates for the $85.00 price tag.  I hope that anyone reading this review has the experience we did......you will not be disappointed!!!",

While yes, the price is steep, if you take into account service and the food quality overall, I think it's quite worth it. In addition, the fact that this place is only open once a week (Sundays from 9AM to 2PM) reassures me that they still deliver quality here since it's not a typical buffet where the food is running 24/7.  Do your research.....when you come here, don't expect every single thing to be out of this world..let's not forget this is a buffet after all. I skipped the sushi altogether (looked unpleasant) but opted for the lobster tails, roasted crab legs, lamb, filet, caviar, & dessert station.  The lobster tails are outstanding and our server was attentive in cutting them out for us each and every single time and bringing us butter. He suggested to sprinkle the caviar on top and then finish them off with the butter sauce -this was an absolute treat!  The roasted crab legs were delicious in my opinion..they were tender and juicy and warm! I hate those dinky cold thin crab legs they serve at all the other casino buffets. These were definitely la creme de la creme!  The caviar (although I've had better) was up to par, and the champagne was very decent authentic French champagne - Perrier-Jouet.  The dessert station was also excellent! Fresh made to order crepes with options of fresh berries and gelato or chocolate & bananas...  My other favorite part was the home made chocolate truffles & peanut butter lollipops as well as the variety of flavors in chocolate dipped strawberries!  Would I come back again? Yes. There are areas where they could improve - sushi and the orange juice...A $85 per person brunch should absolutely offer fresh squeezed orange juice!",

We initially had a waiter that did not explain how you can order the lobster Benedict until I  asked her about it and she suggested we look first at the offerings....well there is no Benedict offered so I was a little miffed that I had to ask for it again.  Anyway by chance we got a different waiter, Duff, who was just AWESOME!  Champagne kept flowing, table kept clean...he was great!  Having a great wait staff is essential to a good experience!  Lobster was juicy, shrimp big and fresh, filet soft and tasty, and popovers to die for!  Thanks Duff and your Seth Rogan giggles!",

    "text": "When my wife and I visited Las Vegas last February, we were disappointed to learn that Bally's Steakhouse -- home to the epic Sterling Brunch -- was closed for renovations.  When we returned to the casino in July, we were curious about the changes that were made to the recently reopened restaurant.  \"How can you improve on excellence?\", we wondered aloud.  Well, Bally's nailed it.  The former Bally's Steakhouse has been rebranded as BLT Steakhouse and the upgrade shows.  The new configuration of the dining room is perfect for a brunch due to the addition of a dedicated serving area.  The finishes are clean, modern, and comfortable and add an openness to the space that was previously lacking.   I didn't think they could improve on the food, but they did.  Delicious Nueske's Slab bacon was added to the carving station as well as a scrumptious chocolate-peanut butter mousse added to the dessert station.  The omelet bar was still turning out awesome eggs and the cold shellfish station was still a winner.  Of course, the Perrier Jouet champagne flowed freely and the service was impeccable, thanks to our server Diane.  Thanks, Bally's!  We'll certainly return to try dinner at the steakhouse!",

Kind of disappointed on that because we hadn't ate since our reservation was at 11am. Overall, good food & great experience.",

    "text": "For me, I did not think this was a worth it buffet brunch. True, there was champagne. True, there was unlimited Lobster tails, crab legs, sushi, etc. However, I felt like there are just much better options in Vegas. We tried 3 buffets, one each day, and this was probably the most disappointing.  Let's start with the good. The service was impeccable. The server were talkative and playful and they really grab your attention and have fun with the patrons. They are entertaining and that's why this place gained a star. Our server was just awesome. The ambiance and the dining was nice which is standard for a steakhouse. They are inside a steakhouse BTW.  Now the bad. The place opened at 9:30 am. They check people in through their reservations and tell you to wait at their waiting corner. When the time comes, they call you to escort you to your table. We checked in at 9 with our reservation, so we did it early. We waited till 9:30. We waited in the waiting corner. We watched everyone who checked in too get seated. As time went on, we realized that everyone was seated including people who came later than us. It felt weird. I had to go back to the front and ask if we had been forgotten.  The hostess then proceeded to print our ticket and had us escorted to the table. This part made me feel like we weren't properly checked in. It started our day on the wrong foot. With that the experience for brunch kind of dwindled as the food didn't really save them.  The sushi was dry compared to other sushi buffets. The steak was dry as if it was under the heat lamp for so long. The Mahi Mahi was tough. The desserts were on par with other buffets. No ice cream though.  For $105 per person, I expected more. It was a bit saddening after trying other buffets before this one. However, if you value the lobster tail and the champagne highly, then go for it. Just be warned that you might be a bit disappointed in the quality of the food.   Just for the record, I had 5 lobster tails, 5 glasses of champagne, 22 pieces of sushi, and other things.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I celebrated our anniversary at Sterling Brunch.  It was suggested to book our reservation in advance because December gets busy. We booked 6 months in advance, which is as early as I was able to book so we were looking forward to this for a while!  Sterling Brunch is located at BLT Steak at Bally's, which shares a parking garage with Paris, & happens every Sunday.  We arrived 20 min. early for our 9:30 a.m. reservation when it opened & saw that there was a line for those with no reservation already.  We checked into our reservation & came back at 9:30 a.m. where we waited with others in the seating area until our name was called for our table. The people who waited in line were seated at the bar & there were a few seats open.  We started right away & went straight for the lobster, crab & lamb! We wanted to go right in & eat our money's worth! The selection of food was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. I was looking forward to lobster the most, but some were mushy. I am not a lamb eater, but I enjoyed that where my boyfriend enjoyed the french toast. The dessert section was also small. I wasn't a fan of anything except the chocolate covered strawberries, but you can never go wrong with that! I definitely drank my money's worth in champagne. Our waiter made sure my glass was never empty.  It was $110/person + tax + tip, which makes it a very expensive meal! It can be good to cross off your list of places to try once, but I wouldn't come here more than that. Other buffets offer just as good food at a good price.",

    "text": "Okay...hang tight...   Since it is soon to be my 30th. My husband has not been to Vegas yet to experience. We decided to take a day trip to Vegas spontaneously. I called Sterling Brunch to see if they could squeeze us in for this past Sunday buffet- since everyone said it is always hard to get reservations . The nice hostess accommodated and we were able to go in at 9:30 am to begin our journey . Awesome feeling! That we were able to get reservations last minute. She was definitely nice.   Let me tell you why out of all buffets in Vegas.. This was THE buffet we had to be at with less than 24 hours to spend in Vegas. My husband has always been a fan of youtuber's who made food reviews . Everything that was on the review for Sterling Brunch seem more than just good food - it was suppose to be this magical feeling of how good the food is.   For 5 YEARS! YES! I said 5 YEARS! He watched the sterling brunch YouTube video review... drooled every second of watching it...   who doesn't love unlimited lobster, king crabs, filet mignon, and CHAMPAGNE! Might I add; also unlimited bloody Mary's ! The list goes on...  Let's start off with the restaurant:  The whole staff was definitely accommodating , nice, very attentive, and as we expected . Our server was Sergio...definitely never left our glasses empty... who doesn't love a full glass of champagne?! Very nice and always had a smile on his face. The ambience was relaxing.. not too loud or overwhelming when you try to enjoy your food. That's a plus!  Desserts:  There was so many different desserts... you can see from my selection of desserts. I'm not sure what they were but it was all good... you can tell the quality of desserts they have versus Golden Corral buffet desserts . However I've seen better dessert bars- where there are crepes, ice cream bars etc...   Seafood:  For every one LOBSTER tail that was firm and good.. we had mushy mashed potato structured lobster tails.. like it was mixed in with old old Freezer burned tails.. KING CRAB LEGS.. was old tasting, not juicy, and very bad quality . This was only one of the few reasons my husband travelled hundreds of miles away to have the sterling experience. Sadly, my husband only ate about 3-4 lbs including my plate.. STONE CRAB CLAWS- definitely had better quality and more juicy before. Did not go back for seconds. OYSTERS- no bad review! This was definitely cleaned well and we went back for more!   Lobster bisque - on point! If you have a good lobster tail .'cut it up and add into the bisque! Loved it! Wish I had more tummy space to squeeze in a few more cups of this.   Meats:  Filet Mignon: a little dry with some flavor to it..  prime rib: good.. there's also au jus sauce etc to come with the prime rib meat.  Rack of lamb: my husband had this and said the flavors were good!  A small selection of other misc. food was all decent and mediocre.   Champagne and Bloody Mary's: Perrier Joeut champagne ! Popped at the table .. side of fresh orange juice. Who doesn't love unlimited champagne on a Sunday Brunch. The bloody Mary's were good though! Your choice of fillings to put inside. Crispy prosciutto and bacon! Yum! Of course, I'm the only person drinking. My husband doesn't drink alcohol.   For $105/ pp . My husband and I do not feel the food selection justified the price. We were disappointed walking out; thinking it would a memorable buffet to remember when we flew back home to Houston. I did get a rose leaving.. which was a sweet gesture by the lovely ladies in the front.   I gave it 3 stars though. The experience was still nice ; my husband can now say he went to sterling and tried it! After 5 years of wanting to experience it. I don't know if we would return for the price it costed. I' think I will stick to Bacchanal Buffet.",

    "text": "$105 for a brunch?! Why not it's VEGAS BABY! Everyone thought I was crazy for wanting to go here to which I said IDC! If I don't gamble I'm going to eat! Unfortunately I didn't plan any reservations even though I had ample time, but if you arrive early enough you could be one of the 12 lucky walk in people who get to sit at the bar! I however did not come in early enough to be lucky. I arrived at 9am and was just 1 couple shy of hitting the bar area. They open at 9:30 so definitely arrive earlier if you are trying to get in without a reservation. If you don't get sat, they'll take your name and information down and they will text you when a spot clears at the bar. Usually expect an hour and a half wait after the first group sits. We sat down around 11 and ooooo boyyy I got greeted by some champagne and bloody mary. I went to the Caesars palace the day before so I was disappointed in the size of the buffet but the quality was definitely a lot higher.. as it should be. Funny enough my favorite thing was the lobster ravioli. I actually didn't enjoy the AYCE lobster. Like it was a different kind of lobster and I just didn't fancy the flavor and texture it had. The king crab legs were also delicious but hard to open, definitely got to get the crackers for those. The filet mignon was good but they were over cooked. The sliced meat section was delicious I had to try the lamb and the bacon. This was a once in a life time experience because I definitely would never go again! Not saying the food isn't good but experiencing it just once is fine by me.",

They had one sugar free dessert and no fresh fruit.

BAD IDEA lol  I really wish I wasn't so hungover so I could have enjoyed it to the fullest but none the less the buffet was still delicious!   We started with the seafood which was what really drew us here.. The oysters were fresh, the shrimp were plump, the crab claws were good and easy to open! The smoked salmon was delicious.. However the lobster was a tad overcooked but nothing a little budda budda couldn't  solve.. I wish they sliced open the king crab legs for you since they are so hard to crack open..Some pieces were a little on the salty side but still good. I liked adding big chunks of lobster into the lobster bisque.. And If you go to the mini sushi bar ask the chef for some caviar, my dining partner, fellow Yelper (Chingoo L) really enjoyed the caviar even though it was quite fishy.. Well what else would you expect from fish eggs...? Haha   The stand out dish for me was the lamb... Omg it was delicious!!! Not gamey at all and it had a little sweet crust to it! soooo soooo good!!!!   I feel like the dessert section was not that impressive.. It looked better in the pictures... When we were standing in line for creme brulee the chef made it fresh for the man in front of us and when we got to the front she just pointed at one that had been chilling there... & there's nothing worse than creme brulee that has a soft top... HMPH   As for service our server was very nice sometimes it took a little too long for our drinks to get to the table but he constantly kept our champagne flutes filled to brim ;)))   I think the best part of this brunch was the drinks! They have a Bloody Mary bar up front that is made with either Grey Goose or Belvedere... The champagne is Perrier Jouet from France, the orange juice is freshly squeezed with a nice pulp, their expresso is strong, they have Zipang sake shots at the sushi bar and they even serve \"Artesian water\" in cool bottles HAHA and all these drinks are included with your meal... TOO BAD I WAS SO HUNGOVER THOUGH... By the end of the meal I had 6 glasses of different beverages on our table  ... Lol   I don't think I could ever pay the full price of $90/person.. And I guess they don't do local's discounts anymore.. So I'm so happy we got a Groupon deal for $98 for two people ~!!! I would probably get that deal again if it ever came up..   Special Shoutout to fellow Yelper JOSEPH P. ... Thanks for treating us to the best brunch we've ever had~!   PS:  I liked how all the servers say \"Madame...\" haha",

And before you ignore the homemade popover delivered to you assuming it's just a filler, taste it--then use it as your vehicle for creme fraiche, smoked salmon, and lots of caviar. And don't ignore the benedict on the buffet line, either. It was the best my husband and I have ever had.  Our server was so memorably wonderful! Our champagne flutes stayed full and empty plates disappeared right away. I felt like I was at a five star restaurant, not a buffet.

    "text": "So brunch buffets are as synonymous with Las Vegas as Lebron is to basketball, and there is a whole lot of winning going on at the Sterling Brunch in the Bally's Hotel and Casino. Tucked in the back of the ground floor of Bally's in the BLT Steak restaurant rests one of the newest, and I will say it, finest brunch buffets in Las Vegas.  Now it isn't called the \"Sterling\" Brunch for no reason, it costs, it costs big time.  Most of us are not willing to pay $90 per person for brunch, but because of the high quality of seafood, meats and champagne that they serve, I must admit, the price tag is justified. I usually avoid buffets in general as quantity is NOT what gets me hard, it's the quality, and the Sterling Brunch has both.  When you are seated you are immediately served two Gruyere popovers. For those of you who are new to popovers, as I was, they are an American version of English Yorkshire pudding. They are baked custard in muffin tins, but the inside is not dense, it is very light and moist. It was pretty insane. It was as if the crispy shell was basted for hours with liquefied cheese as the flavor of the Gruyere was wonderfully powerful. Slather some sea-salted butter on the inside and you are ready to party.  As a start for brunch, or any meal for that matter, it doesn't get better than this.  Next up was the buffet. On my first round I focused solely on seafood, the options were far and wide in this category alone. Baked lobster tail, King crab legs, crab claws, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cakes.  Um, yes.  Out of all of them I recommend the baked lobster tail and the King crab legs the most, the quality of them were excellent and the flavors were good and rich. Skip the crab cake. It will take up too much valuable real estate; not to mention it kinda blows.  Now the offering of caviar is one of the major reasons this brunch stands out. That, and the unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne (a $50/bottle value). Though the caviar is American Amia (bowfin roe from Louisiana), which, though quiet common and inexpensive, is still a buffet rarity and presented with blinis, creme fraiche, capers and finely diced red onion so you feel, well, spoiled. Regardless.  Egg me, baby.  The caviar is just one of the many items offered on their menu outside of the buffet options. We ordered the Caesar salad, tuna tartar, the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster bisque; the bisque was a bit more like a bouillabaisse but still yummy.  Now, they also offer filet mignon, truffled mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as well as lamb chops so one can get their steakhouse on.  I sampled them as a dessert substitute because, well, I've always been more of a salt guy than a sugar dude. But alas my stomach could hold no more, but if one were so inclined, and has a larger stomach muscle than my own, feel free to polish off those dishes as well because they are good times.  Adeye took the trip down Dessert Ave.  It's one of the prettiest avenues I have seen and she seemed very pleased.  Sterling Brunch. You have raised the brunch bar so high we could barely get our legs and bellies over it. Congratulations for redefining the Vegas buffet for those of us who care about quality.",

Desserts are limited in selection and was just ok. Oysters were awesome..they were the small kind which to me look like the Blue Point oysters.  The lobster eggs benedict was made to order and came out perfectly, it was good. Would we be back? Yes Adult $85 (TR member price) Kid $30",

    "text": "I wanted to love the sterling brunch. I wanted to believe the other bad reviews were just divas or a rare exception. Sigh. Biggest waste of $250. It was not a holiday. It was not overly crowded or under staffed. There is no excuse. It just sucked and here's why:  1. We Had to wait 20 minutes with a reservation for two people. Just 2. No offer of refreshment while we waited.   2. Lobster was terrible. All of it was over cooked and rubbery. Even the drawn butter was bad. I had to ask for a spoon the times (never from our waiter... He wasn't too be found anywhere) only to discover the Lobster bisque was the worst ever... And it was also the sauce for the lobster ravioli... Which contained no lobster that we could find. The bisque or the ravioli.   3. After 15 minutes, my husband went and got our two bloody Mary's from the bar directly. Our waiter had forgotten we asked for them and never noticed we had gotten them ourselves. They sucked. All pepper and very little tomato juice or vodka.   4. Orange juice was not freshed squeezed. For $99 per person... Seriously. I'm pretty sure it's Tropicana. I was expected to mix my own Mimosas. Sigh.  5. The desserts were lackluster at best. How does one screw up chocolate cake? It wasn't sweet. At all.   6. Sarcastic waiter that only showed up on rare occasion. Lovely. Just lovely. The only time he showed up promptly was when he dropped the bill off at the table.  7. The champagne was good and flowed freely. But I could have bought a half case of it and a good meal for what we spent. And the self mixing of my Mimosas is annoying at best.  We will never go back.",

This will definitely be a must-do anytime we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I eagerly decided to write my 50th review of Bally's Sterling Brunch, unfortunately, this visit wasn't like previous ones.  After having made a reservation about 3 weeks ago, we arrived a bit before our time and were promptly seated at noon. Since it was just the two of us, we were seated at a small two person table off to the side. No problem.  I mainly come to the brunch for the seafood treats and the Perrier-Jouet (always yummy).  I was surprised to learn that the Stone Crab claws had been substituted with Jonah Crab claws (which are a cheaper version of the Stone)  Ok, I thought, I will gladly try them out.  They were basically tasteless and small;one tasted like ammonia and rotten fish. Strike one.  If you are going to charge $95 (yes, the price went up) please use fresh, high quality seafood without using cheaper substitutes, diners deserve that.   The second strike involved the Alaskan King crab of which I'm a major aficionado.  The size was average.  But, and this is among the worst aspects, when I went to \"crack\" them, they bent, which means when defrosted they were left to soak in their own water for a long period of time instead of being properly drained. They were Chinese buffet soggy, if you know what I mean.  Inappropriate for a $95 brunch.   On a positive note, the Neuske bacon was a major hit.  Very thickly sliced portion of smoked pork heaven.  Really fantastic!  Our server was Lupita who was friendly and provided some nice recommendations, but was slow on the draw when refilling our champagne flutes.  I will have to really think twice about returning to this brunch.  It's definitely not like it used to be.  Sadly.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I jokingly made reservations two months ago after watching the Buzzfeed episode about it. When the weekend of our reservation came up, we decided to just say \"fuck it\" and go. My girlfriend ended up driving 9 hours round trip that day for a two hour brunch. Was it worth it? Probably not with the driving, but we had a great time celebrating our 6 month anniversary. Anyways, the food:  First on the champagne, I guess I'm not as big a fan of champagne as I thought. My girlfriend loved it though and I guess from what everyone else says, it is pretty quality. Orange juice was good. Onto the food: I tried a little of almost everything. There isn't a huge selection as many other reviews have noted, but when the offerings are all some of the most expensive things one can eat, there isn't much to complain about. For the seafood offerings, it wasn't the best time of the year to be eating oysters and lobster, but everything still tasted pretty good. The shrimp were too fishy smelling imo and the oysters weren't great, but the lobster and crab were. The lobster can be sort of hit or miss in terms of how well it's cooked (rubbery or overcooked), but overall A+ for me. They offer a pretty wide selection of meats as well; my favorites were the prime rib and lamb. While they do have filet mignon, it's only cooked medium (I guess this is just because most people want it medium??) which in my book is a crime. It was still good, but it could have been so much better if it was medium rare! The lamb with mint jelly and prime rib and horseradish were both very good though. My girlfriend loved the salmon and chicken dishes as well. Some other assorted things we got were the pumpkin ravioli, fresh fruit, caviar and desserts. Ravioli was good (a little rich), fruit was delicious and desserts weren't that amazing in taste, but did look very pretty! It was our first time trying caviar and we both liked it a lot haha.   Finally on service, we didn't interact much with our waittress, but she was very cheerful and nice when she came by. Lots of good vibes! We were always topped off on champagne and never waited long for anything. Overall, probably won't be going back just because of the $$, but it was a great experience!",

    "text": "A bit overpriced ($90 / $85 with the Total Rewards card); and not a good return on that money.  We were here on 09/28/14 Sunday with a 12pm reservation.  First of all, if you still decide to go, make your reservations for the earlier times (9:30am to 12pm), as they do tend to run out of the better things after 12pm.  You can sign up for the free Total Reward card at the Bally's hotel, where the buffet is at; located at the same BLT Steak restaurant; which turns into the steakhouse in the evenings.  The Pros: AYCE lobster, lamb chops, caviar, champagne, & king crab legs, and they give you a Popover at the beginning of the meal (but they ran out of them at around 1:30pm)  The Cons: The lobster was a bit tough; and after around 1pm, instead of a whole lobster tail, they started putting out a half tail.  When we arrived at 12pm, we heard they had run out of oysters already.  The filet Mignon was just a small piece of meat in a small pan, not very tasty, actually kind of bland.  The nigiri sushi didn't look fresh; Genki sushi tasted better.  Lobster bisque (which you have to order from the waiter) was bland.  The service was also lacking; as our waiter catered to a certain table of 6, and pretty much ignored us.  Overall; it's a quantity over quality.  We came for the AYCE lobster , filet Mignon, and crab, and the pictures here did look great.  But it was a disappointment.  For your money, find another buffet.  :(",

I am so happy to report, I was NOT disappointed!!!!  First, we had two great gentlemen tending to our every need.  Joe and another fellow who have been working together for years.  They are both extremely friendly and I never, ever had to look for him and the champagne was kept full.  Oh the champagne!!!  The do not have a ton of food items but  more than enough to choose from and all were very well done.  The lobster tails were huge (I was determined to get my moneys worth between that and the champagne), the filet mignon was excellent and I enjoyed the salmon (in small portions, already to go) with the spicy sauce.  They have a full dessert bar with individual items and I saw many people indulging in that.  We stayed for about 2 hours and never felt rushed and definitely had to do some walking afterwards to prevent going back to the room for a nap!!  It cost $110 per person plus tip but I so enjoyed it, we are going to book it again for our September trip.  I thought it was going to be a one time thing that I could cross off my bucket list but it was just too enjoyable.",

They require reservations so make sure you plan ahead of time instead of trying to walk in. The service is impeccable, my champagne glass was never empty and my dishes were always gone by the time I got back from the buffet line.  The food is an awesome selection of meat and seafood. The selection is not as diverse as Bacchanal or Bellagio but all of it is delicious and hi quality. The king crab legs are humongous, larger than Bellagio and way larger than the small snow crab legs at Bacchanal. They serve grilled lobster that is lightly seasoned which is perfect. The lobsters are huge too so they definitely didn't skimp there. The rack of lamb is tender and juicy, cooked to around medium. The prime rib and filet were well cooked and seasoned. They have other stuff too but this is the stuff you want to be getting at these buffets.  Their dessert selection is not as diverse as Bellagio or Bacchanal but it's quite good and I love that they have a bowl of fresh berries as well.

Reading the past reviews on here dating back five years ago, from reading there review and from experiencing first time I can definitely say that it has changed.  First of all expect to eat premium quality seafood: Giant size Lobster tail cooked, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, fresh oysters, salmon, and seafood dishes is just the beginning.  The lamb that is cured with chimichurri and cooked to perfection, filet mignon in little cast iron was delicious. Pop over breads warm and fresh. Caviar however you want to eat it. Bottomless champagne, orange juice, and coffee.  They make delicious omelette with lobster fillers, egg benedicts with delicious hollandaise sauce.  Those were just some of the highlights I indulged in.  We got there at 9:15am and where promptly to sit 9:30am. Yes it's early, but we knew that it was going to be early so we made sure we were ready to eat a brunch that early. After eating three lobster tails, that itself basically paid the meal. I was still hungry, and I tried it all.  The dessert to me was just right, I came for the seafood and the dessert was just a plus.  It was not easy getting in to eat at this place its popularity has grown extensively, but if you are looking for a exclusive early seafood brunch experience with top notch service, then this is a must stop once in a lifetime experience while you are in Vegas.  I would definitely recommend this place! Come hungry and ready to eat!",

    "text": "Ok I finally went to Sterling Brunch today and even though I was very hungry (flight from LA was 5h delayed and got in at 11pm yesterday - didn't eat anything since) I couldn't even eat close to how much I expected to do.   My tally was 2x Lobster Tails, 2x (American) Caviar, 2x Lamb, 1x Mashed Potato, 1x Prime Rib, 3x Small FM Skillet, 1x Lobster Ravioli, 2x Lobster Bisque, some King Crab, some Shrimp with cocktail sauce.   Thinking about it it actually was a bit more than I thought it was. :) Anyway the total was 95$++ so 102$ incl tax plus 15$ tip. Service was nice all around. It was fun to go once and have the experience at least once but I think for that price tag I'd do 2x Bacchanal.   I don't think it's too expensive though because the items were all well done and high quality. I'd have rated it five stars but the tiny and sparse dessert section was a bit disappointing so it's 4/5. One thing that was a bit off is that they don't enforce a hint of a dress code. If you have waiters in elegant uniforms and pride yourself in serving the best brunch in town then don't let people in muscle shirts (rocker type) come in and ask folks to at least wear a T-shirt/Polo or whatever to look civilized for such a venue.",

It was expensive at a little less than $100 pp, they kept the bubbly coming, I tried to finish my glass so we could leave, but it never made it below the half way point before someone filled it back up.  THE BEST LOBSTER I've ever had, crab (hot & cold), amazing shrimp, caviar and smoked salmon.    You may get more variety elsewhere, but most buffets are pretty but most things don't taste that great.  This buffet still had so many options I couldn't possibly eat one of everything, and it ALL tasted amazing.  They also had staples like an omelet station, dessert bar with tons of mini tarts/pies etc., carving station with prime rib and lamb, just tons of good stuff.",

We were seated closer to the back of the restaurant.   After we were seated, we had a bit of champagne and then our server asked if we would have liked juice or coffee. (If you know me, you know I love a strong cup of coffee in the morning.) It pains me to tell you that the coffee offered at the Sterling is some of the grossest coffee I've had in my entire life. It was basically black water with a hint of coffee taste. I took one sip and never looked back. Disgusting.  One of the things my husband said he'd read about was how great their pop-overs were. We headed over to the buffet, but when we returned to our table, there were no pop-overs. Our server (usually I'm good with names, but unfortunately cannot remember hers) even sat other parties down near us - and she brought THEM pop-overs, but WE still never got them.  The buffet had a nice selection of seafood: jumbo cocktail shrimp, raw oysters, stone crab, Alaskan king crab legs... Even though our plates were full of shellfish, our server brought us a plate for shells but no claw crackers or tiny forks to maneuver them with. When we finally asked for them, it was delivered to the wrong table.  Our water glasses were empty more often than not and we had to request it to be refilled. Seriously?  There were times that our plates weren't taken away because the servers didn't come by often enough to clear the table. This is a buffet - get with it!!! They also didn't give you new utensils if they took them away with your dirty plates. That was mighty annoying.  Dessert was mediocre. Some of the chocolate tarts tasted stale.  Bathroom is across the way in Bally's. I would have preferred to not walk through that ashtray of a casino to use the ladies' room. Plus it feels like you're going back in time to 1990.  And who the heck said the attire here is \"classy\"??? The description should really say, \"classy, but not really.\" My husband wore a polo with slacks, and I wore a dress... While other guests rolled up into the joint in t-shirts, hoodies, sneakers, bejeweled tank tops, and sports bras. Are you for real??!?? Not classy folks!  I ate all the king crab legs that my little belly would allow. That was the only decent thing (IMO) at the Sterling. Other notables include the lobster tails and caviar. If you're not a seafood fan, I would say pass. The non-seafood options were your basic eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, ... Asparagus, lamb, fruit/yogurt, and sushi.",

Didn't eat the breakfast stuff. Popovers are awesome too. Make your reservations early, guess the word is out. had no problems making reservations couple of years ago. However, This past trip didn't get the time I wanted 2 months out. Was crowded but not a problem as far as getting food and service.TIP: if you are a party of 1 or 2 and dont mind sitting at the bar,you should be able to walk right in. A bunch of people did so while I was waiting for my table",

    "text": "This is the buffet to end all buffets. I have had my eye on the Sterling Brunch for so long but I finally got the chance to check it out with the help of Groupon. When it popped up a few weeks ago, I just couldn't resist.   My fella and I came here this Sunday to partake in some delectable lobster tails, king crab, sashimi and lamb. Some of the most recent reviews noted that some of the items ran out later in the day so I made sure to make an early reservation. We arrived at 10:30 and were taken to our table immediately. Our server came up to us immediately to fill our water and champagne glasses. He also gave us a rundown of the layout of the buffet and offered his suggestions. We immediately made our way to the buffet to start our foodie adventure.   I started with the lobster tails, king crab, lamb, sashimi, caviar and eggs benedict. My fella did the same and we returned to our table. The food was definitely better than any buffet food I've ever had. I was beyond excited for all the choices available to us. Desserts were excellent as well. This is definitely not a meal we will be doing again any time soon, but it is something I recommend everyone do at least once.   It is clear that they prepared well for the onslaught of people who came because of the Groupon that was offered. I even overheard conversations among staff about how much more champagne they had been going through since the Groupon became available. They definitely prepared well. They were well-stocked on all food and drink items and definitely well-staffed. We never wanted for anything and our server was extremely attentive and accommodating. He made chit chat with us and was so friendly, I really appreciated the excellent service here.   Every part of the meal was 5-star from the start to the end of the meal.",

    "text": "It would be easy to write about the food. It would be equally easy to mention the bubble. And it would be very easily talk about the popovers.   Oh, I could write epic poetry about the popovers.  And all of those ravings would be echoed throughout Yelp. And I'm sure you could fine dining that matches The Sterling Brunch. But what really set it aside and place our experience on rarities Brunch Supreme was the wait staff. Please understand when I say I and my group brunch often and brunch hard (they have a website and book in production for goodnesssakes!). We went on January 2nd and we're seated in Diane (God I hope I remember her name right). She met everyone one of out piccadillos and quirks with ease. She was our culinary guide and our jovial pourer (we generally have 4-6 different liquids going at once... per person)  It comes down to one simple moment.  I asked her for her favorite menu item and she mentioned the lamb chop. When she stopped by, she asked how it was. I was mid chew of my first bite and had to admit it was chewy hut very flavorful. She said that wasn't good enough. She took the plate away and got me a new cut. She gave me the brunch tip that I should always request a center cut (who knew?).  That was the single greatest bite of a foodie dream morning. Without great service of Diane, it wouldn't have happened.  In other bits.... there wasn't a bad bite of gourmet goodness. Request eggs benedict.... they are worth it. Made individually like eggs benedict were meant to be made. Stinky cheses. Fat lobster tails. And those popovers.... mmmmmm.  Yiu can't call yourself a True brunch lover until you've been to the Sterling Brunch.",

When we asked for the check she even made a comment that we still had a few hours! I have never in my life heard a server suggest for us to stay longer! That's awesome! A reservation is definitely needed. I made one for 930 which is when it opens. I mainly ate king crab legs and oysters. There were many more options that were great though. I will definitely come back!",

    "text": "I'm sad to say I was actually thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the food here.  I book a reservation for 4 of my friends 2 months in advanced as we were extremely excited to try this place. The hype was real man! The buffet is location inside the BLT steakhouse and all the staff and servers are pleasantly nice constantly checking in to refill our champagne (perrier jouet) and take our plates and empty our shell bowl.  The huge downfall though is the food quality. Sadly for $135 a person (tax and 18% tip we included) it just didn't feel like we were getting our moneys worth. The gratuity is definitely deserved of course, but the price of the buffet 95 each just didn't feel like it.   The lobster was very bland tasting and what really made me feel a little sad was the texture: it was overcooked and had a rubbery tough and dry texture. The steak was also a little too tough and flavorless as well, and the crab legs were mediocre. I actually went a week prior to M resort buffet and probably would have to say the taste of their crab legs were better sadly since the sterling brunch's crab had a little fishiness to it.  The lamb was not bad and cooked nicely (medium rare), while the chicken and salmon were also dry and a little bland just like the lobster. One thing I did enjoy though was the lobster omelet, the flavor was nice and the omelet was fluffy with goat cheese and cooked veggies. It probably tasted best since it was made to order.   I honestly wouldn't think I would pay more than 40 bucks for this buffet and I tried to get my value in champagne (my plan B) since we didn't really enjoy much of the food. I guess my biggest disappointment was the lobster though as previously mentioned. I was just really excited at the idea of an unlimited lobster meal, but I couldn't eat more than just 1 or 2 tails shared since it just didn't taste that good at all..  I probably wouldn't ever come back here again but I suppose it's cool to try if you've never been? I really wish I could have said I liked this place but I just can't come to terms with how terrible the food was for what you're paying.",

    "text": "For the last few years that I've been coming to Las Vegas, if I wind up staying on a Sunday, I will make sure to make a reservation at Sterling Brunch. During my recent January 2018 trip, I  ate there on Sunday January 28.  I arrived about 15 minutes early and checked in with my TotalRewards card. The lady in front asked me where I was staying and I mentioned that I wasn't staying at a Caesar's property. She told me that I could wait inside on the side or come back in ~15 minutes. I decided to wait inside. Unlike what happened ~2 years ago when I (and other patrons) arrived early, we weren't offered champagne while we waited. While I waited inside, there were people without reservations waiting to sit at the bar.  A few minutes after my reservation time of 9:30am, a guy called my name and led me to my seat.  The person who led me to my seat welcomed me back to Sterling Brunch (I guess they keep records) and mentioned his name along with the name of my server.  From there I was left alone for a few minutes as my server didn't show up to introduce himself or to fill my champagne flute or my juice glass or ask me if I wanted to order something from their menu. After waiting about 3 minutes, I decided to get up and get my food. For my 1st plate, I decided to go with a rack of lamb, 2 lobster tails, some crab, some caviar, and a piece of filet mignon. When I got back to my table, my champagne flute was still not filled nor was any water/juice provided to me. I forgot to mention that the restaurant was not very crowded at the time since my reservation was for 9:30am (opening time) and they were still seating customers.  While I ate, a server filled my champagne flute and someone passed by my table and asked me if I wanted orange juice. I answered yes. I asked him if I could have the Lobster Benedict and he mentioned that he would have one made for me. After I finished my first plate, I decided to go for my second plate which comprised of rack of lamb, filet mignon, lobster tail, two types of bacon (the type of bacon you can find in the frozen section of a grocery store and another type of bacon that must be carved/cut), caviar, shrimps, oyster, and crab claws. When I got to my table with my plate, there was my Lobster Benedict. The Lobster Benedict was very good.  While I was eating the items from my 2nd plate (~1 hour after I arrived), the service improved dramatically. I was having my champagne flute refilled regularly and it didn't sit empty for more than 1 minute (whereas during the 1st hour, there were times when my champagne flute sat empty for at least 5 minutes).  I had a few items from their dessert table. While I was having dessert, the server tried to fill my champagne glass and I motioned that I no longer wanted my champagne flute refilled. I asked him for something caffeinated and he asked if I wanted an expresso to which I answered yes. The expresso was very good so I asked for another one.  I asked for a soft drink at the end along with my bill and the server asked me if I wanted my soft drink to go and I said that if it was to go that would be great, otherwise I didn't have an issue finishing it at the table. He mentioned that he would put it in a plastic cup to go.  The bill was $113.66 ($105+$8.66 tax). The previous 3 times that I was at Sterling Brunch, I tipped above 20%. During the 1st hour of my meal, I felt like tipping under 10% since I was virtually ignored for the 1st hour but because the service improved dramatically during the 2nd hour, I increased the amount of my tip to above 10% but far below my usual tip. I was going to say something at the end to the server who took my money regarding my tip amount being what it was because I wasn't overly impressed with the service but I didn't so he probably thought that I didn't know what the percentage the tip \"should\" be or that I was a cheap tipper.  I'm not sure who my server was for the 1st hour since different people were refilling my champagne flute & juice glass when they got around to it but Sergio was the name of the server on my receipt and he was very attentive/helpful during the 2nd hour since I asked him for his name before I left. He wasn't serving me during my 1st hour at Sterling Brunch.  The service that I received today wasn't on par with what I've received in the past (the person who showed me to my table mentioned the name of my server but the server didn't introduce himself at the beginning and during the 1st hour, I didn't know who my server was since I saw many servers passing by my table while my champagne flute and juice glass were empty, my champagne flute and juice glass at times were empty for over 5 minutes, I wasn't asked if I wanted to order something from the menu, I wasn't given a popover bread, didn't pick up my finished plates when I went to get another plate, was not given a bowl for my shells, etc.)  Giving them 3 stars this time instead of what I gave them in the past (4 & 5 stars).",

FYI: They only have the Sterling brunch on Sundays  Bally's revamped champagne buffet is located in BLT steak. With that being said, this buffet offers you filet mignon, lobster tails, Alaskan crab legs, caviar and bottomless Perrier-Jouet champagne and more. Not to mention BLT's famous Gruyere cheese-flavored popovers.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservations and while we waited, we were given glasses of champagne. In no time, we were seated and off to buffet heaven! The filet mignon was amazing! Not to mention their lobster tails were large as well as their crab legs. This buffet has all the quality you'd expect if you dined at BLT steak.  If you're in Vegas, this buffet is well worth the splurge! I'm so glad we dined here and I'll definitely be back for more when I'm in Vegas!",

Lobster looks great, tastes gross.. had a 20 min issue confirming my reservation this morning, and people were rude on the phone insisting that there wasnt a reservation in my name (there was it took them 20 to find it). I get here they make me wait (the point of reservations are that you dont wait). This is not the type of service expected from 100 dollars a head.  Then theres the buffet. Nothing is prepared well at all. The consistancy of the lobster was rubber, the steak was overcooked, and the prime rib was under cooked.  Also the buffet itself it TINY.  None of the waiters seem to know what they are supposed to be doing, our waiter is so consumed with running around with champagne and taking pictures of people, that she is not actually serving. I feel like ive been completely ripped off (a common theme with vegas).  This is the first review I have ever written on yelp, i am not a reviewer, and i am not a fan of how everybody thinks they are a critic, however i felt like writong this review is an act of community service. Do not come here. You will have a much much better time at the wynn brunch for half the money , from ambiance to service to food quality. This is not the buffet you are looking for.  Also, i have written this entire review while waiting for them to bring me my eggs benidict (only thing worth eating here; its not on the buffet, you have to request it special)  Fuck this place, it sucks.",

    "text": "Getting here  Sterling Brunch's pitch is a buffet with lobster tails, king crab legs, filet mignon steak, and many more. Reservations go out many months in advance and unless you live close by, chances are you'd have to plan to come here months ahead. We booked a reservation three months in advance and finally this weekend, we arrived. There is a standby line if you don't have a reservation, but get there early as the line tends to get long and we saw they had to turn people away.  The food  One word: terrible. I wouldn't even call it overpriced if you're thinking I'm reviewing it based on value and how much we paid for the meal. Food here being terrible is an objective statement and I wouldn't pay anything to eat food quality this poor. Beginning with the lobster tail, the majority of the tails coming out were extremely mushy and literally falls apart when you pick them up and get this, the lobster has a paste-like consistency in your mouth. It was disgusting to be honest, and maybe one out of every five tails were firm enough to be edible. At first I thought it was due to them being undercooked, but looking this up, it's due to them buying the cheapest lobster from warm waters, not cold like Maine lobster, and they've been previously frozen, thawed, and refrozen. Understand you're getting the worst of the worst quality lobster anywhere in the world by coming here.  The filet? I had three and two of them were cooked well-done and super dry. The third was cooked medium, but the flavor was lacking. The meat was not tender and lacked any kind of seasoning. If you've actually had good filet mignon from great steak houses, you'd know the difference quickly and they're night and day. King crab legs? Really really small. They're about the same size as snow crab legs and you know that's just not right. King crab legs are suppose to be around two inches in diameter. The crab lacked the sweet flavor that's to be expected and the payoff of getting through that tough shell just isn't worth it. What else... the popover bread also wasn't baked completely through such that the inside is uncooked dough. Oysters looked old and not fresh. The shrimp was tough and flavorless. Some things that were okay are the banana french toast, waffles, and maybe the fruit cups, but let's be honest, you're not paying this kind of money for these items.  Service  Our water cups were left empty until the end of our meal. 'Nuff said.  Value  The price of this brunch is $125 per person. Total with tax and tip for two people is around $320. This is Vegas. There are just so many great food options around. Save your money and go anywhere else. Seriously. We would not come back here for any price. You couldn't pay me to come eat here again. You've been warned.",

The turn overs are also incredibly delicious, eggy and soft and fluffy, they've really perfected the formula.  But now, add back in the 100$ price tag. Realize it is entirely boosted on incredibly mediocre caviar and champagne, and realize this was not worth the money.  If you love lobster, this is worth it maybe. The lobster is good! Well cooked, tender. Not the best lobster in the world but very good, and lobster has unique enough of a texture and taste that truly it is incredible to eat with without limit.  But it's hard to justify the price tag still because the champagne tastes bitter and cheap, and the caviar tastes less like the ocean and more like dead fish. Not to mention, despite the unlimited caviar, they provide almost nothing to actually enjoy it. No freshly baked bread slices, cheese, etc etc.  So if the price of this buffet was 60$ a person and simply did not come with the caviar and champagne, I would whole heartedly recommend it.  As it is though, the price tag somewhat ruined the meal.",

Our expectations for this place were really high due to years of wanting to go. The buffet options are few, everything lacked seasoning and flavor. Oysters looked disgustingly old. A lot of lobsters were over cooked and mush. It's a tired ambience and decor that I thought I was at a Red Lobster. I think at one time this place was good but has gone down hill. My tip to them if you are going to have a limited selection of food make them shine. Just because you have unlimited doesn't mean you sacrifice the quality. The Rio seafood buffet is better in my opinion.",

First, the price went up, way to much to be honest. We both thought it was $100, NOT!!!! It was $125 per person. Sorry, but no Brunch is worth that price. By the time we finished, the day cost for 2 just under $300., THATS tax and tip.. little hard to swallow. Now with the good stuff. All you can eat lobster, filet, prime rib, lamb chops, pork belly, lobster ravioli, caviar, salmon, oysters  , clams, extra large shrimp cocktail, and much more. They sent out warm cheese popovers that were unreal. Made to order eggs benny, great. The list could go on and on, but you get the picture. Top of the line food, for an expensive price. Honestly, even though the price is to much, I know we got our money's worth. Many table didn't, many had one plate and ended there meal. Not a chance with us, we crushed 11 7-8oz lobster tales, large number of shrimp, and steaks. All were extremely good. But my roommate and I really loved the food, but the favorite for both of us was the  banana foster French toast. This stuff was out of this world. I've never had anything like this. By far my favorite item. Can't say enough about it.   Anyway, if your wanting to go and never have been, try it.",

    "text": "The first time I ate here, I Paid $50. That was a long time ago. The 2nd time was $85. This last Sunday was $125. It is not worth it and these are the reasons:  1) They don't serve Perrier Jouet Champege anymore which is over $50 a bottle.  Now they serve Nicolas Feuillatte which is a lot cheaper.  2) The lobsters are not that fresh. I think these are frozen lobsters. The meat is mushy. I bought frozen lobsters from Costco and they taste better.   3) The king crap legs are small and that's not a big problem, but the meat is again mushy.  4) The Oysters were not fresh. They look old and dry.  Other than the above, the rest are fine especially the lamb. Service was excellent.  If you go there mainly for lobsters, I suggest getting the frozen ones (just the body) from Costco. They are about $25 a pound and they taste a lot better.  Live lobster are expensive this year around $12 a pound from local Chinese supermarkets. If they drop drown to $8 to $9 a pound, I usually buy two 2.5-pounder, take it to BBQ King, a Chinese Restaurant in Vegas off Spring Mountain. They only charge about $18 to cook them Chinese style with ginger and green onion. You will have the best Lobster in the world.   These are a few Casinos in CA that serve all you can eat lobsters: Pala Casino San Manuel Casino Valley View Casino  They are around $40.  One of the best seafood buffet in the world is at the Hyatt Hotel in Macau.  They have fish tanks keeping lobster, fish and shell fish alive.  You point to the lobsters you like and they'll give it to one of the 10 chefs that will prepare them.  It is called the Mezza9 in Macau China.",

They were directing racial slurs and staring at us, the guy even came over at one point and got in my face because I piled a plate full of lobster and oysters and he took issue with it?  The problem lies in the fact that we talked to the servers and management about this and they did nothing. They didn't move us or them, despite my requests and simply indicated that we could get security involved. I didn't want to cause any additional headaches so we simply just left. Our bill wasn't comped either and I understand this is a unique situation, but the response by management is absolutely horrendous and should not be tolerated.  Food was fine, experience was not",

    "text": "I heard this was the best brunch in town, so made reservations. The day I went, I went to Bally's and thought I showed up to the wrong hotel because there is no signs for it, even the people at the front of the hotel acted confused about its existence. I believed this too because, let's be honest, Bally's is an incredible ugly hotel from the outside. It was plausible such a fine buffet would not be located in such a crap looking hotel. I finally figured out it's at the BLT Steakhouse inside there.  It's a very expensive buffet, but I'm a big eater, so I got my money's worth. The all you can eat lobster tails made it worth the admission alone. These were not little slipper lobster tails, but actual proper lobster tails. Pro tip, take the lobster meat and put it inside the bisque.  They actually have a caviar service there with what appears to be proper sturgeon caviar along with the accoutrements (blini, creme fraiche, chopped up egg whites/yolks, etc). But the real fun part is seeing what caviar will work with other than the traditional way, which is seldom an option in life. Caviar on top of lobster? Caviar on top of prime rib? Caviar on top of some macaroons? Why not!  The jumbo shrimp served were unusually good quality for a buffet, not the normal mushy shrimp you find at lesser buffets.   An impressive antipasto section. Lots of ways to customize food with various sauces.  For the beef and lamb lovers, they have you covered too with very high quality cuts.  Their sushi selection I would say is a disappointment. It seemed rather sloppily presented and not that interesting. But there is a million all you can eat sushi joints these days, so really I wasn't there for the sushi anyway.  Likewise, the dessert selection was only okay. There could have been more selection and interest there. There wasn't even ice cream or gelato. So if you're big on dessert for your buffet, you might be put out.  But if you want to eat a lot of top notch proteins, you will be a happy glutton.",

While the food is most fresh in the early mornings, I really don't reccomend eating here beore 11am. Unless you regularly eat seafood for breakfast, Sterling is best enjoyed as lunch.  Sterling is the best hidden buffet in Vegas. You won't find this buffet on the Buffets of Buffets packages deal. You won't find this advertised at Ballys. You will however, find this restaurant on Yelp (which is how I found out Sterling).  You will see other reviews about this place mentioning \"Old Vegas.\" The decor is reminiscent of Old Vegas. Carved wooden banisters, dim lighting, the uniforms of the staff- all Old Vegas. This is a restaurant that I would imagine Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta eatting at to discuss 'business.'  The food selection is the best I have ever had for a buffet (lobster tails, rack of lamb, filet mignon, caviar, sashimi, king crab, oyster shooters, snow crab). Okay, the selection is there, but how about the quailty of the food? The lobster tails (approximately 10-12 oz in size) were cooked slightly more well than I would have personaly preferred, but  seasoned well. The filet was tender, moist, and seasoned well. There as a lack of charring on the outside, but I was not anticipating that for the quantity they had produced. Like all King Crab served outside of Alaska, Sterling's King Crab is brined, previously cooked, and previously frozen. The caviar is not of the highest quality, but it makes an excellent condiment and I used it like salt. This is gluttony on an exponential level.  For 120.00 tab, did I eat my money's worth? YES, HELL YES. Would I come here again? Yeah, but only for a really special occassion or if I win big at the tables.",

Next, I had the lobster tail, filet and caviar.  All was wonderful.  I told myself that I would eat three lobster tails, but I just had to try everything and got full fast.  The sea bass was a great surprise. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was wonderful.  My husband doesn't like seafood and was very happy with the other choices, though thought my hollandaise ( on the eggs benedict)  is much better :).  The croissant french toast was to die for.I'm not sure how I feel about the tipping stations, as the buffet was very expensive in itself.  My tip would be to get the lobster, filet and sides and plate them as if you were at a restaurant.  I think I would have enjoyed it more than eating each out of the little dishes.  When I left, I wasn't sure if I would go again, but in retrospect, I think we will.",

I think the problem for me was the fabulous reviews I saw and they fact that they were booked 3 months out so I had a long time to anticipate this brunch.   Was able to get a reservation during March Madness when friends were in town.  Everybody was excited.  All of the food was good, some things were really good but nothing blew me away.  The big problem was the limited selection, there was no salad bar, limited desserts, just not enough variety.  If the price was 50-60 it would be worth it but like a few reviews mentioned, it's not worth $100, actually $135 after taxes and gratuity.  I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "After going twice, I have to say my fiance and I are definitely fans. My fiance comes from a family of chefs, so when I say his taste buds are picky... they are as picky as they come. First time we went to Sterling Brunch was back in the beginning for April to celebrate my 30th birthday. Sterling Brunch is definitely one of those places we consider a celebratory dining indulgence; @ $99/person, it's one of those places we only considered coming to for a special occasion.   Our first experience, we were not prepared at all on how to \"tackle\" the world famous brunch on the strip. We of course made reservations; which are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. You can walk in if you get there before opening at 930am in hopes to sit at the bar, but this place take reservations as far as 3-6months out. So we knew to make reservations. We were seated right away,  but we were so excited to eat and try everything, after 45mins I was ready to tap out, having only eaten 2 lobsters tails (along with the other bunch options but I was hoping to have eaten more Lobster Tails).   This second time around, July 30, we were ready to take this brunch on! Secret move we made this time was I grabbed our desserts first, because the Lobster tail is replaced like clockwork, but those humungous chocolate covered strawberries go super quick and are not refilled as quickly as they go. So tip to the wise - grab your dessert delectables first. This time around we were able to stay at the brunch from 930am - 12pm-ish. We took our sweet time, didn't fill our plate every time, eat slow, and really enjoyed every bite we took along with every glass of champagne I downed.   So details on the food/drink experience:  First off, you can't go wrong with bottomless champagne or mimosas. And I love the fact that at every table, they pop open a new bottle of champagne, so it really makes it special for celebratory occasions, or even just to make the brunch experience itself special, (second time around we were celebrating our engagement). I even had to cut our server off on refiling my glass of champagne because they will just continue to refill and refill and refill.   Now the food. O H M Y G O S H!!! Lobster tails are huge and flavorful and cooked to perfection. Shrimps are jumbo peeled with only tail on, Crab legs are steamed with a slight crack to help crack them open. They have a craving station serving prime rib, ham, and rack of lambs. Also served on individual trays are stuffed chicken, filet mignon, and lobster ravioli among other dishes. There is of course an omelette station, along with asparagus, fresh sushi, salads, fresh fruits/yogurt, and silver dollar pancakes and mini Belgium waffles.  Now, ask if i've tried everything.. my answer is no. I cannot tell you how the pancakes were, or if my eggs were cooked to perfection, but what I can tell you is about all the different meats served and all the seafood, included the smoked salmon, fresh sushi, lobster bisque, raw oysters, and of course the reason we come, the lobster tail. Oh, and we are not huge bread eaters when we are out dining... but this place.. TRY THE BREAD PLEASE!! Heaven in my mouth is only way to describe it. Moist soft heaven.   At basically $100/person, I don't see myself waisting time on food I can munch on anywhere else. Again, the second time around we took our time to really eat what we want and really enjoy ourselves, enjoy the moment and enjoy our food. When people ask us, \"is it really worth it?\" for us it is, and after going twice, I can really vouch for this Vegas Experience and really say if you can afford it... DO IT. We are fans and the experience we've had on both special occasions has been nothing but a delightful experience.   Our service both times were for the most part spot on, hardly no hiccups, nothing to change our feelings of this place and the experience we get when coming. Although people will look at us crazy that we spend that much per person to eat, we definitely have plans to come back for another big special occasion. I've yet to try the bloody-mary bar, which the bartenders brew up made to order speciality bloody-marys.   I mean for us, this special has not let us down, so it definitely earned all 5 stars, establishment is fine dining so of course the ambiance is eloquent and very professional and clean and it's definitely worth the try!   The pictures I took really speak for themselves on the quality of food, and where is definitely more of a Quality over Quantity type place.",

The champagne has been changed to a lower quality. The price has gone up to $125 from $90. My glass was empty way more than it should be. Crab legs were \"bendy\" and difficult to eat. Our bill was for 4 people so for $500 plus tip we were extremely disappointed. Our plates were piled up on our table two or three plates high at times. In the beginning the food was mouth watering at you couldn't wait to keep getting another serving. Probably spent an hour and half drinking the champagne when in the past we would spend 2+ hours eating and drinking. They have a different vendor for the lobster and champagne from a year ago. We will not be going back. Diamond status or not, we will not be going back. If you expect it to be the same as your previous trips there it will NOT be the same. Be prepared.",

    "text": "Had a great time at the Sterling brunch, located in the BLT steakhouse at Bally's. This brunch is only available on Sundays, and usually requires a reservation. I think this buffet is the most expensive one there is on the Strip, and for good reason. There is unlimited lobster, caviar, Perrier-Jouet champagne, filet mignon, crab legs, and much more.  I have to say that it is way smaller than most buffets that I'm used to, but the quality makes up for the size. Everything is very filling, and I still wasn't able to try a lot of the food there.   My favorite things were the prime rib, rack of lamb, lobster bisque, caviar and lobster. The filet mignon was super tender and perfectly cooked, but not very flavorful. They had plenty of sauces including a chimichurri sauce, so I was happy with the combo. There was also an omelet bar that had the option to add lobster too!   Other things I didn't try were sushi, roasted halibut, biscuits and gravy, salad, and most of the desserts. I tried a few tarts and a chocolate lollipop that were just ok, so I didn't really eat much else since I was too stuffed. I really didn't like the oysters, so I'd stay away from those next time. Overall, you'll like this brunch if you're really into the expensive items and not sweating the price. Otherwise, I'd personally prefer more variety for cheaper.",

In the early days this was a luxurious experience, great food, waiters and staff that made you feel special, a beautiful intimate dining room, I felt like I had a very special brunch secret. Flash forward to 2018, There was a line at the hostess stand ( no more elegant maitre d) we were told to wait in the lounge, no offer of champagne was made. When we were seated the waiter brought us in his words \"some lousy popovers\" I thought I must have misunderstood but I heard him tell several other tables the same thing, and why would I have overheard this, because the tables are so close together. On the way out you use to be given a beautiful rose, the roses are still there but now it is help yourself, wow, that really made me feel special. Yes the food is still good and abundant, but I can get good food almost anywhere, what made the Sterling Brunch special is gone, as I told my coworker \" it is now very pedestrian\", and if I wanted that I can get it for a lot less than $110.00 per person. Do I think this review will have any impact on the restaurant, nope, they are filling seats and taking money, and in Vegas that's what it is all about.",

All I knew was there was bottomless champagne and I was in. But man was I in for a day that was truly epic!  So let's start off talking bubbles.... Now I'm a pretty big fan of brunch with bottomless drinks. But let's face it, quite often it's pretty cheap champagne as can be expected if it's going to be adulterated with orange juice. Not here! Perrier Jouet! Oh and we drank more than our meal price with this amazing nectar of the gods. Our server, Sergio, was amazing and made sure our glasses were filled at all times.   After being seated, Sergio explained that everything was at the buffet except the Benedicts which were made to order. We ordered both the lobster and the prosciutto. Both were excellent. Then we made our way to the buffet. Holy seafood galore! Big beautiful lobster tails, oysters on the half shell, Alaskan King Crab, caviar and tons more! They also had a great omelette station and an amazing carving station that showcased a beautiful prime rib and lamb. I didn't take advantage of this however because I was truly mesmerized by all of the seafood offerings. I couldn't resist the hand carved slab of bacon though!  After stuffing ourselves with lobster and crab, Sergio asked if we tried the bread pudding French toast. We somehow missed seeing it. Sergio insisted we try it and actually went to get it for us. He came back with two plates. One had the French toast with carmelized bananas and the other had a freshly made crepe topped with a divine passion fruit sauce.   No matter how full you are there is always room for dessert right? So we made our way to the dessert station where we loaded up on chocolate dipped strawberries, tarts and other amazing delights. Oh and of course we finished off the meal with more champagne!  Upon leaving we noticed people eating at the bar. We inquired if the people sitting at the bar were able to partake in the buffet and told they were. There were TV's there so that is a great option when there is a good game on.  I saw some reviews complaining about the price. I don't see how anyone can complain with both the quality and service. Not something I could afford to do on a regular basis but this will definitely be on my rotation for special occasions.",

Personal note:  I don't do buffets unless I'm showing guest around.  Line pass or not; comped or not, I don't see the point of stuffing myself with ten pounds of food just to \"get my money's worth\".  For those who think they can, just remember the golden rule of Vegas, the house ALWAYS wins.  That said, this buffet is special.  Do it right and you can have a restaurant quality, near ala minute dining experience.  Excess at that point is just fun!  1.  Unlimited Perrier Jouet NV Champagne. 2.  Gruyere cheese popover. 3. Broiled cold water Lobster tails (firm texture, sweet, cooked well without becoming stringy or rubbery).  4.  Fresh shucked oysters (Pass if the month doesn't have a \"r\" in it). 5.  Chilled stone crab claws (Pass if not October 15 - May 15; season). 6.  Chocolate dipped fresh jumbo strawberries.  Mix and match the order with glasses of champagne between each plate; DONE.  Yes, there are traditional breakfast items (bennies, bacon, meat in a tube), not worth waking up for. Yes, there is prime rib, zzzzz.... Yes, there is beautifully cooked lamb, hmm intriguing. Yes, there are king crab legs, ZZZZZ.... Yes, there are a couple million calories of the most beautiful desserts (sorry, couldn't resist).  Seriously though, why?  Better examples of typical buffet fare exists elsewhere.  Save the beef blood soaked pancakes with a side of crab juice covered in bacon, fried chicken, a slice of pizza, some sushi, and maple syrup for one of those \"contemporary buffets\".  Buffet efficient service but a little slow refilling champagne (they wouldn't leave us with our own bottle of champagne; boo).    Sunday brunch only.  Reservations required (it always sells out).  $95/pp as of April 2017.  Worthy.",

Very limited buffet selection and terrible service for the price. The lobster tails were small, overcooked with the consistency of mush, and had no flavor until you use the melted butter, which tastes like movie popcorn butter. The crab claws were very small, cold, and were flavorless almost like \"eating\" water. Our server was totally a \"pirate clown\"...very forgetful for any drink requests and would only spend time speaking with customers at other tables. Another older female server told my group two different times to ask our server to serve instead of helping us with simple requests such as \"if tea was available\" and \"for ketchup.\" Better buffets in Vegas include Bacchanal at Ceasars and The Buffet at The Wynn.",

It's kind of like a bucket list thing where you can tell people that you've done it but you probably wouldn't waste time or money on it again.  The service was a little slow. My diet coke was never re-filled and when I asked my server (I will not name her publicly), she said \"sure, it'll just be a while though.\" What does that mean? \"A while\" turned into never. It's a buffet and they had bussers clearing tables so how was she that busy that she couldn't grab a diet coke?  Anyway, food was okay- lobsters were good but not great, prime rib was well-done even though I asked for a medium/medium-rare piece, the filet mignon was chewy, and the desserts were lacking and the display looked dirty and messy.  The best part about this entire buffet was the king crab legs- my husband cracked one for me (I don't like to get crab juice all over myself so I usually opt out of crab legs) and it was so meaty and so fresh! It was absolutely delicious and worth every penny. I dare say that the crab legs were better than the lobster tails!  All in all, try it and judge for yourself! However, I don't think it was worth the hype and Buzzfeed made it sound better than it really was.",

    "text": "This was my second time dining at the Sterling Brunch at the BLT Steakhouse. The first time was shortly after they opened. Prior to BLT, it was Bally's Steakhouse who originally had the Sterling Brunch. Sadly Bally's Steakhouse closed 2013 or 2014, and became BLT Steakhouse. I had been to Bally's Sterling Brunch a few times. I thought the Bally's Sterling Brunch was great and worth the price which was less then it is now. In my opinion there is no comparison between Bally's and BLT Sterling Brunch. I went a second time to Sterling Brunch at BLT today, cause I thought maybe it had changed since the first time. Sadly, for my husband and myself it was even more of a disappointment then the first time. Not only the price of $125.00 per person higher then before, the quality and selection of food wasn't any better then the first time at BLT.  To mention a few-The lobster was bland and rubbery. The meats that we tried were dry and overcooked. The oysters weren't very cold and not very appealing. The lobster bisque didn't taste very good. Not what I remember it being like at the original one. I didn't try the sushi but it didn't look all that appealing either. The selection of food items for the price left a lot to be desired. In overall, the quality and quantity was so much better at the previous Sterling Brunch at Bally's Steakhouse. This was the first time I ever skipped dessert at a buffet and I'm a big sweet lover. I also feel the restaurant and food setup was much better previously. The service was mediocre. Seemed more concerned with going around filling champagne glasses. Didn't feel as personable as the original brunch at Bally's.   I have been to a lot of different buffet's on and off the strip and else where for a lot less money and felt some of them were much better then the Sterling in quality, selection, and price at close to $300.00 with tip.  Needless to day, we won't be back there again or recommend to anyone to try.",

Very disappointed.  Not worth the money. Service was great though!  I won't be going back.  Call the manager today 4/29/18 didn't seem to care when I to,d him my concern of the buffet. (John R) pretty sad when I they want is your money. Went to foodie fest at Sunset Station ate lobster off of a food truck for $18. Was wayyyyy better than the Brunch. Save your money and don't go!",

They skimp on selection and focus on stuff others don't have. If you're really into those select items, might be worth it. If not, there are better buffets to choose from.

    "text": "Simply the most amazing brunch buffet I've ever encountered. They only have this once a week on Sundays. If you try to make reservations, it may be booked months in advance.   The items on the buffet you've probably seen at other brunch offerings, but what sets this apart is the quality. The lobster tails are of substantial size. Other places, if they offer them, are smaller and sadly they end up overcooked. Prime rib, slab bacon, rack of lamb, shrimp, sushi, filet mignon, bread pudding, caviar and many other items are all replenished in small batches quite frequently so they won't get overcooked or sit it very long.  Endless mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar add to the experience. A great selection of desserts rounds out everything.   This was the best brunch I've ever had. Looking forward to coming back.",

    "text": "Tl;dr - Lobster and crab were disgusting. Prime Rib was jerky. Cheap items were good. Pompous customer service.  My thoughts: I normally only go out of my way to review something if it is extraordinarily good or if it's...the opposite. Sterling Brunch was not extraordinarily good.  I have never been this disappointed in a buffet before. Ever since watching the video review by Mike Chen (Strictly Dumpling), I've been dreaming about going to this place for a good 4 years.   The only thing that lived up to the hype of this place was the price tag. Now you might be thinking 1 Star? That's a little harsh! Let me explain.  I, like most, came for the lobster and crab. They were probably the worst quality, least fresh seafood I've ever paid money for. I cannot express how disgusting these were. When you eat lobster/crab meat, the first adjective you think of should not be, \"...pasty?\" I was shook. Thinking maybe I got some from a bad batch, I went again and waited until they resupplied \"fresh\" ones and tried again - nope, I was shook again.   I was paying good money... for this?? They had other items at the brunch buffet, but none that I really cared more about than these two items.  I went and voiced my complaints to the general manager. He told me confidently that he has managed the restaurant for a year and that they serve over 1800 customers per day and nobody has ever complained, but he would go talk to the chef for me. I sat down and immediately asked my neighbor if she liked the lobster. She laughed as if I told her a joke and realizing I was serious, said no...it was..how do you say...not fresh.  Well, BLT Steak was kind enough to hear my complaints and even offered me a very generous 0% discount. On top of that, they saved me the inconvenience of listening to their apologies and let me walk away as if nothing happened! So cool!   Anyway, suffice it to say, I hate this place. For the decor, ambiance, and pomposity it carries, this buffet was just the destroyer of dreams and quite literally the biggest disappointment I've ever had in a buffet.  -----------------  Food Breakdown: Not everything was bad! The cheaper stuff was pretty good, but definitely not $105 good. More like $19.99 good.)  The atrociously bad: - Lobster: pasty texture and not fresh - Crab: pasty, weirdly warm, very salty - Lobster Ravioli: overcooked, smothered with bland sauce, dry tuna like texture inside - Prime rib: it was brown, overcooked, really dry - Blue Point Oysters: oddly warm, not smooth texture  The mediocre: - Salmon Bake thing: overcooked but after having the lobster, anything tasted better than that. - Lamb: taste was actually not bad but it was dry, and texture was just weirdly...not fresh - Yogurt: cough medicine after taste - Lobster Bisque: meh, not good, not bad. If you told me it was from a can, I would be just marginally surprised.  The good: - Belgian Waffle + Compote plus berries: this was solid. Satisfying and exactly what I expected, compote was not overly sweet. Waffle was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. - Asparagus: they didn't mess this one up and smother it in sauce. - Desserts: they were all good. What stood out were the mango mousse, the tarts, and this coffee chocolate cup thing. None were overly sweet. - Caviar: I've never had caviar before but this was pretty good. Tasted of intense ocean and was salty, so I combined it with sushi and enjoyed it. - Sushi: definitely better than gas station sushi, better than most ayce Chinese sushi places, but definitely not better than anything from a Japanese restaurant. Probably my second/third favorite thing there.  The best: - Caramelized Banana Bread Pudding: Really enjoyed this. Great texture, prominent banana taste and caramelized very well. - Jumbo shrimp: this was legit. I was blown away by how big and juicy these shrimp were! I truly enjoyed the shrimp and have nothing bad to say about these.",

    "text": "I heard about this place from a coworker and it has been on my bucket list since. We finally were able to try this last Sunday.   If you are planning on visiting, make reservations! It is only available for Sunday brunch so it may take a little planning. Sterling brunch is located at the BLT Steak in Bally's.   When we got there we were escorted to the waiting area and offered champagne. PLUS!  We didn't wait long and were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time.   You can order items that are made to order from the kitchen. We ordered the Lobster Benedict and the Prosciutto Benedict. The Lobster Benedict was fantastic! You can taste the chunks of lobster they used. The Prosciutto was my favorite of the two, however. The salty flavors from the meat complimented the Benedict sauce.   Oysters: Decent but not great. I don't find buffet oysters that thrilling. Lobster: Fantastic! Although some were overcooked, most were perfect. Dipped in buttery goodness, i could not stop eating this.  Rack of Lamb: Tender, flavorful, delicious. Prime Rib: Standard buffet prime rib.  Sushi: Standard and nothing really stood out. Caviar: Delicious! We put it on everything and even ate it on its own! Bread: Fluffy, crunchy, delicious! Mash Potatoes: Seriously one of the best mashed potatoes I have even put in my mouth! Lobster Ravioli: Wonderful, we kept getting more of it! Chorizo Potatoes: Good but not life changing.  Dessert: A modest selection. We had the chocolate covered strawberries and a few pastries. Nothing game changing.   You definitely get what you pay for. Quality food that is fresh. Since they only have them on Sunday, they can focus a lot more on the quality. Champagne bottles being popped constantly (love that sound). They also had a bloody mary bar!   Although it did not have the same amount of variety as a Bacchanal, it made up for it in quality and the selections. Highly recommend for an occasion!! We will be back.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews, I made a reservation beforehand and planned to arrive an hour before so that we could eat as soon as possible.  Upon arrival, there was no line, but the hostess seemed as if we were being rude by showing up an hour early for our reservation.  They said that they could seat us in the side overflow section immediately, and since I didn't know any difference, we agreed.    The Food:  The food met most of my expectations.  Luxurious ingredients with no limit.  My lobster tail was overcooked, but my friend said his second tail, which he picked up right when they replenished the serving tray was perfect.  They had a made to order omelette and crepe station.   The sushi station was nice, but the fish was just ok.  My favorite items were the shrimp in the shrimp scampi (the pasta was over cooked, but the shrimp were plump and cooked perfectly), the lamb chops on the carving station, and the cavier which I decadently ate with everything.  The cold station was a bit of a disappointment (the stone crab claws were not good), but the desserts looked beautiful.   The Service:  There were 2 waiters in our section, and i don't think more than 5-7 tables that were filled (about half the room), but for some reason they seems overwhelmed.  We didn't get any attention for a long time.  I had read that they constantly refill your drinks, and that the service was impeccable, but we were sitting there for a good 5-10 minutes with empty glasses trying to catch the eye of a waiter.  I'm not sure if it was because we were in the overflow room.  I noticed other tables had baskets of bread/pastries, but we were never offered any.  And I heard from another diner that there was a vodka bar somewhere but we were never offered any.  Having paid what we did, I expected the servers to be much more attentive, so all in all, that was a disappointment.    Overall:  The price is high for a buffet. Even though the food items were all luxury items, I felt like the preparation could have been better.  I would have rather spent the money to go to a nicer sit down restaurant.  The all you can drink is good, but would have been better if the servers were more on top of it.  I would maybe try it again with seating in the main dining room, as I think the service and ambiance may be better.",

    "text": "If I am going to write my first Yelp review it is going to be about a place I have been visiting for 10 years.  It is unfortunate that some reviews have placed the Sterling Brunch in a negative light, but I will chalk that up to inexperienced diners or people who expect to use their server as a footrest if they are going to spend $85 for a meal. First the Champagne, Perrier Jouet is a solid Champagne house with a rich history and is widely distributed.  It can be found in grocery stores at about $50 sitting right next to Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label which will be comparably priced.  By comparably I mean exactly the same.  Have a few glasses of champagne and eat just a small amount of food and your meal is well worth the price. The Food:   I always start my brunch with two lobster tails.  If there is any issue with quality (texture, taste, etc. and something I have never experienced) simply ask for a fresh tail to be made and it will happen.   Rack of Lamb:  Do you like the more rare cut toward the center?  I do!  Ask for a center cut and you will receive it. Sushi:  I enjoy sushi somewhat regularly and I am happy with the selection. King Crab:  Delicious and plentiful. Desserts:  On my last trip I was dining solo at the bar and when I told the bartender I'm not much of a sweets person she went and made me a dessert plate of assorted confections.  I started by tasting one thinking I should be polite since she put in the effort and ended up eating almost all of it.  Which brings me to.... Service:  White glove Tuxedo Service even if you show up hungover in shorts and a t shirt.  The only way to finish your glass of champagne is to chug the whole thing.  Otherwise you have a team constantly monitoring and making sure your glass is full. For over 10 years the staff at the Sterling Brunch has taken care of my family, friends, and myself. Great food and amazing service costs and it is always a pleasure dining at the Sterling Brunch.",

YELP has become a forum for whining, complaining, impossible to please, looking for anything wrong, drama kings/queens!! NOW FOR MY REVIEW! I greatly enjoyed the old version of Sterling Brunch! Who wouldn't? A beautiful tray of bottomless caviar, crab, lobster, sushi, shrimp...more food than you could possibly dream of trying in all 1 visit, unless you make yourself sick! However, the old brunch was amazing!  The NEW Sterling Brunch, despite negative reviews, is equally as fabulous! In addition the room has been renovated to a beautiful, modern, upscale, ready to \"compete with its adversaries\" restaurant!  So upon being seated I was greeted within SECONDS by my fabulous, perfectly attentive server, Javier and offered a glass of the endless Perrier Jouet! YES PLEASE!!! He returned with sparkling water and Figi as requested by myself, and offered us oj if we'd prefer mimosas!!! LOVE IT! Caviar, Ahi, lobster bisque & eggs Benedict were offered to us on a special order from the kitchen basis! And I surrrrrrrrre did!! 5 orders of caviar later...I was in culinary heaven! The food is fabulous! Ask to be seated with Javier, he is the icing on the cake!  I ended with a freshly ground & brewed dbl espresso. Oh it was perfection! I AM a java snob!  Please disregard the negativity you've read! For $85 you will NOT leave disappointed! It was already an amazing & special day since we dined on Father's Day & Javier and Sterling Brunch made it such a special and PERFECT memory that I will carry with me forever!",

Sterling Brunch had me at unlimited caviar. $90 might sound steep, considering you can get about two buffets out of that at the other resorts but trust me, they all pale in comparison to Bally Steakhouse's Sterling Brunch  I immediately went for the sturgeon caviar and pretty much topped everything with it, Grab some lobster bisque and top that with some lobster tails topped with caviar (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA?select=p5r69Lsa4VPYQn341ztnKQ#p5r69Lsa4VPYQn341ztnKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1W...</a>) because that's boss status. The lobster tails are plump and juicy, just like how I like my tails ;) Prime rib and rack of lamb is good as well (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA?select=p5r69Lsa4VPYQn341ztnKQ#S_AC7AJUdil9jHRKqiHZfg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1W...</a>) but I'm going to fast forward to the second best thing which is the banana foster crepes! They have a chef make it for you on the spot (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA?select=p5r69Lsa4VPYQn341ztnKQ#WpbsZIpG6cRbw98uh4Uujg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1W...</a>) and you can get it topped with gelato, I chose pistachio and oh my goodness, I would've ate these all night if I could but instead I only had a modest 4...on top of the 15 or so lobster tails I had. Cholesterol for the win buddy! Price came out to about $115 each person for our party of 11, steep, but still a bargain considering how much we ate and the quality of it all. Definitely a must try and certain hidden gem of Las Vegas.",

We ate, drank, and laughed up a storm.   Our server, Lorraina, was attentive yet not intrusive. Our champagne and water glasses were always full and we hardly had to ask for anything. Teas and espressos were offered at several different points throughout the meal. All steps of service were executed to perfection. At no point were we rushed and were told to just enjoy ourselves. The service from each station was as personable as possible.   The food is stronger than most buffets. Offerings such as king crab legs, halved lobster tails, fresh oysters, lamb chops, prime rib, and sashimi were plentiful. Three plates of savory food and one sweet and I was done. By no means was that small meal. Add a bottle and a half of Pierre Jouet to complete the meal. Although we used Groupons for this occasion, I would gladly pay full price for this again.  We even thought ahead and booked a room at the PH so that we could enjoy brunch to its fullest. A stumble across the Paris was the smartest choice we have ever made.",

The table next to me, shared their unused utensils. Had one glass of champagne, and the waitress finally filled it again as I was finishing my meal. The food was delicious, however, my waitress only came by my table twice...once to remove my dirty plate, after it sat on my table ten minutes, and once to finally refill my champagne, as I was asking for the check. Not impressed with the service, however, the food was delicious. Kudos to the chefs, waitress, not so much.",

    "text": "I know my rating is definitely going against the majority of reviews, but I feel like the buffet was definitely overpriced and just a so-so experience overall.  The description of 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" which is exactly what I felt about my brunch there.  I feel like the interior could do with a remodel, or could use a little sprucing up.  The decor reminded me of something you'd see in Reno; very old fashioned wallpaper, a bit dark, just felt kind of tired.    The buffet itself actually doesn't have that many options.  I read that someone said they had uni and fatty tuna aka toro?  Nope.  There was some sad pieces of maguro and sake (tuna and salmon), nothing you couldn't get at your local Todai.  There were some nice cold seafood items (crab, shrimp salad, etc.), fruits, veggies, and of course your typical steam try things such as eggs benedict, sausage, prime rib, etc.  The biggest draw has to be the lobster tails and king crab legs (and bottomless champagne).  The lobster tails were okay when they came out hot, but if you don't get it right away, they end up sitting there and turning rubbery and overheated.  Lobster is something I absolutely love, so I can't complain too much but really, it kind of loses it's appeal if you see 30 lobster tails (most likely straight from Costco's frozen aisle) dumped into a metallic steam tray thing.    The champagne and desserts were nice, but it honestly just felt way too expensive for $85 per person.  Maybe it's because living in the Bay Area, I can get a great tasting menu or pre fixe dinner for $85, where the quality, atmosphere and environment would definitely leave me more satisfied than what I had at the Sterling Buffet.  If someone were to ask me, I would definitely tell them to save their money and skip this brunch.  You're better off picking up lobster, king crab and champagne at Costco, with more money in your pocket to spare.",

If you want to eat at a fine restaurant for surf n turf with a myriad of other seafood,meat, pastas, and desserts, then the Sterling Buffet ranks with the best of the best. It's all you can eat and we are talking quality cuisine here. I'm a big guy with a big appetite, so for me, it was a bargain scarfing down lobster,crab legs, lox, steak, and crepes. Definitely go if you get the chance. Oh, but it's reservation only and they usually are booked every Sunday so call in advance.   Since I'm not really a drinker I almost forgot, but for you champagne enthusiasts, it's all you can handle as well. I stuck with the fresh squeezed juices.",

But times in Vegas change and got to compare it to the similar Sunday Brunch offerings in town.  It got a 3.    The remodel of the Steakhouse is better and much more bright.  Did look much less dated.    The new format of the brunch with some items being made to order in the back is nice in that it those items are still hot.  But you really have to work at getting them.  We asked when we sat down for a list of special order items and staff was resistant to giving to us.  They also never checked back to see how we liked the items or if we wanted additional items.  Caution - if you order cavier expect less than two bites per order.    The buffet line food was good.  Lobster little over cooked.  Sushi selection very poor.  Filet was cooked a nice medium.  Lamb was way over cooked.    Unlikely to go back.  Price of $85 head verses the selection/quality of food & service was unbalanced.  Oh but those good ole days in Vegas.....",

The ambiance is wonderful; the service is top notch, and the food was delicious. The only reason I can not rate them 5 stars is because the lobster was a tad bit dry. They also had a hard time maintaining melted butter. Everything else was cooked deliciously. I feasted on caviar, delectable lamb chops, king crab, lobster tails, delicious smoked trout and cold smoked salmon, and the champagne was always flowing. There were many items I did not get to try because I was so full. I am looking forward to tasting all the items I missed during our next dining experience here.   The Sterling Brunch is pricey, but well worth it, and if you are fond of lobster, caviar, lamb, king crab, filet mignon, champagne, and fine dining in general, then this is worth every dollar. I didn't even mention the desserts. Oh my...the desserts are delightful! There is great variety for every pallet and the crepe station is a must! For our family, the Sterling Brunch is a must!",

Our champagne glasses were frequently empty, table settings weren't cleared and replaced and the servers were hard to flag down. Since we have been going for years and know the servers well, we know the service levels they are capable of providing. Instead, they were busing tables and making kitchen runs for items not available at the buffet service. It's too bad, since this was once one of the places we frequently recommended, even at the $79/pp price. We will explore other premium brunches for our next visit, but we'll pass on Bally's Sterling Brunch for a long time.",

    "text": "I've anticipated coming here for over a year. Overall, I think it was a worth while visit but it's definitely not a place I would visit regularly. It seemed many of the other guests were celebrating special occasions which make sense because this buffet does stand out. I have too many thoughts about my experience, both good and bad, so I thought I just lay it out.   Positives  + Champagne served while you're waiting to be seated  + High-end menu selection not found in other buffets - unlimited lobster, caviar. Not one of those where you're rationed. Lobsters are full size, not the langostino variety.  + High quality food - large shrimp cocktail, jumbo king crab legs, fresh raw oyster, ripe fresh fruit  + Service - high touch attentive service - beverages refilled immediately. Napkins refolded every time I left the table and replaced when dirty.   Negatives  - Broiled lobster was over done and thus tough  - Kind crab leg wasn't halved so you have to crack the legs. Not easy given the pointy spines and buttery sauce coating the legs . Had 1 leg and gave up. Maybe that was the objective.  - $85 + tax and tip. Not for the faint of heart  - Dessert selection was OK  - Ambiance - stuffy dark old school steak house ambiance. Would have preferred for light, airy venue given this is Sunday brunch  - Only offered on Sundays. Not the best day given we've already gorged ourselves the whole weekend and who wants to get stuffed right before they jump on a plane or car. With the LV - LA traffic, pretty much guarantees you'll be sitting in the middle of it by the time you're done.",

Let me start with black caviar - it is not Beluga and as such it looks and tastes completely different and for those who never had black caviar before it would be an awful experience to try this caviar. Believe me I was born in Russia and know my black caviar :-). Second most advertised thing for the buffet is lobster tails - well they were so dry that nor butter or lemon could bring them to life. Hence, the two things I really wanted to attend this place for were awful. Without caviar and lobster tails this buffet should not cost more than $45 and we paid $90 for what the called \"caviar\" and supper dry lobster tails.",

We were seated almost right next to the actual buffet, we were a little higher up so we could see it really well.    The good champagne and high end water were free flowing and each time we got up our napkins were reset to their original folded design.  Of course there was the usual lobster and caviar you always hear about, and both were great!  There's also huge peeled shrimp, mini filets that were cooked perfectly (still pink in the middle!)  rack of lamb, cooked to order omlettes, sushi, lobster fritatta, escargot, gnocchi, smoked salmon, not to mention delicious salads and fresh fruit, such as strawberries and raspberries.  The best part is that they didn't put out tons at a time to sit out on the steam tables for hours, rather they constantly restocked smaller portions.  No eggs benedict sitting on a tray for hours on end here!  Even the waffles were put out in small portions with the chef making new ones every few minutes.  Nothing tasted old or stale here!  The dessert area is by the entrance, away from the other foods which was kind of nice.  Here a cook made Bananas Foster to order, but there were so many other good desserts here I skipped that.  A few different kinds of cheesecake, huge chocolate covered strawberries, fruit tartlets, and white chocolate mousse were my choices.  To anyone going here my advice is pace yourself and take a walk through the casino to the restroom at least once so you can catch your second wind and fill up on more of the delightful food and champagne here.  We spent 2 1/2 hours here before waddling out,  we didn't need to eat again until late that night, and then only a hotdog.",

    "text": "There seems to be two different experiences here, the one that most people have had, and then the one my friend and I had. I have no problem spending money on good food and drinks, but I was hard pressed to spend $85 on brunch that had the word \"buffet\" in it. When Julie K had posted a talk thread informing us of the Groupon Reserve, 2 for $99, I jumped on it figuring there wouldn't be better time to try it. Made a reservation for 10:30, arrived on time, and was seated an hour later. An hour. I guess they figure my time isn't valuable, I could've slept in longer! Finally we were seated but didn't have our drink ordered taken for another 10 minutes, as we were sitting there I was noticing the decor, I felt like I was in a Cosby Show episode, the ambiance was very strange. 80's theme all the way. Started out at the station with the broiled lobster tails, seemed to look good, they were split in half so I grabbed a couple, these were decent but nothing spectacular. I skipped the carving station as I'm not a huge meat eater so I can't comment on that. The entire warming station was set up like a catering type deal, all the food is in a metal flip top with fire under neath so all the food had that hardened layer on top. Not appetizing at all. Went over to the sushi station, ordered hamachi and tako, when I got to the table, I noticed how hard the fish was, I wasn't brave enough to try it. The caviar was scooped from a bucket type thing, I gave it a try but spit it out. It was so warm. I tried the oysters which were stacked on a plate sitting on ice, again when I returned to the table I noticed how smelly they were. So I was too nervous to try them. All the while we were barely checked on my our server, we had maybe 3 refills of PJ (that's basically the best part of the meal so far) we ended up eating mostly crab legs and a few crab claws. The desserts were comparable to Costco, we tried the creme brulee, ehh. It gives me no pleasure to complain about this entire meal/experience but I cannot see how this was a great experience from anyone? We tipped on the full amount, so this still was a $70 meal. This was a huge disappointment.",

High quality buffet items here, and it'd better be for the price **HIC** - the lobsters were tasty, i think i ate 5 of them, and there was caviar with creme fraiche, stone crab claws, you know all the expensive stuff that your parents make you eat at lesser buffets. All that stuff **HIC** is here.   Oh yeah, unlimited Perrier Jouet champagne! I drank 3 bottles of it..... in 2 hours. **HIC**",

The shrimp were as big as a babies fist . The crab was succulent. The popovers melted in your mouth.  Our server SERGE was incredible. Not only was he professional but his attention to us was unwavering. I've never felt like royalty however he treated us as if we were.

I think I went back to the dessert table three times. I was in a group of five, and it was the perfect place to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon drinking, pigging, gabbing - did I mention drinking yet? We did get seated in a room with a wedding party reception, and that was a little awkward. My friend said that by the end of the meal she felt like we owed them a wedding present!  At $85 a head, it's definitely a splurge. But this is a buffet like no other. Truly event dining. Hint to Bally's: I do wish that Bloody Marys were included in the price.",

The only thing that I was iffy about was paying $85 per person for brunch but i must say IT WAS WORTH IT!!! I actually think the 85 is cheap!! Okay... what was good.. everything! I am the pickiest person when it comes to buffets and i love to complain but starting with the service when you walk in, the waiter filling all your glasses ( champagne - Perrier jouet ~ freshly squeezed OJ) The food was to die for , everything tasted perfect.   I had of course, the lobster tails ( wont say how many i had, but lets leave it at ALOT) fillet Mignon, the lamb chops, the eggs Benedict, well everything was amazing. They also had an omelet station with their specialty lobster and cognac omelet. Anyways, i was in heaven. I'm super picky when it comes to buffet and this is the best one ever.   Oh!!!! and order a bloody mary.. delicious!! especially if the night before you stayed up until 7 am then had to be up for 11 am reservations.",

    "text": "If you want to treat yourself and luv ones to a high end quality buffet, this is the place for you. I just had it this past Sun (only offered on Sun, need reservation) They offer high quality offerings! Huge lobster tails, King crab legs, sea bass, fresh shucked oysters, rock crab claws, prime rib, lamb chops, just to name a few main highlights. At first you may think it's not a big deal as the restaurant is average size and the buffet area is small, but seriously did you just read what I just wrote, quality not quantity of the offerings. It's about $100 a person (price may vary) but so worth it if you love the high quality and did I say all you can eat, so if you are hungry you will get more than your money's worth. Also all the champagne, cappuccino, espresso, sodA, orange juice you want, but again don't waste all the valuable stomach real estate on too much of that. Oh I almost forgot about the huge pop overs with fresh sea salt, yum, but again I do not fill myself with bread when I visit this place. It's comfortable and intimate, classy. If you want to avoid the crazy main stream buffet on a Sunday plan to go here. I love the buffet at Caesars and a little cheaper, more offerings, but King crab versus snow crab, not sure of steak, too filet Minon, definitely Caesars a winner in dessert, sterling offerings weaker in this area. If you are a foodie and can afford it, do it, impress your loved one,etc!",

    "text": "My best suggestion is to stop reading the yelp reviews and not go into Sterling brunch with super high expectations. But if you want to keep reading anyway, here's my review... I called the number online, which ended up being harrahs' restaurant res. The guy had never even heard of the Sterling brunch (typical harrahs). I had to ask to be transferred to the steakhouse and the hostess i dealt with was great. I didn't have to out down a credit card tol hold the res like others had mentioned.  Arrived for our res at noon and there were only a couple of parties waiting before us. Reviews had mentioned that they give you champagne while you wait, but I only saw a couple discarded glasses, no one waiting had any. It was a really dark and dreary bar area with elevator music playing. Thankfully we were seated after about 15 min.  The steakhouse was really old school - lots of dark wood, heavy chairs on rollers, dark heavy fabrics. Probably not somewhere I'd go for dinner w all the other more fun steakhouses. Our waiter Mario was great, very attentive. It was a little hard to understand his thick accent, but he was nice and topped off our champagne at every opportunity. Doesnt matter to me but fyi - they don't seem to serve Evian water anymore. Its looks to be just regular tap.   On to the food - they must have the same menu every Sunday because I basically had what everyone else has mentioned. But they seem to have been a victim of cost cutting. There was no sushi, which is fine since every person mentioned that it sucked anyway. Caviar was available only upon request thru the waiter - a small serving with crostini, creme fraiche, chopped egg, onion and capers. Delicious! We got tiny little blinis w our 2nd order, but not the first. Awesome topped w creme fraiche and lobster. Yum! Lobster tails were in halves, and didn't look nearly as appetizing as the pics I'd seen on here. I get what they mean about the lobster getting rubbery as it sits there, but it was still really good. Filets were cooked perfectly, there were also braised boneless short ribs which weren't anything special.  Chilean sea bass was so rich, be sure to get some of the jumbo scallops and risotto in the middle. The meat ravioli and lamb stew seemed out of place, and were just mediocre. Didn't try the prime rib because it looked dry. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly and juicy but they weren't slicing them to order - I could tell by the color on the outside that it had been sliced and sat out for a bit. But still delicious w mint jelly.  King crab legs were warm. Which is a nice change but that also seemed to have sat in the chafing dish a bit too long. The legs were huge, but some were really dried out. The legs were broken off at the joints but were not precut. We were given 1 of those nut cracker types for the table. The can opener looking crackers would've been a better choice since theirs just squished the legs w out actually cracking open anything. The waitors also don't seem to crack the legs for you as I read in another review. See what I mean about yelp giving you preconcieved notions/out of date info? The ice bar had the usual fare - raw oysters (didn't try them), snow crab claws (watery from being pre frozen) and colossal shrimp cocktail. Shrimp was huge and yummy, cocktail sauce could've used more horseradish.  I skipped the breakfast stuff as it looked like nothing special - mini waffles, omelette station, bacon, sausage, eggs benedict and fritatta. On to desserts... I think a lot of the pics on here are out of date - they don't have that tall 4 shelf display, its been cut down to 2 shelves. And dessert was honestly the worst part of the meal. That's the first time I've ever said that about a buffet. There were no cakes, pies, or even creme brulee. I don't know what anything was because there was no signage and the chef said \"I don't know, I usually work the hot side.\" It was just a huge disappointment to end the meal that way. I'll try to remember what they had - the worst tapioca pudding I've ever had (pearls were hard), stale mini cream puffs w overly sweet filling, blah lemon tart, fudge, brownie topped w raspberries, weird berries and clear jelly thing, and the one good thing as a chocolate mousse. That was seriously all they had to offer. For a Vegas buffet that's pretty pathetic and for the price of this buffet, that's a joke.  Maybe its my high expectations that affected my experience, but I'm really disappointed w Sterling buffet overall. It may have been awesome before, but unfortunately doesn't seem to be anymore. I'd suggest going to another brunch and just dealing w cheaper champagne, or better yet just buy a couple bottles of Perrier jouet. Its pretty bad when you're as drunk as we were and you still don't think the food is amazing.",

    "text": "I decided to come here after all the great reviews, however after eating at their Easter brunch at $85 per person, I have to say, I've had better.   I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews. I suspect they are mostly from those that like to get wasted on champagne, or have never gone to the Wynn, Bellagio, or Wicked Spoon buffets.   Here's why:  Ambiance: It's in the Bally's casino which is a bit older, think the difference between gambling at the Bally's casino vs. the Wynn or Bellagio - yes, the restaurant is old and the ambiance is awful. It's like a Sizzlers. Why pay $85 for lackluster ambiance?  Cold Food: They have caviar which I liked, however their sushi quality was less than acceptable. I could get fresher looking pieces at a good kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi place. For example, the seaweed on their rolls and sushi were mushy from probably being made and sitting there too long. Note their caviar is probably not the best quality out there as some guy was scooping it out of a big white plastic container the whole time. You would think this place would have the class to use a glass container, or pre-portion them out in the back and have them neatly placed.  Hot food: Lamb was good and they had the basic prime rib which you can find at other places. All the other hot food was just okay or below my expectations. Yes, they do have lobster tails, but they were over cooked and hard which means you can only really eat one or 2 unless you like rubbery seafood.  Service: Fair to Average depending on the person. For the price of this buffet you would think it would be 5 star stellar and professional service.   There is all you can drink champagne included in the price, but I only had one glass. You can go to other buffets and get a champagne add on for way less than $85 total, so don't bother coming here just to get drunk on champagne. It's not worth it.  In summary, save your money as it's not even worth trying once in your life. Go to the Wicked Spoon buffet or the Wynn. Even Ballagio's is better than this one for less.  The only thing that this place has that the others don't are (1) overcooked lobster tail (2) endless champagne included in the price (3) caviar. Save your money and go buy caviar at the store and you will come out ahead and thankful.",

    "text": "If you are in Vegas and have $75 to blow on a schizophrenic lunch you might want to check out the Sterling Brunch at the Bally's Hotel and Casino!  ($100 after tax and tip)  \"Huh, did he just say SCIZO?\"  - YES I DID. Did I just pay $75 for a freaking buffet? - YES I DID. Did I get a recommendation from other Yelpers prior - YES I DID.  Anyway, back to the story: The Sterling Brunch is one of those hidden gems in Vegas that not a lot of people know about.  It occurs only once per week on Sunday and it is cleverly hidden inside the Steak House so those buffet trotting families will remain none-the-wiser.  Most of the customers proudly displayed their \"Britishness\" by thoroughly challenging every normal word while still speaking English-proper.  As soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a classy place.  The Maitre d' is dressed in an all black tux with a matching bow-tie.  We came in shorts and T-shirts and it was admittedly overwhelming at first.  That is, until you noticed that EVERYONE else was casual as well.  (OK so now you see why it is SCIZO?).  Of course, everyone here just wants to know about the food.  Honestly, for a buffet its pretty good.  But, I either LOVED or HATED whichever dish I got.  The Encrusted Chillean Sea Bass, Caviar, Perrier Jouet champagne, Crab claws, and desserts were primo in my books.  However, I found the lamb shanks, top sirloin strips, and Alaskan King Crab legs to be sub par for a buffet of this type.  The sushi was much better at Makino on Decatur so don't even bother.  Was it worth it?  YES - the champagne and caviar alone justified the expense.  Oh, and if you haven't tried \"Nagasaki\" saki you might want to give it a try as it was very drinkable.  However, I remain amused that some marketing guy would name the drink after a city that we bombed - how intelligent.  SERVICE: AAA, but you still had to get your own food (remember - it is a buffet).  I did, however, have a slight peave that they ended the buffet at 2:30 promptly and asked us to leave by 4:00 pm.  A few of my buddies and I were just looking to hang around and make good conversation but everyone working just wanted to end their shifts.  Completely understandable and possibly even our fault - but it did ruin the evening nonetheless.  So be forewarned - get there early.  VERDICT: If you have an ADD personality, love caviar and champagne, and can put up with a few nuances it is DEFINITELY an experience worth trying.    If you've ever spent a week on the gorge-fest of a boat Celebrity Cruise Lines you'll be sorely disappointed at the Sterling Buffet.  If you think $75 is a lot of money for lunch then go to the Wynn buffet... you'll spend half as much and still think it was expensive.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch, did not have a reservation. The are inside the BLT inside Barry's hotel. Got there around 11 and got on the waitlist. I would say the wait would have been 2 to 2 and half hours but a nice guy let us take his spot of the list cause he had to go. We got seated around 12:30. They send you a text when a spot opens up at the bar. There's about 20 seats and two bartenders acting as servers. They are a little overworked, probably could have used another server since they have to constantly be pouring champagne, making drinks, adding people to the waitlist, and taking plates. You could tell they were working very hard but it was just too much work.   The food overall I would say is a higher quality than any other buffet on the strip. There are much fewer options maybe only about 20-30 dishes but each one is made with pretty expensive ingredients. It's like they took the most expensive stuff buffets usually have and then added some more stuff in. For instance there is lobster (ofc), oysters, two types of crabs, filet mignon, caviar, and unlimited champagne. I would say it is definitely worth the $99 price tag. My bf and I's bill came out to be $270 with tax and tip.   The lobster was alright, a taaad dry but still quite good and easy to eat because they already separate the meat from the tail shell. These aren't dinky little lobsters either, they are really big lobster tails. The caviar was nothing special, kinda just tasted salty? The nigiri was actually reallyyy good. Like top quality, something you would order in a nice sushi restaurant. I've certainly had worse that I have paid more for. It was mostly yellowtail and salmon along with some rolls I didn't try.   The crab legs were pretty good, you can ask for crab crackers cause the king crab legs are quite spiky. The rock crab claws were very hard to open and every time I cracked one shell flew everywhere so I stopped after like 3. Oysters were sadly not very fresh, I was not a fan but I still had like 6 and I didn't get sick so I guess they were fine. They had filet mignons in little skillets, I thought they were ok but my bf ate 6 so obviously he thought they were top notch. They also had lobster bisque, lobster ravioli, and lobster you could get in an omelet. The omelet was quite good.   The meat from their carving station was fine but nothing too amazing. Their prawns were giant and excellent. They also had some regular food like waffles and chicken which I didn't bother trying. Their popover bread is quite good and the butter than comes with it is delicious so I would recommend asking for that.   Lets be real I just ate as much lobster as I could and seafood and basically ignored everything else.   Dessert was fine. Nothing too special but overall pretty good.   I would recommend coming here at least once just to experience eating ayce lobster and the classy environs. Try to get a res and if you can't try to come at early as you can to get on the waitlist for a shorter wait time.",

They have all the typical selections of a buffet aside from lobster tail and filet mignon which most buffets don't carry. There is definitely an increase in the quality and presentation of their selection compared to other buffets. I would say it is worth the $100 per person if you take advantage of the meat and seafood and champagne.",

If you know you will be going to Vegas in advance, I recommend making a reservation because it would be so much more nicer than going on the waitlist.  Once you check in, they will give you a glass of champagne while you wait for your table.  It should take about 5 - 10 minutes to be seated.   If you do not have reservations, you can go to one of the waiters at the bar, to be added on the waitlist.  They will take your number down so you can kill some time gambling or walking around the hotel.  Love love love these dishes: Lobster Tail  Lamb Alaskan Crab Legs Mashed Potatoes French Toast!!!!!  Filet Mignon  Shrimp Cocktails   TIP: The brunch ends at 2:30pm.  I recommend if you're there towards the end of the brunch, to grab your desserts before they start to run out of the better desserts :) Must try the chocolate covered strawberries!!! I'm pretty disappointed of the dessert bar especially if you're about to pay over $100 for brunch... I think I liked the fruits, yogurt, and the French toast better than the desserts.. which is pretty sad because I love love love sweets.   The only two reasons, I did not give this brunch place 5 stars because the sushi and dessert selection was not that great but other than that, I would definitely come back again! :)",

    "text": "So I've been stalking the reviews for this brunch for a couple months now. I don't think your normal Vegas buffet goer here's much about this place due to the exclusivity and price point of this buffet. First off, it's only open on Sundays for brunch / lunch. You should probably book a reservation in advance, but there are opportunities to wait in line and see if you can get seated. It's located inside the BLT steak house inside of Bally's so it has normal dining room seating and bar seating. Your best bet, if you don't have a reservation, is to wait in line then sprint to the bar area ha. The couple next to us said they had to adjust their Vegas trip date so they didn't have a reservation and so they got there 2 hours early. WOW, that's some dedication.  Service, similar to a steakhouse, you are going to get pretty good service. Our server was good, and kept the champagne flowing. Pierre Jouet. I am not much of a champagne drinker, but sounds like most people love it.  High level plus and minuses: +Atmosphere +Service +Quality / freshness +Seafood +Beef +Limited number of guests  -Limited options -Price point  A more in depth listing of foods I tried on this visit:  Above average Lobster - hugeeeeeee juicy lobsters, very good, I only ate 2 though  King Crab legs - probably the best thing at the buffet. They were decent size, but damn I am too lazy to crack them. If they were cracked, I would have eaten another pound probably  Lobster ravioli - a nice sauce and lobster oozing ravioli  Potato dishes - they have two, both are very cream and delicious  Lobster bique - also very rich and creamy, wish they could do a spin on it with a lot of lobster chunks in there, that's ok though, you can add your own!!  Popvers - i think it's like a gruyere brioche. Really good, but don't fill up on this. If this were like a menu item at a breakfast place I would eat this as my meal.  Average  Sushi, salad, and desserts. Nothing to write home about. I would probably steer clear of these fillers.   Since I am the number one value reviewer in the game, it's hard to wrap your head around a $100+ buffet. If you are so so eater, if you don't love seafood, I wouldn't come here. If you dine at steakhouses or seafood places regularly and want to eat til you throw up, I would come here!",

The shrimp cocktail were a bit watery and I just can't do oyster when they're left out like this.  They should offer cooked oysters maybe rockafeller.  The lobster tail was a bit bland and the butter needed salt but it is still worth it",

    "text": "After talking about going here for years, I went with my family to this brunch. Our expectations were high due to the YouTube videos we watched, however we were not as impressed.   Pros: The service was excellent and if you want to order eggs benedict, sorbet or ice cream you must do that through your server. I personally like caviar so that was my highlight but make sure you request them ice cold because the ones sitting out get warm and soggy. They are amazing with the blini and toppings. The champagne was great and paired well with the caviar and the herb crusted rack lamb was delicious. Also the chocolate covered strawberries were high quality, almost as if it were made by Godiva. I requested some sorbet as a palate cleanser and was given a refreshing coconut sorbet.   Cons: The bread popovers were undercooked inside making them have a raw dough taste, the king crab legs were a bit over salted, the lobster tails had a mediocre taste and texture, the filet mignon was much more rare to blue inside and very soft but lacked in seasoning and flavor, the lobster ravioli was a bit doughy and the sauce was over powering, and the oysters were filled with sand grit. The selection is very limited here and the food space was very small.   It was a decent experience and I ate and drank my worth in caviar and champagne, but they just raised the price from $105 to $125 per person about 8 months ago. This was a once in a lifetime experience for us and the quality was not up to par so I don't think I'll give this place a chance again.",

Both experiences are similar. If you are more into a private intimate brunch then make a reservation but the bar servers are great.  Definitely must try the special omelette. Caviar is great. Lobster is cooked to perfection and their bloody Mary mix is the best I have ever had. I am not a champagne drinker but the champagne makes a great mimosa. The only thing that I definitely think should be removed from the buffet is the airline chicken (dry and doesn't measure up to everything's else at the buffet.",

    "text": "Most know that it takes about three months to get reservations to Sterling. It's all you can eat lobster, Lamb chops, caviar, all you can drink champagne, pop overs and Bloody Mary bar. The most notable part of the brunch is by far is the service and the accommodations of the servers. The servers always top off your champagne at every minute that they get and are always there for any questions and cleaning the tables. The servers were worth every penny of this brunch experience. The most notable dishes at this brunch is their lobster, lamb chops, as well as their popovers that they serve in the beginning of your brunch. The champagne was mediocre not the best but then again I'm not a drinker myself. It was nice to know that the servers will top off your champagne the minute you take a drink from it. The pop overs were divine I would go back sit at the bar and just eat their pop overs. The lobsters were prepared perfectly nice and soft paired with their amazing butter. The lamb chops I could not get enough up.   One thing that I can note about this brunch experience is that it is quite expensive. You pay $125 per person without tax and tip. Now given that you can eat as much lobster as you want and caviar (which caviar was not something that I cared for) I would not come back to Sterling again. The food was OK but for the price that you pay the food was not as memorable. I mean the lobsters were great however you can make this yourself at home or order this at a restaurant that's probably going to cost you about $60-$75. Their made to order Benedict were just fine. They had a choice between a lobster Benedict and a fillet mignon Benedict we tried them both however we were just left with meh, it was fine. Now the service was amazing the bloody Mary bar was great however given the price I do believe that it's a one time thing that everyone should experience. I would give this about four stars given that the service is amazing the popovers were so delicious and there is all you can eat lobster.   Oh it is to note that there snow crab was mediocre to say the least. I thought they were serving king crab however it was really tiny and it appeared as if it was snow-crab. It was not fresh to say so the least as we all know all buffets serve seafood that are frozen. However the king crab was just not worth the expense of price.  I would not return to starling again I am happy that we as a family tried this brunch and we can say that we have been in the most expensive brunch in Las Vegas. I enjoyed the lobster and quite frankly I am done with lobster for quite some time I enjoyed their popovers and would love to have them all over again without having to pay the price of $125. I would recommend this place to my friends to have them experience the service and experience the feeling of eating as much lobster and caviar and champagne that they want. I just wish that they would focus more on some of their other dishes like their king crab, desserts most importantly, and some of the dishes were presented were subpar and lacked flavor. I think Sterling could do much better with their other dishes because quite frankly I would not come back here again just for the lobster.",

They were atypically slow and had a few open seats at the bar only when they opened at 9:30am. Chose a couple of seats at the bar where I could watch two TVs and NFL games and prepared for an epic feast. Our two bartenders were super friendly and provided awesome service.  Food wise, no complaints. I really didn't eat much other than lobster, lobster bisque, lobster benedict, a little  prime rib, and a bite of a few of the other entrees. Ate my share of lobster (4 tails) and drank enough champagne to probably cover my tab ($110 + tip). The lobster wasn't the best I have had, but was good, maybe a little undercooked. It tasted great regardless when diced up and eaten in the excellent lobster bisque. Prime rib was ok. Desserts were better than average for the typical buffet, not outstanding though. I would highly recommend the bananas Foster: ask your server to bring a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Overall, very good. If you are a big lobster fan and will stick with mainly eating lobster, you'll probably get your moneys worth.",

I was very pleased with all their food, Lobster tails, Crab legs, and champagne, it doesn't get any better than that, it's all you can eat but you only get like 2 hours to be there, it's enough time to eat but I usually like to take my time after brunch and just sit and talk, they might ask you leave! When we went we stayed there for almost 3 hours and they didn't say anything, we were don't eating after an hour, I mean how much can you really eat?  We just enjoy the champagne and the conversation. If you're on a budget don't go there, we are talk g about $150.00-170.00 per person before tipping out. The brunch itself it's like $120.00 so if you get a couple cocktails and plus the tip you're looking at $170.00 per person, but it's all worth it.  It's my new favorite brunch in Vegas!  Service is very personalized and the bread they serve it's too dangerous!!   You won't be disappointed!!",

Let just say is it WORTH $105 PP??? I DON'T think  so.. Seriously how many lobster tails can a person eat?? After 3, I'm all lobster out  and the king crab legs was good.  Bank for your buck?? NO, i think it should be around $70 pp is more justifiable.  How can a steak house NOT have A1 steak sauce?? The beef were not good at all, it's odd for steak house to not serve good steak, don't u think?? Probably my least fav.  The sea bass, lobster bisque, banana foster, pop over were my  favourite.    Desserts are limited BUT still NOT good.. why???  I love my desserts more than anything, and they look so cute when it's mini desserts(yes, I'm a sucker for anything minis) hehe!!   But nothing was spectacular for me and hubby to say WOW we are definitely coming back.. try it once and it's good enough.. now move on to the next buffet.",

The Alaskan king crab is spectacular! It tastes like cane sugar. It's amazing. That being said the shell is very difficult to remove. It isn't hard so it won't break easily. It is very rubbery. But inside is the best king crab ever!!!   The desserts are great. They have a cake pop that's phenomenal. It's chocolate inside and peppermint nutmeg outside. So good. The fruit cups are so yummy and fresh.  The popover bread is to DIE FOR!!so good!! Warm and amazing. I would pay for the brunch for the popover alone tbh. So good.

Their selections are limited compared to grand buffets, but boy, do them focus on those items! That's all they need, and they are good! They've got a whole separate dessert selection that I didn't have much room for.   Starting from the left side, there's a maki station that you pick a small plate of your choice that typically consist of 2 maki rolls. There's also popular caviar (based on Yelp reviews) so don't miss them! Walking along, there's the salad (ahem, for those who want to eat some salad as you eat- I'd totally skip it), berries, and some breakfast selection.  Towards the center are best stuff you should focus on. Lobster tails, crab legs, prime beef. To the right of it are potatos, steak, asparagus, and cold seafood station with oysters, stone crabs, and shrimp cocktails. There're condiments for those, hot butter, cocktail sauce, lemon, and etc.   I immediately focused on the center, as stated above, and didn't get to eat much else. I was TOO FULL to eat so much. Did I eat $100 worth of stuff, I'm not sure, but I did manage 3 lobster tails! :) I, of course, left like my stomach was ready to pop out, drunk from those champagne, didn't feel like walking nor take a nap; I simply didn't know what I wanted to do because I was miserably full. I can't remember when's the last time I ate that much. Probably never.   When they say unlimited pours of Perrier Jouet champagne, they are not kidding. They are very generous with it.   Go ahead, make those reservations in advance. Don't sit there and contemplate. Just do it!",

Lobster tails tasted microwaved. The meat was good. Sushi and caviar were low quality. If you NEED lobster tails in Vegas, ok go to sterling. If you just want a great Vegas buffet, stick to wicked spoon and bacchanal.   It's fine. But you have so many great options for a meal in Vegas don't waste your time here.",

The brunch serves endless champagne, filet minot, king crab, lamb chops, lobster tails roasted in cognac, caviar, pop-ups, just to name a few items.  I eat the brunch every visit to Las Vegas, it's a highlight during every visit.   It's fairly expensive, but worth every penny.  You must try this dinning experience once in a lifetime.",

    "text": "Not sure why the Sterling Brunch didn't get a whole new page once they changed over from Bally's Steakhouse to BLT as previous ratings are now irrelevant with an entirely new restaurant doing Vegas' best Brunch...but in comparing the old to the new, here's what I noticed:  LOBSTER: Bigger and more tender here than before. Had some rubbery tails in the past, especially towards the end of the Bally's Steakhouse reign. KING CRAB: Same, great quality as before FILET MIGNON: Better at the old Bally's...now they have individual filet trays rather than slicing it off a larger cut of meat to your color preference. If you want rare or medium rare, you are out of luck, everything I tried was medium well. The herb butter on top was nice though. RACK OF LAMB: Thick and meaty as they were before, excellent quality but lacked a little seasoning...had to make use of the green jelly and German mustard. SERVICE: Waiters were excellent as always, glasses of champagne never half full. However, this one lady behind the buffet was putting this bread pudding french toast from one pan into another with both pans out next to each other and I asked her which pan had the freshly made ones as I wanted to grab one...and she looked at me blankly without an answer...so I asked again, \"Which ones were the ones made 45 minutes ago and which ones were the ones made 5 minutes ago as I'd want a fresh one\"...again she looked at me like I had horns and gave me a weird look. She wasn't a foreigner who couldn't speak English and I'm paying $235 for 2 people to eat breakfast, she just wanted to act miserable. Ok, thanks. LOBSTER BISQUE: Wasn't anywhere to be found...noooo! I like my lobster bisque. Actually no soup to be found anywhere. POPOVERS: Awesome, made absolutely perfect. A new addition...watch you don't fill up. SUSHI: They used to have cuts of sashimi without having to take any rice, now it's nigiri on rice...I can have that anywhere for 1/5 the cost...avoided it. The free sake was nice though, wasn't too strong and had a nice flavor. DESSERTS: They looked great in color, but they just didn't taste great...I was actually shocked that the apricot panna cotta had a NON-DAIRY whipped topping on top...that's a low grade stations buffet move. In the past they had the best home made vanilla bean ice cream I ever had in my life and I used to put it on top of freshly made crepes. Now it's just pink cake pops and blue macaroons trying to look lovely. I would put the dessert section of 10 other buffets well ahead of this one with Bachannal leading the pack. A bit of a bummer at $95 a person plus tax and tip to be disappointed at the finish line. Now I know to have more lobster.  In conclusion, you're eating rack of lamb, filet mignon, king crab and lobster, all done pretty well. Throw in unlimited Perrier-Jouet and unlimited top shelf cocktails and this one is still the one to beat. Fix that dessert situation and serve your french toast with a smile for a 5 star bump.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to check this place out as I try to go to a brunch buffet every time in Vegas. I can say this is definitely the best brunch buffet spot right now in Las Vegas (this overtakes the now defunct jasmine brunch in the Bellagio... I'm still mourning at its lost). This brunch is in its own class!  + top quality food items that tops other brunches + lobster tail! + unlimited champagne + good ambience and service  - pricey so not for everyone  Location:  is inside the Ballys resort and hotel. Parking is shared with Paris hotel and it connects both. The sterling brunch is located in the BLT steakhouse. This place had a recent renovation and he restaurant definitely is classy looking, much more then the casino itself.   Food: This is the highlight. This place has all high end food items and no other buffet compares in terms of quality, as it should for a price point of 90 per person (85 per person if you sign up for a free total rewards card). Drinks are included in his brunch, including brut champagne! Does not include bloody Mary's.   My favorite food items include the sea bass, filet mug in, Alaskan king crab, jumbo shrimp cocktail, the rack of lamb with chimichurri sauce and lobster tail. Yes gigantic pacific lobster tail is part of this buffet! Other items include made to order omelettes with lobster, caviar, sushi, cold items, charcuterie, prime rib and so much more. The overall selection is less the places like Bacchanal and wicked spoon, however his can be a good thing because they have a lot of blister dishes, while this brunch can concentrate making its more limited menu fantastic.  You also get a fresh batch of their freshly baked popovers which are some of the best popovers I've had (beats Jordan pond in Maine), however be careful because they can fill you up. They tasted great dipped with the lobster bisque.   Dessert great selection of mini pastries such as chocolate mousse, chocolate covered strawberries, macaroons, cake pops, and tarts. Their brioche bread pudding French toast with bananas foster is perhaps he best French toast I've ever had that I qualify it as a dessert. There are multiple layers to the bread that are crispy on the edges and the insides soak up the sweet syrup. Perfection!  Service: Our waiter was excellent. He was attentive and made sure our plates were take away when done and our drinks were filled. Overall great experience.",

    "text": "So I'm going to give my honest opinion about the brunch, I personally thought it was overpriced for the options they had. Yes you do get unlimited champagne which if you enjoy that's great, I don't really care for it myself. You did get an unlimited selection of drinks as well which is pretty good if you want something specific. As for the food, the pictures posted here versus what I saw in person are completely different. I didn't see many of the menu items seen on previous posts. There was an endless amount of lobster tails and crab legs which is great, but other then that you only get a few other options of meat. The salmon didn't taste like anything, the filet mignon was very dry, and also the chicken was a bit flavorless. The caviar was pretty tasty, didn't try any sushi but it looked good and the dessert bar was a sad excuse to be called one. All in all, I would have felt better about spending my money elsewhere, but the point was for us to try it and we personally thought it was hyped up.  I wouldn't come again. The service was nice but the food was eh.",

    "text": "This is the Mack Daddy of all Buffets/AYCE in Vegas!!! But... But... But.. It's very spendy.. To the tune of $90 a person (80 with a TR card) however is well worth it if you like to eat posh. What I mean is if you don't eat caviar, lobster, king crab or drink the bubbly for breakfast then you will be wasting your money and shouldn't bother coming here. However, you get what you pay for here; the champagne served alone was worth the entry fee.   Unlike the feed lines at the other casino buffets, this place does require reservations. I suggest that you do it at least week in advance as this place is always busy.  The Food: The buffet line was superb! Lobster tail, filet mignon, prime rib, lamb and king crab: a feast fit for a king! The table menu boded items like lobster benedict, french toast, tuna tartare and caviar. We were unsure what to get from the kitchen so the server grabbed a sample of offerings for our first round of the aforementioned delicacies.   Everything that I ate was top notch with excellent service to match! We were tended to with excellent service, never had a champagne glass empty or a dirty dish in sight.   This was definitely a memorable dining experience that should be near the top of everyone's to-eat list in Vegas.   Eat with Confidence (pinkies up)",

    "text": "I went to the Sterling Brunch yesterday to give it a try before the Bally's Steakhouse closes.  They are not sure if the Sterling Brunch will be continued.  Things seem to be in limbo right now.  About a month ago, I made a reservation on Open Table when I learned of the uncertain future.  I arrived a bit early but there was no problem.  I was seated quickly after the hostess checked by Total Rewards card.  There is a small reduction in price with the TR card.  She handed me off to a maitre d' who escorted me to my table.  There I was introduced to my server, John, with whom I shared some laughs and comments and from whom I received superb service.  I wasn't there for the unlimited champagne which John was about to pour when I stopped him.  Instead, I asked him for some tomato juice.  He was back in a flash with a good sized glass of tomato juice.  I then made my first trip into the side room where the brunch is set up in chafing dishes on tables.  I found the one with the lobsters and got one.  I added to this a nice petit filet mignon and a lamb chop cut from a rack of lamb that was nicely rare.  The lobster tails (all four of them) were very good and quite good considering they had been grilled and were sitting in a chafing dish.  I was surprised by how tasty the filet was and how medium rare it was again given that it had been broiled and was in a chafing dish.  The second foray was for two more lobster tails and some caviar.  Now you know why I came to the Sterling Brunch.  It was the lobster but there was a good selection of brunch items besides the lobster.  My third trip was for another lobster tail.  I also got some jumbo peeled shrimp, a small amount of lox, and a half yellow tomato stuffed with crab salad.  My last two trips were for dessert to round out the experience.  The last dessert was a made to order fresh fruit crepe with whipped cream, some more fruit and some chocolate sauce.  A few things about the buffet.  The butter for the lobster and crab is melted and kept in a teapot like container.  As needed, the worker fills the small jars with butter.  The butter should be a lot warmer than it is.  It should be stored in a heated compartment and we could get our own.  It's nice to pick up a glass and go but when it's below standard, that's not the best answer.  There was so much more that I could have tried.  I skipped all the sashimi, the salads for the most part, and some the breakfast foods.  After eating four lobster tails, there wouldn't be a lot of room for those frills.  One thing that marked the brunch was the outstanding service and attitude of the servers and bussers.  Everyone was efficient, polite, had a nice smile, and were very friendly.  If you got a made to order omelette, you didn't wait.  You got your other things and it's brought to your table.  That's just how they do things.  The steakhouse is a classic Las Vegas one.  Lots of wood, booths, and a couple of small tables like the one I was at.  I noted the amount of champagne that was being poured and I heard John tell another customer that they averaged over a bottle per person.  He also would go to the kitchen and bring some special requests to tables.  That's just how the service was.  I  think I'll do this again if it continues and I'll have some of the other foods and cut back on the lobster.  After all, I had no oysters either.  I must be slipping!",

Food - besides the 2 shortcomings mentioned above all the food was 5 star.  Usually when you go to a Buffett you have a few bites and are ready for the next selection. At this Buffett every selection is good enough to eat a whole servings worth.  Beverage  - champs on champs on champs! You can go to the bar and keep drinking champagne even if you are finished eating at your table.  Score!  Atmosphere - it's in the existing BLT restaurant yet has a cool, exclusive vibe.

My favorite was the Lobster (I had 2), Chilean Sea Bass, Prime Rib, Alaskan King Crab, and Lamb Chops. I love to eat and just had to stuff myself (needless to say didn't need to eat for the rest of the day). Just take your time eating and there is absolutely no rush.

    "text": "Heavily clad in silver when it opened its doors to high rollers in 1981, Bally's Sterling Brunch has undergone a few changes in the last thirty-four years, but still considered a piece of classic Las Vegas on the 'you've got to do it once' list for locals and tourists alike a visit on the Sunday preceding Memorial Day showed the place to be still going strong even despite a doubling in price across the three decades past.  Undeniably a pricey experience, currently tallying $90 but justified by its boutique nature with all-you-can drink Champagne plus a spread including Grilled Lobsters, American Caviar, and King Crab Legs that far outshine the meager offerings at overwrought spots elsewhere, arrival at the doors of BLT Steak during service is likely to be met by a short line but with reservations the wait is minimal, my 9:30am arrival seeing me seated within five minutes by a GM who showed great skill in memorizing the names of diners at several tables where he checked in frequently.  Doing my best to snap a few photos before the buffet was in full swing before returning to my table to find a young waitress that was soon to be overstretched in serving more than a dozen tables, it was with champagne and coffee glass filled that the details of the dining room were described and soon given an enormous cheesy pop-over plus whipped butter by a tall male back-server the experience was underway, the airy bread exceedingly wispy beneath a soft golden shell with cheesy top-notes so pronounced that it almost led me to request another - until I recalled what treasures were to come.  Acknowledging my limitations as relates to alcohol, and as such imbibing in only two-and-a-half glasses of Perrier Jouet along with at least three-fold as many refills of coffee during the course of my 175 minute stay, it was with a deliberate pace and path that I worked my way through the buffet's offerings, a first plate featuring the restaurant's heralded omelet prepped to order with 2oz of caviar, a trio of blinis, and a nicely grilled lobster tail plus freshly drawn butter at its side.  Generally underwhelmed by buffet seafood, but immediately impressed by both the lobster as well as the caviar, a second trip saw snappy shrimp set beside another tail, more roe, plus two types of crab and although the cold pre-cracked claws were a little more grainy than I'd have hoped the King Crab was as sweet and succulent as most found in fine dining establishments spanning the strip, a follow-up of benedicts from the kitchen taking far too long to prepare and meagerly decorated with protein when compared to what customers can just as easily gather themselves.  Taken by the delicacy of noodles surrounding lobster ravioli topped in a sauce quite similar to the bisque, but richer when thickened by hot cast iron, and more than a little surprised at just how supple the slab bacon was when sliced to order, it was here that sweets would first be sampled and although the miniature waffles topped with whipped cream and macerated fruit plus a drizzle of maple syrup were a nice balance of crisp, pliable, and yeasty the laminated pastry given a custard bath before being baked into French Toast was an absolute show-stopper, easily amongst the best in the city and far superior to many that cost $17-20 at several 24-hour cafes.  Spending some time admiring decorations fashioned from reappropriated utensils, the restaurant now nearing half-full with several inebriated patrons pushing the noise level to a dull roar, it was unfortunate that neither the flimsy bacon nor run-of-the-mill sausage were any better than that available at a neighborhood diner while the tiny slice of filet mignon was almost inedibly cooked past well-the tender lamb chops as well as stuffed chicken proving far better seasoned and prepared on my final plate of savories before rounding out the experience in to a quartet of plates featuring small desserts, fruits, cheeses, and nuts.  At this point losing track of the server who seemed to be covering half the room, it was to the GM that I appealed for another cup of coffee and tasting through each of the sweets presented from the bar up front only two items really stood out - the hazelnut tart for its ability to reinvent Nutella into an ever-so-light mousse and the Cheesecake whose sour thickness was absolutely the opposite, a far better bite found in a small bowl of grilled peaches and candied bacon atop fresh pulled burrata that sat unannounced on the cold bar next to an equally fresh berry and yogurt parfait.  Without a doubt an experience, the quality of the cuisine and beverages easily justifying the cost for fans of shellfish and those capable of drinking their fair share of bubbly brut, Sterling Buffet lived up to its 'bucket list' billing as one of those places that everyone should try once, the impetus to return a matter of tastes and budget, particularly in a city where far more vast spreads can be found at a mere fraction of the cost.",

    "text": "This place is as insane as the other reviewers say with regards to the lobster being good size and what you should be expecting if you are paying 90$ pre tax and tip for a bottomless buffet. They give you bottomless champagne (a pretty decent one imo) I forgot the name of. You can order some things directly, all included in the price, such as lobster eggs bennedict or a regular one. The buffet itself has about 25 items, mainly seafood (lobster tails, king crab, oyster) and meats (filet mignon - medium rare amazingness it was truly $$$$ worthy, AMAZINGLY soft and tender bacon, lamb and prime rib which i did not try) As this place is located inside BLT Steak, a well known expensive steakhouse I would expect the taste to be out of this world and it truly was.  The reason I dock a star is because 90$ I think is still too steep when you have 55$ at Caesar's which is a close second when it comes to quality but obviously no lobster tails, filet mignons, etc) but their variety is literally 3-4x. Sterling dessert though is also comparable to a pretty amazing college dining hall dessert experience. So while it is pretty great in terms of the small bites, Caesar's is just so much better and much more variety. For example there is no ice cream or gelato here, and even a dining hall would have that...Anyhow I still would recommend for you to try it once just to see what the fuss is about, but in the future probably stick to Caesars.",

I couldn't get a reservation for my hubby and me, but we were lucky that we got seated at the bar without having to wait at all. The service was pretty good. Both bartenders working there were very nice and attentive.   The food section was really small and somewhat disappointing. The lobsters were hit and miss -- for the first round, I got two lobsters along with caviar, crab legs and lobster bisque, both lobsters were cooked to just right. Though they needed a bit of seasoning, they were pretty tasty. But the third one that I got later was way overcooked and rubbery. Everything else that I tried was also somewhat over cooked, except for the lobster ravioli, it was delicious.  For drinks, I got champaign and orange juice, thinking to make some mimosa. Unfortunately, the OJ that they served wasn't good, which kind of spoiled it.   I don't think I  ate the money worth of food, which probably would always be the case with buffets, even at the Sterling Brunch. But the experience was nice to have.",

To prepare for Sterling Brunch my boyfriend and I dieted for a solid week so we could thoroughly enjoy the decadent delights this buffet had to offer. He even brought up YouTube videos on how properly to eat at this buffet. Yes folks there are tutorials on it. As mentioned in the previous Yelp reviews this brunch is gourmet and features lobster tails, king crab legs, lamb chops, prime rib, sushi, caviar. The mashed potatoes were the best I ever tasted. Our waiter told us they make it with blue cheese.  Another must have is the lobster bisque. Just delicious. The cheese souffle our waiter brought us courtesy of the chef was wonderful. It had a fruit type sauce over the top of it. The desserts were all elegantly displayed. The fruit torts were excellent but unfortunately didn't have much room for dessert after all the delicious offerings. Sure it's over the top extravagant gluttony but it's Vegas and we wouldn't want it any other way!",

    "text": "To be completely honest, Buzzfeed brought me here. (We even had the same servers featured in the video)  Reservations were made three months in advance for our group of four which is kind of unheard of for a buffet; but when you're only open one day a week and identify as the best buffet in Las Vegas, it is bound to peak your interest right?  With that being said, I would give Sterling a firm B- overall. I was surprised that Sterling did not have a location of their own and instead occupies Bally's BLT Steak on Sunday mornings nor was I really expecting a smaller, dimly lit ambiance as your standard buffet aesthetic. But the service was  undeniably impeccable, Roxanne was the most attentive & personable waitress I have ever had at a buffet. She was always there at every sip of Perrier and was kind enough to offer her advice about her favorite buffet items. Foodwise though, I would have to say that Sterling did not completely dazzle me; while the food was pretty well-cooked, the menu was exponentially smaller than I expected at $99 a seat. Rather than describing it as a buffet, I felt like it was more like a pre-set plated brunch made for 50 people at a time. I also felt like I was constantly waiting for food to be reset rather than immediately picking items for my plate. In the end though, I was still content with my experience; perhaps my expectations were just set too high. Worth-wise, I would suggest Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon at half the rate.  If you are curious to try though, I would definitely do Sterling at least once because the lobster ravioli and their mouth watering popovers were very unforgettable.",

    "text": "I'm a fan, indeed. Especially of the fancy schmancy Perrier-Jouet champagne that kept on going and going. So, for those not in the know, this is a Sunday morning only brunch buffet at Ballys, and it comes with quite the pricetag: $85 per person (about $110/person after tax, tip and such). ...and it's by reservation, so you've gotta plan ahead.  And it is pretty fancy schmancy in there. Not in the modern, Wynn/Encore sorta way, but in the 1955 sorta way.. with waiters in white dinner coats and green striped wallpaper. The food selection is supposed to be amazing, and I concur (mostly), it wasn't bad.  Despite what my profile may say about lobster, the lobster here was actually my favorite thing. ...or maybe it was just the butter I doused it in. Either way, it was one tasty dish. I also tried caviar for the first time, and it wasn't bad, but nothin' to write home about.   There were crab claws, but not crab legs. There's filet mignon that you can get from the tray, but I recommend asking your waiter for them to cook some to order for you. Other than that, I had some delicious lamb chops, a delish pretzel roll and some pretty decent dessert.   The real highlight is the service. Even though the buffet is self-serve, our waiter was ON it. I never had an empty champagne glass, and he gladly got our filet mignons to order.   The ultimate test though... would I go again? Nope. It was worth an experience, but I'm pretty sure I'm just as satisfied (and probably because I'm not a huge lobster fan) with the Spice Market or Wynn buffets.",

    "text": "this one def. lives up to its name and price. I went here sunday's regularly when i lived in vegas, and I now make sure to drop by the last day in town when visiting. The setting is a bit claustrophobic; however, the service is always grand/friendly and the buffet is classy. I personally fancy the small room b/c it omits the need for the awkward walk of shame back to the seat @ most buffets, but I have had some awkward, back-to-back chair-knocking issues here in the past.  Of note: try the cognac omelets, if they're on special, at the chef station. Whatever's on special, they never go wrong here. The lobster bisque here is good enough.   Also, keep it light and stick to soft-shell crabs, etc., instead of filet mignon, etc.... unless you're obese or whatnot. Trust me, you'll fill up very fast, though it's easy to forget you're at a buffet.   Last but not least, save room for dessert!!! They have amazing white chocolate ganaches, white choc.-covered strawberries and fruit tarts. I tend to eat equal parts dinner n dessert, lol. My fav. part of this meal is sipping on way too much champagne and catching up w/ pals above consuming a pound or 10 of dessert.",

I didn't have that \"gee, I totally missed that section\" regret. It's not a large buffet actually but I actually did over hear people saying they didn't notice certain sections.  The food was wonderful, they had selections like caviar and lobster which you don't find at buffets like Bellagio or Wynn. To be honest though it wasn't the food that blew me away, it was the service and the constant flow of champagne that won me over :-) To be honest I didn't expect to get \"buzzed\" so early in the morning but those servers are like ninjas when it came to keeping my glass topped! At the end of the gluttonous extravaganza I walked out feeling full, giddy and very loved when the host went out of his way to make sure I walked out with a lovely rose :-) I will return...but next time I will keep a eye on my glass and not let myself get too giddy that early on a sunday ;-)",

    "text": "Sifting through all the reviews and food show hype, Bally's Sterling Brunch was pegged as probably the best Sunday brunch around.  Located in the casino at the site of their steak house, the Sterling Brunch exudes a classy old-school style of dining.  Their selection of items can only be described as no-frills with many of the classic brunch staples that have withstood the test of time and found almost everywhere.  But this is where the similarity with many other brunches ends.  The caliber of items for an AYCE place is superior.  Who offers unlimited lobster tail, filet mignon, and caviar, with bottomless Perrier-Jouet champagne?   They have the standard omelette station, crepe station, waffles, etc.    I don't want to go into an exhaustive listing so I will just point out some of the noteworthy things.  Australian rock lobster tail - you can pile it on, not just take one please filet mignon - tender casino clams caviar - not sure which but not cheap kind, mildly salty and not too fishy prime rib rack of lamb - cooked perfect seafood jambalaya garlic truffle mashed potatoes salmon egg benedict seafood in puff pastry couscous with tilapia dessert bar - choc dipped strawberries, various cream desserts in glasses, choc brownie with peanut butter on a stick  Stay away from: sushi - not so fresh and a bit fishy crab claws - mushy  They have bacon and sausage but no eggs.  Omelette bar though. No crab legs.  If you like to have a variety of different foods and novel offerings, this brunch may not be for you. There is no chocolate fountain either.  Service is impeccable.  One server per two tables.  Constant attention to your needs.  Nice change of pace to other Vegas buffets that tend to be a bit mediocre in quality.    PS - I have to share a conversation at the dessert bar with a girl, I'll call her Bimbo, and her friend.  As she looks at the long stem choc covered strawberries, she remarks - OMG how do they do that!?    The dessert bar guy   - Oh they dip it one chocolate and then drizzle the other one over, creating the stripes.  Bimbo - No, I meant the stems, how do they make them so long?  I then looked at the dessert guy and he was in shock. I was more than thrilled to help out.  Me - Oh, they don't create it.  They just cut the strawberry with stem longer cuz it grows on a plant!  Bimbo - Wow. Who knew? (giggles)  What I would have liked to have replied - If you were a zebra, you would be the first to be eaten by the lions, but you're not. So please, do us all a favor and don't have any children unless they discover stupidity skips generations.",

    "text": "Ok..... Unlike any other yelp reviews I've done I will keep this shorter than usual but as serious as possible......  hmmmm.......  Sterling Brunch is gotta be one of my favorite buffets in all North America.  (Taiwan has some awesome ones but Yelp is not there yet)  Sterling Brunch is located in Bally's Las Vegas and is only available on Sundays from 9:00am - 2:00pm (Typically by reservations only but you may get lucky)    They got the typical buffet fare ranging from various seafood, poultry, steaks, desserts.  Here's the list:  Seafood:  clam, mussels, salmon (sashimi/cooked), oysters, lobsters, fatty tuna, Uni, king crabs, and  Cavier!  (So the sashimi is flown in from Japan weekly, Lobster are baked half of a 1-2 lbs lobsters, and Cavier is all you can indulge!!!  with those little blintz to go with it! YUM!)  Poultry and Steaks (meat):  rosemary roasted chicken, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, beef wellington, Beef Oscar (fancy!)  Dessert:  lots of melt in your mouth heavenly desserts that you simply cannot miss out on any of it...  Extras:  Lobster omelet, Gazpacho soup, fresh fruits, other seafood prepared cooked such as seafood Bouillabaisse, etc...  Had my favorite server \"Eduardo\"!  Awesome guy who worked at the Sterling Brunch for 30 years.... really nice guy who actually prepared us a seafood extravaganza on ice while we get our food!  Tipped Eduardo really good afterwards as he was like the best server we ever had!  (by the way you actually get 2 servers one helps you with everything else the other one make sure your drinks are always topped off perfectly!  Simply awesome!)  Of course.. with a meal like that.. it took us 3 hours to finish but of course that was enjoyed slowly....  Man.. lots of lost lobsters in my stomach and stuff.....Just way too much good stuff...........  Oh oh... get this.. while at Sterling I got this guy who was in front of me wanting Cavier... so when he got some from the nice little Japanese lady who was serving the fresh raw seafood he kept asking for more....The lady wasn't angry or anything but instead, took his plate, opened up a brand new like 120oz of cavier and literally slapped on top of the plate.... In a very nice way!!!  Everyone was floored when they saw that and the big man was a \"VERY\" happy customer....Seriously.. that Japanese lady was so nice she gave me a bunch of UNI after that as well!  LOL!  Shout out to Eduardo and Little Japanese lady...  Finally... forgot to mention... you want water... it's all Evian only.... FREE!  Then champagne is also complimentary.. which they served only Pierre Jouet!!!  WOW!!! I'm in heaven yelpers!!!  (That was also the reason why we were there for 3 hours.. had about 5 bottles of PJ for about $50 per bottle.....)  The cost is about $85 without Tax and tip.... but I'm telling you... BEST MEAL I'VE HAD EVER!!!!!!  Sterling Brunch.... I can't wait till the day we meet again..................",

Even the cheap buffet inside Harrah's is better than this (at least they have waffle cones!)  Even if I'm a whale of a gambler and get comp'd for this, I would have to think twice before stepping in.  Ambience: poor. flickering fluorescent light in one of the area Seafood: meh. all the other hotel buffets are so much better/fresher. friend got sick after Hot food: meh again.  Dessert: small selection and C quality compared to all the other buffets (Wynn, Belagio, etc)  i have no clue why anyone would go here when there's Wynn all those yummy buffets at half the price. The people who gave this place 4 or 5 stars seriously are not foodie's and must NOT have had the good buffets in vegas (or even just a nice brunch at Bouchon at Venetian!)   I have to admit, while other buffets are all similar in a good way and blur together in my head, this one was extra memorable because it was so bad.  (note: I was dragged here not by choice)",

After remodeling Bally's steakhouse has been changed to BLT restaurant with buffet atmosphere. NO more white tablecloth, no more white linen napkins. You are coming and can see a new , modern restaurant, nothing special, one of hundreds in Vegas.  Some guests were in shorts and flip flops. Less food, still good, the same champagne. You have to order caviar, can't take it by yourself. Somehow the desert table was much less than it was before, no more crepes with berries and cognac.  It's so different, so disappointing. Have to be honest the service is the same. Almost the same personnel that was there at Bally's Steakhouse. Fo r the price that they charge now $95 wouldn't recommend this buffet any more.",

    "text": "I have to say the only reason they got a 3, was because of the caviar and the price. Tip: If you look under 18 or 21, and you don't drink the champagne, the cost is only $30. (Even though they say that children's price is $50)        The caviar was good, obviously not top quality, but good enough to be worth the price.       However, the lobsters, oysters, and filet mignon were definitely not up to par. The lobsters, after seeing many good reviews online, I expected them to be tender and juicy. They were tender, but it was overcooked and was kind of tough. The oysters were the worst: not fresh AT ALL. It was also not shucked completely and was hard to get off the shell. They had no taste to them also. The filet mignon, looked beautiful, and would of tasted amazing if not for it was completely cold by the time I brought it to my table (even though it was sitting on a stone plate). One more thing, the smoked salmon was completely dry, probably because it had been out for long. Even the capers were hard and tasted like lemon seeds.        The service also, was okay only. Even though they were very attentive with refilling the champagne, they definitely was biased. Our server had always poured the last bits of the champagne and also were much nicer to certain people.         This place is definitely good if you're a fan of caviar and desserts, but for lobsters and mostly everything else they promote, it is either cold, tough, or not fresh. I don't think the food quality and service quality was worth $90.",

If you want all you can eat lobster tails, crab claws that are already cracked for you, rack of lamb, and unlimited bottles of good champagne, it doesn't get any better than this place.   Service was great. Our champagne flutes were always full. When I was at the meat cutting station asking for some lamb, the guy was like \"how many pieces do you want\". I don't recall ever being asked how much I want at any other buffet. They usually just give you some pathetically small serving and send you on your unmerry way. So I asked the dude for FIVE lamb chops, just to see his reaction.  Unfazed, he delivered and it was delicious.   At around $100 per person, this place ain't exactly a screaming value.  But after an entire rack of lamb, 5 lobster tails and an immeasurable number of crab claws, I gotta say, screw value.  Best brunch ever.",

The buffet is a lot smaller than before even with the items that are ordered from the kitchen. The filet, sea bass, lamb chops & lobster was lukewarm at best. The lobster didn't have any flavor & were tough (same as it was 4 years ago). The popovers probably would have been good had they at least been warm. The French toast was the hottest item from the stations & it was really good. I will give them 4 stars for the presentation but not the food or service. The wait was long to get plates cleared & he kept forgetting items from the kitchen or brought the wrong ones. The caviar is good & you definitely need to order a double amount since it comes from the kitchen (and in case you get a slow server like we did). I recommend the lobster Benedict from the kitchen. The king crab legs were very good albeit I had to use my napkin to hold onto them to crack them since the waiter kept forgetting to bring me the crackers. The rest was just ok. I have no plans on going back & if I do it will be a very long time. I was hoping for superb food & service due to the new place & $90 price (if u don't have a rewards number). Was extremely disappointed with both.",

The cashew nut crusted sea bass was unbelievably good. The roasted lobster tails can be a bit dry. Price is now 90 bucks a person. Service ( we had Lorena) was not too friendly but was pretty efficient  (This lady patron dressed in white attire for some reason decided to grace us with her presence. She went from her table to our table, stood in the corner and blew her snotty, wet mucous- y nose for a good 2 minutes (AT LEAST). It was so loud and disgusting and it was totally wet-sounding. Dude, why not do that in the restroom or do it at your own dang table you sicko!). Good thing we were just about done eating. Manners lady, manners.)",

    "text": "I was there at the Sterling's Sunday Brunch in mid August 2011.  Thought I try out the most expensive buffet in Vegas.  I was quite dissappointed.  First of all, I am a Veteran at the Vegas buffets.  I go to Vegas at least twice a year for the past 15 years and have eaten at every single buffet there is, including, but not limited to, Bellagio, Wynn, Rio, Flamingo, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesar's, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, MGM Grand, Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, Harrah's, Stratosphere, M Hotel, Aria, Cosmopolitan, etc...  Therefore, my expectation of the Sterling's Sunday Brunch was extremely high.  When I first walked in, I was very dissappointed with the small spread.  The decor was lacking as well.  Where is the ice sculpture as shown in their website?!?  Their website showed a large spread of food, including crab legs, bread, and an ice sculpture.  The buffet wasn't anything like in the website.  The most dissappointing part was the food.  There were no big Alaskan crab legs at the buffet.  The crab legs at the buffet table were hot, small, and rubbery.  You have to ask for the large ones.  You also have to ask for the caviar.  I found it lame that they would hide the food.   As for the sushi selection, it was lame.  Again, do I have to ask for the sashimi?  They had cheap items like California roll, etc.  As for the lobster, I had 2 and they were both overly cooked and rubbery.  As for the raw oysters, they only had about 10 at the buffet table and they were constantly running out.  The rack of lamb was tender but wasn't anything special.  The flavor was bland.  There were no giant shrimp coctails at the buffet table.  Maybe, like the crab legs, caviar, and everything else, you have to ask for them.  The service was poor as well.  When I asked for the food, the waiter kept telling me to go to the buffet table.  I had to ask the guy that cut the prime rib for the crab legs and had to ask the lady at the small sushi station for the caviar.  For the price of $85 per person, you can definitely get better food somewhere else like at the Bellagio, Wynn Buffett, Paris, and Planet Hollywood (dinner only since their lunch buffet is not as impressive).  I also liked the buffet at The Cosmopolitan.  \"M\" Hotel has a good buffet as well for the price.",

All you can eat:  - Steamed King Crab - Lobster Tails - Snow Crab Claws - Shrimp - Raw Oysters - Caviar - Sashimi - Sushi  - Prime Rib - Rack of Lamb - Roasted Beef Tenderloin  - Crab Cakes - Cheeses - Fruits - Desserts  - Pierrer Jouet Champagne - Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice  I'm not sure if I missed anything. If I did, that means I didn't eat it.  I think it's worth more towards a $60 price point rather than the $85 they charge, but I can't think of ANY other buffet with such an impressive selection. Besides, I think I actually ate and drank $85 worth of food. I also must admit I would've been happy just with the champagne, king crab, lamb, and caviar.   If I had to gripe about one thing it would be the quality of the food. The sashimi could be from Todai, the lobster tails get rubbery if you don't get it fresh, some of the meats are overcooked. But hey, what do you expect?   MUST TRY: To eat everything...",

They serve lobster tail, king crab legs, lamb, oyster, pre-cracked stone crab claws (which is my favorite there), and caviar.  I didn't see the caviar on any food station, but our server just brought it to our table when I asked him.  They also have a pretty decent selection of dessert with fresh made-to-order crepe.  Their only kind of ice cream - vanilla ice cream - is so yummy, and they make it in house with real fresh vanilla bean according to the server at the dessert station.    However, I am really not into their signature dish - lobster tail.  They were over cooked and too dry.  The lamb was nothing special, and it was also over-cooked for me.  I didn't even get close to their sushi station because the sushi there didn't look fresh at all.  I guess in the end, it is still a buffet even though the final bill ended up to be $110 per person.  One time experience here is probably good enough for me.",

Even after my husband went to the maitre d to get someone to clear our plates off the table, get more champagne, etc.  I was even passed over by three employees when I was standing in front of the omelet station.  When we got our second helping of the cheese popovers, that's when we first got the special salt that comes along with the popovers.  Duh!  Why didn't we get it with the first serving?  We even had to make our own Mimosas.  The place was not crowded, so why didn't we get better service?",

The lobster was really good and they did an excellent job of keeping it replenished.  However, what was equal or maybe even better was the cracked snow crab claws.  Cold, freshing, sweet, juicy AND all pre-cracked they were so addictive.  King crab legs were perhaps little dry on the ends but they aren't really best served hot in a buffet setting.  Was too addicted to the seafood to try out the sushi (it does seem a bit  out of place), omelets or breakfast items.  Had one piece of bacon and it was very well prepared but how badly can you screw up bacon anyways.  Prime rib looked good but the lamb was the meat winner.  It was nice they had racks of lamb all ready at different levels, rare, medium and well.  Nice touch with the heirloom tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella  as well.  The prawns were very large and tasty but with things like lobster and crab available, the prawns unfortunately lost out.  In any other regular buffet, these prawns would have stole the show.  Desserts were stellar but there's enough good posts about them I don't need to add more only that you have to pace yourself and leave some room for dessert.  If you can, get an earlier reservation as they don't kick you out until you want to leave.  The couple next to us started at 10:30 and didn't leave until 2:00.  They told us they are regulars and sometimes they also have scallops!",

I can't honestly say that I would rank the quality of the food up there with a five star restaurant but if you like to relax and enjoy 4 star food while being served bottomless mimosa's then search no more.    I was totally satisfied with the service, food and staff . A Great afternoon Champagne Brunch Buffet, one of which I have never had the experience before. And that's from a 15 yr Las Vegas Vet.",

The tuna tartare is beyond reproach, as is the prime rib, shrimp, sashimi, halibut, chopped salad & of course the fabulous Perrier Jouet.  The food is a full 5* However, the service is marginal.  Our waiter, Ryan was less than attentive, making judgements on how many of the items ordered were necessary for the table.  Really?  The visit in July was also clouded by the less than stellar wait staff.  This is a special experience that would be better received if the staff were more in-line with the quality of the expected dining experience.  Bally's please find a way to offer service to the same level as the food.",

We had the pleasure of meeting Char last month when we enjoyed the brunch with our usual dining friends, Paul and Karen.  As we are locals we tend to enjoy the Sterling Brunch more than the average guest.  Char remembered all four of us.  When she was contacted via email, she was able to give us the local treatment and secure reservations for us for May 21st.  She is a great addition to the Bally's family and we all hope her tenure at The Sterling brunch lasts for a very long time.  On another note, Jim, our waiter, was so good he kept the champagne flowing and we never had an empty glass.  He made the experience that much more enjoyable.  A consummate server.  Uber/Lyft are good options in order to take full advantage and enjoy the quality champagne!  Will definitely be back, hopefully sooner than later.",

I've read lots good reviews about it and had very high expectation. It took us awhile to realize that Sterling is not a restaurant. It's located inside Bally's steakhouse. I personally prefer to enjoy my Sunday brunch in a bright and open spaced restaurant (so I can enjoy the sunshine). Since Sterling is located inside a traditional steakhouse, I bet you can just imagine how this place is even with all the lights on full blast. Let's talk about food now. Crab claws and legs were very fresh and crab meat was sweet and succulent. Lamb chop was really good! It was tendered and perfectly cooked with their special mint sauce. Caviar that you can get from sushi bar was okay quality. It did meet my expectation since this is AYCE. However, I was very disappointed with the over cooked lobster tail!! I just felt like they could do so much better since this is a Sunday brunch with $90 per person!!! There was nothing really wowed me from dessert bar. But, I did enjoy coffee creme brulee and mixed fruit champagne. Overall, my dinning experience here was just okay and I felt like it's overpriced. I probably wouldn't go back again since there are so many good Sunday brunch places in Vegas.",

The selection is not as large as other buffets but you're still looking at 25-35 savory options and at least 20 dessert options. The options that they do have are AMAZING! I had a 10:30am reservation was seated within 5 minutes.   The restaurant is very dimly lit, probably for ambiance. I would prefer a little more lighting considering that it was relatively early for a large meal. Our waiter was Javier. He didn't make us feel rushed and constantly refilled our glasses and removed the dishes. The buffet foods were put out in small batches and were constantly refilled so I have no complaints about the freshness or availability of the food.   My favorite items at Sterling Brunch were the mashed potatoes, lobster, and lamb chop. Definitely my favorite mashed potatoes ever! The lobster tails were very large and were cooked perfectly. Javier told us that we came on a good weekend for the lobster tails. I think it just depends on the season and we were very lucky that they were huge! The lamb chops were seasoned with garlic and were so tender and juicy.  The desserts were delicious and very cute. I sampled the majority of them, all very good.  Don't forget to ask your waiter about the off menu items like the eggs benedicts and ice cream! I will definitely come back here the next time that I'm in Vegas! Although other buffets, like Bacchanal, are cheaper and have more food options, I don't think any other Vegas buffets' quality is remotely comparable with Sterling Brunch. 5 stars. I miss this place already.",

As soon as you are seated the waiters come by to fill up your glass with Perrier jouet champagne and I would be impressed if you you were able to drink more than half your glass without the waiters coming by to refill it. Honestly, their attention to the champagne is impressive. Also, keep in mind that you can also get coffee, tea, juice, etc. at no addition cost. You just have to ask for it.  The buffet itself is not huge compared to many of the other famed  buffets in town. This is definitely a quality over quantity situation. Everything is excellent. The prime rib, bread pudding French toast, and fingerling potatoes with chorizo were the real standouts for me. *Pro tip- make a small sandwich out of the popovers they leave at the table and the prime rib. Seriously,  you'll thank me later* The only slight disappointment were the oysters. They were dry and not very flavorful.   Don't forget to try the made to order eggs bennys. You have to order them from the waiter. I think they usually have three different kinds.   We sat next to a couple that said they have been coming to sterling's for the past 20 years.

There was a ton of seafood varieties, meats, egg dishes, french toast, veggies, salads, caviar, fruit....and that doesn't even cover all the dessert options! The food itself is prepared wonderfully and everything tasted decadent and fit for a queen. I particularly loved the popovers that they bring to your table. Also amazing was the service. We had Tony serving our section and he always made sure our champagne glasses were filled! He also had our entire section roaring with laughter and constantly cheersing one another. The atmosphere is so fun! It's definitely on the pricey side, but it's WORTH EVERY PENNY!",

Omg the service was impeccable, the food was terrific, they even had a dessert chef come to the table and make certain things to order. Plus the decor then was old world vegas, with nice wrap around booths and low lighting. Truly an authentic experience and worth the price of admission. Now, sadly when you go to the buffet lines guys are standing around with hairnets on their beards and talking about strip clubs when your getting your overcooked lobster tail lol. They kept the champagne but that is the only sad reminder to a time only a couple years ago when Ballys  actually had something special here on the strip. Skip this place and go to one of the many fine dinning resturants. Cost will come out the same and everything will be exponentially better quality.",

We were looking for a restaurant that said Sterlings in the Bally's until we stopped and asked some security guard who corrected us and let us know that it was actually BLT steak house ! When we got there we found out our reservations were actually a month out but the hostess was so very nice and accommodated us even though we made the mistake of coming a month early. The restaurant itself was very fancy, but the lighting was darker than I expected. Maybe the restaurant is more for a date setting? Well once we were seated we were greeted by our waiter who was in a suit and looked like a butler. I thought it was super cute and he was very attentive to us the entire time. He kept pouring the perrier jouet wine into our glasses Everytime our mimosas were getting low which was nice. The food was excellent ranging from top of the line seafoods like king crab legs, lobster, snow crab, oysters and they also had filet mignon, prime rib, lobster bisque, and the desserts were separated into their own area which was very nice. At the end of the meal as we walked out the hostess gave me some flowers to take home which was great.",

It was excellent, the service was top notch and the champagne flowed freely. I am no fan of champagne but even I have 5 or 6 glasses and it was very good champagne.   It is a buffet so you can eat all you want and man did we. It is a smaller buffet but very classy one. I had 3-plates of lobster tails and king crab legs. The lobster tails were maybe 6-8 ozs and the Alaskan King Crab legs were nice and fat and juicy. They also has prime rib, rack of lamb and various other high end items. The sushi looked good and they also had caviar.   All in all it was a very nice meal and a good day.   Would we go back?  yes we may for a special occasion.  Like I said it is a bit pricey, $95/person and you need to make reservations well in advance, at least 3-months. It is only one day a week and that is Sunday. It is located in the BLT Steakhouse in Bally's Hotel and Casino.",

The sushi was great and so was the filet mignon.   They must've filled my husband's champagne glass 8+ times throughout the course of our brunch and he was a happy camper.   The chocolate covered strawberries were so good as well! I just wish I had a bigger tummy so I could've enjoyed more food.   I did notice that they raised the price since we last ate here. It's $95 per person now, and I fear that if they keep raising the price, it may not be entirely worth it. But for $95 a person, I'll still keen going back.",

Our group felt that Sterling is loosing it;s touch.  In that, they are going for quantity instead of quality.  Crab was salty and soggy.  Lobster wasn't any better.    Only good thing was the champagne.  They still use a good quality champagne with their brunch.  Oh, yes.  Service was excellent as always.  Staff at the Sterling are top rated.  I think, Sterling can be so much better.  They should consider reducing selection lists and increase the quality of remaining food.  Just a slight improvement of lobster and crab will improve the overall impression of the restaurant drastically.  Hopefully, by the time my next visit arrives, their quality have improved.  Or at least, prove to me that the quality of the dish served on Super Bowl Sunday was a fluke and they aren't that bad.",

First off the location is great, really nice and well done room. Food is all located in a small room to the side. Service was great, waiter definitely kept the champagne glasses full.   Bloody Mary bar was and awesome choices of things to add to your Mary but the mix left tons to be desired couldn't even finish it.  Now the food. Popovers awesome, lobster very food, caviar solid not great but still good enough to go back for multiple helpings, waffles very nice , signature omelette awesome, bread pudding awesome, filet well fair would be nice...dry and overlooked, pork belly not my style, not a fan of smoked pork belly. Sushi not impressive, same buffet Quality you see elsewhere, dessert... with the exception of chocolate covered strawberries everything tasted commercially made.  Overall it was pretty great meal, and I'd go back. Maybe not soon...but absolutely do it again.",

My only thing is that it is waaaay too much money to be spent on a buffet that's why -1 star. Although they have all the good stuff that you probably won't find at your regular buffet. Reservation is a must especially if you have a big party. They serve champagne while you wait for the table. Awesome service!

I would say this is the best buffet in vegas followed by co-second place Wynn and Bacchanal.   $99 per person for unlimited filet mignon, lobster tail, lobster ravioli, chilled king crab, crab claws, prime rib (house of prime rib quality), champagne, hot sake, cavier, rack lamb, popovers. There were a lot less people there (compared to other buffets) and the dim lighting gave it almost more of an intimate atmosphere also. My favorites were the lobster and filet mignon. I would say try this place at least once and come back if you want unlimited surf and turf to your hearts content.",

    "text": "Being a local in Las Vegas certainly has it perks at times. While on Open Table, I saw a last minute opening for Sterling Brunch Buffet and decided to go for it. For those you know, getting reservations here is challenging with people waiting months to get in. With that said I thought I would leave my thought on my experience.  Location - Sterling Bruch is located at Bally's resort and casino inside of the BLT Steak house and has been around for about 40 years. The restaurant is smaller but I felt well laid out and was easy to get to the buffet and back to your table  Food - WAS AMAZING!!!! There are so many things from lobster to filet mignon, oysters, a cook to order prep service as well as traditional breakfast fare. I started with the steak and lobster, continued with a cook to order eggs with crab legs. HINT - ask about the non published menu. I was able to get a lobster eggs Benedict and it was awesome  Service - I really thought our wait staff did an amazing job. As an a example our drink glasses were never emptied, they checked on us to ensure our experience was top notch. As most of you know, when employees engage with customers, they generally ask where your from, and when we say were local, it seemed like it made our experience that much more personable. I hope that does not come off wrong, however its almost like how cool is it to be able to get last minute reservations here. When talking with other diners, they stated they planned their trips around eating at Sterling Buffet.   My friends, I will say the cost of $105 per person makes this the most expensive buffet in town,  but in my opinion was well worth it. My suggestion is to call on Sunday or, if you are willing to sit at the bar, get there early as bar seating is first come first serve.",

However Sterling did not disappoint and was well worth the cost. It was truly an amazing experience. The Champaign flowed and the lobster was impeccable. At 125 per person it was well worth every penny. I would recommend reservation as they are book 3 months out. We showed up at 8am for a seat at the bar at 9am",

Food quality wise is passable and would have been more enjoyable if it were not for the experience.   This is an advance reservation restaurant. We reserved 5 months ahead of time as we had plans to visit Las Vegas during the summer months.   This visit to Sterling Brunch was also inspired by a Worth It video by Buzzfeed as the most expensive buffet. Not worth the hype!  We checked in at the front desk bright and early for brunch to beat the crowds and spend time enjoying the food and place.   The food selection was nice, fresh, and appealing. Champagne and lobster was limitless as well as all the food at the buffet.   We had an initial enjoyable time, until there was harassment of another diner. Let's just say things got pretty escalated, but kept low key as we did not want to cause a scene. Long story short as this is a restaurant review we dined, paid the bill in full with tip, and notified management. Management was no help as they just suggested if we would like to speak to law enforcement. The opposition resumed dining as normal.   We left the venue immediately. Probably never coming back to this place. Fair warning for those seeking to dine at this place. If you can handle a glass of racism with your brunch, then by all means go and be merry.",

One of the main draws for this place is the unlimited pours of Perrier Jouet champagne, which is definitely a perk for those who like some champagne. The quality of food here is pretty good, when considering the amount you pay for it. The selection of food, however, is not as large as second of the other buffets. My friends liked the lobster tail, crab legs, and caviar. I enjoyed the filet mignon and prime rib. We all enjoyed the bottomless champagne (they also have a bloody mary station). The customer service was pretty good for our large group.   Overall,  a cool place that you should at least experience once.",

There is no buffet line you make reservations which is so much better than waiting.. there is steak, lobster tails, crab, even caviar .. it's a great experience and recommend to anyone.. only bad thing I had was the oysters are kinda sandy . Other than that the wait staff was really friendly funny n personable.. I hope to bring others to this experience",

You have to line up an hour before opening to get a seat otherwise you'll go on a waiting list which could be 2 hours.   I have been wanting to try this brunch for literally a decade. It's is definitely more  higher end food compared to any other Vegas buffet or brunch. The selection isn't huge but what they do have is quality.   My complaint was the king crab was hard to crack unless your a pro at it since it is spiky. I also thought the prime rib could have been better since it is at a steak house.   The lobster was very meaty and plump not a one biter. My feelings about this buffet is if you love quality seafood and is able to eat it early in the morning then you can get your money's worth.   It's is now before tip $135.00 per person after tip it cost me $160.00 so it is pretty steep for one person. Im glad I finally got to try it but that's it for me. I didn't get any wow factor, I could get a better tasty meal at way cheaper price somewhere else but like I said if you like quality seafood and able to eat alot then it may be worth it for you. It is bottomless Pierre juilet champagne and bottomless bloody merry bar... Worth the experience if your pockets are deep ..",

I made reservations for 8 people in NOVEMBER and we just enjoyed the food last Sunday. 3 months. 3 MONTHS! Man alive...  This place is everything you want it to be, and more. It lives up to the hype. Two times now, and the service is amazing, and the food is always perfectly hot.   Last time, we raved about the large lobster tails. This time, it was the king crab. For whatever reason, it was better.  We came here 2 years ago and everyone's favorite was the Bananas Foster french toast. Our group of friends have been talking about it for 2 years. It's ridiculous. I was so happy to see they still have it. It's so perfectly sweet with layers of ooey gooey siz-zurp. I'm not a dessert person. There are very few I love to gorge on. This is top 3, fo sho.   Guys, this place is $120pp. Everything is super fresh. Super tasty. The champagne is always flowing. I would know, because I got drunk and had to take a two hour nap. Getting drunk is not my fav thing. But hey, it was a special occasion.   If you want a luxury brunch, try it out. If you regret it, I would be shocked.",

The setting is fine dining without white gloves, your waters and champagne don't see the bottom of the glasses, the brioche on the table is fresh, flaky and buttery and the butter served is covered with a cute little cover and has a stamp of a cow.  All the seafood is perfectly executed: - the shrimp were cooked and presented well, tartar sauce had complexity, some lemon juice, some umami from worchestershire, could've used a little Tobasco. - the rock crabs were appetizing and weren't briny/salty as I've had before on a one of the high end brunches which is half the price of this one. - oysters were delicious and large (didn't ask the type as we were kind of in a hurry or star-struck hahaha) - the star of the show were so good, lobsters were firm yet soft and ran juices over your lips as you bit into their thick fleshy tails, I had 6 of them, yes, and I think I could've had more hahahaha, nah I was good after 6.  One of the biggest impacts this brunch had on our experience was that the chefs went out of their way to prepare a Gluten Free and Dairy Free entrees of filet mignon and Lobster tails for my best friend E. She felt so special and most importantly as anyone else, not estranged because of her allergies. Thank you chef Eddie, tall chef of African descent that spearheaded the hospitality extended to E for her allergies. We made sure the chefs were taken care of as they all pitched in.  I recommend The Sterling Brunch and will be back next year, a matter of fact this will probably be patronized by me as long as it exists.",

    "text": "We've been anticipating this meal for years, made a reservation months in advance and booked flights / hotel for the weekend just to come. We arrived Sat and ate at Hell's Kitchen and Bacchanal -- amazing food, highly recommend those, but we thought no way they'd live up to the star of the weekend, Sterling Brunch.   Let's start with the food, because tbh as long as the food is stellar, I can deal w anything else.   Lobster tail: Wow. These were the worst lobsters I've ever had in my life. These were mushy and paste like. It was inedible. I had to spit mine out. I then tried a few more, in sheer disbelief it could be this bad. They all were. I really don't know who is writing these other rave reviews; maybe if you've never had lobster and have zero point of reference, you'd think these are good. It's clear these have been frozen and are nowhere near fresh. If you want an example of a fresh lobster tail, go try the Lobster Risotto at Hell's Kitchen.  Filet Mignon: took one bite - no seasoning, tough, could barely swallow it. I've had BLT steak before, it was not this bad. My husband's was also over cooked.   King crab: having had amazing snow crab legs at Bacchanal the night prior, I started ripping into these with glee. Only the shell is extremely hard and prickly. The hash marks were not in the right places. It was so difficult to get the meat, the payoff was not worth it. I ate a couple and gave up, when I genuinely expected to eat a few platefuls.  In my second round, I had to branch out to other food because I just couldn't bring myself to eat more of those nasty food. I then also tried the salmon, lobster ravioli, smoked salmon, banana French toast, sausage, bacon, lobster bisque and shrimp. Salmon was dry, ordinary. Lobster ravioli filling was ok, but shell was hard. Smoked salmon super ordinary, took one bite and left it. French toast was ok. Sausage was good. Lobster bisque was ok. Shrimp was nasty af - inside felt gooey and undercooked. Couldn't eat one shrimp. Bacon had funky flavor; tbh I didn't know bacon could ever be bad but they did it.  At the end of my meal, having eaten a fraction of what I planned, I was honestly pissed. I feel like this place is now a gimmick - something that sounds luxurious to people who normally don't eat things like lobster and they splurge on this, their psyche tricking them into thinking it must be great to justify the cost, they leave a 5-star review, and the cycle repeats. I genuinely don't see how anyone can rave about this place otherwise. If you're into food at all, this place will be the biggest disappointment.   I will not be back. I would not come back even if this place was $20 pp. Actually, you could not pay me to come back. Just thinking about it makes me sick. I don't ever leave Yelp reviews, but felt compelled as a PSA to do so because I too fell for the rave reviews before going. If you do go, please do the right thing and leave an honest review.",

First of all, shout-out to Visa Concierge for getting this amazing Sunday brunch ressie on Labor Day wkend!! If you don't use them, you should. MAJORLY awesome and simple tool.   Ressies were made for 11:30am on Sunday (obv) of Labor Day wkend. Packed house for waits. The hostess was quoting 2+hr wait times. Honestly, thank goodness we had ressies. We were seated about 12mins after our ressie time. Nbd, they drop you with some fancyyy champagne while you wait. It's the same unlimited champagne you'll receive throughout the meal. But save space! There's also a Bloody Mary bar *heart eyes*.   I tried everything from caviar to lobster tails (several) to shrimp scampi to snow crab legs to raw oysters. They've got it all. And it was real, real fresh. Obviously, the star of the show was the unlimited lobster tail. And I was super disappointed w my first piece. It was def overbooked and dry and crumbly. But it was redeemed with my later pieces. Shrimp and oyster were great. As well as the lobster bisque. Passes would've been the caviar and weak dessert options.   Am I glad I tried this spot? Hell yes. Was it good? More or less so, yes. Would I come back? UHHH for 120pp for lunch, no. You can't feed me enough lobster tails to think otherwise. 4 stars",

Located at Ballys, the brunch is only available on Sunday and it is highly recommend to make reservations.. not even sure that they offer walk-ins. FYI I had to book over 3 months in advance and got it!   SERVICE Our waiter was Jeff, which was super awesome because he was only the Worth It episode I watched. He was funny, friendly and attentive! He kept on filling our glasses with champagne ;)  EATS In general the food options are limited but the quality is definitely there. I'll list just the food that I LOVED and what stood out to me.   BREAD - they give you bread for the table and omg this s the best bread in the entire world, it's fluffy, buttery and crispy! All the characteristics for a good piece of bread! Is it sad that I loved it that much? I don't care!   BANANA BREAD PUDDING?- save this for last and ask for some ice cream so you can have it as dessert. The right amount of sweetness, the flambayed bananas well make you go bananas ;)   LOBSTER TAIL - so delicious and dip it in more butter, nuff said   KING CRAB - boyfriend got this (I don't like to work my food) he said it was super fresh and this is one of the items you indulge to get your $$ worth   CAVIAR - must get with the little pancakes, fried capdtsu and creme fraicher, lawd that's the perfect combination of decadence right hurr  *They have a Bloody Mary Bar where the bartender will customize your drinks and top it off with whatever goodie you want!",

    "text": "Unlimited Lobster tails. Unlimited caviar. Unlimited champagne. Unlimited Lamb. Unlimi- okay, you get the idea.   The Sterling Brunch is the legendary mecca of stuffing your face, located at BLT steak in Ballys on Sundays.  Now let's get the bad out of the way. $110, plus $15 for the Veuve champagne upgrade(which is totally worth it). Not everyone may be able to get their bang for buck. At 6'3\", 250lbs, and an eye for seafood and champagne, I absolutely was.  The buffet is smaller than some of the sprawling decadence of places like Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, and Wynn. In fact, compared to those its downright modest. You will not see the vast array and variety you see at others. They focus on seafood, no question, so not your brunch if you arent a fan. It is a buffet style, so yes, you might go hit or miss with a lobster tail or crab leg. If they're not great, throw them in the shell bowl and go get more. Its unlimited, what's stopping you? Enough with the disclaimers.  We had the chance to upgrade to Veuve Cliquot for $15, and considering I killed somewhere between 2 and 4 bottles,well worth it. There are several little menu items you can have brought to you as well, such as a lobster eggs benedict. Standouts included the lamb and prime rib. Lobster tails were mostly good, couple of misses. 4 good ones down. Half a dozen colossal shrimp, couple slabs of prime rib, half rack of lamb, oysters literally covered in caviar. Not a fan of the crab legs, but I had been eating at Joe's. Hard to draw a comparison between the two, and honestly not fair.   One final thing that merits it's own section. Tony. This gem, this hero, this f****** pinnacle of service made the meal. I think I saw the bottom of my glass once, and I was working VERY hard to see the bottom. He was funny, efficient, professional and all around excellent. Even when we missed last call he made a quick little run to get us one more piece of lamb and dessert.  I could barely crawl away from the table, let alone walk. I really didnt want to. But they made me leave. (Brunch was over, not unruly). Make a reservation here immediately.",

So wonderful had to take seconds and fifths! This is no hidden secret as getting a rez took us 3 months; And so worth the wait!   Hugo, you Rock Sir! Made us feel so welcome and although our first time here, his genteel manner made us feel like long time customers. He made the beginning and end of our visit delightfully memorable. \"You don't want to eat here! Please leave! We need the tables!\" Apparently they are so busy, must be awful!  We were a party, and there were 4 of us. We came in to slay and sleigh out.  Started with Champagne, toasted, and then proceeded to get toasted. Miss Joyce, as always, was at the helm directing the alcohol consumption. \"More Oysters more champagne!\" No one dare argue with a lady, especially one in waiting.   The nitty gritty: Was champagne mentioned? Ok.  Oysters- fresh and abundant by the dozens Lobsters-How many? Pffft! I had 2 and not sure how many the table consumed.  Caviar- please see picture and drool King Crab Legs- ZZ Top \"She's got legs\" Stone Crab- Please stop me! Awesome! Prime Rib- tender and slow baked, (please see photo) Rack of Lamb- so juicy delicious had to gnaw at the bone afraid I'd eat my fingers! Sushi- fresh yellowtail and perfect rice (all I had) Desserts? Who has room after all that? I do!  Consumed way too much and also ate to much food. Is there a bottom line? Apparently not! We chose to leave. They'll allow you to eat your weight in food if you're not  careful.  STAY FAR AWAY! And do not tell anyone its at the far right back corner of Bally's Casino at the BLT restaurant!  PS....call Uber or tow truck to get me out ;)",

    "text": "Welcome to the Sterling Brunch!  Champagne wishes and caviar dreams hidden away behind BLT Steak!  Reservations were set three months out on a dinner celebration for mine and Jon H.'s birthday.  Were we hasty?  You betcha!  Funny how three bottles of wine suddenly gets the Vegas itch going.  The four of us invaded Sterling Brunch and we have decided: IT'S WORTH IT!  Unlimited Perrier Jouet NV Champagne, caviar, gruyere cheese popovers, giant chocolate-dipped strawberries, Blue Point oysters, stone crab claws, Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails, ... I'm still floating on Cloud Nine after visiting this place!  That or I might be slightly drunk.  Jon H. is really good at peer-pressuring others to drink more champagne and I like it (My liver says elsewise)!  We easily took down six or seven bottles of champagne and Hugo never let our glasses go empty.  He even left the bottle at our table because Jon H. is a boss!  Speaking of Hugo, he's so charismatic and Duff was equally as charming in person as he is in the Buzzfeed video.  Both men are extremely good story-tellers.  Give them a raise, Mr. Bally's!  While the selection is more limited compared to other buffets, the quality is there.  Skip your typical breakfast items and pack in the seafood and filet mignons!  It's a total splurge and you can probably get yourself a fabulous meal elsewhere and have it be easier to eat/drink your money's worth but you can't put a price on adventure, experience, and memories.  I had a blast at Sterling Brunch and I would come back again!  $95/pp",

I stay away from the breakfast foods since I can have them anywhere.  After a glass of the wonderful French champagne, I head right for the caviar, oysters and lamb, all my favs, and I could stop there and be perfectly happy.  I have never really enjoyed their lobster, or the boiled shrimp (too ordinary) but almost everything else has been just perfect.  Service has always been impeccable, and I was never rushed out even after sitting and eating and drinking for 2 hours or more.  I will definitely be going again, perhaps I'll even be lucky enough to get a Groupon next time!",

Customer service was super excellent, the gentleman that was our waiter was top notch! This is definitely a 5 star buffet, so make sure you dress accordingly!   The buffet itself was heavenly! There is too much to list, but the items that I favored were the lobster, lamb, filet minion, caviar, salmon benedict, the raw oyster bar, the crab claws, and the king crab legs. Here is the link to the menu items: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.harrahs.com%2Fimages%2FProperty%2Fblv%2Fdining%2FBLV_SterlingBrunch_Menu.pdf&s=5c076ccf1f469c4d0f2d5a6d1899b50dd5efccc568daee4948ce6705f0511096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">harrahs.com/images/Prope...</a>  Overall, a great experience at the mother of all buffets in Las Vegas, I highly recommend to at least trying this once in your life, you won't be disappointed. If I ever do go back again, I would request to sit near the buffet, so it's less of a walk. The whole credit card rant I had earlier about this place turned out to be OK, I didn't have charges applied to my card (it's been about a month now), I ended up paying it with another card just to see if they would or not.

From the moment we sat down we were greeted warmly by our waiter, Tony, who gave us the history of the buffet while popping a fresh bottle of French champagne. (He promised our glasses would never be empty, and he definitely kept this promise.) At first glance it seemed like every thing was going to be delicious, and the food absolutely did not disappoint. Unlimited Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails, filet mignon, sushi and other staples from BLT steaks menu were available from the buffet and we were also served Lobster bisque, tuna tartar and caviar by our waiter. And then when we thought it couldn't get any better, the desserts were just as decadent and over the top, some with gold leaf shavings, but all were so delicious. Overall it was an incredible experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking to do something unlike anything else in Vegas! It may seem expensive but seeing what you get for the price, it does make sense. A big hats off to Tony our waiter for making the experience that much more enjoyable! Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas just to get to eat at the buffet again!",

It includes the following:  -Lobster -Caviar -Prime Rib -Roasted Lamb -Assorted Cheese -House champagne for mimosas -Dessert Bar - with a chef!  Those are just the starters.  The food as far as I remember exceptional.  I think because i took my time to enjoy everything.  I suggest that if you want to truly enjoy it, take your time and take it in.  No rush.  They replenish everything pretty quick.  Their dessert bar is pretty good as well.  This place get's pretty packed even with the price tag.  Make sure you call for reservations.    If you don't mine the splurge try this place out.  Like I said there's rarely any place that serve lobster, prime rib, lamb for brunch.  The Ritz Carlton's Easter Brunch is about $75 so for $10 more you get caviar and a active chef at the dessert bar.    In my oppinion the money was well spent for me.  I love food and I love taking my time.  The service was amazing as well for a buffet.",

Reservation/arrival: booking the reservation over the phone was pretty straightforward..until the agent TOLD me that she was going to put me on hold, half way through the booking? Thanks for asking! Checking in at the restaurant was pretty swift, we were seated within a few minutes. 3 stars here for what I would expect at a 3 star restaurant.  Food: the food selection is just like all the other reviews: caviar, lobster, lamb, prime rib... Etc. (ran out of oysters when I was there at 11 am). However, the food taste was mediocre at best. There wasn't anything where I felt was a must have. I would avoid the sushi, they were not freshly made and didn't look too fresh either. 4 stars here, best food selection in town, NOT prepared by gourmet chefs.  Service: I am very particular with service, but here's what I felt: I felt like our server Jason needed some elegance training courses. When we arrived, he immediately introduced himself and asked if we wanted champagne (yes!!). The ladies got their food and came back, I then got food and came back, but none of our drinks were here! When he finally returned, he did this back and forth act where he would reach across the table and pour some in each cup while waiting for the bubbles to settle. This caused the champagne to spill each time (due to lack of coordination) and simply looked bad. The back and forth thing went on for the rest of the meal. It took another 10 minutes to clear the extra set of plate settings that were on the table when we arrived. A bit into dining, I asked for a mimosa. He simply took my half DRANK orange juice and poured it into my half DRANK champagne... right in front of me. If restaurant management ever reads this.. Please!! Bring the customer a new glass! We also got the snow crab legs with a plate full of other food at some time, the legs were impossible to open by hand. We finished all the other food on the plate and finally had to ASK Jason for a crab leg cracker.   When I attempted to get lamb at the chef station, the chef was busy chatting with another staff member 10 feet from the station. When he finally turned his attention to me, he asked me what I wanted and then started chatting with another staff member! He finally remembered to serve me and then apologized \"for getting distracted\". This also happened to my girlfriend when she tried to get some lamb.  Later on, my girlfriend also saw the manager and some staff arguing by the cold selection about melting ice? So unprofessional! 2 stars for the service, only because 1 star is saved for a mega disaster experience.  Overall, it did not meet my $85 expectations. Food selection was great, food quality was ok, service seriously sucked.",

    "text": "In Vegas there is no shortage of fine dining experiences available and I have enjoyed many 4 & 5 star steakhouses in NY, CA & Vegas. I am thrilled to report that the Sterling Brunch at Bally's is amongst my favorite dining experiences in Las Vegas and an excellent value IF you enjoy a leisurely meal and sample all that this buffet has to offer. If you want 100's of menu items then you may be disappointed. There are other worthy buffets that offer good food and variety to satisfy most any palate. If you're satisfied with fewer, very high quality items with exceptional service then I strongly recommend this brunch.  The quality/taste of the food prepared here is in the same league as any 4 star steak house. What is provided is a beautiful feast of traditional steak house favorites. Items I enjoyed include: aged well-crusted/seasoned filet mignon with herbed steak butter; sea bass finished in a light basil pesto type sauce; king crab legs & drawn butter; split maine lobster tail removed from the shell upon request; rack of lamb, fresh oysters on the half shell with mignonette sauce; prime rib served with a rich thick au jus that is reduced to a near glaze; crab claws, roasted applewood bacon slab cut to order; assorted sushi (small selection) and sake; truffle mashed potatoes; excellent creamed spinach; jumbo shrimp cocktail; individual antipasti plates; crab cakes; omelet (including an excessively rich lobster boursin cheese offering) and that's just what's on the actual buffet line. Is this a massive selection? No, not at all compared to most Vegas buffets but I would personally much prefer this smaller selection of classic steak house items done right and seasoned to perfection over the often mass produced inconsistent and underseasoned choices at many buffets and brunches in town.   Some complain about the lack of salad bar. There is no salad bar but there are additional offerings from the kitchen that are brought out to order by the attentive servers (all finely clad in tuxedos by the way). Options included: some of the best lobster bisque ever with creme fraische and microgreens, caesar or chopped salad, caviar, tuna tartar, prosciutto eggs benedict, and belgian waffles with macerated berries. In addition the wait staff is constantly topping you off with unlimited Perrier Jouet champagne (avg price $50/bottle in stores), juice, coffee, and even simple syrup for our iced tea \"so you don't have to wait for the sugar to dissolve\", said one of our kind servers.   The micro desserts were a feast for the eyes and mouth, though I will say I'm saddened they no longer offered the praline crepes and cherries jubilee I had read about. The desserts are comparable to other great buffets but the attention to detail was phenomenal. Miniature carmelized pineapple upside down cakes with edible gold leaf; baby martini glasses layered with custard and mango coulis topped with whipped cream, powder sugar dusted raspberries, and a long chocolate curl like a swizzle stick painted blue. Cake pops that are not cake but in fact layers of chocolate encasing rich chocolate mousse. Huge chocolate covered strawberries, some covered in oreo cookie crumbs or roasted almonds. Mini cream puffs wearing a wide brimmed \"hat\" of carmelized sugar. Napoleons, glazed fruit tartlets, dark chocolate tartlets topped with delicate butterfly wings of white chocolate. The tiny treats were as tasty as they were beautiful. Plus seasonal ripe berries to compliment the champagne and carmelized banana bread pudding french toast.   Service is friendly, highly attentive, and if they see you coming from the buffet line with a full plate they rush to take it from you and escort you back to your table. Reservations mean no wasting precious vacation time waiting in amusement park-like lines. Considering the avg cost of a moderate to high end steakhouse a la carte menu the $85 price for all the food, champagne, and sake described above is a steal. Just be sure you bring your total rewards players card to get the $85 price. Vegetarians and those with small appetites or a preference for simple food will not fare well here. A steak house aficionado with a love for surf and turf will not only delight in this dining experience but boast that it was a great value for their money. To maximize your dollar sit and stay a while and drink up! My 3 king crab legs, 2 lobster tails, filet mignon, 2 bowls of lobster bisque (to which I added another cut up lobster tail!), 6 glasses of champagne, caviar appetizer, tiramisu and chocolate strawberries alone would FAR exceed $85 at even a moderate priced steak house chain and I ate more than this. Perhaps it was better before as some yelpers suggest but it doesn't disappoint now!",

    "text": "Date/Time:  Sunday - 11am Occasion:  Sunday Champagne brunch with daddy and little brother Party of:  Three Location:  Inside the Sterling Steakhouse.  Antiquated decor. Cute little servers running around in their tuxes.  Clean and well-set up food stations. Ordered:  All you can eat/drink Total incl gratuity: ~$320  After so much hype from my dad, it was finally time for me make my way to the highly acclaimed Sterling Sunday Brunch at Bally's.  The pricetag is a little high but it includes all you can eat and drink champagne.  I can't drink that much so I only finished off one glass of champagne. Disappointing...I know!   However, I can definitely pack down the food!  Seven lobster tails later, I was still stuffing myself with soup, waffles, prime rib, etc. :)   The selection of fine foods is impressive.  They serve lobster tails, and I mean lobster tails.  Not that dinky crawfish or mini-lobster they serve at some other buffets.  I'm talking roasted, chunky, delicious lobster tails.  What's also brilliant?  They serve lobster bisque!  You grab a lobster tail, shred up a few bites, and toss it into the bisque.  Makes for a wonderfully delicious little starter.  The amount of food they serve here is not vast however they focus on quality.  It's well thought out and of course, well organized.  The interior room is where they house their salads, fruits, cheeses, and  iced seafood station, which included chilled oysters, shrimps, smoked salmon, mussels, stone crab claws, and sturgeon caviar.  I seriously couldn't get enough of the caviar.  It was delicious.  Not overly salty like some I've had previously.  I must have eaten my $85 worth alone in caviar! :)  In the main room, you can find a row of breakfast foods. Crisp strips of bacon, eggs benedict, freshly prepared Belgian waffles, ham, sausage, and an omelet station.  I steered clear of the breakfast foods in fear of filling up my tummy too quickly.  Opposite the breakfast line-up were more heartier items like steamed crabs legs, yukon gold mashed potatoes, steamed carrots and haricot verts, and different chicken and beef choices.  Of course what buffet would be complete without the carving stations of prime rib, turkey, and lamb?  The mentionable list: the crab claws, lobster tails, oysters, waffle, caviar, the bacon, and selection of fresh raspberries and blueberries.  Sweet by themselves or great to throw into your champagne. Their food deserves about four stars and service right on par with four stars as well.  Service is not overly intrusive, but I have to be honest, I was expecting a little more from the type of place.  There were a couple times our glasses were left empty until we waved someone down.  Nonetheless, I'm pleased I finally got to try the ever so famous Ballys Sunday Brunch!",

    "text": "Bally's Sterling Brunch was just okay.  I had the same reservations as many people did, how can a buffet offer great food?  Convinced by yelp reviews and the lure of a high price tag - $85.00, I foolishly thought it must be good.  In the end, regardless of the high price tag, it boils down to one thing.  You can only expect so much from a buffet.  At a buffet, food will be sitting around so it can't be at it's best.    My husband and I did not enjoy the Champagne and ended up drinking orange juice or water.    FRESH SMOKED NOVA SALMON - it wasn't the best quality of smoked salmon.  Can get better at Whole Foods.  AMERICAN STURGEON CAVIAR - had to ask someone where the caviar was since it was dispensed by two Asian woman guarding not only the caviar but the sushi. The caviar had a slightly salty and fishy taste which was good but did not pop in my mouth.  Instead, the texture was a bit mushy.  SHRIMP COCKTAIL - fine  CRAB CLAWS - not the freshest  GRILLED MARINATED VEGETABLES - fine  FRUIT - my husband had tons of it and fruit was very tasty  CRANBERRY CRUSTED RACK OF LAMB - okay and tasted a little gamey  GRILLED FILET MIGNON, POTATO CROQUETTES - I am not a big meat eater but the filet mignon was tasty and the sauce was good.  Loved the potato croquettes.  DESSERTS - tried an assortment of desserts and they looked a lot better than they taste.  Not worth the calories.  In all fairness it is a buffet; hence 3 stars and not 2, and one of the better ones.  With that said, will we go back?  Let's just say, even if Bally's changed their price to $35.00, the quality of food was not up to par, so my husband and I will not be returning.",

No, you gotta make reservations, for this bad boy and these reservations go by fairly quick. Now, wtf and why? The only reason I'd give this 2 stars instead of 1 star is because the guys behind the food counters and the waiter were extremely helpful and pleasant. Outside of service its a F'in Buffet with high quality items like Caviar, Lobster, Filet Mignon, blah blah blah, but it still taste like Buffet food -(low quality). What a waste of high quality items that a steakhouse or seafood restaurant could do so much more with.  I was expecting quality tasty food (we ended up paying about 105/pp with tax and tip) but instead got really dry rubber lobster, a decent king crab leg, and a variety of other dry and tasteless meats. The prime rib was pretty good though that was nice and juicy. The free flowing Perrier Jouet champagne was nice but the food was pretty damn disappointing. Maybe cuz the night before we had SW steakhouse???? I'm done with Buffets, even the Buffet of Buffets taste like a damn Buffet, and I don't like it.",

While it's pricey at $75, it's totally worth it because you end up staying there for at least a couple of hours, think of it as saving money at the tables :-p.  It's only open on Sunday and it is actually inside one of Bally's other restaurants.  Reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  This is Truely a full service buffet with unlimited champaign & drinks (don't know about the other alcohols though).  The selection was AMAZING, almost any kind of seafood you want, king crab legs, baked lobster, crab cakes, oysters, shrimp and of course, the CAVIAR!!!!  As much as you want and the quality is surprisingly good.  Not over salted.  All kinds of carving stations too!  When we went there were 2 kinds of rack of lamb, prime rib, turkey, etc.  They also had a very good braised bison short rib, yes I said bison :-p.  Lots and lots of desserts as well, the champaign raspberry gelee was tasty as were the chocolate dipped strawberries.  Next time we're in Vegas on Sunday, we'll definitely be at Sterling Brunch!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are aficionados of Sunday bottomless champagne brunches. Being New Yorkers, we feel they are a pleasure and a reward after a sometimes stressful workweek. Since we knew we'd be in Vegas on a Sunday, I did research online and decided upon Bally's. Even though I saw where some reviewers didn't think the brunch wasn't as up to snuff as it had been, we thought we'd give it a go. The minute we stepped up to the reservation desk, we were greeted by a friendly young woman. Then, immediately, the manager appeared and gentlemanly escorted us to our table. Anthony, our server, could not have been more jovial and attentive. We were instantaneously brought champagne. I am used to starting off with a Bloody Mary (being the lush I am), but Anthony informed me that they were not included with the brunch. Nevertheless, I wanted one, and it was one of the finest I've ever had. On to the food: I have never been a big fan of lobster, but it's edible, so I started off with a lobster tail. To me, it was a little on the tough side. However, the prime rib more than compensated for it; indeed, it was the most delicious I've had. The lamb chop was nonpareil, and coupled with the mint jelly, was delightful. We both liked the creamed spinach, and the truffle mashed potatoes were out of this world. You do have to ask for the caviar; one reviewer mentioned you get a miniscule portion, which is not unTrue. However, I'm sure if it were dispensed freely on the buffet, there would be those who would be gluttons and put the restaurant out of business. So it's a necessary evil.  No, it's not a lavish spread, but the selection is more than adequate, and the service impeccable. Moreover, there's not that annoying having to wait in line, and our fellow diners were civilized (meaning not loud). This is more expensive than the other Vegas brunches, but, like they say, you get what you pay for.",

My gfs and I spent 2.5 hours drinking and eating well as best as we could before our flights back home.  Our server, Scott, made sure our champagne glasses were never empty and our plates were always cleared (there were plenty of empty plates with piles of crab legs and lobster shells).  The selection is definitely the top of the line, there were huge shrimps and delicious caviar.  The herb crusted lamb chops were definitely the best I've ever had.  Then for dessert, there are white chocolate-covered strawberries and freshly made crepes.  Before being seated there's a stack of printed menus of what is being served for the day.  The $75 price tag is definitely not too much to pay for this delicious buffet of gluttony.",

    "text": "If you ever come up big at the craps table, and feelin like you could afford a $100 meal, just stick with the nice steak houses or sushi spots.  You don't need to waste it on Sterlings.  At what's raved as the best buffet on the strip, its probably more like best wasted money on the strip.  For $60 at the Wynn buffet and the rest on black may offer you a higher return.  I mean its hard to justify a $95 bill.  btw, its $95 regular, but if you have a Total Rewards Card, you get a discount starting at $85 so GET IT if you choose to come here.  But then there are 4 things that you can appreciate by dining here.    1.  The service.  The gentlemen tell great stories and provide excellent service.  They'll even talk about the different celebrities that have made there way into the restaurant and who is approachable and who just prefers to be left alone.  They can even get your food for you if you wish.   2.  The place has that old style baller status feel.  If you've gone to the old timer steakhouses with the stripe walls and brown booths, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's like you could picture the 1920s mafia and gangsters just smoking their cigars chilling. 3.  The caviar.  Sturgeon Caviar at a buffet?  Unheard of.  But get as much as you can (the lady limit me at my 3rd approach) and just smear that goodness on everything you see on our plate. 4.  The champagne.  Pierrer Jouet or Moet is not  your typical Korbel or cheapo champagne.  And the best part is....they'll constantly fill it up if you're the thirsty type.  That's it.  Those four things are the only things I enjoyed and perhaps tried my best to make good of that money spent.  Other than that, everything else sucked.  -Crab claws - not fresh, small, hard to open, barely any -Oyster - tiny, but edible -Crab cake - too filling and nothing special -Lobster Tail - yes, the first 2 were good, but then you get sick of it and it's just a pain to try and eat more. -Prime rib - ironically as a steakhouse, this piece of sad dried up London Broil looking thing even looked depressing.  I had a small bite, and regretted it. -Lamb Rack - If only you could just eat the rare part and discard the rest because everything else around that was over salted and too fatty. -Tiger jumbo shrimp - too much isn't good for you. -Sushi - what was I thinking.  So there are a ton of bad stuff, but if you focus on the good, maybe you can see it being worth it.  But for the variety and somewhat upscale buffet, I'm glad I tried it.",

I thought people were starting to mess with us when we asked where this place was and they kept saying in the back of the casino to the right.  Seriously, this is the best buffet you'll find on the strip, and I've probably been to a good lot of them. Yes, it is steep in price (probably will spend about $105+ pp), but you won't find nearly the freshest oysters, stone crabs, and lobster tails anywhere else. I probably ate a whole lineage of lobsters on my visit- they were all so nice and juicy (I think my friend had one rubbery tail but we'll let that slide). There is a wide selection of other items available for brunch like caviar, sushi, prime rib, etc. LOVED IT ALL. You can also order eggs benedict with either steak, prosciutto, or lobster. The hollandaise sauce is amazing! All of this while you are treated to unlimited champagne. I stuffed myself so much that I didn't quite make it to dessert but again, the display was beautiful. I'm sure they tasted great.  I'm ready to go back, this time with my sweat pants!",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to this. We booked 3 months out. I understand usually at buffets the quality of food is usually not as good but kind of figured at $99 a person and with the type of food they serve that it would be different. I was wrong. I was mostly looking forward to the unlimited lobster and oysters. I was really disappointed with the lobster because it was very mushy in some areas and rubbery in others. I would have liked it to have a butter and garlic flavor as I usually expect with my lobsters but the flavor was kind of bland. The oysters were my favorite. They were blue point. I would have preferred if they were separated from the shell already so I didn't have to pick at them but they weren't. They also werent as plump and sweet as other blue points I have had. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and I could tell the quality of the meat was good, even though a little more flavor would have been nice. I was kind of looking for A1 sauce. The King crab was ok. Some were juicy and moist, some werent. The dessert bar was very nice but they could label them at least. The unlimited champagne was very nice. We made mimosas with them.   Pretty much overall, the quality of everything did not match other regular places I have eaten. It was pleasant and a good one time experience. Do I recommend it? Yes, the experience is great. The staff, servers, and atmosphere are great. The food is so so. I have had better lobsters, oyster, and filet mignon elsewhere. There was a lot of other good stuff that other people had mentioned that are probably good but I did not try as I was saving room for mainly lobster, oysters, and filet mignon. At least I can say that I have been here, it was fun. But for $99 plus tip, I could have ordered 5+ dozens of oysters and a bunch of lobsters elsewhere and it would have tasted better! So make a call on whether you want to spend so much on \"just ok\" food before you choose to come here.",

Take your pick of all-you-can-eat lobster tails (!!!), jumbo shrimp, rack of lamb, lobster ravioli, caviar (complete with all the proper fixings), desserts, and champagne. Located inside of restaurant BLT Steak, this buffet will cost you a pretty penny ($99 pp) but is well worth it.  The highlights were the lobster and caviar. I wasn't sure what to expect for quality (since it's a buffet), but these were excellent quality and by themselves made the price worth it. The large lobster tails were not overcooked but were sweet and tender. The caviar was good quality, not fishy or overly salty. The champagne was perrier jouet, not cheap crap. They also served fantastically fluffy popovers. All in all, it's a gluttonous, indulgent must-try buffet at least once.   My one and only complaint was the lighting -- I know it's located in a steakhouse, and thus dimly lit and full of dark decor and mood lighting, but it was super dark in the dining area... to the point that we asked for a different table so we could see our food better!!

Sushi looked as if they have been sitting under the light for a while, reminded me of the sushi at the 20$ chinese buffets.   My mom and I came for the crabs, lobsters and oysters. Unfortunately all of them were disappointments, one after another. We have tasted fresh seafood before, having been on road trips across the country. The most fresh tasting seafood was the restaurant across the Atlanta Georgia aquarium at 80$ for two included lobsters, crabs, oysters, and clams.   Needless to said we did not enjoy our brunch. Crabs were too salty and dry, oysters were tasteless and Lobsters were mushy. The lobsters ruined our appetite. We barely finish one lobster.   Two stars - one for our awesome waitress and the other star for the super cute desserts!",

Honestly if you're going to spend $140 per person (tax and tip), you might as well go somewhere nice and have a sit down dinner. Prime rib was like any other prime rib I've had at a buffet the lobster was disappointing and so were the crab legs and oysters. On top of that for being a buffet, if you really think about it they probably had about 20 options (maybe less) (excluding dessert), I could probably name them all if I had to.  Point is, it ain't all that great, there are other great buffets in Vegas!",

Don't get me wrong, all food has quality such as lobster tails, king crab, cocktail prawn, prime rib, filet mignon, etc. but unfortunately none of them taste good, and we definitely feel like the chef there wasted all the good quality food. Lobster it was either over cooked or under cooked, and the meat is mushy, king crab is over cooked, prime rib is tasteless, filet is over cooked, mean well done filet mignon.... on the other hand, any food item that not require prep is better such as oyster and cocktail prawn. Sushi presentation is very bad, just like the Chinese buffet, and caviar, they just use whatever container to present it.   Service was great, very experienced and attentive server.  I don't think I will return to sterling brunch nor recommend this to anyone",

    "text": "Oh Sterling Brunch, I wanted to love you, but you sorely disappointed me.   My husband and brother-in-law came here on a Sunday afternoon. We showed up 10 mins early to our 1:00PM reservation that I booked over the phone. (I recommend calling bc sometimes OpenTable doesn't have an accurate count of the reservations available.) The hostess seated us at our table right at 1:00PM, which is a plus. The place is located in Bally's.   Now let's talk about the important parts of the experience.   FOOD   The buffet had limited options. We tried the following:   1. Lobster Tail: They're big, juicy and easy to eat. Out of the entire meal, this was by far my favorite item to enjoy at Sterling's. I didn't dip it in butter. I recommend topping it w/ caviar instead Yumm!  2. Lobster Bisque: The bisque is creamy, but don't let it sit out too long or it'll get gross. Eat the soup right away or you'll be disappointed with it.  3. Raw Oysters in a half shell: Not fresh at all and it had a weird taste to it. Could've been the season or we came too late and the good oysters were gone. (This place closes at 2:30 pm)  4. Lamb: Tender and flavorful, especially when you add the mint julep jelly on top.  5. Prime Rib: The outside is too salty (saltier than other steakhouses I've tried). The meat was tender.  6. King Crab Legs: These things were huge and PRICKLY! It was so hard to crack these to get to the meat. Maybe I'm not a King Crab Leg type of gal.  7. Cocktail Shrimp: Meh. It's good, but nothing special.  8. Truffle Mashed Potatoes: DELICIOUS! It tasted amazing with the lamb and prime rib.  9. Caviar: Tasty, not too salty and it went well with the lobster tail and bread.  10. Filet Mignon with a butter sauce on top: The meat was perfectly cooked. :-)  11. Desserts:  The portions were great for tasting. We tried them all. My favorite is the peanut butter one. Sorry I can't give you more insight on the desserts!  12. Bottomless mimosas: The champagne is very dry so I recommend if you like a more sweeter champagne then you should get mimosas. You can get unlimited OJ and other refreshments as well. (They don't offer Coke; only Pepsi.)   They also served sushi... that was questionable and looked dry. They were rice packed rolls with limited sushi grade fish inside. You're better off saving your stomach for the better tasting items like the lobster tail and bisque.   PRICE   For two people, it came out to $200 with a $40 tip = $240. I feel like I would've been happier with this price had I known what to foods to eat or stay away from. When you come here, make sure you drink PLENTY OF WATER so you can drink as much champagne w/o getting too intoxicated. Go for the Lobster tail, caviar, shrimp, lamb and prime rib FIRST. However, the food doesn't taste good when it's cold.   I recommend grabbing two/three things at one time, then bring it back to the table to enjoy while it's warm. Then go up for another round. Don't grab everything at once!   SERVICE   This is the primary reason why I didn't enjoy Sterling. Our server had a very sarcastic and dry sense of humor. I'm not sure why he thought it was okay to keep telling me \"no\" when I asked for anything while still bringing me what I asked for... It's absurd. He didn't even smile to hint that he was joking each time he did it! He had a mean, aggravated look on his face. If he only did it a few times, then okay.   BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!   I have a dry sense of humor. Sarcasm could be my middle name. BUT, there is a time and a place.   This server seriously needed to be taught emotional intelligence. He didn't understand that the entire table was over his antics and \"humorous\" rudeness. If I ever come back here again, I will make sure to not get this server.   When you're paying this much for a meal, you assume to have a good time. Not feel uncomfortable.   Overall, I give this place 3-stars. The food is 4 stars, service is 2 stars and price is 3 stars.   Happy Dining,  J Tran",

Plenty of lobster tails - dry, plenty of crab claws - watery and completely flavorless, plenty of coffee - horrible quality, sushi - Chinese buffet quality.  What a disappointment.  The best thing was the puff bread they served at the table and the bread pudding was OK.  Bloody Mary sucked you know what!  Service was very iffy and I had to flag down our guy two or three times before I could get my water!!  I rather spend twice as much and get quality or half as much as get the same elsewhere without the lobster.  What a shame, what a sham.",

We had sample several trays but still each one of the lobster we tasted were mushy.  The oysters were not very fresh and the sushi were like the super market variety.  The rice was gummy and the fish pieces were such thin slices, could not distinguish one from the other.  The caviar was way too salty and fishy.  The crab shell were hard to dismantle so it was not easy to eat.  The best seafood was the shrimp, large and succulent.  The prime rib and lamb chops were also delicious.  Lastly, the deserts were mediocre.  For the price that we paid, we expected a lot more!",

    "text": "I've always heard about Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, but never Sterling Brunch.  I told a friend that I was going to be in Vegas for the weekend and he recommended Sterling.    He was like, \"Dude, they have caviar and lobster tails.\"  \"Word?\"  \"Yeah.\"  The Sterling Brunch is located at BLT Steak in the Bally's hotel, so don't go looking for a restaurant called \"Sterling Brunch\" like I did.  Also, make a reservation because it gets completely booked and is only available on Sundays (I believe).  Anyways, who doesn't like champagne and caviar?  The best part is that it is UNLIMITED.  The caviar isn't of the highest quality, but what do you really expect if it's unlimited?  I used it as a condiment more than anything.  Also, our server was topping us off throughout our meal.  My glass was never empty.  They also just launched their Bloody Mary bar (unlimited)!  It was kind of a pain though because there wasn't always a bartender available.  I'll let it slide since it was their first time, but appreciated that they had an array of toppings like pepperoni, salami, bacon, carrots, and etc.  They offered premium seafood options like beautifully prepared lobster tails, stone crab, king crab, and poached jumbo prawns.  YAAAAAS!  They offer eggs benedict to order.  Top that bish off with some more caviar.  My only complaint is that their options (buffet-wise) is somewhat limited compared to other buffets available in Vegas.  Dessert was alright, but the $95 price tag for everything else was well worth it.  Get down with your bad and boujee self.",

Service was very good and attentive.  However the lobster was terribly undercooked and the prime rib was greasy.  The desserts were good but nothing worth the $100 price tag.

If you are just going to go for the champagne, and you didn't know how good this place used to be, then you might have a good time. We didn't feel like drinking, and were not offered anything but water. You will wait in a long line for a small selection of rubbery and dried out lobster, over cooked and under seasoned filet (there is no salt or pepper to be found at your table either), and mealy & watery crab claws and legs. There will be plenty of shell fragments in your food as the lobster is not cleaned properly, and the legs and claws are difficult to split with the tools given. The bananas foster bread pudding and omelets were good. There is a pitiful excuse for a dessert selection. Our waiter made himself scarce, did not ask how we were, or if we wanted anything else to drink besides water. He also didn't notice that we were done eating, so after five minutes we had to go to the front to request a bill. The host sent the waiter to us, who then acted surprised when we said we didn't enjoy the meal. At $238 for two - plus an undeserved tip, it is not worth it. Save your money and go to Bouchon, the Wynn, or the Four Seasons' Veranda for your breakfast. All offer better value, food, and service.",

There was ayce lobster, but when it's broiled and then sitting under a heat lamp. It becomes super dry! It would have been way better if they offered a steamed lobster option so that it kept the lobster to not dry out. I also didn't like the fact that the crab legs were not split in half and they were so hard to crack open and eat. I tried the filet to see what it was all about too, but it was also over cooked and had a weird gamey taste to it that I couldn't even eat.   We sat at the bar area when they told us the whole restaurant was full, but I noticed a bunch of tables that were empty and they just didn't clean. The service at the bar was amazing. They were really nice and def did not skip a beat in attending to us.   I would definitely not go back to this buffet, it did not meet my expectations considering the price of this buffet.",

We arrived a half hour early for our reservation (currently a two to three month wait). The hostess asked if we cared for champagne while we waited? Why yes, yes I do care for that. Not long after we were shown to our table. Handsome waiters in tuxes. Perrier Jouet champagne flowing freely. The atmosphere is lively and you feel something special is going to happen.   Many have commented on the menu, yes it appears more limited but EVERYTHING is special and most items very delicately prepared. The only complaint I had were the Alaskan king crabs are not split, just scored, and those suckers hurt try's nag to manipulate the briny sweet meat out of them. I suppose they can't do everything or we'd never leave. Final pro tip: save the bread pudding French toast with carmelized bananas for dessert instead of the dessert offerings.   The silver spoon has been ripped from my mouth. Thank you Sterling for an opulent and unforgettable experience!",

The restaurant was pretty crowded when I got there. Not too many people were waiting to be seated. However that quickly changed and the line to check in soon got pretty long.  Let me start by saying the selection is pretty impressive. Sushi, lobster, king crab, scampi, oysters, crab claws, chilled shrimp, filet mignon, rack of lamb, prime rib, slabs of bacon, and an array of breakfast items including a omelet station. There was also a dessert station as well. Unlimited champagne and mimosas. What a bargain for $125 per person right?  Unfortunately the hype did not match my expectations. The lobster was so-so. The filet mignon although soft lacked any flavor. The king crab and rack of lamb was ok. The slab bacon was very flavorful but fatty. The bread pudding french toast was also good.  Maybe my expectations were too high but for the price they charge I thought the quality should have been a lot better. Just my humble opinion.",

Where do I even begin?  -There's a wait, even with reservation. -The booth I was sitting at felt like it's a deflated balloon. I had to force myself to sit higher just to reach the table (this never happens anywhere else) -It was so dimly lit inside, could barely see. (See my picture attached) -Server didn't come for the first 10 minutes, so  we were confused on what to do. Ended up just getting up to get food after waiting awhile. -All of the seafood were meh. -Oysters were tiny and not fresh. Had a weird taste it. -Lobster tails were THE WORST!!!! Wtf? It was so MUSHY!!! We got a few tails thinking they were good. We forced ourselves to eat one each just so our money \"wouldn't go to waste\". Ended up spitting out the rest. All of the tails we got were so soft and wet. Gross consistency.  -We had to clean our own plates and stacked it up ourselves because server left it there for 30 minutes. -Lobster ravioli was not good. -Filet mignon was meh. -Tried everything else to see if it was better than the seafood. -Sadly everything else was shit. -Waffles were super thick. All I could taste was batter. -The fruits were good. But again, they're fruits. -Sashimi had about a pound of rice per piece of fish. How offensive.  -Desserts were okay. Not worth the price. -Did I mention price? Yeah, it was a whopping $125/person!!!!! Not counting tax and tips.   HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY CHARGING $125/person FOR GROSS FOOD? WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THE LOBSTER TAILS?   If you're going here for the lobster tails, please just do yourself a favor and go to Costco and cook it yourself. At least it won't taste like mashed lobster tails.  The best things here were the unlimited orange juice, bread, and fruits.",

I will say the food was decent and offered a lot of seafood as they always have. Sushi was lacking but overall decent. However when it's $125 per person before tax and tip I do not expect to ask for water or champagne refills. I mean that's the point of going was the bottomless champagne it's assumed you would refill them. Our server was nice but nice didn't refill my water or bubbles glass.  Secondly for over $320 for two people (and that's with only a 15% tip when the minimum they recommend is 18%) I would think the place should have its own bathroom.  We used a casino bathroom which I had to notify security of a half dead lady passed out on the toilet non responsive with her pants down! Classy! Thirdly the service to clear our plates was extremely slow I sat with dirty plate in front of me for 20 minutes and the table next to us sat dirty for almost an hour. Over all I recommend passing on this place for that kind of money you can buy lots of higher end champagne bottles and Uber eats a meal to your home.",

The lobster tail was descent, nothing game changer, except for the fact thats theres caviar to be added! The steaks and the lamb were really good.

    "text": "My friends and I enjoyed this festival of gluttony this past Sunday.  Here's what y'all need to know:  This buffet has far less variety than others in Vegas.  It is strictly focused on serving well-prepared specialty items.  If you love lobster, king crab, fresh-sliced bacon, and/or prime rib, you will EASILY eat $125' worth, probably in your first sitting.    So, do not waste this trip on dining companions who prefer the kitschy Vegas buffet experience, with 50 different items in bright colors with trendy names.  When we went, they were serving Nicolas Feuillatte, as opposed to the Perrier Jouet pictured in some other reviews.  No complaints!  This meal is served in the BLT steakhouse at Bally's.  It's nice enough, but a bit dark for brunch.  That may be intentional, because I certainly started to get sleepier with each glass of bubbly and bite of buttered lobster meat.  I tapped out after my 3rd plate (excluding dessert, of course).  The service is delightful, so consider tipping somewhere between standard buffet tip and full-service tip, if not a full 18-20%.  Honestly, it's hard to describe the experience as a whole.  I didn't expect to get in at all, because we didn't have a reservation.  So I didn't have time to prepare my mind or my soul.    Every moment was kind of like when Little Orphan Annie first gets to Daddy Warbucks mansion and she's just looking around, taking it all in, each luxurious feature besting the last.  It's overwhelming, and yet . . . feels just right.  Like home.  A home built of juicy bacon and lobster tails and the ACTUALLY BOTTOMLESS glass of champagne.  Share it with the ones you love.  As long as they're not basic eaters.",

This is a really small intimate buffet reminiscent of an old Vegas steakhouse. All you can eat lobster, king crab, and caviar is what sets this place apart. Now, I set a goal to eat as much of the lobster and caviar as possible, but I have to be honest. The king crab was way overcooked (to the point where the meat inside is tiny), the oysters were a bit dry and old and gritty, and the lobster was really dry. So I guess with quantity, you cannot have quality, even at $100 a person. But that didn't stop me from eating 10 lobster tails(set a new personal best)... At one point I was using caviar as a sauce for the lobster. Then I switched to using lobster bisque as a sauce.   I ate so much lobster and caviar that I had to deal with some stomach issues I've never had before a few hours after hahaha.   Service here is very excellent, similar to what you would have at a high end steakhouse. I was very impressed. All in all, is it the best seafood... No. Is it the best buffet... No. But, it is something that should be experienced at least once especially if you are a seafood loving glutton like myself.",

I planned a few months in advance and was able to score a reservation on open table for 4 people.  A week or so prior, a couple of our friends wanted to join us for the weekend.  I was able to call the restaurant on a Saturday evening when they were open as BLT and spoke to a super friendly lady about upping our reservation to 6.    She was able to accommodate us without any issues and I almost squealed over the phone.  Thank goodness!    Ok backing up.  This spot is only open on Sundays. It's located inside Bally's.  You need a reservation.  They have some counter spots but I hear it's pretty tough to get seats.  While you're waiting for your table, sip on some bubbly.  Plan ahead.  It isn't cheap.  It's probably the most expensive buffet in Vegas.  At around $100/pp, you're getting unlimited champagne (and it's the good stuff), lobster, filet mignon, prime rib, caviar, and other items.  The buffet isn't huge but the quality is better than most.    I went straight for the lobster.  These are monstrous tails and definitely worth a 2nd visit back to the bar if you can consume it.  The champagne pours were endless.  Our server was on it and kept pouring even after we had paid for our check.    Had a fantastic experience here and everyone left happy.  I'd recommend trying it at least once if you can get a reservation.",

There was a line for the lobster tails and the only downfall to the lobster tails was they tend to overcook it so it was a little mushy. I loved the lamb chops and the cocktail shrimp. The oyster didn't look appetizing and although I didn't try the crab, I heard great things about it! Don't bother trying the sushi, the rice was hard. They also had caviar, which they serve with mini pancakes and it was yummy. Not sure if I would come back since it is on the pricier side of the spectrum, but it was definitely an experience.",

    "text": "Underwhelming is the word of the day. We waited 4 months to try Sterling Brunch due to the outrageous reservation list. We were soo excited to finally try what was supposed to be the best buffet in town, but were sorely disappointed. Firstly, the buffet is actually really small. There's one buffet line, 3 dessert tables, and a bloody mary bar...that's it. Our first plate we loaded with lobster tail, filet mignon, and oysters. Lobster was rubbery and overcooked, filet mignon and oysters were tasteless. For the sushi, I could find better quality at an ayce restaurant. Dessert was actually decent and we didn't get a chance to try the bloody mary bar. We also felt that we were neglected service due to our age. Our server made conversations to other guests and even joked with them, while we weren't even notified that mimosas were included with our meal. For a place that charges $125 per  person, I felt like we were completely cheated. Everything looked better than it actually tasted. Definently not worth it, spend your money elsewhere.",

Few points on what was missing for me -the setting of the place did not feel like an elegant brunch.  It was dim.. like a steakhouse, no open windows, no fancy decorations... with TV's around the place... not a feeling of WOW this is extravagant. - the lobster was mediocre.  It's literally broiled lobster tails and mushy.. i wish they had something more than just clarified butter and caviar to go with it - the actual quantity of the items at the buffet was quite limited.  It was like a set of 20 items.. not your typical vegas buffet with like 50+ selections  Good parts -Chimichurri lamb chops were super good.. topping it with caviar brought it to the next level.  I probably ate 6 of these -The popover was amazing - crunchy soft savory -Lobster benedict was also really delicious.. with caviar -King crab legs are always delicious",

    "text": "\"Pleasure without champagne is purely artificial.\" - Oscar Wilde  Sometimes in life you have to spoil yourself and enjoy all the seafood and caviar you can eat. And when those moments occur, it is time to visit the Sterling Brunch.    We waited three months for a reservation. The price tag is $95 per person with all you can eat and all you can drink champagne Sunday Brunch.  I would go with at least some champagne drinkers and a hungry stomach.  The Sterling Brunch is located at the Bally's Buffet and it is hidden in BLT Steak House.  Be sure to tip your server to get the champagne flowing.  When you are in Las Vegas, you have to roll in with the finest foods.  I would recommend trying it at least once.  They only open on Sundays from 9:30 am - 2:30 pm.  Make reservations for a guaranteed spot.",

We finally got in and were most excited to grub on the lobster, caviar , dessert and champagne.  The brunch layout was small which I liked. You know that they focus on the important details like cooking the lobster right. There were a couple of seafood options, hearty brunch options, and a vegetable/fruit/sushi area. You could also order a couple of dishes from the server, like the lobster egg Benedict.  We stuck with the buffet and grabbed several servings of lobster, lobster ravioli and the dessert. The champagne kept pouring all day and the desserts were great.  The best part was the service, which as you can imagine was superb. At the end of brunch they handed each lady a rose and then even came around and showered us with rose petals. It was a great experience...still very expensive but great to try at least once.",

The champagne has changed , no longer pouriet jouet.  Lobster ravioli and prime rib were good.  Crab legs good  (we brought a pair of crab cutting scissors which worked like a charm!)  shrimp cocktail a bit on the raw side!

He even helped my sister open some of her crab legs when he saw her struggling!   When we first arrived our waiter opened a brand new champagne bottle which felt super personal.   The food options we were limited but very very good. I especially enjoyed the lobster, crab legs, and pop overs! Bloody Mary was great too! I also loved the chocolate dipped strawberries!  What made this place great was that they never pressured us to leave. We arrived at 10:30 and stayed until 1:30!   The only reason I took away a star is that the price had jumped from what I read online to $125! I was not expecting the price to be so high! With tip and tax my poor wallet was suffering.",

Tried to make reservation, said they were booked, encouraged to just show up. Enough open tables that we were seated  quickly. Got fresh popovers which was nice treat. Lots of items now must be requested from \"kitchen\". Service very slow and clumsy. Huge lobster tails lacked sweet flavor, crab legs weren't bad, seabass came is serving dish. Too large of portion which encouraged sharing. Tuna Tar Tar was finally received after long wait from kitchen. Very tasty but again big portion. If I wanted to order from kitchen or share I would have went to restaurant. Instead I went to high price buffet to be disappointed. I suggest ordering items from kitchen off of tiniest print menu. Makes you think they hope you don't order... Get a few items, just to try. They're large enough for table to share. Champagne refills were slow and wait staff oblivious to removing plates. Desserts were small snippets of sweet French pastries. At least that's what menu said. Waitress knocked coffee cup over while asking me to sign bill. More concerned with bill then coffee spilling on pants. Definitely consider other options.",

    "text": "This is the most expensive meal I've had in a while. At $85 a person I was expecting EVERYTHING to be damn delicious, especially since their food selection wasn't massive. I don't mind if there are fewer choices but PLEASE, make it good! This just wasn't the case.   Problems:   -The eggs benedict was not served right. The tray they kept it in was very warm and probably continued to cook the eggs until basically it tasted and had the consistency of hard boiled eggs. Eggs benedict is nothing without the runny yolk.  -The lobster bisque was not good; it didn't have a strong lobster taste at all. If the \"lobster bisque\" name card wasn't there, I wouldn't have known what the heck it was. It's also served in a tall cylinder and they don't provide a place to put the lid. The soup handle was also steaming hot and burned my hand! :(  -I've had comparable or better lamb with less fat on it.  -After I took a bite out of my steak, I asked my bf where the filet mignon was. He said, \"you're eating it\". Need I say more? -Maybe this is my problem but what's the big deal about the caviar? It tastes like tiny salty balls. I didn't experience any other flavors. I guess I just don't know how to eat it... If you're like me and not really used to caver, I'm pretty sure you won't be falling out of your seat with that \"OMG this is delicious\" feeling either.  -The orange juice was served in the smallest cups I've never used while dining out so obviously one gulp and it was done. Our server was not as fast on refilling as some other yelpers experienced. We had to remind him a couple of times.   Highlights:   -Obviously the unlimited lobster had to be one of them. They were served as halves with hot butter. I'm not normally head over heels about lobster but the ones here were very flavorful and soft. Definitely the best ones I've had! However, my bf wished the meat was a little more firm. He's the lobster lover and this brunch was more for him. Sorry hun!  -Very fresh oysters and crab! Not for one moment did I question if I'd get sick like I do at Rio's seafood buffet. :P  -The desserts were as beautiful as they were delicious! SOO many times it happens that buffets have very pretty desserts so you load up a big plate, only to be extremely disappointed! At Sterling, almost every dessert I tried was great. I mistakenly picked up the lemon meringue tart (not a fan) but it was delicious! Fluffy, airy meringue and there was a sweet lemon flavor that didn't overpower the tart at all. You could taste the attention that went into it and all the layers of the tart.   The only dessert  that I didn't like was the chocolate dipped strawberry covered in pistachios. The nuts weren't as crunchy as fresh ones would be, way more chewy than expected. The chocolate could have been better quality too.  Would I come back? For this price, I think I'd rather go to a fancy restaurant than to a fancy buffet.",

I have been waiting to go but too expensive by far; $90 a person. Not too many people have heard of it but it is the claimed premier brunch in town for many years running. Groupon had a two for one so I went ahead and did it for this holiday weekend. We went last night. My verdict is; not worth it. There is lobster, cavier, crab legs and claws, rack of lamb, sushi, oysters and other dishes. The lobster was pretty decent, not rubbery. I guess if you love cavier it would be worth it. The deserts left much to be desired as well. Like they thought you would be so full you wouldn't want it anyway. We had a reservation but still waited 45 minutes because we \"had a Groupon\" which means we didn't \"rate\". The Maitre d actually told me their 4 and 5 star guests get top priority!  Maybe we were supposed to tip the manager but at $90 I wasn't so inclined and thought those days were over. Guess not, lol. Anyway, that is my review. Good, but Planet Hollywood and The M casino are right up there for way less money. The Rio has lobster, so I will see how they are. Haven't been there in years.",

This is not one of those overly stocked buffets with a million choices that make no sense but what is there is amazing!  I must have had 2 bottles of champagne on my own, so right there the price is justified (to me at least!) but then I had almost 2 full lobsters, alaskan crab claws, belgian waffles, prime rib and all of it was quality!  Well one of my lobster halves was stringy and not good but the rest was perfect.  The waiters were so happy and jovial, the service was amazing, anything we asked for we got asap, the rest of the staff were very accommodating and when they would run out of lobsters or anything else, I didn't have to wait more than 2 minutes for them to refill, and that includes champagne refills, they were not stingy there!!  I highly recommend this buffet but don't go if you don't eat shellfish or drink champagne, because then it will be a waste of your money!    A few tips, make a reservation, if you don't, they stick you in the side restaurant so you have to walk through 2 restaurants and back to get your food and they say the dress is business casual but it's really more casual than that, we saw lots of people in sneakers and otherwise dressed down.",

We discovered the sterling from one of my customers about 10 years ago , and have dined there a least once a year since. Our first time there we received VIP treatment and we were not even guest in the hotel.  I believe this is one reason the Sterling Sunday brunch has been so popular, in addition to French champagne, broiled lobster tails, king crab legs, oysters, huge cocktail shrimp, lobster bisque, very tasty sushi. These are choices I go for first.  And there are many other items like the carving station, fish, sides and top notch deserts. We dined there last Sat. and had a great  time.   We will miss the Bally's steakhouse old Las Vegas charm and we can get that for you service. Example.  A few yeas ago my wife had been looking forward to the creme brulee but it was dropped from the menu so she mentioned  it to the waiter, he went to the kitchen and talk to the chef to see what he could do. The chef opened the the dinner desert  case and brought out this huge creme brulee . I have many stories I could tell about the service at the old sterling.   Now the new sterling, the food is the same quality as before.  The service was as what you would expect in a fine steakhouse. Plates cleared , glasses did not go dry. There was one issue I had, I  asked for a wet towel to clean my hands after eating crab and it seems they do not provide this to the customers so bring your own. This is our favorite brunch so we will be back next year.   We will also give the BLT steak a try.",

    "text": "The food was spectacular!  It's got a bit of everything for everyone.  I helped myself to several plates of fresh oysters and cracked crab claws, both of which were excellent.  Also,  lobster ravioli was the best I've ever had anywhere, period.  They even had roasted lobster tail which one of the main reasons that we went.  Delicious!  I wasn't extremely hungry when we got there but I couldn't stop going back for plate after plate!  The desserts were awesome with some of the best chocolate covered strawberries I've ever had.   On a side note, with all the food available, we nearly forget about the caviar!  It didn't help that they don't put it out with all the other food but you have to ask the person behind the buffet line for it specifically.  So if you plan on trying the caviar,  make sure not to forget like we almost did and ask for it!",

    "text": "Little did I know this place was going to cost me $85 bucks. I was going in prepared to pay $65-70 but $85 was a bit too much and definitely not worth it hence the star reduction. Reasons for star reduction: 1) oysters looked disgusting. yes it was nice that it was offered and i would have been eat ting them up. but these look like they'd make you sick and they didn't look fresh at all 2) lobster wasn't coming out fast enough. there was always a 10-15 minute wait to get to the lobster! which wastes your precious eating time 3) the dining room is separated. they use two restaurants to house the sterling brunch. the steakhouse and another restaurant. we got sat in the other one, i think it was Italian. so we had to walk pretty far to get to the food. i was quite disappointed with this 4) had to wait 15 minutes with a reservation when the waiting list without one was 15-20 minutes. whats the point of the reservation? and we still got a crappy seat  Why its at least 4 stars 1) the lobster, when you actually got it it was fab. 2) champagne was unlimited and Delicious. a bit slow on the refills but still nice to have. and when he did refill he only gave me half a glass even when i asked for a full glass. i thought that was rude. 3) they had chocolate cover strawberries as dessert- MY FAV! 4) lamb was good and not super gamey  5) shrimp cocktail 6) caviar by request   overall. i feel like they didn't refill the foods fast enough. there was always a wait for something and the setup of the food made it so that the line for the lobster [at the end] block all the other foods [crab legs prime rib]  super excited to go and thoroughly disappointed. even the desserts weren't refilled that quick.  not worth $85 bucks I'd like to go again and give this place a second chance if it went back to $65",

I agree with VA F. that it is too bad the price went up AND the quality went down a bit.  The unlimited high quality alcohol is probably the real justification for the price. Make a reservation - the wait can be long.  However, they've opened up 2 adjacent restaurants for seating room, so it is no so bad anymore.  You just have to walk a ways to the food. So, the best part about this buffet is the great champagne and sake.  Very high quality.  You need to keep drinking to make sure it is worth the price (like cheng K, who finished 3 bottles! amazing.)  I can only manage 1 bottle and several sake shots. One time I had some pasta with real truffled sauce - it was heavenly. Unlimited caviar - though I don't think I like it too much.  The lobsters they have are the cheaper 1/2 pounders - presplit so all the favors are leeched out.",

The best thing I ate were the crab claws.  They were so sweet. I'm sure the champagne was good, but I don't really drink.  The only alcoholic beverage that I do drink are pina colada and daiquiri.  Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be back.  There are better buffets that are a lot cheaper.",

There was no line when I went but maybe because it was close to closing... and we didn't have to eat for the rest of the day because we were so full.",

Champagne is available while you wait and, with reservations, the wait isn't long. Soon enough you'll be escorted into the dining room. From that point on, your champagne glass won't dip below a sip or two without the ace crack staff refilling it (what else to do in Vega$ but get loaded on a Sunday morning?!?).  The brunch is a total delight. I usually abstain from brunches because I can't eat enough of the mediocre fare to justify the entry fee. This is entirely different. A unique and fabulous selection awaits you. The highlights are the lobster (tails! claws! sweet and tender), the caviar (ask about it at the sushi bar) and the tremendous dessert ROOM.  Yes, this is THE life. Expensive as it might be ($75 per person), this spectacular experience is well worth the money!!!!",

Yes the waitstaff''s service was still very attentive and the champagne was still Perrier Jouet.  But those were the only things that remained from the old beloved Sterling Brunch that I've been coming to and raving about for the past 7 years!  I've brought my mom and her friends, all are TR Diamond and 7Stars members, everytime we go to Vegas (which is way too often!).  They have enjoyed it so much, they've been bring their friends and family.  This time I brought a colleague and friend and the experience was hugely embarassing!  Just about all the seafood was oversalted (from lobster bisque to crab legs) and all the meats were way over cooked.  The lobster tails were 1/3 the size they used to be, and overcooked, dry and salty.  The crab \"legs\" were more like left over scraps from the spread of the old Sterling.  The \"chilean\" sea bass was dry and salty.  The Filet mignon was so overdone it's inedible.  The lamb chops were completely brown and tough.  There was no sushi.  No duck.  Desserts selections were also pathetic.  No crepe station.  No ice cream. No creme brule.  Overall there were only 1/2 the selections of food and at 1/4 of the quality.  It is now a waaaayyyyy overpriced mediocre buffet living off its past reputation.  Unless management raised the bar back up to pre-remodel/rename, I will not ever be back and would discourage friends and family from doing so.",

Waking up still drunk from the essential heavy drinking and dancing, I also woke up to the drunk munchies which lead me to Sterling Brunch. 85 washingtons, and all worth it.  Service:  I love how they offer champagne @ the entrance. With some champagne re-fueling my party tank, we were seated immediately with napkins placed on our laps & all.  Service was spectacular of course. The waiters were a lot more personable here. Very cool of them to joke around with us, or maybe knew we were intoxicated.. Glad they brought their sense of humor with them to brunch... either ways, brunch here was fun and elegant. There are also chefs manning each cutting table, and a lot of staff discretely running in and out of the kitchen refreshing the very popular seafood and egg dishes, respectively.  Foooooood:  This is why it cost 85 dollars a pop.   The quality of the food is seriously top notch. No joke about it. Fresh Oysters, Quality cut meats, Lobster, and many MANY more! The buffet is not extraordinarily huge, but the finite selection offered is seriously the top tier of foods available in vegas. The eggs benedict, baked or broiled lobster, shrimp cocktail and filet mignon seems to be the most popular. But don't forget the HUGE dessert bar. They have a variety of chocolate dipped strawberries (YUMMMM; pistachios, oreo, chocolate, white chocolate), cakes, parfaits, tarts, and other fruity/chocolaty sweet concoctions.   Hands down the Best BRUNCH in TOWN & Highly Recommended!",

The brunch is only on Sunday's, so make sure you make a reservation. Our server was friendly, courteous, constantly around to serve us with whatever we needed (esp. taking away our used plates and filling our champagne glasses).  He was really a wonderful server.  The buffet itself offered more than enough of selections to please anyone. The seafood was exceptional! From the crab legs, lobster and shrimp. Hubby feasted on the sushi and filet mignon, among a lot of other foods. It's a bit pricey ($90), but it's something you should try if in Vegas. Plus the endless glasses of champagne made the brunch perfect! My only complaint, if I had to have one, would be that our seating was at 1:30pm, and didn't realize that they closed down the food at 2:30pm. Luckily we were finished, but I would've liked to have known that, incase I wanted more. The desserts stayed out though, and we were never rushed out of there at all.  Very relaxing and we all enjoyed it very much. When I head back to Vegas I will go there again.",

However, at Denny's I can order more and more and more and more and still pay less than this!

    "text": "For many years I have heard that this was the best buffet in Vegas.  Last month, I found out that it is True.  At $85 a person, I had hoped to be disapointed so that I wouldn't have to ever consider paying that much for a buffet again. Unfortunately, I am now going to have to save my money so I can come here on every Vegas trip.  This is probably the smallest buffet in Vegas, but had everything I love to eat.  The lobster tails were my favorite part.  I loved that they were full lobster tails.  I didn't have to deal with the rest of the lobster.  The tails were 5-7 ounces and were nothing like the miniature half tails that you get at the Rio seafood buffet. I more than covered the price of the buffet alone in lobster tails.  Filet mignon was great. King Crab legs were awesome! Prime rib, veal, mashed potatoes were all good.  My wife loved the fruit in jello with grand marnier. The chocolate covered strawberries were super.  I got to try caviar for the first time.  It will also be my last.  Good for you if you like caviar, but my wife and I both hated it.  I hate the taste of alcohol, but I figured that fancy, expensive champagne must taste good.  It tasted just as gross to me as a bottle of champagne from the 99 cent store.  My wife and I stayed here for close to 2 hours, when we normally stay around an hour at any other buffet.  Sure, the price is almost twice the price of the 24hr buffet pass, but I really couldn't eat anymore the next day and a half anyway.  The service is also really great here. While we were there, one of the servers, or maybe a manager, walked over to Paris to get some macaroons for the kids at one of the tables near us.  The only dilema we had was how much to tip. On one hand, it is a buffet, but on the other it is a fine dining experience.  We went with the fine dining experience tip, since we would be returning.",

    "text": "Holy Jesus, Mary, and Joseph:  This is the single greatest buffet... ever.  Of course the value of the $85/person price tag is going to be tied to how much you eat and whether your reeeeeallly like seafood, but if you're like me...  BTW:  I decided to write this review anecdotally, so forgive my indulgence.  Let's start with the fact that the world's greatest buffet is at Ballys.  BALLYS?: Yes, I know it's at Bally's which makes this whole experience a bit out of place.  No matter - when we approached the restaurant, things got quieter and the atmosphere began to change, starting with the patron's apparel.  Around the restaurant, people were suddenly wearing golfing outfits, collared shirts, and pleated well-pressed pants.  It reminded me of the oasis that is the Steakhouse at Circus Circus.   When we walked in, we were immediately served champagne.  This usually rings hollow to most foodies being that the champagne is usually two-buck-chuck... but this was Perrier Jouet!  Hell - my wife and I drank this after I'd proposed to her.  As we were seated, we were offered beverages other than our delicious champagne.  Coffee & Orange Juice please.  A glass & a cup appeared and lo-and-behold. the OJ was FRESH SQUEEZED and the coffee was smooooooooth - not at all sour or bitter.  Things were lookin' awesome.   THE BUFFET: I know what you're thinking.  And you're right.  I hate buffets.  I've been to the Bellagio Buffet, the Le Village Buffet, the Wynn Buffet, the Rio Seafood Buffet, blah blah blah.  I've got news for you.  They're all marginal-to-moderately good.  (although the Rio's gone into the toilet over the past few years)  The other three are okay and have their strengths.  They have reasonable quality and you're not going to get sick at any of them but you're not going to come away with an OMG-thatwassogood reaction.   This was completely different:  None of the aforementioned buffets even comes close to the Sterling Brunch - it's simply in a class of it's own.  The buffet literally glows under the warm incandescent lamps above.  Here's a list of the things that I sampled from this embarrassment of riches that laid before me.   - Hot gourmet-prepared Lobsters  - Caviar with toast, blini, creme fraiche, onions, egg crumbles, & chives  - Steamed Alaskan King Crab legs  - Prime Rib with Au Jus & 3 different types of horseradish  - Rack of Lamb with Mint Jelly  - Extremely fresh fruit on ice including watermelon, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and various melon slices  - Huge shrimp... I mean really large prawns... with cocktail sauce  - Shucked oysters on ice  - Omelets ready-to-order with sausage, mushrooms, green onions, and a variety of other ingredients  - Sushi of all sorts (Didn't eat any of this)  - Lox & Bagels (Didn't eat any of this either)  ...and a lot more that I didn't look at.  Here's the menu if you want to see it: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.harrahs.com%2Fimages%2FProperty%2Fblv%2Fdining%2FBLV_SterlingBrunch_Menu.pdf&s=5c076ccf1f469c4d0f2d5a6d1899b50dd5efccc568daee4948ce6705f0511096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">harrahs.com/images/Prope...</a>  Normally, at a buffet - the shrimp are some of the first things you 'hit'.  In this case, they were the absolute LAST things we tried.  No joke.  I mean, heck - we figured, you can get shrimp anywhere.   Understand, it was really hard not to just 'pig out'.  What with all the champagne being poured and fresh coffee being decanted, and the bottomless glass of fresh squeezed, sweet orange juice that I was being spoiled with, I really couldn't tell you what I was doing other than stuffing my face and pretending I was a Roman Emperor.  One thing I can recommend is for everyone to be selective about what you get.  It'll be there later when you want to try it - they don't run out.   In all seriousness, any one of these buffet items would have been worthy of a delicious paid for meal in-of-itself.  I told my wife that I could sit and gorge myself on the lobster alone it was sooooo sweet, soft, hot, and did I mention they had an endless supply of melted butter to go with the endless supply of lobster?   But no, the thing that I spent the most time with was the caviar.  I love caviar.    (I had so much to write about my first experience at the Sterling Brunch that it exceeded the 5000 char limit of Yelp.  I ended up writing a blog post about this, the environment, the desserts, and a little more about the caviar, so if you're interested in reading more: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkurtsthoughts.spaces.live.com%2Fblog%2Fcns%2197895BBB8AD10F37%21956.entry&s=67609d3fbb99f654b351a89a39920565620dd879cdd0357216f94d7013291423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kurtsthoughts.spaces.liv...</a> )  CONCLUSION: I think it's safe to say that this will forever be on my list of places to go in Vegas from here on out.  It's only available on Sundays, but I think it will be well worth it to \"stick around\" on Sundays to go to the brunch before heading to the airport.    This is truly the \"One Meal to Rule them All\".",

They let you sit for as long as you want, drinking as much real champagne as you want, eating as much of the above-mentioned foods as you want. They have some other items also like sushi, some staple Italian dishes, ham and an impressive dessert spread. Try a freshly made crepe!  The service is great - a couple of waiters saw to our every comfort for the three hours we were there. For the price, if you spend some time there, its worth every penny.",

I enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice, unlimited complimentary champagne and fresh cappucino.  There is a variety of yummy deserts but my favorite were the big chocolate dipped strawberries!  Classic!  This buffet is tucked away in Bally's.  If you haven't tried before, you should.  Yumm!  We were there at 10:30am on Sunday and there was no wait but we made reservations in advance.  When you make reservations, they ask for your credit card info but won't charge you until the day you have brunch.",

    "text": "Oh. My. God. Each time we visit Vegas the Sterling Brunch is the first reservation we make. Late enough in the morning so that we can sleep off the fine dining and frolicking from the night before, and not so late that the nap we'll need afterward cramps our style.   When you go, because you will, dress appropriately to impress at mid-day. The brunch takes place in Bally's Steakhouse and covets the upscale vibe. The lighting is low in a comforting way, they understand where you were last night, and why you are wearing your shades. And the booths are big and roomy.   Come thirsty - the refills on all beverages are fast and generous. We always joke about bringing sharpies and just writing our names on the bottles of Perrier Jouet champagne that we'll empty - and then share an uncomfortable pause because we weren't really joking.   Come hungry, because when that brief moment of silence is broken you'll be on your next trip to the buffet, and here is where I should admit that I do not generally like buffets, so let's call this a \"display\" of all things quest worthy for foodies: fresh, beautiful berries that taste like summer even in February. Surf that impresses this seafood lovin' north-westerner, turf that makes my mid-western roots tingle with glee, and eggs every way you like 'em! And there's more: pastries, chocolates, sauces, dips, rolls...  You, like me, may just feel the need to have some more champagne and think this through while delicately nibbling on some caviar and toast points.",

    "text": "We wish we could say that we're hip cats and always have our finger on the pulse of the Vegas dining scene.  We could say that to all of you in Yelp-land, but we'd be lying.  We heard about the Sterling Brunch from that cheezy Food Network show.  You know, the one where that dopey guy and that irritating woman who looks like a soccer mom on crystal meth travel around the US eating their way into insanity.  We saw the show and became brainwashed like the rest of America.  We're ashamed, and we admit it.  Fortunately for us though, Sterling Brunch turned out to be a sweet find.  Soccer mom and dopey dude really found a gem here which is not an easy thing to do in Vegas, the land of endless buffets, fine food, and excess.  What makes this buffet so different?  My friend, if you have to ask then you are not worthy.  We'll let others on this forum describe the food and just say that the quality is top-notch.  The setting is in a space usually occupied by the steakhouse at Bally's.  Dark hardwood surrounds you and waiters in tuxedos tend to you with offerings of mimosas (using good quality champagne) and cloth napkins.  The best part of this brunch is that the irritating hillbilly tourist families are usually turned away by the price ($65 per person).  That's right folks!  You won't have some bratty snot covered 2 year old running up and down the aisles chasing her flea-infested brother.  Nope, the people here are actually somewhat presentable.  Make sure to secure reservations in advance as walk-ins were turned away when we went.  Also, the Sterling Brunch only happens on Sundays, so you'll be mightily disappointed if you show up at their door on say a Tuesday morning looking for fine grub.  Bring an extra stomach and make the wifey take her largest purse so you can steal extra food for the flight home.",

The champagne was amazing, we must have had at least 5 flutes each and I tried a mimosa which was equally as amazing.  They have lobsters that are halved and decently sized (and they aren't the flat lobster either). Usual with prime rib, lamb (was very good though), and I forget what other meats. The oysters and caviar are probably what I stacked up on the most. The oysters were delicious! I also liked the crab claws, all meat without the work.  Don't get me started on desserts... who's not a dessert fan? They were beautiful and delicious. It was cute how some were in champagne glasses, also very convenient to take back to your hotel room :) For the price it's a splurge, but I plan to go again when I hit up Vegas.",

The moment we came to check in, the host brought out Perrier Jouet champagne while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  The service is impeccable.  You don't even notice them picking up your plates when they're complete.  You won't be able to keep count how many glasses of champagne because they keep toppen it off.  Maybe even look into booking a room or have a DD ready if you plan to drink properly.  Onto the food - defniitely stay away from the greens and the carb's until you've loaded up on seafood and meats.   I enjoyed the belgiam waffles with fresh rasberry sauce but that wasn't until plate 5 or 6.....  For the seafood and meats -- I wish they could serve more rare choices of meats but it was still delish.  The lobster was cooked well but thought it could use a little seasoning.  Still - lobster tails AYCE is INSANITY.  There is a plethora of raw oysters, shrimp cocktail, king crab legs,  snow crab claws, sushi/sashimi, and CAVIAR.  we were there from 11am to 4pm, the last table....muhahahahahahaah  They also had a locals $20 off promotion so came out to $65 per person before tax and gratutity.  Be sure to make sure this discount is going on if you hit it up.",

    "text": "What a screwing this trip was!  I wanted to take my wife to a first class brunch, so we (I) decided that even at $85., it would be worth it to go to the Sterling Brunch.  Boy was I wrong!!  It started with our arrival at 11:20 AM for our 11:30 reservation (I had made reservations in October, 2012).  There was a big long line.  I went to the hostess, and was told get in line.....it doesn't matter if you have reservations.  I wanted to leave, but couldn't recall if I'd guaranteed my reservation with a credit card, so I stayed in line.  At noon, we were taken to our seats, and waited on, but not well.  We got our champagne from Eduardo who kept us in champagne all day, but no one directed us to the buffet, or anywhere else for that matter.  Once at the buffet, the food was generally just OK.  The cold shrimp were good, but the broiled lobster tail was as chewy as a rubber ball.....a charred rubber ball.  And just a bit tastier.  The deserts were awesome, but not awesome enough to save this trip to brunch at Bally's.  We're never going back to Sterling.  It was a $49.99 experience at best.  p.s. I'd never heard of a Groupon until yesterday, and I still didn't know what a Groupon is really, but apparently everyone had one in the big long line.......except us.  We got treated like a Grouponer, except with the check......that was full strength.  I don't care to play the coupon game, in part because of silly BS lines, rules, exceptions, etc.    p.p.s.  Had to self park.  Valet full.  BS for an expensive trip to what is supposed to be a classy brunch.",

We have hit the other popular buffets over the years:  Caesars; M; Green Valley; Main Street; Wynn, Paris; Spice Market...to name a few..and no one compares.  They have made-to-order eggs benedict as well- lobster or steak benedicts.  My husband got a lobster omelet...which was very good.  The lobster tails were big and good.  Caviar was very good.  We used the popovers they gave us to eat with the caviar.  We focused on the seafood (can you tell???) but they also had prime rib; rack of lamb; slab of bacon; and ham.  They had filet mignon.  Desserts were good, different from what you normally see at a buffet.  Oh and the champagne- they keep it flowing and your glasses filled always.  We are definitely going back again.",

    "text": "4.5 stars.  Was in LV during CES weekend.  Thought this place would be packed so made a reservation for 9:30AM.  Surprisingly, the place never got full.  Would say 1/4 of the tables were still empty when we left around noon.  Took our time stuffing our faces and washing things down w/ champagne!  A credit card was required when I made my reservation.  Was informed that a penalty would be charged to the card if cancellations were not made before 3:00PM on Sat or if no show.  Didn't ask how much the penalty would be.  Thought this was kinda weird as I've never experienced this w/ any other restaurants.  I mean... it's not like they'd refuse walk-ins..... Anyways, took it as the hotel reception's problem, (money hungry cuz the recession!?), nothing to do with the restaurant.  The PRO's: -SERVICE!  Waiter made me an emperor!!  Never had to ask for refills on water, oj, nor champagne.  Our waiter would pull out our chairs for us every time we made it back to our table, w/ dirty plates gone of course. -LAMB CHOPS!  My fav red meat in this meal.  Medium - med. rare.  Mint jellies on the side. Perfecto~ -KING CRAB LEGS!  I'd take steaming hot legs over cold ones anytime!  No fuss with the butter cooling/clumping up halfway.  Props to our waiter for actually cracking each and every leg, wrapped in towel, with the handle of the table knife! -LOBSTER TAILS!  Like others said, only grab it when its fresh!  Overcooked rubbery chewiness is a no no! -CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRIES!  HUGE!  I mean MONSTROUS strawberries + chocolate.  Nuff said!?  The SOSO's: -CAVIER.  Only have sevruga cavier.  The small black roes.  Cheaper and most abundant type out there.  Although they were fresh. -FRUITS.  Think they could have up-ed a notch here.  There's definitely more variety than other buffets, but quality just wasn't there.  Sliced dragon fruits, tasteless papaya, and canned lychee in addition to the usual buffet bunch didn't quite make these fruits \"exotic\" either; which is what the waiter proclaimed them to be.  Having figs were a plus imo though.  The CON's: -PRIME RIB.  No \"lips\" on any of the 3 roasts that they had!  That's like having fried chicken w/o skin!! Other reviewers' pix had some better ones.  Bad batch of roasts i guess.  Choice grade at best. -NO CRACKERS.  I like to enjoy my cheese w/ crackers.  Not used to eating brie straight up.  Our waiter did grab some crackers from next door.  Nabisco crackers... Thanks but no thanks.  Overall, the service and champagne masked all the disliking I had towards this place.  Would come back only to share the experience with people who hasn't been here.  Otherwise, rather drop my $85/pop at a non-buffet restaurant.",

    "text": "Too much hype, not enough substance.  This place aims high but misses.   The not so sterling brunch buffet does provide a variety of offerings not common to run-of-the-mill buffets. This Sunday morning, the hot selection, among other things, included lobster tails, duck breasts and lamb chops. The cold selection was highlighted by plated salmon lox as well as domestic caviar and its accouterments. The above were sandwiched between champagne service at the table and bite-sized sweets and fruit selections for desert.  Shamefully most of the hot protein was well overcooked or had been sitting on the line for too long. The lobster tail was rubbery, the duck was inedible and the lamb... well just not good.  At the table while our hard working server tried to keep pace, she fell well short. Two rounds of dishes were not bused, coffee could not be ordered alongside desert and the final bill had to be sought from the passing manager.   We had high hopes for this visit based on previous reports but I guess there is only so much quality that can be delivered on a buffet line. There is no excuse however for poor service. At more than $80 per parson (not including gratuity) excellent service is the least that must be provided. If this brunch returns post-construction, hopefully it will be better staffed and managed.",

A pity ,because I really liked the food and the service was superb but I don't think it was worth the stomach ache,discomfort and diarrhea I suffered for hours after that.",

The brunch is stagged in a steakhouse and seating was overflowed to the Italian restaurant next door due to its popularity.  Personally I think Bally's ought to host the brunch in the theatre (as was like Caesars in the past) so customers don't have to pick up the food from the steakhouse and walk around with a plate full of food from the steakhouse and into the Italian restaurant.  Fortunately we were seated inside the steakhouse and avoided the hassle and embrassement from other patrons waiting at the lobby drooling over our plates of food.  Service was indeed excellent.  The server was not at all stingy in topping out our glass with champagne and promptly removing any empty plates.  Lots of upscale cold and hot food selection (including stone crab claws, raw oysters, smoke salmon, lobsters, caviar, sushi, etc...) However, they do \"hide\" the caviar behind the sushi counter so you have to ask the server for it as with the sushi.    I tried to taste a little bit of everything but still I was too stuffed at the end to try out all the desserts!  It's pricey but I'd still recommend it.  4 stars for the service and food, no star for the small dining room.",

We got there and waited maybe 5 minutes to get in (we were served Perrier Jouet Champagne while we waited, as well as unlimited while you eat).  The broiled lobster tails were good, and BIG.  But I wish they were boiled or steamed as they are much better that way.  The caviar was .. well, it's caviar.  The crab claws were big and full.  The tables are set up very nicely, everything is really nice and a bit on the fancy side.  The deserts were the best in Vegas.  You MUST try the chocolate covered strawberries.

    "text": "This was the start of the self-proclaimed \"Food Tour\" that the girlfriend and I decided to go on during a last-minute Vegas Trip. With no rhyme or reason for this \"Food Tour\" we had a list of restaurants that we wanted to explore and the Sterling Brunch was probably on the list the longest. Anyways, on to the review...  I am not usually a fan of buffets in any regard, but in this case this is THE BEST BRUNCH BUFFET IN VEGAS and THE BEST BUFFET I HAVE EVER HAD IN LIFE.  We were greeted with Perrier Jouet Champagne. So delicious and refreshing that I did not ruin it with orange juice. After getting seated, I immediately went straight for the Caviar. I think it was an American Sturgeon Caviar that was being served, if I saw the label correctly, and it was delicious with all the fix-ins (Warm Blinis, toasted french bread, onions, and cilantro).   The only reason why I gave this brunch 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because some of the dishes, especially the Filet Mignon and the Lobster, were a bit overcooked. Why offer beautiful ingredients and ruin them by overcooking them? But don't let that steer you away because regardless of being a tad overcooked it was still amazingly delicious and my champagne glass was never less than 1/2 a glass full. That kept me a happy camper. Also, a little complaint to our waiter that the Filet was a tad overcooked, 15 mins later he comes out with medium rare Filets that were delicious, we tipped him graciously. The lamb was also delicious but you have to make sure to let the carver now that you want it rare or you may end up with another piece of overcooked meat. They also had oysters and an omelet making station. The omelet I skipped but the oysters were to die for.    There was also a sushi section that was highly disappointing. I asked the Sushi Chef for some albacore, she had none, I asked her for some salmon, she had none. I'm not sure if it was just out of laziness on her part or if they were just plain out. But its ok... I moved on to the next section because I honestly didn't go to this brunch for sushi anyways. Like I said unlimited Lobster tails and Filet Mignon was the main reason I came and regardless of it being overcooked it was like heaven knowing you could eat as many lobster tails as you wanted. The desserts were also amazing. We almost had to pass on the desserts because we were so full. But we forced ourselves out of our Cardiac Chairs and stuffed ourselves with some freshly made crepes, macaroons, cakes, and other assorted pastries. The desserts were all amazing and a good way to end the meal.  We then stumbled out of the brunch buffet drunk and stuffed. And then, smiled to each other and said.... \"THAT WAS BOMB!\"",

    "text": "In the days of buffets the size of a small basketball arena that endeavor to impress with excess, I stumbled upon the smallest buffet in Las Vegas with the best buffet food and drink in the whole city. The Sterling Brunch at Bally's is not a step up from the others. It is an elevator to the penthouse up from the others. When you begin your experience with a never empty glass of Perrier-Jouet champagne, things are going well. The room is dark, comfortable, inviting. The servers are top notch and attend to your every need instantaneously. There is no hustle to reach the buffet. The buffet room, though small by comparison, has everything you need and food is constantly refreshed. And people are polite. There are no more than one or two people in front of you at any one time so you are literally seconds from selecting your food. Personally, I found everything to be wonderfully prepared and flavorful. My plate(s) included, shrimp, lobster tails, crab legs, rack of lamb, fillet mignon, caviar, blini and all the trimmings. There's a carving station that, among other wonderful things included a whole side of Nueske bacon that is hand sliced to your desires. Don't see that ever! Gotta tell you that I went back numerous times and I was smiling all the way. Yup it's pricey. But worth every penny. Make a reservation. Seriously, make a reservation. At the Sterling Brunch you get your money's worth and then some. And then some more.",

To be fair, this place would've gotten a 5 if it hadn't been for that!  We had reservations for 10:30am, but were a little early.  They asked for a players card and we don't have one.  They seated us in the main restaurant (it wasn't very full at that time) and our waiter came over.  Our waiter was very friendly and super helpful.  He was quick with the service and the removal of plates (there were a lot!).    The food was not as varied as I'm used to at a buffet, which I think I actually liked.  It meant that the stuff they did, they did well.  The omelets were wonderful, and not too big.  The filet mignon was superb and the fruit was super fresh.  I wasn't as big a fan of the lobster, I like the tails and not much of the rest.  The crab, however, was YUMMY!!!!  I also was a big fan of the mini belgian waffles.    All in all, it was a fabulous brunch.  We left so stuffed that we didn't eat again until about 4 or 5pm.  I would definitely recommend going earlier as it had begun to pick up and they were seating non-members in the other restaurant.",

I guess they aren't used to 3 year olds dining there (she is a perfect guest and they ended up not charging for her). They quickly converted the table to a round 5 top and added a chair for our daughter.   Service was attentive and plentiful. It was never overbearing, but always available when we needed something and they were quick to refill champagne glasses.  The buffet was perfectly proportioned with cold items, salads, soup, fruit, and the hot items. Every dish felt perfectly picked and aligned to create a wonderful menu. The boiled shrimp and raw oysters were accompanied by ingredients to mix your own cocktail sauce. The caviar is served as a plentiful portion with blinis, garnishes, and creme fraiche. My fiance had commented earlier that was all prime ribbed out, but said that his slice was the best he had had in Vegas. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection and very tasty. Pan fried soft shell crab was unexpected, but welcome. The lobster was actually the first well-cooked lobster I have had. It actually made me like lobster. We had a lobster and boursin omelet made to order which was heavenly. The mini deserts, plus the crepe and bananas foster station were the perfect topper to the meal.    Make reservations well in advance.  I think we'll be talking about this perfect meal for years to come.",

I seriously think I get my money's worth here with the unlimited boojey champagne, caviar, and lobster tails. The only reason I knocked off a star was because the lobster was a bit inconsistent.  Every other time I've been here, the lobster was cooked to perfection.  However, the first batch of lobster tails I ate this trip was really soft and mushy.  The next batch, however, was much better less overcooked.  Highly recommended, but only if you're not hungover from Sat. night activities because it's definitely not cheap!",

There is lobster tail, lamb chops, veal, sea bass, escargo, caviar, oysters, rock shrimp, soufflees. But in the end the only thing worth dining here is for their lamb chops and sea bass. Everything else I would avoid. You get better quality lobster tail from Red Lobster. The rock shrimp is good though. The omlettes they make are fantastic with lumps of lobster you can have added, but at 85 a person id rather go to a nice restaurant and dine than gorge myself on what is 3 star quality food at best. For a buffet its five stars but not for the $.",

I now compare it to a high school cafeteria with plain bland dining room and food that's dry and tasteless.  They took away the  wonderful salads and salmon and meat and cheese platters.  Sushi now comes 2 pieces on a plate of their choice.  Salmon comes 1 piece on a plate.   Lobster tasteless,  crab legs cold and not good. Filet in a small personal skillet that was chewy and way overdone.  Lamb chops that were my favorite are now dry and tasteless.   I don't know how these others are giving higher reviews  unless they have never been here before and don't realize how bad it is now. Must say they at least kept the champagne. One redeeming factor!  I guess the biggest problem was the cafeteria setting.  Instead of the lovely food stations that were maintained beautifully it is now stand in a long line with your plate and pick up dishes already made up.  No ambiance at all.  The desserts were displayed on top of the bar and not labeled so you had no clue as to what it was or what was in it.  For the high price tag on the buffet the food should be a lot lot better.  This wasn't even mediocre.  We left in less than a hour which was never the case before.",

While Vegas buffets tend to be carbon copies of each other, Sterling offers an abundance of dishes you'll find nowhere else in town. Ostrich tenderloin, Maine lobster, braised rabbit with buttered linguine, stone crab, striped sea bass and capers, freshly-prepared sushi, caviar and foie gras, peppercorn-encrusted rack of lamb, Sturgeon caviar, and lobster mingle with more traditional - and, in comparison, very mundane - breakfast fare like omelets and waffles on tables laden with enough food to feed a small Third World nation. Footmen in formal dress keep Perrier Jouet champagne flowing, and the desserts rival those to be found in the finest Parisian patisseries. Damn the expense . . . with any luck, you can always win it back - and then some - at the tables later on. Reservations are essential.",

I must have had an entire bottle of Perrier Jouet Champagne Brut which costs $32 at BevMo. That coupled with the lobster, cheese, and Cognac omelets could make the meal worth $60, but not $85.   We had a party of 6, but we did not all arrive at the same time. They ended up seating 2 people right next to the brunch line and the rest of us in another room about a city block from the food. Making reservations is a MUST for this place. You MUST request to be sat near the brunch line. Otherwise, you'll be walking off all that Brut and Lobster you've just stuffed your face with. We ended up getting moved over to the prime location next to the food so it wasn't that much of a pain.  The mini Belgian waffles were very good. The fruit was very fresh. The caviar was well.... it was caviar.   The good thing about this place is that you don't have to eat another meal for a solid 8 hours.   The wait staff was very friendly. He was able to split the bill 5 different ways, which was nice.   One other thing about this brunch is that it's not an enormous amount of food that you find elsewhere. The restaurant itself is not that large so being in the brunch line itself, feels very cramped.   I say go for it if you have an extra $85 to spend and your significant other doesn't mind lobster farts. Just make sure to line your purse with ziplock bags so you can bring home extra crab legs to your family and friends. ;)",

My husband loved watching Sunday football while grubbing on lobster tails.   For $95 you definitely get your money's worth here. You gotta strategize and not get too full off buffet fluff. Lobster tails are FAT, king crab legs are MEATY, prime rib DELISH, shrimp cocktails were HUGE and the bloody Mary's and champagne was non-stop. I liked the popover bread too, crusty exterior and chewy buttery interior.   Cons: the crab leg crackers don't work well on Alaskan king crab. Wish they had the crab stick (pointy end) that other buffets have. I hate to peel the crab leg piece by piece it took forever because the spiny thorns and by the time you finished the crab meat got cold. Boo. Also skip the lobster bisque it wasn't very good.   Overall I think if you compare this to Bacchanal Buffet you will expect too much. Bacchanal has 3x more variety there BUT you have to wait in those hour+ lines and they don't have lobster. So you pick what suits your style!",

Even with a reservation it took us 30 mins to be seated, but you can get your champagne start while waiting.    Love the menu, it has every grand thing on it!  The caviar is only the black tiny one, sitting in bowls between sushi and berries.  The sushi is the weakest thing among all items, not professionally rolled and have very little choices.  The oysters are the second weak thing, simply not meaty enough.  All the cooked items are excellent, especially the rack of lamb and the prime ribs.  Even the steak or sea bass in the iron skillets are not overcooked, all tender and flavorful!    Interior is quite dark, but service is friendly. Waiters are busy, so do expect a little wait trying to flag them down.  They will automatically pour champagne and put down glasses of orange juice.",

At first glance it seemed like we entered heaven.   Then we went to the buffet. It was too short, and everything just seemed bland. The meat was cold, the lobsters rubbery and the sushi seemed old. I was heartbroken. For 100$ a person, you'd think you would get a plethora of fresh seafood and all the trimmings. Sadly, it's not. It's just a status symbol. The bottomless champagne was okay, but couldn't save it.   If you're in it for a taste of old Vegas, go for it. If you're looking to walk away with a full belly and a smile, don't waste your money.",

    "text": "Saying this up front, best buffet experience I've had in Vegas and I have had a lot.   This is a $105 brunch buffet at Bally's that requires a reservation well in advanced, but for good reason. Located at BLT steakhouse, this buffet is only available for Sunday brunch, so if you want to end your Vegas trip with a bang this is the way to go.   So what do you get for $105? You get a server who is very knowledgeable in food and Vegas in general, who will serve unlimited champagne that can be turned into mimosasa and a decent bloody mary bar where you can add a lot of different flavors and garnishes into your bloody mary. Also typical buffet trap, the popover bread was incredible!! The bread had a perfectly crispy outside and a fluffy delicious inside, perfect to put the black caviar they have at the sauce station. I normally would say avoid the bread at a buffet but omg ya'll need to try it.   Now for the actual buffet food. The choices was very limited compare to other places, but everything there was quality Some of the highlights there were the king crab legs, whole lobster tail, prime rib, and raw oysters. The crab legs were juicy, meaty and fresh, but the best thing was that they actually gave you crab crackers and crab forks so it made it so much easier than using a regular fork like at other buffets. My favorite there was the whole lobster tail the amount of meat and value you get is the best bang for your buck. I think I ate 4 of them and would eat more if it could fit. Problem is the meat gets sort of tough when it cools down so remember to get the fresh one. Last thing, I would try to avoid the filet mignon and the rack of lamb, it might have been just that day, but those cuts were a bit dry to my liking. However, I didn't mind because I feel like those meats are generally dry at other buffets.   In general, this is going to be a staple of my Vegas trip from now on. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "I love brunch. When planning my meals in Vegas, I was toying with the idea of Sterling Brunch. I know it's expensive for a brunch, but unlimited Perrier Jouet? I could drink at least a bottle, right? Well, the answer is yes I can! And more!  Bally's sterling brunch ($85) *Perrier jouet champagne   Chilled seafood: *Poached jumbo shrimp *Fanny bay oysters *Jonah crab claws  Cold offerings: *American amia caviar with bilinis *Assorted sushi *BLT caesar salad *BLT vegetable salad *Artisanal meats & cheeses *Fresh berries & sliced seasonal fruit *Yogurt & granola parfait *Toy box tomatoes, cheese & balsamic dressing *Scottish smoke salmon  Carving: *Slow cooked prime rib of beef *Crusted rack of lamb, chimichurri *Roasted slab bacon  From the kitchen: *Prosciutto eggs benedict *Steak eggs benedict *Lobster eggs benedict  Brunch buffet: *Omelets & farm fresh eggs cooked to order including their famous lobster, cognac & boursin cheese omelet *Maytag blue & piquillo pepper frittata *Belgian waffles *Bread pudding french toast, caramelized bananas *Lobster tail, cognac jus *Fingerling potatoes & chorizo *Fresh chive & cheddar biscuits, pancetta country gravy *Grilled asparagus *Truffle mashed potatoes *Cheese tortellini with bolognese sauce *Steamed Alaskan king crab legs *Lemon rosemary airline chicken breast *Grilled filet mignon *Nueske applewood smoked bacon *Roasted pork sausage *Salmon & ratatouille with fig balsamic glaze  *Lobster bisque *Desserts: display of french pastries and individual desserts  I don't know if the menu is out there anywhere, but this is basically what they offered. Sure, it's great having crab legs, claws and lobster tails, but they were all overcooked. And the truffle mashed potatoes were gluey, but had great truffle aroma and flavor. The caviar was good, but there's only so much caviar a person can eat. The rack of lamb may have been my favorite from the carving station. It was cooked a nice rare. The dessert display was gorgeous and I enjoyed the few things I ate from it.  So in the end, is it worth it? For me, yes. But I drank over a bottle of Perrier Jouet by myself, had a couple servings of caviar, their famous lobster omelette, all the shellfish they offered and almost tried everything at the buffet. For the roommate, probably not. He doesn't really drink that much nor did he eat a lot of caviar or shellfish. He'd rather have more variety since this buffet is on the smaller side.  I've read great things about how good this buffet used to be. I wish I had visited Sterling back then. Maybe not that much has changed, but unless you're big on champagne and caviar, the food itself isn't that much to rave about. I think you can get the same offerings at other buffets in Vegas.",

First off this is Old Style Vegas- I'm taking Dark Rooms, Prime Rib, solid champagne, and all you can eat lobster and seafood. What more can you ask for? They have caviar and some delicious dessert, but the focus needs to be on the champagne and Seafood. Make sure you get your moneys worth because they are going to tax your behind. You definitely need to book your reservation months in advance because they are only open 1 day a week. I can't wait to enjoy this wonderful brunch again.",

    "text": "Our experience at Sterling was disappointing. For the price tag, we were expecting varieties of fresh seafood and meat dish but all they offered was several savory options, plus made-to-order egg dishes and limited selection of desserts. Literally it will take you only 5 seconds walking from the first dish to the last dish they display on the counter.   Don't get me wrong, they do serve fancy dishes, such as lobsters, crab claws, prime rib but the quality does not match the price tag. The lobsters that we had during first two rounds were not fully cooked, we told our server when he picked up our dishes (he could also see that the lobster meat was transparent - not cooked). He apologized and brought us couple lobster pieces, without us asking (Very kind of him, I wish I remember his name!) but this time, the lobster was overcooked and rubbery.   We also tried the raw oyster on half shelves, they didn't do a good job opening them, small pieces of shell were all over the oysters. Plus, they were prepared at an earlier time so the oysters were dry as they had been sitting in the fridge for awhile. I knew because I saw the guy behind the counter took them out from the fridge to refill the plate. What a disappointment.    Crab claws were good but they were impossible to fail!  We did enjoy the champagne, we have always been a PJ fans. That's the only good part of our dining experience.   Oh, almost forgot to mention. A staff walked around the restaurant to give out red roses to female customers at the end of the buffet hour, out of the few roses she had left in her hand, she chose to give me one that's already dead. My husband and I had a good laugh out of it. We left it on the table, next to the strawberries that had the matching look (that were freezer-burned).  Maybe we were there on their off day but honestly, we will not return. There are plenty of choices in Vegas. I hope you will have a better experience than us.",

    "text": "Highly anticipated brunch buffet for me after watching all of the mouthwatering reviews on YouTube. I even put it on my bucket list. Reserved a couple of seats 2 months out & asked my wife to book a flight & room for that weekend. Even my buddies were waiting on the edge of their seats for me to tell 'em just how good it really was. So I arrived St. Patty's day, 30 minutes earlier than our reservations. The hosts are courteous & do advise us that we probably won't be seated until our reserved time. She offers us a place to sit with champagne, we wait 30 minutes, then promptly get escorted to our seats around 11:30. They pour us more Pierre Jouet champagne and bring us the pop lovers. So far, so good, really happy. Of course I load up on the stars of the show: lobster tails & king crab. Man...this is where my heart sank. The lobsters were bland and either dry or the meat had a powdery texture. I think I tried 5 lobsters, and just 1 was cooked okay with a crunchy, juicy interior. And the king crab....omg, talk about some miniature crab legs. They were no bigger than the width of my thumb. I guess I'm spoiled because of an indian casino's seafood buffet in northern ca that serves real king crab legs 2 inches in diameter for $35! So yes, to see those tiny legs when I'm paying $110 was a huge disappointment! I guess the hundreds of folks giving this place 5 stars haven't experienced True king-sized crab legs. On a positive note the champagne bottles were constantly popping and flowing at Sterlings if that's your thing. I also did order 2 customized bloody marys at the bar but they were just ok. My filet mignon was a perfect medium. My wife's was more on the well done side so some inconsistency there. The rack of lamb was good, juicy & well seasoned. The lobster omelet with boursin cheese was also very good. Compliments to Webster, the omelet chef, polite, friendly, funny and professional! And the pop over starters were also good! The desserts were a disappointment, nothing that stands out but that is expected because this buffet is very small and the very limited selection is reflected in the dessert section. Overall, for $110, I wouldn't come back. There are too many good buffets for half the price with equal or better food quality and selection minus the alcohol. On a side note, the couple sitting next to us who were visiting from New Orleans echoed our disappointment with the buffet considering the hefty $110 price tag. So...if drinking endless Pierre Jouet champagne, eating lobster omelets and rack of lambs is your thing, then give Sterling's brunch buffet a try.",

The review is for the service and hopefully someone from management would read this and see what happened today.  The bread and the lamb were amazing.  The issue is the steak, it was served so luke warm that the butter didn't even melt.  The lobster was probably the worst.  It was so bad that when I stuck my fork in it,  the lobster broke up into pieces like it was powder.  Now think about it, overcooked lobster should be super rubbery not soft and broken up.   This was not overcooked.  The lobster had probably gone bad before  they cooked it which is severely bad food handling for it to crumble like powder when I tried to eat it.  Management you should look into this.  I was there today 11/27 with a reservation at 9:30 and it was a pretty shifty experience when I paid $250 ($50 tip since it isn't the fault of my waiters). Yeah people say \"unlimited champagne\" but if you are there to enjoy the food then the food should taste amazing not just get the guests drink as hell off drinks.",

We went in and sat down, greeted by champagne and \"fresh squeezed orange juice.\" The server described it as such but I later saw him pouring from a carton that said, \"fresh squeezed orange juice\" into the serving pitchers.  The food is actually pretty limited and there aren't as many choices as wicked spoon or other Vegas buffets. The area itself is pretty small because it's not built for a buffet. There were oysters, snow crabs, a sushi station, a carving table (prime rib and lamb), two buffet self serve stations, and a small dessert bar.   The seafood was solid and fresh. The prime rib was also good but nothing extraordinary. So why pay $90 for this buffet? Lobster and caviar. The lobster tails are thick and juicy, so if you're a fan you'll get your money's worth.  The caviar was also good but the most of the guys weren't fans. I recommend trying this at least once but if you want a wide variety then other Vegas buffets would be a better choice. If you really want seafood this place is perfect.",

However, I must caution you to not plan anything for the rest of the day or the next day for that matter.  We partook yesterday and this morning I awoke feeling like a total zombie from the free flowing Perrier Jouet, lobster, crab, lamb, steak, caviar.  They have every decadent piece of food within imagination and then some.    Feast like royalty.  Stay as long as you like.  Our party of 6 was too full to continue eating, but we sat and had a great time drinking champagne and chatting for hours.  The service is truly wonderful;  your glass never reaches half full and you rarely notice the service even though they are paying close attention to your every need.     Truly the brunch of a lifetime.  In a city known for stiff competition for Sunday brunch there isn't a single one that even comes close to Sterling Brunch.   There are plenty of great brunches out there, but most of them cut their expenses on the champagne.  Not this one, generously poured Perrier Jouet!",

Well spent money, and the buzz from the champagne was good:)225 with tip for 2....",

The buffet items included Lobster Tail, Prime Rib, Sushi and Shrimp. Warren, the Manager was welcoming, friendly and hospitable! Thank you for providing excellent customer service. When you come to visit Las Vegas, i would highly recommend this upscale experience! And...don't forget to drink the Champagne :)",

    "text": "My best friend and I bought a groupon for this brunch, and were so excited to try it out! Based on all the reviews, we came up with our game plan - drink lots of champagne, eat lots of lobster, and starve ourselves the night before so we could eat as much as we could.  So we arrived 10 minutes before our RESERVATION. Meaning, we called weeks in ADVANCE to secure our table, and even though we arrived early, we still thought a RESERVATION would let us be seated in a timely manner. When we arrived, the hostess told us we would have to WAIT AN HOUR. Are you kidding me?? I asked her what the point was in making a reservation, and all she told me was that if I didn't have one, we wouldn't be eating (and was SO RUDE while saying that). They offered us bloody mary's while we waited, so I guess that was a nice touch, but still AN HOUR WAIT?? Clearly we were going to start off our meal annoyed.   While waiting an hour, we quickly realized that everyone with a groupon was being seated in one section (we dubbed it the cafeteria because that's what it looked like) and patrons paying full price we being seated in the actual nicer restaurant portion.  ALSO, when we arrived, the restaurant portion was EMPTY. So they were saving it for other people, while people who had paid in advance with our groupon had to wait an hour?? I know we have a groupon, but it's not my fault I got a deal... it's Bally's who offered it, so if they were going to treat us like second class, they shouldn't have offered it at all.   So onto the food - it was delicious. The caviar was just what we wanted, we ate our weight in lobster, and the severs never let our champagne glasses get empty.  This is the ONLY reason they are getting two stars. The rest of the food was fine. It wasn't outstanding, the quality wasn't top notch, it didn't have an amazing selection (quite small comparatively). I would NEVER EVER come back here and pay full price. The food was worth the groupon price, but I'd rather go to Wynn or Bellagio brunch buffet, pay the same price as my groupon and have amazing service then come back here.  Personally, I also wouldn't recommend this to anyone either. Go to a classy hotel, and you'll get a classy brunch. Lesson Learned.",

    "text": "Pre-game: Purchased 2 groupons at 2 for $98.  Walked for an hour with our friends at Seven Hills on the trails to prepare.  Eric R. ran.  Game time: Arrived at Ballys for 11:30 AM reservations.  Waited at standing-only cocktail table to be seated, almost took til 12 PM.  We sat down at our table (set for 2, we had 4 in the party) in the \"VIP\" section and were ignored for 20+ minutes.  Tons of staff walked by but the servers kept telling us our waiter was in the back and would be out very shortly.  In that time, a server brought the table settings for the other 2 people.  The other servers saw our frustration (or my impatience rather) and finally filled up our water and champagne glasses, and offered orange juice - the table ordered 3 juices and a busser brought them out.  Bloody Marys are also included (Eric had one).  We sat so we could give our server the groupons, but he never came so finally the other server who gave us drinks told us to go eat.  I went to the cold section first.  The buffet is rather small compared to other buffets on the strip though it costs retail 3-4 times more.  We had just been to the M and thought $40 was high and their selection is quite large.  Here, there is a teeny sushi counter and you have to ask for each piece, which is uncomfortable.  I got 2 spicy tuna roll pieces and 2 pieces of tako nigiri.  Then I asked for caviar (it is not offered verbally to you there), got my blini and condiments, and moved on.  I got smoked salmon and some oysters (pretty large) and some goat cheese and toasts.  That was my first round.  When I got to the table, the server who brought table settings admitted he was our server and apologized for the wait, claiming he brought the orange juice that the busser brought before he showed up...hmmm.  Eric asked for a bread basket and off he went.  The food was good - they had pretzel rolls in the basket.  I mostly had goat cheese+smoked salmon+caviar+condiments with the bread and blini and toasts to start.  The oysters I had were really good with a squeeze of lemon.  Then I went for hot food - my friends had seen duck but when I went there they were out - the chef said they had to go find duck at the Paris and bring it back?  I got the very last lamb chop at the cutting board (keep in mind they are open til 3?) then got a beef sope to share with Eric (sope tough, beef delicious and spicy).  The lamb chop I got was sooo delicious and actually cooked (I had a raw one at Caesars Bacchanal - see pic I posted on that page)!  The breakfasty stuff did not appeal to me so I went back for more of the caviar, smoked salmon, and sushi.  Then, for dessert I had a bananas foster crepe (yummy) and the whipped cream was vanilla scented and tasty.  I then got up to go to the bathroom outside of the restaurant.  When I came back, my friends acquired me some duck that magically appeared (very tasty) and Eric R. said he saw the sushi chef with a plate of sashimi hidden behind the counter that she was only sharing with certain guests.  He had to ask for it since it was not on display - this is a bit sketchy to me.  He ended up with 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail which was cut very generously, and he shared a little with me.  I wish they had offered that all along!  The whole set up of the sushi/caviar area seemed restricted and made me feel a bit awkward asking for each thing, but it was really 1/4th of the savory items available.  In the end, this was definitely a once in a lifetime experience - definitely pricey for the small buffet even with the groupon - I suppose people feel it is worth it to pay for the Perrier-Jouet champagne.  It was neat to come here (and see Eric happy with lobster tails and my friends happy with king crab legs and snow crab claws, etc.) but the options are limited.  The service also was a bit frustrating since it seemed everyone got waited on but us at the beginning, and from reservations to being seated to getting some service took probably around 45 minutes.  We did tip on the retail amount.  Women get a long stemmed rose on the way out of the restaurant, and men get a handshake.  No one rushed us from the table to finish though, so that was good.    Post-game: Walked the strip for over 4 hours after the meal, showing our friends 7 more properties since one had never been to Vegas.",

They have a smaller number of stations that most buffets, however the quality and content of what's served is really great.  They have 8oz lobster tails, snow crab legs, caviar, gourmet desserts, champagne, and other breakfast/brunch items.  Let's face it, you go for the prime rib, lobster, crab, and caviar.  If you like those four items, it's worth it to pay $90+.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed.  I really enjoyed it, and would definitely return.",

For example, my first lobster tail was a near perfectly delicious.  The second was a bit mushy (i.e. not very fresh).  Also, the stone crab claws I had were watery and tasteless.  Tip, if you go, try to get an earlier reservation.  The brunch ends at 2:30.  We saw people with 1pm reservations who were still waiting at 1:30 because customers are slow to give up their tables.  Also, sign up for a Total Rewards card at any of the associated hotels for a discount.    Lastly, I was surprised at how limited the selection was.  My expectations were way off in that I thought it was a place that offered many variations of lobster.  Definitely, that was not the case.  Just one type of lobster tail, eggs benedict (made to order!) and ravioli.  The latter contained almost no lobster.  Keep in mind, the restaurant is not a full time buffet.  Instead, it's a steakhouse that sets up a small buffet on Sundays.",

To start off you have to make reservations in advance and they only open Sunday for brunch. Be warned: it's $85 per person. That's right, that wasn't a typo. However, with that hefty price tag comes some very extravagant perks as you'll see. When you first arrive if you're table is not yet ready, enjoy some complimentary champagne/bloody mary's while you wait. When you do get seated you're transported back to old school Vegas. The walls are lined with old photos of Elvis, Rat Pack, etc.  The waiters are fully suited up and look like they can be your butler for the next couple of hours. Great, nostalgic ambiance for some.   As for the food and drink, prepare to be astonished. The meal comes with unlimited champagne and I put this to the test with round after round of mimosas. The food well, is just super over the top in excess of anything you might expect. Lobster tails, crab legs, caviar, fresh oysters, oysters rockafeller, prime rib, rack of lamb, chilean sea bass, sashimi, dragonfruit, crepe station (I had bananas foster), oh and did I mention CAVIAR, probably but it's worth mentioning twice.   I'm not sure how often I'd come back but I'm really glad I got to experience it at least once before I died. I died. Nomnom.",

I only had a sip of sparkling wine because alcohol slows down digestions.  Some tips:  1. Make a reservation.  2. Arrive early for your reservation 3. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Unbelievable! Everything was cooked to perfection. I have been to other buffets that include lobster, crab legs, lamb, prime rib, etc. and half of the time the seafood or meat is overcooked. Not at Sterling Brunch. I was impressed with how well everything was prepared. Aside from the main attractions, a couple of items on the buffet that stood out were the blue cheese mashed potatoes and the lobster bisque.  Service was unbelievably good as well. Our champagne glasses were never empty, and I'll admit that I was guzzling that Perrier-Jouet so it was impressive that they could keep up. Our server, Tony, was a class act. He added a lot to our dining experience with the short conversations we had each time he stopped by throughout the meal.  $85 per person sounds pricy, and it is. But what really made this price worth it for us was the fact that we didn't experience the normal hustle-and-bustle of other Las Vegas buffets. Many times you will stand in line for 30 minutes or an hour, then there are crowds of people at the buffet (and sometimes children...hate that), and the whole experience is somewhat hectic and rushed. At the Sterling Brunch we made a reservation, walked right in, and enjoyed a rather quiet, leisurely meal that lasted over 2 hours. I'm so happy we decided to go. It was an unforgettable experience.",

Food temperature was tepid.  The service is better than the food.  I would say that the most that I would be willing to pay should  be $50 per person instead of the $95 plus tax.  If you do not have reservations, you can eat at the bar, or wait for a table. Sterling Brunch is way overrated.  Should be called instead the Copper or Nickel Brunch.",

So this time we made sure to fit Sterling Brunch into our schedule. I'm not a huge drinker so the champagne was nice but not a necessity for me. The fresh OJ was good and I drank a few mimosas. Our waiter was always around to refill our glasses and clear finished plates. As for the food, plenty of seafood and meat options! I was so looking forward to the lobster tails, and while they were plentiful, they were kind of overcooked and dry. The filet I had was about medium but others said theirs were more well done. The sushi didn't look great when we were there and the selection was pretty boring. I really liked the lobster ravioli and had a few of the other little side dishes. The popovers were great but I was so full I couldn't eat more than a few bites. I'd say this was a cool experience and a decent brunch but I think it's more of a one time thing for me.",

I specifically left $0 tip on the bill to make a statement and they have the nerve to charge me a tip?!?! I will definitely make sure everyone knows my disgust with this place.  I was looking forward to this place. Vegas local and have been to just about every high end buffet there is and this was on my to do list and boy was I disappointed  Service Was just horrible, our waiter spent a lot of time talking to two girls the entire time we were there. They got great service, our party, not so much. It was very frustrating to have to ask for things multiple times as was the case, I really expected much more from this place.  Food The selection is small. I do prefer quality over quantity but this place disappointed on both counts. The rack of lamb was excellent and the mint jelly was probably the best I ever had but the rest just sucked. The lobster tails were soggy as were the crab legs. The French toast bread putting just sucked and the shrimp were awful. Overall was not good.  Value I don't mind paying good money for a good meal but this was just horrific, Caesars, Bellagio, and Wynn Brunch are so much better and cheaper.  People seem to like this place, maybe I just got a bad server combined with a bad sampling of food but definitely not going to give it a second tru to find out.",

Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we didnt have empty glasses. He was very friendly and welcoming. I liked the lamb chops, and roasts.  The let downs: - no sign of caviar, looked carefully could not find it. Did they take it off the menu? - Would have liked the prawns, and lobster to be warmer. I did have the 1.30 booking, maybe that might have something to do with it but prawns were literally cold. Lobster barely warm more on the cold side. -oysters were very small and not as fresh. - beef in the pan was not warm either - nobody explained to us as first timers the dessert was in the front bar. Only realised later. Maybe it is obvious but we didnt know. Prob deserved more like a 3.8 or 3.9 but couldnt give that.",

Endless lobster tails, caviar, sushi, eggs Benedict, crab bisque, it's insane.  This is a seafood buffet for sure so if you don't like seafood this wouldn't be your spot.  Truffle mashed potatoes, crab legs and the most beautiful dessert display.  This is the priciest buffet that I've been to but it is worth it.  At $98 per person, I got my fills worth between the crab legs and topping it with caviar.  This brunch fills up for sure so make sure that you make a reservation or else you may not get in.  For some reason I feel like this buffet isn't as well known as the others and I'm not sure why.  Maybe they don't want to pay the price.  We went around 1pm and ate until close at 2:30pm so we didn't want dinner after that.  This place is so good I wish that I could go right now....oh and I would say that this isn't kid friendly though I saw kids there.",

If there is any wait involved you'll be offered a glass of Perrier-Jouet champagne to start your day with.  Normally the wait to be seated is just a few minutes, but if any longer your glass will be re-filled.  If you're fortunate you'll be greeted by Warren, the Sterling Brunch manager.  A True customer service professional.  He checked in with us throughout our meal to assure that everything was great.    Our server for this experience was Sergio, who provided the perfect balance of attentiveness without being intrusive.  This brunch is to be enjoyed at a leisurely pace and Sergio never made us feel rushed.  He was very quick to fulfill the promise of unlimited champagne and made very appropriate suggestions on what food items to make sure and try.  The food is at a much higher level of quality than that of any other brunch we've ever had.  The carving station offers prime rib, lamb and a couple of other items.  If you can make room for one of the signature omelettes of lobster, boursin cheese and cognac you'll be glad you did.  The seafood options of lobster, crab, prawns and shrimp were great.  Filet mignon was tender and flavorful.  Now for the bad:  Nothing...only that this brunch is only offered on Sundays.    As I've said this is an experience, not just a meal.  It's a great way to have a very memorable time in Las Vegas.",

I made reservations probably 3 months in advance and it ended up working out!   Sterling Brunch is located at BLT Steak in Ballys. Since we had reservations, we did not wait at all for a table. Our waiters were Tony and Cesar and they provided the best customer service ever! They were both personable and engaged in conversation with our whole section. They were also very attentive. My champagne glass was always full and never went below half of the glass. They were amazing and definitely made my experience at Sterling so great!  Food was delicious as well! The selection is not as big as other buffets, but the main draw to Sterling is the quality dishes. All I ate was lobster, king crab, and filet mignon anyways, which were all so good! The desserts were delicious too! They also serve hot popovers, which I tried not to eat, but I couldn't help it!  This brunch is pretty pricey at $105 per person, but is definitely a must try!",

Prime rib   Filet mignon with herb butter    Lamb chops (a tad overcooked)   Thick cut slab bacon   Truffle mashed potatoes (perfect accompaniment to the proteins)   And.... CAVIAR. American Sturgeon Caviar to be exact (which I put on everything and totally made this so worth it!)  There were a few more options I didn't get to try since I didn't want to fill up on that, but it did sound delicious for next time: popovers, lobster bisque, lobster benedict, omelettes, etc. The dessert selection was pretty good too.

It is on the pricier side compared to most other buffets as well. So if you're not the strongest eater this might not be the best value for you. They only offer buffet on Sundays and reservations are usually booked months in advance. Worry not my friends, they do offer seating at the bar on a first come first serve basis! I was able to get a seat at the bar both times I've gone with little to minimal wait times! Once you're sat you'll have your choice of unlimited champagne or bloody marys...if you're in the mood for mimosas then just ask for a glass of orange juice and mix away! My favorites were the delicious lobster tails, king crab legs, oysters and lobster ravioli being a seafood lover myself! The lamb and the filet mignon were also excellent, which comes as no surprise considering the restaurant operates as a steakhouse outside of Sunday brunch! They also offer caviar, as well as your usual brunch fare! If you're someone who loves seafood and can really put it away, I suggest you give the Sterling brunch a taste if you're ever around on a Sunday!",

    "text": "To be quite honest, this buffet was just okay to me and didn't really seem to be worth the $105 per person price. Online reservations are only available for 3 months in advance, but my bf was able to make a reservation a couple days prior through his Amex concierge service. We were both pretty excited to come here especially after watching the video on Buzzfeed and reading the great reviews this place has. We were checked in and seated right at the time of our reservation and champagne was poured into our glasses -- it was free flowing bottomless champagne which was nice but I was pretty hungover from the previous day so I didn't really care for it.   This buffet serves premium items such as unlimited lobster tails, Alaskan king crab legs, jumbo cocktail shrimps, caviar, blue point oysters, filet mignon, lamb chops, prime rib, etc. The first thing I went for were the lobster tails and king crab legs. I was super excited for the lobster tails but it ended up being a disappointment because the meat was super mushy and rubbery and jut did not taste good at all. The king crab legs were good though so I would recommend eating more of that than the lobster tails. The lobster bisque soup was alright -- not too salty like most places. The filet mignon and prime rib were both good as well. The biscuits & gravy and truffle mashed potatoes were both pretty good. They also had a omelette station that everyone lined up for and you can choose the toppings you want in it. I had mine made with lobster and cognac and the chef added some herb cheese to the center as well. The sushi looked old and nasty like the ones at those $15 Chinese buffets back home so I didn't touch that.  They have a separate dessert bar with a pretty looking display of desserts that were not bad, but they don't have ice cream. They also have a Bloody Mary bar as well.   Overall, it was a good experience to be able to go to this \"premium\" buffet on the strip, but I don't think I would be returning. There isn't as much of a selection of food compared to the other buffets on the strip & the premium items such as the lobster tails were not that great. I would recommend going just for the experience -- the service here is extremely good as well, but other than that, I don't think I would ever want to pay $105 for this brunch again. Our bill came out to be well over $200 for 2 people after tax and tip.",

Our server was good and greeted us with champagne.  The buffet selection was small. We tried every item on the menu.  Sadly, the lobster was OVERCOOKED.  I tried to taste from several different batches but was repeatedly disappointed. King crab legs were small.  Caviar was a little salty even eaten with blini.  Lobster ravioli was a little tough. Tasted like it was reheated.  Lobster Bisque was okay. Made to order Lobster omelette was good.  Desserts were fancy but not memorable.  BEST items on the menu were the secret items ordered from your server.  They were the Eggs Benedict (choice of Lobster, Fillet Mignon and Pancetta) and Vanilla Souffle w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  I don't mind paying $110 per person for good quality and great tasting food.  Sterling Brunch is just OKAY.",

    "text": "Good god was it hard to get into place. First of all, if you want to make a reservation you have to do it over a month in advance. If not, you need to show up early (before opening) to get seated without too much of a wait.   We took one of my girlfriends for her birthday. Since we couldn't make a reservation on time we had to show up early. We were there 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line. But lucky for us, we were still part of the first group seated at the bar.  This place really is a hidden gem.   Staff was so fun! Lively, joking around, very friendly; it really added to the brunch atmosphere. Made it a great experience.  And then the food, gods the food. It's not the best lobster or steak you'll ever have, but it is still great and sooooo worth the price.   We all, almost quite literally, ate ourselves to death.   So worth it. I can't believe I had never heard of this place till recently, even though I have lived here for over 20 years. Will be back!",

    "text": "A hidden gem, that I hope stays low-key. $95/person, 11AM-2:30PM, no time-limit.   We called in at 11AM to find out that they were fully reserved for the day, however, the lady told us that the bar was first come, first serve seating and that you could just dine there. We packed up all our stuff and rushed over; luckily there were plenty of spaces available. Located inside the BLT Steak restaurant in the Bally's hotel which is tucked in the corner next to the SEA Thai restaurant.  Now, to explain why it's so damn expensive.  1. Unlimited caviar, 2. Unlimited lobster tails, 3. Bottomless Champagne (Perrier Jouet, they are not skimping!)   And that's just the beginning. The quality of all the food was impeccable. The lobster tails were huge and tender, and they managed to keep them constantly coming. Proteins, they had lamb chops, prime rib, filet mignon, bacon, prepared perfectly. For seafood, they featured jumbo shrimp cocktail, oysters, Alaska king crab legs, sushi, super fresh. I've only had caviar one time before, so I made sure to put it on everything I ate.   For desserts, mini dessert pastries, chocolate-covered strawberries, and a bread pudding french toast. All delicious, great finish to the meal.   We sat at the bar and service was amazing the entire time. Dishes were cleared out in a timely fashion, our champagne glasses were never empty. The best part about sitting at the bar, I got to watch Sunday football!   TIPS: Make reservations in advance, although the restaurant was never full the entire time we were there or you can test your luck with the bar seating.  They have a pretty hard set end time of 2:30pm, so I'd suggest arriving earlier so you don't feel rushed. We were way too stuffed afterward, and we didn't even get to try popovers, eggs benedict. omelets or lobster bisque. Looks like their menu changes from time to time so excited to see what else they have in store. Will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Ive been in the service industry since 1985 and I've been waiting to come here for almost 20 years, so, for my birthday, my fiance decided to take me. We anticipated it for weeks. I took the day off work, we got dressed up and arrived early for our 11:30a reservations. Our first disappointment (of many) came right away when we were offered champagne. The quality was beyond poor. I'd seen pictures posted of Perrier Jouet but what we got was the bottom of the barrel. Hardly drinkable. This was major selling point for us going here in the first place. Once we were seated the waiter brought us water and when he poured it from the pitcher, there were large visible pieces of food debris floating in each. Gross. Undaunted we went to get our first plate. We tried the lobster tail, filet, and crab legs. The \"lobster\" was almost uneatable. Mine had a strange almost mash potato consistency, like that you get with a bad piece of shrimp while my fiance was so tuff that she could hardly cut it. The crab legs were better, but not much. The hash marks to break the shell were far and in between making it difficult to get the meat and when you did, the pay off wasn't there. The filet was the only saving grace of this plate. It was better than to be expected at a buffet but still not to die for. Second round didn't fair much better. Maybe the crab claws would be good? Nope. Once opened the meat wasn't appetizing at all. The bacon was bacon. Still only a solid C+ and the sides were equally not memorable and the prime rib my girlfriend tired was left half eaten because of lack of quality. I've been in the service industry all my life and, without exaggeration, I've never been more disappointed by a meal.  There was no reason to dress up, there were literally people there in white v neck Ts, track suits and football jerseys. The food wasn't anything special at best and down right awful a majority of the meal. Although the wait staff was quick to fill our drinks there wasn't a feeling of being treated to a level that I'd expect for such a venue and still we felt obligated to tip 20%. There are literally a thousand places that we could have gotten a better meal for the price ($110 per person). The fact that large chunks of food were in our water right away and a manager wasn't informed is inexcusable. The mistake could have easily been forgiven with a table touch and apology from the manager but there was none. Being in the industry, I tried to reach out to the restaurant with no reply. If I was associated with this operation I'd be truly embarrassed.",

Champagne right away. For the buffet although it was a little short in terms of options, what they did have was good.  They do a lot of lobster and crab, and they have caviar as well. Carving station with chimichurri lamb chops, bacon, prime rib. Very high price for a buffet, but they do offer a lot of premium choices, and the food quality across the board is good. Overall it was ok, definitely not worth 100 per head - but get your money's worth and load up on king crab legs and champagne. 3/5",

    "text": "Reservations were hard to find online, so I called the restaurant and found one for 10:30am on the Sunday I'd be in Vegas.  I got there on time and checked in with the hostess, and she let us know we could wait in the tiny lounge until our table was ready.  It took 45 minutes to get seated, so that was a huge minus.  Once seated, our server was super busy running around, so I really respect his hustle.  He had a lot of tables to work, but still managed to find time to bring us our popovers and espressos.  At the end of our meal, we asked if there was any ice cream in the back, and he managed to round up some mango sorbet.  Now to the meat of the review: the meats.  The best thing about this buffet are all the meat options: lamb, prime rib, bacon slab, crab, lobster, and caviar.  The lamb and prime rib were great, but I really wanted to enjoy the things that differentiate this buffet: the lobster and caviar.  Caviar was good, and the lobster wasn't as terrible as the other reviews said (but wasn't great either).  Oysters weren't good, but it's not oyster season, so I can't completely blame them. The crab legs were horrible.  They were probably frozen.  When you finally got through cracking the rubbery shells, the meat just spilled so much water out when you bit into them.  Overall, for the price you paid, you could've gone to one of the other just as nice buffets (Bellagio, Wicked Spoon, Bachaanal) for almost half the price.  Skip Sterling's and go one to one of the other ones.",

    "text": "For the last few years, we have always wanted to go to the Sterling Brunch buffet at Ballys since we have heard a lot of great things about it, especially for the all you can eat lobster tails, filet mignon, unlimited expensive champagne, and the rack of lamb! We have even seen numerous YouTube reviews showcasing how terrific the buffet supposedly is (even though it was quite pricey), which made us want to go even more. For our most recent trip to Vegas (on the first week of June), we had finally decided to give it a try! In order for the three of us to get in, we had to book our reservations three months in advance (March) as is recommended. When we were talking to the lady on the phone with our reservation, she told us that the buffet was only $110 per person, which we thought was expensive, but not too bad for a once in a lifetime experience! All was dandy until we arrived for our reservation at the buffet. When we got there, the hostess lady had informed us that the price for the buffet had gone up to $125 per person! We were quite surprised by this price change since it meant that we had to spend more than expected. However, we were really looking forward to eating all the great food, so we went in anyways! When we finally got our plates with the food, we were very disappointed in how bad the lobster tails were! They were very mushy and bland with no taste to them at all! They definitely were not like the lobsters that we are used to having! Whoever cooked them must have did a bad job since they seemed like they were very overboiled! The lobster was supposed to be the main attraction for us too, so we were very upset at how bad they were! Other than the lobster, the filet mignon and rack of lamb were good (even though the lamb was quite fatty), the big shrimps and oysters were tasty, and the numerous fancy desserts were not too bad. On top of our overall disappointment, the champagne that they provided us didn't taste like the expensive stuff that they had promised. Instead, it tasted awful, which means that it must have been a cheap type like an inexpensive champagne that anyone could buy at the store! As for the service, it was really bad by the servers taking forever to take care of us, especially when it came to filling up our champagne glasses! For the high price that you pay, they should have double the wait staff to help everyone feel right at home instead of having to wait so long for the simple things like we did!  Overall, we were not happy with the Sterling Brunch buffet! It's definitely not worth the high costs of going that's for sure! We won't go back there again! We also wouldn't recommend anyone going since you would be just as dissatisfied as we were! In order for the Sterling Brunch to truly succeed in the future, I think they need to either make the buffet cheaper or increase the overall quality of food they are serving to match such a high price! In the meantime, at least there are plenty of other delicious buffets to go to in Vegas that are much cheaper and have better quality food! I guess the Sterling Brunch is not as sterling or excellent as it once was!",

    "text": "Open only on Sundays, I was very excited to get a seating at Sterling Brunch.  Of course I went straight for the high value items like lobster, crab legs, oysters, and caviar; I tried everything though so I got a full feeling of what the restaurant had to offer.    To begin, the lobster didn't taste fresh, though it was very meaty.  This applies to the crab legs and oysters as well - large but very mediocre quality.  The caviar was a nice touch and was salty and a hit at our table.  Popovers as always are tasty, but at a buffet, they're just fillers.  Filet was well overcooked, lamb was hard, prime rib was nice and tender, while the salmon was fantastic.  Salmon was the clear standout from the meal as far as entrees.  The banana foster french toast was quite good and rich and sugary, but kind of out of place, being one of the only brunch dishes besides eggs and sausage.  The dessert station was very week and wasn't replenished as much as I had hoped, with many times being out of lollipops and strawberries.    Champagne is great quality.  They'll keep you filled throughout your brunch.  Add in some juice flavors as well to make it a mimosa or even go crazy and try a bloody mary.  However, when the brunch ends on Sunday, at I believe 3pm, it really ends.  They literally take plates off the table, turn off lights and shoo people out of the restaurant.  That service is poor and they need to make less of a scene when it comes to closing out the meal.  Service from the beginning wasn't that great.  We waited 10 minutes although we had a reservation.  And then they didn't even offer us drinks while waiting.  Popovers weren't that warm, and constantly we had to flag down waiters for utensils and water refills.  Sterling brunch is cool for a one time event, but at $100+ it's not worth it.  Food wasn't of the highest quality and service is as you'd expect at Bally's  Glad I tried it out, but not a must in Vegas, especially with plenty of other high end buffets on the strip worth more bang for your buck.",

They have unlimited raw oysters, king crab legs, filet, lamb chops, and giant tails of lobster, all in the same place! But Sterling Brunch is like so many things in Vegas; glitz and glamour and a big less substance. After all, they can't have people eating them to bankruptcy so they put all sorts of safeguards in place. For starters, the quality isn't great. The filet isn't a quality cut, and both the steak and lobster are so saturated in butter that it's hard to eat more than one of each. I didn't think you could put too much butter on a lobster, but they managed. The oysters aren't bad but they're bland, and the king crab legs are pretty fresh, but the spines make it extremely painful to pull apart. The lamb chops are delicious - no regrets. The Sushi bar actually made me angry. No one's paying $95 for California rolls and practically-blanched shrimp nigiri. Why even bother with sushi if that's all you're serving? They do have caviar, which is nice, but I liked the lighter selections better. The tomatoes and mozzarella are enjoyable, and the berries are fresh. They also have Belgian waffles if you're looking for actual breakfast, and they have legit-looking bacon and eggs as well as a made-to-order omelet station. The dessert bar is dangerous! But not in the way I expected. People are literally pushing each other aside despite there being plenty to go around! My favorite is the raspberries in macaron cookies, and I'm a suck for a good fruit tart. The raspberry mousse thing is okay, and I like the lollipop with melty chocolate inside and the crunchy pistachio layer on the white chocolate strawberry. At least all this gluttony ended on a nicer note.   When in Vegas, Sterling Brunch is an experience you may want to splurge on, but maybe only once. It still costs less than surf n' turf at any reputable restaurant on the strip, and the bottomless champagne is fun, but I don't think I need to do this again.",

I made reservations and I highly suggest you do because I doubt walk ups are seated. This is an expensive brunch I believe our total for 2 was $224. Now I love me some seafood. I had lobster,  king crab, claws, crab omelet, shrimp, lamb chops etc. They do have made to order eggs Benedict as well. I was determined to eat my take at the only buffet we were able to go too. They are constantly pouring champagne for you so you'll never be empty. They have a make your own Bloody Mary station.  The dessert station wasn't that big I had macaroon and mousse. They did have a bread pudding on the buffet line but I suggest you eat that last or your eating will be done. I didn't eat anything else the rest of the day because I was so full.",

    "text": "When I heard about about Sterling Brunch, I knew I had to check it out.  Unlimited lobster tails? Crab legs?  Caviar?  Filet Mignon?  Colossal shrimp?  Popover bread?  Champagne? Mimosas?   For around $95 plus tip and tax bucks per person, this place was definitely worth a visit. This classy brunch buffet is tucked away in Bally's and yes, the service was totally awesome. Our waiter was friendly, accommodating and personable. Our glasses were never left unfilled - and yeah, I'm talking about the alcohol :)    Oh and when you walk in, don't expect your traditional Wicked Spoon-style buffet with countless food choices as Sterling Brunch has a limited menu.  Highlights - Lobster Tails - Super delicious. Like <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> good. The tails were so massive, flavorful and juicy. Don't forget to grab the butter :) Popover bread - Trust me. It's really, really good. Super warm, fluffy and just overall amazing.  Lowlights - Crab - Meh  Filet Mignon - Not too flavorful and some pieces were a bit too dry Ice cream - No one told us about it, which was a bummer  Pro-Tips -  - Dip the lobster tail in the lobster bisque  - Get some OJ for those champagne glasses - Reservation not available online? Call in.   Overall, this place was definitely a great place to check out. Unfortunately, once was definitely enough for me. For the price tag, I would rather go to Bacchanal Buffet for a cheaper meal with more options. However - if you're a huge lobster fanatic - check out Sterling Brunch. You surely won't be disappointed.",

Not holy hell I just had sex on a plane glad mind you but glad just the same! The room itself is a very well appointed although very dark lovely space! The tables are close together but not so close as you and your neighbor are eating with the same fork! The tables are well set with everything you would need for a pleasant meal! My server was pleasant and quite polite, but not extremely engaging, but she was quite busy! Her service was however exemplary, my Champagne Flute never reached the level of fully empty, nor did my water! Now onto the food, I had Three plates of food, and a dessert, and for the most part everything was delicious! The shrimp are plump and not over cooked and quite large! The grilled asparagus was perfect, the Filet Mignon was cooked more medium to well but yet still juicy, tender and delicious! The Lobster Tails were not perfect but they were damn delicious and quite large! I also had Prime Rib, yum, Alaskan King Crab Legs, yum, Lamb Chop, Outstanding, and Jonas Crab Claws which were horrible! They were small and way over cooked, dry meat, yet waterlogged and tasteless! I then finished my meal with the bread pudding which was amazing! Also that damn popover is addictive as hell, especially with some caviar on it! Overall this was an amazing meal, and well worth the cost! I hope to do it again soon!",

The first time we tried we found there is an hour wait and since the brunch is only on Sunday we were unable to go on that vacation. So when I got home I made reservations online 3 months in advance. The Sterling brunch is in the Bally Hotel close to the food court in the BLT steak house all the way in the back of the casino. We got to the front desk and there was a short line of people that made reservations and was immediately showed to our table. The Buffet itself is kind of small but filled with quality entrees. They had sushi, caviar, Lobster ravioli, chorizo hash, quiche, prime rib, leg of lamb, slab bacon, lobster bisque, omelet station, bacon, link sausage, waffles, raw oysters, large shrimp cocktail, stone crab Pinchers, champagne, bread and assorted desserts. At $106 per person it is probably not worth it as you can probably eat at a nice restaurant for that much and the food will not be sitting around.  Besides I got tired of eating lobsters after the third one.  and the king crab was kinda salty.",

Thinking to reward myself and This brunch was always in my bucket list however I crossed it out with quite disappointment.    After passed 30+ mins our RSVP time, waiting for them to set up our table.  We finally got seated.  Our server was the star, he was very attending, professional and proper, since we have a big group (like 9 people),  he seemed like never left the table, keep the champagne flowing.  He reminded me a professional English butler.   The best part would be the dessert table.  But we didn't plan to pay $150 pp for some chocolate creme.  Small variety of food choices on the buffet table, majorly seafood, lobsters, oysters, crabs, crab legs, salad, caviar, etc..  I was expecting everything should be perfectly cooked since the VIP price.  However the lobster tails were overcooked, quite rubbery, not just one, but all of them.  The lobster bisque was quite salty, we couldn't drink it, ended up we used it as dipping sauce for the lobster tails since they were dry and rubbery.  And most of the seafood are on the over cooked side.   I'm absolutely disappointed.  Even the free flowing champagne couldn't make the over-cooked seafood taste better.    Definitely not going back and will not recommend to my friends.  Go somewhere else order a la carte, I'm so done with buffet.",

    "text": "I say this as a frugal, coupon code-using, happy hour attending yelper: Sterling Brunch may be worth it.  Ever try to order caviar and lobster tails? This will set you back four Yelp doller signs.  If you go to a fancy steakhouse and order lobster tails, you're looking at $20-30 a pop. Here you can have as many as you want.  The champagne they give you -- unlimited, of course -- is around $40-50 depending on what store you buy it from. (I should hope you purchase this at Total Wine & More, #nopromo).  Caviar isn't really my thing but it can run for $50-75 / ounce.  So if I had a few lobster tails and some caviar, I'd already be approaching the price I paid. And of course there's bomb ravioli, steak and desserts, too.  Oh, and did I mention the service you get is top notch as well?  I booked reservations about three months in advance. I actually had no idea you could also wait without a reservation until I read these reviews.  Look - you're gonna spend $120-30ish after tip/tax. Obviously if you're struggling with funds, go elsewhere (hell - what're you doing on the strip in the first place?!). If you have some money to blow, I say the trip here is definitely worth it. I'm looking forward to the day I return.",

The only thing I wished was that he crab legs weren't so spikey. lol you'll definitely draw blood. But it's cuz they use king crab legs instead of snow crabs. Note to self, use your napkin!

I tried making reservations a week or 2 before and of course since they are only open 1 day a week (Sunday) they book out way in advance. They told me the bar is first come first serve so I decided to take my chances so we walked right up and they had 3 spots available at the bar. Yes it is pricey but you can easily get your $95 worth of food and drinks. If you drink they offer a endless Perrier-Jouet Champagne & mimosas and for the food endless lobster & lamb. They even have caviar (not the best kind). When a place has been having this sacred brunch for more than 30 years you know they are doing something right.",

Over the course of several days, I went online to make a reservation and Open Table continued to tell me it was \"unavailable\". So I called Bally's, where they told me they could not take reservations directly, I would have to call BLT Steak after 5pm. So I called BLT Steak after 5pm and they told me they couldn't make a reservation for my party of 10, that I would have to call a special group reservation line. Ok, so I called the group reservation line and they said they could not make a reservation for less than 14 people and to call BLT Steak back. Finally, I reached a snooty woman who told me the brunch was completely sold out for TWO MONTHS. WHAT?? 2 months??  I would be willing to visit Sterling in the future and update this review... but living in California, we usually don't plan Vegas trips for months in advance. Weeks, maybe - and it looks like weeks in advance isn't going to cut it.  Between the price, the ridiculous run-around, and the hostess with an attitude it's like they hate customers and are actively trying to scare people off. I don't understand how a brunch buffet in Las Vegas can be sold out for months. I guess the food is that good. Unfortunately I'll never know.",

    "text": "Wow.  We finally made it here last weekend for my birthday week of gluttony.  We should've stretched and did cardio before attempting to eat as many lobsters and drink as much champagne as we could.  Turns out I can only eat three lobsters.  I was trying for ten but with so many choices, I had to make room.  They had fillet mignon, asparagus, lamb( did not try but looked good) waffles, lobster bisque ( chop some lobster for a chunky bisque and dip your popovers) blinis, caviaaaaar ( fancy voice) and huge shrimps cocktails chillin next to painful spiny crabs.  Painful is what you feel trying to pry these things open as they do not come pre sliced.  Eh.  They also had sushi, a bloody mary bar with crispy prosciutto as a fixing.  So back to the caviar.  You can top them with creme fresh and capers, red onions and some shave white egg.  It was good but after about ten, I was over being fancy with the whole caviar experience.  I then moved to waffles where they had fresh berries or berries compote next to it.  The whole setup was really pleasant as the servers made sure empty plates were quickly rid of and the champagne was always topped off.  I forgot to mention that before you get your table, you are seated in a waiting area and served champagne while you wait.    Anyway, if your looking for a day of gluttony and have cash to burn( $105), schedule ahead and maybe fast the night before.  It's pretty good although I will not come back as I was in labor pains for the next 8 hours.",

    "text": "Once a year me and my gal pals pick a place to do our annual birthday / goal setting celebration. I'm so glad we gave the Sterling Brunch a try. Please keep in mind that you must book a reservation weeks in advance. We made a reservation 6 weeks ahead of time  and we almost didn't get a spot. There were only 2 openings left just to give you an idea. It's about $100.00 per person.   The brunch is at the BLT Steak house inside the Ballys Casino on Sundays. It isn't a huge area so the buffett isn't too crowded. They first bring out these huge muffin sized pieces of bread with soft butter. Whatever you do try not to eat that first because you will get full fast! I ate some of it and it tasted like a buttery croissant . Let's just say if they had fresh jam to go with it I may have not been able to stop myself.   I was thinking I would make a pyramid of lobster tails on my plate for a wonderful Yelp picture. Truth be told I was only able to eat 2 and a half lobsters. I mainly concentrated on the  lamb, lobster, mashed potatoes , jumbo shrimp and dessert, The next time I go I will try to just stick to seafood. They also have oysters , rock crab and king crab legs.   The waiters and waitresses are very busy so try to order more than one drink ahead of time. Our server had the chef make us some special birthday Crepe Suzettes which were absolutely delicious! This is a great place to go if you want to try something new in Vegas. This has been around for years but when I mentioned it to my friends many of them had no idea that it existed.",

The melted butter was quite nice.  Tried the filet but that was dry.  I thought for sure they would have lox and bagels but no luck.  Yorkshire pudding (popover) was the only bread of choice.  I wish I could have given it 5 stars I really wanted to love it since it was a birthday present.  Many of the larger buffets at more than half the price are much more enjoyable.",

    "text": "Came here as our big splurge meal for a Vegas weekend since this brunch costs $85 (not including tax or tip) with your Total Rewards Card.  If you don't have one then i think it's $90...Definitely the priciest buffet that I have ever been to for a meal, but i think you definitely get better quality everything - food, service, experience. Luckily we came here early on a Saturday around noon and the place was empty! our party of 6 was seated right away without a reservation. i feel like the high price tag def deters a lot of tourists away but worked for us that we didnt have to wait in any line haha. Note that the Sterling Brunch is held at the BLT Steakhouse space and there's no specific sign to indicate brunch so just be aware of that haha  On to the food & champagne...I loved that it was unlimited champagne and it was the good stuff. i think i drank enough champagne to recoup the $85 price tag haha. Also included are non-alcoholic drinks like sodas or coffee - pretty cool that you could get cappuccino too. For the food, you cannot beat lobster tail! although i thought the lobster itself was a bit too salty, once its dipped in butter that saltiness goes away haha. Also liked the prime rib, filet mignon, tuna tartar, crab claws & legs, truffle mashed potatoes, and lobster bisque. pretty cool that you can order some items hot/fresh from the kitchen in addition to all the food that is laid out for the buffet. also they will cook your meat made to order. my friend wanted a rare piece of filet mignon so the chef cooked him one - very cool.   im sure that our large party was kind of overwhelming and rowdy for the classiness of the Sterling Brunch haha but the service did not suffer from that haha. the service was amazing all afternoon! my champagne glass was not empty once and all our plates were consistently cleared out for us. our server was really friendly and knowledgeable and i even learned a little bit about the champagne making process haha.  overall this is definitely a splurge in vegas but i think its worth the experience and worth the great time. cannot beat that free champagne! haha",

I was standing by the Bloody Mary bar waiting to get assisted for 10 minutes. There were two bartenders and multiple waiters who walked passed me and just decided to ignore me. When paying $100+ per person, quality of service is everything. I will say for anyone thinking of trying out Sterling Brunch that it's a must-try, however don't count on the service to be top notch all around.",

    "text": "I have to say that I was very disappointed in the new sterling brunch.  The food was not even the same as it was before.  The lobster is no longer pulled from the shell and is now cut in half.  But the lobster was over cooked and dry.  The Alaskan king crab legs are not as big as they used to be and I feel that they were only giving the end bits of the crab legs.  If you have been to the sterling brunch before you will be really disappointed as several of the tables around me had stated it is no were as good as it was before.  Champagne still flows freely but they currently no longer include the Bloody Mary, which my wife was really looking forward to.  Lamb was good, prime rib was okay. Desert was good. No more sushi  I hope that these are just growing pains as they had just opened a few weeks ago but if this is what it's going to be like, I think we will not be back.  Service was okay, several stations were without food for a while and I had to wait for several items including cocktail sauce and even plates.  Selection is not as large as it was before, no duck and several items are plated individually sort of like they would do at the wicked spoon.  For example, Charcuterie and cheese plate were pathetic as you have to grab a bunch of premade plates.",

    "text": "After reading all high marks this place gets and pictures posted, I thought that I would finally take the opportunity to dine here while I'm here alone.  I was able to make a reservation the night before on Open Table.  This buffet costs $105 per person.  It does include unlimited champagne, mimosas, bloody Mary's and the regular sodas, coffees & OJ. The restaurant is on the casino floor right next to Buca Di Beppo all the way in the back.  Already out of the gate, I experience an issue.  I walk up to the hostess and stand right in front of her for about 10-15 seconds before she even acknowledges me.  At most high end restaurants, the hostess will greet you with a smile before you even approach their post.  Not here.  After waiting about 5 minutes for my table to be ready, I finally get seated and just watch the server walk past me with no acknowledgement.  So I decided to just go hit the buffet.  After coming back from the buffet, the server still does not come around to take my drink order until another 5 minutes has passed.  Throughout my brunch, the server did not refill my drinks and I had to ask him.  He paid more attention to everyone else around me.  I know I was dining alone, but it would have been nice to have been asked if I wanted a refill.  Towards the end of my meal, I asked for wet naps and the check.  He actually forgot the wet naps and disappeared for another 10 minutes before he brought my check. So that's my gripe about the service.  As for the food, I say that you are wasting your money here.  I would have been ok paying $25 for the quality of food they served here.  I know they have lobster tail, prime rib, lamb chops, king crab, stone crabs, blue point oysters and filet mignon to name a few, but the taste was not good at all.  I would highly recommend spending the $50 at Bacchanal in Caesars Palace over this place.  The buffet here is about 1/4 the size of Bacchanal's.  First off, the lobster was not dry or anything, it just had a weird taste to it.  I can't really explain what it is, but I was not a big fan of it.  The melted butter did not go well with it IMO.  I did have to squeeze lemon on top just to make it edible.  The prime rib was very dry.  The carver gave me the end where it was well done.  This is actually my fault.  I should have paid attention and asked for the medium cut instead.  The lamb chop was too gamey.  I just took one bite and I could already taste the gaminess and had to spit it out.  The filet mignon was very dry and lack flavor.  The shrimp cocktail was ok.  They were very big and plump though.  The rock crab was a joke.  There was no taste and just full of water when I bit into it.  Normally you can taste the brininess of the crab, but not here.  The blue point oysters for some reason didn't taste fresh to me.  I had some oysters yesterday at Bacchanal's and those were fresher than these.  Their dessert was very minimal at best.  Nothing there to really wow you.  I don't know if they had an off day or not, but I am not willing to risk spending another $105 to find out.  Even the table next to said that the buffet was not spectacular.  That's really saying something when you spend over $100 for a buffet.  I'm really surprised since this is a Steakhouse, you would think that their food or at least their meats would taste a lot better.   I don't like to write bad reviews, but I feel that it's my duty to let everyone here know not to waste your $105 on this place.  You will regret it afterwards.  Go to Bacchanal instead.",

    "text": "Finally tried the acclaimed Sunday Sterling Brunch at BLT Ballys and I am sad to say that I was let down. Was it hyped up too much for me? Were my expectations too great? I don't know.  What I do know/think is that for $100 a person, I do not think that it was worth it. At all. For that price tag, I was expecting better quality in both food and service but was let down in both regards.   After checking in for our reservation on time (and being a Diamond member), we still waited nearly 15 minutes for a table and watched 2 other parties that came after us get seated. Maybe there is another explanation for this but still a sour way to start brunch.   The brunch does come with free flowing Perrier Jouet champagne and my glass was never empty, I will attest to that! Cheers! However, it took me several attempts to get my orange juice refilled. :(  After finally being seated and drinks ordered, I explored the supposed star of the show: food! The buffet section was very.. minimal and underwhelming. I was surprised and caught off guard by the small selection that was offered. But at that point, I thought 'Hey, maybe the quality will blow you away and the selection won't even matter.'  How I wish that were True. The flavors were underwhelming. Items such as the filet were cooked unevenly, lacked taste and was cold by the time it reached my table. The sushi/nigiri selection looked like it had seen better days, falling apart on the plates and unappealing. Other items included lobster tails, crab legs, oyster shooters, omelets, french toast, waffles, charcuterie, etc. You get the idea. The dessert station (which was a section of the bar counter)  I just can't believe that at the hefty price tag, I didn't leave amazed and wowed. Rather, much was left to be desired. I'm hoping it was a fluke. But I'll never know.",

    "text": "Armed with my first Groupon (and only: just not how I roll) I took one of my favorite people for my 12th visit. Looking back, I wish I hadn't reviewed this fantabulous place earlier, because it would have been perfect for a Century slot a special place that has retained its glory since before I moved here.   Before joining Yelp, I had never heard of Groupons, but was thrilled to learn that basically a \"2 for 1\" offer was available; so I purchased it.  My last visit earlier summer '12 had wowed my guests from Hawaii as we celebrated a friend making Full Bird Col in the AF. Over the years I've gone with family, dates, friends...and only in June was I slightly disappointed by a few items. Recently, reading reviews from fellow Yelpers about hours of waiting, stale food, lack of service, I was concerned. Could there have been such a radical downfall in such a short period of time? I cannot compare SB to other buffets for two reasons: I've only been to Yelp's Bacchanal event and a soft opening of Red Rock's; I avoid them because of phobias (sneeze guards; gluttony; and generally poor manners to reach less than worthy food.)   When I called to make my reservation, I was relieved to hear that because of the onslaught of Groupon users, the initial December cut-off was pushed to early January. We arrived just ahead of our noon reservations to no wait, a smiling hostess and an immediate offer of Perrier Jouet champagne. We were guided to a table in the main dining room and met our very charming server, Javier.   I'd breathed a quick sigh of relief as this was the SB I was so familiar with and upon inspecting and choosing our first dishes, this was reinforced.  Even as a pescetarian (except for holiday charcuterie) I've always found that the lobster, crab, caviar, cheeses, sushi and sashimi, soups, other fish dishes, delightful desserts, endless superior PJ bubbly/Bloody Mary's always made the full price worth entry. On this occasion, again I agreed wholeheartedly.   * Please note: this was for a January '13 meal, my understanding is SB could be no more :( Hope that is not the case *",

That definitely made my day and made us fans of Sterling Brunch for life!",

Come to think of it its a really busy buffet so its just gonna be the case there being nothing special really. Good sure but not worth it. I would recommend going to a fancy restaurant and just buying everything seperate that you might like to eat this way youll get so much more superior dishes and drink. But if you like a hustle bustle environment experience in a restaurant at a over the top price go for it. After you can brag about it with no shame to everyone and look stupid for paying over $100 a piece.",

It's $85 a person and you have unlimited king crab legs, which were great, unlimited lobster tails which were fresh and great, unlimited filet mignon which were all cooked perfectly medium. If you prefer a different cook in your steak ask your server and they will make you one fresh. The caviar was excellent for what it was. Obviously not the high-end caviar but definitely 50 to $60 an ounce level stuff. The bottomless French champagne was amazing my girlfriend and I must have had 5 bottles :-) the desserts are great and the service was amazing. We will do the Sterling brunch every time we're in Las Vegas from now on.",

    "text": "I contemplated not writing a review because I really do not have anything good to say about this restaurant. Yet, it is so ridiculously expensive that I thought it was important to go over my experience and opinion of this restaurant. If you are into lobster and fancy items that are different seafood combinations and a lot of meat, you may like this place although my friends who like that said they were not impressed. Did I just go on a bad day? I am in complete disbelief right now. How is this restaurant one of the best places for brunch in Las Vegas? The Quality of what we attempted to eat today is disappointing. Was this restaurant way better before and that was the time when food critics applauded it? I am just wondering because, quite frankly, being someone who has eaten at the very best places in Las Vegas, this is nowhere near the best brunch in Las Vegas. What it is is way too expensive. For two people, the bill came out to $195!!! This is for simply ordering brunch for two people without anything else added. The brunch includes all you can drink champagne. It is not a cheap or expensive champagne but I didn't go there for the champagne. The buffet is mainly composed of seafood and meat in the form of Filet Mignon and beef tenderloin. There is also caviar and I was anything but impressed with the quality of the caviar. Our brunch time was 9:45 in the morning. If you are into eating heavy dinner items in the morning, then this may be the place for you. My friend, who is totally OK with dinner food in the morning, and loves seafood and eats it like it is going out of style, was disappointed. She explained that the oysters were not fresh and the lobster that she had looked and tasted like it was leftovers. She ate one oyster and said it tasted terrible and she refused to eat anymore as she was afraid that she would get sick. As for me, brunch stands for breakfast and lunch, not dinner. I get it: this restaurant wants to wow with fancy items which is great and you can have a separate table for that. If the restaurant was not this expensive, I don't think I would be as critical as I am at this point. Breakfast items that you would find at other high-end expensive brunches were completely absent or just pathetic at this place. I ordered an egg white omelette and I had very limited choices of what I could put in it. The guy who was cooking it for me ended up putting a load of butter before cooking the omelette and then proceeded to add way more of this liquid butter while the omelette was in the actual skillet cooking because it was sticking to the skillet. To make a long story short, the omelette was swimming in a disgusting soup of butter and had practically no taste. There were some baked potatoes and they were too salty. The bacon and sausage as well as asparagus were decent. As for fruit, what a joke! There were a few small bowls of fresh berries and that was it. No other fresh fruit to be seen. There were no wonderful different breads or toast to choose from. Poppers were brought to the table and I thought that they were disappointing and I have had way better. There was no choice of toast or bread anywhere to choose from. What there was was a beautiful dessert table that is perfect for dinner! There were small baby sized waffles and I tried them. They were dry and even the maple syrup did not help. The frittata was just terrible. The kitchen could make lobster eggs Benedict for you but I do not like eggs Benedict so unfortunately that was a bummer for me. Overall, this was, in my opinion, a late lunch/dinner buffet and from what I understand, my friends were less than impressed with the seafood or meat quality which they said was pretty much average and not one thing was outstanding. What was really sad is that the food was so average or bad, that each one of us only ate about half to three quarters of a whole plate and left two whole plates of completely untouched food as one bite made it clear that that was an item not worth continuing to eat. We paid a hell of a lot of money for that! I guess we all thought that for the expensive price tag per person, the food should be pretty good. Boy were we wrong. I would not pay more than $30 a person for what I was able to eat and the quality of what was served. I will not be going back and would never ever recommend this restaurant to any of my friends. There are many way better places in Las Vegas for brunch. How sad that after we paid our bill at this restaurant, because we did not want to give them a hard time as it is not the waiter's fault that we were anything but impressed, we all went over to The Creperie at the Paris Hotel and had delicious crepes for 1/9th of the price and those were worth a lot more! For the exorbitant price, this restaurant only gets one star. Just a gross disappointment if you like brunches that are extravagant with high quality food and a lot of variety for breakfast and lunch.",

    "text": "tl;dr:  Too pricy even for ayce lobster tail, lamb chops, caviar, and champagne unless you can REALLY put it away.  Timing is everything it seems when it comes to the selections...  Sterling Brunch is a high end buffet where you hope that quality doesn't have to take a backseat to quantity, but after filling our bellies I don't believe any of us thought that any individual item was the best they ever had...  It's $85 a head with a player's card from Bally's which is free to obtain so make sure you get one, then it's just tax and tip which brings you up to around $105 all in. At this price, I'm sure you could find a place that you like for any of the individual items offered at this AYCE buffet, but Sterling Brunch caters to those of us who are looking for a deal with the high end stuff;  where you can have your fill of champagne, lobster tails, and caviar;  where you can have your cake and eat it;  where for once quality might trump quantity.  A one stop shop for bottomless Pierre Jouet which is constantly being refilled in our flutted glasses.  This is probably the single biggest reason to try the buffet although it's normally a deal-breaker for me since I can't drink very much.  I didn't even get to try the caviar since I gorged myself on three plates of protein and was also eyeing the dessert too, so that was on me.  The biggest decision seems to be what to stuff in your mouth before your brain tells your stomach you've reached your limit.  So my problem mostly is that I took a fool's bet that I could get my money's worth from SB but in the end the house always comes out ahead...  Bottom line about the lobster tails is that they didn't live up to my tremendous expectations as there were large inconsistencies in texture from one to the next.  I wound up having three over the course of brunch and only the first one I had was \"acceptable\", the other two were \"mushy.\"  I couldn't explain how that could be since I had two from the same batch and one from another batch.  My son who also helped himself to multiple lobster tails seemed more content although he used a better strategy of going for whatever was being brought out at the moment he was getting his food...  The Lobster Ravioli pasta was thick and slightly chewy.  The sauce was thick as well.  Overall the dish was really rich and filling, for all of it's looks a pretty heavy-handed dish.  I thought it has a very similar taste profile to the Lobster Bisque although the textures were totally different obviously...  Although I was too sated to even try the caviar, my wife said:  \"it's ok, it's just caviar...\"   I took this to mean that it's probably not the best way to enjoy caviar at an ayce buffet, serving it in an individual ceramic although I noticed that they did offer it with traditional blini and garnishes...  I normally enjoy a salty, savory outside cut but I probably should have opted for a thicker, medium-rare inside cut of the prime rib.  They had already cut away the ribs so those were not an option.  In retrospect, I should have at least tried a thick slice of meat if only to try the cap which looked good...  The minuscule Filet Mignon was cutesy but not tender enough.  The Lamb Chop was marginally better and I feel as if I should have had another...  I was disappointed with all of the \"cold\" seafood:  the Poached Jumbo Shrimp and the Snow Crab Claws were insipid,  the Bluepoint Oysters were probably shucked a long time before I got to them and weren't the freshest, and the Alaskan King Crab Legs were too much work to open as they were scored but not cracked.  Skip...  The popovers were really amazing and airy but I couldn't enjoy them because I was afraid of filling up on bread.  The same with the desserts;  everything looked so good all I actually tried was a bite here and there and some of the fruit...  Although I came out stuffed, I didn't feel all that satisfied as if I had a terrific meal.  I probably had a more satisfying feeling after coming out of Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon but a lot of it probably has to do with feeling like I got a better value for my $$$$...",

    "text": "Is any brunch worth $85? Depends. If you are a meat and potatoes person, no brunch is worth more than $20 or so.  Sterling Brunch has, among the usual mundane brunch items, sturgeon caviar, lobster tails, Chilean sea bass, quality prime rib, and unlimited champagne. Honestly, even with all that, is it $55 better than the Bellagio Buffet's weekend champagne brunch at $30? Probably not.  Sure, you can go up to the caviar server 25 times and eat enough sturgeon caviar to put a dent in the world's sturgeon population, but then you have broken down a brunch experience into an economic ROI (return on investment) exercise and taken all the joy out of an entertainment endeavor.  So Sterling Brunch is good, and even somewhat unique, but it's not $85 good and it's not $55 better than Bellagio Buffet's weekend champagne brunch, which is the gold standard, in my opinion. But you've invested several days and hundreds or thousand of dollars going to Vegas and you just blew $500 at the Blackjack table in an hour, so what's another $85?",

Reservations are the best way to go about or you might have to go super early to possibly get a table because they're only open on Sunday. I checked into the front for my reservation and from the start, the hosts were very sweet. When we were seated, we were introduced to our server, Javier! One of the best thing about this place I might say is how fancy and upscale this place is but everyone doesn't intimidate you! You're given fine dining plate set up but if you wanna use the big spoon or small fork for whatever they won't judge you.. lol but also, it's just a very comfortable and easy going buffet where you don't feel embarrassed when you wanna try everything! Onto the food, this place has one line of food, a dessert station and a bar. There's not an absurd amount of choices but this place def has quality over quantity! Like they advertise, they have unlimited prawns cocktails, fresh oysters, stone crab, crab legs, lobsters, different kind of steaks, lamb racks, LOBSTER TAILS, sushi (but like fancy sushi, not the basic ones that most restaurant serve), caviar, salmon, etc. actually they have a decent amount of choices looking back... LOL. But the best part was every single item was fresh and had perfect seasoning!!! The food def didn't feel like a buffet but rather a regular restaurant that you order off the menu! Now back to the service! We were fortunate to have Javier as our server! I think he really added on to making our visit extraordinary. Not once was he intimidating or looked down on me when my crab would flew off the cracker.. he constantly came around to make sure the food we tried was good and best part, he kept the bubbly coming the min we only had half left in our cup! (Also included in the buffet package is unlimited Perrier Jouet and Bloody Mary's!) My boyfriend felt generous and gave him a nice tip for taking such good care of us and that tip did not go unnoticed. He came back around before we left and thanked us and honestly, you can tell he really appreciated it... he showed an extended gratitude to us by giving us a cup of champagne to go! What an amazing way to top off our experience. Overall he was such a genuine fella, not really someone you get to meet in an upscale restaurant! On the way out, me and boyfriend was so happy that we started out our day so great and to top it off, the host stopped me and gave me a long stem rose! This place just really knows how to treat their guests and knows how to leave an impression!",

Tender rib eye steak, rock crab claws, king crab legs, gigantic shrimp cocktail, oysters on the half shell, halved lobster tails, rack of lamb, prime rib, sushi, sea bass, roasted asparagus, crab cakes, mini crab frittata, mini cheese plate, mini caprese salad, mini yogurt and granola, one-bite dessert galore, and freshly made cheese popovers.  You can order cesar salad, caviar, lobster bisque, and tuna tartare, through the waitstaff.  I liked the savory items more than the sweet items.  Many of the lobster tails were too dry, the popover was a little on the doughy side, and the lobster bisque was delightful.  The chocolates at the dessert bar were tasteless and there were fruit flies hovering over the goodies.  Other important info: located at BLT Steakhouse inside Bally's, $90 per person which includes good champagne (and will not be reduced if you don't drink alcohol), quality over quantity here, it was quite tasty and well worth it if you prefer to have dinner food for breakfast or lunch.",

    "text": "I made reservations for 2 in June directly with the restaurant, when Open Table didn't show any availability for my date of choice which was Aug. 13 2017. My advice is to call the restaurant directly and not rely on the internet. I scoped out the location several days prior, to make sure my reservation was on the books and to find it's location in Bally's because it is tucked into a little corner you could easily miss. First impressions: I was disappointed that people waiting for a walk in seat at the bar were seated and served first instead of those of us with table reservations. Small complaint I know, but it seemed odd to me for such a high end brunch. As soon as we were seated, we were poured champagne and offered the buffet. We headed straight to the dessert station because I had read on another review that the large strawberries weren't replenished as much as the other dessert so we filled a plate each of dessert first, then got into line for the food. My first course was a combo of lobster tail, caviar, king crab legs, filet mignon (med rare), mashed potatoes. DELICIOUS...except the caviar. I've had caviar before but this wasn't good at all. Mushy and watery with no flavor! Went back for shrimp and snow crab...didn't eat either option. Very rubbery. I went back for another serving of king crab and filet, then several more crab legs. We happened to make friends with both single diners on each side of our table and we all had a great time! We requested OJ after the first champagne serving and it was brought right away. Our glasses were never empty until the end of service. I have to admit we ate and sat for a long time but we compensated our waiter's tip for 2 seatings. I am glad I did my research because my companions didn't know about any of the off menu items offered until I mentioned them. However this was a wonderful brunch and one you should experience.",

    "text": "Came here specifically because of the lobster. Unfortunately, they were dry and tasteless, which i should had anticipated knowing that they were Australian lobster tails rather than the much sweeter maine lobster. Had they been Maine lobster it would had been worth the almost $100 price tag as the rest of the buffet was at best 3 1/2 stars. Didn't see the caviar as they were either out of it or hiding it due to cost. Due to price and value it overall only gets 3 stars. However, if you like all you can drink champagne, which i loved in my younger years, it gets all 5 stars along with a 5 star hangover.  Update: they just renovated the restaurant and even changed the name. Will retry updated version of the sterling buffet very soon and update review.",

    "text": "Holy mother of pearl.    Now, THIS is the buffet of buffets.   At $85 a pop (remember to bring your Total Rewards player's card for a small discount), come get your endless caviar, filet mignon, LOBSTER TAILS, sashimi, made-to-order omelettes, veal, lamb, creme brulee freshly brulee'd, oysters, and more!!  Oh, and *bottomless* Perrier-Jouet SHAM-PAG-NUH (champagne)!!!!  Incredible service.  I couldn't find any faults--not because I was intoxicated.  No really, I found no faults with the servers.  They were all wonderful.  Really.  Need I say more?  It's worth trying it once.   Go big or go home.",

    "text": "Obviously for an $85 per person brunch Buffett you know it will be special. In this case the food selections certainly are. All you can eat oysters, lobster tails, filet mignon, prime rib, lamb chops, and much more.  I also tried two omelets which rate high as the best omelets I've ever eaten and I don't even like an omelette. The three big issues for me are value (not for what you get but for what you really need), service (not as sharp as I'd have thought and our waiter seemed less than engaged surprisingly) and ambiance (that old Vegas style restaurant with no natural light of any kind and honestly it's still just a buffet).   My personal opinion is that once you surpass a certain price point buffets really are silly. Our meals with tax costs us $97 per person!! Plus tip. All that spent and I still have to serve myself from the buffet. How does this make sense? Unless you are so greedy that you will honestly eat a couple lobster tails, five filet mignonette, etc how is there value here?  I went to Morels and had a memorable meal with amazing service and alcohol and I spent the same as we did on a buffet where you serve yourself. Maybe I'm a snob but for $200 plus tip I'd rather have one amazing plate instead of piling my plate high with filet mignon. If you can afford $97 for brunch per person I'm assuming you've eaten pretty well and a lobster tail is not going to impress you (I can get that at Red Lobster).  I hated the ambiance. I like old Vegas and respect it as a local, raised in Vegas. But no light and just a depressing decor is not what I want for a relaxing brunch.  You can spend your $200 a lot better ways in Vegas for two.",

    "text": "Good Brunch, expensive but good We had Sunday Brunch at Bally's in April and it was good. If you go, do 2 things: 1) Make a reservation 2) Ask to be seated in the area where Jason is the waiter. Our waiter was not the best, not even close. Jason will take care of you.  The brunch does have fresh caviar, sushi, King crab legs and lobster. You have to ask for the Caviar and Sushi. They won't bring it out to you automatically. Try the champagne and get lots of it. It's french champagne and it's the GOOD stuff. We must have drank at least 2 bottles of champagne while we there. We came out stuffed and buzzed, exactly like we wanted to.  I would reccomend doing this just one time...just to say you've done it.",

For about the same amount of money, you get unlimited champaign, oysters, lobster tails, caviar, filet mignon, king crab legs, ......  Even the bread tastes good. The service is superb as well. I highly recommend this place. The restaurant has limited seating. So I'd like to keep it as a secret :)",

But the price of over $125 per person (when tip included) gets you higher end champagne and decent sake plus food you would get elsewhere in Vegas for about $65.  Unless you plan to drink a ton at brunch, you are better off going to some of the premier buffets and saving yourself 1/2 a C-note!",

    "text": "My cousin goggled the top buffet spots in Vegas and Sterling's came up as the #1 brunch buffet.  We were a little hesitant because it was about  $100 a person, but the hostess told us to check out the selection of food they offer and allowed us to scope out the place.  That was a hook, line, and sinker!  After opening a few of the chaffing dishes and seeing those lobster tails and king crab legs... we were in!  Their lobster tails were big not like Rio's seafood buffet.  I think they were even bigger than what I've eaten at various 5 star steakhouses.  Anyhow, bottomless fillet Mignon, prime rib, king crab legs, oysters in a half shell, sea bass, lamb chops, lobster tails, caviar, and champagne  I would have done a full 5 stars, but I wasn't a fan of their sushi selection.  It didn't taste fresh to me.  And their dessert bar wasn't the best I've had.  I didn't get a chance to eat their crepes, but yes, they were freshly made by a waiting chef.      Other than that, service was excellent.  With the hefty price tag, I'm not sure if I can be a regular on this, but once in a while is fine and for me it's worth every penny and a must try in Vegas!",
