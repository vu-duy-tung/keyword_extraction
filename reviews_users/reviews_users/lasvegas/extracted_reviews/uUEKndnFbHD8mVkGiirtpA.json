    "text": "I first discovered Tommy Bahamas Restaurant while living on Maui (Wailea).  I always enjoyed that location and I was surprised to stumble upon T.B.'s here in the middle of the desert. I thought it was a mirage at first sight. Just as I remembered from da island. Very tasty food and impressive cocktails all in a beautiful West Indies style dining room right in the middle of Town Square. Only problem.....it's on the other side of town so I can only hope for a location here in Summerlin. I like the crabcakes and one of their signature salads. Add a rum cocktail and if you close your eyes, you just might think you have escaped to a very nice island.",

Pleasant decor, in that Tommy Bahama caribbean kind of style. Ahi Fish Tacos were delish. Loved the Tortilla Soup. Prices were great. Side salad was fabu. Server Devin was pleasant and attentive.  Wish they had more locations so I could go more often.",

Our server was cheery, attentive, professional, and had a great sense of humor.  The Mai Tai drinks were phenomenal - not too sweet, the right amount of rums (perfect dark rum float), completely refreshing.  The food was very good.  Hubby had House Roasted Pork Sandwich - a huge helping of pulled pork in a blackberry brandy bbq sauce (so delicious!) on top of fresh crunchy slaw with skinny crispy fried onions piled on a toasted bun.  It was served with some of the best fries around.  I had a cup of the crab bisque, which was very tasty but really thick in consistency.  Too thick for my preference.  The Bungalow Salad, however, was fantastic.  Made with greens, dried blueberries, Feta cheese, tomatoes, pepitas, and toasted almonds and macadamia nuts in a lemony vinaigrette, it was excellent!",

Kaaren is honestly the most amazing host and representative of this restaurant! She walked us through the property and showed us the private dining space. If you are in need of  private or semi-private dining for ANYTHING this is the place to go! The decor is beautiful and the food was well above our expectations.    The bartender makes amazing drinks - there are no weak drinks here! We started off with the coconut shrimp and then for our main course I had the Linguine with clams and my husband had the Fish Tacos (make sure SOMEONE in your party gets these).  This is by far our new favorite restaurant and I cannot wait to start sending our clients here!  Thank you to Kaaren and the entire staff for their hospitality! We will see you soon!

    "text": "Sooo...after my second time at Tommy Bahama's, I thought I would review the place. I ordered the Rustic Pasta, which I have tried before in a red sauce from friend's plate. I remember it being amazing pasta, I was quite surprise that pasta could be this good at Tommy Bahama's, after all they just sell clothes. Anyway...I ordered the Rustic Pasta for myself this time. I was quite disappointed with the dish this time around. They had changed the whole dish! It was basically a sour soup with tomatoes and pasta. Ew. My friend ordered the same thing and was quite disappointed too.  We called the server over to politely ask if there was a reason why the pasta tasted the way it did, and why it had changed from before. The server, also named Tommy did not hesitate to give us the menu to change our order. I ordered the special, Parm crusted mahi mahi and green beans and lemon infused rice.   By the time the second dish came out it had two hours since we sat down...I was starving. I tool a bit of the fish and it was meh, I took a bit of the lemon infused rice and it tasted like soap. I swear if the establishment isn't Indian or Asian-decent they EFF the rice up!! I swear. I decided just eat the mediocre fish and green beans off my plate and call it a day. At this point I was so exhausted from waiting for dinner I had the server just pack it. I figured I could re-purpose the food to look and taste like something else.  I hear their happy hour is good for tacos and run drinks. Will stay away from Tommy Bahama's (if I can help it).",

I ordered the crab cake appetizer as a small portion, which they allow you to do on selected items.   It came with a wonderful asian coleslaw, and was very refreshing and delicious.   Wish I ordered the full size appetizer, it was far better than expected!  I also had the pork sandwich with blackberry brandy barbeque sauce.  It's basically a pulled pork sandwich with onion straws, and it was very good, as were the crispy fries.    The only reason that they didn't get 5 stars was due to the timing of my food.   The sandwich came out before the appetizer, so I had to ask to see if they forgot this item.   A minor issue, since this was ordered at the bar, and I'd expect table servers to be more on their game.  I had the New Belgium Ranger IPA on tap, very nice!   I didn't bother having them list all beers on tap, but this was a great option.  Overall, I will definitely be back, and would recommend this to others.",

    "text": "\"If you like pina coladas...\" As I do, then head over for happy hour at Tommy Bahama's in Town Square. I usually frequent Yard House and Miller's Ale House to get my half priced drink on so Tommy Bahama's was a refreshing change of pace. It is from 4-7 pm everyday and offered only in the bar.  The bar was super crowded and it's easy to see why. We tried a few appetizers such as their ahi poke, chimichurri sliders, calamari noodles and fish tacos. Everything was delicious! My favorites were the sliders and fish tacos. Portions are rather small - the ahi poke was like amuse bouche - but the quality of the food made up for it. Prices weren't too bad but it adds up quickly since I wanted to try pretty much everything on the happy hour menu.  There was a musician who sang and played acoustic guitar. His melodic voice almost made me think I was on vacation.  I would definitely come back to try their regular menu and for some more pina coladas.",

It was a little too sweet for me - too much vinaigrette type sauce... added some lemon and it was good to go. I tried my friend's filet mignon and that was definitely good.  The peanut butter pie was like a giant reese's peanut butter cup. It was good for the first few bites but definitely too much for a full dessert.   The service was a bit slow and probably was due to the dinner rush. I don't know if it'd be a good place to come when you're super hungry. Seating was ample though.   Definitely worth another visit.  * update * Just returned for a second run of their Restaurant Week deal. What I said before stands. Food tends to run a little sweet and salty. The chicken lollipop was good BUT REALLLLLY sweet/overpowered by the sauce. The filet mignon was well seasoned, but a little on the salty side.   The food is pretty solid... and you can't really go wrong. The service this time was superb and on point. Overall win in my book.",

The staff was excellent and were so very attentive. The manager Karen is literally the sweetest human ever and treats her guests like all restaurants should! She was so happy that I had found my wedding gown and gave us a free dessert. She personally came to ask how we were doing throughout our lunch. Our waiter Doug was amazing as well and knew everything about the menu and helped us decide what we wanted to eat. Everyone had a big smile on their face and the food was delicious! I had the crab bisque and it was amazing! So much flavor and just the right amount! Don't even get me started on the bread fresh out the oven and the sweet butter that goes with it! It was some of the best bread and butter I've had when out to lunch! Then our dessert, the pineapple creme brulee was the best I've ever tasted! I will definitely be going back and make sure to ask for Karen and Doug! They are amazing!",

    "text": "We never come to Las Vegas without stopping here.  If a restaurant can be a vacation unto itself, this is the place.  MAIN COURSES These are huge and delicious (notably the fish tacos, crispy fish sandwich and macadamia nut crusted salmon to name the ones I've tried.) APPETIZERS Instead of the large entrees, I prefer to order an appetizer (such as the Ahi tuna tacos or Ahi poki Napoleon) and salad (the bungalow salad sounds simple, but it's SO delicious!) so I have more room for the so amazing cocktails and dessert--more on those later.  My husband adores the chicken tortilla soup and the seared scallop sliders.  And we always order the macadamia crusted goat cheese, even though we have the cookbook and make it at home from time to time.  I should mention that I'm allergic to shellfish, so I can't eat shrimp, scallops, crab, lobster, etc., but I never feel deprived here, even though TB Cafe places a strong emphasis on seafood in general.  THANK YOU! COCKTAILS  These are heaven.  Like vacation in a glass.  Best pina colada anywhere.  Yummy mojitos.  A key lime martini to die for.  Blood orange margarita--yes, please.  My husband ordered none of these, but was very happy with his order.  (Hmm, memory of beverages consumed is a little foggy, wonder why?) DESSERT:  I keep trying to resist the key lime pie to try something different, but I can't do it.  My husband has ordered the pina colada cake and loved it, but his current favorite is the pineapple creme brulee served in a thick slice of carmelized pineapple.  I would love to try the malted chocolate pie or the peanut butter pie, but the key lime pie has a hold on me... SERVICE:  So warm, welcoming & attentive without being overly familiar.  They're happy to carry on a conversation about food if you engage them, or they'll drop off your cocktail & appetizer and just keep an eye out for when your head pops up or your drink gets low.  My understanding is that a lot of the staff has been here since they opened (close to 10 years ago) and that tells me they treat their staff well, and their staff is loyal to them.  With plenty of other restaurants & bars in the LV area, that's saying something impressive.  I believe our server's name was Matt, and he was perfect. DECOR:  I'm not exaggerating when I say we have seriously investigated decorating our home in a similar style.  Love the tropical wallpaper, the combination of dark and painted-white woods, the floral pillows in the wooden booths, etc.  It's a relaxing color palette with colors of sand, golden pineapple, and shades of green, much like resorts we've visited in Hawaii and Florida. MANAGEMENT:  We met the sales manager Kaaren Kragerud for the first time during this last visit, and she's the real deal.  She spent quite a bit of time chatting with us about the offerings at the restaurant and at the store, and overall put a friendly human touch on an already great experience.  She's amazing, and we'll ask if she's in when we visit from now on.   SUMMARY:  Just go.",

But, I've been here a couple times now and everything I've tried has been tasty.   During my last visit we got the scallop sliders ($11.50). There were 2 scallops in each slider, with a good bit of spice from the chipotle aioli. They've not your typical slider, but tasty nonetheless.  The Saba steak salad ($17.50) was also delicious. Plenty of tender, well seasoned steak over a salad large enough for two. It also had some grilled slices of potatoes, tomatoes, and a tamarind vinaigrette.  They also have a kids menu. My son is so predictable. He always goes for the chicken tenders. They're lightly breaded and the skinny fries are excellent  With drinks it came out to about $60. Yeah, a little pricey for lunch. From what I hear they have one of the biggest collections of rum around. So, if that's your vice stop by to check it out.",

We couldn't get any desserts because we were full but our server (he was Asian but I cannot remember his name) and manager (I remember her name-- it was Emily) were both super friendly and very accommodating. I remember Emily's name because she gave us a free dessert card to use in NY!   Despite the date when we went (which was Jan 2nd) and despite the fact that it was on a Friday night, the restaurant was not crowded at all and we could not have asked for a better experience.  AMAZING PLACE. I would highly recommend it to everyone.",

The setting was beautiful and I would love to sit in the patio the next time I go back and look out to Town Square. As far as drinks, I had a holiday special (can't remember the name) and my husband ordered an ale...can't complain! I also plan on going back for happy hour.",

It's in a good location, provided you don't mind going to Town Square. The food is good, and I like that it changes seasonally, but most of the menu is exactly what you'd expect to find at a restaurant that aims to please everyone.   So I've been there before, and I'll go again, and I like the place. I just can't think of a reason to rave about it. Sometimes that's just what you want.",

It never seems busy in there for dinner, which is a shame because it's a cute restaurant and the food is great!  BF and I came for a dinner date last Friday and sat in a booth in the bar area.  There was a singer performing some laid back well-known songs.  It was quite empty so we had the place to ourselves.    We ordered ahi tuna tacos, a crab cake and shared a large filet mignon.  I ordered a martini with cantaloupe (can't remember the name).  EVERYTHING was delicious.  They even brought us our steak already split up onto two plates for us with our own sides on each plate, without us even asking.  Now THAT'S what I call customer service.  I can't wait to go back and eat more food off the menu.  They are a bit pricey but the food is worth it.    Their drinks are also ALWAYS on point.  Yum!  Highly recommended for a date or a small group.  Not really a place to meet and mingle as there was no one there!!",

    "text": "I decided to swing by Tommy Bahamas for restaurant week because the menu they had looked promising. We picked the 30 dollar option and from it we both got the crab bisque and coconut shrimp,  then differed on the entree where I got the ribs and he got the fish and chips. For dessert I added on the key lime pie.   I was surprised how fast service was,  after each course they soon brought over the next,  and our waitress was super attentive.   I was happy to see they carried beer from kona  brewing company.   I appreciate the unique floral notes it tends to posses,  but I I was unsure which one I wanted.  She brought me samples of the two I was contemplating so I could easily decide.   So down to the food.   The crab bisque was creamy, flavorful,  and had nice pieces of crab inside.  It went great with the heavenly bread they supply the table.  So hot and buttery mmmm  I'm having a moment just thinking about it.   The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and coated, golden and juicy on a mango dipping sauce,  with a savory jicima slaw. The best coconut shrimp I have ever had.    The ribs were where they lost me a bit.   They had this blackberry sauce which was OK,  but the ribs had to many dry hard areas.  It had the same great jicima slaw, which seems to be a common side with many items,  and the cauliflower mash was great.  However, since the star of the dish was the ribs it failed to continue the joyful momentum I had started to feel from the former dishes.   My boyfriend got the fish and chips and the spin on the dish was the chips were made of yucca instead of potatoes.  The fish was battered well, not the best fish and chips I have ever had, but solid still.  It also had the jicima slaw, which they call island slaw actually.   After all this food I was exploding so I asked them to switch my pie, which for restaurant week was only a 5 dollar addition, to a to go order. It ended up being delicious.  Great tart to sweet ratio,  solid crust, and lovely whipped topping.   This was the first time besides happy hour I had dined at this establishment,  and over all I could definitely see myself coming back for dinner again...especially for those shrimp.",

    "text": "Dined here for restaurant week 2018 with my friend Jessie and my 19 month old son. They immediately brought my kiddo a kids menu with crayons and a working high chair! Our server Pascha was very friendly. We both ordered drinks from the bar and then looked over the menu. We chose this spot because they had two lunch menus, a $20 and a $30 with 3 courses; appetizer, soup/salad, and entree.  I went with the $20 menu and got the grilled artichoke, caesar salad and cuban sandwich. I had a hard time choosing between the sandwich or the tacos so I asked Pascha to surprise me. I really thought he would bring the tacos, especially since I over heard him tell another table they are a best selling item, but whatever. The grilled artichoke was delicious. It was grilled and had garlic butter and parmesan cheese on it, and it came with a yummy lemon tarragon aioli dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again. The salad was your typical ceasar salad, except instead of chopped lettuce it was lettuce leafs. The Cuban sandwich was okay, but really I think I would have preferred the tacos. It came with their island coleslaw and jerk yucca fries which were spicy! To drink I had the Kona Brewing Hula Hefewiezen which was yummy. Tasted a bit like Blue Moon but not as fruity. We also were brought warm bread and honey butter with our meals.  Finally it was time for desert. This was not included with the restaurant week special but it was $5 and I can't ever pass up dessert. I chose the pb pie and it was delicious! The crust was salted pretzel - yum. The pie tasted like a salty peanut butter cup.   I have to mention I ordered my son the $7 chicken fingers with fruit and asked for ranch instead of honey mustard and the waiter said they don't have ranch. What?!!? I've never heard of such a thing. So fellow ranch lovers, take note! The chicken fingers were crispy and yummy and came with a side of fresh fruit. The boy was very happy as he gobbled most of it up.  I love restaurant week because it gives me a chance to try places I otherwise would not have. This is one of those places. I would for sure come back for a meal here.",

We were here during happy hour, so we enjoyed several different appetizers and drinks that were on the happy hour menu! The drinks were delicious, and the food was great! My favorite were the blackened fish tacos.  They only honor the happy hour menu in the bar (which there wasn't enough seats for our large group) and on the patio outside. It was a nice evening in Vegas, however it was very windy! We all decided to sit outside because we wanted to take part in happy hour. The large umbrellas they had outside to give us shade were blowing everywhere, and one even fell on my friend causing her drink to spill all over her. It was a little weird because the waiter turned it on us saying that \"they usually don't seat people outside when it's windy, but that they made an exception for us\". Mind you, there were many other parties sitting outside at that point so it wasn't just us. The manager never came out to apologize and even if they made an exception for us, the manager still should have apologized for the incident and made sure my friend was ok. We weren't even asking for a free drink or food, just a sincere apology would have been nice! I wouldn't mind coming back here again because the food was great, but I will definitely keep the experience I had in mind next time.",

    "text": "It seems hard to believe that any of the four founders of Tommy Bahama could have realized just how big their brand would grow back in 1993, but having since merged with a larger company the store has nevertheless grown into a worldwide enterprise focused on \"island-style living,\" over 150 stores and counting with several harboring their own Restaurant and the company even manufacturing their own label of Rum.  Known for their love of khaki and Hawaiian button-ups with leisurewear bleeding over to a whole line of home decor, nothing in particular suggesting the desert but still sold in five retail outlets plus department stores throughout Sin City, it was during a recent trip to Town Square that the decision was made to investigate Lunch on the patio adjacent a recently erected Christmas Tree, the breezy environment befitting the concept without feeling overly \"themed.\"    Toqued by Chef Ruben Vasquez Cruz and second-in-command Armando Vargas, the much-talked about Happy Hour, fresh Fish \"flown in daily\" and a substantial Cocktail list forming the backbone of a menu expectedly intended to please a broad audience, it was mere moments after checking in at the hostess stand that a four-top under umbrellas was offered on the restaurant's patio, a list of daily Chef's specials offered in addition to the typical bill of fare with most of the choices centered around Fresh Seafood.  Apologetic up front when stating that both service and the kitchen were understaffed on this particular afternoon, a rush of traffic completely filling outdoor seating with several additional groups and families sat in the spacious dining room or around a bar area displaying NCAA Football, it was still with relative efficiency that a middle-aged man from Florida took orders for drinks while additionally keeping up with refills of Water, first taste offered in the form of a foamy Pina Colada entitled \"Coconut Cloud\" alongside the refreshing Cucumber Smash and a \"No Proof\" Martini that tasted like Cuban Cafe con Leche with a gentle Citrus note.  Ready to place an order fairly quickly, the aforementioned staffing situation delaying the arrival of a warm basket of Rolls with Honey Butter until later, it was as the group watched several folks posing around the tree that six jumbo shrimp dipped in shredded Coconut Batter arrived alongside a Half-Rack of Ribs for the youngster, the \"World Famous\" item par for the course atop a dollop of tropical Chutney while the slab of Pork was tender and moist beneath sweet glaze, the sugar outweighing any suggestion of \"spice\" a theme that would be repeated throughout the meal.  Offering several menu items including daily specials in two sizes, the smaller suggested as an \"appetizer\" but equally appropriate as an entree for those with modest appetites, it was alongside a sharable bowl of Fish Soup that had unfortunately boiled too long that a $15 Flatbread arrived, the unannounced pile of Arugula seemingly unnecessary at first but presumably added to balance the Honey-soaked Onions that would have otherwise overwhelmed everything including the texturally pleasing Mushrooms and medium rare Beef.   Rounding out entrees with a three-piece order of Jumbo Prawns, their snappy flesh and a bit of smoke from the grill a vast improvement from the rubbery Scallop or Shrimp from the Soup, Chefs Cruz and Vargas showed a deft hand when preparing Pearl Cous Cous with fresh Vegetables and light Cream plus tender Mushrooms, the quality of each ingredient as well as the preparation as a whole on par with what one might find further up the Strip for at least $10 more.  Told to \"save room for Dessert,\" a mock-display near the front door brought tableside to assure a sale that was already guaranteed, it was alongside a Double Espresso poured over Ice that three of the Tommy Bahama's signatures were selected, the Peanut Butter Pie eaily the richest with a thick and creamy base balanced by finishing salt as well as the pulverized Pretzel Crust while two tropical choices proved even better, the Pina Colada Cake fragrant and moist without being too dense while the Creme Brulee made from caramelized Pulp and Vanilla Custard re-inserted into the hollowed Rind may just be the best version served in Las Vegas.  ***1/2 Dollar for dollar and plate for plate Tommy Bahama Restaurant and Bar occupies a position somewhere between the likes of Cheesecake Factory or Elephant Bar and places like Joe's Stone Crab or Aquanox on The Strip, certainly not \"destination\" dining but at the same time far better than it needs to be for an upscale dining option in an shopping mall.",

The Hostess set a tone of fun and light-hearted happiness. Our server, Carrie M., was great and she gave extra attention to the dietary restrictions of our table mates. The food was ok. The scallop sliders had too much bun for the thin scallops and the \"chips\" in the Fish and Chips we're loaded with pepper, effectively killing any flavor. The ribs were perfect, as was the salmon. This is not my first time at TB, nor will it be my last visit. I just wish I could have raved about it all this time.",

We then had the ribs (melt in your mouth and that bbq sauce is yummmm), the fish tacos were also great!!  We couldn't stop there, we had to have coffee and dessert. If you love chocolate like me, their chocolate cake with Oreo crust is the best choice, just make sure that you save enough room; the cake is super rich and it was too much for both of us. I'm sorry, I forgot our server's name, but she was really nice and helped us with a couple choices. She really made our experience even better.",

They help you make the best choice by asking good questions and even brought us a free appetizer to sample.

This restaurant is also tied into a clothing shop, Tommy Bahama of course, and also has a very nice bar area. There are rooms for big parties and the building is very spacious.  The menu is tailored around higher end food with the starting price of around $25 for entrees and $10 for appetizers. They have a very wide selection of liquors and wines to complement the menu.  The appetizer ordered was the lump crab bisque. It was a smaller portion and had very good consistency in the taste and was garnished with what seemed to be brown sugar. I have never had these combinations but it was very nice on the palate. My meal consisted of the 8 ounce filet mignon with mashed potatoes. Instructions given to the waiter were for the steak to be cooked medium rare and Pittsburgh'd. Although the waiter was not familiar with the terminology, he did relay it to the chef who did prepare the steak as directed. The steak was garnished with shiitake mushrooms and a brown glaze sauce. Overall the meal was very delicious.  A dessert menu was offered, but none was ordered. Although after dinner wines were on the menu, none were offered. Overall experience was a delightful one and total cost for lunch was around the $55 range for one person. I would visit this place again.",

The food is delicious, the service attentive, the atmosphere pleasant and the overall experience is a good value. I ordered the fish sandwich and was extremely pleased. The fish was prepared in a light batter and was about twice the size of the bun on which it was served. Moreover, it was quite thick making the portion a very substantial and filling main course in the meal.  The Fish Tacos my wife ordered featured plenty of fresh fish, nicely grilled rather than battered or fried, and like my fish sandwich, made for a good meal experience.",

He had very specific parameters within which to work: 1) the restaurant had to be close to UNLV because I had to get back that night for a rehearsal, 2) the restaurant had to have good yelp reviews!, and 3) the restaurant HAD to have chocolate cake on the dessert menu (because I like cake and because it's my birthday!).  He found Tommy Bahama's, made a reservation just in case, and picked me up at the uni.    What a lovely dinner!  The food was FANTASTIC.  Service was almost flawless; waitstaff forgot to bring our grilled artichoke appetizer before our main dishes.....BUT they comped the appetizer to make up for that oversight and gave me 3 free desserts because it was my birthday!    Our dinner began with the bread basket and honey/cinnamon/garlic butter.  Warm, soft, crusty bread with sweet butter.  What's not to like?  The grilled artichoke was decadent and delicious.  For our mains, we both ordered fish: I had the the seared ahi tuna (YUM) and hubby had the black cod (again, YUM).  Portions were not huge; rather, they were \"normal\" sized and allowed us the stomach space to have a multi-course meal.  Desserts were perfect.  The chocolate cake was rich and velvety and indulgent, the key lime pie featured fabulous bright flavours that contrasted with the graham crust, and the pina colada cake was just plain good.  The waitstaff even sang \"Happy Birthday\" to me whilst bringing out my desserts.  How cute!  All in all, I never would have thought that a retail clothing store would house a hidden dining gem.  Would I come again?  Most definitely.  Thanks for a GREAT birthday meal, Tommy!  :)",

    "text": "I've been to the restaurant a few times, years ago, and never had an issue. The wait staff is generally friendly and the food displaying a good spectrum of flavor. For Date Night, my wife decided to hit them up. The restaurant was dead as it was happy hour so what business there was had migrated to the Bar area with the live (but mellow) music. The Happy Hour menu is discounted, in some cases by five or six bucks, but pretty limited and with the appetizers being very scaled down versions (getting what you pay for).  Luckily, the few drinks offered are still very good. Try the \"Crazy Cuban\" and the \"Coconut Cloud\" for a sweet, boozy flavor profile! The portion sizes still waver between high-end snooty and fairly worth it though the food itself is hardly lacking. Though they no longer carry \"Blackbeard's pudding\", the dessert offerings are still quite delicious. If you're looking for something a little different with a relaxed atmosphere (You're already in Town Square so your wallet is expecting a dent or two), this fills that niche.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week meal #3 occurred at Mr Bahama's joint. I wanted to do a work lunch and Town Square is close to the office. Plus, I've always been curious to try their key lime pie. My coworker hails it as the best he's ever had.  With the weather being beautiful out, we sat at a perfectly shaded outdoor patio table and wasted no time in ordering our RW items. My selections were:  * World Famous Coconut Shrimp, Papaya-Mango Chutney, Asian Slaw * Grilled Chicken & Mango Salad, Toasted Almonds & Macadamia Nuts, Dried Cranberries, Feta, Pepitas, Vine-Ripe Tomatoes, Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette * Key Lime Pie, Graham Cracker Crust, White Chocolate Mousse  Not knowing much about the brand, I wasn't sure what kind of restaurant Tommy Bahama is supposed to be. Clearly, the store and restaurant have that tropical kind of feel. Everything I sampled today embodied that atmosphere. The coconut shrimp was perfectly cooked and the slaw and the salad tasted fresh and refreshing. I could totally imagine myself eating those items on a tropical island beach. The chicken could have been more tender and succulent, but the salad more than made up for that shortcoming. As for the key lime pie, it was indeed excellent. The texture was impeccably creamy and it wasn't overly sweet.  Add in the extremely fast and friendly service and I see no reason why I shouldn't give them five stars.",

We were met by a very friendly waiter who took our drink order and gave some healthy suggestions for my wooden leg. We started with the coconut shrimp (excellent flavor and not overly fried) and the crab bisque. Both are recommended and perfect servings. The bisque warmed me up while not being overly creamy. We finished with the Sanibel chicken, short rib dish and the blackened fish tacos. Each dish had a world of flavors and I would order each again and that's not the alcohol talking. Great location in town square great staff. Overall a pleasant meal and will return. Great for families too.",

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR (4-7pm) REVIEW:  Man..their main courses are of wwwaaayyy better quality than their happy hour. Now, I'm a big fan of Brio's happy hour so when participating on a happy hour I expect the same quality.   I ordered the blackened fish tacos for $6.00 and a slice of my faovrite Pina Colada cake for $6.00. Not only was the fish dry, but the size of the fish in the taco was about the size of my pinky finger. The seasoning was of a likeable taste, but it was drowning under a big mound of coleslaw. Definitely not a happy hour item I would recommend.  The macadamia nut goat cheese for $5.00 was pretty good. It is a small portion (like a small scoop portion) garnished with a sweet mango salsa. It was had a nice sweet flavor with a good macadamia crunch!   I also tried the lobster bisque which was good too. A good cream density with a great sweet bisque flavor. It had very subtle pieces of lobster in their, but it was still a good eat!   The desserts as usual are on point! As always I chose the Pina Colada cake which is my favorite cake of all time. It never fails. However, I did come across a new infatuation with the pineapple creme bruelee. So sue me for being super overly excited that it's serve in a pineapple dish! Don't start worrying that maybe with the nice presentation that they may hold out on the pineapple chunks. The creme brulee has two layers of pineapple in it, and then the actual brulee on top of it. Oh it was such a good combination. Who knew that pineapple and creme brulee would taste so good!  If the happy hour doesn't improve in quality, I do hope they bring back their 3 course menu special. (Hint. Hint. Tommy!)",

I think it was $12.99 and included a side of fruit and either a simple salad or cup of soup. Not cheap, but worth every dollar. Everyone knows how hard it is to find a decent veggie burger that's not just a frozen patty.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA#8M4591pmudsTKD6IhLwd-A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/uUEK...</a>  The service was meh. He redeemed himself towards the end, but gosh it was awkward when our server took our food orders and then messed up the drinks. Maybe he had a hangover or a hemorrhoid flare-up. Got me.   FYI- If you carry a purse bring a purse hook. The chairs are rounded at the top so you cannot hang your purse. Regretfully I had to put my nice purse on the ground because I didn't want to eat with it on my lap. This was annoying.   FYI Take Two- Be careful of the palm tree outside the door. I swear it jumped out and stabbed my boob when no one was looking. Glad it wasn't my eye, but still not the kind of physical relationship I want to have with a palm tree. Like ever.

Our server, Domonique, was very knowledgeable about the menu, she made a few recommendations that worked out very well. The first recommendation was for a spiced sangria that was so delicious.  Dominique was genuinely friendly and her service timing was excellent.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  There was live music in the lounge that we really enjoyed listening to during our meal.    All in all, Tommy Bahama did a great job. Full Disclosure: the regional manager reached out to me about my previous experience.  I am impressed that Patrick cared about the issues and pledged to provide some training for the staff.

My favorite is the filet mignon and their cauliflower potato mash. It has a red wine mushroom reduction sauce so it makes the filet even more flavorful.

    "text": "Located in Town Square, this is a really nice restaurant.... not super fancy or pretentious yet not just a bar or hamburger joint.  It's the perfect happy medium of nice and upscale casual.  LOVE, LOVE their coconut shrimp.  Not bready at all.  Big juicy shrimp, butterflyed and coated with coconut shreds... lightly fried ....NOT greasy at all.  They have a number of grea fish entrees so if you would like a nice fish dinner... head here.  (However, it's NOT cheap... so plan on paying a few bucks.)  Ambiance is tropically but not \"beachy\"... it feels like a nice resort. They do have patio seating so if it's nice outside definitely try to get an outside seat so you can people watch.  Also, if you are looking for a place to host a party like birthday, retirement, baby shower, bridal shower, etc.... ask about their back room.  It's behind the bar and totally private.  TB does a really nice job with private parties so I recommend it.  (Just attended a baby shower there and it was beautiful!)  Desserts.... ALL of their desserts are decadent.  I particularly like their coconut-pineapple cake.... light and heavenly ...  am hoping it doesn't stay on the hips too long.",

The lollipop chicken had a good spice to them. It was delicious. My friend and I also ordered the poke and the pork pulled quesadilla. All of it was delicious. We sat in the bar area where the booths are. Our server/bartender Chris, was awesome. He was attentive and nice. I asked him what he suggested and he said the lollipop chicken and the poke. The poke was tuna with avocado with a side of chips (wonton skins fried). It's great because the last time I was here, chris made some awesome drinks. I love how the service is consistent and always warm! Will definitely be back to bring more friends.",

I haven't reviewed my past experiences, and it had been quite some time between the time I had tried it for lunch and my most recent experience, so this review is solely based on happy hour.  Good wine, delicious poke (I usually don't even like poke).  My friend ordered a cheese dip (or maybe I did?)  I thought it was hummus but super tasty!  The plantain chips were super yummy as well!    Service was good, maybe a little too attentive.  Overall, I love the atmosphere.  It is very relaxing and I [almost] feel like I'm on vacation (until I keep checking my watch to see what time I have to go get my daughter from Artsy Nannies!",

Regardless....the clothing line is by all means for individuals well into the 40s+.  Although it's the not the clothing line I am reviewing, but felt it was necessary to share.    From Scottsdale to Maui and now my experience in Las Vegas, I have to say it is a chain that has yet to disappoint.  The service has always been top notch,  the food is fantastic and the prices are on the edge of being overpriced, but the price point works for me.    Portion sizes are usually enough to share so getting a couple apps, an entree which allows drinking during and dessert at the end has been the way I usually do it.  Do not think they are oversized because they are not.  Each entree is sized to be filling....I'm just saying that the appetizers are too good to not order more than one.  Which ones do I recommend?  All of them....seriously.    We were on the patio at night and wasn't crazy about the in ground spot lights that was kind of blinding at times....nice for ambiance, but wasn't a fan at my table.  The bar looked like a good place to come if you are looking to have a spot to attend regularly.  The right size and the right mix of men and women....",

The friendly hostess greeted us and advised us that happy hour was inside in the bar area or on the patio outside. We opted for the bar inside. We sat at a booth that had pillows, it was very comfortable. I ordered the fish tacos and my friend ordered the sliders. We enjoyed our happy hour meals the pricing for the meal at that time is 8$ or less. We didn't try drinks we wanted to stay hydrated and drink water. Our server kept filling our glasses with water. Our server was courteous and brought or orders quickly. There was also live music in the corner which we enjoyed. The music volume was just right. Not too loud or too soft and the musician was excellent. I felt very relaxed. We really enjoyed ourselves",

It does not seem like you are in Vegas anymore -- horse and carriage rides, a train for the kids, a lawn for people to gather on, and for us -- a place to eat outside to watch all of this by.   The food at Tommy's was as good as ever and the only thing missing was the great entertainment of the place in Naples FL. They did have something going on inside but the tables outside we just too inviting to opt for the music instead of the outdoor space. The finishing touch would be to have the same kind of layout as Naples but alas it does not.  The service was outstanding and for the first night in town it was a great way to unwind, enjoy the food, and enjoy the sights without all of the craziness of the strip.",

I visited the one in the Palm Spring/Palm Desert area in California once while visiting good friends who live there and loved it. So, I had to come here for lunch one day and made the stop.  I loved the beachy, cozy feel of this place. It was pretty busy during a midweek day for lunch, which is a good sign. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich. Loaded with great flavor! I would have eaten the entire thing if I didn't need to lose a few pounds! :) The Jerk Yucca Fries on the side were just Yuck-A, in my opinion. Definitely an acquired taste, so I gladly gave them to a friend I was having lunch with and she enjoyed them. Let's not waste!   I will be back to this location to try other things on the menu and will insist that we have more than just drinks the next time I am at the Palm Springs/Palm Desert location when I am visiting my friends. Kudos to the establishment!",

Took time to explain the menu to us and even brought a complementary first course since it was our first time there.   We had tuna tacos for an appetizer and they were amazing! Must get them!

    "text": "Saw a sign last time we were in advertising a \"Chef's Table\" night, so we decided to try it out this week.  First the servers, and chefs were awesome!       Food wise,        We started with a Scallop Appetizer with lobster succotash, Corn, and edible flowers.  This was insanely good, and really really beautiful.  I would order this if it was on the menu.         Next course was a Crab and Shrimp Salad with citrus sesame dressing.  This had tomatoes, avocados, shaved asparagus, and HONEYDEW.   I actually thought it was apples instead, But either way, EVERYTHING on this dish played an amazing part.  The sesame was perfect, the creamy avocados, the shrimp cooked just right and the right size, and the honeydew added a perfect sweet bite to balance it all.  It was amazing.     Entre Course was a Filet Oscar.  This was my least favorite item.  The quality of the filet seemed lower quality, and mine was overcooked.  My wife's was cooked better, and she enjoyed it slightly more.  I have had better Demi Glaze. and Bearnaise.      Dessert.  This was not great.  There was pineapple that was too hard to cut without a knife(and we didn't have knives for this course). and the tarts were overcooked(Hard) and not real flavorful.  I am guessing that none of the chefs focus on pastry.  I would recommend instead of doing 4 items mediocre, to focus on one GREAT tart, maybe a chocolate tart with raspberry sauce and some fresh quality RUM macerated fruit(Sticking with the theme!).  But just do this one item perfect!  Especially since you leave people with this last taste, it needs to shine as good, if not better than the rest of the meal.  Food-wise, My Biggest criticism is that every bite of crab I had all night, which was on the first 3 items, had shell in it, and the steak being lower quality meat.  I personally would have been happier to pay $20 more and had slightly higher quality ingredients for these few items.  Drinks- First, they start you with a Rum Drink that was awesome.. even if you don't buy any drink pairings, this is included in your meal and was really great.  Then they pair either wine or Rum drinks to your meal.  I got Rum and it was well worth it.  I liked some, didn't like other, but it was matched well and I enjoyed that aspect of the meal.  Value-I felt this meal was excellent value.  I do think I'd pay more for slightly better, but understand why some people would be turned off to pay more, so I understand there is a marketing spin there.   Then I leave it with the people.  We met some great people and had some excellent conversation all night and till we essentially got booted out, but it was the cherry on top.  Really enjoyed our time and cannot wait to do it again!",

They have a nice selection of women's/men's clothing and some unique gift items (Tommy Bahama logo stuff, beer glasses, flasks, etc) You can also find candles, lotion, scents, etc.   There always seems to be some promo going on too. I purchased a $20 gift card for $5 for a charity promo and received a postcard from the store in the mail reminding me to use the gift card! Nice touch.  I also receive discount cards in the mail a few times a year for retail purchases.  My fave thing about the store is the yummy pina colada mini cakes & iced tea you can enjoy while shopping!",

Our server was friendly and kept track of us with refilling our water and soda before we even asked. He even made recommendations on drinks and foods. We share with him it was our first time and he was happy to walk us through the menu and specials.  I rested the Vegetable Seasonal Plate which was amazing. I felt so healthy after eating it. And my partner ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with French fries. Wow taste great and reasonably priced relative to the other restaurants nearby. We are locals and will definitely go there again.",

I ordered seasonal scallops with arugula and pumpkin mash. Last two gave such a nice balance in flavor offsetting the sweetness and zest. Scallops were tender and juicy. I also had lobster bisque: it was very tasty. I was concerned it would be too salty as most of places offering it have the same issue across, I noticed. But this time around, the bisque was perfect. Mojitos - classic and pineapple - had something missing to my liking. They were still good, just not my fav. My friend had filet mignon, and enjoyed his dish a lot. I definitely recommend the place.",

Anyway Mo totally turned this into a memorable experience so if you're heading to Tommy Bahama during lunch time ask for Mo he's awesome :) he didn't make us feel rushed and aligned and related while making awesome food recommendations and being friendly and genuine ...  Their seasonal menu was out and Mo showcased the different items that could be tasty .. My Mom and I could not decide so we shared one 702 Tenderloin burger meal and one Cuban Sandwich..  While waiting they brought out a little complimentary bite of seafood ceviche that was delicious   The 702  tenderloin burger is like this ciabatta bacon jam burger which was cooked medium well since it's filet the meat was totally juicy and they make the burgers fresh and I was impressed with the bacon jam was yummy not overpowering .. the garlic fries were delicious too   The Cuban came out and I admit usually I only go with that if my Mom is around cause she's so picky but honestly this was one that tasted fresh and authentic and the little potato fry things it comes with I don't know the name were delicious and the food filled us up so much ...  I plan to come back for dessert but we went home with Togo boxes ... this is not a cheap place but considering the service we received for the quality of food I definitely feel it's worth checking out if you're looking for a comfy place to feel like you're taking a trip with quality food while at town square ..",

    "text": "Our flight came in late, it took forever to get our luggage and rental car... by 3pm, we were hungry and ready to chow down. We Yelped dog friendly restaurant with minimum 4 star rating and near the Vegas airport and Yelp directed us hete. The receptionist and waitress were friendly and personable and that's a good first impression. Since we've never been to a Tommy Bahamas restaurant, we asked our waitess what she recommended. Even though she did mention that the appetizer and salad could be a meal in itself (warning to us ), we ordered all her recommendations because we were ready to chow at 3pm for lunch. We started with their fillet mignon flatbread (excellent suggestion) appetizer, lump crab and avocado salad (perfect, love the light dressing) and finished with the blacken fish tacos. We couldn't finish all the food and would have love dessert, but our belts were popping. We will come here again on our next trip and will make sure I leave room for the key lime pie. Our waitress's friendly and personable demeanor made it a 5 star experience. She was very attentive but not overbearing. Being a dog friendly restaurant a big plus.",

Sometimes they have live music in the bar area.  The food is always good and very consistent. My staple food items are the jerk chicken lollipops and the fish tacos. Dined here yesterday with a group of friends and they had a mojito Monday menu. Mojitos for $6 - awesome deal. I love the pineapple jalapeno one!",

Crispy Shitake mushroom and onions. And toasted buttery Brioche Bun. My gosh, my mouth is watering with this review.   The fries are top notch also. My big mistake was eating too much bread at the beginning of the meal. By coincidence, we stumbled upon a side of fried plantains that was divine. Similarly to the Brazilian steak houses, the plantains is cleansing to the palate but also delicious as a desert.   Great Island ambiance and service, Tommy's my new favorite place to grab a burger before a movie.",

I saw the menu beforehand to try and prepare my choice but once we got there and ordered some appetizers it was difficult. Everything looked so good! I didn't order the appetizers so I'm not sure exactly what they were called but they were coconut shrimp, some sort of chicken drumstick, a quesadilla, and a flatbread with pear and cheese. All of them were amazing but the coconut shrimp was the clear winner. I ordered the seared ahi with succotash and my husband ordered the fish and chips. The crust on the ahi was chili and brown sugar which was amazing and I loved the veggies. He loved the fish but the \"chips\" left something to be desired. For dessert I ordered the pineapple creme brulee and he ordered a chocolate tart. Both were amazing but the chocolate one was so rich we had to bring it home for the next day. I will definitely go back!",

A warm complimentary bread basket is brought to the table.  The honey cinnamon butter is great.  I could eat that all day long with that bread.  But I decided to order an actual meal.  The blackened fish tacos were delicious! The fish had a great seasoning. It's filled with tomato relish, chipotle aioli, lime sour cream and Asian slaw.  So filling and so worth it.    When they bring over the dessert sample tray, it's hard to say no.  We split the pina colada cake.  You can order the half slice or full slice.  The half slice was plenty to share.  The vanilla cake had layers of pineapple, white chocolate mousse and toasted coconut.  I loved every bite.  Next time I need to try their pineapple Creme brulee.  It looked so tasty.    Since it's easy to find in Town Square, I'm sure I will be dining here again.",

Then I got the Blackened fish tacos, one of my favorites at Tommy Bahamas. We got 3 tacos and on the side we got plantains with a pineapple dipping sauce with crusted coconut shavings! Wow! Then our 3rd course was a sampler of dessert chocolate cake, coconut cake and lemon meringue... Yummy! Ok so I am a big fan of Tommy Bahamas I have never been disappointed on anything that I've ordered there.  Oh and my drink at Tommy Bahama is a Mai Tai also a must try.  After all this knowing that I had a great lunch for restaurant week also felt good Tommy Bahama will be donating to three square!",

Normal menu items are pricey, but if you stop by for happy hour you can get a good amount of food and drinks for a good deal. I am local and going out for drinks regularly can add up. I prefer to go to places with a good atmosphere and deals.The coconut shrimp and pork quesadillas were my favorite. The shrimp is delicious, but you only get 3 shrimp for $8! I have been obsessed with Whiskey Smash's lately so I decided to ask if it was possible to make. Julian made me a Whiskey smash with blueberries and it was really tasty!

I've purchased clothing from here in the past and some of the clothing is great quality. I love the swimsuits! My husband gets a lot of wears out of his stuff and I notice that some of his shirts pill and come apart after a lot of washes and wears in a shorter period of time. Maybe he's too rough on his clothing but so many of his shirts have pulls and loose threads. I do not expect this from such pricey apparel.   The customer service here is good. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. Sometimes a little too much so. I'm the type who likes to browse without being bothered. A simple, \"let me know if I can help with anything,\" and then walk away is completely my style. The \"what can I help you find, what are you shopping for, blah blah\" approach is too much for me.   This store just makes me think of vacation every time I walk in, and that puts a smile on my face!!",

I was somewhat surprised to see that Tommy Bahama - which I thought to be a retail store - had a bar/restaurant there, but as it was a Friday night and waiting times were pronounced at other restaurants, thought I'd give it a go.  And I was very pleased I did :-)  The food - ironically for a venue in the middle of a desert! - is seafood focused, was well thought out, well presented and tasty.  And the service was good.  So I'd mark this as 4* / commended (which is about as good as it gets for a chain restaurant - I have to declare my personal prejudices make it unlikely I will ever give 5* to something that is a Cookie Cutter artefact).",

We were exploring the Town Square areas and decided to try the Tommy Bahama Restaurant for a late lunch, best decision of the day.  We have since had lunch and dinner there and have been very pleased with each visit.  I'm not a restaurant judge by any means but there are a few things I look for and a few things that will bring me back, quality of food, taste, presentation and service.  We have found this restaurant to be exceptional in all.  Meats have been tender, vegetables fresh, food seasoned but not to the point of covering up the True taste of the dish.  I can't say enough about the service, Dominique was the manager on duty during our first visit and made us feel welcome and special, what an asset to the restaurant.  Our server was Carrie, very friendly, and very attentive to making sure our lunch was a 5-star experience.  Great job, we will be back.",

Everything was superb and yummy. Despite my allergies to some of the things in the dishes we ordered, I would do it all over again.

I can forgive a very long wait for the meal, especially when the assistant manager comes to your table and apologizes, telling us to save room for desert cause it was going to be on her.  After the long wait the LAST thing we expected was my 4 yr olds chicken fingers to be raw in the middle.  The most frustrating part was the apparent indifference the server showed other than to take our meal, and not even bother to ask if maybe she might want something else or a fully cooked plate.  Then when the check comes only one desert was comped along with a $8 chicken refund.  Called for the manager who did adjust the rest of the deserts off and said \"I made some other adjustments there too\" as he apologized.  Review of the bill shows only desert and chicken comped no \"other\" adjustments.  Very disappointed to have our Mothers Day dinner turn out so horrifying!  I mean come on RAW CHICKEN!!",

When we finally got up to leave some of the employees said bye thank you.  Worst service ever.",

For dinner I had a chicken cesar salad and my wife has the Crab stuffed shrimp. It was the best cesar I have ever had by far! The server Dominique suggested it would be best blackened and she was right. My wife enjoyed the shrimp immensely.  The rice was a little chewy but as soon as we told our server it was remedied quickly and the manager even gave us a free dessert or drink coupon for next time. We weren't even complaining we just wanted a replacement rice dish. The Sangria was delicious and really hit the spot. It was a great meal and we will be back for sure!",

The manager came by and gave us some recommendations and we were all happy with the options we chose.  The appetizer of ahi poke was delicious, as were the coconut shrimp.  The grilled chicken and mango salad was excellent.  Perfect combo of fresh and light with a nice grilled chicken breast.  The filet and the fish tacos were very good also.   A great, refreshing drink option was the rum with ginger beer.  A little sweet but I wanted another.  I will be a regular with the drink selections and the great food.  I'm ready to go back now!",

My fiance was really excited to take me to Tommy's for HH, because he had went with his friends and he raved about their excellent martinis. I LOVE martinis, so I was excited too. We decided to stop by for HH, the bar was packed. We decided to come back after walking around. We were just in luck, there were 2 seats open at the bar. The bar was clearing out as HH had just ended, but we didn't mind, because I JUST had to try this martini. We sat there for about 10 minutes and finally a bartender came up to us and we asked for their drink menu. As I had stated before the bar was emptying out and by that time the bar was only half full. There were seats next to us that were now empty. One guy came and sat in the seat next to us. The bartender gave him a drink menu right away. Another 10 minutes passed and no one has come by and asked if we liked to order anything. (It didn't seem like they were too busy as the bartenders were chatting with people and to each other). The guy next to us had already gotten his drink like 5 minutes ago. We left shortly after that. There was no reason why were ignored at the bar for 20  something minutes, we were sitting right in front and it was just ridiculous how we were being ignored. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in their lack of service and I won't be coming here anytime soon. I definitely don't recommend this place to anyone.",

He went above and beyond my expectations as a server. Great personality, Great service. Very attentive and accommodating to my dietary needs. 5 Stars just for service seriously.   Food was great too. I had Chicken Breast with broccolini. It was cooked to perfection. It was so tender & juicy. A nice change from my dried out home cooked chicken, lol   Others at the table ordered Fish & Chips, Bacon Burger, Steak Salad. All meals were excellent.   I'd definitely recommend Tommy Bahamas!",

Out of the 3 dishes, I picked he suggested the Fish and Chips with regular fries was the most popular.  I went with the Fish and Chips with the regular fries.  The fish was perfectly cooked, still tender on the inside, flaky.  The fries was a great suggestion.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the tartar sauce.  It was quite bland for my liking.

Our sandwiches came out in a timely manner and when they did we didn't even pause to chat because we were too busy enjoying every bite.  Doug came out with a whole tray of their desserts they have available and believe me there was no way you could say no! Everything on that tray looked fresh and delicious! They definitely know what they are doing! We chose the coconut cake! By far the one of the best places to enjoy yourself. Shout out to the chef Agustine!!!

That said, it's a great place to enjoy upscale casual dining with a tropical flair... it's especially enjoyable if you dine outside (if not too hot) or close to the passage-way to/from the outdoor dining area.  We shared the Caesar salad and fried plantains... must've been a special, as they are not on the menu.  The roasted pork sliders and grilled chicken breast sandwich completed our meal.  The food was well prepared and, as expected, quite delicious!!!  The great thing is that Town Square is a relatively short drive to enjoy the tropical ambiance, rather than a seven-hour flight... though the sea breeze would be welcome.",

Sayyyy what? I ask for butter for the rolls which i didnt get, the server refilled my soda water with regular water, she bumped on our table a few times while serving and served me an old decaf coffee.

I always thought Tommy Bahama was just a clothing store so....you could imagine my skepticism walking into the restaurant. As somebody who grew up in Hawaii, I'm also not particularly impressed by tropical themed places. Once the experience got going though..I have to admit that it was overall pretty nice. The service was very friendly and the overall atmosphere was relaxing.    World Famous Coconut Shrimp - 3/5; nice taste with a mild sweetness and crunch to the texture, but not really worth $11.5 for 4 shrimp imo  Cilantro & Ginger Crusted Mahi Mahi - 1.5/5; this was a mistake. We had wanted to be adventurous but none of the flavors really worked together. It was a bit too salty and a bit...astringent? Definitely could not eat too much of it without refreshing the palate with something else. Furikake rice cake didn't really have the crisp of flavor I was hoping for either. Presentation was nice though and the fish was well cooked.    Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken - 4/5; a bit of a pleasant surprise. I never really order chicken at restaurants because I cook so much of it at home, but the preparation seemed interesting and the server recommended it so I took the leap. An overall creamy dish, but still decently balanced. Enjoyed the herb cheese and the red pepper cream sauce, just a well composed dish. The opposite of the mahi mahi. The mash was also quite nice.  Mai Tai - 4/5; nicely fruity and well balanced. Sweet but with a kick.  Bread - 3/5; free, warm and cute looking, but lacking all real flavor or character of its own. Nice to have, but didn't really add anything to the meal.  I think the dishes were solid enough overall, but the service and the atmosphere are really what made the experience better. Looking back at my food ratings now, I wonder why I enjoyed the experience as much as I did, which definitely tells me that they were able to bring something more to the table than just the food.",

Wait time was great as well. On first bite, the taste and flavor was light and great!  The Combination of sauteed veggies were just right!  The tropical ice tea was also delightful.  They really take care of their customers here and have nothing but positive things to say on my lunch of this day.  Cheers and happy fooding!",

We had a reservation for noon and we were quickly seated an a table by a window. The ambiance at Tommy Bahama is lovely, with a very airy and tropical vibe.   Service from Pascha was excellent. He was quick to great us and take our drink orders. Complimentary bread and butter was brought out while we looked over the menu.   I went with the $30 lunch menu, which consisted of:   Crab bisque - Absolutely delicious with nice chunks of crab. I would return for just this.   Macadamia crusted goat cheese - SO GOOD. I almost didn't want to share with Jamie. My favorite item of the lunch menu.   Grilled baby back ribs - Large serving of tender pork ribs with a very yummy sauce. I ended up taking most of the ribs to go to ensure I could order dessert. I really liked the mashed potatoes and slaw sides as well  Save room for dessert!! Only an additional $5 during Restaurant Week, there was no way I was going miss the key lime pie. So refreshing and the perfect amount of sweetness. I also tried a bit of Jamie's peanut butter pie which was so decadent and rich.   We typically do brunch during Restaurant Week and I am SO happy we decided to do lunch this year instead. I feel like we got a great deal for the items served, everything was really yummy and I would gladly return in the future.   Yelp Reviews 2018 31/100",

This mid-Dec evening, our party of three came for both happy hour AND dinner, and had a wonderful experience! We'll be back!  YELPY DETAILS you could Skip  On this cool, mid-Dec evening, our party of 3 came for the happy hour first in its spacious, stylish lounge with a classy bar. Although the bar counter was large, it was more than half full around 5. Our nice hostess placed us at a comfy corner table.   We ordered our rounds of red wine (Penfolds Rawson's Retreat Cabernet, $5; BR Cohn Retreat Cab Sauvingnon, $7). Both wines were smooth and tasty. For munchies, we shared several small plates (pull pork quesadilla, 3 per order;  $5; Angus sliders, 2 per order $6; Jerk Chicken Lollipops, $5). All of them were quite flavorful.This evening, they also had a young man (Joe) with a pleasant, mellow voice singing and playing his guiter! We all warmed up to him quickly by his nice performance!  - He even took requests from audience, and did an excellent rendition of \"On the Road Again\"!   At dinner time, the hostess led us to our table by the window facing the beautiful park with a gorgeous, gigantic Christmas Tree! Our sweet waitress, Joni, helped us select our entree: 2 Ribeye with a side of potatoes ($39@), and Crabmeat stuffed shrimps with a side of spinach, $30. The shrimps were crunch, fresh and delicious. The ribeye steak, medium rare was juicy, tender and full of flavor. My ribeye order, cooked to MEDIUM, was a bit too dry, though still tasty - my own mistake for ordering it MEDIUM! The potatoes and spinach were excellent.   Over dinner, we were entertained by the view of the beautiful Christmas Tree in the park with its lights changing colors over music, and occasionally peppered by falling (faux) snow flakes! What a wonderful holiday treat it was!  We were too stuffed to try their tempting deserts, but did enjoy a hot cup of coffee for good measure. The attentive service of Joni and her wait crew, and the tasty dishes...made our dinner another memorable experience! We'll be back for more, perhaps, even sample their deserts!  Dec 2013",

Guacamole is loaded with garlic powder but the pimento cheese is not bad!  Deep fried tomato... Average but interesting.   Stuffed shrimp with scallop... Not good, yikes.   Crab and avocado salad... Was that canned crab? Dry, loaded with feta cheese to look like there's more canned crab then actual.  Ribeye... Aiyayaya.  Pappardelle pasta...   Vegetarian Cobb salad... Arrived with bacon.   Party of four... $163... I'll stick to my usual restaurants and the next time I get curious and my friends ask me if the place is a clothing store I'll stick with that and keep walking.

    "text": "Second time here. First time was incredible -service, dinner, drinks- and it's really a shame I didn't write a review then to compare the experiences. Oh well.  This time around, things tanked. A friend and I came for \"Island Time,\" their spin on happy hour. Let me tell you, the service was waaaaay behind island time and that's saying something coming from a local Hawaii girl.  We were waited on almost immediately which was great, especially considering it was NOT busy. But after all our food and drinks came, NO ONE checked on us or cleared our empty dishes or refilled water. The guy who initially waited on us disappeared. I literally had to search for someone to get a refill of water. And even after that it took another 15-20 minutes for someone to check on us. Before the service took a dive, I was interested in ordering more drinks and getting dessert. But when you pay no attention to your customer, to the point you could walk out and the staff wouldn't even notice....something is wrong.  Such a shame because the food here isn't too shabby. Service needs quite a bit of work before I would consider coming here again. Island Time prices aren't enough to lure us back in.",

    "text": "I was so close to giving Tommy Bahama 5 stars, but I can't do it.  We had a friend invite us to lunch and recommended Tommy Bahama.  Neither my wife nor I had eaten there, so we gave it a shot.  Very glad we did.  We arrived at 11:30 and there were only a couple of tables.  Nearly an hour later the place was 75% full, and this was a Tuesday.  This is typically a good sign.      To start, I had the crab bisque.  This was textbook bisque to me.  Velvety smooth with the cream, and the sherry flavor came through.  It had crab throughout, even a couple of chunks.  A couple of grinds of black pepper and this was excellent.  I would definitely order this soup again.  I had the chicken sandwich with French fries, rather than the yucca fries it is usually served with.  This sandwich was enormous, I was surprised how large it was.  The chicken was grilled perfectly, they pulled it at just the right time so it retained its maximum juices.  It has lots of fried onions, which are always welcome, as well as jack cheese, garlic mayo, and a jerk sauce.  I could have used more sauce, as it provided a well needed kick.  The soft bun kept it all together.  The sandwich was fantastic, but the fries were not.  They were void of seasoning, and tasted like they have been sitting at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.  Some were nearly cold, and none were hot.  This is the only reason I can't give Tommy Bahama 5 stars.  The wife had the special, a grilled cheese sandwich with everything under the sun and tomato soup with some sort of chiles.  We can't recall, it may have been poblanos.  Whatever it was, it was good.  The grilled cheese had blue cheese, bacon, and some sort of jam.  It was on the requisite crispy bread and was fantastic when dipped in the soup, which had a bit of heat from the chiles.  This was a fantastic version of a classic (and overdone) dish, one I hope they add to the menu.  For dessert, we ordered the side dish of fried plantains.  This comes with a yogurt sauce with bits of pineapple that was fantastic.  It was a great way to end the meal, a dessert that was unique but not that sweet.  Like the rest of the meal, I would order this again.    Overall, very glad we hit up Tommy Bahama, and will do so again.",

    "text": "It's been a couple years of visits to Tommy Bahamas' restaurant that has solidified my admiration. I love its location (Town Square is just so convenient), the ambience, the sophisticated, yet casual decor, and most importantly, the food (and the drinks). I love planning lunches here with girlfriends, intimate dinners with my fiance, or happy hour after a day of shopping. It's always wonderful.  I haven't had a meal that I've disliked, but of course there are stand-out dishes. I really enjoyed the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus), Rustic Chicken Pasta (Whole Wheat Spaghettini, Grape Tomatoes, Spinach, Cippolinis, White Wine Broth), and Seared Ahi Tuna & Kale Salad (Lemongrass Crust, Edamame, Corn, Hearts of Palm, Mushrooms, Pine Nuts, Tahini Miso Dressing). I have enjoyed the other dishes as well, but these I would order again and again.   During happy hour, I really like the Blackened Fish Tacos (Tomato Relish, Chipotle Aioli, Lime Sour Cream, Asian Slaw) and Jerk Chicken Lollipops (Macadamia Nuts, Jerk Remoulade). The World Famous Coconut Shrimp (served with Papaya-Mango Chutney and Asian Slaw) make a tasty appetizer and their desserts are crazy good! My favorites are the Pina Colada Cake (Vanilla Cake, Myers Dark Rum, Diced Pineapple, White Chocolate Mousse,Toasted Coconut) and the Pineapple Creme Brulee (Tahitian Vanilla Bean, White Chocolate Mousse). Seriously make room for these desserts and you won't regret it!  I love the island-themed cocktails - they're potent while tasty. The Pineapple Plantation (Van Gogh Pineapple, Honey, Muddled Pineapple, Lemon) and their Classic Mojito (Cruzan Citrus, Cane Syrup, Mint, Hand-Pressed Lime, Soda) are great! They're also usually $11-12, but just $6-7 during Happy Hour!!  Overall, they have great seafood and wonderful flavors. The service has been great every time I've dined as well. Keep in the mind that Happy Hour (4-7pm daily with a good selection) is only offered at the bar, but there are tables surrounding it as well! They also take Open Table reservations for dining in.",

    "text": "Dropping my review down to a single star. Here's why:   Came here at my suggestion for a good friend's birthday dinner last week. Her salmon dinner was ridiculously under cooked. We sent it back and another was brought out, but this should've never happened, let alone on her birthday. It was never mentioned or offered to be refunded.   Tonight I dined with my children, and my daughter was halfway through her burger when I noticed it too was severely undercooked. We ordered a medium burger, and it was very RAW. I felt bad that I hadn't noticed it earlier, but again: it should've never been served this raw. My son ordered the same burger and it too was raw. Our waitress did remove one burger from our bill, but why not both? Both burgers were undercooked! She didn't even pretend to care. We had a horrible, neglected dinner. I guess we weren't worthy enough to offer the dessert tray to either. I didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I did leave a crappy one. Very disappointed, because I come here often and these back to back poor experiences just left me angry.   I don't know what the hell happened to this place. But two visits in one week and awful food is unacceptable. Where is the accountability in the kitchen?!?! Stop sending out under-cooked food!   Love the rum drinks here, but we won't be back. Just rotten.  :-(",

After a couple of circles around the place we decided to give up this time around and try again when the cast is gone and there is less of a crowd. Guess this is the long way of \"checking out.\"  Four stars because that many people with four and five stars can't all be wrong.",

My experience was not all that enjoyable; while nothing was horrible, nothing was great either. We went at about 6:30PM on a Friday night and to our surprise, there was no wait. The hostess took her time and was in no rush to seat us - but she was nice. Once seated, the waiter had the same 'no rush' attitude and took his time greeting us.  We finally placed our order (I ordered the Cuban Sandwich w/ fries and my girlfriend ordered the Gluten-Free scallops). I was very surprised at the low-price of the scallops and couldn't wrap my head around the reasoning - until they arrived. First of all, the food was delicious. The portion size of the scallop dish was very small (2 scallops on some sort of salad).   Our waiter spent very little time on us and it was very hard to get anything - and once the group of women arrived at the table next to us: that's all she wrote.  Overall - the food was delicious, but the serving sizes weren't great. Service was less than average. Environment was very noisy.   I probably won't be going back.",

    "text": "Who would have thought that a guy named Tommy, who made it cool to wear linen pants and tacky flower shirts, could whip up some fantastic fare and amazing cocktails.  Service:  5/5 stars.  Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the food runner was on point, professional and efficient.  You can tell that the company cares about quality service and hires and trains the right kind of people to work here.  Food: 4/5 stars.  Don't let that reduction of one star discourage you.  That's reserved for knock your socks off kind of quality. This place is damn near close.  I had the crab bisque as I always do if it's on the menu.  The bisque was very tasty and was paired well with their fresh baked loaf of bread.  I'd prefer a little more \"meat\" in there just to make me feel better about the purchase; otherwise it was really good.  My main entree was the blackened fish tacos.  High quality white fish spread amongst three heaping tacos.  The meal was delicious once I scraped off the majority of the lime sour cream which the chef was a little over zealous with.  If I choose this again...\"sauce on side\".  The arnold palmers were flowing like Niagara falls in this place...I'd no sooner take the last gulp and there was another placed in front of me.  Was someone hovering behind me with one in hand at all times? Nope, they were just that good at anticipating my needs.  All in all this place is strong 4 out of 5.  I've deducted one star for the small points above and the fact that this place is not for the faint of heart, price-wise.   A dinner for two can and was easily 150 bucks.  Not for everyday (for me at least) but definitely on the list of 'must try again' in the near future.",

    "text": "\"Wanna get some food from Tommy Bahama's?\"  \"Sure.. wait what??\"  Yea, Tommy Bahama's is not just a clothing store, they serve Hawaiian type food.  My friend ordered stuff to go for us since she had a visitor at her house:  Loki-Loki Tuna Poke: Tuna w/ capers soy and sesame oil served with guacamole and 6 strips of chips.  It was ok.  Good filler but not worth $16.50.   Little Cayman Lollipops: 6 drumettes grilled, smoked with a mango BBQ sauce glazed. Comes with a dipping sauce, but i had no idea what it was.  Very tasty treats.  My tongue was very please to meet these bad boys, but for $9.50 per an order.. Eek!   Saba Steak Salad: Marinated, char-grilled tenderloin medallions, grilled potatoes, roman tomatoes, shiitake chips, garlic aioli & tamarind vinaigrette.  Steak was really tender and satisfying.  The vinaigrette was quite addicting too.  My buddy ate two salad, Tahitian Tuna Salad ($17.50 )and I think the St. Croix Salad ($16.50).  It still amazed me how much this tiny girl can eat.  She was pretty quiet the whole time munching on her greens, so i guess that's a good thing.   Overall I was very astonished that the food came out positive for the most part, but it's just a little controversial since the price was a bit steep.  Service was wonderful though.  We ordered to go from the bartender and she was very easy going and helpful.  3.5",

    "text": "Before I get into my review, I just want to preface that this rating is for happy hour.  Happy hour is from 4-7p all day errrday, which is pretty convenient.  I ordered the smoked salmon, fish tacos, ahi poke, crab bisque soup, chick lollipop, and the crab cake.  I had the sangria and cantaloupe martini to drink.  The food was just ok.  I didn't fall in love with any of the dishes we had, and thought that it was still too pricey for what it was.  I can't imagine paying full price for any of those dishes.  The lollipop chicken was dry, sauce was ok, mango salad it came with was good. Ahi poke and smoked salmon dishes were ok, but I didn't like the chips they came with.  Plantain chips would've been a better choice to serve with.  I thought the fish tacos lacked seasoning, flavor, sauce;  all I tasted was the flour tortilla.  Crab cake had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much sweet chili sauce.  It over powered the crab cake, which was too salty anyway.  Lastly, the crab bisque!  Disgusting.  I tried this cause it seemed to be a favorite dish on yelp reviews.  It was really difficult for me to eat because they went wayyyyy to heavy on the cream.  I really felt like puking after.  I would not recommend this dish.  The drinks were ok.  Sangria wasn't really a sangria.  No fruit, just cheap red wine mixed with fruit juice and water I suppose.  Cantaloupe martini was good, but way to sweet.  I think they should've held back on some of the melon liqueur.  Probably would've tasted better if they used real cantaloupe juice.  Service was friendly, but slightly inattentive.  No big deal cause he had the whole bar to take care of, plus the tables.  Didn't bring us the bread in the beginning, but did offer it half way through the meal.  I told him i'd like some, but he never brought it.  Asked for it after our meal was done, cause I wanted to taste the apple butter.  Had to flag someone else down for our check.  Overall, I will probably not come back because I didn't care for the food we had.  I tried to sample as much as I could from the HH and appetizer list.  Based on what I had and the price, there are other restaurants in Vegas I'd rather spend my money on.  That's it.",

This all seemed very strange given the location and the reviews. We were seated on the patio and the weather was beautiful. Service was somewhat slow but eventually arrived. Drinks were OK. We requested 1800 tequila but they didn't have it. We shared a salad and it was excellent. We had to wait on bread as it was being baked and they ran out. It arrived after the meal was almost over.  My wife ordered the fillet and it was OK but cold. The side vegetable offerings are limited. I ordered the almond crusted snapper. After I ordered they came said that they were out of snapper and would substitute Barramundi. This was a strange substitute. The fish was subsequently delivered and was tasteless and cold. Service was glacially slow. Ultimately, we did not eat the entrees and we left. We were offered a coupon for free appetizer but we left it on the table. Now we know why the restaurant was empty on Friday night.",

    "text": "With burgers being such a polarizing topic, everyone seems to think they know they best around. So naturally everyone I know constantly recommends another place in town, half of which I dismiss because they just sound awful. Such is the case with Tommy Bahama when a contractor named David I'm working with in town mentioned it. Out of all the places people throw out there, a clothing store has not been one of them and instantly sounded awful. After much persuasion, and perhaps the offer of a free meal, I caved and went with him to check it out. Could a chain known for its clothes also sport a restaurant with a VBB-worthy burger?  The restaurant is located in Town Square which can be a pain to visit at times, but also offers great people watching in the right spots.  And Tommy's definitely has a great patio outside to do just that. The inside of the restaurant looks a lot like their clothing stores with muted colors, decorative ceiling fans and pendant lights with sea shells on them. There's also a decent sized bar which is a quick way to drop in and out for a bite even when they're busy.  I can't speak much to the menu based on my visit as David knew exactly what we were ordering and placed it right away. It is available online though, and has quite a few options. The burger selected for me was the Smokehouse Angus Burger: prime Angus, toasted brioche, roasted garlic aioli, sharp white cheddar, red onion and Nueske's bacon. Upon first bite I noticed instantly that the bun was great, almost challah-like. It was soft on the outside, grilled and crispy on the inside. The top bun had a sweet ketchup spread on it, the bottom had the garlic aioli. Both spreads were minimal and just enough for flavor without being overpowering or messy. The meat had great flavor and was cooked close to my medium-rare that was ordered. The onions were fresh and not overpowering, but I still took some off as to not hijack too much of the overall flavor. The star of this burger by far was the bacon; it was crunchy, thick and had terrific flavor.  The fries weren't awful; they had good flavor and weren't oily or stale as they have often been around town lately. I wished for a bit more, but they didn't detract from the meal as a few have. As a whole I was definitely impressed with this burger, I really wasn't expecting much coming into it and got way more than expected. And although I didn't pay for this meal (thanks David!), I would say that the $13.50 menu price might be a bit steep for this. I don't know if I would include it in my Vegas 'must have' list as this is still a bit of a chain, but if you're in Town Square and looking for a good burger you should definitely stop by.",

We decided to get drinks and a bite to eat:  Mai Tai: sweet and strong and full of pineapple. Perfect for cooling off in the Vegas heat.  Dark and Stormy: Made with Gosling's Black Seal Rum and Ginger Root Beer. It was strong, tart and refreshing. It's considered \"Bermuda's National Drink\". I had two.  Key Lime Pie: Delicious and silky with the slight sweetness and tart of key lime. The crust was a moist and crumbly graham cracker crust.   We'll be back for the lobster tacos.",

    "text": "Tommy Bahama at Town Square provided us with a really surprising and fun dining experience.  We were looking for somewhere new to eat and decided to give this place a try. The giant billboard featuring a mouth-watering slice of key lime pie had been calling me for well over a year now, so tonight was the night to finally make the short drive to Town Square.  Upon arrival at the restaurant I was immediately struck by how friendly the staff were. I didn't get the name of the girl who greeted us, but she was extremely welcoming and let us know that our server, appropriately named \"Tommy\", was excellent. She was certainly right. Tommy was friendly, sharp, congenial, accommodating - everything you want from a waiter. He gave us lots of good advice and engaged us in conversation about the food, ranging from the bread with honey-cinnamon butter, to the excellent lemonade we ordered. He really seemed to have a passion for the menu items and did a great job of at least appearing to delight in our enjoyment of them.  I ordered the Sanibel Stuffed Chicken and my wife got the Antigua Quesadillas appetizer and a variety of sides to share with me. We both loved our food and were particularly taken by one of the sides, the enormous basket of plantain chips, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and served with a black bean, charred corn salsa with lime sour cream.  Around halfway through our meal the idea of eating the key lime pie that had lured us there in the first place began to look like a bit of a pipe dream - but we were so happy we decided, what the heck. Two slices to go.  Overall our experience here was wonderful, particularly helped by the pleasant outdoor dining section and the lovely early April weather. My only minor criticism of the place is the lack of any real vegetarian \"main\" option for my wife. She was more than happy with what she had, but a little variety would call us back all the more often. That tiny gripe aside, Tommy Bahama was the complete dining experience for me and everything that is good about a meal out. We will be back.",

As president of our chapter I was charged with securing a venue for us. After getting the runaround, headcount minimums and various other nickel-and-dime tactics from half a dozen other Las Vegas restaurants, I was fortunate enough to be recommended to Tommy Bahama. Tommy is on top of his game! From Kaaren - who was the most accommodating and responsive event coordinator I have ever worked with - to Adam, Amanda, Jason and the rest of Tommy's front-line team, our hats are off! No one went thirsty throughout the evening - a very tall task to tackle when you're dealing with folks from Wisconsin! The food was superb, as was the setting. If you are looking for a place that is reasonably-priced to have a very nice event for 40-60 people, I don't think there is a better option in Las Vegas. Thank you again Tommy for a wonderful customer experience - you get a 10 on the Net Promoter Score from the Las Vegas Badgers!",

We had the fish tacos and the scallop sliders both were perfect.  We also has the crab bisque which was very salty.  Would not recommend you drink as a soup but it was fantastic as a dip for the bread.  In fact the bread and the butter here were both fantastic.   Service was great and kid friendly.  They have a kids menu with easy to digest food and a little drawing kit for kids to play with.   I recommend it!!",

If you close your eyes you just might think you were on an island somewhere, especially if you have enough of their mojitos, which was made perfectly.

I got the Kobe burger & he had their fish tacos. Here's what we were in store for...  -Kobe burger: sauteed mushrooms, garlic aioli, grilled onions on a brioche bun and yummy skinny fries on the side.  -Blackened fish tacos (3  to an order): basa fish, chipotle aioli, shredded lettuce, cilantro & pico de gallo. Came with a side of fried plantains in a creamy coconut sauce.  WOWWEEE!!! So we always share dishes when we go eat and we weren't short of impressed or felt jipped by the fairly expensive dishes we ordered. The tacos were a prefect blend of tanginess & juiciness. The white flakey fish was amazing & aioli and pico de gallo, refreshing.  My burger was perfection but a bit too rich for my tummy so I wasn't able to finish it.  I definitely got it to go though. This restaurant/clothing store beat my expectations and I'm always happy about that. If you are at Town Center doing some shopping stop by and get some grub here. You won't regret it. They also have a happy hour...I think from either 3 or 4pm to 7pm.",

Here's how the experience went down:  We walked in and the place reeked of pineapples, more than likely to set that tropical mood.  FYI: islands don't smell like pineapples, but whatever.  We were seated in a booth, which was nice, and our server took our drink orders right away.  We threw in some appetizers and 10 minutes went by before they come out luke warm.  The plantain chips, which I expected to be fresh from the fryer, were ice cold.  Oh well.  The food itself took 20 minutes to come out, which is way too long, even with refills of the bread basket.  By the time the food came out, I was full, but I tried it anyway.  The cuban is good, not great, and the other items my friends' bought: pork sandwich and jerk chicken were disgusting.  I don't eat things that look as if someone chewed it up and spat it out.  Presentation wasn't there, but it's not a 5 star restaurant.  All I ask for is good food, and the stuff they use in their sandwiches for the pork's bbq sauce and the jerk seasoning was too sweet and tasted very commercial.  Not for me, or them.  Overall, nice place to spend 12-15 bucks on a sandwich, but not worth the price tag.  I'll never eat here again, no matter how decent the appetizers were.",

Our friends and family come from all over so our guests decided that our celebration would take place in Las Vegas. What better choice than the Marriage Capital of the World. Everything else was easy once the destination was selected. We immediately knew we were going to Tommy Bahamas.  We have been Tommy Bahama fans (both restaurant and retail) for a number of years.  We have always found the food, drinks, atmosphere and service exceptional based on our experiences in Orlando, Palm Springs, Scottsdale, Myrtle Beach and Las Vegas.     Kaaren provided suggestions or assisted with coordinating a myriad of details including decorations, flowers, live music, menu, beverage and signature drinks, snacks, favours, and ensuring taxi services were available.  Finally our big day arrived.  We renewed our vows in the Bahama Room; adjourned to the Garden Room for champagne and hors d'oeuvres and then returned to the Bahama Room for dining and live music.  We could not have been more pleased with the success of the day.  Our guests attended from Bermuda, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Arizona and Nevada.  All of the guests commented on the wonderful venue and ambience.  We are already planning a return trip to Tommy Bahamas Las Vegas to celebrate our 26th anniversary, but on a much smaller scale.   We hope to visit, have a Dark and Stormy and enjoy a dining experience at each and every Tommy Bahama restaurant location as part of \"Living The Life\".  Our sincere thanks for a fabulous day.  Till next time,",

I saw the menu an wanted to leave the prices were a little high and the menu was kind of small.   We ordered the crab cakes calloway and the big island goat cheese w/ island flat bread.. First the crab cakes they were two about 2oz ea.. it was on an asian cole slaw which sat in a pool of sweet chile sauce and olive oil.           The slaw was good but the sweet chile sauce was way too sweet, the crab cakes were meaty not to much filler and were good.         The big island goat cheese with mac nuts and a sweet soy sauce glaze was pretty good but did not care for the island bread that came with it , more like a cracker.           We both ordered the cuban sandwich it came with fried yucca. The sandwich was very good . It was pressed nicely so it had a nice crispness to it. The ham and roast pork was a decent amount. Everything was nicely balanced. The fried yucca was intresting it had a crisp crust and a creamy texture in the middle not much flavor like a potato. I kinda got used to it ,wife did not like it.  Service was very good. I took a star away for pricing and a small menu.  I think bahama breeze is a better deal and they have  a very diverse menu,if your looking for carribbean flavor.",

I also ordered the sliders which were moist and delicious as well. My only complaint was that it took almost 30 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered...but we did get our drinks pretty quickly. In addition to the food they also had a gentleman with a guitar singing in the corner of the bar area. Live music, excellent ambiance, friendly service, reasonable prices.

    "text": "Tshirts and happy hours together!!!  Located in Town Square, this Business is one of those two tone or two ideas rolled into one. Retail and Restaurant rolled into one symbiotic relationship.  I'll start by saying Australia does have Tommy Bahamas, but to tell the truth you would never really know they were there. Most are located in very high volume tourist areas that locals never swing by. So my general experiences have been from this location.  Strolling through the retail section I would say that maybe some of the gear isn't in my age bracket just yet. That's not to say older fashion beach and boating wear isn't cool. \"Bow ties are cool\" so who am I to judge.  Now for the few happy hours that I been to here. Id like to say I was impressed with the menu and range they had. Sitting out on the patio we grabbed the sliders, seafood tacos And a Mai Tai.  All were great, the sliders had a great tasting  bun which I was informed was Hawaiian bread. The tacos had a slight spice kick to them with half decent Mai tai that to be honest didn't really hit the mark.  The service wasn't too bad, seating and the server both were prompt delivering dishes and clearing tables with smile. High chairs and a kids menu are also provided but the menu is full of deep fried stuff which I'm not a huge fan of..  Overall Drinks: 2-5 Food: 3-5 Service: 4-5 Back again: yeah maybe I'll stop by, but there is a few other places Id go to first in town square",

The communication back and forth (via email) was really great, I was able to customize our menu easily and bring in my own wedding cake. Everything was so easy and friendly. The food was amazing, all the guests were really impressed with the food and cocktails they ordered (especially the crab bisque soup!). To top it all off, the service was A++. They went above and beyond for everyone at the dinner. I can't say enough about my experience at Tommy Bahama, it was definitely the best and easiest part of my wedding day in Vegas.",

I had the crab bisque it was creamy and had big lumps of crab and had a great flavor. They also brought out fresh hot rolls with sweet butter, those were fantastic. I enjoyed the fish and yucca fries. The fish had a great crispy coating without greasy aftertaste. The staff was really attentive and friendly. To end the meal I had the key lime pie. I loved it with really good whipped cream. The staff gave me a postcard they said they will send out and pay the postage which was a really nice touch. The decoration in the restaurant is cute and islandy. I really enjoyed the mai Thai and I will come back here again even without a special deal on the food.",

Water cups not once refilled.   The food, exceptional. I only got one drink and one appetizer (won ton tuna tacos). The drink was amazing. The tacos were good but won-ton shells are probably not the best case for tacos- they break easy and the contents just spill everywhere. Smh.

Probably wouldn't order again if given the opportunity. The coconut shrimp on the other hand, were amazing! Extremely disappointing that there were only 3 for a $9 plate. Not easily shareable so I actually ordered another plate.   The service and atmosphere were fantastic. I'd definitely come again but I would say that they are overpriced.",

It just may be my favorite cake and I tried the key lime pie to be fair, but the cake is good. Anyways, enough about the cake. For appetizers I recommend the crab cakes and their World famous coconut shrimp. For my cocktail I had the mango Habanero Margarita and it is \"EXACTLY\" what it says! I definitely did not expect that punch of Habanero, but it's still a good cocktail if you desire some spice in your life. Overall the customer service is good and the environment is chill.

Coconut shrimp was perfect. Chicken was cooked great - moist and delicious. The cauliflower mash were a great potato alternative and you couldn't tell the difference.  Carrie on Sunday was amazing. So patients with our request.  Friendly and outgoing.  Joy on Tuesday was amazing. Super busy but all needs met and great sense of humor. Stopped to chat once things slowed down and really enjoyed her stories.  2 different personalities- both amazing in their own way.  PS. Kids will love the Mac n cheese. Gourmet cheese sauce on pasta.",

Of course a strong mojito helps also. Excellent service. Get there before 11:30 for a nice table near the window. This great value ends on the 28th. An Open Table reservation would not hurt. Has always been one of our favorites. NOTE: Could not resist so we went back again today with family and tried the other menu. Awesome. Just go.",

First, we were very disappointed that they did away with the Chicken Lollipops.  That is a big miss.  However they added a Sept appetizer special of Edamame.  Wow, that is a big hit with us.  Then we had Filet Mignon Flatbread & Coconut Shrimp.  And of course Mai Tais to drink.  Yuum, Yumm.  Highly recommended.",

Caribbean vibes going on here with great flavors and unique dishes.   Portions are huge.  Food was very tasty.  Waitress was overly friendly and borderline obnoxious but service good overall.  I really don't like the rewards program where you have to enter a credit card to get a $10 coupon...the only place I've seen this policy and won't be signing up because of it.  The restaurant even followed up by phone to see how the dinner was...nice touch...but a little overboard IMO.",

They have lots option for drinks at HH. For dinner, they are very busy all the time so it s better with a reservation. I like to seat outside when it s warm so it can be an observing spot to watch people. The Caesar salad is worth to try.",

Both seem to be a great value, with a large amount of food and several seafood options. Good spot to bring your pescatarian friend!  Caesar salad and chicken tortilla soups were solid, but the lollipop chicken and grilled artichoke apps were both very tasty with good dipping sauces. By the time we got our fish tacos, we were too full to eat them- trio of tacos with blackened fish (tialiapia?), on corn tortillas, served with plaintains and coconut cream.   Save room for dessert- their peanut butter pie is a solid version but the Pina Colada cake is light and fresh and creamy, perfect for these hot summer temperatures! Request Phil or Pasha as your server- both are personable, attentive, and attractive!",

Several waiters and waitresses touched our tables to make sure our drinks were full and we were constantly provided with complimentary bread and honey butter. My SO ordered the blackened fish tacos while I ordered a grilled shrimp ceasar salad, both pictured below. The salad wasn't exactly as I was expecting since it was a full lettuce leaf but it was great! The dressing was evenly proportioned and the shrimps were a very generous size. Not only was the salad great but the tacos were to die for. Although not pictured the tacos came in 3 with a side of plantains. The next time we come back I will surely be ordering all of this again!",

Yes both Kevin's! I appreciate the great service.  The cocktails were absurd. The coconut cloud is better than a pina colada. A martini and ohhh sooo good. The mai tai cocktails were also great for the pallet.  The happy hour has a good selection between beer, wine and signature cocktails as well as the food options. We went with the blackened fish tacos and the ahi poke. The tacos come with two and are descent sized. The ahi was served on a bed of avocado with crackers. They wouldn't be a full meal but definitely some great bar snacks.  We were also lucky to experience the live music. Two gentlemen played in the bar and did it well.  This tropical themed restaurant has a great vibe and the staff was outstanding! By far one of our favorite stops",

Tommy Bahamas Happy Hour runs from 5-7 during most of the year, but we found the Happy Hula Days sign, and noticed that it is 4-7 now.  This is great for us, since it gets dark much earlier in Las Vegas -at the beginning of the time zone- than it does in coastal California, so we feel like it is later! We rolled in the back door (closer to the parking lot) and slid into one of the comfortable booths lining the bar area.  They have live music at the Happy Hours, and the duo playing added to the lively ambience.  The choice of well drinks and appetizers is pretty standard at the Tommy Bahama bars, but we tried the new Cuban hot dog sandwich, the world-famous coconut shrimp and another new item, goat cheese with tasty tortilla-ish strips.  The sandwich is a bit spicy with delicious Foccaccio type bread.  The coconut shrimp are always sweet and the sauce adds a little spice.  The goat cheese was actually my favorite, smooth and creamy without that \"A sheep just walked through my mouth\" flavor it sometimes gets! A delightful well Margarita and all the food items arrived promptly from our friendly server, providing us with a delectable feast.  We relaxed and grooved to the music while we enjoyed the tropical tastes!",

The fish tacos are my absolute favorite but there are a number of other food selections for Aloha Hour like the hummus trio.  The staff are some of the best in the area.

We waited in the bar and had a beer before going in for dinner and there was live entertainment in the bar. For dinner, we had the salmon and steak, both well-prepared, and our server was professional and friendly as well. Also, the dessert selection was the best.

I was pleasantly surprised to find a totally different staff and fabulous service.  Our server, Anna, couldn't have been more energetic, helpful, efficient and eager to please.  Drinks and food were out reasonably quickly (but not too quick); no mistakes were made with the food; and when I asked for hot sauce, she had several options available and suggested I try a spicy aioli that she had the kitchen whip up just for me.  I had the fish tacos served with fried plantains again (oh how I wish there were more plantains!!) and couldn't have been more satisfied.  Well done, TB!!",

The sause that they used on crab cake dish is diffrent from the other restaurants. Its like the asian sweet chilli sauce and olive oil with a little bit lime juice. Icouldn't stop dip on the sauce. I also like ceasar salad. It's very good size for lunch. The server was very nice and cute. I always stop there when I go shopping with my girlfriend.",

It was kind of an oversight on the restaurant since there was a major event taking place in the middle of Town Square (right outside the restaurant) and there's apparently a rule about no competing events in the same spot. The 1PM show got moved to somewhere around 3PM or 4PM. Throughout the afternoon it was pretty hard to get any accurate info on the exact when and where of anything and where to wait, etc. Not even the band had the info to give us since the restaurant hadn't figured out all the kinks yet. We were all starving and got take out from inside the restaurant. The food was pretty good. We got a variety of items and everything tasted awesome. Once everything got going it was a bit more organized but still a bit confusing. I think the really great meal got a bit overshadowed by the unorganized event that we were all there for; I might give it another try.",

The huge chocolate cake was also very rich and tasty and well worth sharing but the pineapple creme burlee was to die for. Very creamy and tasty with the pineapple.

I have eaten in Scottsdale, Maui, Palm Desert and was looking forward to a \"leaving Las Vegas\" Mai tai.  We arrived just as they opened and sat outside in beautiful weather.  I started with a Mojito , rather than the Mai Tai and boy what a fine choice I made.  I never come to these for the food, rather I love the Island theme and Caribbean music, Steele drums etc.  But this time is was not just pleasantly surprised, it was delicious.  I had the Cobb salad and substituted shrimp for chicken and my bacon well done.  It was PERFECT!!!!!!  Double your vacation and make this your first stop in and your last stop on the way out.

At $20 a glass they would still make 140% profit on the bottle and you would leave with some dignity instead of feeling taken advantage of. but instead they shoot for 320% profit on the bottle and lost a customer who otherwise would have been back in a heartbeat. Different strategies for different people I guess",

Service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar (there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar).  Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights.",

My wife had the coconut shrimp appetizer for her main course.  (She is nuts for coconut) She said it was some of the best coconut shrimp she has ever had. I had the bacon burger which was delicious.  The service was just fine. The waiter seem to be busy else where in the back and would show up a few moments after I was started to wonder if he'd left.

Later in the evening, they even had a live performer who sang and played guitar.   We came for Happy Hour (which is from 4-7 pm) and ordered the Bahia Sangria, Mojito, Duo Dip of Chips, Sliders, Blackened Fish Tacos, and Pork Rib Entree. My sangria came out with a pretty flower and it was strong enough to do the job. The waitress told us that everything they serve is fresh and cooked in house - which was apparent when we saw tasted the food.  The Duo Dip of Chips are just chips with fresh guacamole and zesty cheese. I was surprised at how well the cheese came out! I never had that type before and that's certainly not the last time. The Sliders are the miniature versions of their real burgers and come with BBQ sauce, bacon, onion, tomato and lettuce. The Blackened Fish Tacos were amazing!! They gave us quite a bit of high quality fish! The Pork Rib entree gives you about 6 ribs with mashed potatoes and asian cole slaw. The ribs were cooked tenderly and the sauce was spot-on. I would recommend all of these items! The happy hour items were very affordable - about $5-8 each. The entrees are more expensive as expected, ranging around $18-30.   Since it was Valentine's Day weekend as well, they also offered a trio of desserts for $10 that included strawberry panna cotta, chocolate cake with oreos, and red velvet cake. The panna cotta was my least favorite - I think the strawberry made it more tart than I'm used to. I definitely over-indulged with the rest of the cakes though! :)   My waitress offered amazing service and was very friendly. The only downside about the whole night wasn't due to the food or even my own waitress but was because another waitress rudely refused to take a picture for us. I don't think I've met a waitress who has been so unwilling to help before. Other than that negative aspect, I highly recommend trying this place out for Happy Hour!",

The perfect weather did make such the difference. We had a table for 5 outside and it was perfect! The drink and menu options are great!  A small menu but a very good mix if things.  First round of drinks I had the sangria which the flower in it just gave it that little extra something to make you feel like you were on a tropical island somewhere...it's the little things!  2nd round was the basil martini which was delicious.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  I would have had more if I wasn't driving :)  Food was really good! My favorite was the macadamia goat cheese! Fish tacos and plantain chips were yummy too. I plan to go back and get the poke and the sliders, which others in my party said the sliders were really good, I was just too full! But always have room for dessert and when they brought out the dessert tray, had to try the creme brulee in the pineapple.  Not only was it pretty and tropical looking but was amazing!  Never had that mix, glad we did and will definitely get it again!  We scraped the bottom!  I wouldn't have minded sitting inside because the guitar player Justin is amazing! I didn't realize he played there but saw him one day when I was passing through the restaurant.  He happen to be the musician I got to play at my sisters wedding. I saw him at a friends wedding and had to book him.  So glad I know where I can catch him play!  Town Square has many great happy hour options! This is up there in the rankings for sure! Such a great deal for the food and drinks you are getting!  Service is great and the outdoor patio is awesome for those perfect weather Vegas evenings!",

Not a fan of honey butter on french rolls, but the waitress brought butter which I liked better. The drinks were refreshing. Our marinated and grilled artichokes were charred black. And not just grill marks. We brought this to the attention of the waitress. She said she would take it back if we didn't like it after trying it. But I believe the cook shouldn't have left this for us to decide. As an upscale establishment, it shouldn't have been served this way. We had other food that was good but unremarkable.",

Got the goat cheese appetizer, I didn't care for it due to some odd after taste. Hubby enjoyed & finished it. The complimentary bread & cinnamon butter was good. Crab bisque soup was good, very rich. Coconut shrimp appetizer was good too but not sure what's \"world famous\" about em. Hubby said the philly steak tacos were just ok as well. He only finished 2/3 which is rare for him. Overall I think it was ok not a bad experience and didn't think it was a waste of time or money but probably won't go out of my way to return.",

I will certainly update my post.  Looking forward to a great dinner experience. We ate at Tommy Bahama's  It's always a good idea to give a restaurant a second chance.  We returned to Tommy Bahama's in TS.  We started with Happy Hour in the bar.  Fast, friendly service.  Well organized and staffed appropriately.  We had perfectly prepared martinis. Bryan, a manager, spoke with us.  He is a friendly personable person. We were seated on time.  The hostess took note of my request, (My husband is deaf). To be seated in a quieter area of the restaurant. Not that this restaurant is extremely noisy.  We had a very friendly, experienced waitress, Joanie.  Our wine was delivered promptly, by Dominica.  I think Dominica might be a manager.  Dominica was friendly, and knowledgeable.  Our food was prepared to perfection, and served hot.  We loved our dining experience.  Everything couldn't have been better.",

There are 5-6 different foods choice on the happy hour menu, 5 different martinis and 5 different cocktails.  I had a a pineapple martini, and a taste of the ahi poke and the sliders. All if which were amazing.   The sliders came with the usual fixings, but if you're a tommy regular, they used to come with fried onion sting... Which is the way we ordered them! So much better.   Can't go wrong with this pit stop. It's nice because it's off the strip, and it's a little break from the hustle bustle of the strip grind. It is located in a little strip mall, so some good walking around after a full stomach.",

I would suggest this is a great place to go if you are a visitor in town. If you are a local, what a great place for some wonderful Tommy Bahamas shopping and a nice lunch!

    "text": "This restaurant has been part of my life's journey over the past decade. When I was single, I would have lunch at the bar. When I owned my own business, I hosted events there. When I got married, we had dinners with my in-laws there. And now as a mom, I take my kids to lunch there. There's not too many restaurants that can do that, and Tommy Bahamas does.   Tommy Bahamas is is one of those place you can dress up for a date night, go in casual while shopping or take a client for a business dinner. It's a place you can be classy or casual.  Today I met a friend for lunch and brought my 4 year old and 12 month old.   Reasons it's mom approved: -Clean, New, Individually Packaged Crayons  -Coloring Sheet on Kids Menu -Highchair to Table height ratio perfect.  -Great Kids Menu Choices.  -Step-stool at restroom sink (no need to lift up my daughter with one arm while holding a baby. That is a BIG plus in my book!)  What the grownups had: -Complimentary fresh made bread and cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg butter (a MUST TRY, don't pass on the bread... they are known for this) -Shishito Peppers (New menu item! Feta, roasted corn salsa, and delicious sauce.) -Crab Bisque (my friend had this, she kept raving about it when she was eating it) -Coconut Shrimp (another MUST TRY. They are famous for their coconut shrimp. We order this every time) -Ahi Tuna Tacos (wonton shell, island slaw, wasabi-avocado cream) -Ahi Tuna Bowl (with quinoa and farro. This was my first time having it. It was so light yet filling. When I have ahi tuna, it's all about the dressing. I love the sesame-soy vinaigrette. The flavor was on-point! I will probably be ordering this next time)  What this kids had: -Kids Chicken Fingers (my daughter had leftovers, we took home. Before bed tonight, she double checked with me to see if we remembered to bring them home... so she must have loved them, lol!) -Mac-N-Cheese (my son is 11 months. He cannot use utensils yet, so the noodles are PERFECT for him to pick up and hold to eat. This is a big bonus, because he can feed himself, freeing me up so I can enjoy my meal.)  Dessert Time: -Pineapple Creme Brulee (my favorite, served in an actual pineapple) -Key Lime Pie (they have key limes shipped from Florida to make this. My daughter's favorite)   Our server: Tiffany was amazing! She is so great with the kids. She talks with them, comments on their coloring. Very friendly and took care of our table. One of the most personable servers there.   We also have had events at Tommy Bahamas in the past. They have a private banquet room, or they have a part of the restaurant that can be sectioned off. If you are looking to book an event, ask for Kaaren! We have worked with her over the years, she is friendly, honest and reliable. She really cares for both the customer and her company. That says a lot about a her. The BEST.   Overall, we absolutely love Tommy Bahamas now and for years to come. We'll probably be having my kids graduation party there in 15 years lol! Since it's located at Town Square, there's shopping and right outside their restaurant is a park and kids play area, so there we always something fun to do before or after dining at Tommy Bahamas. I totally recommend this restaurant.",

I usually Love the cauliflower steak it was just as terrible!!  Not cooked right had no taste of the great marinade and the arugula salad was lacking the great taste of the dressing or whatever they refer to it.

I sat in bar area to take advantage of happy hour, which I've done many times.  One of the bar tenders came by and gave me the menu and asked if I was waiting for someone of which I said no just me.  I was ready to order a drink and he just walked away. Then a group of 3 was seated behind me and another server went directly to their table and took their order while I'm still waiting for someone to come over and take my order.  I'm waiting patiently while the server places their order in the system thinking he's going to come over after, instead he stands there talking to the bartender as if there is no one else to serve.  Anyway, I took it as an indication they didn't value my patronage so I left.  Going to find another place that does.",

A full service bar, plenty of seating and tall ceilings make for a spacious dining area.  We came during a packed Friday lunch rush so it was noisy but our main server was on his game.  His assistant was great with clearing dishes off the table and keeping the drinks fresh.  The kitchen got our dishes out quickly for our party of 4.  T. Bahamas cuisine:  The large shishito peppers were the perfect appetizer.   Large in size (easy to share), not too spicy and the corn and cheese were a perfect compliment.  The chicken tortilla soup was savory in taste but came out in a saucer for minimum quantity.  The grilled chicken and mango salad was great all around.  All the greens were fresh af with the perfect amount of vinaigrette dressing.  The chicken breast was grilled well with no dryness whatsoever.  Good stuff...  Overall the Tommy Bahama Restaurant is a great meal consideration while shopping or hanging out in Town Square.  I'll consider them for more business lunches as the location is convenient, the service is quick and the dishes are fresh and tasty.  Enjoy!",

I ordered a Mushroom Burger but had to send it back because it was too oily and lacked flavor.  We were offered bread but never got it; I asked for garlic aioli on the side and never received it.  I've included a picture from the menu that describes the main courses we had.  For what they charge, the food isn't up to par. I will say though, the smoked salmon appetizer was good...but that's about it.",

We had the shishito peppers, grilled artichoke, Caesar salad, tortilla soup  & both of us had Cubans with a cilantro lime slaw (I'm guessing...didn't say) & yucca fries.  We absolutely enjoyed everything except for the Cuban. It was pretty greasy & the pork lacked flavor. It was ok but not something I'd get again. However, the slaw was refreshing & the yucca fries were delicious. If you haven't been here yet this would be the time to try it either for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "East coast regal elegance meets west coast fun, surf, sand and zest. Come one and all! No surf or sand here! The food and drinks are sure to amaze all palettes with something for all!  Pineapple and strawberries are my weakness, and pair a beautiful cocktail along side that dreams are coming True. The signature dessert here is a fabulous Strawberry Pineapple Creme Brulee. Let's start off any meal with dessert. This dessert is actually not only delicious, but it's good for you too! The Creme Brulee is your essence of the dessert with a twist. The Creme Brulee is set in a real pineapple base. As you eat that Creme Brulee the taste of the real pineapple delicious juices are all combined with the Creme part. Perfection truly! The strawberries on top are sweet and add even more beauty to this fantasy. If you only could choose one thing to exist on this would be that wonder to achieve and amaze all fantasies.   What's better than molten lava cake, Willy Wonka's Chocolate fountain. Or maybe a chocolate fountain that never turns off. How about a whipped chocolate lava cake with ripples of chocolate cream! The chocolate cream lava cake is decadent and will cure any chocolate craving you might have. You will be crawling back after you realize that your lava cake is finished. The whipped cream of this dessert is so light and fluffy. The middle of the lava cake is dark chocolate, and you discover this inner deliciousness after getting halfway through. Yay love some extra hugs and discovery with my chocolate dessert. Always!  While shopping one day at Town Square was my reasoning for dining here. Not that I need a reason at all! All those patrons sitting outside under the umbrellas enjoying themselves looked so relaxing. I was looking for something delicious too. I just have this eye for dessert. Once in a while we have to give ourselves over to chocolate, this was one of those sort of times. That chocolate molten lava cake has a texturized chocolate sauce that it glazed all over the plate ! Then the crust of the molten cake is solid beautiful crust that is so delicious. The middle of the molten cake is a a dark and milk chocolate pudding mix that is so smooth. Then on top is a whipped chocolate fantasy that has a a texturized, glamorous, sexy waves of topping. This chocolate dessert never gets old either. I highly recommend it. Omg this is bliss. This is only the beginning of dessert too, it gets better. The coconut cream cake slice is amazing too. The coconut in that slice is folded over in eight layers with coconut cream in each layer. If you feel brave order both of these desserts and share with someone you love. We always do.   Most of the food choices here are a salad or street taco option. It's more of a healthy type fare of food. The best ingredients and chefs are working to ensure your meal is made to the highest of standards. The chef salad does not disappoint here. This salad is big enough to enjoy between two people and then have fish tacos or a burger. The fish is so fresh in those street tacos it's amazing. The right amount of everything was present from garnish to seasoning in those tacos what a masterpiece. After dining here more and more I come to find myself drawn to the salads since they are so loaded with delicious healthy options. You can have the dressing on the side even if it's not suppose to be. I am not a big fan of bread so maybe thats why I enjoy more salad options when dining out.   Let's visit the bar, shall we. The dining area of the bar is just missing the patio. Just add the sand and some sunshine, this bar would complete any surf style environment. The classiness and finesse of the bar is way upscale with lounge pillow in all the booths. The bar has chandeliers over each booth and truly is more incredible than the actual dining room of the restaurant. The bartenders are knowledgeable about the drinks  that they serve. I had the Painkiller last time I visited the bar area. The pineapple juice was just perfect in the drink. The rum was a little rich but balanced out the tart flavors of the pineapple juice. It was a marriage of therapy that killed my pain for sure.  When you feel that you need a trip to the beach and prefer no sand, then I recommend visiting here. One can relax in the bar with their favorite cocktail plus enjoy some dessert. If you need to dine with family or the young ones in your life the restaurant is family friendly and fun. The lights are bright and beautiful making for excellent dining room excellence either inside or out. The staff is of the utmost trained and professional. They are easygoing and upbeat. The staff will go out of their way to ensure your dining experience is fantastic. Celebrating any special times let the staff know ahead of time they can customize and put happy birthday vibes with cakes slices and so on. The desserts here are wonderful and a delicious treat anytime. So let's meet soon for dessert and drinks.",

    "text": "I visited Tommy Bahama again Saturday night for happy hour and it still wasn't overly packed.  Good for me because I do not enjoy crowds.  What I didn't know is that you must sit out on the patio or at the bar for the happy hour pricing and menu.  It was colder that evening so they let me sit in the restaurant when I said I wasn't comfortable at the bar.    I always have a hard time deciding what I'm in the mood for so I went with my server's suggestion -- Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken.  She said it was her favourite and I will not disagree!  It was delicious and the two sides (broccolini and cauliflower-potato mash) paired PERFECTLY with it.  The mashed potatoes are phenomenal!    I also went for dessert that day since I missed it last time.  I got the well-known Pina Colada cake and honestly, it wasn't as grand as everyone makes it seem.  6/10 but the serving size was more than enough.  I ate half at the restaurant and half at home the next day.  The flavour just wasn't as prominent as I had hoped.  The drinks are always my favourite part.  I had a Mojito, then the Pineapple Paradisio.  The pineapple martini is my new go-to.  It would be nice if the servers came around more frequently.  I waited about 20 minutes for a to-go box and lost count how many times I ran out of water.  There was a 25% check-in coupon but to my surprise it was ONLY for the retail area. The restaurant, bar, and clothing store are all in the same building so the coupons should be interchangeable in my opinion.  I decided to sign up for the Island Club and used the $10 certificate you receive just for joining.  The servers don't advertise this AT ALL but if you go here frequently I suggest it.  Since TB is on the pricier side of restaurant options your points will add up quickly.  I wish I had known about this before since I've already spent a good amount of money here.",

The grits were prepared perfectly and the shrimp and Cajun flavors were outstanding.   For dessert we shared the Pina Colada Cake. It was probably the best cake I've ever had in a restaurant. Maybe the best anywhere.    Our server was on top of things, always keeping drinks filled and checking on us.    Hope to come back again.",

    "text": "We met some friends at Tommy Bahamas at the bar for Happy Hour, which is until 7pm on weekdays and loved the fact that they have a very open, bright and inviting space with seating around the central bar and small booths against the walls.  Unfortunately, their booths seat about 5 people comfortably, so with 8 of us meeting for some snacks and drinks, it was a bit of a squeeze!  HH menus were on the table and have a variety of drinks and snacks, however all items only had their names and didn't specify exactly what was in each dish or drink, so you'll need the main menu with the descriptions to work out what you want to order.  A server with some water came after 10mins and we were able to make an order. We went for the Cuban cocktail, which was good but very strong! The mojitos were great and not long after drinks, some food came out. We tried the kobe dog, cheeseburger sliders, fries and the goats cheese with flatbread.  The kobe dog was served as a sandwich and was pretty basic and plain in flavour. The sliders were really good though, with a decent-sized patty, typical garnishes and a nice mayo sauce so that it wasn't too dry. The fries were typical thin fries, but seasoned well and tasted great. The best dish imo was the goats cheese flatbread. This was a good sized portion and the amount of flatbread chips that came with it was perfect in proportion to the cheese. This came with a subtle dressing that complemented the cheese and some chopped fruit, which was delicious with both the goats cheese and the flatbread. Each bite was creamy, but with a crunch and full of flavour! I'd definitely order that one again!  All in all, a lovely spot to enjoy a variety of drinks and some great food! TB makes an effort to present each dish in a way that makes everything very appetising and for the most part, everything was delicious and a good size in portion.  Would choose this place for HH again, maybe with a few less friends though, so we can all fit in the booths next time!",

Hey, if I'm spending $150 on an afternoon (1.5 hours) of fun, I want attention! My glass was empty and no one asked if I was ok. They were so busy doing something with mint and prepping for the Happy Hour crowd that my full price patronage wasn't appreciated. Awful for them. I left 15%-plus, but I'm a very generous tipper when I get good service. Next time I'm in Vegas, sorry Tommy, I won't be visiting this location. Perhaps your servers at the bar can be taught to appreciate loyal patrons. Truly yours, An Ex Tommy Fan",

    "text": "Dear Allen -- I advise you NOT to come back for dinner.  We are big, BIG Tommy Bahama fans.  We have a house on Maui with lots of Tommy barware.  My husband owns tons of Tommy's Hawaiian shirts.  We were really looking forward to eating here after standing in line for an iPhone 3G for three hours.  (At least we finally got one.)    We were seated promptly and taken our drink orders with dispatch.  That was almost the last we saw of our waiter without tripping him (and even that didn't always work).  We got water.  We were told there was no bread yet.  For appetizers I had the crab soup (OK, but not memorable) and my husband had the coconut crusted crab cakes (terrific, terrific Asian slaw with them).  Eventually we got bread, but it was so sweet (and so was the non-butter spread) that neither of us had more than a bite.  Does sweet bread make up for the bitter drinks?  The bar was backed up, so we had finished our appetizers before we got our drinks.  Maybe their Mai Tai mix had fermented.  Whatever, it was pretty ghastly and I didn't even finish it.  My husband had the Pelican Punch (Fruit Punch with not enough rum to speak of).    My husband's main course was the Seared Ahi Salad (too much wasibi sauce on it for me) and I had the Chicken Salad Junkanoo.  What kitchen of any quality would send out a mess like this?  Consider some underripe grapes and unsweet orange slices surrounding a thick slice of toasted wonder bread (supposed to be Sourdough) with a couple of table spoons of watery chicken salad on top.  No wonder they had bread underneath the salad!  Something needed to act like a sponge for the dripping greens.  There was even an unappetizing piece of chicken skin in the salad.  My husband did want to try the Pina Colada cake that he saw on the dessert tray on the way inside, but after two tries to get more water (he got ice, no water), we paid in cash and escaped.  I don't think Tommy had this in mind for \"making your escape\".  Maybe other instances of this chain are better, but this was a disaster.",

The unemployment rate is so high EVERYWHERE that there are plenty of people who look better and posses so much more professionalism than NATALIE!  yes, Natalie.  She'll remember from the table she was so rude to earlier this evening.  Katie, an amazing server, split a salad that me and my bf had ordered.  When the food was being brought to the table half of a salad was brought out and our entire table laughed bc it looked so small.  Natalie then replies to our cackle by saying \"what?... I couldn't bring both salads out\"  rolls eyes and walks off.  She left us at the table stunned, we became more stunned as were were informed she was the manager of the establishment.  What nerve for a woman who is clearly dressed inappropriately (wearing a sleeveless shirt without the body to go with this type of top).    I yelped this as promised, and if it werent for the cool server the tip would have almost been non existent.  Natalie, if you dont like your job quit.  Its a waste of your time and patrons when you take your unhappiness out on us.    As for the food, it was yummy.  The regular menu is definitely over-priced but the bar is a great place to go for happy hour with  live hawaiian style music playing in the background.",

I have to say that the bad taste left in my mouth from the utter lack of customer service in CA was quickly erased as we were seated at the bar in Tommy Bahama's. The bartender, Katie, greeted us immediately and asked us where we wanted to sit. She brought over water and menus without us even asking for them. My friend was commenting that her phone was dead and Katie brought over her own personal rapid charger and plugged my friends phone in. Then she helped me decide on what to drink, I was torn between wine and their sangria. Katie responded with \"Don't you worry about it, I am going to make you something that you will love!\" She was right on. It was delicious. She then proceeded to tell us about their mind blowing Happy Hour and all the different appetizers they offered. After we paid the bill, the General Manager came over, introduced himself and asked if everything was ok. Superior Customer Service is an understatement. They really nailed it. We will be back. Thank you Katie!",

(I don't eat fish, but it was beautifully presented) and a caesar salad, which was the real deal.  A friend and I'd had a late lunch so we shared a basket of fries (nice fresh cut fries) and I ordered the Tortola Tortilla Soup, wonderfully filling, very generous bowl, savory and our friend ordered the Cooper Island Crab Bisque, which she thoroughly enjoyed.  It's a bit pricey, but worth an occasional splurge.  Live steel drum music, and I was transported to an island or the Florida Keys... aaaahhhhhhhh!  Lovely.",

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and my friend had the Bungalow salad.  We also ordered the goat cheese as an appetizer.  What I didn't like is that they charged an $6 because we asked for veggies to eat with our goat cheese instead of the flatbread listed on the menu.  However, I didn't complain or ask questions, so they might have reversed that charge if I had asked.  One last thing, prepare to spend quite a bit because this place is not for a light wallet... especially if you plan on having a drink or two.",

    "text": "On this July 2011 trip to Vegas, my husband and I decided to do some shopping and get some dinner at Town Square before checking into our hotel. Town Square is located between McCarran Airport and the Strip...but that's for another Yelp review...on to the Tommy Bahama's review...  It's a store...and it's a restaurant/bar! We decided on eating here because of the atmosphere..like you're on a Caribbean vacation. There's palm trees, ceiling fans, white shutters..and it wasn't very crowded. The menu made my mouth water and I couldn't decide what to get. So since we were on vacation we decided to not hold back! Ready for this? We ordered and shared the Ahi Tuna Tacos, Seared Scallop Sliders, Coconut-Crusted Crab Cakes, the Crab Bisque, the Mushroom & Onion Kobe Burger and a salad (which I really could have done without but thought I'd get something light and \"healthy\" haha). The food was to die for!! The Ahi Tuna Tacos were yummy, in crunchy wonton shells with some asian slaw and wasabi-lime avocados. The scallop sliders were my favorite because they were good sized scallops that were juicy and seemed to melt in my mouth. The crispy onions that were with it gave it a tasty crunch. Oh and the Mushroom & Kobe Burger was amazing, and I'm not a big burger fan. That was a whole lot of food for just the 2 of us but we pretty much polished it off (except for the salad) and had no room for dessert.  I really wanted a mojito but it wasn't on the drink menu. So I asked our waiter if there was any possibility that the bartender could make one for me and sure enough they did! I was very satisfied and had a second one. ;)  I look forward to eating here again on our next trip to Vegas, but the next time saving room for dessert!",

    "text": "While heading to Tommy Bahama I was perplexed talking to my friend over the phone who had discovered they were offering a happy hour on a Thursday night.   \"What? You mean the place that sells the Hawaiian shirts?\"  Well yes, they do, but this one has a restaurant/bar attached to it. And they DO have a very wonderful happy hour menu. I started off with a Chardonnay ($6) and then moved on to their Mai Tai ($6). I wish I had had two Mai Tai's! It was delicious and it packed a punch! I was feeling a little tipsy. The presentation was nice too.   I had the fish tacos off the happy hour menu. The tastes were delectable and even though they were tiny little tacos there was plenty of grilled fish in them. I love grilled fish tacos and I hate fried fish tacos, bleck. However they were a bit on the cool side. I think they may have been sitting for a few moments too long before being brought out. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying them.  So, those are all the good things. Here are some not-so-good things. First off there was a guy there \"playing\" guitar. I use quotations because half the time he was not actually playing his guitar, but instead messing around with his Mac Book which was playing his music for him? Eh, lame. Next off when I was drinking my wine the bartender swooped up the little decanter she had given me along with the wine glass, well there was still wine in it! My jaw literally dropped and I stared at her in disbelief. She quickly deposited it back in front of me and I snatched it up and poured the rest of the wine in my glass quickly. I don't know if it was an accident, but either way it was incredibly awkward. Lastly, the bartender also dropped off the incorrect check for my friend and I (and then we never saw her again). A new bartender arrived who prodded us into purchasing more drinks, but then left us and never returned to see if we actually wanted more drinks.  Luckily another bartender finally noticed our displeasure because I'm assuming it was radiating from us after being given a check that was #1 not ours and #2 WAY more expensive than our actual check. This bartender was very nice and quick to fix the mix up though.  In conclusion - Tommy Bahama's not just for ugly pineapple shirts anymore!",

We started out with the chicken lollipops and the chicken was nice and juicy and the dipping sauce that came with it my wife really enjoyed.  My wife had the Parmesan Crust Snivel Chicken, the chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce that was served with it was to die for.  It came with a side of mashed potatoes which where very creamy and seasoned well.  I had the Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs, I only got a half rack but the ribs seemed very small and didn't have a lot of meat on them.  The BBQ sauce on them was really good tho.  My mashed potatoes seemed to be sitting out for to long and had a very dry taste to them.  I even put my potatoes next to my wifes and you could see mine had a brownish tint to them.  Over all we enjoyed the food I just wish they had some consistence in the food because I really did enjoy my wifes potatoes.

    "text": "I took my mother here on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm. The place seemed to be about half full. It's very stylish and the decor isn't cramped. Relaxing, but vibrant. We grabbed a table outside as it was close to the entrance because my Mom can't walk far. Our bullish choice may have been an inconvenient location for the waitstaff. The waitress was friendly and smart but we saw her very infrequently. Not sure, but she may have been a manager picking up slack. She told us what was especially popular on the menu, but we didn't take any of her recommendations. In hindsight, I think she was steering us toward the tastier items on the menu and away from the so-so items. She mentioned that they had fresh baked bread and we told her that would be great, but it never arrived and we didn't remind her. She seemed like she was playing catch-up on those occasions when we did see her. Kindly, she did make change for a dollar as the local parking meters there only take coins and we knew right off the bat they weren't going to be able to serve us our meal within an hour. We got the coconut shrimp appetizer and it was good, but not close to the best in town. Not the largest shrimp either. One of the four was much smaller than the others. The entrees took a long time. My Mom ordered a burger and for her taste, the bun was far too soggy. It was almost wet. She would have liked it to have been toasted. I can't see how that could have been eaten without silverware. We had to ask for salt, pepper and mustard as there wasn't any available on the table. Those items came quickly though. The french fries were kind of airy and relatively free of grease. I ordered the blackberry baby back ribs and they were okay, but nothing I would order twice. It was only a half rack, which was fine, but I think the item cost about $19, which for my experience, normally gets you a full rack. There were a few birds in the area begging for food and the people seated next to us fed them a full roll on the floor near our table. We could have done without the lengthy floor show that ensued, but that's hardly the restaurant's fault. Very clean restaurant from what I could see and very nice flatware as well. Nice people.",

She made some great recommendations and was never MIA!  2 stars = for the Crab Bisque.  Yum!  This soup was delish!  It is a definite must try!  3 stars = for the Santiago Sea Bass.  I love fish, and this dish was made beyond my expectations  4 stars = for the environment.  Well lit, and not too fancy to where you have to feel like you have to dress formal.  But fancy enough that the you feel fancy!  I will definitely come here again to bring a friend for lunch or dinner.  It's a great place to come and have good conversation over a great meal.",

Exceptionally delicious, the kind of drink you will remember & crave.  The scallop sliders were fantastic and fresh, and the slivers of onion rings were the tastiest I've ever sampled.  Quick service, relaxing/calm atmosphere, flavorful food & drinks.",

She has the perfect personality for the service industry and our drinks were timely. But that's not all. This girl makes one helluva key lime martini! Our service was top notch and she handled herself like a True professional. The food was decadent, as always, and the happy hour music wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear the person next to you. I always cringe when I hear the term \"live music\" but this was quiet, pleasant, and even enjoyable. We will definitely be coming back for happy hour and sitting at the bar so that we can have more of Kelly's FANTASTIC martinis!",

    "text": "After filling our tummies with HH food specials from Brio, Tommy Bahama's Tropical Cafe was next on our happy hour tour along Town Square.  They offer happy hour daily from 4 pm to 7 pm.  They do offer quite a few drinks and food items such as small plate appetizers for $5 and drinks ranging from $3-$7.  (Beer $3, Martinis $7)  We only stuck to the drink menu this time around.  I started off with:   * Coconut Cloud Martini \"Tommy Bahama White Sand Rum, Stoli Vanil vodka, Cruzan Coconut rum, cream of coconut, shaken, strained and sprinkled with toasted coconut.\" - A smooth drink of coconut goodness that has you transporting to the islands soon!  Their touch of toasted coconut on top really brings the drink together and gives it a nice crunch and aftertaste.    Next up:   * Kohala Coladas \"Bacardi Superior rum and cream of coconut added to your favorite flavor - Mango, Key Lime and Pina Colada - blended with ice and topped with a dark rum float.\"  I went with mango for mine and you really can't go wrong with a colada here.  A piece of pineapple and an umbrella tops it off.  The Husband isn't usually one for 'fruity' drinks, but the lure of banana and coconut had him downing a few of these babies:  * The BBC \"Bailey's and Emmet's Irish Cremes, fresh banana and cream of coconut, blended with ice.\" - What can I say but damn, this is good. It tastes like a coconut and banana smoothie.  At first you can't even taste the alcohol, which of course has you wondering if there's really any in it.  But once you get up, you'll feel it.  There's good stuff in there!  It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon, compared to the other neighboring restaurants running happy hour.  I think it's because their bar is all inside and you do have a \"Tommy Bahama\" type crowd if that makes any sense.  Our bartenders were pleasant and drinks arrived quickly, so we had no problems with service here at all.  And there's live music too - someone playing a few cover songs is an added bonus.  Overall, Tommy Bahama's is a more laid back place to be when you want to sip some umbrella drinks, feel like you're on vacation, and not get mixed up in the dress to impress crowd.  And plus, their drinks are yummy good and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you.",

Very well appointed drinks were finished along with a special asparagus soup prepared by chef Reuben.  Waitress Dominique professionally handled our orders while manager Kevin oversaw the entire dining experience.  We were treated like royalty during our meal because the way to determine if our waitress is doing a great job is by not noticing her serving the table.  The food was cooked correctly and the presentation was excellent.  Remember when the food looks good it usually tastes good.  Our food was superb.  Our salad was served on cold plates and the entree was served on hot plates.  This enabled the course to remain in the proper temperature through consumption.  We completed our meal with the pina colada cake.  It was a huge slice that we split between the four of us and we were left licking our forks.  I cannot remember a meal that was any better from the beginning to end.  Our thanks to the staff for a job well done because we will definitely return.  In the past the 3 most important words in the restaurant business was location, location, location;  but currently the 3 most important words are \" I'll be back\"!  And all of us agree that we will return.",

    "text": "Wow, what a difference over the course of a year.  I reviewed Tommmy Bahama's almost a year ago, and I thought it was great.  The steaks were great, and even the sweet potatoes, which I normally don't like, were great.    We have been going to Tommy Bahama's about twice per month since then, and each time has been good, with the exception of this last time.    Things started off okay, we got our table, got our appetizers, and all was good.  But then the steak came.  My girlfriend just thinks it was overcooked, but it tasted like much cheaper meat to me.  The filet was bland and stringy.  And the sweet potatoes were actually the same, tasteless and stringy.  Odd, but True.  The whole meal was sort of so-so.    The service was okay, but there was something not quite right.  The staff seemed on edge.  It was a weird feeling, like they were just not happy to be there.  And then the topper; my girlfriend put some sweet potato on a smaller plate to try them out, and some women came by and snatched her plate of food away.  She still had her food on it, and the woman never asked if we wanted it taken away.  The woman was wearing a pink polo shirt, so she looked more like one of the managers than a server.  We thought about complaining, but it just felt like maybe it wasn't worth it.    Not to look to much into this, but I wonder if the place is having financial issues, so the food is not as good and the people are on edge.  Either way, it's a shame because this was a regular place for us to hang out for a nice dinner out, and we would usually grab some stuff from the store after the meal.  We may give it once last chance, maybe this was an off night, but it feels like the magic might be gone from this one.",

    "text": "*** Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***  This would be a three star review if not for the outstanding service we received.  This was an afterthought when I was looking at the RW offerings.  I decided it was wife friendly (it's difficult to get her to try different things).    We came here in the late afternoon.  I had checked the times online and the Tommy Bahama website said dinner was from 4 on.   We were there at 4:30 and got the lunch RW menu and were told that dinner service begins at 5 PM.  That's where our server, Naomi, showed us what the service would be like.  She went to the kitchen and then came back.  After collecting our lunch menus, she went to the stand and brought back the dinner menus.  I started with the coconut shrimp with an Asian slaw.  The shrimp were resting on a mango-papaya chutney.  My wife had the classic Caesar--romaine leaves with Grana Padano cheese and garlic croutons.  Both were good starters.  My shrimp  had little coconut flavor.  During our starters, Naomi brought some hot bread from the kitchen.  They serve the bread with a cinnamon butter which is quite good.  I thought it was odd that they had no bread plates.  I happened to have my starter plater so I could use that.  For the main courses, I got the pork loin and my wife got the parmesan crusted Sanibel chicken breast--a selection not shown on their online RW menu but a good choice.  Naomi asked how I liked the pork--medium and I said rare to medium-rare.  I didn't want the meat too dead.  It was cooked too much and it wasn't a bit juicy.  It was a huge loin--almost like they took a loin and cut it in half.  It was served with asparagus and 6 silver dollar size sweet potato pancakes.  The sides were very good!  My wife's chicken was good.  Her chicken came on a bed of garlic mashed and some broccolini.    For dessert, I got the pina colada cake and my wife got the four layer triple chocolate cake.  Excellent and once again, a large portion.  Iced tea was refilled promptly without asking.  Naomi was always around without being intrusive and she had a sparkling personality!  She makes this a 4 star review.  ** I apologize for only having two photos.  I forgot to bring my Yelp camera and my phone went dead after just two.",

    "text": "I'm not convinced that this restaurant can stand up with everything else in town square. So we've been wanting to try this place out because we heard good things about it. So the place as far as decor was awesome it felt really high end. Now when i looked at the menu the items they had were very simple and stuff that had their own twist on it.   Our server recommended that i try their vegas burger and my wife had the filet mignon and we had the Ahi Poke Napoleon*. Now the bill i think was the most outrageous part of this meal because for that a couple drinks and a dessert the meal was like $100.   Ahi Poke napoleon (3/5 stars)- just your typical raw tuna dressed with sesame oil and on top of avocado came with some chips to eat with  Vegas Burger (3/5 stars)- It had alot of ingredients. Cheese, bacon, egg, and this pineapple glaze on a toasted egg bun. the burger was good but it was the pineapple glaze that totally threw it off.if they were to put some ranch and a little it of that glaze on the patty it might have tasted better  Filet MIgnon (1/5 stars)- being that i just went to Mastros to eat i think my expectations were that it was going to be a good steak but nope..overpriced and not well prepared  Overall i love the service and love the restaurant but if i eat here again i will probably order something else..Tommy Bahamas you owe me one!!!",

I only ordered one item:  House Roasted Pork Sandwich ($13.50)- Blackberry Brandy BBQ , Crispy Onions, Asian Slaw, Fries. This item on the menu is huge! Huge portion for a small girl but it was really good. The roasted shredded pork was flavorful.   Customer service: I have been eating around Town Plaza during lunch this week and so far Tommy Bahama provides the best customer service. Shout out to Brandon. He was great! Very knowledgeable and went above and beyond with providing us great service.  Overall, I will definitely come to this place again.",

I felt a little under classed with how fancy some of the other customers dressed and the ambiance of the restaurant was also nice but relaxing. I had some kind of sashimi style fish taco my wife ordered and it was probably the best fish taco I've ever had and I'm from socal!  I ordered pork belly fried rice and thought it was perfect. Probably about 1 1/2 cups alone of fried rice which being Asian makes me very happy. Not stingy on the pork belly cubes either. My mojito was strong which   the way I like it if I'm spending that much. My waiter gave great service with no problems and was always there when i needed something and made great recommendations and gave us plenty of sauces when needed. Price wasn't too expensive considering it's town square mall. I'm definitely coming back.",

Our server was Jarrett and he was very considerate (respectfully offering us chopsticks) and helped us Vegas first timers feel right at home with his friendly demeanor. Keep it up Jarrett!  The decor was beautifully done, light enough to easily read menus and dim enough to be mood lighting. Atmosphere was comfortably chatty but not too loud.  Food wise our expectations were definitely met. The ahi tuna entree was my favorite dish and my father heavily praised their scallops. The Mahi Mahi fish itself was mediocre but the quinoa it came with was delicious. The complimentary bread and honey ginger butter was ridiculously addictive...  All in all, easiest (and first) 5/5 ever given.",

Julian the bartender was very funny & informative. After a quick peruse of the menu I decided on the HOUSE ROASTED PORK SANDWICH (bbq pulled pork) and I was quoted 10 minutes...let the timer begin!  My order arrived within the time quoted and after a 15 minutes drive to the office my lunch was still piping hot. AND DELISH!!  I've never had a piled high pulled pork as good as this one. I didn't even need to add bbq sauce as the flavor without stood on its own. Totally impressed & well worth the $13.50!  I arrived back at work on time.   I'll be back for more of this. It was HUGE & enough for lunch AND dinner.",

I almost felt like I was somewhere tropical. The tables and booths are spaciously spread out as to not have that on top of the other table kind of feel. There is a nice banquet room for special occasions. A separate bar area to keep those rowdy sports fans under control. :) The patio would be an awesome place to dine during pleasant weather. Service was friendly and attentive. I felt like our server Brandon was really happy helping us with our meal. I even got a candle in my pineapple creme brulee which was nice. The menu prices were a bit high, but I felt like eating there and paying those prices- you get what you pay for in a very good way. So if you have a special occasion or a loved one that you want to treat to a great dining experience, I'd say give this place a try.",

I love the ambiance because it feels like a mini vacation while you wait for your order.   I started with the Crab Bisque . It had little bits of blue crab, sherry, cream and crushed croutons. It had a light sweet taste with a pinch of saltiness. It was crabtastic! I think this has a slightly better taste then Texas De Brazil 's Lobster Bisque.   I ordered the Thai Shrimp and Scallops as my main entree. I was hesitant at first because some places under cook the scallops where they taste a little too chewy . They cooked the scallops perfect! I expect scallop to be flaky and not gooey. The curry taste was mild which I prefer. I liked that the coconut/ curry taste  didn't over power each other.   We ended the meal with the Pina Colada cake. My husband and my brother wanted something chocolaty but I had way too much chocolate for Valentine's day  so we ordered the cake. Everyone at the table liked it because it was nice and moist and the frosting wasn't heavy or overly sweet.   The service was also on point and very accommodating!",

Very moist, tasty, and the fried plantains with the tropical fruit dipping pudding sauce topped with toasted coconut that come on the side, are simply amazing and compliment the dish beautifully!! Other recommendations are the grilled lime infused Mahi Mahi fish, served on a bed of almond rice and grilled asparagus.

May be too salty for some people but worked very well for me, especially with this fish. Reasonably priced too. My whole family enjoyed this place. While my friends come here for lunch for a reason. Nice atmosphere and great location too.",

    "text": "My family and I wanted to try Tommy Bahama's mostly because we are really familiar with the clothing line and had never heard of the restaurant. And I'm so glad we went on this culinary adventure. I can not seriously think of a single complaint about my dining experience here... except that it might be a little pricey, but I definitely didn't mind as soon as I took a bite of the food!  Crab Bisque soup- Bring me a whole bucket of this soup because it is CRAZY good!! Super rich in flavor with lumps of crab- just the perfect way to start the meal. It was worth the $1.50 upgrade to get it.  Salmon salad- salmon crusted in panko on a salad with mango salsa all tied together with a Hoisin vinaigrette. WOW! This salad was light and refreshing. The vinaigrette was just perfect to balance the sweetness of the mangoes. And the salmon was so juicy and tender with the perfect crunch from the panko crust. It's seriously the perfect lunch dish! I would order this again in a heart beat.  Next time I'm in Towne Square, I'm definitely coming back to try their other delectable dishes!",

A little too laid-back for those of us who have a limited lunch hour. Why is it always the \"other table\" has the fun waiter that is attentive to service?   Food was delicious (when it finally arrived), and as always, the fish tacos were great. Be careful of filling up on the fresh, warm bread and cinnamon butter while you wait for the main course.  Obviously this practically became our meal while we waited for our waiter to stroll over with our lunch.  If you truly want to experience this place at its best, try the late afternoon, early evening when the sun dips and people are darting in and out of the various stores close by. Great place to meet with friends and sip mojitos.",

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas traveling and visiting my sister.  Before we went out on the town we decided to stop by Tommy Bahama's for dinner.  There was a bit of wait so my friend and I decided to grab a drink at the bar.  When you walk in the shop, bar, and restaurant are all right next to each other.  Kind of interesting.    While waiting on the bartender we listened to a live solo singer and his guitar. Usually these people are either loud, annoying or bad but this guy had just the right sound. He played alternative, rock, and pop music.  Things that people could sing along to.  I really liked him.  I ordered a Mojito which was soooo delicious.  Bartenders usually don't know how to make a good tasting Mojito. This lady did!   Anyways, our table was ready within 5 minutes. They sat us down by an open door. It was, of course, nice outside.    I ordered a salad and within 15 minutes it came out. Honestly this had to be the best salad I've ever had.  It had steak and some potato and whatever dressing they used was to die for. I wasn't  that hungry coming in, but after my first bite I couldn't stop myself. I wanted more! I couldn't  allow myself to order dessert knowing I'd devour it.   Who knew the original clothing store could create an amazing restaurant. They need more of these in Chicago!    Well next time I'm back in Vegas Im definitely stopping by Tommy's.  I want more salad and I want it now!",

Came in during happy hour so it was priced well, yay!  Had the Salmon BLTA, as it seemed like a good day to have a sandwich; the sun going down, air a bit breezy. It was a good thing I chose outside seating. ANYWAYS, the salmon sandwich was pretty good, so it surprised me when I was told I was lucky, as it was being taken off the menu.  At the end of my meal, I was offered a postcard, which I can send anywhere in the world, and Tommy Bahamas pays for the postage! I sent it to my gorgeous girlfriend (great place to come drinking often fellas; always remind your S.O. you are thinking of them!)",

I love that their happy hour runs from 4 - 7 PM (Yardhouse and Brio both end at 6 PM so it's really tough to make it there after work!).   Drinks: *The ones with banana were too overpowering for us. I hate that they put sprite in a mojito. It's simple syrup + club soda idiots! The sangria is decent but has lots of brandy, so make sure you're ok with that before ordering. The favorite was the mai thai - still super sweet like the other drinks, but at least had some nice tart citrus to balance it out. Honestly the drinks are relatively disappointing - I would expect perfect fruity drinks from a place inspired by Tommy Bahama's. Drinks average ~$6 during happy hour  Food (All of these are $5 during HH)  *Coconut Shrimp -while it only comes with 3 shrimp, they were amazing! My fiance is a coconut shrimp freak and declared these the best he'd ever eaten. We ordered a 2nd order of these as soon as we tasted them. The papaya mango sauce they are sitting in is awesome too.  *Pork sliders - we found the pork dried out and over cooked. Fail.  *Cheeseburgers - could use more cheese, and they were overcooked, but otherwise these are pretty damn tasty. I'd get them again.  *Quesadilla - Yum! Lots of chicken and deliciousness inside. Decent portion, etc. Recommended.   Love the cool classical music they play, love the vibe. Drinks could use a little work, but food was overall great. Officially added onto my regular happy hour rotation!",

Tommy Bahama doesn't associate itself as being a Hawaiian Shirt brand (there are some TB stores on the islands), but rather, a Fine Resort Wear brand. Oh, and those cilantro-pineapple candles are so yummy smelling.     Ok, there was a joke about young guys wearing TB shirts on \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" My husband is a fan of the silk hawaiian camp shirts, which typically run around $125. I'm a fan of the dresses (runs about $78- $135, the average dress is $125), but I've also got shorts, and a sweater too by TB. We both love the copyrighted prints, the quality, and the designs. This is such a popular brand, that there are knock-offs of the mens shirts, so you have to be careful, if you're not shopping at the TB stores.",

The place was pretty much empty save for a couple of groups of people so it was pretty quiet for the most part. The lady working the bar was immensely sweet and beautiful and she showed me the happy hour menu and gave me a few tips on how to save some money while eating.      I had both the burger sliders and the pork quesadilla and both were amazingly good. The burger sliders were a tad small but they were well cooked and flavorful.  The only issue with the sliders was the price differentiation from the quesadilla. The sliders were 7 dollars and you got less food while the quesadilla is 6 bucks. The pork quesadilla was recommended by the bartender and boy was I glad I took her advice. The quesadilla was  really well made and a pretty big meal considering it's very reasonable price (6 bucks like I said!). The quesadilla is served with a nice heaping side of mango salsa and is topped with goat cheese and beautifully cooked pork.  The happy hour was a highlight and I honestly will be coming back for the food and whenever I really crave some good rum. A word of advice though for any rum fans. So because they have over 200 different selections of rum, prices will vary depending on what you get. Cheaper rums (Captain Morgan, Bacardi, Sailor Jerry, etc) are right behind her on ground level while the really expensive stuff is above her with the whiskeys.  My Kraken Black Rum and Coke ended up costing 8 dollars which honestly wasn't bad at all and was pretty reasonable since it didn't tie into the Happy Hour. The only real con about the whole experience but not enough to deduct a star was the Happy Hour drink selection. Happy Hour really only covers a few wine selections, some rum concoctions, and really basic island drinks like a Mai Tai or Margarita.     All in all I really enjoyed my experience and the prices were not that bad. To show you how reasonable the prices were i'm a full time college student who is almost always broke due to tuition and I was able to eat at Tommy Bahamas lol. I was a bit afraid of the price because of the Town Square location but Tommy Bahamas offers really good food and drinks at a very reasonable price!  I definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes island style restaurants without the touristy feel that some of them have and also to people who want good food without the strip prices. This was a great experience and I will certainly be coming back.",

    "text": "Our favorite waitress Becky told us to visit her at Tommy Bahama's for a great happy hour and amazing food. We finally went into the restaurant tonight not sure what to expect. First of all, we definitely under estimated the size of the space. The restaurant is much bigger than it looks from the outside and is a generally nice space. They had live music playing in the bar that you can hear throughout the dining room and the atmosphere was sort of romantic but still comfortable. We were very happy with the ambience.  We were happy that Becky was working tonight to help guide us through the menu. She convinced us to be adventurous with our food choices and I'm so glad she did. Without her I wouldn't have known how delicious Yucca fries are! I tried new things and even the simplest things, like my chicken sandwich were well above average. My only regret is that I wish I saved room for desert because those looked just as amazing as the food was!   If you have walked past this restaurant with curiosity like we have, I strongly recommend that you check it out. The flavors are so deliciously different than any other restaurant and definitely a place you'll want to visit again!",

    "text": "The only reason I am giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the portion size and the price.  The portions are decent, but will likely not fill you unless you get appetizers and a dessert. And though the food is excellent, I found the price to be a bit steep for what you got. That being said, the service is fantastic and the food superb.  I had the fish tacos, which were probably some of the best fish tacos that I have ever had.  The appetizers we had were the short rib sliders and the coconut shrimp.  Both were delicious.  We topped our meal off with butterscotch pudding and pina colada cake. The pudding was really good, but the cake seemed a little bland.  They also had live music playing, which was great.  I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "We decided to try Tommy Bahamas out for restaurant week and our experience was so-so. We arrived around 5 and were sat at a nice table by the patio. Our appetizers were delicious, I had the lobster bisque and my fiance had the coconut shrimp.   Unfortunately after our appetizers we waited almost another 30 minutes before our meal came out. When it did arrive, my steak and potatoes was cold. It was obvious the steak had been sitting in the window- it was sliced, dried out and almost medium well ( I ordered it medium). I have never had cold mashed potatoes at a restaurant before- I was pretty shocked. My fiances fish was cooked perfectly and was warm, no complaints on his dish. It was more disappointing because the restaurant was not busy.   When our server came over to collect our dirty dishes she asked if we were ready for her to put our dessert order in which explained why our dinner had come out so long after our appetizers! She didn't even ring our meals in until we were done with our appetizers! Overall our meal took two hours because of poor judgement and timing by our server. We won't be back.",

The decor is interesting, reminding me of a repurposed Ralph Lauren with monkey murals. It was very comfortable but I didn't get the island time feeling. For that I guess I'll go to Frankie's Tiki Room.",

We were tempted to go to some well known places on the strip but opted for TB, due to time constraints and proximity. Boy oh boy, we were so not disappointed!!!! From the first greeting to the bread to the meal, everything was fabulous. The bread with cinnamon butter was melt in your mouth yummy and the drinks were worth it. My hubs devoured the truffle-thyme salmon, I indulged in the macadamia but crusted snapper served with almond rice & asparagus, and my toddler enjoyed the chicken tenders (they were crunchy and light goodness). The servers were friendly and attentive, as my water glass never went empty. It seemed like she had a magic button on the glass or something. To top it off we even received a birthday dessert on the house!!!!  That was a complete surprise and oh so appreciated. The pina colada cake did not disappoint. It was like a melt in your mouth cake, which my hubs compared to cotton candy. The slice is so enormous that we couldn't even finish it. The linen type napkins were also an added plus along with the breath taking plantation decor & ambiance. Thank you, TB Restaurant for making my bday experience a great one. We are lookin for other locations to try next!!!",

We had a few items for starters which were all well liked and a great start to the meal. The main courses came hot and well presented. We all had different choices, mine being the short ribs.  AMAZING.  So tender and tasty! Everyone raved about their meal and we all left satisfied and happy.  Later, when I noticed I made an error on my check the management was easy to work with and quick to rectify the problem.

Happy hour is only available on the patio or at the bar. It was a little chilly so we asked for a heater which he said was no problem.   Joni was our server and quickly arrived to take our drink orders. There are several HH drinks available, everything from beer, wine and cocktails. We chose the sangria and coconut cloud martini. The coconut cloud was SOOO GOOD. Ron Matusalem Platino, Vanilla Stoli, Coconut rum, cream of coconut and toasted coconut on top. I could have drank about 6 of these!   We perused the HH small plates and decided on the following:  Coconut shrimp- 4/5. 3 large shrimp covered in coconut. For $8 was hoping for at least 4. Blackened fish tacos- 4/5. 2 tacos with cabbage and lime sour cream. Very good.  Roasted pork quesadilla 4/5. About 6 pieces (1/2 a regular one?) loaded with delicious pork and cheese.  Macadamia crusted goat cheese- 5/5. This was really good, loved the flavor combinations. Ended up ordering a second one.  Ahi Poke napoleon- 5/5. Fresh Ahi tuna on avocado, delicious. Again we ordered a second one it was so good.   Ended with the pina colada cake- 3/5. Didn't live up to its description. Lacked any Myers Rum flavor. All the food came out fast and our service throughout was pretty good. The first heater only lasted 5 minutes. The couple next to us asked for another one which they brought out. That one lasted about another 5 minutes as well. No one ever came to try and fix it or try a third one.   Overall really happy with the happy hour and would definitely return again!",

My cocktail was somewhere around $12. Now right here, you're looking at a tab of around $62, right? Here is where the issue lies: my husband asked to see the scotch menu. He was told there was only ONE scotch available, Mcclellan's I believed as the the answer given. My husband ordered it. The server NEVER told my husband that it was $30 a shot. Had my husband been told that he would have ordered a Guinness. Now, even at $30 my bill Is only at $92. THEM WHY WAS MY FINAL BILL $115.68??? When called to the management's attention I was given a song and dance about not wanting to give customers prices because it appears rude...are you kidding me??? You still overcharged me!! In short, the restaurant has done nothing. So I am currently disputing the charge with my bank. Again, the management did nothing, except offer to comp me a meal. Please, they couldn't afford my bar tab. The handling of this was abysmal. Not only have they lost a dining customer, but I will no longer be buying g my husband's clothing there. Bad. All the way around. Poorly handled.",

It was flawless and on point..(seeing that I grew up in Miami) served with fried yucca, which was just the way it should be cooked, (crispy on the outside and soft on the inside) and a most refreshing lemony salad. And then we ended the lunch with a most special Key Lime pie. Yumm  I so recommend this restaurant. They make you feel special..We actually received a small bowl of their tomato bisque from the Chef for our first time visit, for us to try. Awesome treatment, I'd say!  It was lucious to say the least...The food is made with care...nice plating..clean place. Everyone/Staff is very attentive. No complaints here guys...Give this a try, you will not regret it.....

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR EVERY FREAKEN DAY!! 4-7 LIFE IS ONE LONG WEEKEND  **2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #1**  The way to start a new year is by thinking of how you ended the year before.  I will start off by saying that I can FINALLY write a review for this darn restaurant now that I no longer am employeed by them. I have dedicated 5 years of my youth to this place & it has been the most AWSOME years of friendship w/ co-workers along w/ life long regulars who have become my friends.   The atmosphere for this place is very mellow & relaxing. They have live performers from Tuesday- Saturday during dinner time. You get the whole Caribbean vibe starting from the bamboo host stand to the sea shell ceiling lamps. BEST time to go eat & really enjoy your RELAXATION time is during the spring when all the SLIDING doors open up & make you feel like you are dining outdoors whether you sit inside or outside.  FOOD is always the best of quality & if not the best to your standards... they do their very BEST to make you HAPPY even if they know you are wrong... they want to make your experience the best they can. I guess that is the power of a CORPORATION. The MONTHLY SPECIALS are seriously a HIGH recommendation as they are created by the ACTUAL executives chefs on site & not by the corporate Chef Don Donly ( don't get me wrong... he busts out some awesome dishes) but the point is that the menu will ALWAYS be there but the specials will never be seen again typically.   The service is great, each individual server has their own style of serving but they all do the basics. So if one server isn't your fit, then just nicely ask for a different style of server. I BELIEVE this is kind of True throughout the restaurant industry but if you want fast cocktails.... eat at the bar.... if you want to wine & dine & have someone manage your meal for you so you don't have to think much after a hard day's work... then sit in the dining area.   ALL in ALL this place is like your second kitchen. Fresh food so you can take leftovers & reheat it & it still tastes good. You can pretty much eat this place everyday & probably not get sick of it since I did it for 5 years.",

This time I had Kevin as my bartender but Katherine was behind the bar and said hi! Good for her for acknowledging. Back to Kevin, he was amazing and a keeper for your bar! He's pleasant, friendly and knows your menu!  Alcohol and food menu.  I applaud Kevin! This time I had a glass of Argyle Pinot Noir suggested by Kevin, it was a nice N smooth for the price. For Happy Hour I had the BR Cohn Cabernet Sauvignon. You save $5 pet glass for happy hour, 4:00/7:00. For my entree I had Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken (herb cheese, red peppers stuffed and a side of Cauliflower mashed potatoes and broccolini) DELISH!  I have to say what a delighted Experience this time. This is the way it normally is! Las Vegas Tommy Bahama is good.  Kevin K that is!!",

I think the best thing I honestly tasted from anyone's  plate were the fish tacos and a bite of cauliflower mash. My boyfriend had the ribs and they tasted like they were boiled and put in the oven with BBQ sauce on them. I had the ahi poke Napoleon which was so-so. Food was very very bland and not what I was expecting. The presentations were beautiful.",

We had the Korean chicken, tuna poke tacos, tuna poke on avocado, crab bisque, bunga salad. All were delicious and prepared and presented perfectly. We are impressed at the quality of the food and very reasonable prices. Service is incredible. We can't find one thing even average about this place. Great location, plenty of parking, top shelf shops all around. Definitely highly recommend. Also it's only a short mile from the crowded strip and very relaxing.",

Semi quiet setting with dimmed lighting with a single candle lit on your dining table. This is definitely the opposite of say, Yard House on the opposite side of this restaurant.  Besides their regular menu, they got a small selection of daily specials too. We started off with a small cup of crab bisque. That was on the daily special. If I wasn't so body conscious, I would have ordered a bigger bowl!!! O_O lol! This was delicious! Very flavorful and creamy. Perfect for a cool, autumn evening.   For entrees, my boyfriend got the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus) and I got the Crab Stuffed Shrimp (with Sauteed Spinach, Almond Rice, Thai Chili Sauce). See pics attached. We both enjoyed our dish a lot and would order this again. Good portion controls too. It was enough to get your comfortably full without making you feel like a fat lard walking out of the restaurant.",

Then I was surprised! Wow, I enjoyed Cinnamon Honey Butter a lot. I need to up my butter game.  The food was good. Considering how pricey Vegas is, I am so grateful for keeping the food prices reasonable. The gambling life can be hard on people especially when you get a bad beat. I ordered the burger w/ french fries. The burger was made medium rare. There were plenty of beef on the burger and everything tasted great. I tried some vegas food on the strip and it is just simply overpriced by a lot. Tommy Bahama delivered on high quality food while providing great services w/o emptying the bank account.",

The flatbread was purely delicious, the caramelized onions where great and the fresh arugula on top was just the perfect acid cut to the flatbread. My boyfriend had the coconut shrimp which he loved. Ate the whole plate in less then 10 mins. His dad, Parmesan chicken, which not going to lie, looked soooo good and comforting. Plate was basically licked clean! Mom had the Cuban sandwich, and his brother the chicken sandwiches. Both were HUGE. I had the chicken and mango salad, did not disappoint. Over all we all enjoyed everything brought to the table. So much so, we were there for over 2 hours oops. Thank you so much to our server Andrea (? I think sorry!) she was wonderful, informative, and made our overall experience pleasant. Will definitely be back in the future.",

The best items were the coconut shrimp, Thai curry and key lime pie. I would go there just to eat the key lime pie. So limey and refreshing and the graham cracker crust was perfection with the perfect amount of salt. YUM. The. Best. Ever. Nice big slice too enough for two to share.   Ambiance: really cute island feel. Made me feel like I'm on vacation in Hawaii or some tropical place.   Service: a little slow in checking in on us, but overall satisfactory. The waitress brought my daughter an extra amuse bouche, which was appreciated.   Location: conveniently located inside Town Square near the open green area.",

They have an awesome happy hour menu with $6 glasses of wine, $5 well drinks, and discounted fish tacos, coconut shrimp and more of their favorites!  Personally, I always love the coconut shrimp, the tangy slaw that comes with them is the perfect accompaniment for the shrimp and the remoulade they sit on! I also love the blackened fish tacos entree, especially the sweet plantains and pudding that come as a side!   If I am feeling like eating healthy, I also really enjoy the Grilled Chicken and Mango salad that comes with tomatoes, toasted macadamia nuts, dried blueberries and feta. The chicken is always sooo moist and cooked perfectly, probably one of the best pieces of grilled chicken I can recall having consistently at any restaurant!  Finally, what a fun signature touch to provide a complimentary post card when the bill is presented. You can fill out the post card to mail to anyone and they will take care of the postage and mail it out!!",

The coconut shrimp was good, not like the ones that are mostly breading/ fried the coating was light. I am not a huge fan of coconut shrimp because I don't like the sweet flavor but if you like coconut shrimp you'd enjoy this. The salad was amazing, very generous with the crab and I normally ask for dressing on the side since restaurants tend to over-dress but this vinaigrette was just right. I ended up taking about 2/3 of the salad home after having 2 of the shrimps. I do think it would be worth $20. Minus one star because the service was really slow even though they weren't too busy, maybe since this is a lounge-y atmosphere place in Town Square they don't serve like people need to go back to work.",

If I want to pay $17 for a cocktail there are a lot of places I can go to do that, and I won't be treated like trash at the same time. We came in after time at the nearby splash pad. 3 adults, 4 kids. The server (Zachary) treated us as if we were scourge of the earth. Was not interested in being kind to our children: had they been little jerks I could understand that, but these were 4 kids that were behaved- and we were sitting on the patio, not the dining room. As soon as we sat I ordered my drink + 2 sides of fries for the kids and water for all. Fries came out almost at the same time as the food, which defeated the purpose. Asked for extra ketchup and were treated like Zach had to go handpick the tomatoes himself. The food came out and some of the kids didn't get the paper umbrellas. We asked for a couple more to make it fair for all. Zachary says \"well we are kind of running low on those\". I responded, \"no, you're actually not\". It's literally an island themed restaurant. Those things are all over the back I guarantee it you're just trying to be rude to a little kid. Get over your weird power trip.  I went to the host stand and told them I'd like a new server, I was unhappy with the attitude of ours. Someone came by with extra umbrellas, but no one could be bothered to actually handle the real issues.  Zachary comes back but clearly would rather be somewhere else- and it this point so would we. We cut our dinner short and pack it up to leave. I ask for the bill to be split - so mine is split (he did it incorrectly) & then the other two ladies Bill was still combined. He didn't offer to go boxes and disappeared. I've been dining at TB for 15 years and I don't know if I'll be back. There are a LOT of places with happy hour in town (& at town square) and those places won't treat me as poorly.  Also, when a customer says they're having a poor experience, change the server. Apologize. I didn't want anything other than a new server, which I ASKED for. Instead I was treated like I was a problem by the host stand.",

Style - The food is American and Hawaiian Fusion, which is a nice blend of Asian flavors more suited to the American Palate.    2.  Ambiance - Very nice, relaxing setting, almost like resort style, with nice window views to the outside areas in Town Square. Very urban like.  3.  Service - Excellent! From the reception desk to the server, I found the service to be fun, relaxing, engaging, all at the right tempo / amount!  4.  Food -   Appetizers -   Had the Chicken Lollipop and this was pretty tasty with the Macadamia Nut and the Jerk dressing, although I am not a huge fan of the Jerk taste.  It is not as subtle to me in general. I love having the little drumstick lollipop style which is when they push the meat from the bottom to the top over the bone and it looks like a tootsie pop instead of a chicken drumette.    Also had the Coconut Shrimp and this was very tasty, tender and very nice sizes as well.    Seems that with all the appetizers, you can order in an entree size as well!  Food-   Thai Shrimp and Scallops - Very light flavoring of Curry, with shrimp and scallops over a small bed of rice. The scallops were amazing and the shrimp was fine, it was way overshadowed by the amazingly tender and succulent pieces of scallop....  Lemongrass Ahi Tuna - The tuna was very lightly seared and very raw, which made for a really nice delicate taste / flavor.  Served on a bed of rice with Bok Choy Vegetables. The Bok Choy was nearly perfect, just a bit under cooked for my taste.  However, I do prefer slightly under cooked to overcooked, so this was acceptable to me  5.  They also have private dining area and plenty of space to handle most requirements.  Could be great for business meetings, rent the whole restaurant and etc.  I like it.  GK says check it out and I am gonna go back there for the Kobe Burger......",

The staff did a great job handling staggered arrivals, varying courses (3 of us ordered from the four course Restaurant Week menu, 3 from the kids menu, etc.) Everything was going great until the main course was over. It took literally half an hour for dessert to come out and imagine how awkward it was to present three desserts as part of the Restaurant Week menus but nothing for the birthday girl. Our server scrambled to get to dessert tray and we ordered one for her. We all shared bites of the Restaurant Week desserts while we waited for hers to come out. I ended up leaving my credit card with the rest of the party because I had to get back to work after a lunch that took almost an hour and a half. It started out so well but fell so flat that I felt compelled to post this review. Go only if you aren't in a hurry and especially don't go if you are celebrating a special occasion.",

We had never been here so thought we'd finally give it a shot.    Fish tacos were the big standout of the happy hour menu.  These are the kind of tacos you imagine eating while vacationing at a beach resort.  I could've eaten 6 of them.  Ahi tuna was also good.  Judging by other patrons around us, the sliders were the most popular so we'll try that on a future visit.  Drinks were fruity and strong although none were too memorable (cause and effect?).    They also had a guy doing acoustic guitar renditions of songs by the likes of Van Morrison, Coldplay and the Chili Peppers.  I would've requested Stephen Bishop if we had stayed longer.",

We ate surprisingly little seafood, but if the crab-stuffed shrimp are any indicator of how good the seafood is - we'll need to go back for more! So yummy!  Save room for the key lime pie too!  It's also much more reasonably priced than on-strip restaurants. That's probably a no brainer, but it's nice to know.   Also loved the service. We were the last ones in there, but never felt rushed or pressured to hurry it up.",

This restaurant didn't have a wait and I wanted to try this place out since I've never ate here before. I ordered the Thai shrimp & scallops and I was very disappointed. It sounded good on the menu, but didn't taste as good as I thought it would. The scallops were undercooked and there wasn't enough curry sauce. The portion was small too and the price for this dish was $27. Definitely not worth that price. The drink I had was the pineapple paradisio which tasted way better than the food! They gave me a complimentary dessert which was the pineapple creme brulee that was actually in a real pineapple for my birthday which was delicious since I love creme brulee, but I'm not going to this restaurant for food again.",

There are two approaches to eating at Tommy Bahamas....Weight Gain or Weight Loss.    If you are looking to gain weight with their delicious rich and savory menu selection, I would start by eating the bread with ginger honey butter.  If you like sandwiches, the cuban sandwich is very rich and tasty.  I also recommend the Grilled bbq spare ribs.  Decadent.  Chicken Tortilla soup is also very tasty  If you are looking to lose or maintain weight, they have a pretty decent salad selection.  Ahi tuna with Kale and mushrooms is pretty solid.  So is the grilled chicken salad.    For those of you who are into libations, My wife loves the Grapefruit basil Martini.  Its a light drink that's not too sweet...perfect for a hot day.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch and I must say that place is nothing more than a glorified Chilis that specilaizes in fusion American/Hawaiian food. Mainly it taste like any other average American restaurant that happens to have Ahi tuna in a large number of their dishes. Despite my own inclination not to go with the special for lunch, I decided to go against my gut and get the \"Tuna Melt\" for lunch. I mean who doesn't want beer-battered avocado slices in their sandwich? Before any of you get on me, if you saw the menu, you'd see for yourself for the lack of eye catching items minus the fish tacos. Anyways, the food gets there and it looks like sandwich that came from Denny's. I must have not payed attention because the sandwich also came with two slices of thick bacon. Never have been a real fan of bacon and I have noticed in my foodie experience that places generally add bacon to dishes that lack any real flavor. Surprise, surprise: the sandwich tasted like nothing. The tuna was very fishy and was obviously not the freshest cut of fish available. It tasted like a very fishy chicken salad sandwich and also looked like one. If you are a huge fan of the aforementioned, you'd be in love. However, if the thought of a chicken salad sandwich ellicits a emesis response from your dopamine receptors like mine, then you will hate it. Fries...how can you mess this up. Shockingly, my fries were stale and cold and had something that resembled and tasted like Italian seasoning on it. Service, I wish I could say was on point, but our server looked pretty busy. No real rapport established besides for taking the order and refilling our waters. No recommendations. No small talk. Like dining at a  tropical themed McDonalds. The only great part of this experience was their Creme Brulee which housed in a pineapple. I could have eaten four of those. In summary, I would not recommend this place besides for the desserts and will not willingly go back here again. I've heard their happy hour is great so maybe I'll try that out in the future. *Mic drop.",

I really wanted to like this place, but $100 later..I was wishing I tried Brio or Kabuki.

We've had the \"real thing\", island cuisine that is, so we were a bit shy at trying anything that might be a knock off, but I actually enjoyed it.   We were seated right away, the bar had cozy booths that were available, and our server was also the bar keep. She took our drink and appetizers order right away, and the food was swift to come our way.   We had the crab cakes, which had a very beautiful presentation. The green and red sauces were sweet chili sauce and olive oil. Then on top of that was cole slaw with a vinegar dressing. Then two golden brown crab cakes stacked on that. I thought the crab cake was really good, I had big bites of crab which I love, and the sweet chili sauce made it zesty. I don't think my husband cared for this dish, his comments were \"it's too sweet\".   We also tried the fried goat cheese, with macadamia nuts and soy sauce glaze. I love the bold flavors. It was served over a bed of diced mango's. The cracker served with it was a little thin, since the goat cheese has pretty strong flavor a thicker wafer would be better.   We both tried the Cuban sandwich with fried yucca. The sandwich came cut on the diagonal and it was difficult to eat, as each bit I lost a little bit of the insides, the meat and pickles kept sliding off. The yucca fries were light golden brown, and had a very different texture, it looked like fries, but it was very soft when biting into the wedge. The texture was too much for me, so I gave most of my fries to my husband.   I did enjoy the meal, I thought the flavors were good, the service was excellent, as our server took good care of us, but I did feel it was a bit pricey.",

It's a little on the corporate side with it's ambiance, but the menu has a number of strong dishes.    I'll admit that walking in the place, I was a little dubious.  The restaurant houses one side of the building and the other side of the building sells tacky J. Crew-style Caribbean clothing.  Doesn't really sound like the best place to find a meal.  But after a few dishes, I was won over.    The tortilla soup was a huge winner with bright, fresh flavors and a nice spice.  Not over-the-top spiciness, but just enough to bring out the chicken and tomato flavors.  Coconut shrimp came across as fairly standard.  Not a real stand out dish, but I was impressed with the freshness of the shrimp.    Also had the Jerk Chicken.  To put it simply, it was perfectly cooked, tender, and nice balance of sweet and tangy.  I'm not the biggest fan of the atmosphere--a bit too much corporate in this bistro for me--but the flavors were very good and the dishes all fresh.  Thumbs up.",

The staff was polite and even with all of the guests they had to take care of, did really well at  making sure no one had to wait for food or go thirsty. Very efficient staff. I started with a Millionaires Mai Tai, which was very good, so I ended up getting a 2nd during dinner. I ordered a bowl of Crab Bisque, for the price (9.50) seemed like a small amount but it's very rich and think, so a cup would've been a better choice for me. It was very smooth and creamy, with a hint of crab taste. It was good but I don't think I'd get it again. For my meal I opted for the \"World Famous Coconut Shrimp\"(16.50) not sure why it's famous, I've had coconut shrimp elsewhere many times and this wasn't the best by far.The shrimp was cooked well, not greasy or anything, it was just not anything special, and the papaya mango chutney seemed too sweet to dip the shrimp in.  On a good not, My husband got the Cuban Sandwich (13.50)...wow! I would've never thought to order a Cuban somewhere like this, it was very good, a little messy but lots of flavor. We both agree we'd go back just for that! The staff was nice enough to let us bring our own cake, they cut it and served it as well.  Everyone had a good time, we sang Happy Birthday, ate cake and enjoyed good conversation in a pleasant setting.",

    "text": "Here for lunch. No line, no wait at all on a Wednesday afternoon. My second time at this location within the last year. It appears as though they changed up their menu a bit. Ordered the chicken lollipops (I think that's what it was called) for an appetizer and they were good. Wouldn't order again, too sweet for my liking. For my entree I had the kona coffee crusted ribeye. So good! (No taste of coffee whatsoever). Dish came with cauliflower mash and lemon arugula. The flavor was amazing! I recommend it. For dessert, I ordered their pineapple creme brulee. Very pretty dessert & tasty! Only bad thing about lunch was I wanted a lemonade and the server said they were all out! Smh disappointed but ok...he didn't recommend anything else to drink either. But besides that, service was good. Don't forget to ask for warm bread with your meal!",

My friend and I shared a chocolate cake dessert and the pina colada cake dessert while sitting on the patio.  Dessert and coffee was all we had, but it was a great experience.  It felt like being on vacation at this restaurant.  The service was also great.  A little bit slow, but overall a great evening experience.  I'm definitely going back to try their lunch or dinner menu items.",

I had several spoonfuls of it and even my date said he was burping it up after.  I had it worse. I ended up throwing it all up outside the restaurant around the corner by the perfectly, trimmed and manicured green bushes.  Thanks Tommy Bahama for ruining my first night in Vegas and instead of drinking away, I had to be drinking Pepto Bismo!",

With that being said, Tommy Bahamas was the go to choice for happy hour. From 4pm-7pm, they run a deal on six food options and maybe ten drink specials. The food runs from $5-$7 and the drinks from $6-$7.  I got the ahi poke, fish tacos, and a mojito. The poke is nothing spectacular. In fact, it is rather puny. The same goes for the macadamia goat cheese. The fish tacos are as amazing as Philip T. makes them out to be.",

    "text": "Super-cute little place, open, airy feel. Great decor. So tropically classy! A local friend of mine took me here for lunch as she also wanted to show me the awesome shopping area it is in. We skipped over a super fancy place and chose this one - fancy in its own right but 'Florida-feel casual' at the same time. Our waiter was really sweet - we got several wait staff helping us throughout our meal, actually. Some things took awhile like our waters and my coffee but overall, I liked our experience.  I tried the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent and served hot. YUM! Little bits of sweet corn came on top. My friend had ordered an appie and a main and I knew that would be a lot for me for lunch but what the hell - I also got the blackened fish tacos. They were good - of course they do not compare to say, some you would get in Hawaii but they were quite tasty. I could only eat 1 out of 3 of them. Also on the side of the plate in addition to a lime, you get a little pineapple yogurt type dessert in a taco shell with beautifully fried plantains on top. OMG, I left full and of course I took my tacos with me! My friend loved her lobster bisque as well as her chicken tacos and she too had a to-go bag! My one comment would be that we had asked for all the dishes to come at one time but my soup came first and nothing else. Not even my friend's soup came so I felt a bit bad eating alone for a bit. But we said nothing and tipped very well. Would love to go back next time I am in town, maybe for dinner sometime to see the mood of the restaurant at night.",

I didn't order a cocktail but I witnessed some other patrons sipping on drinks and they looked extremely delicious.  I also love sitting outside on a warm day and people watching.

My family and I decided to spend my birthday dinner there last minute and our service got off to a rough start with our initial server, perhaps she was having an off night..we all have them, but things weren't going so well and my father in-law ended up requesting another server as we had yet to have our orders taken or much else. The manager stepped in and was extremely accommodating (I didn't catch her name) and sent Adam to be our server for the evening. Adam was WONDERFUL and he really turned the experience around for us. I appreciated him taking on our group, especially knowing that we were a bit upset, and he treated us so kindly and was very attentive. We have dined here before and will definitely continue to in the future...requesting Adam, of course! He helped to make our evening special along with the management and that meant a lot to us. Of course, we enjoyed our food and being together, but Adam's service was really the best part of our meal.",
