We got 6 rib tips for $6.99 brisket and chicken quesadillas (4 slices of each) for $5.99 and the Georgia pull pork sliders for $1.49 each (we got 2). When I tell u we were full and SO SATISFIED!!!! The food was awesome!!! Even our waiter was great! Food and service was GREAT!! I can honestly say this BBQ IS TEXAN APPROVED and \"ballin' on a budget\" friendly!!",

Corn on the cob, fluffy cornbread, chicken, ribs, brisket, fries.... oh, there's no end to the deliciousness.   There are a variety of sauces on your table, from sweet to sassy, take the time to sample them all to find your favs.    And one of these days, i'll manage not to eat so much that I can't try a desert afterwards, because they look great as well  :-)",

I am from the South (Georgia)... so this restaurant feels just like home as I believe DAVE himself started his restaurants in Georgia.  Everything's great about this place from the food, to the friendly staff, to the decor. My suggestions (i.e. what I always end up ordering) are as follows: DRINK: Sweet Tea MEAT: Beef Brisket  I've tried their nachos and fried pickles appetizers and they are both great.  DESSERT: Their bread pudding is probably the best in the city  Side note: This is one of few places that offers their own BBQ sauces and they are all on your table and you can pick and choose whatever you like right there! I prefer \"Georgia Mustard\" and \"Sweet and Sassy\"... I just wish I could find that \"Georgia Mustard\" sauce in my local grocery stores because I've seen just about all their other sauces in the grocery store(s)",

There's the bar area to the left with what seems like a full bar and big screen TVs.  Main dining area in the middle, watch your fingers especially when their BBQ on them they might go missing.  And the To-go area to the right.  The best part of Famous Dave's is their food of course.  And there's that email for a mystery birthday gift, just signing up for their P.I.G. club online.  The email usually doesn't tell you want you get but you can anything from desserts to the all-american bbq feast.  Still haven't gotten the all-american bbq feast but I'll continue to try as long as they keep sending me the email.  I've had their hot fudge kahlua brownie talk about a dessert, yummy. Their wings are also really good especially when their dunked in that rich and sassy bbq sauce. Their BBQ ribs and brisket are good.",

For delivery the order needs to be a minimum of $150.00 so I called my order in for the All American Feast the day before and advised the staff I would pick up at 11:30 am  I arrived just after they opened at 11:00 am and went into the bar area where the waitress was very helpful. Within ten minutes my order was ready to go and they included paper plates and utensils  The lunch included a full slab of St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a whole Country-Roasted Chicken, 1/2 lb. of Texas beef brisket, creamy coleslaw, famous Dave fries, Wilbur beans, six pieces of fresh sweet corn and four Corn Bread Muffins. I added on to my order an additional two pints of sides - beans, slaw, 2 corn muffins and 6 cans of sodas. The food was put on a large tray with the exception of the sides which were packed efficiently. The food was a hit and tasty. Ribs were smoked and tender, brisket was yummy and chicken flavorful and moist. The sides were solid and the extra pints weren't even touched BC we had so much food. Actually the platter fed a total of 7 and was a great choice.  My clients were happy, since it's difficult for entire staff to get out of the office and I was able to secure some orders! I would definitely use Famous Dave's BBQ in the future for lunch to go.",

The order came, I was surprised how big the slab was. The ribs were warm, easy to cut.  We shared them because it was going to be too much for me. Our server came by and checked to see how the food was. She asked if we needed refills for the Arnold Palmers.   We also put in a to go order, It arrived about the time when we were ready to go. I would go back again.   Thanks Famous Dave's!",

My man and I were craving Famous Daves for about two weeks, we decided to go in on a Sunday.. young man (server) greeted us right when we walked in asked us if we wanted a booth or table we chose booth. We sat for about 25 min decided to wave down the manager Liz she never greeted us just asked if we knew what we wanted to drink she brought us our drinks we told her we were ready to order and she walked away 10 minutes later a lady by the name of Susan comes up to take our order still doesn't greet us and I have yet to see anyone smile but the gentleman that sat us. Our appetizer came with chips (witch we have had in the past) it didn't have enough chips so we mentioned it to the server she rolled her eyes and walked away? about five minutes later we asked for the manager the manger came and we explained how we didn't appreciate the service. The manager mentioned that my man had used the F word with the server when we asked for more chips crazy part is my man has never cursed once during our relationship so can you tell me where this F word came from?  I have never experienced such horrible service not to mention people who make up False accusations. I love Famous Dave's but I refuse to come back to this location.

I've been sat in the bar a few times, and hate it in there. I usually always get good service in the resturaunt so I have asked to be sat in there when the hostess starts heading to the bar. Last week the hostess didn't listen and insisted on seating my husband and I in the bar. The resturaunt side always has us in and out within 35 minutes. The bar takes forever, no matter who is bartending. This time in the bar it took us 1:15 to eat and get out of there. We ordered chicken and pork off their new meal deals. The food is already smoked/cooked, so why on earth it took almost 30 mins to get food is beyond me. After finishing our food and putting our napkins on our plates, it took another 10 mins for the bartender to ask us about dessert, 10 more mins to get dessert, and after those were finishes, 10 mins to get out check. After another 10 minutes, I ended up walking my check up to the bartender to run our card. The bartender wasn't even that friendly on top of it. It was like the people eating bothered her. She had about 4 customers at the bar and there were 2 other tables eating. Not even that busy. I also assume the bartender was some sort of manager the way she barked orders to the other staff. Take a word of advice and eat in the resturaunt unless you plan of spending the day there and getting crappy service... Go 15 mins west to the Flamingo location or go 15 mins East to Lucielle's.",

We typically get one or two of the following items, ribs, rib tips, sausage, brisket, chopped pork. All are quite good. I enjoy the ribs, because they are tender, but not necessarily \"fall off the bone\". Beware of the ribs and rib tips as they tend to be a bit fatty. All of the meats are very good. Excellent, no, but definitely good.   As for sides, we have tried the jalapeno mac and cheese, beans, fries, and potato salad. All are very good.   A few of the reviews point out sub-par service. We have always experienced good service at this location. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to really bother us either. I would return since the prices are reasonable, the food good, and it's close to home. I was undecided between 3 or 4 stars, but went with 4 stars due to the value.",

    "text": "I've never been here before and they keep springing up all over the city so I thought may as well give it a try. Walking in the decor was like any other chain restaurant, nothing special. I did like the bar area, had extra tables to eat at if you didn't feel like waiting in line and if you wanted to sit at the bar there weren't any video poker machines so you could actually sit at the bar and eat and drink without having the glare and screaming lights telling you that you too could get a royal flush.  The service was nothing short of excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly. Every server said hi, bye, smiled, quick, attentive, almost seemed like it was their first week and were trying to impress. Bartender even came around out of the bar to take more drink orders. Very strange but me likey.  Food? I see that they were voted Best of Las Vegas 2010, but I have to say I liked the barbecue at Lucille's better than the food here. Their signature wings were pretty good, definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings, meat wise anyways, the barbecue sauce was so so but still I will be going back for the wings.  As for everything else, I had the brisket, half a chicken, half a slab of ribs, the green beans, fires, baked beans, and garlic mashed potatoes.....don't judge me. The brisket was okay, I had to keep saucing it up, I would of rather had the tri tip at Lucille's. The chicken wasn't the half rotisserie chicken I was expecting, it was more like a pigeon leg but... it was decently flavored. The ribs were good, nothing to write home about but good enough. The sides though? I'd pass, nothing really stood out and I actually didn't finish them. The service was good but the food was just not as good as Lucille's or even close to the barbecue down South. But would I go back? Absolutely, but probably just for the wings and a beer.",

After dousing them with 21/2 packets of sauce it wasn't bad. The sauce was good but the sides weren't anything special. I can get the same at walmart. For the $ price I would go someplace else. $20 for everything. I guess the que for 2 would've been better. It will be long time before I come back.",

WAYYYYYY too much food!!!  Not a complaint just make sure you bring a big appetite.  Fries were great, pulled pork was amazing, ribs were also good.  Chicken was good too.  Only thing I could say is I wish the hot sauce was hotter, the \"Devil's Spit\" which is the hottest they have was pretty mild in my opinion.  Highly recommended, good food, fun service.",

My suggestion, stick to the ribs. The sides are typical. The colesaw and mac and cheese are really good. I always get my food to go, so my review is for the food only. I usually order form the to go counter and one time I waited at the bar and had a beer. The bartender was nice but she made it a point to tell me that I could order to-go food from her. I mean, she is a bartender she has her own customers at the bar. The person that works the take out counter relies on take out orders only. It was a little selfish of her to try to take business from her fellow staff member. It was a little annoying. Other than that, the ribs rock!!!!",

    "text": "Mid 70's weather outside on the patio, 5 different bbq sauces, and well cooked meats among friends.... what more can you ask for?  Been driving by this place for a while now and finally had a chance to suggest it as we couldnt figure out what to chomp on for the evening. Rolled in dinner time about 6-7pm and it wasnt terribly busy, the patio was open and the weather was hard to beat so sat outside. We were greeted by (forgot her name) our waitress who was on point all night and very friendly which i think really helps make a meal and the experience of eating out. After placing our order for 5 consisting up several two meat combos and then my own meal of the \"man handler\"  excuse the name but it sounded good on the menu, a sandwich made with brisket, and sausage chopped up with pickles and i added coleslaw to the top, also came with a side which i chose to be the mac n cheese. The assortment of sweet, spicy, tangy, etc sauces was a good variety as there is something for everybody. My sandwich was tasty as the meat was cooked well and the coleslaw actually was a nice extra to have on this particular concoction. And the mac n cheese with bits of corn in it was on point but $10 for a sandwich was kinda enn.. although good i would like liked to have either fries or a second side for $10. Everybody else seemed to enjoy their food also at my table which isnt easy to do with a decent mixed bunch as we were. Will i come back? Sure maybe to try out this happy hour that i just read up on Arron M.'s review as i like the food but for the regular price i think id rather eat something more filling so if there are specials then count me in that day. Money is tight these days so im trying to cut where i can...damn i feel like a pig because the sandwich didnt fill me up.. weak.",

    "text": "Trust this review from a past Texas barbeque pit master.  The first thing you should notice about a barbeque restaurant is the intoxicating, salivating-producing aroma of barbecue as you pull into the parking lot.  This sensation is absent from Famous Daves, even when you walk through the doors.  For the following reasons I actually believe this faux barbeque is prepared in ovens.  The ribs and the \"authentic Texas\" brisket did not have a single sumptuous bit of bark on the surface and also did not have a single bit of smoked flavor. The bark on the chopped pork was better but equally tasteless having been produced in an oven.  About the sides:  The corn on the cob was severely overcooked and mushy.  When you pull the paper away from the cornbread muffin half of the muffin comes away with it.  The green beans were almost raw, so they did not take up any of the bacon, garlic, onion and red pepper.  The supposed four cheese macaroni and cheese was mostly Velveeta.  The potato salad was simple and good and the Wilbur beans were tasty.    With all this in mind I have to question why Yelpers and Best of Las Vegas reviewers rate this mess of a restaurant so high.  Not being a hater, but I suspect that it has to do with the size of their waists.  I swear, I felt I on the deck of the spaceship in Walley when I sat in there.",

    "text": "The service is wonderful, and the employees are friendly. Tonight one of the servers at the Blue Diamond location in Las Vegas took it upon himself to completely disrespect me and my wife. The waiter was of African American origins like me. He was constantly flirting with my wife behind my back. I was unaware of this until my wife; Tammy brought it to my attention. He was standing in the background constantly staring and making flirtatious smiles and gestures at my wife. I understand that people flirt but there is a line and he crossed it. This made her extremely uncomfortable. He went so far as to follow her AND my three year old son to the bathroom and made a very disrespectful comment. \"Hey, cutie! And I wasn't talking about the baby!\" That was totally uncalled for. Our night was ruined. As a husband my first thought was to confront him. Instead I kept my cool and am writing this email in hopes that you will address the situation. When we got home my wife called the manager of the Blue Diamond location to address the situation. The entire time she was talking to the manager, Kevin, he was laughing under his voice and completely refused to take this matter seriously. He even stated that he was not sure how to handle this type of situation. Kevin told my wife that the waiter's name is \"Essex.\" Given Kevin's demeanor at the time of the conversation we are unsure whether or not that is his real name. My wife even told me that he was the same waiter that kept walking past our table last year staring at her and our 11 year old daughter.   As it stands my family and I will never dine at that location again and will suggest to others not do so as well. Essex is clearly there to pick up on women whenever he can and is not there to work. Your manager, Kevin showed is ineptitude when dealing with this situation. Please make no mistake. I am not out to gain anything from this but we are considering seeking legal actions on the grounds of sexual harassment and stalking so no other family should have to endure the same vulgar and disrespectful treatment. We are also going to contact our local news stations and hope they will not make light of this situation and warn the people about that location. I love my family and do not want to see other families put in comprising situations like this. Famous Dave's used to be a place for families to relax and enjoy themselves. Now it is becoming a haven for potential sexual predators. Our waiter, Ryan was great. He should be commended for his excellent service. It is people like \"Essex\" who make the hard workers look bad.   I hope you will take what I writing seriously and address this situation but as of right now, we will never set foot in another Famous Dave's BBQ again. Please do not let this happen to another family.",

Comes with ribs, chicken, and brisket or pulled pork, with 2 big sides and cornbread muffins.  Oh, and the fries, that are scattered all over the lid. My god, ALL of the food was good.  The ribs, were delicious fall off the bone, variety, the pulled pork was amazing (I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch one time as well).  I love the different kinds of bbq sauce.  Their desserts are actually pretty friggin' good as well.  Their bread pudding is diabetic shock, but it's absolutely delicious.  The prices, really aren't that bad, either.  It's about $60 for one of the Feasts, and it really does serve about 5 people.   I've been here 3 times now, and will definitely come back again.",

Usually we would go do the BBQ at Ellis Island, but we were in the mood to try something different today.   We walked in and were seated at a booth pretty quickly. We checked out the menus and decided on a couple of dishes and an appetizer. I was also going to take advantage of those happy hour prices for a nice cold adult beverage or three.  We were just waiting for the server to come and take our drink order to kick things off.  The thing is we waited...  ...and waited...  ...and waited...  ...and waited...  To add insult to injury, people who came in after us were seated and served their drinks. AND on top of that, two different employees looked right at us, turned around, and walked away. At the 34 minute mark we decided to throw in the towel. It wasn't even that busy as there were plenty of empty tables and booths everywhere! I went to tell the hostess, in a very calm manner, on the way out the door  that we had been waiting 34 minutes and no one had even taken our drink order. There was no apology, no explanation....no...anything. I just got the deer in the headlights look. Nice.   Cross this place off my list. I'll just go back to Rolling Smoke or Ellis Island...or anywhere else for that matter when I'm in the mood for BBQ.  Welcome to the Hall of Shame.  Disgraceful.  1 star.",

    "text": "Famous Dave's was a favorite of my boyfriend, and I was quite excited to see what the excitement was about. The restaurant is spacious with booths and family dining tables tastefully decorated in a hunting motif. The wooden tables and walls gives for a nice ambiance for good eatin'! Like most bbq restaurants you have more options than you can choose from, for me it's always the 2 meat with 2 sides. It's necessary for me to always have one of the meat choices be ribs. I love ribs. Pork and beef alike, I don't discriminate when it comes to red meat. I am a believer. The first thing to come to the table was their famous bread pudding.. As my boyfriend MUST always eat dessert first, I have the opportunity to know if I need to leave room for my own after dinner. The bread pudding is so good that he won't order any other option. The bowl it's served in could hold a King size portion of linguini pasta. The dessert itself is beautiful, the way it glistens it what looks like candied pecans and fun juice. Slipping down the side was a nice size scoop of old fashion vanilla ice cream; which you need. This dessert isn't for someone who can not appreciate sugar. It was pretty dang good, I could only handle a bite, but my photo will show you that was not the case for my boyfriend. I ordered ribs and a hot link with a side of green beans (small bacon pieces thru out), spicy macaroni and cheese, then of course I paid the extra for the loaded baked potato. Because what's BBQ without a baked potato? It came with a delightfully sweet corn bread muffin and a thick slice of white bread. Famous Dave's have a few sauce options on the table and they definitely have more variety then most. I tend to like the more spicy of the sauces.  The ribs though... Wow.. I was very impressed by the cut of meat. It started a conversation, and a failed Google search attempt, to find out where they purchase their meat. That good. The rib was seasoned slightly leaving a ton of room for me to taste the beautiful taste of meat. It was thick and meaty.. It was purrfect. I highly recommend Famous Dave's for a couple, group of friends, or family. You can't go wrong. It's good enough to keep the table quiet, while everyone licks and devours what fun deliciousness is in front of them. By the way, their was a separate bar area that looked fully stocked with top shelf liquor and happy partons.",

When i got there 15 mins later, the order wasnt ready yet.  Waited an additional 15 minutes before it wasx ready.  It wasnt that busy either.  I should have checked before i left.  Well they forgot the cornbread, and the beef brisket tasted like a chew toy.  The soup was OK but nothing home to write about.  Now i know why its been almost a year since we last went here.  When i called to talk to manager, he only offered to originally provide the 3 cornbread on my next visit.  I told him im not ordering here ever again, so he then offered to refund half my order.  Never will we go here again.  Tip- check your to go order before you leave.",

They've replaced their Mac and Cheese with Kraft Mac and have ditched the Wilbur Fries for soggy seasoned steak fries.  Worst of all I ordered a nachos to go the other day and there were parts of a plastic bag in it! Yup went to take a bite and pulled a plastic bag out of my mouth. Looks like it was from a bag they get their chili or pulled chicken in. Chef cuts the bag open to heat and doesn't bother to get the cut piece out of the pot!!! If this is how this establishment cares about food service or quality I hope they get shut down.",

When the food finally came, fiancee asked for a side of sauce lady said she would go and get it. She left and came back no sauce by that time we were so frustrated we left. When she saw our upset faces she asked her the gentlemen helping her to get it by then we were out the door. And when we came home the order had no muffin in it. So I wonder what took so long to get our order?",

Most of us ordered ribs, and they were a hit. the ribs came with 2 sides AND a piece of corn and a corn bread (lots of food for sure). I had the combo of ribs and chopped pork that was sooo tasty. The ribs are not super over sauced. However they have about 5 different sauces at each table from mild to \"diablo\" for everyones taste. So if you want to add more sauce...go crazy. My MIL had the turkey burger and also enjoyed it...so its more than just BBQ.    Everything everyone had here was good...from the sweet tea to the ribs, DEEELISH",

    "text": "I have absolutely no idea why people love Famous Dave's so much in Las Vegas.  There's really little to love, as nothing I had was executed properly.  Dry and flavorless meat (the ribs are hilariously awful).  Sides that were not real exciting.  The people working there are nice, and the cornbread is ok, which is why I'm not giving them one star.   For entertainment value it might be worth going here so you can see huge platters of saturated fat being devoured by people who care nothing about what they shovel in their gullets.  The one particular time I was there, my husband and I were fascinated by two large people eating one of the biggest platters of meat I have ever seen, more than I've seen in any casino buffet.   Am I a BBQ snob?  No, because if you read Raymond B's review, Famous Dave is supposed to satisfy these people.  I just really really want to have better BBQ than I can make at home.  But sadly, Famous Dave's, Memphis, Lucille's, and TC's Rib Crib have all been completely disappointing.   I don't know what it is about this city and BBQ - we have probably the best selection of restaurants in the entire world, but we have no good BBQ that I have found.  I've had better ribs and BBQ in Washington State, even in a town of 12,000, and WA is more known for its seafood than anything.  So bottom line, I have not found good BBQ anywhere in this town, and this restaurant continues this trend.  If you absolutely have to have fatty meat with loads of sauce which isn't that good, this is a great place to go.  If you want real, scrumptious, smoked meat which has been carefully tended to, I have no idea where to go, and I would love to find out.",

The meat is always tender and slides right off the  bone and the 6(?) choices of BBQ sauce to eat on your meat are all equally great.  My favorite is sweet and zesty.  I've tried the Georgia chopped pork and rib tips here and the flavors are just exquisite.  The average price of a dinner is about $11-$12 and they make sure you leave good and full.    The meal I usually get is a BBQ combo. It includes: Your choice of meat, your choice of two sides (I love the jalapeno corn man n cheese and the garlic redskin mashed potatoes), a cornbread muffin, and a corn on the cob FOR ONLY $10.99!!!    You can't beat all that food and all that flavor for such a great price.  Check out the picture I posted and I'm sure you'll be runnin out the door   :]",

    "text": "We have been coming here for many years now. At first it started out great, with amazing service and really great servers. A few years back they got a new general manager in and we had two trips that were just atrocious (one trip involved the manager herself who was beyond rude to us) so we stopped coming for awhile. Last year we started coming back and have had the best service every time. A few weeks ago we had server Michael (a very happy young black gentleman) around 7pm and he was absolutely spot on!! He had the biggest smile and was genuinely interested in our dining experience right through to the check, not just a forced politeness like many servers. Even when he was ridiculously busy with several tables he checked on us with lightning speed. If he had his hands full he would STILL pause and say I'll be right back with those cocktails for you folks, just to keep us updated that they were on the way. So many restaurants you wait and wait and don't know if they forgot about you, were just busy, or what the deal was, so this was really refreshing! What impressed me the most was soda refills without us ever saying a word, offers for replacement alcoholic beverages, and the fact that every single time he went back towards the kitchen he grabbed empty plates or glasses from our table or his other tables. I watch so many servers who mosey along and perhaps check in with their table but never clear it, leaving everything to the busers. He not only ran around bringing all this orders out to the tables, but you could see he was sizing up drinks and plates every time he went back too. We were in and out within a half hour. I cannot thank him enough for the excellent service. We tipped him well and want to recommend everyone ask to be seated with him if he is working. Our food was super speedy from the kitchen and everything prepared just as ordered. Great job Famous Dave's! =)",

    "text": "We stopped here for lunch yesterday (8/23/14).  We were seated in a booth, and waited for our server.  After about 10 minutes, a young woman came by and said \"I'll be right back\".  Then she proceeded to go to the hostess stand, look at something, stand there awhile; when the hostess came back, she started a conversation with her - and never even acknowledging us again.  Not even a glass of water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for something to happen (and they were not crowded, there were only about 10-12 tables filled in the entire restaurant).  Finally, since she decided her conversation was more important, we left.  She saw us leave (after all, she was conversing with the hostess) and didn't even apologize.  There is no excuse for bad service in ANY restaurant.  Guess there wasn't a manager on duty to monitor.",

    "text": "In every culture, the basic instinct to throw meat over an open or indirect fire is fundamentally ingrained in all. There is something delicious about the char-grilled flavor and marks that have us crawling back for more.  I do not know what style of BBQ this is. Is it Memphis, Kansas City, Carolina, or Texas style? I am not sure, but it is appetizing. The variety of sauces are different in their own way. There is nothing more disappointing than getting ready to try all the sauces to and finding out that they do not have much distinction. My favorite is the Wilbur's Revenge. It gets some brownie points for references to a childhood classic, Charlotte's Web. This is their spiciest and it does not hit you until the aftertaste.  I was not hungry, but my dining buddy was ravenous, so we got the Dave's Sassy BBQ salad and an order of 12 boneless wings. I know, who goes to a BBQ joint and orders a salad. I would have agreed with everyone who makes this statement, but there is something irresistible about this one. For being a basic greens salad, we opted for the pulled pork and then smothered it in the Wilbur's revenge made it thoroughly enjoyable. Normally, I shy away from over dressing a salad, but not here. BBQ sauce might be my kryptonite. The boneless wings are nothing special, just your run of the mill variety. For the $10, you are paying roughly the same price as Buffalo Wild Wings on Boneless Thursday. If you are dining on any other day of the week, it is a good deal. If you want more options on sauces then go on Thursday to BWW.  The prices are cheaper than Lucille's, but I will wait until I try their ribs before I start comparing. Two meats, two sides, and corn bread at Dave's cost about $10 dollars less than their competitor.",

The brisket use to be absolutely delicious but now when you order the brisket you get three/four pieces of brisket with a glob of small pieces of shredded brisket intermixed with a lot of fat, and which appears to have been cooking on the bottom of the pot for quite a while.  The brisket as well as the chicken are no longer cooked in the delightful sauce it use to once be cooked in.   I sent my dinner back and so did the person I was with.   It's not worth the money they charge for it.  Just be aware that the great dinner you once enjoyed is no longer available unless you send your dinner back and ask for what you thought you were paying for.    On the upside the service was great.  Both the manager and my server were polite, attentive and truly sorry that the menu had changed seeing our disappointment.    Seeing that Famous Dave's is pinching pennies at your expense try John Mull's Road Kill Grill.  You get 3x as much food for the same price and the food is excellent.",

I arrived just in time this afternoon to grab their Early Bird dinner special and got a combo with the St. Louis ribs, traditional wings with Pineapple Rage sauce, and a side of Wilbur beans. I've been here quite a few times but this was the first time I tried their award winning ribs (I love pulled pork waaaay to much). The ribs were almost fall off the bone tender and not dried out. I did need to add a bit more of the Sweet and Zesty sauce though.  The wings were another new try for me, and while the wings themselves were alright, the Pineapple Rage was all pineapple and no rage. I needed to slather it in Devil's Spit sauce to up the heat a bit.  Wilbur beans are my usual side. The meat chunks are a nice touch but I worry about the sugar content because they're usually so sweet.  As far as chains go, Dave's is alright. I'll keep going I suppose until I find a more \"local\" bbq place.",

The sides wow amazing i love the corn bread muffin that's usually demolished with the 1st 2 mins of me getting my plate and the beans are yummy.   I always order their sweet tea to wash done my delicious meal.

    "text": "Very unhappy with how difficult it is to seat four people. We walk in being the only people at the front. The restaurant wasn't even busy and there were plenty of tables to choose from. The first table offered to us was in a high traffic area and we asked if we could not sit by the front door. (We asked nicely) So, instead of seating us a couple tables back, they decide to have us wait and seat three families before us. One of the families they place in the far back and another family was seated up front. We asked the hostesses why they didn't sit us at that table and they say, \"we thought you wanted to sit in the back?\" We did not say that. And EVEN if we did, why didn't they sit us in the back where they sat a family bigger than ours? Now mind you while all this was happening, we were also holding a baby in our arms while waiting. This literally took them 20min to figure out this difficult job. I've worked in this field myself and let me tell you it's not rocket science. Once we got our table we see the hostesses telling what looked like the manager, the manager laughing it off and nothing said to us. VERY unprofessional. I will say I've been to this restaurant many times and the servers are always nice. The only reason they are getting two stars is because the food was good and waitress was attentive. I just don't think it should take TWO hostesses to take forever trying to solve whatever problem there was. If you need advice, here it is. If a family asks to sit at a different table, find it and have them take a seat. Don't have them wait while you help others. We should've left and ate somewhere else.",

    "text": "Came here for my husbands graduation. There were 9 of us and we were seated quickly once our whole party was there. We ordered 2 All American BBQ feasts. Each came with a full rack of ribs, a whole roasted chicken, Cole slaw, baked beans, potato wedges, 4 corn muffins, 4 corn on the cob and a choice of brisket, pulled pork, or hot links.   I'm not much of a meat eater but the guys in our group seemed to enjoy it, I know my husband did. I personally liked the ribs and corn bread, everything else was okay.   We had Chris as our waiter, he was very nice. Only, we sat there for a good two hours and he didn't fill our water cups once.   I paid $140+ for our meal and had some leftovers as well to take home. Not a bad price but I can think of other places to bring a big group (hubby just really wanted BBQ). Their happy hour is pretty good, I would come back for that.",

First of all it took forever for our food to come out. When it finally came out my loaded baked potato tasted like it had plastic in it. The cheese wasn't even melted, it was just some shredded cold cheese on top of a potato that was cold on the top and hot at the bottom. The server was rushy and unapologetic. The lemonade was gross and the Sierra Mist was flat. The salmon was rubbery and really fishy. The ribs were very pale and just disgusting in taste. On top of all of this one of the workers SWEPT THE FLOOR WHILE WE WERE EATING!!!!!!!! That itself was unsanitary especially when she was sweeping it towards us and I could see the particles go up in the air. I will never eat here again nor would I ever recommend anyone to. Smh",

I have been to MANY Famous Dave's restaurants all over Las Vegas, but this time, it wasn't good at all...   I ordered the Grilled Salmon (8 oz) and I hated eating it because with every bite I could taste the freezer lol. I drenched it with a LOT of sauce! My Fiance had to order a new Texas Beef Brisket because the first order wasn't good to him. His second plate, he says was much better. The servers and manager were always there, if we needed them, so that's why I give them 3 stars.   The sides were great and never had any bad feelings toward them. Definitely the corn bread muffins!!

    "text": "Take Out Service: Apathetic, unconcerned, & with no basic understanding of the concept \"sense of urgency.\" I deliver for Postmates part time after my day job and have for over 2 years. I've done over 750 deliveries and in that time this is the first instance I've felt it necessary to leave a negative review. At the takeaway counter when I show up for a prepaid delivery, I often have to wait the entire time it would normally take to place an order and have them prepare it. For example, I work in the same shopping center for my day job and when I place an order here they often say it'll be ready in 10 minutes. I walk over in 10 minutes and it's ready. When I take a Postmates run, I usually show up around 10 minutes(drive time) later, walk in, and they say it should be ready in a couple minutes. Then, 15 minutes later, they bring the food out still not packaged and still not ready to go. The whole process is infuriating. A prepaid order should be ready when the driver gets there. Literally every other restaurant understands this basic concept. Another example: I show up and again they say it should just take a couple minutes. They explain to me another driver took a same order meant to be delivered to the same person and never delivered it. 10 minutes go by and they come out and ask if I could contact the customer because they ran out of rib tips. The same rib tips that made it into the original order. They couldn't have told me that 10 minutes earlier!? They have no concept that, for drivers, time means money and wasted time is deliveries and money lost. Now, most of this could be excused if there was an overflow of orders or if they were extremely busy in the dining room. They are not. For tonight's example they had maybe two tables sat and one party of two at the bar. It's probably no wonder the place is a ghost town during the dinner hours. Perhaps the regular dining crowd has already gotten hip to the over the top lackadaisical service provided here. Drivers beware! Save yourself time and frustration and skip this Famous Dave's. You'll get another better run(or two) I'm sure of it.",

The service  was slow, I'm not sure why, there weren't many people. Our meals were not at all good. I ordered Dave's Sassy BBQ salad opting for brisket for the meat choice. The brisket was thin, dry and cold. Also ordered was a combo with meal with sausage link and brisket, again the brisket was cold and dry. When we brought it to the server's attention she tried to tell this wasn't the case because she meet just came out of the oven. That as it may be, it was substandard. Famous Dave's brisket is our favorite. I was really looking forward to a nice meal.  I guess it wasn't in the cards today.",

Their lunch specials are priced nicely and that is one of the main reasons I eat there. Service is okay, nothing stellar. The food itself is also okay. Hailing originally from Tennessee and having the pleasure of eating BBQ there has somewhat spoiled me and Dave's doesn't live up to TN BBQ. It's not bad though, definitely doable.",

We weren't so hungry that we felt like pigging out so we ordered the two item special, added another side dish to it, and split the entire thing. They need to put more two person specials on the menu. The 2 for 2 isn't they anymore but I heard another table ask and was able to order it anyway. Ask questions about the side dishes. I must have missed in on the menu but they had two types of Mac and Cheese, one with jalapeno peppers. What a terrible addition to Mac and Cheese. When we asked about it they switched it for \"standard\" without a problem. No complaints at all about the service - first class every step of the way and always with a smile. The total was about $30 so they're not inexpensive. Although it doesn't have the outstanding taste of an outdoor BBQ with the the family recipe, their BBQ beef is always tender and delicious. I'll keep looking for the genuine BBQ taste, but until I find it we'll keep coming back.",

    "text": "***My 100th review***  I LOVE bbq, so when my bf suggested we go to Famous Dave's for dinner Halloween night, I was game! Because it was Halloween, there was no wait and we were seated right away. We decided on the feast for 2, priced at $39.99 and comes with a LOT of food. Half a rack of spare ribs, half a chicken, and your choice of either pulled pork or brisket, we chose pork, corn on the cob, cornbread muffins, potato wedges and 2 sides, we chose beans and mac and cheese. The food came out within 15 minutes and I was surprised at how much food there was! We happily dug in.  My favorite item I had was the ribs. They were perfectly smoked and tender and the meat was almost falling off the bone. The chicken and pulled pork were tasty as well. The beans had pieces of bacon in them and were delicious. The mac and cheese had corn and jalapenos mixed in, which was different but good. I really like the different bbq sauces they have sitting at the table for you to use with your meal. They have 5 of them from sweet to inferno spicy. My favorite is the Georgia Mustard, its a vinegary sauce and its tangy and delicious on the different meats. We didn't even come close to finishing everything and had plenty to take home for the next day. Our server was awesome, I forgot his name but he was attentive and friendly. I would most definitely recommend this place, and will be back in the future, especially for the feast for 2.",

We chopped on the sampler app and the meat just seemed mediocre. It didn't seem to have any special spicy love in it. Maybe I'm not the BBQ type... maybe I'm spoiled from my grandfather bbq cooking.. or maybe it just wasn't that good.   The only thing I enjoyed was the happy hour special that begins at 9pm which was the wings and fries. Can't beat that price. Even then I've had better wings. Which my favorite are from outback.   Customer service was good. restaurant was clean. Prices are reasonable. Decor is adorable. Food,.. meh. I want some finger licking spicy tangy goodness and this just did not do it for me.",

It includes six ribs, half a chicken, and a third meat. We chose the brisket. Excellent choice! Delish! The ribs were once again outstanding - fall off the bone good. For our sides we chose the potato salad and the steak fries. Excellent sides for this meal. Much more food than we could finish. All for $24.

I was there with 8 family members.  I ordered chicken and brisket.  The server was kind enough to ask if I wanted white meat or dark.  I said I would prefer the white meat.   Service was a little slow, but that was understandable with a large party on a Friday night.  Our server was very professional and did a good job.  However when my meal arrived, it was brisket and a leg and thigh of the chicken.  I didn't  want to make a fuss, since I was there with a large group.   Then I tried to eat the brisket.  It was the very worst brisket I've ever tried to eat.  It was a blend of pure fat and meat so charred, it could be used as charcoal.    I can definitely recommend this as a place to avoid!",

Nothing bothers me more at a restaurant than a long wait when the place is dead.  I totally understand if service lags when the place is hopping, but not when it's quiet.  My last two time I've been here I got the same service.  Took a while to be seated and once seated, took forever to take my order.  Once you get your order in, the food doesn't take too long. So, you can't blame the cooks.  However, my bill arrived about 5 minutes after I got my food.  Talk about poor service. Take forever to seat you and get your order, but can't wait to kick you out.  This wasn't a one off thing.  Happened my last two visits here.  I would give this place less stars, but my belly left satisfied everytime.   My Favorites Here.  -Beef Briskets -Ribs -Corn Bread",

We always leave stuffed and enough leftovers for the next days lunch!!  I would call that a good value.  They had a new sauce last time I went, Ghost Chili BBQ sauce.  Very spicy, but oh so delicious!!  This sauce alone warrants a visit.   The food is consistent, always done well.  Our waiter Dave was on point.  Did a great job refilling drinks and making sure we were doing well.    In my opinion, whatever you order, you won't be disappointed.

With me not indulging in ribs we opted for extra chicken instead. Sides included Corn on the Cob. Coleslaw and Potato Wedges. Grilled Pineapple Slices. Also, we got Cornbread Muffins. To drink we ordered a Margarita, Strawberry Lemonade and a Tall Ale. Our total came to $62.48. Not bad at all for a dinner of three, with a delicious bag of leftovers to take home. The Chicken was moist with a nice smoky flavor. So was the Brisket. The Coleslaw was cut into little pieces, this brought out the various flavors quite well. Cornbread was sweet but cooked just a little over for my taste. The Corn was average. Potato Wedges came out of the kitchen cooked just right and lightly salted. Delicious!!! The service was excellent yet unobtrusive. Just the way I like it.",

Reservations were made for 6 pm on December 31. Upon arrival we were escorted into a back room where the temperature setting was at 59 degrees. Our waiter came over to the table with this greeting. Hi folks just want to let you know you WILL NOT get your food order until 1hr AFTER your order is placed. We asked why the answer was well we are very busy with take out orders. We said it's freezing back here can you turn up the heat. He told us no but he'll get the manager. The manager came into this freezer they call a dining room adjusted the temperature on the thermostat then walked out. Needless to say the heat never came up. After the order was placed we were brought our ice cold drink order and was told OH THE MUFFINS WONT COME OUT WITH YOUR MEAL THEY'RE BEING MADE. WE RAN OUT.  At this point our hands and noses were frozen and we were frustrated and my daughter got up to look for the manager. He was busy somewhere and after looking for him she went right into the kitchen to find him. The kitchen was a DIRTY DISASTER and in disgust she walked out. Finally the waiter came  into our freezing room and brought 2 little plates of chips. Your order should be ready soon he said. We were so cold our teeth were chattering finally MUFFINS. NOT 11 muffins but 4 muffins. Are you kidding us. The waiter was counting that 4 dinners should only get muffins. After screaming WHAT THE HELL the manager came out with muffins for us all and dinner made its appearance. By the time it was brought to us the room temperature managed to cool it off and it was barely edible. We left and I came home and wrote a complaint to the home office who apologized profusely. I was asked for my home number because someone would get in touch with me. THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. PROMISES TO CALL WERE NEVER KEPT. PROMISES THAT I WOULD HEAR FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER BUT NEVER DID. PROMISED A FOLLOW UP - NO ONE ATTEMPTED !!!  Same service we received ON New Year's Eve which was HORRIFIC and has continued to be a habit. Lots of lip service and NOTHING DONE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BBQ FOOD WE SUGGEST YOU LOOK FURTHER. HOW FAMOUS DAVES GOOD T THEIR NAME IS FOR BAD SERVICE. THEY WILL FOREVER BE FAMOUS FOR THAT.   January 19.2019 Still no call from corporate. These people are FAMOUS for being rude and disrespectful.",

    "text": "Honestly I'm from the south so this is kind of a cultural faux pas to eat at famous Dave's... but when you're hungry...your hungry !   I came her last weekend after a long day of setting up for a Vaccine clinic. I wanted MEAT! Juicy, tender, hot MEAT. I was disappointed  when I encountered poor customer service, semi warm appetizers and mediocre entrees.   I sat down with my two brothers and we ordered two of the red tip appetizers. We were dying and I knew that I would eat onion straws and they would get the majority of the rib tips. It wasn't that busy but the waitress took forever to come and take our order. When she finally took her order she forgot to ask for drinks and then about 10 minutes later he came back with our rib tips and no beverages. We kindly gave her our beverages and chow down on our food. The rib tips were juicy and tender and have the right amount of barbecue sauce on them. The only problem was they were somewhere warm. So I'm not sure if they forgot them and she didn't bring them to our table in time.   About 10 minutes after that she kindly came to clear our table and take our order. Of course I ordered the two meat combo. I asked for the ribs which weren't included and the chop pork. They were kind enough to oblige my requests. My two brothers ordered burgers which are pretty simple and unassuming. We waited and waited, and waited and waited, and waited and waited, and waited some more. A good 25 minutes had to gone bybye of us in deep conversation before the meal finally arrived. My meal was incorrect. I did not get my ribs, forgot my salad and never brought out my corn muffin. No big deal those are easy fixes. My brothers burger was well done when he asked for medium rare and his fries were cold. We were so hungry at this point we just chowed down on the food not really caring. The waitress again nicely came to clear a table and give us the check. I requested that she can leave a check specifically because I was treating my brothers. When she came to bring the check back she needs it directly to my eldest brother. In my personal opinion a waitress or waiter should listen to requests. Especially with managing money. I paid gladly and after she came back to pick up the receipt she then asked \" oh no do you want dessert?\"  I don't really need to say more. The food was decent and of course it's a basic barbecue environment. The restaurant was clean and the noise level was to a minimum. They weren't very busy  and the best part of my dinner was a conversation with my family. I will return if I have to but it's definitely not my first choice.",

I love the chips that you munch on while waiting for your food, that's really worth that 1 star. Our server informed us of the change of ownership & how menu items/prices have changed. We gave it a closer look to notice and it did in fact change. They had Bar Rescue come in and revamp their drink menu which is cool. I just loved how convenient this spot was for some tasty BBQ. Now it tastes so bland, it's like too 'fast food' like for me. I wish this place stayed consistent through the change but it looks like I will venture back to Lucille's for some real good home style BBQ.",

You ever eat at a restaurant and order something that is so delicious that even though your stuffed you want one more bite to savor that taste? Well i surely didn't have that urge here, I didn't even ask for a box to take the leftovers home with me. The boneless chicken wings were chunks, wasn't sure I was eating chicken because it didn't taste like chicken. The buffalo sauce was not good ( little to no flavor ) I would of rather gotten it from a bottle of Ken's. If you want good BBQ you should go to Lucille's, you want good buffalo chick then hit up chicken shack. My co workers and I are always up and down blue diamond looking for places to eat lunch, I know what place I will not be recommending. Maybe I'll give Dave's another try in a year or later. I doubt it since there are so many other great places to eat. Hope this helps the next person from making a bad decision and being disappointed.",

It took us going to get a hostess to find our waitress (whom we had not seen since our order was placed). When who I am supposing was a covering waiter came by and asked what the problem was we told him we were still waiting on an entire meal and were almost done. Oddly enough he walks away and returns with it immediately so it was just sitting somewhere undelivered. He sent the manager Monica to our table who might as well not even come. Her troubleshooting entailed apologizing it happened then standing there awkwardly. We told her they also missed a side dish to which she looked confused and then retrieved the missing item. No compensation was offered at all for our inconvenience. No effort to make anything right. Not even an acknowledgement of their poor service. Don't waste your time.",

    "text": "This Famous Dave's was awful!  The only reason I didnt give it one star is because our waiter was so friendly. My husband complained that his Sprite tasted like dish water. I laughed him off thinking he was being particular. When he got his food he said his mashed potato tasted like medicine. So I decided to try it. Sure enough the mashed potatoes had a peculiar after taste and the Sprite did have taste like how dish water smells. My son said his burger was burnt. Took a look and the edges were burnt. Our food came out lukewarm. I get hotter food at my job's cafeteria. The corn was tasteless, like eating water. They need to change the distributor where the get corn from. Vons have great sweet corn on the cob, LOL!!! Im sick to my stomach to have spent the money I did on a HORRIBLE dinner for 4. I'll never, ever go back to this Famous Dave's and I'm on the verge of not going back to this chain all together. If you want good REAL BBQ stick to the mom and pops non chained non franchised places like TC Rib Crib, Big B's Texas BBQ etc. It seem like chain places dont put the effort or care into their food because they've made their millions and a name for themselves so why care.",

They have a good combo to choose from - a ribs + one meat + 2 sides for 15.99, or two meats + 2 sides for 14.99. I got the ribs combo and here's what I learned:  1) Mix the regular sauce (a bit sweet) with the Devil's spit sauce (a bit liquidy) to get the perfect bbq sauce 2) Get the beans. beans. beans 3) You might as well make your own mashed potatoes 4) Save some room for the delicious corn muffin  I'll probably still drive to Lucille's for BBQ (LOVE their sauces) unless I'm in the area again.",

    "text": "We have Famous Daves all over in SoCal and it has never appealed to me.  But then one day, my bro-in-law wanted something to eat and we made a quick pit stop to Famous Daves and ordered the burnt ends on a whim.  It was sooooo good.  I just love super charred, well-seasoned meat, and this just fits the bill.  I haven't tasted burnt ends in Kansas (since apparently, that's what they're know for).  However, I can say, that these are the best I have ever tasted.  I even tried burnt ends in the Famous Daves near where I live back home and it doesn't compare to the ones at this location.   I have since been back three different times to this place, and the burnt ends are just as good as when I first walked in the door.  I really can't comment on any other entree or meat since my preference have always been the burnt ends, so my review is not all that inclusive or conclusive.  I can say though that fries and chips are awesome, so I'm one happy camper when I'm here.",

When moving west from the southeast you yearn for that smell of BBQ. The service at this location was fantastic. I cannot say enough. I normally would praise the server by name, but I lost the receipt. I had the Georgia BBQ and it was pretty good. Don't get me wrong I have had better BBQ, but for west coast and a chain this was pretty good. I could not give it five stars because for a BBQ place I have had better. But it was good none the less. One big issue for me was that they put jalapenos in their mac and cheese. I am not sure where that comes from but it needs to stop. I grew up on good southern mac and cheese and never ever have they put jalapenos in it.",

    "text": "My first one star review and I stand by it.  Don't get me wrong i LOVE BBQ it probably one of my favorite foods but just not from Famous Daves.  This review actually covers the 2 regrettable times I came in.  I stopped by tocheck out FD with a couple of friends not too long ago. Walking in I thought the place looked horrendous, like a couple hill-billies had designed the place. But I know interior decor really is subjective so I don't really put too much thought on it but in my opinion this place is ugly.  We ordered what I thought would be safe bets, beef brisket, ribs, pulled pork. The usual fare at bbq restaurants. What we got when food arrived could be be described as an insult to the BBQ gods. The brisket was dry, almost complete devoid of flavor other than a smoky/charcoal taste to it. The ribs should have been fall of the bone tender but instead had to be ripped from the bone. the pulled pork was good once completely drenched in their BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce itself was another problem, I don't know what they use as their base (it doesn't taste like tomato) but its like water. I felt like I was squirting watered down store-brand BBQ sauce on my food. Not even the cornbread was good enough to garner another star here.  The service was completely lacking again. I hate having to waive down servers to get refills, condiments, or the check. They should be making routine stops to your table make sure everything is as it should be.  But I am not done yet...  I came in about 2 months later to pick up a large take out order from work. (thankfully i was not paying for it) The food order was ready when I got there and the server (or whatever you call the to-go order people) was nice enough to throw in some extra corn bread and condiments. I guess it was to make up for the disaster that I was soon to uncover.   I brought the food back to work, popped open the boxes and there was a collective \"WTF\" like response when everyone saw what was inside. The meat was burned. I am not saying over cooked, but i was burned. About 40% of each piece of meat was just pure tar and black ash. It couldn't even been eaten. I don't understand why a cook would do this! Its just plain mean! Our manager called FD back and totally bitched them out. I think she got her money back or a discount but seriously... I could probably get better BBQ at Albertsons. Def not coming back here.",

Menu - It can be difficult to figure out what you want, if you don't have a specific item that is your absolute must order. In this case, if you are with friends and family, order the All American Feast which is served on a garbage can lid.  Great selection.  2.  Garbage - Again, if you order the feast that comes on the garbage can lid, which I love as it is in the middle of the table and all share, they you can add on things like sausages and etc for a small fee.  IT is truly great stuff.   3.  Price - Reasonable.  4.  Kids - They will love it, why?  See point 5.  5.  Sauces - You can put your own sauce and they have plenty of choices on your table. Chances are your kids will not want a sauce as tangy and hot as you want, so this is a great choice for all.   6.  Large Groups - Great for this, but sometimes they can be a bit busy, so be careful and plan.   Overall, a nice place to enjoy and hang out.",

First in California, then the one near the Galleria mall, and then this one.   The first two were similar with atmosphere and nice dim lighting and delicious food   This one.... Boy... It was almost like a school cafeteria with no privacy, extremely bright lights, and weird layout. Not to mention the food tasted like it was heated up in a microwave and not the usual fresh tender amazing meat  I have not let this visit spoil my taste for Famous Dave's, however I will never return to this location",

I decided to go with the wings (1/2 off for HH), and onion strings. Both were excellent. Twentey-three ounces of beer (domestic) was about $2.99. Not too shabby if you ask me. I spent some time there and admired the decor, the people ordering trash lids of food and many other things.   Will I go back? Definitely. It's a no pressure sell if you ask me.",

He takes our drink orders and came back to take our main dish order.  We ordered Brisket, Mac n Cheese and burnt ends.  Everything was alright, but not memorable.    There are other BBQ places in the valley that are much better.  And, worth the drive... But, if you are in a hurry and for convenience, this place is alright.",

    "text": "Our last trip here was disappointing. Horrible customer service and bad food. For some reason or another the girlfriend wanted to stop here again tonight.  There was a lot of improvements the food was top notch but customer service was still lacking.  We were greeted and sat promptly but then it took the kid serving us almost 10mins to approach our table and take or drink orders. He must of had many tables as he disappeared for another 10 mins after delivering or drinks.   So we were there over 20mins without placing an order. Once the food was delivered (feast for two and catfish) a few of the butter containers had fallen into the beans and Cole slaw.   Not sure why we were presented our food in that fashion as we have no idea who/what last touched the butter containers before they ended up floating in our food. I guess its not that big of a deal since we would have touched them to open them up but it just wasn't the proper way to serve the food.  The girlfriend pointed this out and we received an apology and were asked if we wanted him to take it away and we declined. Like I said we would have touched them to open them so we kept our feast.  We asked for a to go box and containers for sides and the waiter was prompt in bringing them out but must have figured we were going to hand carry everything individually as no bag was brought to carry three items.  Since they did bring the Catfish Fingers back and I was told they will be there for a while (they ordered new menus) I will be back!",

While I will say the staff was attentive, though there weren't very many patrons at approximately 3 in the afternoon. But unfortunately it was the food that gives it only a three star. While I am a huge fan of BBQ everything I got was very dry and dry BBQ just doesn't go down well. The best part of my meal was definitely the cornbread though, the one redeeming factor lightly honey toasted and no bits of corn which I know some people love but I unfortunately do not.",

The brisket was very fatty so we sent it back. The next brisket that came out was dry and tough as if had been well over-cooked. The ribs were mostly bone and what little meat there was was dry and chewy. Did the manager on duty offer to comp any of us or make up for this poor experience in any way? No. I filled out a survey that reflected our dissatisfaction and a few days later I was contacted by a manager. He seemed concerned and said he would make it up to me by sending me a gift card. He never did. Very disappointing. I will never return to this location due to the poor food and lack of management concern and follow through. There are much better options.",

The BF loves loves loves the rib tips smoothered in the \"Devil's Spit\" barbecue sauce, barbecue beans,cole slaw and corn on the cobb. The fried onions is a greasy but yummy appetizer and you can't go wrong with sweet tea with lemon-refreshing!!!!

The hosts/ hostess are trained to seat everyone efficiently, and will always greet you with a smile. The servers are very enthusiastic, and helpful if you can't decide what you want to order.  They can recomand a handful of dishes! Last but the least,  the managers will step out to the dining room to speak to the guests to ensure everyone is having wonderful experiences.   My favourites:   Wings with Ranch- Their Ranch is creamy,  and taste very subtle. I love it.    Rib Tips- has a nice smokey flavor, and well seasoned.  Chilli- The best bowl of Chili I've ever had.  I usually add extra cheddar. Yum!  Conclusion: This place has always maintained their quality,  and excellence in customer service. It's a good restaurant with great employees!",

There were a few other tables full but I wouldn't say it was crowded.  We ordered the Feast for 2 and my son ordered the macaroni and cheese.   Macaroni and cheese was just blue box Kraft, which my son actually prefers over any fancier creamier version. Unfortunately there was a chunk of slightly burnt noodles obviously form the bottom of the pan, but the remainder was tasty and kept my kid happy. It came with fries which were nicely seasoned, a drink (good ol' white milk for us), and a two pack of Oreo cookies. Reasonable price for that amount of food.  Feast for 2:  1) half a slab of St.Louis style ribs - tasty, easy to bite off bone; would have preferred some more sauce. 2) 1/2 a country-roasted chicken - moist and flavorful, similar to rotisserie chicken; next time we would try the BBQ chicken in hopes of having the right sauce. Four different BBQ sauce choices but none were just right. We ended up mixing Sweet and Zesty and Rich and Sassy. 3) Georgia chopped pork - very tasty; would have loved more sauce. It would be really good as a sandwich which I believe they do have. 4) Coleslaw - not that \"creamy\" as they proclaim; a little on the bitter side; could have used a thicker and tangier sauce. 5) Wilbur Beans - interesting tangy and mildly zesty Beans. I actually enjoyed this as I had not tasted this combination of flavors before. 6) Corn on the cob - four half cobs; a little over cooked having that saturated soggy water taste. I will probably cut it off the cob and mix it in with something else. 7) Fries - steak fry wedges delightfully crispy and crunchy; tasted good with a mixture of the BBQ sauces  8) Corn bread muffins (2) - honestly the best cornbread muffin or cake I have ever had at a BBQ place; just the right amount of corn flavor but moist enough you're not choking on crumbs like I have in the past.  Overall it was a satisfying meal. We ended up taking a lot of it home as it was obviously a lot of food. I gave it three stars for a good meal; nothing mind blowing but nothing strongly disappointing enough to ruin my meal.",

We order the nachos without jalapeno because not everyone in the house can handle spicy foods.  Last restaurant visit they completely ignored the request and didn't really offer to make a new one.  I had to request it.  This time I ordered online takeout and checked NO JALAPENO.  When they showed me at the counter there were none visible; however, the cooks decided to hide the at the bottom of the nachos and we didn't see until the dish was half eaten.  The spice from the juice made my wife have some digestive issues.  Not a cool move to hide a mistake like that when people have sensitive stomachs.  Also, it seems like the food is getting spicier, which distracts from the taste.  The rib rub was spicier than usual.  The baked beans were also kicked up more than in the past.  The chicken and pork were fine and had no issues.  There's definitely been a change at this location, and I don't think my family will be ordering from here again.",

I was put on hold twice , Then Famous Gabby talked over me through the entire order rushing me through as quickly as possible ! Maybe they are busy ....   To my wife's surprise not busy at all !! She showed up 20 minutes after the order was placed and Famous Gabby did not even put the order in yet . My wife was furious having to wait 30 minutes for our order. During that time the manager had passed by three times not even willing to offer any assistance and an employee that was not so famous because he was clocked out was leaning over the counter talking to Gabby ! My wife then asked if she could get Texas Pit BBQ sauce and Gabby said sorry we don't have it Available in packets . She then said I will just give you a bottle .   Wife returns home and the sauce is Rich and Sassy !! Not a fan .... the ribs were nearly cold and very dry ! The fries soggy and the potatoes were also cold . Not a great experience this time around . My wife decided to call and share her experience with a manager just so they would be aware of the lack of customer service and training. The manager proceeded to make excuses and blame it on a new system that was installed!   Truly Disappointed ....",

    "text": "This really disappoints me to write this. I've been going to Famous Dave's for years. I'd go back & forth between this location & the Henderson location by the Galleria Mall. It was always consistent with great quality weather it was dining in or takeout. I hadn't eaten there in awhile, and decided to get a takeout order from this location last night. I ordered the build your own burger for myself, the Chicken strips platter for my GF & two kids chicken strips for my children. When i picked them up, the very friendly young lady at the take out counter, went over my order & opened each box. I noticed the food, the chicken strips especially, looked really dried out & not fresh. Also, the food is much smaller as well as the portions. My kids ended up not even eating theirs, but my GF did, and she ended up sick all night. I just chalked it up as a bad meal. Then, today, my Mom revealed me she ordered from the Henderson location last night & today she's been vomiting all day. Also, i've read some of these other reviews on here & it seems a lot of people had the same experience's. What gives Famous Dave's? Is this how you're going to operate now? You're getting people sick by reheating food that's been probably sitting out all day. Not cool at all. I'm sorry to say, but you have lost a pretty loyal customer. If you keep this practice up, i won't be the only one.",

Their food and sauces were really really good! I, personally, do not usually like bbq sauce because I always like dry rub on my ribs but their sauce was really good. 4 of us split the feast thing for 2-3 people which was PLENTY there was 4 of us and we were all full at the end of the night. so It's like perfect for 4 people. if two people ordered it, they would def have left over for the next day, WHICH I do not recommend. I love left over food, for some reason they taste really good to me. My sister had left over and she didn't eat it the next day so I did lol and it honestly was not good. At all. So if you're going to order something, just eat it there and don't bother taking it home, it just didn't taste right for me.  My nephew had a kids meal, pull pork sandwich. He got food poisoning from it that night. and threw up like 7 times till the following day....so..maybe it something he ate earlier or it was just that day but I would stir clear...just incase.  I wish I remember the girl that waited us because she was really nice.  I hope this help. Other than my nephew getting sick, it went pretty well. Devil's Spit mix with the mustard one is REALLY good.",

Best time to go is during their lunch specials. most things are discounted down a couple bucks. i went for dinner a couple months ago and had the burnt ends, OMG!! so BOMB. they also had some chip they bring out with dinner. they are really good with the hot bbq sauce. they sauces is something i really like, they fit well with different things are should all be tried at least once.   only reason they aren't getting a 5 star rate is their servers. when i can a couple months ago the gentleman that served us was very nice but not very knowledgeable about the product, he may have been new so he gets a pass. :P the lady that served us last week was nice enough to check on us but didn't really offer anything, no advice or extras.",

Being a \"newbie\" to this franchise, we choose a platter combination. Well, we can truthfully say we were impressed with the \"2 Person Sampler Platter\"! OMG it feed our party of 3 adults completely and we still had left overs. A great BBQ variety (pork, beef, chicken), corn-on-the-cob, fluffy corn bread, crispy/ hot French fries and their wide variety of sweet, hot and tangy BBQ sauces that were to everyone's liking. Service was on par and our waiter was always on top of everything.  Wish we had one in South Florida (Broward County) were we long for a new BBQ establishment (sigh) for it is a distance (+2000 miles) to indulge our monthly foodie carvings. Cheers!",

We at one time enjoyed this BBQ joint but their standards of service and quality of food have sunken to new depths that we won't be returning to famous daves! Only thing they're serving up is a HOT MESS. Despite all of this the manager was aware of this and didn't even visit the table",

The sauce at Famous Daves is a bit much and really kills the great seasoning and taste of the ribs.  Try them once like this and you will never have sauce on them again.    The side orders, none of them seem great so I suggest you ask for the corn bread instead.  Service is great and I love the to go option.",

The kid says, \"mom would like apple/cranberry\" She says, \"a what?\" \"Half apple, half cranberry.\"  She says, \"I am only helping out because it is busy, I have to ask your server.\" REALLY, how are you helping if you can't mix 2 juices?        8 minutes later, the waitress comes to get our drink order. Apple/Cran/ no Ice, lemonade/no ice/ Sprite/ Long Island IT/ no Lemon. 10 minutes go by. The manager, or another server comes to ask for our food order, which wife says, \"the other one already took our drink order, we're still waiting.\" Instead of taking our order, she says she'll go find out what is going on...5 more minutes. Our drinks come, and the Sprite is perfect as lemons (I'm allergic) and ice abound.      2 minutes later we can order. Q for 2, Rib tips dinner, Brisket dinner. I had the Rib Tips and  potato with a salad. the dinner came and the tips were dry and chewy. The potato was ok, and since I was hungry, the only thing eaten. Everyone else was ok, although we all left with boxes (6 in all).      The service was terrible, the food was mediocre. Try changing to, \"Dave Makes Some Food.\" I dunno how he got famous.",

Upon entering we were greeted and taken to a booth. Look liked It was happy hour for drinks and beers.  I was lost on what I wanted because it was my first time. But I found the lunch menu page with great prices. Our server was mike and he was very friendly and patient.   I ended up getting the 3 meat combo with brisket short ribs and roasted chicken, and a broccoli side. My boyfriend ordered the 3 meat combo as well. $12 is a deal. He got the corn side.  We love sauces and the devils spit fire sauce in the table was our favorite. If you ask the server they can get you a hotter bbq sauce that tastes like habanero.  As for the food. The food was filling but I'm pretty sure they roast in large portions and reheat as you order. The brisket was kind of dry and ribs were soft but wasn't that fresh soft. It is all really good. I asked my boyfriend which he liked and he said they all pretty much taste the same.  I enjoyed the corn bread!  Our waters were always refilled and we were checked on.  All that matter is that my cravings were filled.   I would be back.  Definitely didn't have room for dessert darn lol.",

UPDATE: I ordered delivery and our ribs had sit for a while and was stale and cold and not fit to eat. What little was ate made my wife sick all night. Even the dessert serving was minimum and mostly whipped cream. I tried calling to speak to management but was told it was very busy and I would get a call back but that did not happen, I then emailed the restaurant thinking a manager would call but got nothing.  I order from this location often and have never got a bad meal until now.  I will never return or order from Famous Dave' Sorry for the rant but I would expect better quality.   I received a call from \"DJ\" and called right back and was told that DJ wasn't there by Thomas and explained what happened, he said that he would talk to DJ and I would get a return call and of course that didn't happen. (Explains the bad food due to lack of management)  So I filed a complaint to get a refund and will never do business again with Famous Dave's.  UPDATE: I never received ANY return calls or issued a refund. (As stated) Such bad management!",

We made reservations for a table of 9 at 6:45 p.m we arrived and the hostess said that they didn't have our table ready and that it would be 20 mins. I looked in the restaurant and they had several empty tables, wasn't busy at all.   When we got sat, the server came over and took our drink order, she did say that food was taking a little longer than usual to come out. She did bring out 2 complimentary house salads and some cornbread and we had been waiting for our appetizers to come out. We had ordered some burnt ends and some cheese curds ( which we never got) and it took about 45 min to get the burnt ends to the table.   We waited an hour and 15 min for our food, that alone is ridiculous and even then, not everyone in our party got their food, they ended up waiting a little longer.   No complaints on our server, you can tell she was feeling bad and was embarrassed on how long everything was taking.   We aren't coming back, save your self the hassle, just drive up the street to the Silverton Casino, you have 2 better options there, Crakerbarrel or the restaurant inside Bass Pro Shop",

Even with the Friday night busy crowd she was able to take care of us.  Our food and drinks were all prompt and perfect.",

The food is almost always perfect, and adequately sized portions for the price.  This particular visit, however, the service was extremely disappointing.  Our server was doing her best, but had way too many tables. To make it worse, food was very slowly coming out of the kitchen. Even though we saw a few tables get their food before us, that sat after us.  I'm not sure what was going on, but she seemed to have too much on her hands, and our food seemed to take forever. For a group of three, we were there for over two hours.  The server gave us some free chips and free soups for the wait, so I appreciate the fact that she tried rectifying the poor situation.  Therefore, since this was the only bad experience I've have, I'll still give 4 stars as I normally don't get an experience such as that.",

But this location has the worst food and the worst service.   Brisket and Cedar Plank Salmon were dry and cold. Brisket had no flavor and tasted old. Seems like we got the left overs from the day before. Sad to say I will not be back at this place.  The server Brittney, horrible, with lots of attitude. She is just really bad at her job. No personality whatsoever. She is slow and was just a total bitch. At the end she was nowhere to be found. We've been waiting to just pay the bill and get the heck out but she's too busy chit chatting with the cooks and other servers, and after about 15 minutes she finally showed up, she had the nerve to say \"sorry, i was on break\". Said it in a rude way too, like we were interrupting her break!    The  \"manager\" Debra is in the wrong field, she is nasty and should not be in the position.",

My order got messed up could've had something to do with the loudness of the restaurant or our sever not really paying attention who knows. Not a big deal I let it go but my girlfriend brought it up and she apologized and offered to get it fixed I didn't want to wait so I just ate what I got. The bbq chicken was good, juicy and tender. Not a big fan of the Mac and cheese that has corn in it and what seems like queso cheese sauce.  Server took awhile to come back towards the end of our meal with our check and we ended up just waiting with everyone finished for maybe about 6-7 minutes.  All in all Id give the food a 5 star but I wouldn't call that \"Mac and cheese\". Service left a bit to be desired as far as being present and cutting above mediocre, so three stars on the service.",

They were lean, tasty, and typically never served in plentiful enough quantities.  I visited my brother and mother in Nevada over this past Thanksgiving. Typically when I see my brother, it gives us an opportunity to eat meals we don't normally eat.  This time he said \"I've gotta take you to Famous Daves!\"  Usually my brother's judgement is questionable, but not on this day.  He was 100% right, and for the rest of the night, I was thinking about how delicious those ribs were.  I will be back.  I may even go to the nearest one to me, which is nearly 45+ minutes away.  These ribs were incredibly lean, moist and flavorful.  The finest ribs I have ever eaten.  Seriously.",

Just to my surprise everything tasted like it had been made hours before & not even attempted to be heated up to at least act like it was fresh . Nothing was hot & just all tasted old . Honestly could of just went to a fast food joint then spend extra money on cold old food .",

First we walk in & wait in the front for a good 15 mins before a host comes to greets us & seats us , then our server was HORRIBLE & I think she was probably high , I asked her THREE times for water with lemon , she brings the water & forgets the lemon TWICE! Then we order raspberry lemonade & strawberry lemonade & she mixes them up ... Then we have to literally wave her down for refills ! Her name is REDD. I'm 200% sure she is high as can be. Our food came out in 10 mins , & it tastes reheated. REDD offered us sauces but failed to bring them so we had to ask someone else to grab them for us. She grabs my plate not even asking me if I want a to go box ...so here goes another 30 mins before we get our check to go. Still no lemons for my water either .... Now on to talk about the food ....  The brisket was just full of fat , so it was GROSS. I had 2 pieces & left it alone.  The mashed potatoes were OKAY , I've had better.  The mac & cheese was disgusting !!!!! It didn't stand a chance.   The corn bread was GREAT & so were the beans.   The raspberry lemonade was also good.   I'll never come back here & this was my first time & last for sure. I'll stick with lucielles",

Its okay I gave another BBQ place my business and will rate them 5 stars for their great customer service. Famous Daves should be called Failed Dave's. I will make sure my company never tries to Order from them again.",

We got the feast for two in order to sample as many of the meats/sides as we could for a small party.   St. Louis Style Spareribs: Disappointing. Very tough and difficult to bite off the bone. The only thing saving them was the nice glaze of viscous basted sauce on them.  Beef Brisket: Average. I've had worse (i.e. tough) and I've had better (tender and juicy). These were tender, just kind of bland. I slathered them in the Texas Pit sauce (their medium sauce with peppercorns) to get more of the smoke flavor that should already be inherent in the brisket itself, and was able to down them.  Chopped Pork: Best of the three meats we tried. Tender and pulled apart easily. Tried it w/ the Georgia mustard sauce. A little bit too much vinegar for my taste, but nice runny consistency.   Sides: Recommend the cornbread and the corn on the cob. Potato salad was a bit hard (wished they had boiled the potatoes for more than two minutes), and fries just your average steak fries.",

    "text": "10.13.11 Our party of 4 was passing through the Vegas area & thought bbq was in order.  Of course, we Yelp'd the closest place in the area we were in and 4-star Famous Dave's popped up. It was last Thursday night about 8 p.m. The joint wasn't busy & we showed ourselves to the bar area. Our server was our bartender & she was quite perky with a smile & very attentive. My Fat Tire was cold & refreshing especially after a long drive with 3 buddies. My 1/3 slab of ribs arrived at the table steaming hot. Accompanying my ribs were my side choices of the slaw & wedge cut fries. The menu boasted a 4-bone hand rubbed spiced ribs, but there on my plate, I spied a 5th rib! SCORE! Either I was REALLY hungry or the ribs were actually quite tasty...so tasty, as I was taking my last bite off the last available rib on my plate, I had wished I'd ordered a 1/2 slab. As a member of a competition barbeque team, I can honestly say these ribs are better than most teams we've gone up against.  I can't speak for the restaurant side, but the bar is large with a small selection of draught on tap. Several flat screens hang from the ceilings & viewable from anywhere you sit. I also can't speak for my compadres' dinner selections, but judging from their empty plates, they also were either very hungry or this place really IS quite tasty. However, I drew the short straw in sharing a room with the buddy who ordered the side of beans. Good stuff Famous Dave's. I shall visit another one of these soon, provided I'm in the vicinity of one & have a hankerin' for bbq on the fly. Cold beers & above par bbq. Better than warm beers & bland meat. \"...because, without BEER & BBQ, things do not seem to go as well...\" Rounding up from 3.75 stars.  Eat well & drink responsibly...this has been another deez review because you need it & want it. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Excellent BBQ! We've gone here twice and both times we ordered the Que for Two, $19.99- which is a special (great deal), but you must ask for it, since it isn't on the menu. We got the following (several choices): brisket (my favorite- but ask for it \"lean\"), ribs (my husband's favorite), chicken, two corn muffins, steak fries, coleslaw, and a slice of toast. The service was not only great, but quite speedy- we actually got our food in five minutes! The meat is so tender- falls off the bone tender, the (yummy) corn muffins , and the fries were very good as well (don't usually like steak fries so I was pleasantly surprised). On your table sits a paper towel dispenser and wet naps tucked in the sugar dish- which you will need to use because as you know, your hands will get very dirty. Also, there are five signature sauces, like Devil's Spit (hot! unless you like the heat) and Sweet N Sassy. The server can explain what each sauce contains or you can be adventurous and try them all. We had the bread pudding for dessert, which is more like a flan (love flan), served with a scoop of vanilla and whipped cream with a gooey caramel nut sauce- delicious, but we were so full at that point that we didn't finish it. (And we did some shopping/walking afterwards- one of the best strip malls in the city, BTW.)  There are other feasts on the menu for groups of four- which are great deals and served on trash can lids. Sign up on their e-mail list for coupons. The mascot is a smiling pig(why do they always have to be so cute?); kitsch barbeque decor and, the staff wears logo t-shirts with funny barbeque-isms. The hostess opens the door for you and greets you with a smile. Way better than Memphis BBQ. Will definitely come back here.",

The bar was totally empty when our party of 4 sat down and Matt, the bartender took his sweet time getting our initial drink order. Food arrived and was tasty as usual, but even if something had been wrong, Matt never even really checked back to see how things were. We had a bday coupon that was visible on the table and he ran hubby's credit card without even acknowledging the coupon. When confronted he had a crappy attitude about it saying \"well, I can fix it but it'll take like two days for it to be credited back, yadda yadda yadda.\" Okay, so fix it. That's 16 bucks off of our $85 tab, buddy. And guess what? It ain't going towards your tip. Had to go chase down a manager to take care of it, which took him all of 4 minutes. Being a server myself, I know how easy it is to reverse a transaction... and I also know how to leave the shitty attitude at the door when I show up for work.  This won't stop us from going back to this location but if Matt's tending bar we're sitting in the dining room from now on.",

The \"dragon's spit\" was not as spicy as I would have expected, but tasty none the less.   I washed it all down with a root beer float which was HUGE!!!! My order was placed to go.

Cedar plank salmon was so good the plate was licked clean. Side salad is delicious with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Fries are ok but the steamed broccoli is done to perfection. A great option in an area generally starved of anything other than fast food.",

So the next day I headed right over to Famous Dave's to make sure I wasn't trippin on how food should taste like.  I ordered a DOZEN CORN MUFFINS - no need any sauce on it but some butter always makes any bread taste even better than it does.  APPETIZER BURNT ENDS - little chopped pieces smothered in bbq sauce and it comes with some fried onions and some spiced pickles which are AWSOME!   I would have to say I was not tripping about the other place because the burnt ends here were much more edible than the other place. Although it was a little more on the dry side this time but not to the point of jerky - Ness. The cashier that took my order was quick and prompt and went over what was in each box for me. Food was ready and togo within 10 min!",

The decor is of an outdoor country picnic with string lights on the ceilings and red and white checkered tablecloths. The ribs well excellent! The sauce is so good and the full slab was enough to feed 4. As for the sides, a little underwhelming. I was disappointed in how soupy the mac and cheese was and it lacked flavor as well like it had been watered down. The catfish I had as an appetizer though was so good! Spicy but not too much heat and the seasoning tasted Cajun and really makes you feel like you are somewhere in the south.",

I thought the food was great, obviously. My hubby found a chicken bone in his pulled chicken sandwich and they took it off the bill without us even asking, which was very nice. All the food was prepared well, came out hot and quickly. Our server, Lacey, was wonderful and right on top of things. Price was great for everything we got (even before the sandwich came off the bill). The only gripe I have, is that there were jalapenos in the cheese sauce over the baked potato and it didn't say that on the menu. It wasn't a deal breaker though. The restaurant was clean, bathrooms were clean and we will most definitely go back.   Update: Rib tips were amazing, bbq chicken totally rocked, broccoli and mashed potatoes were awesome, but the pickled onions topped everything off PERFECTLY! Why have I never seen these here before? They made everything I paired them with, divine. Bathrooms were super clean (again), tables were clean, server was great. My one gripe this time, the beef was DRY. I'm talking beef jerky. Still five stars because all the awesome overshadowed the jerky, but I hope they fix this before we go back. And we will go back. My daughter and I eat mostly vegetarian. This is our cheat day place. :)",

Who ever prepped the dehydrated mash potatoes forgot to add the package of seasoning. So I just ended up sticky dehydrated potatoes.

It was brought out to use promptly. Then we placed our order. We all order the 2 choice meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread muffin. The manager at one point stepped in to help her in the bar area. The manager brought all of us more water to drink. And asked if we needed anything else.  BOTTOM LINE: Great Service,Great Food,Great  ambience. Hands down to the bar tender. She was great!!",

Might as well go to Burger King order a whopper and add some of there Devils spit BBQ sauce to it (you can buy it at any grocery store).  Skip the burger.

There were only 5 people at the bar, yet it was hit and miss for him to notice an obvious need such as an almost empty drink. At one point I got his attention for a drink, but after 5 minutes after not getting one, I had to get his attention again to finally get a drink. No apology that he had forgotten. To his slight defense he was also servicing the waitresses, but there wasn't hardly any orders coming through there. I used to manage a bar, and know that a good bartender should constantly be looking for obvious signs of customers in need of more service.",

This place is located on Blue Diamond Road not too far from highway 15 so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself is somewhat large, and doesn't get too busy so no problem to get a table.  We decided to take the ultimate burger and the pulled chicken burger along with a cup of chili, fries and rice, and a brownie. The ultimate burger was very good, while the pulled chicken burger was a little less so. Service was pretty fast and we ended up paying $23 for all this food. Definitely give it a try if you like BBQ!  In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

    "text": "It's never good when you feel like you have to start a review with \"where to begin.\"  So...where to begin?  Let's start with the service. If you haven't noticed, service is a big deal to me. I work in a service industry, I appreciate customer service, and I know what it takes to provide good service (most of the time it's just being nice - ya, that's pretty much it). The service at this establishment was very hit and miss. Our waitress, Stacie had moments where she was very attentive and nice and moments where she was quite possibly the most overbearing and annoying server I've ever had. Let's start with the bad. I understand that every server has a unique style that works for them. However, Stacie felt that it was necessary to call my wife and I \"Young man\" and \"Young lady\" every time she stopped at our table. She literally (no exaggeration here) said those phrases at least 25 times while we were eating there. I'm not sure how old she is, but certainly wasn't old enough to use this term. It just came across as obnoxious. I'm not 5, I'm not in trouble, and your not in a senior citizens home, so don't call me young man. Do you need a refill young man? Can I take your order young man? And you young lady? Anything else young man? STOP IT!!!! Stacie then asked us if \"our food was delicious.\" Unfortunately it wasn't, and this bothered her. She managed that situation very well and it's obvious that she cares about the product coming out of the kitchen. For that I praise her, I just don't care for an overbearing, loud, obnoxious personality when I'm dining (unless I'm at Dick's Last Resort).   Now to the food. We tossed around the idea of trying a few different restaurants. I'm sad we didn't pick the others. This was our second experience with Famous Dave's and it was equally, if not more disappointing than the first. I just don't see what others get out of this place. Their bbq sauces at the table might be some of the worst tasting sauces in the history of bbq. I ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich with a side of jalapeno mac-n-cheese. My sandwich was okay, the chicken was very dry though. The mac-n-cheese was awful. It tasted like they cooked the mac-n-cheese then just dumped the jalapenos in after everything was cooked. Not good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. All I could smell was burned chicken. It came with nothing on it, the meat wasn't seasoned at all, and it was very overcooked. She ordered the slaw with it which she said was very good. The sandwich was boring, overcooked, and the presentation was very undesirable.   Upon telling the server that the food wasn't \"delicious.\" She sent over a manager. We appreciated him stopping by, and we were very honest with him. He did everything right and offered to replace my wifes sandwich. We declined and told him that this was our second experience here and we just weren't satisfied. He gave us various options but we decided to just stick with what we had and agreed that this would be our last experience at Dave's.   Lucille's at the District is a much better BBQ option that Famous Daves. I'd rather just not eat than have to eat here again.  Famous Daves...you are the weakest link...goodbye.",

Crispy texture on cue. Ribs were not as juicy as I was expecting. And tri-tip tasty but a little dry that I needed to drench in devil's spit sauce.

I sat next to a family where the father kept saying, \" wow, I am a Barbecue snob and I think this barbecue is amazing!\" So of course I looked over to see what this Que king was eating and he had the ribs and the brisket... I Could not let this self proclaimed BBQ snob enjoy all the saucy goodness all alone so I ordered the Ribs and Brisket combo with the mac and cheese and potatoes...   The waiter brought out the plate and to the eye I was impressed, it looked juicy, tasty and everything a BBQ snob hopeful could ask for. I pulled a rib off the half rack and raised it to my mouth......... Now that you are waiting for some crazy descriptive to tell you how delicious it was take a moment to enter your own word here............... Okay that's enough of that, its my turn, It was Crap, somehow the rib pulled off the half rack but maybe in the 2 foot travel to my mouth it got jet lag or something because it was dull, dry and unexciting. I was in no way impressed and was doubting the BBQ snobs credentials.   I then figured, \" well I need to be fair, and try the brisket,\" It had that nice brisket look with the pink rim and cooked center so i grabbed my fork and went at it. Hoping to reignite my passion to be on the BBQ snob wagon I tore into it and low and behold I had the same crappy experience, it was dry and had a rather odd taste for brisket. If I could have made a BBQ Snobs citizens arrest or revoked his snob certificate I would have.   The server was great, he kept my drink full and checked in on us just enough to be very attentive and not a creeper. So if you really take a look at what I am saying, I would go back for a drink, some mac and cheese and to socialize with a waiter... Is this reason enough to go back... .Ehhh, Not this time.... Sorry Dave!",

It was 'date night' recently and the lady and I finally decided to go visit Famous Dave's since we've always talked about it but never quite made the committment to try it.  So I gassed up the ride, put on some Mr. Bean in the DVD player, microwaved some popcorn, put out a couple Klondike Bars (hmmm...what wouldn't I do for a Klondike Bar?), and said \"Later, kids!\"  And we were off!  Although, thinking back I think I forgot to leave another phone number in case of emergencies.  Luckily, everything was fine when we got back home.  Except the funny English accent my little one gave me upon our arrival (thanks Mr. Bean).  Famous Dave's interior is really...decorated.  This place is like the Disneyland of BBQ!  There's stuff everywhere, I guess this is what it's like to come to a corporate BBQ!  Nothing like those down home places where all you smell is smoke, the walls are dingy, and the chairs are rickety.  Looks like Dave's been making a healthy buck on his 'que.  But the place was inviting nonetheless.    Famous Dave's has a good menu that includes lots of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, and BBQ combos.  But we were there for one thing only, the infamous 'Que for Two' for $19.99!  Sorry, payday wasn't until the next week and it was all we could afford.  Hard times I tell ya!  Upon ordering this from our server with some cold drinks, he was on his way.  20 minutes later our BBQ bliss had arrived.  I heard from co-workers that the Que for Two wasn't enough for two people and that I would be hungry afterwards.  Me being a 'husky' sized Asian boy was a little let down upon hearing this.  But when our platter arrived, I sure wasn't disappointed!  There was more than enough food for two!  We had four of Dave's 'Famous' ribs, 1/2 a BBQ chicken, 1/2 a serving of chopped pork+1/2 a serving of beef brisket (I couldn't decide on which one so I asked for both..ha ha), Famous Fries, two cornbread muffins, and a side of garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  I gotta tell ya'...it was all pretty good!  The ribs were moist, flavored well, and cooked just right with a tiny bit of bite in em'.  The chopped pork and the brisket were very good too, and tender.  But the biggest surprise for me was the chicken.  Often times chicken can get dry in a BBQ pit but this one was super succulent and moist, and the rub was great.  This was my fav of the night.  And it was all so good with their sauces!  I liked all six of them but my favs were their original Rich & Sassy, Sweet & Zesty, and the Devil's Spit (sucker is spicy hot!).  Service was good, our server kept up with us and kept us stocked with wet naps and our drinks full.    Next time, I'm taking the kids with us and we're so gonna have the All-American BBQ Feast...old school and served on a trash can lid!  The lid is lined with paper...of course.  I saw it that night on a table...and the sucker is HUGE!  It can easily feed four people...unless you're a mighty Samoan...then this would be considered your 'Que for Two'.    We had enough food leftover to take a doggie bag home for the kids.  Admittedly, I finished the last rib that night as a midnight snack.  But I did leave the fries for them!  But I did also manage to finish the little one's Klondike Bar.  Boy, am I a big lil' piggy.",

    "text": "1 star = for the corn..tasty!  Buttery! and for the super delicious beans.  Best beans I've ever tasted!  Has a kind of spice to it. 2 stars = for the mac and cheese...cheesy and yummy...there is even an option to have jalapeno flavor! 3 stars = for the pulled pork because it was the only meat with any real flavor  I would have given a 4th star for the catfish because it tasted good, but the serving was so small!  We also ordered the rib tips which tasted okay, and the brisket which was okay too, only if drenched in BBQ sauce because it was kinda dry.    Overall, the experience was just alright.  I was not too impressed, but might come back for a second try if I need a BBQ fix as it is close to my pad.  Plus the sides here are really good, you know..be SIDES the meat!",

Dig into the traditional wings with the pineapple habenero and then add the Ultimate BBQ Burger with jalepeno bacon,cheese,bbq pork and you have a deadly combination. Sides like Wilbur Beans and Mac and Cheese are very memorable too.",

I usually ask for a side order of pulled chicken which is nice and tender.  I want to try the ribs, but haven't yet.    The service has always been really good here, very down to earth servers which can be hard to find in Vegas!",

    "text": "Dave's is what would happen if you were to take a rustic rib shack from the dirty dirty, run it through a Corporate even somewhat Disney like scrub and move it to a blistering desert.  In another words, if you want an authentic, rustic rib shack and you hate the idea of a chain like place, this is not your place.  Fortunately for me, I don't mind the garish touristy-ness of the place.  I just want reasonably priced food and if I'm lucky, beer.  Although their happy hour is advertised as 2-6p, I noted that our 11:30am lunch on a Saturday also qualified.  So if you are hell bent on happy hour, which for $2.99 23 oz beers, that's pretty good, then check ahead.  As noted, by other reviewers, $8.99 two item combos with corn muffin and one side for lunch is a fantastic deal.  However, the overall food is quite average.  Not a bad thing or anything.  I was happy with it, but it wasn't as good as Baby Blue in LA.  The \"Devil's Spit\" sauce was pretty good, but it was not spicy at all.  I couldn't tell the sweet BBQ sauce wings from the spicy.  And seriously, not even cholulu spicy, let alone tapatio.  The sweet sauce was not so good.  I think you can just skip the wings.  The Devil's spit is okay from the bottle for your other meats aside from the lack of spiciness.   This place is clean.  You could eat off the floor.  Good job.  The air conditioning is blasting, so you may get a bit cold if you are chugging cold beers and are sensitive to cold.  Service is standard, though a bit spotty when it gets busy.  Instead of having three hostesses, Dave's should add one or two servers during lunch rush.  Overall, 3 platters, 12 wings, 5 beers, 1 side salad plus tax and tip for $62?  Not bad, not bad.  Mind blowing authentic BBQ joint... not so much.  But as long as you aren't a BBQ snob, you'll be fine.  Enjoy.",
