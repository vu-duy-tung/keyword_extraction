    "text": "Delicious food. My wife had the bacon cheeseburger. And I had the pastrami burger. We also shared chilly cheese fries and a very good chocolate custard shake. You will wait a while for the food because there was only one person who takes your order and makes the food. Or there was only one person when we went. The wait is with it though. Kind of on the expensive side. We spent $32.00 for what we ordered. Its just a few minutes away from the strip, so it might be a good place to stop by if you want something to eat while you wait to check in your hotel.",

    "text": "I have never heard of this place prior to browsing the pages of Vegas restaurants on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> website.  I read the reviews here- and figured that we had to try it.  First I want to say that this location is not in a sketchy part of town as someone else mentioned.  I grew up in Vegas, and this is just an older part of town.  Parking is okay.  It's actually kind of hard to figure out where you are supposed  to park, but we were informed that next time we can park at the old Al Phillips cause that place in un-occupied.  So lets get to to food.  It is so hard to decide what to get.  We don't like pastrami, but the menu is full of things that aren't pastrami.  So we ended up with burgers.  My husband had the Big Ass Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was good- and huge.  It has a ton of cheese- really, it's a lot.  Almost too much.  The fries were decent, but they are like shoestring fries and we aren't really a fan of those- a friend of ours says they have fatter fries, we'll have to check next time.  The strawberry lemonade was AWESOME.  The hamburger meat seems a little bland though- maybe add some season salt?  Luckily the burgers are piled with a bunch of other stuff that's got some flavor so it's still good.  The building is kinda like a little shack.  The indoor dining area has 5 tables I believe and each table seats 4.  There is also outdoor seating.  I don't know if they have highchairs- I didn't see any(they do have a kids menu though).  I don't know about a customer bathroom either?  The guy who rings you up is the owner I believe.  He kinda talks A LOT- well not kinda, he talked about random things to all the customers eating almost the entire time we were there(he also liked to brag about all the food and how good it was).  Don't get me wrong- the food is good, but I think some of it is a bit overdone and impossible to eat and it's not like I was in food heaven while eating it.  So if you want a quiet lunch- eat outside.  This place is good and the prices are good.  We will return.",

At the drive up speaker there is a sign \"please ask for a menu when you pull up to the window\". This translates into a very long wait time as each meal of their very large menu is prepared after you order. So the drive though is worthless. Also inside is very stuffy and hot. Like I said the food was great and the cook friendly. To management I say think about getting the poor guy some help at least on the weekends when business picks up. The two stars are for management and not the cook or the food.",

    "text": "After seeing this place on the Travel Channel and finding out it was right here in Las Vegas I thought I'd give it a try. This would turn out to be a horrible decision.   I went to the location on Tropicana (as this review is for) and went through the drive through. I should have turned around after seeing how low budget their signs and graphics were (this would turn out to be a reflection of their over all attitude). I then drove up to the window and waited for around 4-6 minutes. I thought they were closed (even though it was 6pm on a weekday) because no one came to the window. I did see other cars and saw some customers walking in the front. Finally a guys comes to the window. He doesn't speak much English. I explained a few times we were ordering 2 reubens one with corn beef and one with pastrami (you have the choice here which is nice). We ordered the fries and onion rings and some drinks too. He just closed the window when I said the drinks. I wasn't sure if he was coming back or got my order or even understood it. He never even told us our total or how long it would take.   At least 13 minutes passed by while we sat in at the drive up window. I did try yelling a couple times but no one came back to the window. Lucky we were the only car there. After 20 minutes I got out of the car and went in the front door.  There were about 10 people all standing around impatiently and I saw this dirty disgusting kitchen with one guy (fresh over the boarder) working by himself. One couple canceled their order and walked out. He didn't seem to even care. I don't blame this guy since he was working his butt off and was really sweaty (which was dripping all over) and he didn't have any help. Needless to say after I went back in the car and got the food over 1/2 hour had passed probably close to 40 minutes. I asked the worker if he was the only the one and he said in broken English that the owner wouldn't get him any help and told him he can work by himself.   When we got home both the reubens were very fatty. It was like a dead flesh flavored chewing gum. The lemonade was awesome (the only good part of the meal), the fries were just fried frozen potato sticks, the onion rings were nothing special and everything was way too greasy. They also didn't have any ranch available. The one employee said he had been too busy to make the ranch.   The owner of the restaurant  should be hung, drawn, and quartered. How dare you leave this poor immigrant by himself in there to fend for himself. This place screams health hazard and disaster all over it.   This just goes to show you. What you see on TV can be a totally different experience. I do hope the owner(s)/manager(s) get their acts together and makes this place better for the real customer experience.",

Sammy's is pretty pricy, but worth it, most of the time. This last time I ordered two of there standard small pastrami sandwiches and a large drink. After the guy at the counter finally got around to taking my order and giving me attitude because I was looking at other menu items, it took him another five minutes to give me my drink. This may not seem like a long time except that there were no other customers, inside or in the drive thru. I asked for easy ice and he filled it to the top with ice. When my sandwiches arrived, they were a bit small. I get more meat at Subway. At $24 for two sandwiches and a drink, I expect more. Other customers came in and got the same attitude, some left. I've been to Sammy's several times and had great experiences, especially when the owner is working. He loves his business and it shows in his enthusiasm. I'll be back, buy if that same guy is working, I'll turn around and walk out.",

Need I say more, I loved the pastrami sandwich, a ton of meat and my wife just loved the Greek burger.  The buns for the sandwich and burger held up really well.  Good texture to the buns, not the crappy kind that get flattened and soggy with sauce.  Fries were outstanding.  The counter help was terrific.  Super friendly and and helpful.  He gave us a sample of a blueberry Oreo shake and it was delicious.  Next time.. Oreo Blueberry shake for me.  You get alot of food.  I am a fan!!",

    "text": "Sammy's reminds me of the old burger shack joints in LA like Tommy's Original and maybe McDonalds in the 50's.  Back in the day, you had real good, big beef patties not the factory pressed pink slime molds full of filler and preservatives and nitrates.  The gourmet burger is all the rage these days.  Back when Carl's came out with the $6 burger, people scoffed at even paying $5 for a \"$6\" burger.  Today, nobody blinks an eye paying $5 for a sh tty burger.  The pastrami burger here is $8.  Not a big deal, because it's basically a burger and pastrami sandwich mixed together.  So it's like you bought a $4 burger and added a $4 pastrami sandwich and just got ride of two layers of bread.  I really liked it, because you could taste the pastrami, it was thick and meaty.  Some places like Subways I imagine the pastrami is transparent or just nasty fat with some vein of meat.  This was the real deal.  The only reason I heard about this place was because it was next door to Boiling Crab where I ate.  The one next door was closed so I actually looked this one up and drove across town for it.  The fries were also nice and big, not the skinny ones you get at McDonalds.  It was old-school fries.  This is basically all old-school, getting back to the roots of a good hamburger joint before it all went corporate and turned into Disney-sh t that gives us cancer and makes us obese.  I'm coming back here every trip to Vegas.",

The portions are a really good size to almost to much food depending on what you order. Here is my recommendations.   Chipotle Steak Burger - Great burger - (just don't accidentally order the chipotle burger which is not so good)   The meal fries - both the greek fries and the chipotle steak fries are both great buys and meals enough for two if you buy the regular and 3 if you buy a large.   If you can get past the 1st part of the review then enjoy the second part of the review. As well currently you can buy a deal from yelp getting 20 bucks worth of food for 14.",

Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out.   The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with \"Fried Mozzarella\" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the \"Garlic Romano Fries\" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of \"The L.A. Pastrami\" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!",

ODD given that the website days open till 11pm and drive thru till midnight.  Also, no custard  shakes.  Disappointing given the marketing about there shakes.  I ordered sandwiches for 4 people and the bill was $66 dollars.  I questioned him 3 times to ensure that I had it right.  $66 bucks.  The sandwiches better be GREAT.    The food is delicious.  The pastrami is great.  Rich with fat bit great.  The value isn't there.  Won't be back",

It was actually pretty fast for a little joint and one cook doing register AND drive through. People are just impatient. This place is the awesome.

It's frustrating that a business is turning away customers. Obviously need to hire more people.   The last time I sat at the window for 15 minutes and she finally came and told me I can go online set up this whole thing and order and then wait about 45 minutes. I'm in the restaurant business and I was floored!   I crave the fully loaded burger all the time and unfortunately I give up and won't be coming back since I don't get to order it anyways.   Sorry you lost us as loyal customers. There's plenty of other places out there that'll work to keep our business not ignore the phone and send us away.",

Mom got the chili cheese fries. The cashier said they were made with ca meaty chili. Mom got like  zero meat in hers. She said they were ok. I tried their chicken tenders with sweet thai chili sauce and garlic fries. Honestly, I didn't expect the tenders to come covered in the sauce but it was ok. Luckily, I hadn't ordered them with ranch lol. I think they would have been better plain. The fries were weird. I couldn't even tell there was garlic oil on the fries Honestly. The fries didn't have a ton of flavor. I got most of the flavor after I was done eating them. Overall, okay food.  The place itself is small but nice. The staff were friendly and accommodating. It seemed a little slow fir the people who ordered after us. One thing that kind of grossed me out was the cashier was handling the trash with her bare hands, took out the trash, then served the food. I REALLLLY hoped she washed her hands somewhere in between.   Would I go back ? Maybe. There are a lot of choices for excellent food here in Vegas.",

The Philly cheesessteak was very tasty, and the BBQ brisket sandwich with provolone was pretty good too. My friend and I each bought one medium sized sandwich and traded halves for maximum variety, which was a solid move. If you ever want to tell your diet to go f**k itself, and enjoy it, this is the place to eat.  Their credit card machine was down, and I had no cash on me, and a nice gentleman by the name of Douglas who was sitting at a table close to the register  eating a large pastrami sandwich and fries got up and payed for my meal in cash. I told him that I couldn't accept his generous offer,  but he insisted on the one condition that I one day also spread this pay it forward attitude, because if everybody did this once for someone else, then the world would be a better place.   It is clear that their food draws in a genuinely nice crowd as well. Will dine again.",

Got the Big Ass Burger, chicken club & garlic fries. All looked great until I tasted the old grease & old bacon on the burger, plus it still needed flavor. And grease continued to poor out of this as if they deep fried it. The chicken club also needed at least salt. Finally I get to the large the fries, looked & smelled great but, No Flavor! Added salt, And still not worth the price. The place also looked like it was on its last legs. Since the drive-thru just looked like a drive-thru with no speaker & a 1/2open window, I parked & walked in.if I were easily disgusted I would have ran immediately just from a few steps in & if I were easily offended I would've ran from the most evil attitudinal lady taking orders & cooking.

I even got around to trying their custard shakes, rib eye steak fries, fried mushrooms, gyro, big ass bacon cheeseburger, corned beef sandwich, and lemonades in the 3.5 years since I wrote that review. In fact, I'll bet my husband and I have eaten there/picked up takeout 25 times since I wrote it. But those days might be over.  The customer service has become literally a joke. Like, we'll have to steel ourselves with jokes about how bad it'll be this time before we walk in the door so we won't boil over with anger. It used to only be bad at night, and then on weekends, and now basically any time, any day. We can be the only customers in the joint, or we'll wait quite a while because they're busy. It doesn't matter. Why should I have to put my \"I'll be nice to you no matter what\"/\"I work retail\" face on *when I'm the customer* because you guys are so rude? It hit me how backwards this was after we headed home and joked about how they must deal with unpleasant/hostile customers. And just forget the drive thru. Come inside.   (I will note that one afternoon/early evening I got great service, but it was because there were 2 people working; it was a relief because I was with my family in from out of town, but that's been literally the only exception. Why is there usually only 1 person working, especially at night? Isn't that dangerous?)  Also, the quality/construction of some of the dishes vary widely depending on when they're made. The meats are usually the same amount (I'm guessing they use a scale), but sometimes the bread will be cut weird, or their special fries will be insanely heavy handed with sauces or the chili... and the next time less than even pictured. I mean I guess it's all about who's making the dish, but over the years you'd think things wouldn't de-evolve, you know what I mean? Especially as prices have gone up (I get it, stuff costs more), you expect at least some regularity.  All in all, their food is delicious. Sometimes I literally crave it. But they make you pay for it, in dollars and patience. See ya, Sammy.",

My boyfriend and I got there around 2pm last Thursday and the place was empty.  The owner, Bryan, took our order and assured us that his place is legit as it was super crowded earlier (not that I doubted him).  He was really friendly and funny and made for some good company while we ate.  Now on to the food, we went with the 502 Fries and the L.A. Style Pastrami Sandwich as well as a fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade and a mango milkshake to wash it all down.  My lemonade was nice and tart, the way I like it.  I also tried some of my boyfriend's shake and it was very custardy and yummy but unfortunately didn't taste mango-y at all (Bryan made a really big batch and was nice enough to give him refills).  Anyway, the star of the meal was definitely the pastrami...sooo delicious!  When Bryan brought out the 502 Fries, my jaw dropped.  That thing was HUGE!!  Together, we ate maybe a third of it before giving up.  I couldn't even touch the pastrami sandwich (my boyfriend did finish his half though so kudos to him).  We left Sammy's stuffed and armed with leftovers for dinner (they still tasted surprisingly good 5 hours later, lol).  I'm really glad I found Sammy's through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>...next time I'll have to remember to bring at least two more people with me and attempt to finish the beast known as The 502 Fries ;)",

One Lady working cleaning tables and cooking and taking orders she was doing her best but very short handed because of this every plate came out at differant times.  No forks or knives i guess owner was showing up around 5 pm to bring some plastic ones she mentioned.  Bottled water was from local super market and 1/4 of sodas were out.  Obvious this business is not a priority of owner or owners. Pastrami sandwhiches were decent and seasoned fries,  oil was probably not hot enough to cook the onion rings they were soft and not much flavor.    Very limited seating and patio was not set up so if maybe more than two more familys had shown up they wouldnt have a place to sit occupancy of building is max 10-12 . No garbage can to throw leftover napkins or waste after eating . Felt bad after we left people in line but all tables dirty but no one to clean them cause she was taking orders.  Decent place to order food to go.  Owners get it together!! Food is good enough to make this place great if you pick up all the peices and put some pride into this place.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place since I had seen it in my Entertainment Book and it's close by my office.  I don't care for Pastrami, so I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak.  The guy with the glasses did talk up the Pastrami, the fries, drinks, and claimed that they were the best in town. (A bit too much if you ask me)  We ordered to go because we had to get back to the office. Yes, the place is sort of a dump inside and small but sometimes those places are good.  I was a bit turned off when the guy got up on the counter to turn up the air conditioner that is jutting out of the wall.   When we got back to our office, we opened our styrofoam boxes and were shocked (and disgusted).  The phillys were drowning in yellow processed cheese (almost soupy). I have never had a philly like this and did not expect it at all. I couldn't hardly eat it because it was so messy. The meat was tender and flavorful but you couldn't get over the amount of cheese that it was swimming in. Very salty, messy and not worth the trouble.   I hear that is how they make them in West Philly....remind me to never go there for a steak sandwich.   Sorry...you aren't the best in town and I don't think I can bring myself to coming back....just too much cheese for this girl.",

I haven't been on here in about 9 months because I moved to the other side of town and I would say it used to be one of the best munchies place in town.  First off the place looked dirty and the ac was leaking into a cup on the counter.  The cook was taking the order and he was rude and upset that we were there. Milkshake was too sweet, the okra was tasteless and it was raw, the pastrami burger was greasy and disgusting and gyro was dry.  All in all was a big fail, I am really disappointed because this place was so bomb.",

I've eaten at the location at the other side of town (Decatur and Flamingo) a few years ago and thought it was ok, but when I stopped buy this location a week ago there was only one employee working and he was too busy arguing with a customer at the drive through window to acknowledge me.  I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes before leaving.  I tried again tonight.  This time I was sort of acknowledged, but it took about 4 minutes.  The guy seemed to be cleaning the grill or something more important and didn't seem interested in taking my order... I'm thinking that it's because he'd have to do even more work.",

    "text": "Been here about 3 or 4 times in the past and when I point it out to people, they are usually like \"Ohhh..that place looks likes its closed\".  Haha, about as far as you can get from closed actually. I swear the menu has new items every time I go.    Unfortunately I\"m not a pastrami fan so I can't comment on it's namesake, but I can say that I am a big ass bacon cheeseburger fan.  That is one of the burgers on their menu. It's dinner, then breakfast, and even sometimes lunch the next day.  Are you ready for this?   1, or 2 if your up for it, 1/2 lb burger patties, 1/4 lb cheddar cheese, 12(TWELVE(A DOZEN)) strips of bacon in between a bun.  Epic Meal Time would be proud of this burger.  8.49.  or 10.99 for a double.    Ok so my second favorite burger is the italian.  It's a couple patties, about 1/4 to 1/2 lb of sliced italian beef, white cheese, and their oh so good giardiniera.  Under 10 bucks.  Their fries are really good as well. Lots of seasoning, and some are even meals themselves.  They got homemade lemonades, shakes, teas, they even got shaved ice.  I've been inside to order once and the guy behind the counter is really cool.  And if you're gonna hit the drive thru, you can call first and have it ready because everything takes a bit to prepare.  I think I might stop later today and try the zombie burger.",

Very good at making recommendations, and he wasn't lying when he said \"We don't embellish the word 'large'\". The onion rings are top notch, and quite a bit better than the ones I had at Badger's Cafe up the street.  I can't really compare this to Five Guys, because they're two completely different ballgames. It's nice to have another take-out place that varies though, so I don't burn out on one or the other!",

Two single bacon cheeseburgers, a large plain fry and two chocolate shakes were just over $32. I asked for a receipt and was told they don't give them. WTF? If I was alone, I would have just cancelled and left right then for that alone. Burger patties were way over cooked but the cheese was cold and grainy. I had to wipe the grease off the bun before eating and the shakes tasted like the milk was old. I wont try them again.",

The owner working that day was a total sweetheart and neglected his meal to help me out (I came in for a 5PM lunch)...he offered suggestions and was very helpful, and I settled on the Pastrami meal fries = with cheese, pastrami, chili and jalepenos...yum.  It is enough for 3 meals at least, and both him and the chef in the back offered to go boxes with a grin.  I also got free refills on my coke, and while tending to the drive-thru, the person got a massive fresh lemonade refilled while waiting for his to go order! I was impressed.  A cute family was eating in there while I was there, and the little girl told me I was pretty.  That pretty much made my day.  I know eating fries for a meal was delicious and all but I will come back and try some sandwiches because they sound outstanding!  Definitely a good experience and I will be back!!",

I was expecting really good sandwiches, well they turned out to be as average as average comes.  The onion rings were the best thing, and they were only decent. The bacon cheddar fries where one big glob of cheese, soaking wet fries, and some sort of mystery looking government meat.  for all the hype this place gets I gave to say it really falls short. Its an average sandwich shop.  Only wasy I would ever go back to give them a second shot is if someone else was picking up the tab. was really wanting to like this place since i live nearby.

    "text": "I went to Sammy's after my friend and I saw it featured on some TV show. I went there years ago, but wasn't too wowed by it to go back or write a review. So, now that it's fresh in my mind, here's my honest review.   First, I'll start off with the negatives. The shop is small and looks very run down. The drive thru intercom doesn't work and there is a piece of paper covering the menu that says to pull up to the window to order. Seems very ghetto. It could definitely use a facelift. You'd probably think it was closed if it weren't for the giant advertising posters pointing you into the lot. The lot itself is small and parking can become limited very quickly.  If you're going to the drive thru, expect a long wait. I've had to park my car and turn it off both times I've been there. If you see someone sitting at the window already, don't even bother: you'll probably be waiting there forever and they don't have the decency to tell you to move your car so that they may take additional orders. The whole process seems very disorganized.  Despite all of the negatives, however, Sammy's serves up some delicious food and in huge portions! Even if you've got an appetite, I'd order something to share instead of individual plates. It might also ease of the blow of the pricey menu. There have been a lot of complaints about customer service, but the service I received was great.  Overall, Sammy's stinks when it comes to their visual appeal, but if you're willing to wait for a delicious, fatty meal, this is your place.",

    "text": "Stumbled across Sammy's this afternoon and was psyched when i first noticed their banner with what appeared to be several humongous burgers, What piqued my interest most however was their Gyro special. Lets start-off with drinks, As explained to me by the nice lady who took my order apparently their drinks are somewhat pricey-er starting at the $2.79+ range for lemonade however their 'small' cups are actually 24oz which i found pretty awesome despite being mostly ice; That being said after trying their 'Mango Lemonade' i almost wanted to chug a gallon of water, The lemonade was overly sweet with an almost concentrated texture and the quality of the lemons used, tasted more like Key-Limes to me also it didn't appear to have any actual mango presence.  Being from the East-Coast we're used to always having fries with our Gyro's, Its unethical to have it any other way. Needless to say today i was really dissapointed by Sammy's, I'm still trying to figure out what Gyro or Burger place actually sells Gyros without fries? Its simply unorthodox specially when pricing seems to be less-frugal. I paid $15 ($22 total) for a Gyro that didn't even come with fries or tzatziki sauce honestly i'm all about supporting our local joints but this one really let me down big-time, Instead of tzatziki sauce i received what appeared to be some odd thick white cream/paste which wasn't very good and had somewhat of an off putting flavor.   Needless to say after today's experience i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth [no pun intended], When it comes to GOOD food i certainly have an open wallet but in this case the price simply DOES NOT justify the food received; I feel that for anyone to pay $15 for a plain gyro is almost insulting specially when a 10lb sack of potatoes is only $1.99; As a business-owner myself i refuse to see how adding fries to the meals hinders this restaurants profit margins in any way.",

My experience at the drive thru made me really feel bad for your lady working the window. She seemed over worked and stressed out much more than anyone should have to feel. With three cars in the drive thru a dining room full of people and all kinds of door dashers this lady was up to her head. I noticed many people complaining about the customer service and with how busy your employee is it's no wonder shes sl busy doing too peoples jobs its hard to do it with a smile.

Drove up to the drive thru waited 6 minutes until someone finally came up to the window. She then asked what i wanted i told her i had place an online order with attitude she preceded questioning what company i told her through the main restaurant website she said no i showed her my email receipt and stated with oh i don't have your order. Ok so i asked what now i had already placed the order and paid online about 45 minutes ago. Said she hadn't recieved it and hadn't checked her online emails... ? They need better associates with better customer service and to be attentive to their drive thru window. Finally she asked to see the receipt to write down my order. So it took a whole hour for me to get my order from placing it to driving up to the drive thru and finally driving off with my order. And they say if we don't want to wait we can order ahead of time? Ordered it online and still had to wait an additinal 30 minutes....wow great customer service!!! (Being sarcastic) their service is getting worse and worse. Used to be my go to spot for pastrami im having to re think that!",

After about 15 minutes I just walked out, and not sure if even want to go back to tru the food... Very Disappointed.  TLDR: poor service, long wait, 1 over-worked employee, didn't get to try food.

Got there just right after 11pm so dining area was closed.  However, drive thru was still open til 2am.    We went to the drive thru and looked at the menu.  It was a little hard to see because of the lighting so we got out of the car and just stood there reading the menu.  There is so much to choose from making it hard to decide on what we want to get.    We finally decided and made our way to the window to order. We got the chipotle steak burger, pastrami melt, garlic Romano fries, large root beer float, and a pomegranate lemonade.    The chipotle steak burger was spicy.  If you can't take the heat then that is not a burger for you.  It packed a lot of flavor but a bit too spicy for me.    The pastrami melt was good but got a little too salty after awhile because it was loaded with pastrami.  A bit on the greasy side.  Garlic Romano fries - shoe string fries with some garlic and romano flavor.  Really thin and crispy but not much flavor.    The pomegranate lemonade was pretty good, a bit sweet but that comes from the pomegranate syrup.    Root beer float large came with like half a tub of ice cream.  The cup was literally full with ice cream.  The key to this place is everything must be huge portions.",

The owner, Brian, doesn't take lightly to food being nasty. He has worked on the lemonade recipe alone for a very long time. The food has taken some of the best flavors from around the country, and put it all into a small joint. The food is absolutely worth the drive from any part in the valley. Some may say the food is too \"greasy\" or too \"fatty\", but that's why you don't eat there every single day. You go there, get some delicious food with a few friends that will leave you with great memories, and a full and happy belly then come back a few weeks later with some new friends!   You can seriously throw a dart at the menu and hit something that will taste amazing. I recommend this place to everyone. Even if you're a picky eater, just go an get the chicken fingers.",

I saw this place on the Food Network and both me and my husband starved ourselves through the whole 5 hr drive to get there just so we would be hungry enough for the giant portions they showed on tv.. I'm glad I didn't have anything in my stomach when we got there because the smell alone would have made me hurl.. This was not sewage but old burnt dirty grease like the place hadn't been cleaned in years and it took about 45 minutes to get our food which looked amazing but tasted like the place smelled.. The sandwiches were huge but I couldn't make up my mind so I got the Split Decision which had both corned beef and pastrami on it with mustard and pickles.. It tasted like a ham sandwich only soaked in grease.. Now the fries were amazing they were the garlic Romano fries.. I can't tell you how much the only reason this got a three star rating was for the milkshake.. This milkshake was awesome. I got the mocha caramel shake and it was heaven in every sip.. I would only come back to get the fries and milkshakes.. And only in the drive through so I don't have to smell the yucky dirty grease smell that permeates the entire building and wafts out onto the patio..",

    "text": "Being my first time here, it was.......... OK! My boyfriend was the one who suggested it. He heard from other people that the food was good, but it was a little pricey. Trying to find the place was easy. It's about 5-8 minutes away from where me and my boyfriend live.   As soon as we found it, to me it was a little odd. It being like a hole in the wall kind of shop. My first thought was it only had a drive thru. Going thru  to find the order board, i noticed a box, thinking it was the ordering box. Come to find there was a sign saying to drive to the window after we know what we want. So we take a few minutes look at what they got, and figure out what we want to eat.   I got the BACON PASTRAMI SANDWICH with GARLIC ROMANO FRIES. My boyfriend got the PASTRAMI FRIES and the PASTRAMI BURGER.  The portion was a good size. My fries was the skinny fries seasoned in garlic salt. My sandwich was like a loaf of bread you would get at subway, almost, with layers of pastrami, onions, mustard, provolone cheese and bacon. I think the sandwich said with tomatoes but never have any.   When we were done, we drove up to the window. Had one car in front of us. They waited about 8-10 min for their food. While we were waiting the guy comes out the door and takes our order. At first we're like ok?! so we put in our order, my boyfriend asks for mayo no mustard and the guy makes a sarcastic comment about how they\"re rated the best in vegas, and their pastrami is juicy that you don't need mayo and asked if we own a very popular shop?. Then he said NO I DO!. So we just kept ordering and let it pass by. Finally it was our turn to get our food. We probably waited about 10-15 minutes more from when we were behind the car in front of us. It got to the point where i literally turned off my car for about 5 minutes.  They slowly started getting busy. The parking was limited. then finally we got our food.   overall I must say the experience wasn't that great. Waiting long for our food, having a sarcastic food server, and the space being small. Not to mention the ordering system was nothing of a fast food joint. But i must admit the food was good, filling and tastey.. Might go back again for the food. But not looking forward to the service. That is why i give it 4 stars.",

I would order the sandwich and shake again in a heartbeat. Fries were average.  The most memorable part of our visit was the guy running the place for the night. We were sorry we didn't catch his name since he was awesome, kind and made our experience even better .",

    "text": "This place is kind of crazy, and when I first walked in  there, the manager was having a pretty funny argument with an out state idiot who was insulting Las Vegas for no reason.   I didn't know what to make of it, but I had a old <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for this place, and my friends wanted to eat Pastrami in a very bad way.   So I looked at the guy, and told him could I order, and have a nice day.    Everyone sitting down in the small dining room, gave me a look of Oh no...but I didn't care, I was beyond hungry, and so was my friend and her daughters.    I don't know if he left because I was trying to be cool, or maybe he could feel my friend was about to go on a  PMS induce rage on him if he stood in her way of ordering.   Well, the guy jumped in his Arizona licensed Oldsmobile, and burned rubber out on Tropicana.  Sadly, he got a ticket from a Metro officer who was nearby in the other parking lot..   Oh well.  When I finally got to the counter, it was a task in figuring out what to eat, because the menu is set up with a unique selection of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs.   I didn't know what to choose between a Pastrami burger or that monster cheeseburger.    My friends choose the Pastrami burgers, but I went for the Big Ass bacon cheeseburger, and we shared the large order of fried Mozzarella, and the Garlic Romano fries.      Our order came out in 15 minutes, and I was taken back on the size of this burger.   It was ridiculous in size, and I have to admit it took two meals to put it down.   I really like it, and the only other burger I liked better than this at the time was at Create (which sadly closed).   The fries were good, but my friend told me it not up to the quality and standard of her former work place called, the dive (the old fashion show mall....she always does that)  but she still enjoyed them.      The manager/owner was very cool, and didn't add on the 18%  to my bill for that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, and because of that we got a couple of milkshakes for her daughters.   I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good Hand scooped milk shake, and Sammy's did make a good one.     Finally, I been to The Hat in Monterey Park, and I have say Sammy Pastrami is very close to them as far as flavor for their trademark name.    Sammy does cut their meats a little thicker, but it's still a good corned beef.    If you're asking why a four star?   The parking sucks, and the place is very small, also it hard to turn into coming from Henderson.....but in the end...I'm a pretty big fan of this place.",

Ya know, we stick to the same old same old and she had been to Sammys years ago and remembered it was delicious! So I was at first skeptical, being that the place is 300 square ft. And just the overall appearance looked a bit, \"run down.\" Anyways we decide to eat inside and we were greeted by Sophia. She was very pleasant and helped us with everything we needed. The ranch was homemade and the spicy canjun fries were the bomb!!!! We got the chipotle burgers, French frys, fried egg, cheese, chipotle sauce, and bacon, on a brioche bun. It was absolutely to die for! Very highly recommend this spot to have lunch or dinner. Prepare to leave full! Thanks again Sophia!",

It's a small joint, so it's just two people working most of the time, so the wait was long (upwards to an hour). However, I got the classic LA Pastrami, and it was worth the wait.  A definitive positive is that they take care in everything they make. The sandwich was great. I also got a cherry lemonade and that was also very tasty. I'd say price is justified for the quality.

I had to explain it all over again, the cook was standing behind her. I paid $31, I order chicken basket, chili cheese fries and pastrami burger. Let's just discuss the food it's horrible the pastrami is very fatty and is complete grease. I ate one bite and put it down in the container. My husband had the BBQ chicken basket and it tasted like buffalo sauce. And I paid extra cause there was bacon on top of the fries.  Once I made it home with my meal and we both tasted it I called and left a voicemail with 30 mins. I am there when they open the next day and I tell Anna what the problem was she personally tasted the food, herself. She wanted to argue with me about it being buffalo sauce verse what I ordered which was BBQ. I told her that's why the whole meal is in the box because my husband can't physically eat it. If you eat something and it doesn't taste well or its something wrong with it you return it. If the establishment REFUSES to return my money it's against the law and I will report you on Yelp, the state board, and BBB. Just eat your food before you leave this restaurant they aren't honorable and they don't believe in satisfying their customers.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Vegas for a little R & R. I personally gravitate more towards the \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurants.  So I got out my cell and pulled up the Yelp app and found Sammy's. Since we were staying at the Tropicana (ugghhh) it made sense as Sammy's was just down the road.  Before and when I got there I really had no idea what I wanted. All I did know is I was starving and wanted a bunch of whatever it was gonna be.  Since it was a later dinner, 8ish, the place was pretty empty. The guy behind the counter (Bryan) basically explained the menu. In a nutshell he said they could make anything any way we wanted it.  Bryan ended up talking me into getting the \"502 Fries\" with jalapenos on top. I can't remember what the wife got but it was pretty impressive as well.  I also got a special iced tea of the day type thing and BS'd with Bryan as he worked the drive through.  He tried to talk us into the Vanilla Custard shake. Considering how gargantuan my fries looked like they would be I passed as i didn't want to have to be rolled to the rental car as opposed to me walking to it.  Bryan made one up anyways for himself and saved some on the side for us to try. We were glad he did as it was wicked good.  Just about the time our meal was ready some locals walked. They just kind of looked over and chuckled as my food was set down.  I was warned to not start at the top and pick all the goodies off as my \"left-overs\" would be somewhat blah. He said to start from one end and work my way towards to the other end. That way each bite would have all the goodies.  When I raised the white flag I was told I did fairly good as i had killed off just over 1/3 of the fries. Man I was stuffed!  When it was all said and done, I was very satisfied with the food and company. The locals were pretty cool and talkative.  Don't go here expecting it to be your standard $5 burger joint. It isn't.  My bill for two of us was around $30. Considering how long I was picking at the leftovers in my hotel room it was worth it.  Plus Vegas is a town of \"Excess\" so go with the flow!  To make a long story short, I will return next time I am in Vegas.",

I've spent the last 15 minutes puking. They serve spoiled food and pass it off as fresh. The burger patties are frozen, and the place is not much more than a filthy shack.",

The fries were good, although the chili on them was not desirable. I won't be back, because of the high prices. For a bacon burger/small fries and pastrami burger/small chili cheese fries, it was over $28.

    "text": "We were given gift certificates for this place. Even though it was on the other side of town we ventured one Saturday night to get our dinner there.    Upon first glance it was a small \"house\" looking structure.  Upon opening the door there was an unidentifiable smell.  I would like to think it was the food that was cooking.  Once we took care of the logistics of the $100 in gift certificates we were carrying.  We decided to go for it and order a wide variety of food.  Most of the food is deep fried. I don't regularly eat deep fried so I was cautious.   I really liked the deep fried zucchini.  The batter was a soft bread like batter instead of a bread crumb batter.  It added a bit more bread taste than I was use to but dipped in the ranch it was good.  We also tried the mushrooms with the breading.  These I found too small to have such a heavy breading on them.  It tasted like an overload of breading with a button of mushroom taste in the middle.  I didn't like that.  The onion rings were the best.  They were tasty.    I also don't eat a lot of meat, but I ordered the pastrami to give it a try.  The pastrami itself was good.  It wasn't too thin and it wasn't too salty.  It had a hearty taste.  My sandwich had the egg and bacon with it.  The bacon was overcooked but the egg tasted good on the sandwich.   I was surprised when we discovered they had no restroom. Unfortunately for us, the business next door was already closed so our evening ended with a drive to look for a restroom.    If you like fried and breaded food this is a pretty good place.  The service was good.",

Regular large hot link. I found the link sandwich in its self to be huge and loaded. Would not describe the link alone as spicy myself. Smoothed in nacho cheese on a hoagie size bun with pastrami and jalapenos. Patty melt on rye did not come with sauce. The food was to go it happens. Missing sauce did not take away. Great burger with pastrami included on top and provolone cheese. You can sub cheddar if you like. Burgers are served medium well. Next time I will order my fries crispy. They where a little  greasy and under done though.   many amazon restaurants have a small delivery radius. Its nice they deliver to downtown.",

Nothing boring to describe any of their dishes with! Yeah the establishment is relatively small and the parking is... eh, BUT the food is everything as advertised. Give this place a shot, and like me, after your first bite you will be addicted!!",

I swore off pastrami for over 15 years and Sammy's lured me back in and then addicted me! Sammy's has received Best Of Las Vegas multiple times and I support the accolades as well earned.  WARNING - bring an appetite and don't go if you are dieting. The portions are very generous. We order one large  LA Special for two people and regularly have left overs. Sometimes it is wolfed down because it's that good. The quality of the pastrami is high and the cheese bread etc is also perfect. The fries are popular. I've sworn I will try something else but alas, I have not yet done so despite having eaten here about 100 times. The lemonade is actually awesome and worth ordering - as weird as that sounds. The drinks come in enormous cups. Look and ask questions before you order!",

I believe the name of the burger I ordered is the Chipotle Burger.  To my surprise, this thing was massive.  Meat, egg, fries, cheese all stuffed in between two buns.  This burger was great and I can't describe it enough so you just have to stop by and check it out yourself.  Upon reading the reviews of this place, @AJ d mentioned the 502 fries so my buddies and I decided to order it and they were off the hook. On a side note, ordering a burger and the 502 fries for one person might be a little much so you have been warned.    As for the negative aspect, there is none.  The people that worked there was friendly and very patient as my friends and I stared at the menu.  This place gets a five star rating in my book, and now has become a must stop place every time I end up in Vegas.  This little blue shack on Tropicana is a most definite place to check out for local eateries and a nice place to step out of the typical buffets.",

The original store was opened on Decatur Blvd.  The way we found this restaurant was we were looking for a Dunkin' Donuts but by the time we found one, it was already closed. (Boo!)  Well, we decided to grub somewhere we couldn't find in San Diego and away from the Strip.    Anyways, we found this place through Yelp!  We walked in and we were greeted by Lou.  Dude was cool, very friendly and helped us out with our questions about the menu.    Basically, he said everything on the menu comes in two sizes - big and BIGGER!  No lie!!!! Well, this place is definitely not for anyone who is on a diet or who doesn't have an appetite... the portions here are MEAN!!!  Everything is also made fresh... the fries, the burger patties, the pastrami slices...  I ordered the \"Zombie Burger\".  Why do they call it a Zombie Burger? My guess is that after you finish grubbin, you'll be so dayam full you'll be walkin around like a zombie... That's just a hunch, but f*ck, that's how I felt...   My friends and I also shared an order of 502 Fries... OMG! Delish...   If I were to compare this to another restaurant I've been to, I would say it is similar to Hodad's in San Diego... but, with a lot more selection on the menu...   I was definitely satisfied and I would definitely come back here again... After our first visit here, this place has become a \"must visit\" every time we come to Vegas... Cruise by and see for yourself... but make sure you bring your appetite...  BTW, I have a feeling Guy Fieri will be visiting this place soon so we might be seeing this place in Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives... if he does, well, you'll know this place is legit for sure... :)",

They'd been out of onion rings, since the previous day & a couple choices of soft drinks were out. Once placed, our order came up piecemeal. BBQ French Fries (they were Cajun, but we'd waited too long to quibble). We waited. R's Classic Pastrami with Provolone. We waited. G's Bleu Cheese Pastrami Burger. The food was adequate but, for what we paid, terribly overpriced. Sammy's was on our Foodie List. Not antmore. TravelingbyCarr GandR calls it 1 1/2 stars, at best.",

But man, an extra large pastrami, a medium order of garlic fries and a large lemonade plus tax and tip came out to $30.   It was enough to feed 2 people, but it wasn't cheap.  The four star is for the price.  I don't expect Subway prices but just a little more reasonable and a combo deal that comes out to $12 would be nice.",

(about $41.00 for two people.) He had one of the philly cheesesteaks with grilled onions and mushrooms and I ordered the ranch chicken sandwich. We shared a small order of onion rings and fries. It was the worst food we had ever tasted. Everything was so bland it wasn't funny. Even the bacon on the chicken sandwich had no flavor. We were both extremely disappointed in the food and the total that our meal came out to. Won't be trying them again any time soon.",

Tasted like.... can I switch to a bottle of water. I usually drink water but I enjoy a soda when I'm being a fat ass. Over all a must for those who love a fatty treat when touching down in Vegas",

    "text": "This is NOT a place to practice moderation (I do this during the week), but it's not surprising why this place was featured on the Travel Channel's Food Paradise, \"Drive- thru\" edition, which I saw recently btw (was on this past weekend; funny, we ate here, before even seeing the feature, thanks to <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a>).   Amazing Pastrami here!!! The food is made to order (warm, fresh, good eats), but the wait is well worth it. When we visited, there was one other customer besides us (during lunch). We have a favorite sandwich (we've been to the other location as well), the LA Pastrami (pastrami, mustard, pickles, & melted provolone on good quality rolls), so we were able to use our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate (no longer participating, sad face). Mmm, such \"high quality fast food\" as the owner stated in the feature. The flavor of the pastrami is delicious, the meat is lean, not fatty or greasy. (I've had pastrami at other places so I have a pretty good frame of reference. My fave growing up was Max's in SF, my uncle worked there and we enjoyed the food, good memories too. I do want to try a famous deli down the line, though.) On one hand, you want to take your time, but on the other, you just want to down it. Ranch fries takes the fries to a higher level, what flavor (it is saltier, though; again, this is where you break all your diet rules). Generous portions on the sandwiches, and fries, for that matter. Such a large menu (so many yummy options and possibilities---burgers, chicken sandwiches, melts, pitas, fries & starters, chili fries, wings, strips and shakes besides drinks), but we've gotten the same items because it is that yummy. And you know, we'd probably get the same things next time, too!  The place is small (but clean), could probably be in the \"hole in the wall\" category\" if one just based it on the inside seating (four to six tables, with chairs, maybe?). There is seating outside, as well (umbrellas). And of course, the drive-thru window. The cashier, who was new, was training, but she was very nice. The manager was going through procedures with her.   The website is pretty user-friendly (a plus). You can order online from either location and you can also purchase gift cards online too.  Home of the 502 Challenge: a 6.5 pound meal, 2 pounds of fries, one pound of chili, one pound of steak, one pound of cheddar cheese, and half a pound of grilled onions and jalapenos, at $24.99. Saw this on the Travel Channel feature, too.",

As soon as we walked in this place smelled of sewage!!! The only one older  Hispanic lady working, very rudely said something happened... Ok things happen...  We order 1 sandwich, ranch fries, and 1 custard prep shake. Mind you we are the only customers for about 10min. She hadn't even begun our order. Now a car pulls up in the drive through, they order. We go outside because we can't stand the smell of sewer... I come back in about 35min later, I see she's running around the kitchen, still just only me and the 1 drive thru client... Now about 45min later, I finally ask what's going on. She (the older Hispanic lady) very rudely, almost yelling at me says I should wait more...   Close to an hour later, we get our order, I see she hands 1 sandwich to the drive through order an then ours... It took this lady 50+ minutes to make 2 sandwiches, 1 fries, 1 shake...   Shake was as thin n blended as a milk or even water, the fries were so so so freaking old it almost made u throw up...   The sandwich... Eh, it was ver below average. Most little buger stands can serve the same thing way better...",

    "text": "We decided to give Sammy's a try for lunch based on reviews I skimmed before hand.  We arrived about 11:20 am, and were meeting friends at 12:30 pm on a Thursday.  The time was perfect, a few people came in to pick up orders placed ahead of time, a few people came in and ordered lunch to go, we had our choice of inside tables.  The reviews had already prepared us for service to be a little slow.  Frankly I didn't mind at all, I understand why.  The lady working today was very nice, and when it was our turn at the counter, very attentive.  It is a very small kitchen and if I was the one working in that space, I wouldn't want anyone else in there with me.  It is also why it would be best to work one order at a time, there is not a lot of room to lay out multiple orders in process.  It also means there won't be time for chit chat with a server while you wait, it gave us more time to talk to each other, and we were not rushed about placing the order or eating.  When the food does come out to you, it is worth waiting for.  Portions are more than generous.  Small is good for the average person, medium for a couple, and the large would be good for 3 average adults.  There was no CO-2 for the soda machine today, and it would be nice to have condiments on the tables, but I'm happy to give a solid 4 stars.  The area is fine during the day, and it may not be fancy to look at, but don't let that keep you from giving them a try.",

We never cut into it and decided to return it, something we rarely do.  We had a very hard time getting our money back.  Only standing there won out.  They didn't even return all our money.  There is a broken window and hanging light ballasts, the worst place we have ever been to.  Read the other reviews!",

Thankfully, Sammy's offers smaller versions of their signature an inventive pastrami sandwiches, burgers and other fare. So you can still have a taste of their classic flavors but not explode from consuming every last bite of your pastrami, fries, and famous banana-chocolate custard shake.   A hole-in-the-wall drive-thru (literally), Sammy's also offers counter service inside with a handful of tables as well as patio seating. The menu is larger than the place itself on Tropicana Blvd -- too many menu options, so please refer to my photos of the 4+ page menu.   All food is made-to-order, fresh and delicious with friendly service and reasonable prices for the offerings.   Definitely worth a good walk or short drive off the Strip to enjoy a unique flavor created by locals and not a giant chain. Stop by Sammy's for some sammies and you will be full and happy.",

The right amount of cheese sat atop hot pastrami and pickles, finished with mustard, all on a warm bun.  The only regrettable mention I have was the drive-thru wait.  My first visit found me waiting in the drive for more than 10 minutes.  I am new here so maybe I should have expected this.  Perhaps It is more sit down friendly?  Either way, I will most definitely be going back.  I've heard good things about the 502 Fry.",

    "text": "There's a trio of burger locations in the East Tropicana area of town that are kind of lumped together as classic, 'must have' places to try. I have already visited and been pleasantly surprised by The Dispensary Lounge and The Badger Cafe, it was only a matter of time before I visited Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers. I've received plenty of comments on the three, and have equally read plenty about them on the internet. So after finally closing out the set, how does Sammy's stack up with the rest?  Sammy's has two locations in town, the aforementioned East Side location, and another on the west side of town also near Tropicana. Both locations are basically small shacks, and I was completely surprised to discover that there was actual seating inside the building for customers. The menu has a large amount of completely unhealthy-sounding items like sandwiches, fries, burgers and hot dogs all with an insane amount of toppings you may not expect or just question how they would all fit. This is definitely not the place to visit if you want just a plain burger and fries, as this is clearly not their approach. Kind of reminded me of Rambo's Kitchen actually.  After much deliberation I decided to go with the steak burger: a single patty topped with ribeye steak, grilled onion, bacon, provolone cheese and steak sauce. What came out was just as expected: huge and messy. For such an insanely complicated burger and toppings, the bun is surprisingly well proportioned. It was grilled and crispy, yet soft and gooey inside and very tasty. The steak had good flavor, but the Worcestershire-like steak sauce became far too overpowering about halfway through. The onions and cheese were ok, but not too noticeable in all of the meat flavors. The bacon was a bit too hard; it had ok flavor but again was lost with everything else. The actual burger patty had very generic beef flavor and was very dry. You're clearly getting this for the novelty and toppings, and not the patty unlike Sammy's two local rivals which really thrived on the quality of their meat. While some people may like a giant, messy burger with too many toppings, I prefer something a little simpler and dare I say, healthier than this offering. While the flavors were all good, it was a bit much.  The garlic romano fries were decent; the heaps of seasonings on my skinny fries were enough to make my hands even filthier than they already were from the overly sloppy burger. They were good for a while, but by the end when they got cold they weren't really the same. And believe me, even the small is more than enough for one person, and if you're eating them with a burger you won't give them the proper attention while you're trying to handle all your toppings.  My next issue is the cost; sure you're getting quite the serving size and an excessive amount of toppings, but my meal came to $14.78 with burger, fries and drink. If you're strictly comparing this to the other two from this grouping, it's more than double the cost and not in the running. Even not comparing this to the other two, I'm not sure if I would pay this much just because there's too much going on for me. Maybe I'm too much of a burger purist? I like a quality burger, not an attraction with insane toppings, and that's exactly what you get here. If you're into extravagant toppings, by all means visit Sammy's, but if you're looking for just a quality burger at an amazing price, either The Dispensary Lounge or The Badger Cafe are your best bets in this grouping.",

Five Guys, which is a great burger isn't allowed through the door.   Sammy's has the BEST BURGER I have ever had.   Which one? You ask....   Pick One, is the answer.   I am working my way through the menu, Pastrami Burger, Classic Burger, Fat Assed Bacon Cheese Burger, Zombie Burger, the last one I ate was the Chipotle Steak Burger and have yet to find one that I don't follow by saying Oh My God, that was the BEST BURGER I ever had.  ROOKIE MISTAKES? Sure I have made a few.  Ordering the fries by Myself, was definitely one of them. Make no mistake, the fries are GREAT, even plain (not to mention the many awesome flavors you can get them in) but they are huge, tasty, and gone! Leaving you with the BEST BURGER ever and maybe not quite enough room to place it all. So, don't be a rookie and order fries unless you brought backup. A friend or two, means you can enjoy the BEST BURGER EVER and the fries too! Bryan is a character, fun loving and easy going, But asking for ketchup may get you in trouble.... When he tells you the fries can stand on their own, believe him! (Sneak the ketchup when he isn't looking if you have to!)  After enjoying the best burger of your life, you will be completely full and MIGHT be tempted to get up and walk out feeling completely satisfied. It would be a mistake. You wouldn't know about the hole left in your soul, unless you order a shake to go. THE BEST SHAKE I have ever had. Chocolate, strawberry..... Pick a flavor of delicious happiness to sip on. It will change the way you look at the world - it IS that good.",

Well when we went there, first it wasn't busy so that was a warning sign I should've noticed. Place is tiny, only 4 tables but it was not busy at all so finding a table was easy. My gf ordered the cheeseburger, I ordered the pastrami & we shared chili cheese fries. I also got a strawberry, banana smoothie. What I didn't know, I was paying full restaurant prices as our food total for that meal was almost $40. I was shock how expensive it was for a fast food place. We waited like 15 mins for our food. When we got it, it was ok, not worth the wait or price. The pastrami really had no flavor, the bread was too crispy where they toasted it too long. My gf burger was just any generic burger you can get at any burger place. The chili cheese fries were pretty good & smoothie was good also but pretty big. It's not bad just is not good at all which I definitely would not come again.",

Go during the day and treat yourself to a killer pastrami, awesome fries (my favorites are the Cajun and the Garlic fries), and super friendly service.

The guy didn't come to the window for 7 minutes. Then he asks us to wait another couple of minutes to take our order. At that point we should have left. But I was curious as to see what the rave was all about on the Travel Channel. When we finally get our order taken. We ordered a Pastrami Sandwich and Garlic Fries. Not only was the wait to order long the time to get our food was even longer. Total time 25 minutes, no I'm not joking. As any fast food eating American would do we pulled out the Garlic Fries and took a few out while we were driving away. Yes they were hot as expected. But they were so salty and hardly any garlic flavor. We were expecting minced garlic and to our surprise it was only garlic salt with more salt - YUCK. The pastrami was very thinly sliced but was very fatty. Not typical of \"LA Style Pastrami\" as advertised. The sandwich roll was hard and not fresh. Could it get any worse - YES, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as I asked, so the pickle juice made the inside bread soggy. I do not like pickles on my sandwiches. The portion of pastrami was very skimpy.  IMO - This place is not worthy of any publicity on national TV. It is expensive and the food is CRAP.

Seems like there is either a lot of take out or delivery services happening here.  We were the only customers in the joint from 4-5:15 pm.  Three people came in and picked up food that was ready for them without waiting.    We were prepared for a long wait and in spite of the many negative reviews, we were gonna eat here. Love a good Reuben and Pastrami Burger.  Maybe next time we'll try the Gyros.  We were not disappointed by the food.    It was very good for greasy dive food.  My Pastrami Burger was so hot it burned my mouth when I bit into it.  Fresh and hot is a rarity these days.  The Reuben was good, but although it's supposed to have 1000 island on it, we didn't notice much.    I tried to order onion rings with my burger, but was quickly told they don't have them.  I tried to ask if the Greek Fries (one of their specialties) were too much for a side and she cut me off before I could get the question out saying \"yes it is\".    We ordered a single Pastrami Burger, medium fries, and large chocolate shake along with a Reuben, small fries and a medium root beer float.  Our total was $48.54.  The drinks were the same size when they came out.  There were way too many fries.  We could have split a small.  Fries were very good, nice-size cut with light seasoning and very crispy outsides.  There is no accountability.  We were never given any paper showing what we ordered or how much each item was.  So we couldn't tell if we really had the size drinks we ordered.  We are also wondering if we were charged correctly.  Nonetheless I despise chain restaurants and adore one of a kind places.  That means the \"A\" health rating and delicious food are all I need.    See my pics.  They need window shades or even an old sheet in the bare, West facing windows.  We sat in direct sun for a long time before getting our food, drinks first, then sandwiches, then fries.    All the hype on TV shows a young owner guy cooking food, but in our experience it was one lady running the whole show while jabbering away in Spanish on a Bluetooth earpiece the whole time.  Many helpers would gripe about her interactions with customers, and we do wonder if her math skills were up to snuff on our total bill.  This lady was working non stop the whole time. She prepared everything we ordered and brought it out to us.  I guess if you think of this place as a food truck without wheels, your expectations would be spot on.  It's not much bigger.  We will return.  Food was very good.",

We went around 3pm, no line and food was quick. We used the Vegas entertainment book app and got the buy one get one $8 off. They are a tad pricey for being a smaller kind of run down looking building but it's worth the price!",

There is an abandoned dry cleaners building next door, and a tool place next door? So you park in driving areas...that block the entrance from Tropicana.   This is a very small restaurant, old, extremely run down and just not clean. There's only 1 lady behind the counter cooking and taking orders, there's only one other couple in here ahead of us - they have already ordered and sat down.   We are at the counter standing there for nearly 5 minutes with not even an acknowledgement. I'm already ansi and ready to go (my boyfriend is the more patient and forgiving one) and opted to stay because he really wants to try it.   So we wait another 10 minutes til she cooks the meal of the party in front of us, before she even says hi, or takes our order. I'm pretty understanding, but customer service wise - just say hi, acknowledge that you know where here and that you'll be right with us. I can see that you're by yourself..that would've left a better impression. (Tangent, sorry Im still hangry and waiting for my food.) By no means was she rude, once she actually started talking to us, possibly just frazzled.   We are sitting at one of the tables, I don't believe their air conditioning is working, 2 fans running and it's hot!  We waited another 15 minutes for our order to be ready. The food was delicious, soo good. Way more meaty than I expected! I was hot, sweating, uncomfortable in every way possible, but I'm glad we stayed. Next time I will definitely just pick up, or get it delivered!",

Hubby had the 502 sandwich and I had their Philly cheesesteak with cheddar cheese sauce, with added mushrooms. They don't skimp on the quantity of meat. I tasted the pastrami on hubby's sandwich and it was really lean. If I ever come back again I will definitely get that. Hubby also ordered their custard shake and that was also delicious. It was very creamy and not overtly sweet.  The service was definitely lacking. Very bad customer service. The lady was not friendly or helpful at all. We felt we were a bother to even be there. So I didn't order anymore than that one sandwich even though I had wanted to try other dishes too. I think we found the secret to getting just decent customer service at least. That is to order for pick up. This lady only services one customer at a time. I saw 2-3 cars pull away from the drive-thru from waiting there too long while she was cooking our food.   Next time, we will phone our orders in and see if the service will be different.",

Short story: we played it safe and got bacon cheese burgers and shared medium Romano Garlic fries (myself and my husband) and a chicken basket w/ regular fries for our son. Food was ok. Minus the chicken, tasted a bit freezer burned and like the oil needed to be changed.  The garlic fries could have been better but the Romano and garlic flavors were a bit over powering. I didn't mind it too much. The burger was piled high with hearty bacon, massive amounts of cheese and the bun itself was tasty.   I did notice the gentleman working the counter was alone. He was manning all stations, register, grill, phone and drive thru. I saw he ignored a car because he was dealing with someone at the counter. I made a note to make sure I enter the door. Not only to make sure I'm serviced, but because I feel that had I not been able to stare at the man, he would not have washed his hands while preparing our food. I saw him wipe his hands on his jeans a couple times and made sure I had a clear view of the food prep.   the lemonades are pretty awesome)",

We planned the trip months in advanced, so I had time to plan my food destinations and this was one of the top ones on my list. I saw it on the food network and it combined two of my most favorite foods...Burgers and Pastrami! I had to try it!  The first thing I noticed walking in was the huge menu! I was overwhelmed by the amount of items that they had to offer and wanted to try everything! Of course I opted for the Pastrami Burger...a triple one! This thing was huge, but very, very delicious! I was so happy that I had a huge smile on my face after the first bite. My buddy and I also ordered the gyro fries, which was basically a gyro sandwich all on top of french fries! That alone was a meal in itself! The portions they serve are huge...and I eat a lot. I would highly recommend this place the next time you are in Las Vegas! I know I'm going back and getting even more items to try next time! :)",

No hot dogs anymore and when I received my fries, which were $7.49 btw for a medium order of garlic romano fries, they were no longer 'shoestring' they were a small bag of soggy regular fries covered in cheap parmesean cheese, definitely not romano like before. They were absolutely gross. I went in and inquired about the fries, the menu still states they are shoestring. The lady at the counter first denied that the menu said it then, once another customer validated me by showing her, she then admitted they had changed their fries recently. I asked for my money back and also pointed out that there was a $1.00 credit card transaction fee she had neglected to inform me about, so I went ahead and informed the other customers waiting in line prior to leaving, they were also unaware. I won't ever go there again. What a bummer, this place used to be a valley gem.",

Being from Detroit wanting corn beef sandwich all the time. This place suffice oh so well. My daughter had a plain ole cheese burger and ate it all mind you she never eats burgers u less its Mickey d's. So that's saying something. The lemonade is real fresh not sweet with sugar but makes you wanna go to hot dog on a stick and tell them talk slippin!! But serious I am so pleased to have driven by and came across this place bathe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is my table was wobbly with cardboard under but hey I didn't go for the decor I came for the big portion of reasonably priced amazing pastrami. Did I mention they had pastrami!!!",

Last time I drove there 20 mins and the owner turned bipolar he was breaking things and yelling to the worker that he won`t make more food.

The pastrami sandwiches were \"ok\" (average at best), but I was expecting a lot more after hearing all the great things about this place (after all, they were featured on the Food Network, as well as other media outlets). Also, the sandwiches were pretty small. I seriously don't mind paying $12 for a good-sized sandwich, but these were barely worth $5. For the price, I will not return to this place.  Oh yeah, here's another thing: Their stereo speakers are blown. They need to take care of these A.S.A.P. Considering the place is just a stand and their food is being sold at the prices they're asking, I'm sure they have enough money to buy a new set of speakers. The owners must be cheap.  The bottom line: Don't believe everything you see on the Food Network. Either that or somewhere along the line, the quality of their food went downhill.",

    "text": "This is definitely not food you should be eating everyday or even every week for that matter, but it is downright delicious. The place is more like a shack and the interior is tiny, with only 4 tables. Generally, the owner Brian runs the front of house and he is very entertaining and talkative. However, the last time we were there, there was only 1 guy running everything and he was super overwhelmed and we waited quite awhile. He was very apologetic and friendly and I honestly felt horrible for him because he was so slammed. But, the food is always worth the wait!  I usually get the pastrami sandwich, and it is truly fantastic. It is great for Las Vegas, but wouldn't hold a candle in New York. I have also tried the Italian beef sandwich, it had a great kick to it and was very tasty. I like to pair my sandwich with the garlic Romano fries as they are crispy and perfect. They also serve fries covered with meat that can serve as a meal. They are amazing if you can find some friends to share with. The chili on the fries is delicious and pairs well with the steak and pastrami. Of course you might feel pretty terrible after, but they are so good. They also have creamy and delicious milkshakes that are definitely worth a try.   Tip: You do not need to order anything in the large size! The small is a large in any other restaurant and the large is mindbogglingly huge. I also recommend going across the street to the Pinball Hall of Fame for a perfect date night!",

So when my boyfriend suggested we go there for dinner I was definitely up for it...we ordered the pastrami chili fries and let me tell you the portions are HUGE! The one order of chili fries was enough for us to share and still had plenty leftover to take home. The food was really good and tasty and I really enjoyed it ...and the only reason I'm not giving them a 4 star rating is because the overall appears of this place. It looks run down and somewhat dirty inside. If they were to clean it up and make it look nice it would be a lot more welcoming. I also didn't like the fact that their hour sign indicate that they closed 10pm and the cook was rushing some customers that walked in at 9:12pm and as soon as he handed the people their order, he put up the closed sign on the door and it was only like 930pm...so be sure to call before heading there just in case they decide to close early",

I had gotten the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gc, despite the fact that I had to spend $50 in order to get my discount AND it had to be dine-in only.  I had done my research and learned that Sammy's was basically a shack w/ 4 tables inside and some outdoor tables as well.  I was a bit worried about having to dine in cuz I had my lil ones w/ me and didn't know if we'd have to eat outside in 100+ degrees.  So being the mom that I am, I decided that we'd get to Sammy's at exactly 11a (when it opened) and hoping to be the first ones there to get an inside table.  We got there at 11:15a and sure enough we were the first there.  In fact, they didn't even unlock their front doors yet!  We got in, and the place had a/c on full-blast.  We even had to go back to the car to get jackets for the kids, they were freezing.  But this in no way is a complaint!  I was thankful for the a/c.    We ended up getting a ton of food.  -2 LA-style Pastrami sandwiches:  hubby loved it, SIL said it was only ok. -garlic fries: YUM, crispy thin fries with lots of seasoning -fried zucchinis: looked like chicken nuggets but w/ zucchinis inside of course, pretty good, loved the breading -buffalo chicken wings: unfortunately this wasn't that good, the sauce is very light.  basically it was fried chicken wings w/ tabasco-style sauce poured over them -zesty ranch chicken wings:  i actually liked these but a tad too salty, once again, it's just really fried (i.e crispy) wings w/ a ranch flavored powder dusted over them.  When I ordered them, I had an image of wings covered in ranch dressing goo.  Their version was probably the better choice anyway! -chicken gyro sandwich:  this was for me since I couldn't eat beef.  It's pretty much hearty portions of marinated chicken wrapped in a pita bread covered with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and tzatziki sauce.  Messy to eat but yummy. And finally the much-hyped strawberry lemonade:  nice and refreshing.  it definitely got a \"two thumbs up\" from my kids, they drank more than they ate!  A final note regarding dining w/ kids.  This is definitely best for take-out.  Although we had to dine-in, I wouldn't recommend it again in the future for my family.  There were no high-chairs and really nothing that shouts out \"kid-friendly\".  I will definitely come back to visit this place again but it will be through the drive thru!",

They have a fry plate called The Three Squares Fry. Really to call this a fry plate is quite an understatement. It's a freakin' enormous, even ridiculous amount of heart stopping, artery clogging deliciousness...not to be taken lightly.   Here's the ingredients: A pound of fries (probably on the heavy side) with a half pound each of pastrami & grilled rib eye, chili, cheddar, grilled onions, and 1/4lb of grilled bacon, onions & jalapenos, and two over-medium fried eggs. Did I mention this thing is enormous?   This mountain of food still did not put me over $20 so I had to order a Dr.Pepper Ice Cream Float. This was also phenomenal. It was at least a quart of Vanilla Ice Cream and a lot of Dr. Pepper thrown into a blender and dumped into a 44oz Styrofoam jug.   Needless to say, I could not finish it, but I gave it a hell of a try.   I would recommend this place to anybody with a huge appetite and a desire to test their limits. The food is FANTASTIC and the people are a lot of fun. Even if the fries aren't for you, they have plenty of options and the guys will offer plenty of suggestions...just tell 'em what you like.   TWO BIG, and now Fatter Thumbs Up!!!",

We planned on the drive thru and tried calling ahead for faster service. We called four times on the drive over only to have no answer and a voicemail. We pull up in the drive thru, our order is taken and we wait 25mins before we see the worker again. He handed us our food and then wanted to take care of the bill. We had a coupon which he gave us a hard time about and told us we should have given it to him sooner. Well- you should take care of the bill before you give us our food and it gets cold in the car. That was wrong... He took about 5mins after we gave him the coupon to even come back and tell us the new total. We gave him the money and we even received wrong change back. I was hungry and at this point level 10 fuming that we were in a drive thru for what ended up being a half hour for a sandwich. He got a pastrami which he loved, and i got a Philly cheese steak. When looking at the menu and it mentions peppers on a Philly, one will always assume bell peppers because that is the norm. Nope, onions and jalapenos, not what i expected. They also kept the seeds in which made some bits quite spicy. I will not be ordering that again. Overall, I was more displeased than I can ever recall with a food service. Oh, and at the drive thru wall, there is a sign stating to call ahead for faster service. That would be nice if they would pick up the phone. I doubt I will be going back here anytime in the near future. The place has the potential for greatness but poor service trumps all...",

I didn't like the taste of the steak because of how it was seasoned plus it seemed slightly dry so I ate the burger without it.  The garlic romano fries were crispy and shoestring style.  The onion rings were crunchy and beer-battered.  I could have just eaten those two things and skipped the burger.  Food wasn't overly greasy and the cook was very friendly.

    "text": "Searched Yelp for a good pastrami sandwich shop in Vegas. Thanks to all of the Yelpers for the great find. I doubt I would have eaten at Sammy's without the great reviews because from the outside...Sammy's doesn't look like much. The food is a 4.5 and the dining area is a 3. The pastrami is moist and the bread is soft and tasty. One of the better pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. I also had their garlic fries which was really good as well.",

I went twice when who I believe to be the owner was there. He is just ignorant and rude, to say the least. I was there two other times and there was a gentlemen I could hardly understand, who obviously couldn't understand me either, because both times, he got my order wrong. Then there is the food. Burgers are burgers. Nothing special until you order specialty burgers, then that is where the gamble comes in. The first time I was there, a couple years back, (owner provided poor service this visit) the food was phenomenal. I swore that I would deal with the rude guy behind the counter for food this good. Went back a second time (First experience with \"No Comprende guy\") Food terrible. Chewy, fatty pastrami, under cooked burger.  I give multiple chances before I write a bad review. Many things can happen in restaurant business. Anyway, two more visits, two more experiences with poor service and fatty, chewy pastrami. Like I opened with though, the fries are great, and there is a good selection on the menu. Bottom line, go get the fries from Smashburger, along with a better burger. Let someone else tell you about the horrible service and zombie burger.",

I am really picky when it comes to pastrami because i like it thick and juicy just like the way they have it in New York City. I also had the Italian roast beef with onions and peppers and side of au jus. The beef was tender and flavorful which was accented by the onions and peppers. The au jus made it even better. I would give it more stars if the price was a little bit less. More than likely, I would go back to try something else.",

Seating is limited and drive through is available so whether you want to dine in, order out or whatever head to this place for a reasonably priced, awesome sandwich or burger. This particular location is pretty close to the airport too for the Vegas travelers out there. Sandwich huts like this one rock!",

    "text": "Okay so I happen to know the owners (Bryan on Trop & Brian on Decatur).  I have eaten there so many times it almost scary.  I take every person I know that visits from out of town to Sammy's.  I have even provided Diners, Drive-in's & Dives all of Sammy's information.  They would be foolish not to put this place on that show.  The food is delish & the servings massive. I am hoping that one day soon we will see another Sammy's location in North Vegas. I can honestly say that the Fries are the best I have ever had.  From the assortment of seasoned fries, to the Bacon cheese fries.  Heavenly.  And the great thing is they are never greasy. My personal favorite is either the Pastrami sandwich or the Pastrami fries.  Who would have thunk to put Pastrami on Fries?  My co-workers alway order the 502 Fries.  A pound of Fries topped with 2 different meats, chili, cheese etc...yes it is a heart attack waiting to happen. I have also tried the Big Assed Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was a bit too big for me but it was so so good.  My son loves the Chipotle Burger.  Everyone I have ever taken to Sammy's has loved the experience.  Both locations bring your food to the tables. As many drink refills as you can handle.  It is for sure...service with a smile.  And Bryan is not afraid to tell you to stop visiting him so much so you dont gain weight.  I do have to say though...Bryan...Put one in North Vegas puhlease!!!",

Bryan, one of the owners, was friendly, helpful, forthcoming with suggestions and truthful about answering questions. Waited 2 weeks before writing this review because I wanted to compare 2 supposedly good places in Torrance, CA ( Monks and Habits) to Sammy's. There is no comparison. Sammy has the much better burger, tastier, juicier, bigger, more meat...etc. The fries also are superior. Comparing to a local joint, Schoop's, Sammy's is still better, although Schoop's is better than the Calif places that I tried.",

However, it could have been cleaner.  At least wipe down the table in between customers.  We had the vanilla lemonade, cheeseburger, sweet potato fries and onion rings.  Everything was HUGE, but the burger could have been seasoned better in my opinion.  I was feeling super fat that day so I decided to get the gyro to go.  Now THAT was the piece de resistance!  Best gyro I ever had.  Seasoned extremely well, sauce was excellent.  The only drawback to sitting in the place was that the owner talked us to death!  My group and I couldn't even have a conversation without the owner jumping in, telling jokes/funny stories, etc... which is nice considering Vegas isn't known for it' customer service, but use common sense and lay off the Adderall for a couple weeks dude....",

The food is delish and the portions are humongous. From the double bacon cheeseburger, garlic fries, and to the milk shake (which was made with custard) all was yummy.  Sammy's did not disappoint.   Honestly, I cant wait to come back to Vegas and try out the rest of the selections they got there. So, if you have time to visit Sammy's please do... guaranteed you wont regret it!!",

I had to use a fork for meat hanging off the side of the Chipotle Burger, but eventually decided to dive in with my hands and get dirty.  It was a good kinda dirty :) .   Garlic Romano fries on the side. OMG they are good.  Everytime food came out for another table, we'd oooogle at the size of other burgers.  Absolutely huge.

    "text": "SAMMY'S = YUMMMMMMY. This place is off the hook. I'm not going to lie to you. This place definitely is 5 stars food-wise with no contest. Only reason why I brought this place down is that it took damn near longer than a restaurant to get my food. Why did it take that long you ask? Well for one thing there was ONE worker, don't ask me why there was only one, maybe everyone decided to call in sick just that one day I was there, boy what luck I had, or they seriously only have one worker (god I hope not they have more than one worker, this place is too good to have only one person working) well, this one worker was working everything, cashier, cook, drive-thru, but what did impress me most was that with only one worker he still managed to get our food very very very tasty. If this place wasn't so far from where my sister lives I'd try to come here more ofter and man do I wish we had a Sammy's joint in the Bay Area.  We ordered pastrami fries and some chipotle chicken wings. Man, did those two orders satisfy me and fill me up. The son got a plain cheese burger and that alone he said it was worth 4 stars. If the boy likes his burgers you can damn sure believe that this place is good. This place is known for its pastrami burgers but we decided not to get it this time around, but you better believe that next time we enter this joint we will be ordering a nice juicy pastrami burger.  There little shop is pretty small so you might wanna consider taking it to go if it's not to packed inside, but either or it's worth waiting for an open seat and eat your food freshly cooked. Price-wise it's pretty decent for the amount of food you get, seriously get a shizz load and I wish I'd took a picture of it to show the portions and how good it looked before I ate it, but I got to excited on how delicious it looked and I'm glad I didn't wait to take a picture because the food here is just as tasty as it looks. I feel sorry for other places that serve pastrami because there is no other place as good as this. Move over you fake imitations that serve pastrami *ahem* togos and subway.   If you want some good quality pastrami, it's worth coming here instead of stuffing yourself with some cheap pastrami at other sandwich places. I just wish my experience at this place was much better, because this place does deserve 5 stars. I want to come back here and get better service so I can bump up their rating because my first experience just seemed like I caught the place on a wrong day, but I do gotta be fair because the rating involves everything about a business not just the food.  Pastrami at Sammy's is second to none!",

So since i was on the strip I thought I would call and check to see how far they delivered.  I don't know who answered the line when I called but I asked what was the delivery range? He replied in such broken english that it could not be understood.  I asked again. He replied in the same way with some other words that could not be understood.  At that point I said never mind and hung up.  I then just got in the car with my friends and decided to drive over.  Mind you, this location is very small and back off Tropicana so you have to pay attention when looking for it.    We decided to go inside and see what the place is like before we order.  Mind you parking is limited.  It was a little after 8pm and they did not close until 10pm.  Walked up to the door and it was locked.  All lights were on but we saw no one inside.   We knocked a few times then saw one person who motioned that we had to go through the drive through.  There was no sign indicating dining room hours. Soooooo we piled back in the car and went around. (Thank goodness we were the only ones there at the time you will see why later)   We pull around to look at the menu and decide what we wanted. They have a big menu but we all wanted to try the pastrami.  We then pull up to the speaker to notice another sign that said pull up to the window to order. (Really?) We pull up and the guy ask us our order in a heavy accent which sounded very familiar to the person who answered the line when I called.  Note: check the video here on yelp of one of the guys they talk to.  I think this is the guy I am speaking of.  We wanted 5 pastramis with various different things on them and as we ordered he seemed to be in a hurry.  When asked to repeat the order he repeated it incorrectly, so we went over it again.  He said he had it but his english was poor at best and made it difficult for him to communicate what we ordered back to us so we were sure he got what we wanted.  After about 5 mins of trying to be sure he understood what we wanted we canceled one pastrami out of frustration. (I am glad we went to the window to order as it never would have worked through the speaker)  So we waited 20 minutes for it to be complete. Turns out he was the only person there.  You would think that with all the write ups about this place they would have more people working there at prime time.  So when we finally got the food we checked it and he did get the fries incorrect but we decided not to wait and just go on.  By this time there were 3 other cars behind us and I decided to pray for them and the time they had been waiting and would have to wait!!  The pastrami was actually good(the meat was tender with good flavor and bread was soft and good) as were the fries but the frustration of trying to get inside, ordering, and wait made it a less than great experience.  Note: they use a 3rd party service to deliver. They do not deliver themselves and there is a service charge.  Lastly, they ran out of mayo!!!! How do you do that at a burger joint??!!   I would only go back around lunch time when I could go inside.",

    "text": "Okay so about 3 months ago i see this place on The Travel Channel, and knowing i come to Vegas maybe twice a year, i make a note to book mark it. Fast forward to this week and here i am in Vegas with my wife and 6 year old son, and of course when its dinner time....i suggest my book marked Sammys. It was 6 p.m. on a Tuesday.  We drive here and first off, its aittle shack and the inside is kinda....Um.....dumpy....., the tables are wobbly, the plastic table covers were kinda nasty and now im feeling hesistant and wonder if we should leave.  We stay and i ask the cashier if the XXL $15 pastrami sandwich is big enough to share, he said yes so we order it, a large garlic fries to share, a bacon cheeseburger for my son and a large drink..came to $35,   Wait a second.....now that i think about it....the XXL was $15, so are you telling me a bacon cheeseburger, large garlic fries and large drink was $20? I wonder if i was over charged...HMmmm...oh well whatever.  Anyway back to review:  We get our fries about 10 mins before everything else, even the drink. They were plentiful and tasted pretty good, nothing mind blowing, and maybe could have used alittle more garlic. I mean they are GARLIC fries.  My sons bacon cheeseburger was good and was decent thickness.   The $15 XXL pastrami sandwich tasted  good with little fat, but my problem is for a XXL $15 sandwich, that bad boy should be over flowing with pastrami, it was ok size wise but i expected bigger, id hate to see the regular sized sandwich. After it was done, i asked for extra pickles....when i got the sandwich there were 4 pickles in a tiny cup you would normally put ketchup in and none on the sandwich. Do they normally come with the sandwich? Cause asking for extra on a $15 sandwich, i expected alot of them but no major biggie.  Now heres my biggest gripe. The cashier was a super nice black guy and he was doing EVERYTHING by himself. I felt bad asking for extra napkins, and then asking for mustard, and then asking for an extra plate cause i was taking him from doing 5 other jobs all at once.   He was answering phones, making food, taking orders and handling money WITHOUT gloves. I personally think handling money, answering phones and then going to make my food without washing or using gloves is fu*king disgusting. Do you realize how dirty cash and phones are? Im in Los Angeles and that shit is taken so seriously. Theres a awesome burger joint 2 blocks from my home that i go to all the time, and about 3 months ago i went in and the same shit was going on, i walked out vowing to never return, fast forward 90 days ago and they were closed for 30 days due to \"health reasons\", i dont know if thats why, but i hope so....thats nasty as hell. As we walked in Sammys, my wife says \"look....hes not wearing gloves\". Why risk our health and eat there anyway? I dont know...hunger, i guess.  Anyway....the food was decent, the prices were a tad high and the appearance and health risks were horrible. Will i be back....sadly, no.  So im giving it 3 stars and thats generous because the cashier was really nice and the pastrami itself was pretty damn good.  For a place that brags about being on television, please hire another guy and buy a box of friggin latex gloves for the cook.",

I would of had my money refunded. My husband  & I are from Los Angeles, we recently moved to Henderson and have been searching for a pastrami sandwich. We thought this was going to be our lucky night....wrong!  Sammy's claim to be like LA pastrami what joke, they fry the meat on the same grill with hamburger grease or whatever type of meat. Our order came out to $25.40 with one medium sandwich, garlic fries, and medium drink.   The one star is for the garlic fries which were decent even if they were cold.   My advise is Be afraid, be very afraid of Sammy's LA Pastrami.",

Keep in mind, their main item is pastrami so just about anything you order has that in it. There are other items without it but having only gone there twice, I got at least 98 more to go! Yay, more reasons to go!  I gave them 4 stars because their items are a bit pricey, but you do have the big portions factor. Their fries alone is a meal in itself so when you do order it, make sure you have people with you. That's why by the time I ordered my pastrami burger, fries and a drink, it came out to about 15 bucks. Of course I can go without the fries next time but that is still about 10 bucks for the burger and drink. Hay, I didnt say to eat there every day unless you wanna have an early death. All in moderation!  Service is very friendly, the location has a mom and pop feel to  it, and they are open late hours. So if you wanna satisfy that hunger and then some, you have plenty of choices here.",

Fat Burger was just right out front my Hotel but when I looked on the internet I found Sammy's and I told myself oh they're going to have much better chili cheese fries then Fatburgers although I've never tried Fatburgers Chili Chese Fries but if I remember right they use steak fries and I usually don't care for those big giant fries so I go to Sammy's there's no intercom to make your order so I wait, there's a car in front of me and then I decided you know what let me call them and place my order I call and the lady says you know I can't take your order I'm too busy go on the internet. She's lucky I even stayed there Wish I would have left, then I go on the internet make the order finally pull up to window.  She asked me can I see your order on your phone so I give her my phone and she's like well where does it say you paid. Lady this is your website this is your your dealings you should know that this gives me a confirmation number and means that I paid I asked her for chili cheese fries and she asked me would you like cheese with that, well of course I would I said. I added can I also get onions she replies well that's extra. I say that's fine I'll pay extra I get my food take it back to my hotel room and there is no onions on my order so I'm like okay that's fine I'll eat the chili cheese fries and honestly it was the most horrible thing I've ever eaten,  that chili was I don't know really bad taste so I ended up dumping the whole thing. I ordered a medium  pastrami I asked her for light mustard and she didn't honor that request she just put the normal amount of mustard on there. I didn't even end up finishing the sandwich either cuz it wasn't really that great. I ordered a lemonade.  I love lemonade and the sign says  the best anywhere we have the best lemonade. Was not the best it was sour.  That was a $16 trip I wish I would have saved the gas and went to Fatburger and got my food. I would have been much happier.",

I walked in because their Drive thru was broken. Really it was taped up like a busted package from amazon. Should have been a clue. As I opened the door the smell hit me. I was too embarrassed to turn around and walk out so I ordered. As I sat there waiting fir my food. I noticed not one other person came in or drive thru. I knew why. I was trying my hardest To smile and not barf. The women called me up to pick up my food and pay...1 pastrami and 1 order regular fries $15!!! I was in shock and confused. I signed and ran out. The stink followed me to my car. I couldn't bring myself to eat the food. The first chance I got to turn into a shopping center with a trash Can I threw the food out and drove with the windows down all the way home.  Most disgusting experience I have ever had. Please do not go to this joint. You will be sickened and robbed. The police should be dispatched and that's no joke.",

You were able to chose either cheddar sauce or provolone I said sauce yet she gave me regular. They didn't have cups to make it a combo so I had to order a side of fries.  They only have one employee doing everything, which is not okay! It took 10 min for her to take my order, a big family came after me then left...should've left with them.  The area was dirty you can tell this place has not been updated in years. Now let's talk prices! Uhm $16 for a 7in sub and side of small garlic fries!!! Didn't even get any napkins or ketchup, maybe that was extra? Definitely not worth the price and wait.  Unless they renovate everything then maybe I'll come back.",

Paid $7.00 for medium garlic fries and .75 for the runniest ranch ever. The lady the took our order looked irritated at best.

I was already in route to the restaurant so I just went in anyways to see what the issue was... when I walked in there was a table of four who hadn't had any food yet. The lady came up to help me (after me waiting without being acknowledged and her passing by me several times) and I told her I was waiting on my order from grub hub all she said was \"you need to contact the company\" very rude and snarky... then she proceeded to tell me she was busy and I need to follow the time posted... I responded I have to wait 40 minutes for chicken tenders? She said yes she's busy and to contact the company... I completely understand her being busy but  I really don't appreciate her attitude she was very aggressive and rude... terrible customer service",

Today, I had called to place an order but was told to order online because they did not take phone orders. Since the online ordering took 30 minutes or so in the past, I wasn't in the waiting mood nor willing try it out so I drove to order in person. Unfortunately the door was locked 30 mins prior to the posted close time. So to the drive thru I placed my order but was told they could only take cash because their internet was down and couldn't take credit card.   If I was able to place an order I would add a food review in hopes the food didn't change from its glorious past.",

    "text": "Oh boy... where to start? This is a go-to place I have frequented for some time now. They are the epitome of, \"hit and miss\". Make no mistake, when they hit it, it's a home run; can't stop eating. When they miss, I throw away what's left of what I ordered. I'll give 2 examples (of many) to emphasize what I mean. The mini corn dogs: when they have the correct batter and such on hand they are delicious. When they don't? They try to concoct a different batter that makes the dogs un-bearable. Sandwiches are the same in my experience, total hit or miss. One night I was particularly fiending and ordered a meal with mozzarella sticks. Are you ready for it? Multiple of the mozzarella sticks were... EMPTY! Just a shell with no cheese at all. I've never experienced anything like that. It's like they have different cooks at different times and you never know what you're going to get.  I'm a big proponent for consistency when it comes to food. Although they can be really GOOD, the bad outweighs the good unfortunately. Typically, I don't rate a place based on one visit. At least 2 or 3 should show a good foundation.   I don't know if owners changed or whatever, but quality definitely isn't top priority. I so want to go there again, but I opt for somewhere else because I never know what I'm going to get.

Craving pastrami, I gladly took my happy ass to the East side of Vegas (a 30min trek for me). The place looks like a house, so you could easily miss it. I go in and there are 2 other people waiting. There weren't any other menus laying out. 1 of the patrons gave me his. I browsed it over and didn't see any hotdogs for my daughter so she settled for a cheeseburger. I already knew I wanted a pastrami burger. I also decided to get a pastrami sandwich too, w/the garlic . My grandmother ordered an LA pastrami w/cheese. The waitress was very friendly and advised me it would be a short wait. So I sat in the car for about 10mins.   I go to retrieve my food and the order is wrong. Like they misunderstood I wanted cheese on 1 order. Then I got 2 pastrami sandwiches instead of a pastrami burger. So my order needed to be corrected. The cashier was very apologetic and gave me a lemonade for the inconvenience. Which took another 10mins so I just nibbled the fries and half of 1 of my sandwiches. The sandwich was DELICIOUS!!! The fries weren't great. They were just ok. Once my granny got her cheese she said her food was good too. My pastrami burger was massive and tasted good, but it was just an overwhelming combo for me. I'd probably just stick to the pastrami by itself. I'd definitely come back again!",

The only way to eat this tender cured sliced beef is simple in my opinion. On a french roll with mustard, pickles,  and cheese. Easy.  My sandwich today was perfect. A satisfying half pound portion of thinly sliced steamed meat piled high on a soft roll with mustard and pickles. Just like I described above.  Excellent! The meat was sliced perfect to stay tender and not over cooked to make it chewy or tough.   LA Pastrami has a ton of other items they serve on the menu I must try. Burgers, fries, homemade ice cream and the list goes on and on. I did not expect such a list of offerings from this little run down pastrami hut.   There are a few ways to save some $$ when you come. They gave a text deals loyalty program and also a discount when you purchase through Yelp.   Enjoy!",

When we got there we told the lady we ordered online and gave her my name and she asked how did we order online? There's only one way from what i can see smh.. so we are sitting there for about 14 minutes ( we were trying to get SOMEONE'S attention while sitting there ) and this lady comes to the window with the food and we were asking her  what happened we ordered the food almost an hour ago... with a HUGE attitude she told us that the time we ordered is the time is she made the food ( i think that's what she was saying ) anyway then the original lady comes back to the window and we are asking her why the cook has such a horrible attitude??? and she says EVERYONE SAYS THAT that;s why she stays in the back like what??? you just got $27 from me for some GARBAGE food and a HORRIBLE attitude !! Dont waste your time or money !!!",

Things have indeed changed.    The steak fries did not resemble the ones of years past.  The meat portion indeed could not possibly be the weight that it claims any longer.  Also the fries were mushed under all the chili and the little shreddings of \"rib-eye\" were dark, burnt and sad looking.    The wings are now fried until burnt as well and the sauce is on the side now.  Completely ruining the aesthetic appeal of ordering \"different styles\" of wings.    The menu is now handed to you and the prices are just as high.  Quality is not up to par for the prices any longer.  Food yet not perfect as I was used to was still pretty darn good tasting though.  Hence, 3 stars.",

    "text": "I had tried Sammy's before and was disappointed but as it was my first time there, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering.     I decided to give it another try.   I have been looking for good Italian beef, I hoped without the soggy onions on it, it would be pretty good.   I ordered and stated several times that I did not want anything on the sandwich.   I also decided to try their buffalo wings.      When I got home, the sandwich was full of the soggy onions I specifically asked to keep off.     I did drive 3.5 miles and figured the wings would still be somewhat crisp.   I was wrong.  I called to complain and was told if I wanted to bring it back, they would remake it.    I wasn't going to drive another 7 miles for that.   The lady didn't even ask my name.     Very disappointed and will probably not return.  THIS IS THE RESPONSE i GOT FROM BRIAN A., i GUESS HE IS THE OWNER OF SAMMY'S.  THIS MESSAGE CAME THROUGH THE YELP SYSTEM.  Great attitude.   Doesn't deserve to be in business.  Hi Jim, Brian sent you a message on Yelp: Brian A.   Brian A. Owner Subject: RE: Message from Jim L. for Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers \"My advice check your order before you leave. That is what I would have done. Oh well. Welcome to the new America. Nobody cares so why should I? Sammy's Pastrami and Burgers\"",

I'll give the quantity and quality of the food 5 stars - we never leave feeling unsatisfied, always freshly cooked, and the portions are HUGE.   Unfortunately, because it's a small place on a busy street with so few workers/cooks, the service is usually very slow and sometimes forgetful, which is why I couldn't bring myself to give it 5 stars. We don't go here if we are in any rush or looking for a quick, short meal.   But it's actually a nice date spot for us, and it's best to go with our stomachs ready for lots of delicious fries, juicy meaty sandwiches, mile-high burgers, and probably my favorite place for shakes and floats!",

I hardly felt comfortable putting my elbows on the dirty white, vinyl table cloths.  However, I'm sure there are some key items on the menu that are uniquely good.

First, I would like to address the cook at the time was really unprofessional with handling our food , my wife witnessed the cook eating out of bin and also saw the cook suck on her finger then continued to handle the food!!! That's really fucking nasty, when we brought it to her attention she continued to deny the accusations. I would not recommend anybody eat at this establishment unless you are willing to get sick.. It was a good place to eat until today's incident.. We were willing to give this place a chance but we couldn't especially since the cook continued to deny her nasty food handling ways. The 2nd issue we had, was there customer service was horrible, people who ordered after we had ordered all received their orders first. On a positive note we did get refunded. Eat at your own risk!",

    "text": "PLEASE READ My husband saw the review for this place on the Travel Channel and we made it a point to stop in Las Vegas specifically to give this place a try on our way home to So. Cal. from Lake Powell.  HUGE mistake! My husband had the Pastrami Melt and before even finishing his last bite he had intense stomach cramps (approx. 4:30).  We spent the next two hours waiting for my poor husband who got serious food poisoning. He had not eaten anything since breakfast so we know with 100% certainty it was from the Pastrami Melt. I am not a fan of pastrami so thank goodness I didn't touch the pastrami.   Aside from the hubby getting sick he didn't feel the Pastrami Melt was any better than others he had eaten elsewhere. The chicken in my chicken sandwich was extremely thin, not even a full chicken breast half. The chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-a is ten times better and less expensive. They won't give you a glass of water (we don't drink soda) but will gladly sell you bottled water. Only good thing was the Garlic Romano Fries.   Overall the place was quite dirty (floors needed sweeping, tablecloths dirty and torn), very small and extremely hot inside. It's 113 degrees outside and they are too cheap to turn on the A/C??  Oh and no bathroom for customers.   Makes me really wonder about how or why restaurants are selected to be featured on shows such as The Travel Channel.  Extremely disappointing.",

Anyway, came here again before leaving Vegas and got a chicken cheese steak (or something to that effect) along with a small order of sweet potato fries.   I was supremely disappointed with both. The meat used for the chicken was the kind of dark, shitty, low-grade crap you'd get from a bag of precooked Tyson at the grocery store. Guys, really, this is not the kind of meat to use in an $8 sandwich. I'm not saying it's all got the be organic white breast meat, but when every single bite produces some weird cartilaginous chunk, I take issue. And the buns they use are way too rubbery. I felt like a dog chewing on an old tire with each bite.    You know what's great about sweet potato fries? If you cut them up right and give 'em a good crisp in the oven, they're fucking delicious.   How can this be easily ruined? Coat them with enough salt and seasonings to cure a rump roast from Paul Bunyan's blue ox, Babe. Have you ever eaten something so salty it was almost painful? This is that thing again.",

    "text": "Diane and I made a dining visit here for the first time, just before a departure by car to Southern California.  We fueled up ourselves at about 8:45 p.m., with an AOL perk $10 off $20 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificate in hand.  As it turned out we ordered over $40 worth of food for a medium Pastrami Dip with Cheese, Mozzarella Sticks, Cheddar Cheese Fries, Pastrami Fries, and a can of diet soda.  Even though a sign at the entrance to the dining room said that the restaurant would be open until 10:00 p.m., we were told that, although to go orders would still be accepted, the dining room was closing at 9:00 p.m.  As a result the fountain drink machine had already been turned off, and no prepared hot food like Fried Chicken was available.  We were also informed that no restroom exists on the premises.  However, the sole staffer cooked up great-tasting food while we briefly waited, and portions were huge.  I received about 3/4 lb.of pastrami between my large Pastrami Dip and large Pastrami Fries.  Pickle Chips were added to the Pastrami Fries per my request.  The Provolone Cheese on my Pastrami Dip was very well melted; the meat mostly lean; the hot au jus on point; and the roll holding everything together nice and soft.  The sandwich was large, juicy, and luscious, and I devoured all of it right there, in addition to every piece of pastrami in my Pastrami Fries.  A few fries were left behind, because I was already quite full and didn't want to nod off on the road.  Diane received 11 Mozzarella Sticks when 9 were expected, and more Fries covered with Cheddar Cheese than she could handle.  The fries were abundant, but the cheese was somewhat congealed, and only covered the top layer of fries.  Yet who's complaining?  We both had plenty to eat, and got our money's worth.  The place was clean and comfortable, and we left on our own accord at 9:15 p.m., satiated and ready for a 3-1/2-hour night drive.  Food was easily four star in portion size, freshness, and quality.  But there were just two many items unavailable when we entered the restaurant to merit higher than an overall three-star rating.   Next time I will show up earlier in the day, when everything should be running on all cylinders.  And I will arrive very hungry, just as I did on this occasion.",

    "text": "Had hopes higher than their sandwiches when I saw this joint. Unfortunately, it lives up to 3 stars despite its stardom on all of the foodie channels.  This place in a strip mall would make it legitimately a hole in the wall. However, it's a standalone restaurant with the fewest sitting options possible. I think four tables, tops. There was only one lady working there when I went, which made the entire dining experience last about 45 minutes longer than it needed to.  I had the chipotle burger which comes stacked with stuff like an egg and french fries. Wow. Good taste, too. The only thing that didn't really live up to the hype was the burger itself. Rubbery, firm, packed. Nothing like what you should expect from a place with these street credz.",

    "text": "Ok folks so after reading Yelp reviews about Sammy's L.A. Pastrami place I had to try it. Plus they were on Dirty dining. I got the steak burger, regular burger, sweet potato fries and nuclear fries. The place looks like a rundown closed building, but it isn't closed. One of the dining room windows is shattered and they propped up a piece of plywood in front of it. The drive through speaker box looks like it's been broken for years. When you drive up to the window there is s sign that tells you to honk. This way they know you are there. After a few minutes a lady came to the window and handed me an old menu that looks like it could be the original one. She was the only one there. Took my order and my money. I had to sit right there as there is no parking. She cooked all the food which took 15 minutes. The only other car that came their left. I got my food and left. When I opened my container there was a puddle of grease for the burger and just completely fatty \"Steak\" on it with bacon that I'm not so sure about. I took a bite and it tasted fine but I just couldn't get past how the place looks and the dirty dining. The fries looked like they had old jalapenos on it. I just can't do this place. It needs to be torn down. I bought a few coupons for this place but gonna throw them away. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PLACE! Sammy's time to get a new place and start over or just close up shop. Good Luck!!!",

If you're lookin' for somethin' greasy, and sinfully delicious... this is the place to go! You can't go wrong with any of them.  Reubens are my fave type of sandwich. This Reuben was delicious and fully packed with pastrami but it would've been better with more sauerkraut and sauce, but that's just my preference. I like it loaded.   Sweet potato fries were tasty, they were more flavorful than other places I've been to.  The large deluxe fries were huge! It could feed 2-4 people depending on your appetites.   Service was okay, but it wasn't that important on this visit since we went through drive thru.  2018 Yelp Challenge Review #7",

    "text": "I have mixed emotions about this place.  First things first, I paid $16 for a 7\" philly cheesesteak and a small bag of sweet potato fries.  I ordered through PostMates, and on their menu it says these fries come with a \"chipotle catsup sauce\" which was not given to me, and in the other photos of the fries on here I don't see any mention of it.  My guess is that this sauce is no longer on offer but why not update your menu so the PAYING consumer isn't expecting something that isn't coming?  The 3 stars are strictly for the philly cheesesteak alone.  It was well loaded with ingredients and not overly greasy.  The ingredients tasted had flavour to them and tasted fresh.  The bread it was served on was fluffy and paired well with the contents.  The sweet potato fries I received were flimsy, stale, and burnt on the corners.   They had very obviously been reheated; to be honest, it wouldn't shock me if they had been reheated a few times.  The flavour was still there, but not without having that microwaved fry after taste.  Like I mentioned, this order was placed with PostMates and the estimated arrival time changed a minimum of 5 times.  After reading these reviews, I think it is safe to say the time switch is at the fault of the company since they are rumoured to not have enough employees to complete tasks in a timely manner.  No wonder delivery was free.",

Where did she go?  We're standing there hungry (and freezing as the AC was set so low) for a good 5 minutes.

Their gyro fries are on another level.  Only downsides are the location and staffing. If you are even a half of a second late spotting this place you WILL miss it. You have one chance and one chance only to pull in to the tiny driveway.

About a month later I was on the strip and ate at Pinks and had their pastrami/polish dog! Loved it then i kept getting a craving for pastrami over and over for the next few weeks so I remembered the pastrami place i kept driving by!  So I me and my kid stopped by for dinner about 8 months ago its a small dive,reminds me this small dive in Trona Ca that I used to eat at all the time growing up,except this place is smaller and different type of food,but I was Hooked! BETTER PASTRAMI THAN PINKS!!  so far my son and I go about every 3 weeks and get a new Item and have not been dissapointed at all!!  So far Id have to say me and my kid think the PASTRAMI and BACON sandwich is our favorite!!!! Just went in today and,yes I broke down and got a Pastrami and Bacon sandwich!   So good with the Romano Fries!!!  So I definately recomend!  The owner made me and my son some Hawaian Ice so we could try it for free, and as hot as it is out today! That totally hit the spot!!  GO!!  GO NOW!!!",

Utilizing one of the local delivery services, we ordered the truffle fries, onion rings, bacon cheeseburger and pastrami sandwich. While the onion rings did not arrive at all (they were out), the other items did, and they were all terrible.  It looked like the bacon cheeseburger had been put together inside the takeaway box, mustard and lettuce all over the place, and so much water/grease/something in the bottom of the box that the bottom bun had turned to total mush.  Same with the pastrami sandwich; bread un-toasted, wet, and soggy. The truffle fries were overcooked and wilted.  While we've received good food from Sammy's in the past, this time was SO bad that it'll be our last. Terrible customer consideration in the construction of this 'food'.",

And that is the pastrami on the pastrami burger I had. It was so good, tasty, and yummy, that I have to forgive the other things which caused me to lower the rating. It even undid damage done by pastrami having little more fat than I like.   The burger itself was mediocre, but pastrami was sensational.   The garlic fries fairly good, wouldn't get them again.   It's a little on the spendy side, though pastrami makes up for that also!",

The 502 fries are awesome and there shakes are top notch. I go here every couple months to get my fix and it never disappoints. Once this place finds a larger location to better serve the hordes of people it can attract it would be even better.",

    "text": "I saw Sammy's featured on a Travel Channel best eats special so I looked them up online. I saw they had this east side location so I decided to give them a try Monday night May 1st about 8:30 pm.  First impressions when you pull into the place is it's very small, basically a shack and it's pretty dumpy looking. I initially pulled into the drive-thru and saw a bunch of signs saying to pull up to the window and ask for a menu. I pulled around and there was already an SUV in the drive thru window- engine off and lights off. I figured that was a sign of a long wait so I parked and went inside instead.  The interior of the restaurant is not going to win any style awards. It's small, cramped and very shabby. As others have mentioned in their reviews, the kitchen looks disorganized and a bit dirty.   The next thing I noticed that others have also mentioned is there was only 1 person working the place. A young lady who looked a bit overwhelmed running around trying to do 10 things at once.  While I was waiting to have my order taken, I checked out the menu. It's 4 pages of all kinds of stuff. Sandwiches, burgers, loaded types of fries, chicken, shakes, and smoothies. A bit bewildering.  After the girl on duty finished up a huge order for the group in the SUV at the drive thru (about a 15 minute wait), I got my order in. I chose a gyros sandwich and garlic fries. There was also a guy ahead of me who had obviously been waiting a while who finally got his stuff and left. After about another 10 minutes (about 25 minutes total wait) I had my food and left to eat.  The food: The gyros sandwich was adequate. Not great but OK. The meat was not fresh off the spit but pre sliced. It was a bit dry. The pita was fresh and slightly toasted and the other toppings- tomato, onions and tzatziki sauce were all good. They did however sprinkle on some herb mix that was a little too strong and seemed out of place on the sandwich. The garlic-parmesan fries were hot and crisp and quite tasty.  The main problems I had with Sammy's were the service and prices. The prices on most of the food items is pretty high IMO. My gyros and fries ran something around $13. There are no specials or combo meal deals I saw to save a few bucks. Everything is ala carte. Seems to me charging as much as they do they could definitely afford to put one or two more people on staff. Just look around and you'll see it's obvious they aren't putting any money into the upkeep of the place! I don't blame the poor girl working for the long wait. She actually did an amazing job all things considered.",

But the winner was the onion ring!!!!   Probably the best onion rings ever.   Fresh onion, light, flaky batter....heaven!  The burger was good.  But a little greasy.   The brioche bun was beautiful.   Fresh lettuce would have been better than shredded ice berg   All in all, this is a dive.  Set your expectations.    The staff is sweet and the food is real.

We also ordered the chili cheese fries. Small size was good enough for both of us and our daughter.  For a small place that seats 12 and has a drive through it is understandable to have just one cook/cashier but it will be awhile until you get your food. There was 6 of us in house and 1 in drive through. Wait was about 30-40mins for our food and we were in the middle that ordered.  Burgers got messy. I don't mind messy burgers, it happens... But they didn't have a restroom for customers to wash their hands after. They had a sanitizer dispenser but it was empty and we asked for napkins twice. (They literally gave us 2 napkins each time)  I'm not complaining at all about these statements I have just said, I'm just trying to give the future customers a heads up. Food was great and customer service was good. Just be prepared for those things that's all :)",

It took me 3 times to actually , 100% find out it's a dump with shitty customer service!  1st time.... the lady at counter has a horrible attitude, but I figured it was early, they just opened and she hadn't got her day started. I ordered the Original Pastrami dip. The cajun fries, and a large pomegranate lemonade. $20! Wow!!!! Not to mention, She was the only person in the building and it was around lunch time. She continued to take another order before even starting on mine... didn't give me a drink as I waited. It took between 45 minutes to an hour to get my food.... and still NO drink! When I asked, she acted as if I was a bother to her, told me \"1 minute\" while she took another order and started their food. After, now I know was a full hour, and 1/2 my sandwich gone, she gave me a $5 pomegranate lemonade, that was 75% filled with ice.  2nd time... not too bad of an experience, but for me and my wife... we ate 2 small pastrami sandwiches, shared a small garlic fry, and each had a large lemonade $37 WTF!!!  3rd time.... we thought we got smart, so we bought the yelp coupon \"$14 for $20 of food. Then, we went to Circle K and got 2 XL sodas for $.79 each.  When we got there the same lady with a shitty attitude said no outside drinks. She said... \"I sell drinks here\" I said, \"We're buying your food, and I don't want 2 Lemonade's for $10 this time\" she rolled her eye's, so my wife just put the drinks in the car. We ordered 2 small pastrami sandwiches and shared a garlic fry. Total was $28. We tried to use the coupon, but she said we had to print it out, and couldn't be redeemed by phone.   I'm tired of writing about this run down, sewage smelling, expensive dump!!! With horrible customer service!  There's no way it has an A grade certificate from the health district!!!

    "text": "I came with Tiger W. and his husband for some dinner. It's a no frills greasy spoon type burgers and more type place with a expansive menu. The owner and grill guy was the only one there during a rush, so while it's fast food type food, it may not necessarily be fast. Did not mind though when there is good company and conversation.   I was thinking of a link sandwich and the guy said that one was just okay. So I asked to be hooked up with the most popular thing, the LA Pastrami. I thought it was rather good...Nice flavor on the pastrami, good melty cheese and lots of mustard how I like it. It may be too much mustard for some that do not love the condiment though.  I'm from LA, but I don't really know what makes it LA style actually except I notice we do hoagies, melted cheese, mustard, pickles (sometimes jus) outside of delis. It reminds me of places like The Hat, Johnny Pastrami, Okie Dog, etc. that I grew up eating. I definitely will come back when I get a hankering and figure their Ruebens will probably be pretty damn tasty.   I just got the small one, but it's very filling. I would say if you get fries or something, get one to share for the table, unless you want to have major itis later trying to put away all that.   I tried a bite of Tigers gyro, which is surprisingly pretty fucking good. Not what I would expect from a non Mediterranean spot to have something that is better some Greek spots in town.   After it died down, we spent a lot of time talking with Brian who is cool as hell. The food as well as the conversation was worth just hanging around and having a slow dinner. Definitely when it comes to food coma sized comfort classics, this probably is on the short list of solid spots to get your itis on.",

If you are in the mood for hot, fresh, and greasy fast food this is your place! I love the garlic Romano fries, they spicy Cajun and the gyro fries!! If you order large fries at this place they seriously give you a monster portion.   When i come here I stick to the basics, fries, wings or pastrami. My boyfriend on the other hand is a little but more adventuress and always tries new things. I have never heard a complaint about his food.   The shop is very small and I never see it get extremely busy. I have had to wait a long time in the drive thru for my food but I do not mind, I prefer my food to be freshly cooked. The workers have always been extremely friendly and personable.",

Style Pastrami, Sweet Potato Fries, Onion Rings, Regular Fries, and The Reuben.  The Pastrami was rather salty.  Everything else was just \"A-OK\" and the price was average.  Drive-Thru: Sammy's L.A. offers walk-in and drive-thru services.  We waited a really long time for our food but looked like only one guy was working the cashier and grill.    Will I Return? Probably not.  I've had better tasting Pastrami and Reuben's for the same price.  I'll stick to those sites.",

    "text": "Whew, I think I finally recovered from eating here yesterday! Three of us split the Three Squared Fry and did not finish it. This thing is out of this world, even bigger than the last time three of us hit it. Mountains of fries, chili, bacon, cheese, 3 eggs and a whole lot of other stuff! At $16.99 it might be their most expensive item but the price is right if you're sharing.   Even better than the fries are the custard shakes, so so tasty! The small is a whopping $4.99 but you do get 20oz which is plenty. If there is any left over after filling your cup, Brian the owner will probably top you off for free. He is sort of a goofy dude and thinks pretty highly of his food, but he is doing something right as this place has survived longer than any other eatery in this little shack.   The wait takes a while so I wouldn't recommend using the drive through.  The inside is small and not exactly clean but the food would probably kill you before any of the dirt, and the two A/C units haphazardly stuck in the wall do keep the place nice and cool.",

We also tried their parm and garlic fries, which were crunchy and delicious, also had their Cajun fries, those were pretty good but I liked the others better.

The \"frozen custard\" shake was the reason I ordered it... no frozen custard  used, it was the discount tub of ice cream!

Little did I know that this hole in the wall joint will provide us with the best sandwiches and burgers in town! Brian perfected the art food to an exact science.  We ordered 502 fries- a pound of fries with chili, rib eye steak, pastrami, jalapenos, and grilled onions.   Pastrami burger MOUNTED with two handfuls of pastrami! you could barely see the bun.  I got the gyro and we also got a Chipotle burger. Brian served us our food and even gave us step by step directions on how to eat every meal.  ALL WAS AMAZING! By the time we were done eating all of what we had we could barely breathe. but we pushed to try a custard milkshake. I tried the mango milkshake, but if you're going to try a milkshake try one thats off the menu the BANANA OREO MILKSHAKE its amazing. It tastes just like pie but in liquid form. We also tried the pomegranate lemonade and the strawberry lemonade to go with our meal. We walked out being four satisfied customers, and definitely a proud regular.  The amount of food they offer is more than what you paid for and definitely worth every penny. The best part is they offer you great conversation and the best sense of humor for FREE. That something you really can't find in any five star restaurant. Call me stingy, but this is definitely a secret landmark I do not intend on sharing with people who do not understand the beauty of food.  no go forth and experience GREAT FOOD to PERFECTION!",

He confusingly looks at me, like it was an inconvenience. He states I have to purchase $30 worth of food to get deal which didn't say on coupon. We ended  spending $17 more than expected. When asked about food recommendation, counter person read menu items & provided no help. The music playing & odd fellow reminded us of a Quentin Tarantino movie. We relocated to seats outside. It took about 20 mins to get garlic remano fries, pastrami melt, pastrami burger & root beer float. All items were large & burger single patty. You would think odd fellow would tell us it was way too much food for us but instead he provided no insight or details. We did not even youch burger & had more than half of fries left. After eating, he oddly offered cab which we already called for. Overall, food was good & don't mind hole in wall experience just didn't appreciate service!!

Pastrami even though the Jew in me really wanted the Reuben, because it had spicy mustard and kraut on rye.  The L.A. Pastrami sandwich was good too, but not as good as a good pastrami on rye.  The provolone and the roll on this sandwich made it a little heavy and sometimes masked the flavor of all the good pastrami.  I'm a bit of a traditionalist having grown up with this type of food, and it is a big no no in kosher land to serve meat and cheese together.  Price wise though, this is a bargain compared to the other Pastrami sandwiches I have had in the area.  The M Resort was charging 10 bucks, and Capriotti's charges 7 dollars with hardly any meat in the sandwich.  This my friends was also 7 dollars for a \"regular\" size and it is huge and overstuffed with hot tasty pastrami, easily could be split by two people.  Next time I will try the Reuben.",

With that said, my friends family of 4 and my family of 3 ordered a lot of food!!  And believe me, you get A LOT of food here!!  My wife and I shared a pastrami sandwich and the pastrami was tender and flavorful.  One of the best pastrami sandwiches we have had.  We shared the 502 fries and that was delicious.  The chili had great flavor and wasn't too spicy and anything with rib eye steak on it is great.  We couldn't even put a dent in those fries the first time and were eating leftovers for a few days.  My daughter had the chicken fingers and those were cooked well.  They are not processed but fresh tenders that are hand battered.  The batter was crispy and the tenders inside were moist.  My friend got the Philly cheesesteak and his wife got the gyro and both said that the sandwiches were tasty and delicious.  Service was good too.  There was one guy behind the counter that was the register and the cook.  His name was Kevin and he was very friendly and very helpful in navigating the menu.  The ambiance of the restaurant needs some work.  It is a little run down hut with only a few tables inside, six or seven.  When on the street, it is hard to find since the building is so small.  The tables and chairs were old and wobbly.  This place is totally a \"college\" joint where local UNLV students can come and get a ton of great tasting food for a decent price.",

The drive thru worker never gave us our drinks while we were waiting for the food. Hamburgers were dried out, fries were hard. Husband liked his hot link dish.

It doesn't take long once setting foot inside this dump to realize that you are in the wrong restaurant and you should have kept driving.  Everywhere you look there is nothing but filth.  The walls are dirty, the floor is dirty, the customers are smelly and obese, but the biggest piece of filth is the owner himself.  He talks incessantly, and has an ego like he's 7 feet tall when he is really about 4'11.  All he does is brag about how awesome Sammy's is.  On top of this he is extremely rude to paying customers.    After paying about $8 more than the food should actually cost, you have to be lucky to get a seat at one of the three dirty tables.  Most likely you will be waiting about 25 minutes before your food is ready.  At this point you are probably starving and hoping the food is as good as the owner talks it up to be.  I'm sorry to say that you will be sorely disappointed.  I had a burger and some of the so called delicious fries.  I would rate the burger at or below that of your average fast food place.  The fries were over seasoned and flat out disgusting.  I hit the door running after choking down my food and have never looked back.  I've had several nightmares about this place since this incident and now whenever I meet someone named Sammy I automatically despise them.  Please avoid this place at all costs.",

We had quite a long wait, and just placing our order seemed to be a production for the very nice older lady manning the register. It was exceptional! The medium fries would have been more than enough for two. The burgers were just to die for, and my picky hubby LOVED the double Pastrami Burger. I don't think I would bother with the drive Thru for time reasons, but we are now fans.",

After spending a while reading reviews and tips by fellow Yelpers I was on my way for lunch. Service was friendly and fast. There was no wait to take my order and cook time was like any small fast food joint. Their pastrami burger is phenomenal! A mound of juicy pastrami with gooey cheese! The mustard gives a perfect kick and the pickles are there but not over powering at all. All of it on a sturdy toasted roll like bun. I had it with a fried egg 'cause I must have a death wish. Paired with their perfectly cooked spicy Cajun fries the flavors were a party for my taste buds! I definitely recommend this place. I know I'll be back to try their sinful looking specialty fries. I need to stop now, I'm getting too excited.",

Sammy's is that, it reminds so much of home and all the neighborhood haunts we would frequent growing up! LOVE IT!",

The owner (Ryan, who seemed to have the craziest caffeine high I ever seen) was working there and being new to this town I asked what the best, or most popular thing was on the menu.  He said everything on our menu is the best.  At first I was put off by this but quickly realized he was right!  We had a group of 8 (which I do not recommend coming with large groups being as that there is very limited seating) all had different items on the menu and we were all super impressed with the food.  Definitely not a health joint as everything is super greasy, but man was this the best Pastrami I've ever had!  I will definitely make this spot one of my regulars.    After eating most of our meal Ryan was extremely helpful letting us know what to expect from Vegas, etc.  He even made fun of our touristy mini-van that we happened to come in =).  Also*** There are tons of magazine reviews all over their wall about how good they are, but each one mentioned they had the best homemade lemonade in town (which I didn't try).  So I recommend you ordering that, as I will next time I drop in.",

    "text": "As someone who works in the food industry, I know for sure it's important to let your guest know if something costs extra. I ordered a corned beef sandwich, and the cashier/cook (who was rude) asked me if I wanted mustard, Provolone cheese and pickles on my sandwich. I said yes, thinking that it was all included (cause I've honestly never even heard of a place that charges extra for cheese on a sandwich) Luckily  my boyfriend had read other reviews on here saying that they trick you into paying extra for cheese, so I told the cashier I didn't want it. Not that I can't afford cheese.. I just think it's wrong to trick people into paying extra like that! If you go to subway or chipotle they let you know that avocado costs extra. If you go to a sit-down restaurant they will let you know if a substitution costs extra, or if they'll charge extra to split something. It's completely unethical for a restaurant to trick their guest into paying extra for anything. Period. Come on!  I would've given this place more stars if that was the only issue, but my sandwich was awful. The corned beef tasted old and completely UNSEASONED. Gross.",

I ordered a large pepsi and the guy with the twitching eye started by adding pepsi acted like he took a call and continued to add root Beer soda then gave me the soda and quickly Walked away to the back and beber came back. Trust me I have had burgers and sandwiches priced $7-$15 all over the country and this must be the worst. Do not come here. It is a a hole in the Wall with lousy Food and service. In vegas better off at fat burger. A hint to all. If you pay with plastic, they have sign that says we charge a fee due to a large number of disputed transactions. Wonder Why patrons are disputing charges?",

For the amount of money you pay for your food, them charging $1.00 to use your card is outrageous. I ordered 3 items and my total was $30.00. So charging extra to use a debit card seems unnecessary. The food was good, pastrami was a little salty and the sandwhich i ordered which was supposed to come with pastrami, cheese, mustard and pickles... Only had the pastrami on it which totally killed it for me. All in all it was a bareable trip but i won't ever go back.",

I had to wait 10 minutes just to get a to go plate. The lady that was working there was rude!!! Maybe she was upset she was the only one there, but still rude. It's summer time in Vegas and they had the AC off!!! Now this should be something they shouldn't have to think about. Make your customer feel comfortable for these prices. I paid 16 dollars for a burger and a drink, and the burger was not that big. So yes it had good food, but the employee was rude the place was super hot, and the front was small and a little dirty. So if you can deal with over prices, rudeness, and having to wait long period of times because only one person is working. This is your place, this is not the place I saw on TV. Not even close.",

However, I was a bit turned off by the overly-honest-and-intimidating server when we first walked up to the counter. He had noticed that I had a gift certificate on hand and he was not too fond of it. Well, don't participate on the discounted website if you don't wish people to use it then..*sigh!!!  I agree with some reviewers that the prices are quiet steep for burgers and fries...We spent about $26 for 1 pastrami burger, 1 regular pastrami sandwich, 1 bacon cheese fries and 2 drinks...but well... they loaded quiet lots of pastrami on them..so no complaint about that!!! Although.. it's weird... the food.. though it's huge-looking..didn't seem to last in our stomach long...we were hungry again in a couple hours!!!   We definitely plan to come back when we're in Vegas..but for those who are interested to try.. please make sure you're not super hungry when you get there.. though it's a fast-food.. the service is pretty slow.. they only have 1 cook and 1 server...and lots of customers.. not sure if it was due to an afternoon (lunch time though) visit...but it took about 20 minutes to get our food.. so that was quiet a wait.. but worth it!  yummy!",

Since I was just a passenger, I got dragged to a Chinatown restaurant but the pastrami gods were with me so we went here.  I had my taste buds ready for a Pastrami Melt but my sister wanted to try it so, I ended up getting a Chipotle Steak Sandwich. My bro-in-law got an Italian Sausage but I don't have a picture of it since he gets mad if you take pictures of his food.  The Chipotle Steak Sammie (steak with cheese, chipotle, Cajun spices and fried egg on top) was alright. It was cheesy. The spices they used kind of made the sandwich taste a bit strange. The egg made it tolerable.  I tried my sister's Pastrami Melt. You know, the one I was supposed to get? It was good and I'm not a big pastrami fan.  It wasn't super loaded with pastrami and the flavor was good.  The place has a drive through and limited indoor and outdoor seating.  It's not the neatest place to eat at but it's alright.  I don't know what it is but I felt sick to my stomach on the drive home.  It might've been the cheese on the sammie and melt.",

My French dip arrived but it wasn't a typical French dip or what I was hoping for/expecting. It was a pastrami dip and it was SPICY. with pregnancy heartburn it was a little harsh, but I give all the credit to my husband because he tried his hardest to satisfy my craving. Just beware when ordering a French dip here it is spicy and it is not a beef French dip.",

Thankfully, I had read the Yelp reviews, so I was armed with info on what to get. There was a lady there who proudly professed her status as a \"regular\" there, so her tips were also helpful. My order? A small pastrami sandwich ($7.79), regular fries ($2.29 and change), and a medium strawberry lemonade $3.39). They aren't jokin when they say this is a one man show making everything fresh to order. I waited like 20-30 minutes for my to go order. Was it worth it??? It was ok. Honestly, this was not the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had, but it hit the spot.",

    "text": "Over priced dump of a place, that's well worth it.  If I can give one gripe about this place is the location, location, location, this place is truly a dump of a place, the AC half works, the inside has no welcoming feel to it. Although the nice cashier was very friendly, this place truly needs to be relocated. This place has strip pricing but none of the fun ambiance that the strip provides. Their parking consists of 4 spaces, so if their taken you have to park near some sketchy apartments next to the grease trap. Now this place does Uber eats if you don't want to swing by yourself, unfortunately they are prioritize so you do have to wait a good 20 mins to get your food with a bad AC unit. The food itself is pricey for a burger joint, but it does all come in larger options so great for sharing. Their pastrami starts at $10-$18. I got a 10\" but could only do half, I got a large order of chili cheese fries and only did half as well. Both food items were very filling and great. If this place was a few blocks further up this could be Vegas best kept secret. Although I gave this place a 4 star rating due to its food portions and taste, I will say the run down little shack really lacks a great seating option to enjoy your meal, the price is only worth it if you plan on sharing, but this place is far from a date location or a family friendly diner. Definitely a place worth trying, but not sure I'd bring my friends or family out here to eat definitely not at night or in the summer at least This is the first review that I've had mixed feelings about though. I stand my ground on the 4 star rating though, as this food portion, taste, and money value deserves the score",

The fries could have been better, but I didn't really expect much considering. Why such a low review? Well, we went through the drive thru and even though there was only 1 other person in front of us it took over an hour. Honestly, I probably could say closer to 1.5 hours, but I fear no one would believe me because that is just insanity. If it wasn't for getting several people on board and figuring out their order prior to going there - as in if this was just for me- I would have surely left and gone ANYPLACE else. I just kept thinking, well, surely it will be soon. I can not imagine what the heck was taking so long? It's just outrageous.   Honestly, no matter how good the food is, I will never be back. I don't have the time to wait 1-2 hours for a sandwich. It should also be noted that I only ordered 3 sandwiches and 1 order of fries. Although all of that is regardless because the majority of the wait was before he even got to me. Also, when I asked for a receipt he looked at me like I was crazy and handed me a scratch piece of paper with nonsense written on it. The reason I asked for a receipt was because I thought he had over charged me slightly, but wanted to double check before saying anything. But clearly these people have no idea what's going on... so instead of saying anything I just decided that who cares, because I'm not returning.   I had to give 2 stars, because the food is actually pretty decent. If anyone else braves the wait, good luck to you, I say! Seriously what a headache!",

The burger meat tasted like unseasoned frozen store bought patties and the fries tasted like they were deep fried twice. The total was $43.33 for 3 people.

It's a small hole in the wall shop- that should be a give away that just like the size, the staff is small also.   But just to double up on the fact- did your food taste good despite the wait? It always does to me. So good, in fact, that once I roll up I have to roll up twice, three times, and sometimes even four times in a row. They serve good-food-realness here. And I'll be a patient patron for as long as it takes to appreciate a good meal.  Have a heart- a server, cook, cashier, and manager all at the same time should help conceptualize how hard of a job it is to run this place. And yet still they manage to find themselves among top TV channels and reviews. Keep grinding Sammys! I love your joint!",

They have a sign (about 4X6) on the counter that was turned around backwards and not visible. Again, the Hispanic woman was a very rude person and she was also the cook that day.  I gave this place 3 stars ONLY because of the food taste, otherwise it would have been a 1 star review.  NOTE: Sandwiches come with no side, no chips or fries, etc. They are highly priced, but they are fair sized, just too high of a price for them.

    "text": "So this place was featured on the Travel Channel's Food Paradise. Episode: Drive Thru Paradise... So let's start with the service...  Service was absolutely horrendous. Made an online order with fried mushrooms only to find out they didn't have any breading for anything. So I said let me look at a menu and I'll get back to you. So my buddy and I came up to place our orders. He places his. Then just as I'm about to place mine, she starts reading off both of our orders. Well I hadn't placed mine yet. I was gonna order a double pastrami burger and an order of gyro fries. She said I had already ordered a small fry... I said no I didn't. She said its too late cuz the girl in the back had already started the small fries. I don't see what the big deal was. Just add some more fries and turn it into a gyro fry. No big deal... Well I was furious. They finally got me what I ordered but I was still very dissatisfied cuz she kept insisting that I had ordered a small fry...  Anyway, let's get to the food. And why this place gets 4 stars... ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!! The burger was one of the best I've ever eaten. And the gyro fries were a delicacy. The food was so good that I ate it slowly and savored every bite.  Place is in a bad neighborhood though...",

    "text": "Prepare to Spend some Money. This place is pricey.  Went here last night on (8-25-16) and drove right past the place. Then when we circled back we rolled up to the drive through and there was a small sign with NO menu stating to order from the window. When we got to the window we literally waited about 10 minutes before someone acknowledged and gave us a menu. (No Apologies for the wait and I'm 33 weeks pregnant, it was dark and the place already looked a bit sketch so getting out of my car was a NO for me) as we looked at the menu we saw what we came for and that was the Pastrami Sandwich.   We ordered our meal: 3 Pastrami w/ cheese, 3 Garlic Fries and 2 drinks  The total came out to $80.27!!! Now I'm not one for being cheap and will definitely pay for a well cooked meal but $50 plus tax just for 3 Pastrami Sandwiches was extremely irritating and that's without the cheese that was upsaled.   Over $22 for 3 SMALL Garlic Fries was absolutely absurd. I could've went over to boiling crab and gotten a better meal and would have gladly paid my $80 billing knowing I would get my money's worth.   The service was Mediocre and the place did not look so nice from the outside looking in. I don't care if this place was on Food Network I wouldn't spend my money on it. Rant over.",

It was not bad, but it was not the amazing food I have had in the past. Here are some of the differences I noted: the place is more run down, only 1 person working, no customers at lunch time, burger meat was very low quality, tastes freezer burned and no truffle oil as listed on the garlic fries. I can see if you have never eaten here before that you would like it, but if you would have had had it years ago, you would understand where I coming from. Sad to see this happen to such an amazing place. I won't be back.",

I've had three different people so far and appreciated their service immensely. Pastrami burger is a no brained but the chipotle burger is a MUST for your second try! Fresh lemonades in different flavors, custard! This is my place right now I've been telling everyone. Okay, don't want my food to get cold.... but this is the first time having a burger i wasn't splitting (portion sizes great) another pastrami burger and first go with the garlic fries. Onion rings are good and greasy and regular fries are tasty also!! Enjoy!",

Don't let the griminess get to you, because it does appear run down and dirty.   I ordered the Philly Subsandwich and it was delicious!!! Hefty portions too! I actually couldn't finish my food, but damn, I'll reiterate. IT WAS DELICIOUS!  If you don't mind that LA, NY grimy feel of a restaurant, I suggest checking this place out.

Waited 2 minutes at the window for someone to even acknowledge that I was even there, then she was ready to take my order. Yet, I had no idea about the menu, so I had to ask for a menu. (Nothing is posted outside, maybe because the prices would scare people off!) So I order a large \"LA Pastrami\" and a medium garlic fries. I get my total.....$24!?!?! Oh wait, its because they charge you a $1 to use a credit card. (Because the food isn't expensive enough!!!) So after 15 minutes of waiting, I finally got my food. AVERAGE pastrami sandwich. SOGGY fries. No napkins in the bag.   MY FIRST and LAST time going to this restaurant. Save yourself the trip and go get a pastrami at Subway.",

The area IS slightly on the questionable side, I drove around the surrounding area.) but that doesn't deter me from seeking good food. The ambiance? Well, that also doesn't deter me.  That said, the L.A. pastrami I had, (reg.) was heavy on the pastrami. The only criticism is that it needed to be a bit more peppery. The roll it came on,  a little soggy, dropped my high expectation for this sandwich considering all the rave reviews. Maybe I'm being a little rough, maybe I'm just spoiled having had Better in Los Angeles.  But I want that taste here! Continuing...Plenty of mustard and could have used a few more pickles. Over all this sandwich, out of 10 napkins, this was a sixer.  I think if they use a better roll and pepper up the Pastrami and maybe offer some of those yellow peppers for heat, they might have something.",

Now usually the staff is fantastic but today it was horrible . Now the little Hispanic lady working the counter was a bit rude . I could barley understand her which didn't help. I had my girlfriend come up and assist in ordering as she's Hispanic as well in hopes the lady behind the counter would speak Spanish to her but no she didn't . Then when are food came we asked for ranch and the Hispanic lady made a big deal out of it and didn't really want to give us ranch all because we didn't order it with out meal . Luck the nice older lady who I belive runs the place gave us a ranch. And now another complaint the table on the left in the front needs to be replaced or fixed as its very wobble.  As I've said I usually have a great time here but today it just wasn't the Sammys I love . There also stingy on there ranch and napkins.  I love the black guy cook he's awesome has great personality and customer service .",

Good thing is that it's clean, although there was no towel paper to dry your hands.  Also, parking sucks!  There are a very few # of stalls.  Maybe drive-thru is the best thing to do here.  There were only 2 people working there, so if there's a rush going on, it may take a while for the food to come out.  I got the pastrami burger and the chili cheese fries with grilled onions to share with the boyfriend.  Super yummy.  You will not be disappointed!  I crave this place from time to time...looks like I need to visit Vegas more :)  I would have given this place 5 stars, but I gave it 4 solely b/c of the inconvenience of parking and the restroom situation.",

    "text": "OK, so I went based on the hype and the video online. I will talk about the customer service and the food.  First the food. I was alone and I ordered a pastrami sandwich and an order of onion rings.The pastrami was average, at best, and the onion rings were soggy. I won't mention another restaurant in my review here because I think that is rude, but there is a chain of Pastrami places in the LA area where I live and their Pastrami is far more flavorful. Sure, Sammy's gives you a lot of Pastrami. But it is a lot of very average pastrami. I could order two sandwiches at the LA chain, get more pastrami that tastes better and still pay less than Sammy's sandwich. And there is no excuse for soggy onion rings.  Now, the customer service. It was bad. First, it took 20 minutes to get a simple pastrami sandwich and onion rings. There weren't that many people in front of me, only a few. But 20 minutes for an order does not a fast food place make. While watching the cook, it seemed like she wasn't good at multi-tasking and working ahead, something important for a cook in a place like this. While ordering I was trying to get an idea on size, I asked how big the 10 inch sandwich is and she responded ten inches. Yes, I could figure that out. I thought maybe she could show me. I watched as someone else wanted to change her order and the lady said that because it was in the computer, there was no way to change the order without charging her again. The ipad ordering system was in charge and helping a customer wasn't. Not to mention, when you pay, it asks you if you want a printed receipt, but they don't have a printer. So your only option is an emailed receipt. This place takes their procedures as more important than helping a customer.  Someone I know in the LA area told me she was thinking of driving to Vegas just to try this place, based on the hype. I reported back to her that not only would I not drive to Vegas, I wouldn't even drive across town to get a marginal sandwich at an expensive price with poor customer service.",

    "text": "This is easily my favorite burger place. I don't mean my favorite burger place in Las Vegas either, I mean period.  I've been coming to Sammy's for years now and I have a number of items I circle around on. The Chipotle Burger is wonderful, the Steak Burger is mighty and it's worth combining the two and have yourself a Chipotle Steak burger as well. When I stray away from burger land I have to say that the Italian combo is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I love that thing.  The meal fries are all awesome and great to share at a table. Make sure you have at least four guys if you're hitting up a large.  Oh yes, finally... the shakes--the CUSTARD shakes. These things will kill you but it's totally worth it. DO NOT get a large. Seriously. Don't do it.  Before going to Sammy's, you need to remember what it is: it's a man food type place. The portions are large, there's a lot of greasiness and fat going on (oh yeah, and runny eggs on some of the burgers). It's also a pit. There's four tables, some of them are uneven and frankly, it adds to the charm of the place.  Tip from a long time patron: Don't go to Sammy's and order a regular burger and fries. Don't. It's not because either item is bad but because the menu is WAY more interesting than that.  Additional tip: If you're an obnoxious customer, do not expect that being obnoxious will get you anywhere at Sammy's. Bryan, the owner, does not care how much you badger, complain or threaten. You may even get mocked by him should you choose to take that approach. I almost hope for this sort of customer whenever I drop in because watching the mayhem that ensues tends to enhance the meal.  I love this place and I almost always eat here with \"the guys.\" There are no salads. There is no \"light\" menu. These are burgers, the way God intended.",

But if it had all of that, it wouldn't be an awesome hole in the wall place that you don't want to miss.  Though I passed it twice before finding it, if you didn't know this place was here, you would never see it.  But then, it would be your loss.  The prices are a little high, so it's not going to be a regular stop for me - however, the pastrami is amazing and the burger is awesome.    Being always in the search for the perfect burger in Las Vegas, this place is now towards the top of the list.  The garlic fries are as awesome as every body else talked about.  My only disappointment is that I didn't get a double pastrami burger.  Though the single is plenty large, I felt sad as I took my last bite of my burger.   I'm looking forward to trying the one closer to my side of town.  Just the thought of it now makes me want to go for lunch - but then again, I value my marriage and won't dear go without my wife!",

    "text": "This place gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the food was eatable and I did not get sick. That is about it. My experience here was one of the worst in Las Vegas. The pastrami is mediocre at best. It is extremely salty. I assume this is because it is fried in the same grease as the burgers and the mixture causes additional salt to be added. The garlic fries don't actually have any chopped garlic or the like. They are bathed in garlic salt. So disappointing. Further, the person working was extremely rude. I asked for some water -- you would think that after spending 17.00 on a burger and fries that they would let you have a cup of water. No, she wanted me to buy a bottle for 2.00. Her excuse was that they had no filter so they could not serve tap water. Overall, avoiding this place will save you disappointment and 20.00+ dollars per person. Lots of better places to eat.",

    "text": "After our recent visit to the Sammy's L.A. Pastrami on Decatur, we were told that we need to visit the one on Tropicana.  Of course, this didn't take any persuading for the Husband who had his dinner planned out before he saw me.  This location is a bit bigger with a few tables inside the walk up counter, tables outside, and of course, their drive through.  Two people worked here when we went - one working the back and the other working the front.  Sticking with what they know best - pastrami, the Husband went for the Pastrami Burger \"A 1/4 lb burger topped with Sammy's famous pastrami, mustard, pickle & provolone.\" ($7.59)  He was also convinced to add a fried egg on top as well (99 cents)!  Since having their pastrami sandwich only a week ago, this burger is big but not quite as big as the sandwich.  But then again, it's loaded with hamburger meat, pastrami, and now a fried egg.  So, it's a serious burger.  He was digging it and ate it all up himself!  I was sticking with their signature fries and again went for the Garlic Romano, this time a large for $4.99.  Their large size is HUGE compared to the medium at the other location. I have no idea why!  We easily finished the medium before, but we didn't stand a chance with the large here.  Yikes!  We also shared a large Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade ($3.99).  Originally I asked for a frozen lemonade, but the guy working the counter suggested the regular one would be better.  After we put in our order, we took a seat outside to enjoy the spring evening and our food soon arrived.  The counter guy also came by to ask how we liked the food and even gave us refills on the lemonade.  Sweet!  He was definitely a friendly one and he knew more about when the place was going to be featured on the Food Network too.  Of course, we didn't finish the fries but the Husband brought them home.  He said they tasted even better the next day after a few minutes in the toaster oven.  Lucky!   They also have gift certificates available at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for this location.",

My order was fresh and hot, it was so good, I kept burning my mouth because I couldn't stop eating it! Not a big fan of pastrami but man do they know how to make chili cheese fries. Nummy!

Although the flavor was similar to \"The Hat\" in Cali, the meat was very dry as if it spent too much time on the flattop. There was what seemed to be \"Crusties\" from the dirty flattop (no, it wasn't pepper) on the meat and bread. Sadly I threw the sandwich away after spending a small fortune on a large to feed my wife and I.  Again, similar flavor as a True LA Pastrami but the quality was very disappointing. After all the good comments I read about this sandwich, I was expecting high quality and received Subway quality pastrami. I did have an excellent shake though and this shake deserves the 2 stars I gave.",

    "text": "My husband and I tried this place tonight and weren't disappointed. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and patient as we perused the overwhelming menu. I chose the \"gyros fries\" pretty quickly and asked if the large was enough for 2 people. My husband stated he was starving so usually that means he will eat enough for  2 all on his own. I ordered the regular size and he finally decided on the philly cheese steak and ranch fries. We shared a large iced tea.  The place is small, but not uncomfortable. The food came out rather quickly. The iced tea was great and fresh. The portions were huge. The regular fries was definately enough to share. My husband was a little skeptical about that but then I pointed out he would have enough room for a custard shake. He was right on board with that.  The fries were a good mix of vegetables and meat. Everything was fresh and the tzatziki was to die for. My husband loved the ranch fries and said his philly was \"very tasty\". I realized there was no way we were going to finish the amount of food we ordered so I suggested we just pool our efforts and eat as much of the gyros fries as possible and take the rest home.  So to sum up, service is great, food is great, portions are huge. It does seem a bit pricey but not when you consider the amount of food given. As a matter of a fact if we would have just split one entree it would have been a pretty cheap dinner for 2.",

I see other people complaining about the fact that the manager talks to them a lot. But, I rather enjoyed having a food buff who likes to chat and keep his customers informed on new and existing product. The homemade tzatziki (for gyros) sauce was delicious. My wife has eaten several Reuben sandwiches from several places and she said this place had the best. Watching the robotic meat slicer was cool.  The Bad: I assume the manager makes bank, so it's a wonder as to why he would want such a small location in such a rough looking part of town. It looks about as small as a taco shack. There are only about 7-8 tables (4 inside, 4 outside). Also, there is no REAL parking lot, we had to park in the back lot of an abandoned building sitting next to it. Both buildings are neighbored by a very crummy looking apartment building with a buncha tweakers and wannabe thugs walking around. I wish the manager would open a NICE locale in Henderson, then we'd go constantly.  Note: I would've gave this place 5 stars if the atmosphere didn't look so rough.",

We stop by Sammy's for some late night grub and get there just in time as they were about to close. First thing that hit us was the huge menu, I mean they had EVERYTHING. We has seen the place featured on Travel channel so we put that on our list of places to visit and glad we did. I had the Pastrami Sandwich and my GF got the Philly. First, this place is a dive which in our mind is a good thing. One of the owners was running the front counter and what a real character, he was telling us stories, knew all the customers and was the live of the party. Funniest part is we order the Onion Rings which were amazing, but when my GF asked for tartar sauce .. OHH the look she got!!! He was like.. Ahhhh NO.. He gave us burger sauce instead and it was good.. We were given clear instructions on how to eat the Philly as it was sooo messy we ended up with a fork in the end anyway. I have eaten at Pats and Ginos in Philly and I can say that the Philly here was by far the best so far.   PROs: 1.) Fun place with great food  2.) Decent Prices 3.) Great Menu 4.) Reasonable priced given the decor and food.   CONs: 1.) Little dirty and can be a shady part of town  Final: We will be going back",

I liked it enough to purchase additional coupons for it, but I would only go once a month or once every 2 - 3 months.  I live on the West side of town and this is on the East side of town so it wasn't all that convenient..  I had gone the other day after picking up a friend from the airport and when I presented my coupon I was told that as of November 1st, he, the owner was no longer going to accept the coupons.  I said I had more coupons at home.  He said I should bring in what I had and start using them before Nov 1st.   I had 5 more coupons.    The next day I called him to verify the use of the coupons.  I also asked him, since he wasn't going to be accepting them anymore can I use more than 1 since there was going to be 4 of us going there the next day.  He said, \"one coupon per email per day\".  I said fine.    Next day rolls around and I bring in 3 friends, he said I wasn't going to be allowed to use them.   He said the rules state 1 coupon per month.  I said but you told me the other day, PLUS I called yesterday.  All he could do was repeat the rules of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> of one a month.  He said he loses money every time the coupons is used.  After he and I both were repeating each other in frustration, I finally got him to admit, \"well, I changed my mind\".  At that point, my friends who I had also just picked up from the airport started to chime in to tell the owner off.  I was quite embarrassed that this was happening in front of my out of town guests.  (After I had told them what a great place this was for pastrami).  At that point, we decided not to give him our patronage.  I will never be going back there again so his statement can hold True...he will lose money.  I would have been perfectly all right if he did not say to me to bring the rest of the coupons in or to tell me when I called that I wouldn't be able to use them.  NOT for him to tell me AFTER i get there.  How inconsiderate!",

    "text": "I ate at Sammy's on May 31, 2013. I'm going to make my review short and to the point.  First, the good.  I was greeted and made to feel welcomed as I entered the place.  As suggested to me, I ordered the Pastrami/hamburger and it was big, hot, and tasty.  The Cajun fries (medium) were enough for two.  The sandwich, fries, and medium drink was $16.00, (a little more than I thought it should be.)  The Bad: You will have to wait longer than necessary to get your order,  Parking needs to be addressed (very little), the tables were Dirty, you would actually have to see them to understand, one table leaned so bad it should have been thrown away. As people came in and saw the tables, they would look at one another and think out loud, \"What have we gotten ourselves into\"?  My sandwich had so much mustard that it squirted out when I took a bite and I had to wipe mustard off my fingers after every bite. (I'd sugguest, Lighten up on the mustard.)  The menu was enormous and very hard to read and confusing. (Luckily, there were a couple of pictures up of what looked good but they could replace the menu with pictures/with prices. The door to the place was old and would not stay shut and the room itself was maybe 8 feet wide and 10 to 12 feet long, with 4 tables in it.  I think the place is designed for orders to go, but be prepared to wait a good while for your order as it was the norm for more people waiting than being served.   The guy taking orders should have been a used car salesman, as he made you believe, you were in for an eating experience. (which in a way, it was)",
