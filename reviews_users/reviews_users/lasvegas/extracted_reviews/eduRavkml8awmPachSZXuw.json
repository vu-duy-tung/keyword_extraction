A couple friends and I usually get together and go for happy hour which is served in the bar or the patio areas. In the summertime it's extremely hot to sit on the patio, (which is expected because it's Las Vegas) but there are misters all over. In the winter they place tall heaters on the patio to keep you warm. In the inside bar area there are a few tables placed but it can get crowded in there.  Ive had just about everything on the happy hour menu and it's all GREAT food and drinks!! The prices can range from $3-$6 and up but are well worth it.   I've came for just regular lunch and dinner which could be pricey but i love it, so it doesn't matter!",

    "text": "I can only attest to their happy hour, as I have never eaten their sushi.   With respect to their drink specials, they have a nice variety of different spirits with moderate pricing. They have sake bomb kits which consist of the traditional small bottle of warm sake and a large bottle of Kirin or Kirin light. I take issue with them only offering Kirin as the complementing beer for the sake, but beggars can't be choosers. If you're on the southwest side of town, I recommend 808 sushi for sake bombs. ($6 for Whatever beer you prefer and the warm sake, whereas here it is $7.50 with only Kirin). Their sake sangria is tasty and refreshing. Their margarita is a margarita. (Tautological)   I like their food specials. I recommend either the flatbread or the chicken/shrimp lettuce wraps. Most of these food specials can certainly be shared.   The ambience is nice and if it isn't too hot, the patio is a nice place to relax. Overall I think one can enjoy their experience here either after a long day after work or as a fancy way of pre-gaming. Disfrute!",

    "text": "People, back home Kona Grill was at least a weekly stop since it was located inside a mall (Scottsdale Fashion Square).  So I was eager to go back and find some of my favorite menu items.    Met some friends for Happy Hour then had dinner.  Started with our all time favorite Sake Bombers.  Our friends had never had one so we were obliged to show 'em how its done.    The buzz kill was the table next to us full of a bunch bored out of their mind people.  They kept staring at us like we were crazy.  Sorry, but no excuses for having fun-especially when I get a night out with friends-which doesn't happen very often.   Anyway, we ordered up a Crab Special Roll, California Roll and the Avocado Egg Rolls-all my favs-you can't go wrong, that's just how I \"roll\".  We sat indoors and an outdoor patio was available as well.  Happy hour prices are great, appetizers are half off.  Great friendly service and our waitress even recommended a great waiter named Chris and he was awesome too.    My only disappointment was that they were not serving the Mahi tacos for dinner! Say what?  That's like the only reason I came here-boo-hoo.  They must have changed that because it never use to be the case. Being a total creature of habit, I mourned my tacos and then was forced to try something else.  The pasta with shrimp was fabulous, so I was not disappointed.    It was quiet in the dining room not too many people on a Wednesday night. The Happy Hour is worth it with all appetizers being half off and the music was solid, I must have said, \"They're playing my song!\" like 10 times.  So I totally enjoyed the vibe and you could still hear the music where we were sitting for dinner.  I'll come back.",

Our server was Hunter who was great and seemed to want us to party because it was the opening week. Our drinks came out after a little bit of a wait, but we were assured by Hunter that the restaurant was still working out some kinks because it was new with all new staff. Management came by and checked on us which is always nice. We love this place and will continue to come back.",

Maybe 15 mins later server finally came, forgot her name but anyways she asked for ids and said she'll be back to take order. She didn't give us a menu. So we waited for her to come back and then about another 15-20 mins passed and she didn't come around. The place wasn't busy for her to take so long. I'm a server myself and this would be unacceptable , it's all about customer  service wether ur having a bad day or not u should give ur 100% to each guest and give them a great experience for them to come back, right? So I suppose u don't want regulars back. I finally got up and left, didn't find a manager but told the other servers about the horrible service the patio had hopefully bring some attention to it and fix it. Prob won't be back to this location, strip location has amazing service.",

We got there a couple minutes before happy hour. My friend ordered a drink but I opted to wait the couple minutes for happy hour to start. When I told the server this, I felt some attitude. I brushed it off and orders my drink once happy hour started.   We were there for a couple of hours. The server would only come over to the table when we started to look for her. When she would come over to the table and we would ask for more water she would take over ten minutes to bring it to us. Not to mention the sour look she had on her face the entire time.   I come to Kona often. Most of the time I go it is busy so the service takes longer. The other day when I was there there was a sufficient amount of staff there for all the customers, so I see no excuse for the slow service. I was very disappointed with the service, and felt ignored and unwanted there. I was there to have a good time with a friend I haven't seen for a while and felt like we were constantly worried about how the server would act and the look she has on her face when she came over to the table. I love this place, but at the moment I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.",

Just recently we went to Kona for happy hour and although the bar area was crowded (they only offer the happy hour menu on their patio, in the bar area, and at the sushi bar) we were able to find stools right at the main bar. There was actually very ample counterspace (something you may or may not get in certain restaurants when ordering food at the bar) and service was very good.  We ordered items off the happy hour menu: -chardonnay -spicy tuna roll -bbq chicken flatbread -chicken lettuce cups -steak wrap  My favorites were the flatbread and lettuce cups, although everything tasted very good. The best part was the bill...$28! You really can't beat that.",

It was $6.50 for an entree, 2 sides, and a drink. Good price but mac and cheese was terrible. The sauce almost tasted like a bland garlic alfredo that had no resemblance of cheese whatsoever. We got calamari which was almost inedible. The spicy aioli was ok but the calamari was underdone and the batter had no flavor. The batter had an odd texture, maybe just needed to be cooked s little longer, but we left over half of the order in the plate. We also got the smoked gouda fondue. It did not resemble a fondue at all! It was clumpy and cold. The little candle would've never gotten it to a fondue consistency at all.  Taco trio was just not good and the Las Vegas roll was lacking in flavor. All in all, I most likely won't come back. Ambiance was nice, food was pretty terrible.",

The best part is that after splitting the total tab with my group i usually end up spending less than 20 bucks for my part. There is always a great crowd and great people watching if your on the patio,.",

My husband's second order of beer never came. I had to get up and get my own napkin from the bar cuz she never came with it.  A lady on a near by table ended up leaving cuz her server never came to take her order and kept saying I will be right with you. The selection wasnt the same anymore although it still a good deal. We ate our order got up and went to Osaka's late night happy hour still.",

What makes Kona Grill is the bar and patio with big screens inside and sunshine (or heaters if necessary) outside. A really nice place to drink in the afternoon. Pun intended.

Food is spectacular! I really enjoyed the macadamia shrimp roll the most. The Tuna tower is quite filling as small as it looks.  I didn't give them 5 stars because I think the food was overpriced by $5.00. The rolls had about 5 to 6 slices which to me by most other sushi spots would be considered a half roll. The pork tenderloin dish had about 6 or 7 slices of  pork tenderloin . A huge helping of mashed potatoes and sprinkle of bak Choy and shoe string potatoes. It was more potatoes than meat still everything on the plate was yummy! I didn't care too much for the sweet and spicy sauce on the yamada roll it overpowered everything else in the roll and it tasted like I was eating a lumpia. Overall the food, service and establishment is awesome. I don't think I'll be back though as the pricing isn't right enough to frequent.",

Ordered two nigiri, the smoked salmon was excellent but the albacore was so vinegared up that it even disgusted me.. and I love vinegar.  Informed our server, Justen, and he said he would inform them of this problem.  Then, entrees arrived.. hubby's Grilled Ribeye Sandwich worked for him, but my Seared Scallops & Bacon with Citrus Aioli was beyond boring.  While I didn't expect much flavor from the scallops, there was absolutely none from the aioli, and barely any even from the bacon.  It was ridiculously tiny, four small scallops that were butterflied and then topped.. less food than any one nigiri.  I added a bit of lime juice from the plate decor, and that helped a teensy bit.. but not enough.  In the meantime, our server has disappeared on us.. we haven't seen diddly since our entrees arrived and I mentioned the vinegar overdose.  Neither of us had any soda left in our glasses, but nothing we could do about it.    We finally flagged Justen down and requested our check, at which point he offered us soda refills.  Really?  There was no attempt to offer a replacement on the failed nigiri, there was no service while we were dining.. hope he enjoyed the tiny tip, as I deducted the nigiri from that portion of the tab.  Will we return?  Nope.  One good nigiri and one decent sandwich doesn't make up for boring food and pathetic service.",

Came here with my Yelp check-in ready to go because you get a free sushi roll or appetizer ( with a purchase of an entree)  I ordered the Voodoo sushi ( for free with check-in) it was okay. Needed more sauce, I could barely taste it but hey, it was free so I won't complain too much. For my entree I ordered the  Cajun Salmon pasta. Wow... BLAND!! No seasoning on the pasta what-so-ever. The salmon was pretty good but the pasta was boring. Not worth my money.  Everyone else in my group ordered the macadamia crusted chicken and they all enjoyed that.  My boyfriend ordered the fondue as an appetizer which was pretty good!  Don't order the Pasta, skip that.  The service was great and he decor was beautiful.

    "text": "Kona Grill is a modern Asian fusion restaurant crossed with the franchise feel of a Cheesecake Factory. The menu is divided between the typical starters, salads, sandwiches, and entrees, and the sushi menu on the flip side. Personally, with the variety of sushi choices in Vegas, I would never order off the sushi menu, but the prices are actually quite reasonable.   For starters, the smoked gouda fondue is something nice and fun to share. For the entrees, they feature several island-inspired dishes with favorites marked by a triangle. I decided to try the macadamia nut chicken since I'm a fan of crusted chicken dishes. While I enjoyed the chicken itself, I was disappointed by the lack of any macadamia nut flavor. I would say the majority of the crust was made of panko. I did enjoy the accompanying mashed potatoes, broccoli, shoyu cream, and pineapple-papaya marmalade. Although, I do wish the chicken was topped more with the marmalade than the cream. If you're in the mood for seafood, the miso-sak sea bass was really good. The sea bass had big flakes and you get a pretty large portion.   While the food was on the average side for me, I will say the service was excellent and Kona Grill is a great choice if you're looking to dine with a large group. With the reasonable prices, I may have to come back to check out their happy hour, which apparently is all day on Sundays. The staff was on point and they were very accommodating to our large party and were able to split individual checks.",

I had their calamari for the first time last week, and it was excellent. However; every time I come to this restaurant, the service gets worse and worse. When I first walked in, I asked the hostess if the upstairs lounge was open again. All she did was point to the sign, which was facing the other way, into the restaurant, so I couldn't even read it, yet she made me feel dumb about it. Anyway, we decided to sit outside, and we were seated at a dirty table. And we watched the hosts seat dirty tables repeatedly throughout our lunch. It was absurd.   Our server was prompt in cleaning our high top for us and taking our first order of drinks and appetizers, but then we barely saw her after that. She checked in a couple of times, and she almost seemed annoyed when we wanted to order more sliders, and we waited far too long to close out our check. However; when it was time for us to leave a tip, she obviously cared about that a lot, and was back immediately to get it. She grabbed the check, tip, and we didn't even get to keep our receipt (and we only tipped 10%). We'll be returning only because the food is so good, and I recommend sitting inside instead of outside, particularly if it's busy, because the people inside seemed to get a lot more attention from the servers. It wasn't just us, we saw many people frustrated with the service outside. When we were getting seated, someone actually stopped the host as she was seating us to say that they were looking for their server.",

Not only were they not ready for us and I had made the reservation at least a week in advance, but they had to move a family to accommodate our group. While Tina was new and very sweet, they should have gotten people to help.  Instead they gave her more tables and the people running the food were rather short and a little rude. It took really long to get our sushi and of course we didn't get some plates so just canceled the order. While I like sitting in the bar here, I will never book a family event here again!

Can't help but notice the price hike on their happy hour items, but still a good value. The atmosphere upgrade looks pretty slick!  My go-to bevvy here is the frozen strawberry mango margarita with a sugar rim...Just 2 of them will have you on lean, as they don't skimp on the tequila. I love that they have a reverse night happy hour too, so I can pick up all my favorites then too.  Love the avocado egg rolls, chicken satay and the cheeseburger sliders. The desserts are also really good...go for the key lime pie w/ that perfect macadamia crust!",

I tried their Pad Thai which was a little bit underwhelming. The flavors weren't quite there and the price point seemed a bit high. I will probably come back for the appetizer and maybe try a new entree.",

But ordering off the HH menu is the way to go.  $8 sake bomb with a 20oz beer and a small sake, or higher class sake for $8 is great for drinks.  Add a few sushi rolls or lettuce wraps and you're good to go.  They have plenty of TVs and nice staff who are happy to serve you.  HH runs 5-7pm and 9-close so it's great for the usual or late night crowd.  I would recommend Kona for a nice HH meal with an eclectic offering that isn't simply sushi but also offers sliders, calamari, and other typical HH meals.  But if you're looking for authentic sushi, then I'd go elsewhere.",

It was over cooked and bland. I was beyond confused. The fish had no sauce, no flavor and was over cooked.

The patio is first come first serve seating which was nice for us because we could pick wherever we wanted to sit. However, that meant that the wait staff were terribly overburdened and not as attentive as I think they may be in the indoor seating. The waiter was amazing and as helpful as he could be with the number of other tables that he had to serve. We ordered the dragon roll on happy hour special and it was one of the better dragon rolls I've had in Vegas so far. But not one of the best ever.  Additionally, we ordered the burger on special - Mauna Kea Burger - and it was phenomenally cooked. We devoured it in an instant. It comes with crispy thin fries which were very well seasoned but the portion of the fries was a little small.  I would absolutely recommend Kona Grill. It's close to us so I think this will definitely be one of our happy hour spots on a weeknight when it's cool in the Fall.",

As for sushi, I was not really impressed. We ordered the Las Vegas roll which was just OK; the spicy tuna, which was NOT even spicy & the tuna was a weird light pink color closer to salmon rather than the dark pink that I'm used to; the wave roll, which was pretty tasty; and the spider roll which was also just OK. I wish I had ordered a burger or something cuz I didn't really see what was so special about this place.

After a long wait, our waitress informed us she'd been \"cut\" for the night. Our replacement waiter was nice but obviously overwhelmed. Our drink was watered down, and our waiter showed no interest in rectifying the situation. Food for each member of our party arrived at different times, and my salad and flatbread arrived at the same time (a pet peeve, and a sign nobody's minding the store). The sushi was passable, but my Margherita pizza was blasphemous and awful. Empty plates sat on our table for 20-30 minutes and even after asking other servers to ask our server about the check, it took another 10 minutes to get it. The agonizingly slow service was clearly the result of poor management, as servers were over-tasked. A series of small annoyances (soy dishes, but no soy sauce; having to ask multiple times for silverware; long periods of inattentiveness) added up to a disappointing experience on what was supposed to be a special occasion. Poorly-trained staff, inept management, lack of attention to details and customer service, mediocre food and inflated prices are not something I will endure again.",

If you do eat here be sure to check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer or sushi roll!   We Ordered: -Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($11.25 free with the Yelp check-in though!) - I wasn't too impressed with this, the dip itself was a bit on the watery side.  I didn't even take the left overs home which is saying a lot because I always take home left over food if I can! -Classic Caesar ($5.75 for side size) - This also underwhelmed me too, the salad was underdressed and the dressing itself was a little bland. -Chicken Chili ($4 add on to entree) - The best dish from everything we ordered!  The corn bread was tasty and the chili was warm and filling.  I'm surprised with how much they gave us too for it being an add on side soup.  The mini cornbread muffins were delicious too the jalapenos in it gave it a nice kick. -Pulled Pork Sliders ($12.50) - This dish was good but just your basic pulled pork slider, what surprised me the most were the sweet potato fries usually I don't like them they were pretty good here the sauce that comes with the fries was to die for too.  -Basil Pesto Linguine ($16.75) - I only had a bite of this but from what I tasted it was okay, a little on the bland side.  The garlic bread that came with it was disappointing too.      To be honest, I really don't see myself coming back here...friendly staff and cool decor though.",

    "text": "We walked in on a Monday around 7pm . It was not that busy . Told the hostess a table for 4 . We were sat at a high top in the bar. The table was too small for a party of 4 so when I asked the hostess is there was a different table I was told that was all that was available . There were at least 4 or 5 booths / tables available . So we just sat down. We ordered drinks and two a appetizer and a sushi roll. The rest of our party arrived and we ordered more drinks . As we waited for our waitress for what seemed to be 20 mins I noticed table after table being sat in the dinning area . When Our apps arrived they  were delivered by what seemed to be the manager . We had no silverware or chopsticks . We had empty waters . We finished our apps before the waitress asked us about our entree orders . We ordered and I had to ask for silverware and chopsticks . Still no water refills . Our meals arrived and all I can say is nothing was good . My lettuce wraps were gross . The poke bowl my friend ordered was so Spicy that's all you could taste . We had to flag a bus boy down to take the plates off our table ( the table wasn't big enough for all our plates ) I decided to order dessert in hopes that it was good . We ordered the butter chocolate cake . It took about 15 mins and when we took one bite it was the most dry cake I have ever seen . I think they forgot to butter in the butter cake .  I took a bite and gave up on it . This was our first time at this place and we even signed up for your rewards program and we're highly disappointed . From the really bad service to the horrible seating and the nasty over priced food . We won't be back . Skip this place and go across the street to PF Chang's or even in the same parking lot to Cheesecake Factory or Grimaldi's !!! Wish I could give it 1/2 a star .",

    "text": "About a 3 1/2 stars.  Honestly, I've only been to Kona Grill for their Happy Hour.  Yes.  I'm such a cheapie!  I've not been overly interested in their regular menu because I dunno, for ok looking Pacific Rim cuisine it just looks OK to me.  Just seems a tad overpriced.  But I do understand it's Summerlin so the markup needs to be present!  Seems lots of folks like Kona Grill for Happy Hour!  I think it runs M-F from 3 PM to 7 PM, and also most nights from 10 PM to close.  Keep in mind though the weather, Happy Hour is only available at the bar or the outside patio!  If it's too hot or too cold you're in for a not so happy hour.  Also, bar and outside patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis...don't expect a host or hostess to seat you!  Don't wait, find an open table and sit your fat @$$ down!  It can get super busy.  Happy Hour at Kona Grill has a nice menu selection of food and drinks.  It will definitely keep you snackin' and and conversatin'!  Just go with a few friends and you will be kept occupied for a few hours.  Eat and be merry!  Work on your game!  Trust me...some of you 'mackers' need some practice on your form.  Really, \"Come here often?\" is a pickup line?  Oi.  I may not be the best lookin' guy out there but dammit if I'm anything, I'm overconfident (thanks wifey for putting up with me).  Go out there and project you deserve a hot gal on your arm!  Girl with fake boobs and botox lips says \"NO\", just move on!  There's like a dozen of em' at the bar.  Can't score if you don't play the game!  Start shootin'!  Anyway, back to Happy Hour.  There's a lot to try from their menu.  Some of our faves are:  -Sweet & Spicy Shrimp -Chicken Satay -Kona Calamari -Chicken & Shrimp Lettuce Wraps -Cheeseburger Sliders -BBQ Chicken Flatbread (kinda like a pizza) -Crab Crunch Roll -Atlantic Roll  Of course on Happy Hour, all this food is 1/2 price!  Stock up and feed your friends!  Most things will average to between $4-$6 each item.  Save some money!  The drinks are decent prices during Kona Grill's Happy Hour too.  You can get a Sam Adams for $4, margaritas and cosmos for $5 each, wine selection of the day for $5, or a Bud Light draft for $3.50.  There's a few other specials as well.  Not only can you get fed, but get drunk on the cheap as well!  Reason why my rating might seem a bit low?  Damn, sometimes the quality of the food at Happy Hour isn't the greatest.  It just ends up tasting OK.  Of course for the price you pay you won't get your taste buds knocked off, but I've been to better Happy Hour shindigs.  Hello...Yard House, anyone??  Sometimes the food at Kona Grill can be hit or miss.  Plus, I knocked off a 1/2 star because who the HELL wants to sit out in the patio area when it's like 105 degrees and you're sweating like a baboon?  The fact that the water misters weren't working properly that day ticked me off as well.  Kinda ruins the experience just a little bit.  Service was OK, slow but I can understand somewhat because just about every table in the patio area was full.  And orders were steadily going into the kitchen at a nice rate.  At least our server was nice, and tried their best to keep our water filled since it really was hot outside.    Will I be back?  Sure, but there are so many other places to get your Happy Hour on at!  Kona Grill won't be the top of my list every time but it is a contender.  I hear right down the way at The Cheesecake Factory they have a Happy Hour of their own as well.  I'm pretty sure so does the Gordon Biersch right next door!  So choices, they are a plenty.",

There were no salt and pepper shakers, except for the waitress to put pepper on with a peppermill, which makes me uncomfortable.  I like to have the option to do it myself, how often I want , without having someone on top of me, doing it.  I ordered a Margherita, and it came in a short thick men's glass, instead of a Margarita glass.  I am a woman, and it was too masculine for me, and ruined my Margherita experience.  My drink was watered down, and tasted like lime-aide.  Also, the music was too loud, and it was hard to have a conversation, and we went home with headaches. It seemed like the music was playing very loud inside, and we were hearing it loud outside.  I wouldn't be anxious to go there again, and will not recommend it to anyone else.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of Kona grill's dining concept and how consistent the franchise is in a the locations I have visited. I do have to say this time my experience was nothing to rave about. I will start out by complimenting the frozen margaritas which always deliver in taste and alcohol content for their very fair happy hour pricing of $5 dollars. I ordered the avocado egg rolls which are one of my favorite appetizers on their menu. The egg rolls wee not crispy as usual and the avocado tasted a bit on the stale side. The calamari was another fail as it was way ok salty and I was surprised at the fact that it came out of the kitchen within less than five minutes. Makes me wonder if I got a calamari order that was cancelled and sag on their kitchen until I ordered it. Also our waitress was not very friendly. I understand that servers are very overwhelmed during happy hour settings however the place was not busy to where she could have taken sometime to get to know us and be a bit more friendly. I am just going on previous experiences and how awesome their servers tend to be. I also ordered their flatbread pepperoni pizza which to me was very reminiscent of a \"lunchables\" pizza lunch. My humble suggestion to this establishment is to pay close attention to their food item consistency specially the staples that people love and come back for. I will be coming back and hope to see improvements.",

It took quite some time for the waiter to take our order, but he was working on at least 10 other tables, so we understood.  Appetizer- The yellow tail was a little bit more fishy than I like, but the ponzo sauce, cilantro, jalepeno, and crispy rice strips  made for an awesome array of textures! Meal- I ordered the pork tenderloins with mashed potatoes and bok choy. WOW! Simply the best I've ever had. Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. A job well done.  We also ordered the Strawberry Basil Lemonade with rum. WOW, DANGEROUS! SOOOOO GOOOOOD!",

I mean this place had only about 4 tables going at that time and a lot of idle servers - which really added to our annoyance. We called over another waitress, paid for our drinks and left.

You either have to sit at the bar or outside on the patio for the HH prices. Luckily, it was a nice sunny day so we sat outside.   The bf and I were craving sushi (although not the BEST place to come for sushi) -- their sushi was suffice. Ordered some salmon nigiri and spicy tuna roll. Also got the tuna nachos which was seared sliced ahi on fried wonton chips.. not what I expected but nonetheless delicious. Also, got a couple martinis and beers to wash it all down.  Service was overall mediocre.. Took us a while to even get a menu.   Overall, Kona Grill was enjoyable. Food was fine nothing spectacular. Just pretty cool they have HH on Sundays..",

    "text": "I came home to Las Vegas to spend time with family for the holidays. My mom and stepdad decided to take me here for dinner while I'm here. The two of them kept raving about how it's \"sooooo gooood\" and that there is \"nothing bad here at all!\" Naturally, I kept a clear mind and tasted everything they ordered to add to my Yelp review.  We came on a Tuesday evening around 8:30pm. It was aesthetically pleasing at night time. Dim lights, gentle colors, very nice decor, sophisticated. I'd say it's a pretty nice date place. The front area to the left was the bar which was separated from the normal dining area by glass. The noise level wasn't too distracting and you could just hear the music. But it wasn't obnoxious or anything like that. They played a lot of music that I used to listen in in the early '00s.   We ordered the Crab Special sushi roll as an appetizer. It wasn't very impressive. Maybe I've just had my fair share of sushi places, or maybe it was a bad night. But it was a so-so roll for me and I probably wouldn't choose to get it again. Then again, it was a simple crab roll, so maybe it's just me. As for entrees, my stepdad ordered a caesar salad with the macadamia nut chicken added in. He had upgraded to an entree size, and I must say that it was pretty big. They added in these cheese cracker like things that added a nice touch to the salad. My mom ordered the Pan-Asian Noodle dish because they had gotten it before and fell in love. It was a warm udon noodle with seasoned beef. I only tasted the noodle and it was really, really full of flavor. The presentation made the dish seem small, but don't let that deceive you! There's quite a bit there to fill you up. I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken entree. It had two large pieces of crispy chicken covered in their shoyu-cream sauce. The combination was delicious! Not too creamy and not too bland. The chicken was also very tender. There was also a side of string beans which were a little too salty for my liking. It was cooked with a lot of butter and garlic. Luckily, there was a side of garlic mashed potatoes to balance the flavor. The pineapple-papaya marmalade was really refreshing as well. If I had to score the dish itself on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 7. The serving size was also very generous, I ended up taking half of it home even after offering my parents some.   Although I missed her name, the waitress that served us was very kind. She made sure to check on us often and answered any questions that we had. She also provided more info on other dishes and gave recommendations. So based on her, I'd say the place had pretty good customer service.   So with two sushi rolls and three entrees, we spent a total of about $70. Not too bad. I wouldn't go all the time, but every once in a while would be nice.  Next time I should try to go with a few friend to check out the happy hour. The people there seemed to be having a lot of fun!",

    "text": "Places with enjoyable outdoor seating generally get a 1-star patio bump, and Kona Grill has some nice real estate for dining al fresco. Yes, as with most Las Vegas patios, it overlooks a parking lot, but there is a bit of greenery to shield your eyes. Plus, there is generally some nice auto eye candy in the parking lot.   My first Kona experience was at lunchtime with the parents. Beware of the iced tea. We were all on a flavored tea kick after sipping on some fruity treats at Create and Sammy's, so we swiftly ordered up some of the enticing flavors at Kona. Little did we know that their flavors were delivered in a four-dollar Republic of Tea bottle! We searched the menu and found no indication that this was the deal, or rather un-deal.  $4 and no refills? I suggest sticking to the regular brewed tea.   We all went with the perfect pairings lunch offerings. You pick two from a nice list of options for $8 and change. I chose a salad and the turkey chili. My husband went with some sushi. The salad was okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the over miso'd dressing. I love miso, but it was really overpowering. The turkey chili, however, was yummy. My only complaint is that I wanted more! The sushi looked a little sad. The imitation crab was leaking pink onto the plate. Never a good sign, but my husband seemed happy enough.  I wouldn't say Kona was a knockout experience for us, but there is that patio bump in effect, and the happy hour specials definitely demand a repeat visit.",

Service is slow slow slow as they get busy but it's expected but I've seen some restaurants handle the rush well so in my eyes extremely slow service is hard to overlook. Happy hour is from 3 to 7 and on Sunday it's all day so if you're looking to save some bucks, the food and drink choices are a great bang for your buck during these times. The food is nothing special but the environment is more of the stand out star. Next time I'll just be going for drinks",

    "text": "Welcome back Kona Grill!  We were regular fans for several years, mostly having the same complaint of loud/obnoxious music that even employees disliked.  But then Kona opened up on the Strip & voila!  Summerlin decided to have the same prices -- much higher, incl. on happy hour.  Well, not needing to pay for this transgression when just about every restaurant has a cheaper happy hour, we didn't return.  Then I found out that they were offering up all food & appetizers for five ($5) bucks from 2-7:00 daily.  In disbelief, our car catapulted out of the garage late yesterday & we were met with a wonderful, festive-type ambiance that radiated \"welcome.\"  The outdoor lights & seating arrangements (incl. high tops), as well as the interior also feeling like outdoors, had us lingering a while longer than usual.  Paul was our server & he exemplifies what service should look like, besides his intelligence & charm.  I mean, we'd return just to see Paul (only there weekends).  Our timing was right for the $1.00 margarita (served both ways) before 5:00, & the offerings were tremendous...  My partner had the 2 sliders, the size of regular burgers, & served w/really good fries.  I opted for Atlantic sushi w/salmon & the terrific chicken satays w/equally good slaw & a peanut sauce.  P.S. The margarita was also just right.  The music was low enough for conversation & we, overall, had a fine  time.  ** Note:  Their regular menu has wonderful choices in every category & prices are fair.  Even includes Jambalaya (who'd have thunk it?)",

The interior reminds me of a beach bar just with no beach. It's upscale swank interior makes Kona a great place for date nights or just to hang out and watch sports.  The long bar serves indoor and outdoor seating and seats like 30-40 sitting and 50 or more when packed. Outdoor is awesome so is indoor seating options.   The sushi bar extends from the kitchen into the main dining area. It's a great spot to hang out at and chat up the Sushi chefs while  impressing your date with your raw fish knowledge.   The staff are knowledgeable,  local and very friendly. The prices are on the higher side, but it's worth it.  The food, appy hour prices all day Saturdays , so ordered the Dragon Roll, Calamari (very lightly breaded), and a fish taco plate with Sam Adams draft ale. Great day.",

Never the case, the service has always been good but literally I dreaded going back. Only reason I did was due to a friends birthday.  Before this I tried their sushi rolls I forget the names of them and for good reason (nothing spectacular) you can get better rolls at any sushi bar and the bento box for my sons. The bento box was pretty week I must admit.  This time around I decided to try the sea bass, it was just okay. I can't recommend this for the money they charge and the presentation is pretty sad. All their food looks like it was made at home. That's the best way I can describe it. It's a great atmosphere and service is good I just hope they improve the recipes.",

I sat at the bar and ordered a Margarita and an appetizer. The Shrimp & Lobster for $16.00 was meh. I did not taste anything that felt like it was great when biting into it which was disappointing and the rice was just not fresh, but not the reason that I would write this review. I am leaving a review because I could not believe the lack of attention from management to approach the issue. I had to ask to be sat somewhere else because the bartender was having a discussion with a guest and the bartender did not feel it was appropriate to let the person he was having a conversation with that dropping the f-bomb in every sentence and talking about condoms and pussy was inappropriate. It was not a low voice that the guest was using, but like if he was at his house with his buds. I asked for the manager and he understood and agreed with me, but did not address the situation, at least not while I was still at the establishment. I wish I had gone to Pancho's where management is great, the employees are friendly and professional and the Margarita's are great.",

If you come in thinking this way then I think you're gonna enjoy your time here.  I came here for happy hour and they have a pretty good menu with a variety of food and drinks. Regular rolls are 4.50. Apps are around 8 and special rolls at 10 bucks. We sat in the rooftop bar so it gets pretty hot but it's covered and they have mist fans blasting in all corners.   I thought the service was pretty good. Happy hour is a busy time but our server was there for the basics. Getting you water, refilling your water, taking your order and getting your check. That's all I really need.   I had the potstickers which was really good!  Crispy with a hearty pork filling. The bama roll is good as well. I enjoyed it though there wasn't much fresh fish. The spicy tuna roll was the only thing I didn't like. There was no flavor, it wasn't spicy and the tuna tasted a little fishy.   Overall happy hour is great and I'll be back.",

The food was fine and our server was nice, but sadly the way our service was executed was unfortunate. Our reservation was at 815 and we sat and ordered our first round of drinks and waited till 9 for HH to order the rest of our food. Ordered exactly at 9. Our appetizers came and so did the pastas. My bf ordered a HH old fashioned which after 30 minutes had not arrived. We had to ask for it again and only received it after another 15 min. Almost 45 minutes for one drink and in my opinion should have been taken care of by management but it wasn't. Our waiter told us last call was going on at 945. Our sushi arrived at 10, an hour after we ordered. One of my guests asked for a drink to accompany her meal and was told no. During the dinner one of my friends told our server that there were 2 birthdays at the table. At the end of our meal our checks were brought to us right away. Not one person offered any dessert menus or coffee to the table. Being the only celebration we could have with all of our friends and family it would have been nice to at least have gotten something where we could sing happy birthday. It's not even about wanting a free dessert, it's more of the lack of consideration on the restaurants part. Overall a disappointing experience and sadly on what was supposed to be a celebration.",

There were four of us ordering: Pepperoni flatbread  Margherita flatbread  Pad Thai combination noodles  Kona Grill salad with the macadamia nut crusted chicken.  The pepperoni flatbread was extremely disappointing; essentially a greasy mess. If the server had been by the table more than once I probably would have sent it back. Margarita pizza was good; cracker thin crust tasty and a nice portion size. The pad thai combination noodles; good portion and very tasty. The Kona salad with the macadamia nut crusted chicken  was okay but there weren't any options for salad dressing. And as a side note, we hadn't returned the Cheesecake Factory buzzer yet and had it with us when we sat down at Kona Grill. About halfway through dinner, the Cheesecake Factory buzzer actually went off as apparently our table is ready down at Cheesecake.  Overall this remodeled location looks nice but there really wasn't a lot of value in the menu; especially if you're looking for higher protein type of meal.   Talking with the staff they mentioned that Sundays with half price appetizers and drinks all day is when this place gets busy.",

I didn't send it back, and it certainly was fine, but not exactly straight up.  The chicken satay is excellent. I stopped ordering chicken satay anywhere as it seemed to slump into a predictable, formulated chicken brick. The chicken used here for the satay was tasty, real, moist and looked like chicken, too. The peanut sauce and the hoisin sauce are great, and the bed of Russian-dressed slaw is refreshing (and a bit spicy).  The yellowtail sashimi we ordered was fresh, crisp and what I'd hoped for.   The Lobster Mac and Cheese delivers, if that's your thing. The Macadamia Nut Chicken is another winner - though you need to be OK with deep-fried.   Despite rumored good burgers here, the burger served to our party was meh. Overcooked (to my eyes), but that didn't stop our guy from diving into it. Yet, at the halfway point, he bailed. The pay-off, though, was he didn't want to bring the rest home.  The grilled halibut special is not very special. Sounds really good, but it was way overcooked and just not happening. Much better is the Sea Bass. Flavorful, moist, lovely. In fairness, our server had definitely steered us toward the Sea Bass while we were ordering. Wanting to mix it up, we ordered one of each. But, happily, our server swapped out the halibut for another Sea Bass.  You may want to ask for a taste of the wines, first. Someone ordered a pretty standard white that turned out not so great. Switched that for the good stuff, and all was right again.  Desserts -- well, the Brownie is outstanding. Served with vanilla ice cream, plus 'vanilla cream sauce' aka whip cream (we opted for no whip), and served over a swath of caramel, it's worth it. Also, we loved the Butter Cake. Served with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  Service was generally very good. Occasionally we had to look around for some help, but I think our guy was great. The place was pretty empty on a Monday night. We called for a ressie for 6:30pm, and were told they couldn't accommodate us at 6:30pm, but at 6:15pm. Once we got to Kona, we really didn't understand why it mattered given the seemingly sparse crowd.  Check-in with Yelp got us a nice treat, too.",

I've come through this location one other time and it was just okay, I was craving sushi so I ordered the Philadelphia roll, a couple spicy tuna rolls, the tomato bisque soup and to drink a raspberry lemonade. The order came out and instead of the Philadelphia roll they made me a California roll. I told the waitress that I didn't order this she said well I must've not heard you right so then she takes it back my husband finishes his food before mine is brought out so I eat some of the soup which could've been good if I wasn't constantly choking on the tomato peal that was left in the very chunky soup. Once my sushi finally got to the table, I was disappointed with the taste, I've had better super market sushi not even kidding! Oh can't forget the 2 yes 2 bees in my lemonade! They were at the bottom of the glass had to have been dead a while. They did warn us about bees outside and the whole time we were there we saw 0 bees!! Flying around us so idk. What I do know is that I'm not impressed with the food and service is a little lacking considering the restaurants in the area. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",

They also have sake bombs with a whole bottle of Kirin and hot sake for $7 that my boyfriend had.   We ordered:   Flatbread pizza: it was good. Lots of cheese and pepperoni!  Calamari: slightly rubbery and tough. But the spicy mayo complimented it well. Spinach and artichoke dip: literally leafs of spinach and chunks of artichoke. I didn't really that at all.  Spicy chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps: my favorite!! The chicken and shrimp were very savory and was perfectly spicy when you add that sauce.   Overall I would come back!

We couldn't find a seat in the air conditioned part of the bar so we went upstairs come to find out it's not air conditioned up there at all!!!!!! It was way too hot to even get to enjoy our food we came downstairs and had to sit outside I felt horrible that my friends mom was wiping off her dripping sweat the entire time! If your going to renovate PLEASE do it right it is HOT AS SHIT in Vegas in the summer how do you expect people to sit outside? Yes you have misters but they are way up high and they don't make a difference !!!!! Spend some money and get some outdoor air conditioning PLEASE!",

Luckily, my party was blessed with my presence because I ate at Kona Grill several times before since I used to have a cousin that worked at Kona Grill. I have eaten most of the items from the menu so I was their food expert there. I did recommend the calamari, lettuce wraps, miso sake sea bass, basil pesto linguini, and macadamia nut chicken.   The future hubby and I ordered the calamari and miso sake sea bass, which used to be my favorite. When we got our order, I was highly disappointed. It wasn't what I remember ever having. The calamari did not taste fresh, the miso-sake sea bass was tough, and the rice tasted old/stale. Fortunately, it seemed that everyone else other than myself and fiance were happy with their food so I didn't express my dissatisfaction.   The server rarely checked up on us, but he did split our checks so that was nice.",

Not gonna lie her service was the best service I have probably had in the longest time!

I went here with my friend who when we were dating loved the macadamia nut chicken, so we dropped in Saturday night around 730pm. They must have had a huge kids party because the place was packed with kids and parents, and had a buffet style set up in the middle of the room. It was ending, so the noise level went from loud to quiet in about 20 minutes.  Ordered the mac nut chicken, with extra shoyu cream sauce. The chicken came out with very little sauce on it, and a minuscule amount of mango sauce. Lots of garlic chunks in the garlic mashed that really overwhelmed the potatoes. The veggies tasted a little burnt. The chicken was not as moist as before. I was actually pretty disappointed with the meal as prices have inched up, and meal quality has gone down.  Kudos to our server Jason who was fantastic and did everything right. Too bad he doesn't cook lol",

The outdoor seating is well laid out and has misters that make it very tolerable on a warm day.   But.... the food is vastly overpriced and the portions are smaller that I would expect. I went there a few weekends ago with a large group and we ordered a mix of dishes. I had a Cuban sandwich and a CA roll.  The sandwich was meh, just ok. The wife had pork tenderloin and did not like it. The CA roll was good, but anyone should be able to get that roll right.   For the price, I was a little disappointed. If you are looking for a place to hang with friends, this would be a good choice.  For me, I was looking for a great meal and Kona did not quite deliver.",

We ordered the special crab crunch roll, regular special crab roll, Atlantic roll, philly roll, spicy ahi roll, and gyoza. All the rolls pretty much looked and tasted the same. They were a bit on the small side and lacked the depth of flavor that I normally expect from sushi. Maybe the \"regular menu\" sushi items are a bit better (someone ordered a nigiri platter and it looked delicious) but as far as happy hour goes I wasn't blown away. Again, though, for about $4 a plate, not terrible. I also ordered the Happy Hour Margarita, which was good and strong.   Our waiter was prompt and we didn't have to wait long for his attention even though we sat at the sushi bar away from his other tables. For dessert we had the brownie a la mode thing, which sounded CRAZY expensive at $7.50, but the brownie was huuuuuge and decadent and the perfect texture. We split it between the three of us and it was more than enough.  Bottom line: Probably won't come back here for sushi but may return to try other menu items and drinks and desserts.",

After today, the chances of us ever returning are very slim due to our mediocre experience. Our waiter was nothing more than just \"okay.\" We ordered 1 order of sliders (medium rare) for the 2 of us to share and my boyfriend finished his slider while I was eating my other dish. Once I began to eat my slider, I realized it was much softer than I have had before. When I looked at the inside of my burger after I already took several bites out of it, I saw that my burger was completely raw. When I notified the server, she was not apologetic for the incident; all she said was \"I'll let them know.\" Then, left the raw burger at the table. After becoming impatient and waiting for our check longer than we should have, we saw our waiter dancing and doing nothing at the waitress stand opposed to serving her waiting guests. I have never felt compelled to write a Yelp review ever, but this was just unacceptable.",

We wanted the happy hour but the happy hour is only outside in the patio and there wasn't enough seats for 11 of us and the tables were first come first serve. I was happy we sat inside as it seemed it was too loud sitting outside. The food was good and the waiter was very attentive. There are lots of choices and the prices are  reasonable with large portions.",

The hostess didn't really help, she didn't even say Hello! I had to go back up to the front to get a menu.   Once we sat down it took a little longer than we expected to have someone come over. But once he did our drinks came out fast. We asked about specials and the young man was knowledgeable about them but didn't do a good job of \"Selling\" them! We finally settled on two steak sandwiches... Very bland, very fatty piece of meat, little dry and wasn't cook to the temp I had asked for! The bread was good, and the garlic aioli was good but all the rest of it I could pass in life and not care!!   *Our server did keep our drinks filled ( that gets a star)!  Dessert: hmmm... Yeah another little disappointment! Red velvet cake was dry. But key lime was decent!   All n all I think this place was all hyped up for nothing. Disappointed! Won't go back. But that's just us!   GOOD LUCK HAPPY EATING",

We have tried the patio and the inside multiple times trying to figure out what the attraction is that others have to this joint. The patio definitely has a better vibe, but each time we see the weird waiter. When I said weird, I mean the guy has black died long hair in a samurai ponytail and a full face of make up. We have found rice in the the \"clean\" forks (which the weird waiter blew off like it was normal) and the drinks have been extremely average; however, the food bites for happy hour are tasty and cheap, and the patio offers a fun get together experience for friends. The only downside to the patio...it is a very tight fit between tables...a bit uncomfortable for someone who likes their space.",

We went out for steaks 2 nights previous, so we were looking for a good place for fish or sushi.   After a quick search on Yelp, I suggested Kona Grill. Based on the reviews by fellow yelpers, I thought it sounded right up our alley. Plus, I LOVE Asian Fusion. We were not disappointed!   My friend had never had sushi, so at the recommendation of our server I ordered the Houston roll. Tuna, Cream Cheese, & Jalapeno wrapped in soy paper. She loved loved loved it!! So much in fact that she has texted me several times with a sushi craving! Yipeee!   BFF ordered the Lemon Grass crusted Halibut. Fabulous!   I ordered the Pan Seared Ahi. It was covered in a sweet chili sauce and seared to perfection. Served with steamed rice and sauteed spinach. Aside from the rice (wish it had been brown), I devoured it. Woulda licked the plate clean if I could have!!   Definitely try this place, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

Been to Hawaii many times, including my wedding, and never tasted this bland of food. Appetizers errr over salted and entrees were undercooked. Thank god they couldn't screw up the sushi.",

The caterpiller roll featured eel and avocado.  The sunshine roll is spicy salmon topped with lemon.  hamachi kyuri is sashimi of yellowtail in ponzu sauce.  Finally we left our last selection to the discretion of the chef.  We recieved crab wrapped in salmon.  All four were enjoyed with a couple of beers in ice cold glasses.  Overall a wonderful meal, we will be back.",

    "text": "Yuck!!!  What kind of generic ass Japanese restaurant is this??!!  I think it's supposed to be some type of asian fusion??  The feel of Kona is very commercialized and seemed like it fell into the category of being 'just another chain restaurant.'    My BF and I were in the beautiful Boca Park area doing some shopping and was getting hungry for dinner.  Being that we're always trying to find new joints to eat at, I saw this place, looked it up on yelp, saw that there were awesome reviews, and suggested we try it.  From what I remember, it is a rather large restaurant with a lot of seating.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of food they offered.  The layout of the menu really reminded me of like an Elephant Bar or Cheesecake factory.  They had a bunch of random ass dishes that consisted of things such as: pizzas, flatbreads, egg-rolls, pot-stickers, salads, noodles, sushi.  Well, we passed on the dinner menu and leaned towards sushi since thats what I thought this place was.    Their sushi menu is a big fat joke.  My BF started off with a $6 seaweed salad that was served on a big ass plate.  I kid you not, the amount of seaweed they put on there was the size of a fucking tablespoon.  I may be exaggerating a bit but I was damn disappointed with the quantity placed before us.  I really felt like they straight took $6 out of my pocket.  Robbed!!! Don't bother with this dish.  We also ordered some salmon sashimi pieces ($9.50), sushi rolls/hand rolls, and one of their chef's plate: a yellowtail jalapeno sashimi with ponzu and cilantro ($11.00).  What a disgrace to Japanese food.  This shit tasted horrible.  I cannot believe the quality of fish they used.  It was cut funny and left a horrible aftertaste.  I didn't bother eating any of the sashimi dishes after the first bite.  I also ordered a side of rice and had to return it twice.  How do you mess up rice??  The first bowl he brought out was hard and dry as hell.  Eww!!  I can't believe they served that, it was not even edible.  You can tell it's been sitting in the cooker for a while.  He brought out another bowl and it was the exact same thing so I passed on it.  To make things worse our server was rude.  He didn't do much and I had to wave him down to keep him updated on the status of our dining experience (ie. rice, drinks, blah).  For the most part he just took our order, brought us our bill, we paid, then bounced.   Never Again.",

Everything was pretty tasty and there was a nice buzz going in the bar and patio area.  It was a good meal and i would definitely go back!  There were four of us and for all that food and drinks it was only $70! (not including tip)",

If your going make sure you get there early because this place fills up quickly.Their Happy Hour is Monday-Friday from 3pm-7pm. During the summer they have tables outside & there is also a bar inside. I know there were a few times we had to wait for a while because the place was P-A-C-K-E-D!! The Happy Hour Menu is the BEST! My favorite happy hour  sweet & spicy shrimp,calamari and their sushi rolls. The prices are all reasonable (approx $3-$5). It gets pretty busy & chaotic in there, but the servers(at least the ones I've experienced) have consistently been very patient, calm & friendly.   If your in Vegas this is definitely one spot worth going to.",

Next I had Kona club with fries which was nice, johan had Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries, his had been sitting under heat lamp for a while so when delivered was not the hottest or freshest.

Lots of people from work, and some other guests in our group. (About 15 total) We are in the upstairs section and the server there was just a bit dismissive and slightly rude.   Examples:  1. Ask for a wine list. Response: \"I'll get it in a minute. I've got to see what these people (in a different group) want.\" 2. Ask for a glass of water (after we have ordered several rounds). Response: \"I'll only have two hands and I have to deliver these first.\"   I stayed for three drinks but left early because service like that isn't fun. The drinks were good.

He asked to keep my credit card, I was hesitant since he seemed like he was on drugs. But I was Hungry and decided to trust him. When I came back 20 minutes later expecting to have food. He asked me what I ordered, I laughed and thought he was joking. I told him that if he had not ordered it, to forget it since I was in a rush. This is when the bartender lied and told me that he had ordered it when I asked. Then 5 minutes later he gave me a ticket with a time stamp that clearly showed he just put in my order. When I confronted him, he told the truth that he just ordered it, but it would be ready quickly. I told him I didn't have time and just to forget it. He then told me I would have to speak with a manager to cancel it.  I spoke with JC the manager and he said they would take care of it and sorry for the confusion. Jc was great and was completely aware that this guy was wrong. This is when the bartender confronted me and asked \"why I was trying to get him in trouble\" he told me about \"his family\".  If he is so concerned with his family, he should get off the drugs and try and do his job correctly.",

It is now definitely more corporate in my opinion. They food and drink selections are not as nearly inventive or fresh as they once were.  But if I'm having a business lunch or happy hour with some 40-50 year olds with a known taste for middle america it's difficult to beat this place.  Just the hint of an Asian spine on Americana.

I'm not a huge salmon fan, but for some reason I ordered the miso glazed salmon salad for lunch. I really need to be in the mood to order salmon and today I was. Kona Grill did not disappoint. The salmon was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The dressing on the salad is amazing! I would love to get that recipe!  The portion of salmon was huge, something I would expect for dinner. I loved it!  My companion ordered the tacos, a combination of the macadamia nut chicken and the shrimp. She really loved the macadamia nut chicken tacos, but said the shrimp was a bit bland. She said the fried Rice that came with the dish was OK, but not great.  We started the meal by ordering an appetizer calamari.  It had a light dusting of chili on it that was nice and came with a side of aioli.  The calamari was tender and very fresh. The batter however, needed more seasoning. We added a lot of lemon and salt. Once we did that it was delicious.  Something I don't normally comment on are the drinks. We both ordered iced tea. It was probably the best restaurant Ice-T I've ever had. I also want to complement the staff. They were very attentive from the moment we walked in until they said goodbye when we left. If it weren't for the seasoning issue, I would give Kona Grill five stars. I will definitely go back and try something else.",

I've been here countless times, and this is my first review, specifically because I'd like to bring light to one of the best servers I've had. Tom is amazing. He was around every time we needed him, and has a fun personality that makes the atmosphere that much better. I'll only be returning when he's working from here on out. Thank you Tom!!",

The moscow mule is tasty and the overall vibe is great. Only 4 stars because if you sit at the bar area, the service is not that great and you find yourself waiting forever to order or have them follow up.",

I didn't have my id which is understandable, so I took the liberty in sitting at a table to order a few food items off of the happy hour menu. My girl friends however, wanted to sit at the bar and have a shot and a martini. We had JUST ARRIVED. The bartender was not only rude, but was also discriminating against my gfs by refusing to serve them shots after he had already served them one round of martinis. They were not intoxicated by any means. We JUST GOT THERE.   Managers, Janet and Ryan, were summoned and didn't do anything about the situation and instead decided to argue for at least 5 min over reasons we still don't understand. I'm just trying to order some food and my friends were just trying to have a good time but they got denied of their time. Even the group of older gentlemen sitting at the bar agreed that the service we received was uncalled for and discriminating. I have nothing else to say other than...  My server Nicole, on the other hand, was a delight. I had no qualms with her!! Thanks Nicole, for putting my order to-go considering my gfs were denied service.",

We ordered the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls to start which were both very yummy.  I ordered the grilled salmon and herb salad which is probably the tastiest salad I've ever had in my life and I don't know how I've never had it before... All I know is I'll be going back to have it again!  My boyfriend had the full order of the Kona Churrasco and this is why I'm giving 4 stars and not 5.  The first time they brought his food out, they only brought out a half order even though he ordered the full, so they took it back and said they would fix it.  My boyfriend was fine with that since we were still working on our appetizers, but he reminded them that he wanted the full order and wanted it medium rare.  When they brought it back out, it was cooked to medium well.  My boyfriend went ahead and ate it anyway and said it was very good, he just would have preferred the meat to be medium rare.  We will go back to Kona Grill again though because overall the meal was delicious.",

Had reservations for Mother's Day and took an hour and a half to get our orders.  Almost two hours for one person in our group. Only 8 people in our group. Orders were misplaced and given to other patrons. We also were almost given other people's orders. Very disorganized and the manager was clearly over his head and had no clue what he was doing. Neither did our waitress. Very unprofessional as the waitress kept telling us when she went to the kitchen to see where our order was, she said she got yelled at. Kona Grill is definitely not the classy place it used to be. Very disappointed in the direction it is going. People may enjoy going there for drinks, but the restaurant is terrible. I will not return to my once favorite place. Bu bye Kona.",

Service was excellent.  My friend and I had the sea bass.  Other members of the party chose multiple Happy Hour food choices.  Everyone seemed very satisfied with their food.  My HH mojito was good; used the limes to tone down the sweetness.  The spicy edamame was very tasty.  I didn't think I'd like it but it wasn't too spicy hot and the sauce very flavorful.  The sea bass was delicious!  I don't typically order sea bass, but my friend does and she even commented on how good it was.  The waitress commented that it was her favorite and I can see why.  The sea bass came with Jasmine rice and green beans (the waitress said we could change out the sides if we wanted to, but we kept to the original entree as featured on the menu).  Both my friend and I cleaned our plates!  Considering the portion of the sea bass, it was at the threshold of what I was comfortable paying for such an entree.  The menu has changed a lot since the last time I was here.  I found myself struggling as to what to order that night; so many choices I was wanting to try.  I'll definitely be returning as the fried soft shell crab dishes look intriguing, along with lamb tagine and a few other entrees that caught my eye.  Being we are here in the Fall, the interior temperature of the restaurant was very agreeable.  I look forward to returning.",

Four of us went for dinner. Why they leave the side doors open when it's over 100F outside is beyond me. It was very hot and uncomfortable inside. Made worse by the misters on the patio which blew the humidity right through those open doors. Service was terrible. When the waitress brought our drinks, she put them down so carelessly that everything sloshed over the edge. The cocktails themselves were so weak you could not even taste the alcohol. One person in our party was served their food fairly quickly and the other three had to wait almost ten minutes before their food arrived, and when it finally did, the first person's dinner was cold, as our guest was a polite guy and did not want to start eating his food before everyone else was served as well. And to top it all off, the waiter who cleared our table, picked up a bowl of soy sauce without paying enough attention and spilled half of it on the dress and shoes of one of our guests. With all the restaurants right there in Boca Park, and Downtown Summerlin, you'd think they would try harder and do better. Wont be going there again.",

It was expectedly a little busy downstairs and I hate when the water from the fans totally soak you (I saw this recently in another lady's review of this location too) so we thought we'd try upstairs. MUCH better! It was warmer but there was a lovely breeze from the fans and the water coming from them wasn't as bad. It also wasn't as busy upstairs which was good, although that might have been because the sound wasn't on the TVs for the game. This didn't overly bother us bc we could still see what was going on, but may not be for everyone. The screens were also bigger upstairs so there was a great view of the game from pretty much every seat. We got a Mai Tai and a Mule from the HH menu and loved them. Quite strong but very tasty. We also ordered some calamari and the avocado rolls. The portion size was great, especially for HH and the calamari was thinly breadcrumbed and generally good with the tastiest sauce to accompany. The avocado rolls were different and also very good. A little greasy if anything, but we enjoyed them.  We would definitely pop back here to watch the sports and for some drinks, maybe even to try a few more things on their HH menu. Great little spot!",

On a nice fall day where the weather is a perfect 70 degrees all day, the outdoor dining was comfortable.  On this particular day, it wasn't busy.  However, I think the customer service could use a little help. For a day that wasn't busy, the service was slow, even when it appeared there was enough wait staff. Although the wait staff seemed like good and nice people, I think the customer service could use some improvement. I know what it is. It's a restaurant that has a HI restaurant name, that started in AZ but probably not run and owned by anyone that is from HI, but visited HI. Therefore, it lacks the ALOHA SPIRIT!!!",

On a positive note, within that twenty minutes, the view is nice and I was able to capture about 5 Pokemon in my utter boredom waiting for service. You are also in range of 2 different PokeStops. That was pretty sweet.",

Little pricey as always my thoughts never presented negatively. On that note I'm just saying.",

And I have been in customer service for 14 years.  She was quick, she was funny, she paid very close attention to our needs.

Lots of half price choices for food: about 7 sushi rolls, AMAZING calamari, tasty potstickers, crispy avocado egg rolls, satays, tacos, sliders, and so on.  Also, 3 pizzas for $6 each.   Drinks include beer, sake bombers, wine, flavored cosmos, and margaritas ranging from $4-$7.50.  Happy hour is always packed here.  Luckily, Kona has a lovely outdoor patio to enjoy their offerings.  Lunch and dinner is also a winner here.  I LOVE the asian salad with macadamia nut chicken.  Chopped napa cabbage, onions, toasted almonds, sesame seeds, and ramen noodles all tossed in a sesame vinaigrette.  Light, crunchy, and refreshing.   I've been pleased with the pad thai many times, along with the macadamia nut chicken entree served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and topped with a creamy, dreamy shoyu sauce.  Delectable.   Finish your meal with a passion fruit creme brulee and you leave feeling pleased with \"fusion\"",

I recently took some friends from San Francisco there and they loved it. You can always count on Kona to be a hot spot, with something for everyone and who can resist the people watching. When the weather is good, make sure to get there for happy hour, dig into a little sushi and their flatbread pizza is great. However, once you claim that outdoor seat, think carefully before you leave since the seating becomes rare as the evening approaches.",

The chicken satay was so delicious that we almost ordered a second round had we not been so full! My son rarely eats his entire meal but devoured the entire thing. The kids Mac n cheese wasn't just your standard boxed Mac n cheese... It was so great I had to steal a few bites! The waiter was very attentive and helpful with choosing what to order. I highly recommend coming here. My husband and I live across town but will go out of our way to come back. I also recommend trying the jasmine green tea. I don't like ice tea but after trying my husbands I had to order one for myself. Great experience!",

After a brutal round of golf @ angel park, this is definitely my \"it\" place to wind down have a drink & a light meal. Service is fantastic, friendly crowd, great food & did I mention Reverse Happy Hour!  Sushi was the craving for the night, so I snapped up the ahi wanton crisp, spicy tuna roll & the crab crunch roll. The ahi was magnificent the horseradish sauce was prominent, not over the top, delectable & delicious, just give me a bag of the wanton crisps which accompanied it & it'll put a smile on my face any day.  Spicy tuna is well spicy tuna, but for some odd reason this edges out possibly the best spicy tuna I've had (sushi para @ chicago), its a remarkably minimal roll, small & explosive in taste (like a grenade of yum!).   Closing out with the crab crunch roll as recommended by the bartender (quite a friendly-chap). Thank you so much for this recommendation, I can finally stop loathing eel sauce! Spot on, great texture, can I have these as mini-snack bites!  In fairness I'm not one to care for ambiance unless its fine dining, my first yelp 5* can't wait to be handing more of these out!",

(She is from Michigan and they have one near her home.)    We got there at 6pm.  Easily downed 3 martinis and some apps.   I've never had sushi (GASP!) so this popped by sushi-cherry.  Yum!  We had a crab surprise, California roll, chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps.  Our waiter, Geoffrey, was fantastic.  He made a Last Call for happy hour drinks.  I have never had that at a bar.  How nice!  We enjoyed it so much, we came back a couple days later for happy hour.  We sat at the bar and had crab surprise and pot stickers.  SO GOOD!  We enjoyed the people and the ambiance.  But I think if they didn't have happy hour, this place would be dead.  The restrooms are located back in the restaurant and there was like no one there both nights we went (Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Friday after Thanksgiving).

    "text": "We've been to Kona Grill a few times to hit up their Happy Hour special.  It runs from I think 3-7 then again from 10-12 weekdays, Saturdays its during the afternoon (I can't recall the exact times), and Sunday it's all day.  I'd have to say that it gets pretty crowded during the Happy Hour times - especially if you're going during the week after work or something.  There's normally open seating at the sushi bar if you don't mind though.  I like it here.  The food is a great value with their Happy Hour pricing.  They have a list of apps at half off and also some other items for 6 bucks... as well as some drinks for half off.  Their food is quality, ambience is great, service is not bad considering how busy it always is too.  I've tried almost all the sushi on their Happy Hour Menu and to me, it's just OK.  Get the wave roll, it's pretty refreshing (I don't think it's a steal at 6 bucks though).  I also like the Crab Crunch I think it's called.  Other than that, I can't think of anything else that jumps off as awesome.   If you are looking for amazing sushi, go to a Japanese restaurant.  My favorite thing, however, is the two burgers for 6 bucks.  They are smaller sized burgers with a side of fries.  The meat is top quality and its its topped off with a bunch of great tasting things.  I like it and order this every time.  I normally like pot stickers, but I'm not crazy about the ones here (my friends think opposite, they like them).  The meat in it is loose and doesn't stick together.  I think that's why it puts me off.  Anyway, the lettuce wraps are good, the calamari is good... everything is pretty good.  Not OMG, but good!  This is definitely one of the more generous happy hour spots in terms of their specials and times that they offer the great deals.",

They seem to recognize that their patio vibe and generous happy hour selections, along with the see and be seen drive by location in Boca Park are a winning combo.  Lately, I see all new faces within the staff, and the last couple of visits I've noticed some fairly heavy hip hop music being played in the bar/patio area. I hope this isn't the telltale sign of the demise (or last ditch effort to pull out of a slump) of the bar. The reggae or house music that used to be the regular is what set the tone for a great time (think beach vibe on a beautiful Sunday, and trendy lounge on any summer week night after 9pm). The \"older\" Summerlin singles were even able to tolerate it, and those guys are in there spitting some major game on the regular. Rumor is, the restaurant is closing soon for a remodel to make a second story patio. As long as it isn't constant rap and hip hop playing through the speakers, I look forward to some fresh changes at Kona! Lets hope they dont lose sight of why their patio has been such a hot spot for over two decades.",

The only thing that I remember disliking were the sliders during happy hour... they were just bland, flavorless and undercooked for what I specified.  I generally get pretty bad service here, though, and that's where the 2 star rating comes from.  There's always something that happens that makes me say wtf?  One time I had to say excuse me multiple times to a group of servers blocking the entry way between the patio and the inside when I was trying to go to the bathroom.  They were just in their own world, chit chatting and being oblivious.  Another time, our waiter was mostly AWOL from our table and we repeatedly had to flag down other servers to ask where ours was.   It wasn't particularly busy, so no clue what the deal was.  Another time we were seated outside and it was cold... we requested that they turn on the heat lamps but were told it wasn't in their budget to have them on during that time of year.  Another time there was this obviously intoxicated man floating around from table to table in the patio area trying to chat up female customers.  When he went to the bar, the bartender high fived him and served him another shot.  I just feel like they could do a lot more here to improve the customer experience and act like they give a shit.  The food is good and it's wasted on an establishment with subpar, unprofessional staff.",

Service was good, Food came out pretty quick, however I waited a while for drinks and afterwards once we asked for our check, bill didnt come out for another 20 minutes, we would have ordered a few more cocktails if we knew we would have been waiting that long to check out... otherwise, pretty pleasant experience, Drinks, Calimari, Flatbread, and Shrimp Lettuce wraps for under $30 bucks!!!!",

    "text": "This place has a pretty decent happy hour. Half price appetizers as well as some pretty cheap drinks. Very cheap sake bombs !   Happy hours gets pretty busy, and is only available in the bar and the patio area. Patio area is great when weather outside is nice - but on hot summer nice, it isn't very ideal. So, if you do go during bad weather, be sure to get there when it starts so you can get seats, as there isn't much seating inside.   Food: Calamari was decent. There was too much batter and not at all oily. Comes with a spicy sauce which was good, but I still prefer the sauce offered at Olive Garden.   BBQ Chicken pizza, I wouldn't get again. Sauce was weird and the chicken was dry. They also cut it very oddly... haha.   Potstickers have good taste but are fried and I prefer mine steamed.   Tuna wonton crisps are good. Tuna always seems fresh. Comes with a wasbai sauce that I'm not too fond of, but still good.   Overall - definitely a place to try for happy hour. Not sure if I would go there otherwise.",

From the hostess who was dressed like she was going to the nightclub (every time we come in it's a skimpy short dress, skin tight, and cleavage... who wants to see that on a high schooler?) to the bartenders (Megan) lackluster attitude... who is training this people? How come everyone who works here seems like it's their first restaurant job? No sense of urgency whatsoever. It's sad, because the food is very good. I order the Picasso roll every time I go there, or the flatbreads. Very good quality food! The restaurant does often smell of sewage, for some reason. But bad service puts a much worse taste in your mouth than food. I'm sorry, but my years of patronage here have ended. Seems like there is new management and they don't know what they're doing. I have worked in the restaurant industry as a manger for 20 years, and the quality of this place has severely dropped over time.",

And went down the street to Echo and Rig for a True HH. $3 all drafts. And pints at that. Also $1 hot dogs. Plus much more.  Don't bother with Kona. Not worth it. Over priced snobs.",

There was only one other couple at the time on the patio and the waitress immediately mentioned to us that we were to early for happy hour (starts at 3:00PM) We ordered the ahi tuna crisp as an appetizer....... it was very good!!! I ordered the chopped Kona salad with pecan crusted chicken. It was good.... the chicken was very well cooked, flavorful and not dry. The salad was not a chopped salad by my definition...... it was not chopped any more than a regular garden type salad.... very disappointing.... I was really set on the finely chopped salad, not enough dressing for my taste either. My husband had the fish of the day, which was red snapper. He said it was okay.... nothing to get excited about.... a little dry, and served with plain white rice.... very bland. By the time we wrapped up our meal, it was almost 3:00 and time for Happy Hour.... the patio was full,  and from what I could tell, that is what this place is best at. Stick to the happy hour appetizers and drinks. It is more their specialty.",

The one thing you will always notice is that the outdoor patio is perpetually busy and crowded.  We've dined inside and outside and you definitely want to dine outside when possible.  The vibe is totally different and sometimes depressing when dining inside.  Its a little dark and kind of generic in terms of interior design.  The food is pretty solid because they the chef knows that tasty dipping sauce is the key to any tapas-style plate.  Their sauces for all their plates are tasty and flavorful.

They assured us they were not closing and that we could sit there, however throughout our meal they pretty much closed up show, put all the chairs up around us at the bar and we generally felt rushed.

    "text": "Back after they were closed for a long time for a remodel. I got some bad news for you regulars- happy hour prices went UP! It was bound to happen. That remodel looks pricey! A second story was added and the previously dark dining room is now open and more complementary to the bar area.  What used to be half price rolls are now $4.50 and specialty rolls $10 during happy hour. New happy hour menu items include lobster & tuna flatbread and BBQ flatbread. I think a few of the rolls are new too. I had the Kona chopped salad while we dined on the patio during my latest visit. The dressing was a bit overwhelming (honey mustard) and something more tangy would be my choice next time. There was a ton of chicken in the salad so props. Not too bad for $14. My white wine wasn't very cold so that happened. No props.  Gone are the awkward metal chairs and tables from the patio and in their place are stylish and softer chairs and tables and some firepit seating as well! Nice. Looks like Kona is set to remain Summerlin's best and most popular happy hour spot.",

    "text": "I had been to the location at Fashion Show and remembered it being decent. Went back for happy hour with 2 of my friends last week, and I don't think we'll ever be back.   You seat yourself for happy hour in certain areas, so we made our way to the top and found 1 open table in the back. The waitress noticed us fairly quickly and took drink orders. After ordering a few appetizers and rolls, we didn't see our waitress for at least 30 minutes. It probably took over 20 minutes for our drinks to come out and over 45 minutes for the food. The least our waitress could have done was check on us, and let us know our food was on the way.  One of our rolls (the voodoo roll) was so disgusting. Normally my friends and I aren't ones to complain and send food back, but this one was unbearable.  We were hesitant on ordering a replacement roll as we knew it would take a long time to come out. We ordered it anyway, and of course it took at least 20-25 minutes to get our 1 roll.   Then, another 20 to get the check.   Now that I'm thinking about it, restaurants normally do a \"last call\" when happy hour is coming to an end, and that was not given to us either.  It would be one thing if our waitress was stacked with tables and was apologetic for the wait, but she was so nonchalant, and didn't even smile.   Only reason for 2 stars is the crab crunch roll!",

The layout is similar with just a more open space overall and looks much brighter than it used to be.  The happy hour is great for drinks along with Asian fusion dishes and sushi.  The bartenders are very friendly and always make sure you're not empty handed drink wise.  Pricing is very reasonable and the portions are great for family style dining or just individual dining.  Dishes that I recommend include the yellowtail jalapeno, chicken lettuce wraps, and the chopped salad.  The sushi is quite fresh, a bit generic compared to sushi restaurants but they have all the basic rolls and a great happy hour menu for sushi.  Kona Grill used to be the local hangout for drinks and food but it seems it has lost its former shine or I must be getting older!",

For drinks, the moscow Titos mule for $8 is super refreshing or kirin sake bomb.  However, sometimes the food can be inconsistent in sushi food taste and servers service, wish they would be more consistent. Had an off experience with the freshness of their tuna and had to send back because I wasnt comfortable eating fresh tuna that was brownish in color . Tuna that is fresh should be pink to red in color. Our server claimed that \"that's our tuna\" with out offering it to be remade or a substitute to order. He kinda just ignored us the rest of the meal. Its nothing personal,  but he seemed to take it personally and this service deserves 1 star rating. Another instance, I've gone and our server wasn't aware what came in one of their sushi rolls that was apparently new on the menu because it wasnt printed on their normal menu. I have dined at Kona for over to 10 years.   However. Our food runner was excellent, super professional and promptly brought us more avocado sauce in minutes delivered on a dish and napkin, very 5 star service. Wish their wait staff and sushi chefs would match.",

I just wish the hostess could've greeted us with a nicer attitude instead of a nonchalant one. Other than that I was glad she gave us a booth because coincidentally seated in the booth behind is was my bf's college friend.   Once seated, our waitress who had her blonde hair braided to the side asked us for our drink orders. She was very nice, attentive, and perky. After getting our drinks our waitress gave us a few min then took our dinner orders. I had the truffle lobster mac n cheese and bf had medium steak.   The food was amazing! My mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever had. Bf loved his meal, and that's a big compliment because he knows a lot about food. However, the pineapple on his steak was a bit sour. Other than that we really enjoyed our meal.  A few things I really like about the place is their decor. The contemporary interior made for a comfortable dinning experience.The aquarium was nice. The TVs add a nice touch to the place too. The booths are very comfortable. Kudos to the owners :)  A few other things they could improve on is their service. Our server obviously did not know how to open and serve a bottle of wine correctly. I work as a hostess at a restaurant in the strip and their hostess could use a lecture about good service. Other that those little things the restaurant is a really nice place to eat and hang out. =D",

And that was only mildly entertaining.  Kona has a good quality standard, that rates with many other mid-range chains.  I do really appreciate the indoor/outdoor bar layout.  That's a good design and works well for quite a few places here in town.    Negative points for Boca Park's parking situation.  Sorry to pass those along to Kona, but I would do so for any of the establishments in that strip.  Nothing like parking at REI and walking across a blazing parking lot to have a beer and appetizers.  Sufficed to say, I will likely return to Kona on occasion, as it's a good central meetup location for most people on the West side of town.  Maybe something will surprise me one day and I'll up the marks on my review.",

So we get our sushi and the regular burger which was all fantastic. We aren't even half way through the entree when Destiny asks us if we are having dessert. Can we finish our entrees and see how we feel? We decided against dessert rather quickly and within two minutes of us saying we weren't going to have anything else she had dropped the check. My husband was in the middle of his burger. Nothing worse then feeling super rushed on date night. We paid in cash and she quickly picked up the bill just has my husband finished his burger. We most likely would return for the food cause it is really good but probably stick to the bar area. I love dessert and probably would have had some but feeling rushed put a damper on things so we went to the Cheesecake Factory next door for some nice cheesecake.",

Macadamia chicken has risen to $20!!!  What the freak!!!  This would be $10-12 in most restaurants!!  $18.75 for MEATLOAF!!!!  What is going on here????  Six months ago the prices were $5 less ---who can afford these prices???  NOT US!!  And I make $ 60,000/year!!  The service was better toward tip time, of course. The food was very good, but they serve much SMALLER portions for much LARGER money!!  Lunch for two was $60 with tip!!!  You have to be a millionaire to eat here - this is not for the middle class anymore!!",

I wouldn't have thought it possible to talk over the \"music\", but several of the foul mouthed patrons in the bar managed the feat nicely.  Those of us in the front part of the dining area were regaled with their fascinating life experiences.  No stars for ambiance.   I had the lemon grass swordfish on my waiter's recommendation. My dinner consisted of a 2 oz, piece of swordfish, a small scoop of white rice and an absolutely inedible portion of bok choy.  For this I paid $24. Ridiculous.  No stars for my food.  Ms. Whodotoo had the macadamia crusted chicken.  She liked it.  I'll give them a star for that.  The waiter managed to add an extra $5.50 to our bill for a beer we didn't have.  He corrected the error when it was called to his attention.  Given that there were four items on our bill (two dinners and two beverages), I suppose the waiter can be forgiven for his confusion.  All in all, a poor experience.",

I went with a party of 4 and we wound up having a blast. We ordered a bunch of sake. we also have an appetizer the shrimp. I didn't really like the shrimp it had too much mayonnaise on it I definitely wouldn't recommend that. But the sushi rolls are really really good and the dessert was spectacular we had on the Snickers pie. And we also have the chocolate fudge brownie. Which was both delicious overall I had a great experience am I getting 4 to 5 stars.",

There are some specialty rolls (Volcano, Bama, & Sunshine Rolls) and entrees (Macadamian Nut Chicken & Miso Sea Bass) that I have really enjoyed at Kona...But far too often the food is flat.   The service is real nice and friendly, but often staffed for inefficiency rather than customer service.  The thing that gets me the most is that everyone raves about their Happy Hour...but literally none of the food or drinks make me want to come back.  Not a fan of the tacos/HH sushi rolls/mini burgers...the funny thing is there are multiple places in Boca Park that doo all these items better!  The Happy Hour drinks are cheap...and taste like they are cheap!  The restaurant is usually dead apart from the weekends because everyone is out on the patio trying up their pretentiousness status...I would rate Kona with 1 Star if I rating the crowd and atmosphere attracted to their patio.",

I loved the Red Sangria and the Spicy Tuna Roll. Avocado Egg Rolls were pretty good. Spinach Artichoke dip was just ok, the texture was fine but it really didn't have much flavor, I actually had to add salt which I never do. Brio's is way better.

    "text": "This was our third stop during our Sunday bar hopping schedule. Typically, I read up on the places near by as we munch an appetizer and savor a tasty beverage. On this occasion we skipped that formality as the previous bartender said that Kona had great food and cheap happy hour prices.  When we arrived, we quickly found two seats at the outdoor bar. I will have to give them a nod for places to people watch. Across from us was a Wilem Dafoe look alike in a black wife beater. He kept muttering to himself (I secretly suspect that he was arguing with himself). A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra  Ok back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.  Now sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.  What we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area. The taste was ok, if a bit bland, and the serving temp was decidedly too warm for sushi.  Ok, bottom line here folks, stop buy Kona for happy hour drinks, watch the carnival of lost souls huddled around the bar, and skip the food.",

We finally got our \"actual\" server who took our food order. We ordered calamari and chicken satays, both were disappointing and we sent our chicken back for being dry and disgusting. Locals love this place because the food was once outstanding and the happy hour prices were unbeatable. I don't think the food or service were enough to make me come back.

The outside bar is lively and this review does NOT pertain to that.  The menu always poses a dilemma for me.  Is this a sushi restaurant with a completely empty sushi bar, or do they specialize in Hawaiian entrees or pasta. The menu is a confusion at best.  Thinking I had ordered the wrong thing the two previous visits I had the Hawaiian rib steak. How can that be bad.  It was tough and full of grizzle, the mashed potatoes not mashed and unseasoned, and the entire plate was covered in not completely fried onions.  There won't be a next time for me",

Some are half off, some are discounted apps and sushi and drinks ranging from $3ish-7 with most about $6. It was rather busy, but we were able to find a seat and served quickly.   Normally I'm not a roll person and I know that but went with the flow of what is \"recommended\" in reviews. We grabbed one of the specialty rolls - the Voodoo (crawfish mix, avocado, topped w/habanero tuna mix & chili masago) which we got based on the crawfish.It was decent and I like that it's a bit spicy. We also got a crab crunch roll I believe since I happen to like crunchies on things and that was alright. It's good rolls if you like rolls but nothing outstanding about them.   Calamari - this was pretty good. I liked the spicy creamy sauce to go with. I would have liked it a tad crispier, but it was not undercooked or anything.   Avocado rolls - avocado anything I love but the creamy with the crispy egg roll wrapper works for me. This I did like.   Service was decent considering the fact it was a busy and full bar area.   I think it was good for happy hour and I would go again since were in Boca Park a lot. I did see flatbreads that looked great and immediately regret not getting one instead of sushi so next time.",

Sangria tastes like koolaid. I'm sure it's the mixer they use, but way too fruity and really skimpy on the cheap wine. Which I'm convinced is boxed wine and not from a bottle. It's just like bad juice.   The sushi never seems to be on point, always a let down. Asked for the spiciest roll they made and wound up with a sriracha overkill rice roll with some canned jalapenos on top. Yuck. My friend finished it, but I sure wasn't going to eat another bite. The salmon roll was just ok.   Also, weekends in the bar area are brutal. It gets packed with corvette driving mid life crisis men and pretentious wannabe Real Housewives types and I've found the service takes a dive as well.   Sorry Aloha Grill. I think we're done here.",

My party ordered the asparagus salad and a house salad with salmon. Both salads were not satisfactory. The lettuce was very wilted and disgusting. One salad was also soaked in dressing that made it unpleasant.  As usual, the drinks were a hit or miss. But the citrus punch was a winner today. Three stars only for the cute waiter, Amir! He was the bomb! Give him a raise.   My salads should have been comped btw. Barely touched my old lettuce dinner. Will come back for drinks ONLY & amir.",

The reason we keep going back is probably because of the patio seating. If you do sit on the patio, be prepared to wait. Certain servers act like you're personally hassling them by sitting out there. Nonetheless, their appetizers and sushi rolls are pretty good, as well as the desserts (the cheesecake was delicious.) I also really enjoy the sangrias. I probably wouldn't ever go if it wasn't happy hour and pay full price though.",

Of course, it is super crowded at the patio/bar area (the only places where HH is offered), so be prepared to stake out a table for a little while. Once we were seated, our server, Hunter, was awesome! We had a pretty big group, including a few kids, and he was so patient and friendly with us. The food, although a few items took awhile, was really good. The best thing, however, is that the manager continually came to check on us. He said that he'd never seen us before and wanted to make sure we had a great experience- and we did! He so sweetly comped us an extra pepperoni pizza for the kids as well. Wow!  That was really fantastic, and so appreciated. On a beautiful day, Kona Grill is an ideal place to visit!",

Comfortable outdoor patio with fans and misters The cheeseburger slider 2 per order comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles and fries. The burger was cooked as ordered and very tasty. This is la large portion by Happy Hour standards and 1 sandwich was packed to go. The chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps comes with 5 large pieces of Bibb lettuce, cucumber salad, spicy vinaigrette and a large bowl of the chicken and shrimp mixture.  This also was a great meal. With a large number of menu choices we will enjoy coming back many times.  Parking close to Kona Grill in Boca Park can be a challenge. Even if you valet, some walking will be required. However the walk is still shorter than going to most hotel restaurants. Pay attention to the customer only parking signs for the neighboring stores.",

The bar - YES, but the restaurant..not so much.  We ordered the calamari and it was horrible!!! The calamari had no meat! It seemed like they scraped off the bottom of the fryer and served it.  I thought it had to get better, but then we ordered our entree.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I don't even think it was ribeye! I think a porterhouse or something, but definitely not a ribeye.  We also ordered a couple rolls of sushi which weren't bad, but my whole dining experience was already ruined.  My mom ordered their asian salad and she said it was too sweet.  The whole experience was horrible.  Our server forgot to give us soy sauce for our sushit and we waited quite a bit to get it.   Towards the end of the meal I'm thinking I just wasted $100 on garbage!  I'm going to take the survey tomorrow and hopefully it will change something. I really liked Kona Grill and I would like to return, but based on my last visit - I doubt it.  It may just be a hit or miss kind of thing and I hope that others don't have the same dining experience so don't go to this place expecting the worst.  I still have some hope for this establishment.",

The menu here features dishes with pacific rim influences and an excellent sushi bar. The food is above average for a chain restaurant and service has always been on point.   What brings me in to Kona is their happy hour. Every night til closing, KF offers a wide array of sushi rolls, appetizers, flatbreads pizzas, and of course drinks and great prices. The sliders, and BBQ chicken flatbread are my personal favorites.  The sake bombs come with a large bottle of Kirin beer and a bottle of warm sake. Easily 3-4 drinks and a steal at $8. Happy Hour is only available on the massive patio and a few select tables inside by the bar. Though there are heaters, make sure you dress appropriately if you plan on dining on the patio.   As one the best late night spots in Summerlin, Kona is definitely worth checking out.",

I would also give a thumbs up to the Philadelphia sushi roll. A bit expensive though but it is Boca Park so it's to be expected. The outdoor seating was also wonderful.  Now here is where the 2 stars come from. In all reality I wanted to do 1.5 but it is not an option. The waiter was very disengaged and unhelpful. The girl at the entrance had more personality and made us feel more welcome than the waiter did. The sense I got from him was that he had something better to do or his mind was off somewhere else. We asked about the pork sliders pictured on the menu and his only response was \"they weren't on happy hour.\" Ok, that's nice, but are they available now? When he came back with change for the meal he actually leaned over me to put it on the table. Rude. Plenty of room to just walk up to the table and put it down and say \"thank you\" like any other person would do. I also had to ask him to repeat himself as he was quiet and was leaning on the metal fence near our table which put him a few feet away from our table. Not much tact in my opinion.  I might try eating here again but Vegas has many other options for great food and much better service.",

What keeps me coming back is the patio and the friends I share it with.  The outdoor seating is wonderful.  You get to enjoy fresh air while you sit and chat with your friends; this is a rarity in Vegas.  Due to the hot temperatures, you can be hard pressed to find a place with outdoor setting.  Kona Grill has their patio open year round so you can enjoy something other than a stale indoor environment with recycled air.  I have NEVER eaten inside, it's not what you go to Kona for.  The food can be hit or miss here.  I have found their appetizers to be more consistent than their dinners.  Servers come and go relatively quickly.  This could be because of the amazing deals they have on food/drinks; the low prices create low tips and people sit and campout at tables for hours.  Servers aren't getting tipped on full price items.  If you have ever worked industry you know this is great for your guests but sucks for your bankroll.     Kona Grill is a place you go to happy hour with your girlfriends, hit up for a mid-afternoon snack and cocktail on the weekend, or take a date you're not too sure about yet.  It's relaxed, well priced and there are plenty people to gawk at.  In Summerlin you have a lot of big players and big tits running around acting like they're still in their 20's.  Fun to watch if sports isn't your thing or your date is boring you.    As for the menu... pick something, it will be mediocre like most everything else is on the menu.  The food won't make you sick but it won't knock your socks off either!  If you're into an outside atmosphere more than memorable food and drinks than Kona is for you.  Bring a friend, grab a drink, enjoy their company and the show.",

I don't have one complaint and I'm sure that I won't.",

    "text": "Honestly super disappointed in my service tonight. I used to really love kona especially all day happy hour on sundays but it seems like every time I go back it's worse and worse. After today I'm not sure I'll be making any more visits which is really too bad!!   It started fine my margarita was pretty good!! (Tasted different than normal) my bartender was sort of pushy about his up selling but I get it. That's the job. I work in this industry too. I had a drink ordered a sushi roll first then added a chicken satay maybe 5 mins later. Got the chicken satay...chicken was dry and chewy. I ate a couple and finished the salad which is the part I like best anyway. No sushi roll yet but it is all day happy hour and was a little busy. No problem. 20 mins later I ask if it's coming soon...it was on my ticket so they must have rang it in but I'm not sure what happened. I sat another 20 mins debating on a drink before I decided to ask to cancel. The bartender Jeff insisted itd be right out (though I don't think he realized I had already asked once 20 mins prior) and seemed almost annoyed I wanted to cancel. Right as I was really trying to tell him no I was full and didn't want it of course it came. I honesty was full and wanted to leave so I was like whatever and ask for a box.  Ten mins and I'm still waiting for a box that Jeff never brought! I asked the other bartender (also Jeff) for a box and got it right away. The first Jeff pushed dessert to me 3 times before I finally put cash in the cup and just got up and left. I mean seriously... like if I say no once that's really enough. The whole thing really annoyed me. I mean cmon. I was considering another drink but I was full and annoyed i wasn't able to cancel the roll and quite frankly didn't wanna be pushed to buy anything else so oh well. I know kona has had a hard time recently so maybe it was just the night but if I do decide to go back it most certainly will be after they turn and burn into new bartenders again. (Which seems to happen often these days.)  Anyway I'd give one star but like I said I've lived here since before the renovation and have a soft spot for the place. Management needs to work on their customer service training a little.",

It doesn't get any worse than that. Our entire meal was ruined and we had a lot of food on the table left untouched, afraid of what else wasn't up to code. We were told the dish would be removed from the check (as it should) and when we got the check, guess what, we still were charged for it... Had to get a manager involved. I'm really hoping we don't get sick from this. This is my last review, we'll never be back.",

Now, not so much. Management has populated the hostess station with entry level young women, dressed inappropriately, with absolutely no people skills whatsoever. They are rude and inconsiderate.   We have stopped trying to go to Kona for an evening meal because of the intolerable conditions at the front desk.   Kona management needs a wake up call!!!",

I was watching her as she went to the bar, maybe she will bring me the sauce and the ginger, but she never came back to me.  My soy sauce then comes another 15 minutes later by my original waitress.  The food came 25 minutes after ordering as well. The service here is always horrible but the food makes up for it.

    "text": "Kona is a good place to grab lunch or dinner if you're looking to relax and kill some time. It has a patio that always has a little crowd which is fun. They recently remodeled which turned out very nice. The dining room and bar downstairs is much better than it used to be. For the remodel they added an upstairs rooftop bar with a dining area which is really cool. The food is always consistent and pretty good. I have definitely killed many hours at Kona relaxing with friends. It's not what it used to be like 10 years ago but it's still fun. Try them out.",

The chicken and broccoli stir fly was gorgeously flavorful, with cilantro and ginger, but the portion size was sadly too small. So was my mom's sushi plate. Both of our plates were fragrant and tasty, just too small. Portion sizes would suit children. Certainly not recommended for those with big appetites.  Other than that, great dining option.",

It's something that reminds me of a bar in Newport Beach, minus the beach view of course. However, I felt like the food quality is not where it use to be. I made it in time for happy hour which is a challenge during the week. They have had the same happy menu since I could remember. And the sushi..well let's just say it's probably best that you skip this route all together. I regret not snapping a photo just to show you but the color or taste was not fresh.  It's a mediocre place - the environment is what will keep me coming back.",

    "text": "10 days ago I wrote the General Manager an email and gave him an opportunity to address my issues with the food and my experience at Kona Grill.  He Never even responded.  So instead I will give my review on Yelp.  Will not be eating here again.  There are plenty of options in the area.   Hello Eric,  My name is Andrea Engle and last night my family and I celebrated my birthday at Kona Grill.  We recently moved back to Las Vegas after living in Atlanta for ten years. I was excited to find out that your restaurant was still in business. Not only that you still served my favorite macadamia nut and chicken entree. This item carried a red triangle to indicate it was a preferred dish.  My husband ordered the pork plus we had a sushi roll.  Also on the preferred dish menu.  In addition to that my child had a grill cheese.  The potatoes on my dish were warm and the actual chicken was room temperature.  The breading completely fell apart and the chicken itself was dry.  It was a complete disappointment.  The sushi roll (soft shell crab) was not good and it had a strong fish taste.  I have had better from the grocery store.  And I hate saying that but its True.  The best part of the meal was the sliced orange on my sons plate.  Our bill was over $80 which probably isn't that much except we are a family with a 5 year old and going out to eat at a restaurant on Kona Grill's scale is a treat for us, especially on my birthday.   On a positive note, the service was good.  I also work in Service Industry and thought it important to share our experience with you.  Kind Regards,  Andrea Engle",

Our waitress botched our drink order multiple times, but we had no recourse since they add 18% gratuity to parties of 7.  They even charged an extra $2 for adding ice to my scotch!!  The Omikase sashimi combo claims to have 18 pieces, but I counted 14.  What's with all the sauces?  They're trying way too hard with this: since when does sashimi need to be drenched in sauces?  Rather than accentuating the fish, the sauces ruined it.  Plus the pizza was greasy.  I won't be returning.",

The service has always been excellent, and the food? Deee-lish. The edamame is covered in coarse sea salt, just enough to notice the flavor and add a pleasant crunch. We all shared the 18-piece shashimi assortment and a gorgeous 8-piece Rainbow Roll, all authentically prepared and absolutely delectable. Their website omits the prices of their dishes, but they're pretty comparable to any other fine restaurant.They do serve a few standard American dishes, such as breaded pork tenderloin and meatloaf. I haven't tried them, but considering the sushi is mighty fine, I'd be willing to bet their other fare is pretty darn good, too.",

The sushi rolls are unamazing, but definitely edible and there are other good noshing options on the menu, such as kalamari, potstickers, etc. The margaritas are stiff, beers are the standard $3-4 on special.   The real draw of this place is the people watching, especially on a Friday evening when its packed. Kona is the preferred watering hole for the hot cougars of Summerlin, and the men that love them.   I fit into neither of these categories, but I enjoy this place a lot, and I'll probably be back.",

I've never been for dinner, but I hear its quite a scene. I always order the tacos and its enough to split with my friends. We also order appetizers so when the tacos come out its the perfect portion. Service is always great. Nothing bad to say.",

Sometimes it does get pretty noisy, but it's a fun place to go to watch a game and hang out with friends.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the happy hour drink menu... Their cosmos make me sick, they're far too sweet, the wine doesn't ever seem like that good of a deal, nor do the saki bombs.  But the food is great!!!",

I started with the Chicken Satay which was juicy and came with two sauces (peanut and a sweet sauce) that was so amazing I almost cried! Even the cabbage under the chicken had a dressing that was really delicious! Oh, forgot to mention the wine list which had more by-the-glass selections than usual and some really delicious selections too. I went out of the box and tried the Bison Burger which was also juicy and delicious. My Server, Alisha, was great too and always available when I needed her. I didn't have to wait too long to see her cause she was always checking in with me. All in all, this is by far the best experience I have had at a restaurant in a very long time. Too bad there isn't one closer to my home, I want to try all their food and see if I just ordered right or if all their plates are this amazing!",

As busy as it always is we ran up to some tables that got freed up but we're still dirty. It took the staff 25 min to clean them and we had to wipe it down ourselves with a rag we got at the bar. We let it slide and figured, it's busy no biggie. After that it took another 20 min to get our drinks ordered and another 15 to be served. We then ordered our food which came out at a good time, being that a food runner brought it to us. We never got set ups and cups for our drinks, so I got it from the bar. We waited anther 20 min for our server to come back so we could get more drink which never happened and we ask another waiter if she can get it for us. At this point I ask to speak with a manager which took 30 min for her to come. I told her about how horrible the service was and for this price point, it's unacceptable. She agreed and offered to comp some of our items. We were fine with that and if you can find our server so we can order a couple more drinks. When our server came back, we asked for 2 more sakes and he said no your cut off. He said we have a 2 limit policy in which we've never heard before. Fine, do the math. Their are 9 of us and we've ordered a total of 8 sakes, so what's the problem. He said he's going to have to bring it up to his manager. She then came all defensive and said this is our policy and I can't order you anymore drinks! I told her to look at our check before you speak with guest because we have not had 2 drinks per person. She said I'll check and walked away. Then the server came back with the drinks we ordered slammed it on the table and started to walk away. I said No! You can take these back, he tired around and said what's your problem? Are you kidding me! What's our problem? Just bring us the check. The manager dropped it off and stood at our table. Can I help you? I asked and she said no, just waiting on you. Indicating as if we were going to walk out on the bill. It was embarrassing! Another manager from the kitchen came out who was awesome! I told him the story and was very understanding. On top of it all the manager Natasha even threatened to 86 us. For What! Ryan the manager from the kitchen took care of the matter and we were able to leave in a better mood. With all the memories I have at Kona, it saddens me that this place has changed so much and for the worst.",

I'm not too adventurous with sushi.  Potstickers: Yes.. yes... and yes. Not sure what it was about these but I probably could have ordered 3 or 4 more plates. When I go back it will mostly be because I want potstickers. Nice size, tasty, nice crunch on bottom and soft on top. Nice presentation. Loved everything about these.

Luckily for me, I have Robyn and Kevin L. to show me around this foreign land. Summerlin might not be as exotic or far as I make it out to be, but I definitely need a reason to head over there.   On many occasions I was told about a happy hour that is worth checking out. It goes Monday-Friday from 4-7 and there is a reverse happy hour as well. Sit out on the patio, at the bar, or at the sushi bar and one will be guaranteed discount prices.   The drinks list is small, but the sake bomber is worth the $7.5. It is a full bottle of beer and a container of sake. One of my friends got that and I regretted getting a margarita.   The food is good, but what makes it better is the prices. Most of the basic rolls that run between $6-7 are half price. The same goes for select appetizers. The calamari are tender and delicious. Lettuce wraps are another bountiful choice that will surely please the taste buds. The specialty rolls are worth looking at for $6.   With the HH checked off my list. I must come back for their regular menu. Apparently anything with soyu cream is a must have and I must get some.",

    "text": "Ate here for the first time last night and was impressed with the food. Although rather pricey, everything I tasted had great flavor and was a decent portion of food. I could not come up with a complaint about any of the menu items I tried, which is about as nice of a compliment as I can give a restaurant. While everything passed the taste test, nothing I ate knocked my socks off and made me want to come back ASAP.  Aside from the food, the staff were friendly, the restaurant looked beautiful and our wine was half off due to happy hour. I was impressed with nearly everything about this restaurant and had a nice time dining here.  So why the 3 star review? Everything seemed to cost $5 more than I would have liked to pay. Yes the food is good, but not THAT good. $10 for 5 above average pot stickers is not something I can see myself paying on a regular basis.  All in all, this restaurant has pretty tasty food and provides a nice environment for a fun night out. If you are dining on a budget, you should probably seek another establishment.",

During my last visit, I tried to mix up the variety a bit, and my dad ordered the hawaiian ribeye and my sister and I shared a lobster and truffle mac and cheese. I think the mac and cheese was yum! Do expect it to be filling, but finding nice lobster chunks that evens out the pasta ratio is a big plus! The ribeye was good. It had a big pineapple slice that the ribeye sits on. The season was a decent taste as well.   Service was kind of disappointing being that it wasn't busy at all at the dining area, but our server Justen managed to rarely check up on us, and then after flagging him down for refills, forgot that we requested refills.",

    "text": "For National Boss day, or whatever the official name is, my co-workers and I decided we were going to suck up a little bit and take the one in charge to lunch. One of them suggested Kona Grill and what a suggestion it was. Although I did get a thorough look through the menu, I didn't have much choice as to what I was going to order as my co-worker kept raving about the Macadamia Crusted Chicken Breast. It was a flavorful delight and so moist and tender no knife was necessary. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were just as good and bursting with flavor. I added a house salad to my meal which was served with an outstanding vinegrette dressing and crumbled bleu cheese. The server was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks were never empty and she kept pretty good tabs on us, making sure that everything was satisfactory. I am definitely going to have to make a return trip to try the sushi. Three of us added salads to our meal which brought the total to just under ninety bucks. That may be a little on the high side for a non-alcoholic lunch, but it was a high class lunch in an elegant setting and worth every penny. It didn't put off a great \"family\" vibe and would not be some place I would expect a family to dine, especially if the kids are younger. Save the money and get the kids a happy meal. This is, however, a perfect place for date night and is located just steps away from Total Wine and More. Bonus! I can see many happy return trips in my future.",

So, we haven't been there since they remodeled.  Gorgeous interiors!! Still trusting it was the same Kona as always we ordered our usual appetizers and drinks for happy hour.  Moscow mules were our drink of choice for the entire table.. 17 drinks total, and three dishes.  4 people.  We asked for the bill and were shocked by a couple of things.. First, there was no buzz at all.  Those Moscow mules didn't hit any of us.  ????? Very curious.. But hey ok, we had a great conversation and it's a beautiful atmosphere.  Still, where was our buzz? 2nd.. The bill $180!! Each of our happy hour drinks were $8.00!!!!! What????? and literally no buzz for anyone.  This was shocking to each of us.  So, in one fell swoop our great appreciation for Kona Grill fell, and we all felt- we can't return here because the cost $$$$$$ there was literally no liquor in our mules at all.. Just not worth it.  Bye Kona.",

But as I've gotten to know a lot more of Vegas I'v realized this place isn't on par with some of the great restaurants around town. I've mostly only come here for happy hour. They've got a great outside patio, if you get here early enough to get a seat. They have some good food too but they love to over stuff all their sushi with crab coleslaw. So your really just getting a big ball of rice, with crab slaw and a tiny piece of fish on it. Extremely disappointing if you have an appreciation for good Sushi. But they do have a lot more than sushi to choose from and most of it is decent. The drinks are good and reasonably priced during happy hour.",

So before you make comments about that statement, yes i did something for her that was kind of for me also. Anyways I headed over to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> and aha they had reservations and they offer flowers to the table.... Nice touch.   We arrived at Kona and the place was packed.. We checked in and the hostess let me know it would be just a few minutes for our table and that was it. 2 minutes Later we were on our way to the table. The waiter was quick and brought us waters and greeted us with a happy mothers day shout out to Becky. Nice touch #2   We ordered our daughters food when we ordered our Calamari appetizer and they came out at the same time... This is perfect and exactly why we do that. The waiter then took our orders and let us know that for moms there was a drink special... $2 bubblers  \" Champagne Cocktails\"  so it was taken advantage of. We ordered the macadamia nut crusted chicken and the macadamia nut crusted chicken tacos. Both meals were nothing less than amazing. Mr. Waiter also asked right off the bat if we would like any extra sauces... Nice touch #3  As we were finishing up the delectable meal he came back and said, \" by the way, you have a red velvet cupcake coming as well for free for mothers day\"  Nice touch #4. This thing was amazing, first off she loves red velvet cake and I love cream cheese frosting, so they pleased 2 eaters with one cupcake.   I say Yes to Kona Grill. The food was amazing the service was prompt and precise, and they really did do the \"extras\" to make it a special mothers day. In my opinion I say try this place out and see if it something that is for you!",

When I bought my house in Summerlin, I drew a triangle between Kona Grill, downtown, and Steiner's, and I had to find a house in that triangle as I was working downtown and enjoyed frequenting Kona Grill and Steiner's.  That was 5 years ago, though.  Unfortunately Steiner's died down, and Kona cut back their hours.  I believe they used to be open until 2am on weeknights, and now they're closed by 11pm.  Kona does have a regular and late night happy hour, and there's plenty to pick from, so thumbs up for that.  Just don't trust their web site for the happy hour times... call first.  Food is good, atmosphere is good, service is good.  Make sure you get Channelle as your server.  Really don't have too much bad to say about this place.",

    "text": "2 words.. Happy Hour. Kona grills happy hour menu is one of best, calamari is a must and the rock shrimp and chicken lettuce wraps are a no brainer. At 6$ each your your fill, which is rare considering most happy hours leave you hungry and dissatisfied until you end up paying the price of a regular entree to get full. Kona is the complete opposite though, these 2 appetizers were enough to feed me and 1 other, and I can eat! If you really wanna test your stomach though and pass out, some other hh menu items to consider are their flat breads, and the ahi crisp (my favorite) but the ahi crisps are little bit smaller. The place gets packed pretty often but finding a seat is usually still pretty easy on the outdoor patio and the host is usually pretty spot on with their service every time I've been here. When ever I'm looking for a cheap meal on happy hour times, this is one of first places I suggest.",

You should open another spot closer to the southeast side.  Their flat bread pizzas are some of the best the fiance says he has ever had and this is from a guy who hates anything approaching thin crust status on a pizza.  All their sushi rolls are definitely above the usual happy hour par and their sashimi style sushi is actually really good too.  The only thing I've ever had there and not cared for was the calamari.  If you want a fair priced happy hour drink they have some good options including their martinis and cosmos.  I personally love their selection of skinny drinks.    As others have mentioned the bar and patio can get very crowded and sometimes table service isn't the fastest however, people if you're their for happy hour, relax!!  It's about the experience or just order your drinks two at a time :)",

I've actually been going there 10 years, and seen the place steadily decline.   It's become a lot more of a corporate run, and the quality of the food reflects it.   Skip the Sushi Bar, there are so many other better places in town for Sushi.  Their lunch menu for Hamburgers and Sandwiches are good.   Salads are okay, if you don't mind bagged lettuce. Don't ask them to make anything special or different. Corporate doesn't allow that.   Also, they do serve bread, only upon request, but the quality of the bread is such that you will want to take the loaf home, and use it for football practice.  If you have a favorite server here, don't get too attached. They have a very high turnover. Hostesses are snotty, because all the middle aged married men and all the single guys, who are desparate, hit on them, and give them \"swollen egos\".  Also, you will get exercise going there. Parking is always tough, and the front is reserved for \"leased\" exotic cars that belong to guys that are one paycheck away from bankrupcy, and need the cars to impress the Kardashian wantabees.",

The sushi has gone from good to kind of a mess.  It used to be my favorite thing to order, but now I try to avoid it.  The pizzas, and flat breads are a pretty safe bet.  They've always been well made.  The other appetizers are good too. The flavored cosmos are too sweet for me, and the margaritas aren't as good as they used to be.  There's always beer when all else fails.  Since the happy hour is at the bar, and on the patio only, parking, and finding a table can be difficult.  I usually avoid going there for happy hour when the weather is nice, because that means it will be nearly impossible to get a table.",

    "text": "Once upon a time there was a Princess who moved to Las Vegas (although she still had a part-time kingdom gig in New Jersey, the Garden State).  Along with all the blinding neon lights, she was blown away by a concept unheard of back East - the Reverse Happy Hour.  Soon she was happily scarfing down Ladies' Margaritas, pizza with goat cheese, and tacos unlike anything served in Mexican restaurants - big enough for a meal, accompanied by fried rice with fresh pineapple and shrimp, and for only 4.50 (okay, maybe 5 bucks tops) - at her favorite Happy Hour watering hole, Kona Grill.  Or was it the fabulous southwestern slaw?  The Princess was there so often, and had so many delectable and cheap dishes - and Ladies' Margaritas - that it's hard to remember what came with what.  But that was in the olden days, circa 2007. And a lot of that is gone.  First to go was the goat cheese on the pizza.  Then the garlic shrimp pizza.  The fried rice.  The slaw.  The onion rings to die for.  Gone, all gone.  The Happy Hour remains, though a ghost of its former self.  The margarita is the same, and only 50 cents more.  The 10\" pizza is still good, costs six bucks, but now only as a Pizza Margherita - with tomatoes, cheese and basil, BBQ chicken, or Pepperoni.  Not a bad deal, but not the pizza of blessed memory.  Tonight we managed to eat early enough to get to the first happy hour, before 7 pm.  Most of the patio heaters were working, and I had my Princess Cushion with me, to protect my Royal Behind from the hard, cold metal seat, so we were pretty comfortable.  My husband had a Blue Moon ($4, which I don't think is a great happy hour price any more).  I had the margarita, of course.  We shared the tomato pizza, which had a good amount of cherry tomato halves and shredded fresh basil, and also an order of Romaine Wraps, with chicken and shrimp in a mildly spiced sauce.  That was really tasty.  If I didn't yearn for the Kona Happy Hour of yore, I might have given this a higher rating.  What you get is still very good, and so is the service, which includes a last call for Happy Hour.  But it's hard to forget the glory that was Kona.  Maybe when the economy comes back, the goat cheese will, too.  I can only hope.  And then I will live Happily Ever After.  The End",

After graduation a group of family and friend (16 of us) went to the Kona Grill for lunch Grandson's graduation , family and friends (16 of us)  I had the Big Kahuna cheese burger and it was the best burgerI I have ever had.  My son had the Kona chopped salad . We continued to go there often. I moved to Las Vegas last winter and was anxious for the re-opening.  Yesterday was my son's birthday and I wanted to take to lunch.  He ordered the Kona chopped salad and it was one-half the size--I ordered the burger  it had NO flavor--the onions were not carmelized they were grilled absolutely NO flavor",

Great place to go bring work people or even have a work lunch if you need it. It's inside a little shopping center in Boca Park, a part of the Summerlin suburb in Vegas. Summerlin is not a city. Are you from Summerlin? You're the only one who thinks it's a city. Prices are pretty fair here. They are very quick, friendly, and helpful. For the cost, you're getting some upscale treatment. Grab a rainbow roll and enjoy!",

    "text": "We arrived and were promptly seated. We were greeted by our server but she never introduced herself throughout the entire experience. She seemed pleasant enough and warmly asked us what we would like to drink. She left and got our drinks and then returned with a root beer and a sierra mist with no ice for my fiance. My fiance let her know it was out of syrup and she apologized and quickly grabbed another. Note: We are both servers in town so we extraordinarily understanding of service type things because we do it for a living. We put in a order for two of the flat breads and our server disappeared and returned soon after with our share plates. Seems great, right? I thought so, up to that point. She came back and took our order, a burger medium well for my fiance with an extra side of mushrooms and onion straws so she could add them herself and a order of sweet potato fries. As for me I ordered three sushi rolls: a Caterpillar Roll, a Wave Roll, and a Soft Shell Crab Roll. We received our two flat breads relatively fast and were excited to try the new one we'd never had before. We already loved the Margarita one and were looking forward to trying the veggie one. My fiance mentioned to me that we needed salt and napkins. I looked around and saw our server talking to the booths next to us for quite a while each time. Again, understandable. We are servers also and understand some tables are more demanding or maybe they are just friendly. We waited for about 5 minutes until finally I caught her as she was walking by our table and asked for the salt and napkins. If I had not stopped her she would've been gone and I know this because I caught her at the end of the booth almost past us without her checking on us. She finally returned with our napkins and salt around 10 minutes later. I salted my flat bread and dug in. As usual it was tasty and my fiance really enjoyed the steak one that she got minus the bleu cheese. I started to run low on my bottled root beer and again I looked for our server and she was either nowhere to be found or she was talking to another table for like 3 plus minutes. This wouldn't bother me but she never once in our entire dinner did the same with us. We were treated as second thoughts and this was reinforced by our entire experience. My root beer finally ran out and I was starting to get annoyed. I set it to the end of the table next to the glass with just ice and watched her talk to yet another table for about 4 minutes. Finally she walked by and noticed my drink and asked us if we wanted refills. I ordered two root beers this time around because my pet peeve is to not have a drink while I am eating and I predicted I wouldn't easily get another root beer if I ordered just one. She brought these out and we went about eating our starters. We decided to behave ourselves because we had lots of great food coming and didn't want to fill up on the flat breads and that's when my fiance first noticed her burger sitting in the window. We could see because our booth was pointed straight to the kitchen. I took out my clock and marked the time, 7:24pm. The food and burger didn't actually get delivered to us until 7:32. Her burger just sat up there dying in the window. When our food was finally delivered they dropped the burger, fries, and the extra side of sauce that comes with the sweet fries and the server explained it was great. As for my food they plopped down the plates in front of me without ever identifying which rolls were which and then left. My fiance asked for some ketchup and mayo and the server returned with it rather quickly. My fiance was blown away by the size of the burger and despite being in the window for such a long time she said it was tasty. She did notice that the grilled onions that are supposed to come on the burger were not there but made peace with it. Our server did check back on us a few minutes after we began eating and asked us how everything was. This was the only time she came and checked on us until we were almost finished. Note: My fiance didn't know the grilled onions were missing until after this check back. We both enjoyed our food and watched what was going on around us as service industry people do. We both commented on how every single other table she had got loads of attention except us. Maybe she looked at us and thought, young, two top or maybe something else. In some way or form we were marked as being not worth while. We finished up and literally stacked our plates and silverware together so she would get the hint that we were finished and in her industry. She grabbed the stuff and came back a few minutes later. We got a dessert to go and our check. We liked the food and will return again in the future but we will never have this server again. I have referred to her as our server because until we got our bill and saw she had no name she told us. Our server's name was Hayley. Our entire experience was ruined by us being overlooked and ignored.",

He basically said no and and said we could sit outside on the patio. When I asked    If there was shade or misters he said he didn't know \"cause I haven't been out there\" and turned to walk away with a \"have a nice day\".  Disrespectful jerk!

My fiance strayed from his norm of Salmon which Kona does expertly and tried the Chopped Salad w/Macadamia Nut Chicken pieces in it. He didn't care for it, but I am sure it was great.  The ambiance at Kona is awesome! Great atmosphere for a date or the family. The decor is very pleasant.  The reason this is not a 5 star review, because I have to tell you we LOVE this place, is because the service, rather our server was awful. She would have bludgeoned us both if looks and attitude could kill. We ordered, she seemed very displeased that we did not want wine, copped an attitude and walked away. Just like that. When she brought the food it was the same. I asked her for two to-go boxes as we were finishing up and she snapped \"I have to box them for you!\" The entire dining experience was uncomfortable due to her downright hostility. I don't know if she hates her job or if she is just having a bad day. I really hope it is the latter which is why I won't post her name. (I like to believe that in the service industry you don't really get to behave that way for very long.)  I hope her day gets better and Heaven help anyone else that she serves tonight.",

The place was pretty busy and we were still able to find a seat outside. It was a nice, cool day so being outside wasn't torturous.   Started off with White Sake Sangria ($6.50) which was the best sake infused sangria I have ever had. I've had a few sake sangrias before where the sake overpowered the drink but this one was the perfect blend. Also got a Margarita on the rocks ($4.75).  For foods: Cheeseburger Sliders ($6)- I thought were pretty tasteful. Got it as medium which was cooked perfect. One thing that was different was they put cucumbers instead of pickles which I loved because I loath pickles! Good amount for the price.  Avocado Egg Rolls-(half off about $5)- I am a avocado lover so this was heaven in my mouth. It came with a honey cilantro dipping sauce. yum!  Shrimp & Chicken Wraps- ($6)- Lots of flavors in your mouth. i really liked it. The portion was just right. The right amount of lettuce and comes with a cucumber salad which was pretty delish.  Philly Roll (half off about $3)- Sushi wasn't too good. The ratio of rice was pretty off. Not enough fish in it. If you want to eat sushi, I suggest to go somewhere else for it.  Service was good. Natalie came by and checked on us at the right times. Food came out in a reasonable time. Our table was a little sticky but other than that I will probably be back again.",

When we ordered the server didn't take everyone's order before he left the table. The food was okay, but way too pricey for \"happy hour\" . Literally the worst experience ever for the price I paid. Server brought our check with the food practically, and we felt very kicked out. Overall not satisfied, and disappointed we chose this place to celebrate a birthday. Would not recommend to friends!",

    "text": "I had appetizers and drinks with my friend here on Saturday evening, and the service was ok at first.   I've been here a few times before the remodel, but never really liked it much each time. The food wasn't all that great and the service lacked. However, I told my friend I wanted to try it again and sit upstairs since I've never been and my friend has never  been to Kona Grill period. So I was pretty excited to be seated upstairs.   When I arrived a few minutes late after my friend got us a table, the server checked my ID and got my drink order on the way. The first few seconds of meeting her weren't personable. It was a real quick exchange of can I see your ID and then she walked off. No greet or anything.   We received our drinks, neither one of us was ready to order, so she gave us a few more minutes. Came back, I was ready to order, but my friend wasn't, so she said ok let me know whenever you're ready as she quickly walked off. Not even taking my order.   All in all, the new server who took over since the original one was leaving, she did a wonderful job. On top of our drinks and asked if we needed anything every now and then. Very attentive. I did tell our new server what happened and then the manager got involved. I don't mean to get anyone in trouble, but this place has to really step up their service game. It's a shame because it is a nice venue, but it's never on the top of my list of places to go. And it's so close to my house.",

    "text": "Sad to say I wasnt impressed at all. Really bummed out because we would come here every Sunday just about since they closed for remodeling and we would partake in the great happy hour deals. Sure the new decor is beautiful and contemporary and the choice of music is in good taste. I was so excited to go here since its remodeled new opening and so we went on a Sunday. I knew it was gunna be packed seeing as how its happy hour I made a reservation for 130 pm.   Upon my arrival the 3 girls in the front looked at me like I had 10 heads when I said I had a reservation. There was almost no where to sit literally the place was nearly at full capacity. Finally found a table, and sat down. It took literally 15 minutes to even have the server come over and get us our water. I remained patient as they were slammed and this was the first Sunday since their reopening. It took another half hour to get 4 avocado rolls at which time I finally got the iced tea I initially ordered with my water. Our server said \"the tea is in the back\"  The entire time the server was cold, quite standoff-ish, just not friendly. Hardly seen the server the entire dining experience. Seemed like she had an attitude. No apologies for anything coming out late or her being gone half the time. Ok I get it your busy but come on at least acknowledge your patrons. The food finally came out. The kids meal grilled cheese waa a joke. Fries were overcooked and hard and the sandwich, well lets just say I wish I woulda got a pic of that. I was too busy taking a pic of something else ...   My lunch sandwich was fine until I nearly choked and cracked my tooth on a bone from the chicken. Talk about feeling absolutely disgusted. When I tell the server about what happens she has the nerve to ask me \"is that a bone??\" I had to bite my tongue with the response I had. Thankfully the manager rushed over and apologized and took it off the bill.  As a kona grill veteran I still dont like how u have to be outside or the bar to get happy hour deals. As full as the place was, everyone should be accommodated with that happy hour deal.   Even after all this, I would probably give kona grill at least another shot. Just wont be for quite a while. *sigh.",

    "text": "So it's been 3 years since my last review, so I thought I'd update it! Well, the renovation that they did to Kona Grill is nice! However it seems since the renovation also out went their customer service. The last 2x I've been here I've been pretty disappointed with the lack of attentiveness and really the sense of urgency.   Most recent, we were sat outside and it was just a little chilly and there was a dirty table that we asked if we could sit at. Our waitress Taylor seated us and told us that she would have someone clean it right away, some minutes later another waiter sat other guests at the table and cleaned it right away for them... Fine. So then I decided to order some sushi and my boyfriend ordered a burger. I then asked for sake with my dinner. My entrees came out well before his burger and I ended up finishing my dinner before my sake and his burger arrived. The Sushi roll was just ok. Our waitress hadn't checked on us for some time so I headed to the bathroom and caught my waitress midway and told her to cancel the sake order. She made an excuse saying the first sake wasn't made hot enough. But I'm pretty sure she let it sit on the bar counter so it got cold. For the rest of the evening she just checked on us 1 or 2x more. She apologized for the sake and we got our check and paid the bill before she could leave again, not wanting to wait on her.    Anyway, it was just a very poor encounter and I used to really enjoy Kona Grill, next time I'll just take my boyfriend's first suggestion and go to In N Out instead. Better service and 70% cheaper.",

It's about $30.  The best thing on the menu for meat-eaters is the pork chop... not something I would usually order in a restaurant but here... it's a yes.  I love onion rings but they don't love me but if you eat at Kona Grill you are likely to see a large stack of onion rings go by.  I've tasted one and it was yummy.   On the appetizer menu of things I can eat I particularly like the avocado egg rolls.  The bar seems kind of like a pick-up joint but I enjoy the restaurant quite a bit and service is always good and a booth is almost always available.",

I had the Pad Thai, ahi appetizer and a gin and tonic, simple order.    We sat inside but mgmt did give us the happy hour prices which was appreciated.  I definitely will return but with a much smaller party.",

It's also very nice and relaxing up there on the rooftop.  My last experience was really upsetting.  My table all got our food items at different times.  I e one entree came out, then an app, then another persons entree, then 10 mins later the other entrees. There were 6 of us, not a crazy big party.  We never received the avocado egg rolls that I ordered as an appetizer. I would have totally understood if they notified us that they were out but instead they kept saying it was in its way when I would repeatedly ask.  Long story short, they kept promising the food was on its way but 2 food items never came.  Our server apologized that it was taking a long time and reassured us we wouldn't be charged for the food we never received.  They also gave us a free dessert that was absolutely disgusting lol. It was a brownie sundae thing that was with very stale brownies. Maybe if we sat inside we would have had a better experience? And pass on dessert",

Went with my girlfriends for lunch, lots of options and of course sushi.  We tried a lot of things and everything was excellent. Caribbean queso dip - crispy deep fried cornbread with habanero queso, was good but queso lacked heat.  Chopped salad and oriental salad were both nice. I like that you can do a side salad option for $6 instead of getting entree portion. Avocado egg rolls - as long as you don't compare them with the ones at Cheesecake Factory, you will love these! The egg rolls are place atop a bed of crunchy cabbage, carrot salad that had a light and yummy vinaigrette. Mushroom flatbread- excellent, plenty of mushrooms and the crispy filo topping was nice. Vegetarian sushi - this was nicely prepared, they substituted soy paper for no extra charge.  Chocolate butter cake - this was to die for!! It was served warm with salted caramel drizzle and whipped topping with slivered almonds.  Service was excellent, from our server to hostess and water boys, all were great",

Family of four, we paid almost $70 and it didn't even fill us up (see following statement).  -1 star for the portions. My $14 spider roll consisted of only 6 3/4\" pieces (I may be being a bit generous here). I bought two rolls, and my 8 year old daughter bought two rolls and neither of us had enough food to feel satisfied.   -1 star for the flavor. Honestly, the food was bland; there's no other way to say it. The only flavorful part of the meal was my son's cheeseburger which was so burnt that I was able to taste the charred remains of the cow it was made from. A $70 meal should tantalize the taste buds and please the senses.   Sadly we won't be back, there are far better places to get sushi in Vegas.",

The dishes arrived all within 15 minutes of arriving  at the venue in the following order: dumplings, lettuce cups, Kona fillet, Philadelphia rolls then sashimi. Dishes where served around 3/4 minutes apart despite barely making a start in the first.  The fillet was completely rare and sent back for medium rare as per the order. The same piece then returned close to well done. Rather than trying to graze and enjoy meals we felt rushed so food didn't go stone cold etc given everything was served at once.  Service was also average no questions or do you need help with the menu etc. For such an extravagant fit out and location we left bitterly disappointed",

Ten minutes later a girl comes out and seats in a not very crowded restaurant at all. With about maybe 15 empty tables. We only ordered only three things off the menu. 35 minutes later and there is still no food. I go back up to the front of the restaurant looking for the manager, still no hostess at the front. I wait about maybe 10 more minutes until this lady comes out, I didn't even know she worked there because she was wearing regular clothes. I told her my concern and she gave me an attitude about how she just dropped off the food a second ago. That's still about 40 min for three plates. She doesn't even apologize for the wait and gives me look as I walk away. Only thing that saved this dinner was the miso sea bass. Not worth it though. Will not be coming back.",

Beer is good and the California Rolls were always \"spot on\".  The experience today left me a bit perplexed.  I debated writing an experience response on Yelp.  I truly feel this website can have positive and negative effect for a business.  For that I am very shy about giving a negative response.  I want to start off first by saying that we still enjoy Kona Grill.  I would recommend everyone to experience it. If nothing else to just people watch.  Great atmosphere and the food is always over the top good.  I am and have been in the food service industry.  I have been for over 20 years.  Usually fine and casual dining.  The reason I mention this is because I am understanding and never complain.  I have walked in the shoes of the food servers.  We all have bad days.  What happened already!  Well here it is.  We were greeted very respectfully and professionally by the host.  They did not have any downstairs outdoor seating.  They gave us directions for their upstairs outdoor section.  I loved it.  We sat at a table and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  We were seated for 10 minutes without even a hello or a head nod.  I decided to greet the bartender.  She was cordial and helpful.  She directed what appeared to be the only waitress on staff upstairs.  She visited 5 minutes later.  Very short without as much as a smile.  We placed our drink order.  Glass of beer, glass of Chardonnay and an ice tea.  She asked it we wanted sweetener for the tea.  We said yes, Sweet and Low.  We waited and we waited.  Finally the drinks arrive by a different waitress.  So there was more than one.  This waitress took our for our waitress.  Finally our waitress arrived.  Still no sweet and low.  Again very short and not even making eye contact.  What is this about.   I addressed the bartender for the sweet and low along silverware.  She provided them for us and apologized for the poor service from our waitress.  I said that is okay.  I know sometimes we get busy.  Oh let me mention.  They were not fully seated busy.  After the bartender left the manager came to our table.  Nice gentleman.  He apologized.  I explained that was okay.  I know we get busy and I don't want this to reflect negatively on your server.  The food arrived and as usual it was awesome.  After the manager left the table the waitress finally returns again with very little enthusiasm or eye contact.  She never asked to refill our drinks or even ask for desert.  As she came by one last time to clear the plates, I asked for the bill.  I truly felt like a second class citizen with the service.  I am not certain if the server had a bad day or just had a bad table.  That happens.  I don't ask for over the top service, but I do expect service as you would every table.  I truly debated writing a review.  In fact this is the first I have ever done for a restaurant.  I do not want anyone to get in trouble.  I want the same service as the table next to me.  I will still return to the restaurant.  I will still enjoy the best happy hour in town.  I feel this post will help in training and improve service and experience for the customers.  I still highly recommend the Kona Grill.  Great atmosphere.",

The service was very good and very helpful.  I ordered the chicken and broccoli stir fry. It was really good!!! I split the dish with my boyfriend who ordered the special fish which was swordfish that day. Both were delicious and the fish was prepared very well. Also the happy hour is great and has a lot of good sushi rolls on it for half the prices.",

Our waiter was awesome and friendly and recommended the dishes we ordered. Started with the calamari- yum! For dinner had the miso sea bass (melt in your mouth amazing flavor) the chicken stir fry (just right spicy and tender) and the pesto pasta (perfect texture and flavor with a little kick). Shared the passion fruit creme brulee and practically licked the dish clean. Left with happy tummies. We'll for sure be back - a lot!",

Do you like ok service, too? Because that's what I feel I got here.   I ordered sushi and water on my last trip here. It was good, sure, but not GREAT. It wasn't the kind of meal I was expecting when friends suggested this place had some of the best sushi in town, and definitely not competitive with Ichiza or Yama or Kaya. Not even close. My date ordered a salad, and she seemed pretty happy with it. From where I was sitting, it looked like the salads that they serve at Wendy's, except this time I'm paying more than $5 for it. Grumble grumble...  All in all, I'm sure I'll come here. This is one of those places where the cool kids hang out, and I like the atmosphere here. Except maybe next time I come, I'll grab a bite before hand and just enjoy a beer here.",

Grab a cheap, light lunch here between stops browsing the shops in Boca Fashion Village with some friends.   HH eats menu has several sushi rolls half-off and a list of others priced at $6/each- opted for the BAMA ROLL (crab mix, cream cheese, jalapeno, tuna, avocado, soy paper, spicy motoyaki sauce), which I enjoyed and the VOODOO ROLL (spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe), which was both falling apart and had unbalanced flavors.  Would come back with a group to try more of the HH menu, but the sushi options here seem to be hit or miss based on this and vague prior visits- nothing in particular stands out. The macadamia nut chicken is a tasty dish if you're in the mood for a non-seafood entree.  Interior is a little swanky, seating available at the sushi bar, alcohol bar, or patio, as well as regular indoor seating. Service is friendly and dishes have nice presentation. Not sure I'd return outside of HH times though.",

Since I hadn't been here before I ordered the lettuce wraps and Philly roll thinking they'd be on the smaller side; they were not.  The lettuce wraps were a perfect combination of sweet and savory and the Philly roll wasn't bad either.  I also had two Sangrias trying the sparkling and the red and both were tasty.     My water glass was never empty long and I was quickly asked if I wanted anything else once my Sangrias got low.  My bill was waiting for me in a glass at the bar and once I pulled out my card it was quickly taken care of.  I couldn't really find any fault with my dinner and look forward to trying them again.",

There are other parties sitting at the other tables on the patio and inside is very busy. Understanding that it was busy we didn't say anything when 10 minutes rolled by and not 1 server came to our table with menus, water, nothing. 20 minutes later I had to go ask for a manager. Erika came to our table apologized gave us menus and and took our order. My lemonade came and tasted like water and so did my sisters so I knew it wasn't just me. Now a new sever came over and stated she will be helping us and she heard front the manager we had been waiting for a while and the manager was going to comp a dessert for the wait.   Fast forward, my fries were cold, cheeseburger off the happy hour meal was good and hot, husband enjoyed his crab crunch and everyone else was happy with their food.   The spicy shrimp tempura was not enjoyable and was not what I expected. I was thinking they would be fried deeper with dipping sauce on the side.   Ok so now the server comes around again and asked if we needed anything else, we say no she says she will get the bill and it took her 10 minutes to come back.   There was no comp on the meal, no 10% off for our inconvenience, nothing! And what happen to them offering dessert from the manager? I have been to Kona many times and always had an enjoyable experience but I will not be back.",

    "text": "Went there with friends the meal was nice but I ordered my go to drink - a midori sour, it was all midori and no sour apple pucker, I asked the waitress if the bartender could put more sour apple pucker in it so the drink can be right, she told me the midori liquor is a melon liquor...duh. This is my favorite drink and I know how to make them myself, the ones I make are better and I didn't ask for a liquor tutorial I asked for my drink to be made correctly, it's not supposed to taste like a melon.    The waitress brought me back a taller drink that still tasted like the melon midori liquor. So instead of a midori Sour I got a melon drink. The bartender didn't know how to make it obviously and that's my favorite drink. If I go to this location I know not to order any mixed drinks because it won't be made correctly. I've included the pictures of My midori liquor from home with the sour apple pucker. This is how it's supposed to be made not the fruity tutti crap they gave me.",

Drink orders were very very slow to get started as there were a ton of people here around 6 pm. I think we waited about 15 minutes for our initial drinks. However, after that, our waitress, Nicole, was on point and making moves! The rest of our food and drink orders were very prompt.  Happy hour appetizers were wonderful! I got the lettuce wraps, which were sooo delicious. We had a great time sharing dishes and enjoying our white sangrias!  The atmosphere was great for after work. I will definitely be coming back!",

I don't think the server understood English all that well, although she was nice.  When I mentioned this was where our first date, she just sort of nodded her head and smiled.  Within  a few minutes of giving her the order, my husband asked if he could change his Carribean Crab sandwich to something else, and the server stated, she couldn't change it, which I'm sure if my husband asked to talk to management, a manager would have cancelled it.  We are not pushy people who complain so we just let it go.  Sushi was pretty good, restaurant always looks spectacular, and we will be back for sure, because it was our first date place.",

Very poor staff attention, food ( old, frozen and inedible chicken parts were a horror) when we mentioned this to the server she didn't offer to present another plate nor did she mention it to the manager so that our needs could be met. Not good at all!! Not an acceptable restaurant practice.  Portions are also decreased in size, prices have gone up not in accordance to the fare and dining experience,  individual waitress attention is very poor (table was not cleared after our dinner) and then, to top it off, we were charged for an extra drink that we didn't order. When we pointed this out to our waitress, she said well ok, and then charged us anyway. The once huge sushi rolls are now the size of a nickel and mostly filled with rice. All in all, this is not the Kona we loved for 12 years.  Seems like once they \"upgraded\" they also upgraded the cost and the selections offered, especially on Happy Hour (as noted by many). One waiter mentioned that \"we are trying to get people back\"....not working at all.  Kona also shortened their Happy Hours as well as, closing earlier every day! Things must be bad. Not ever going back!",

A bowl of Miso Soup was tasty, and a small Oriental Salad filling.  A well-prepared Rainbow Roll was excellent, and so was Shrimp & Pork-Fried Rice to go with the ever enjoyable entree of moist Miso-Sake Marinated Baked Seabass.  A taste of grilled Ono with Mango Salsa also proved to be moist and delicious.    I washed down my meal with hot Organic Sweet Chamonile Citrus Tea in a cast iron pot, while Diane enjoyed glasses of hard to find IBC Root Beer.  Service was very good except for late transport of the Fried Rice.  Our friends, who had lived for years in Hawaii, greatly enjoyed their dessert of Passion Fruit Creme Brulee (Lilikoi).  This place has proven to be consistently very good through the years, and will continue to be on my list of stalwart restaurants to which I will periodically return.",

But there was some cleaning fluid smell emanating either from the floor or table.  Couldn't tell.  Anyways, this place is always packed so I'm assuming there must be some good things here to order.

We ate as much sushi as we could fit in our big mouths lol - started with a big ol' Rainbow roll, holy cow the fish is so fresh. The tuna pieces were my favorite. Next was the Las Vegas roll, the Picasso (crap the jalapenos on top were fresh and HOT, so be careful!), and last but not least the spicy yellowtail roll. Oh I love their yellowtail.   My friend ordered some chicken chili which he devoured, and calamari for the table to share. The calamari was hot, tender and delicious. All food came out pretty quick considering how busy they were.   Love the ambiance in this place, always so classy. The bathrooms are spacious and clean. They have a happy hour which we missed on this evening but I think it goes until 6 or 7.",

    "text": "Kona is popular for their happy hour specials and the all day Happy Hour Sundays are when I mostly visit..  Kona Service and ambiance:  Kona went through a major remodel back in 2017 (I believe?) and the new contemporary decor on both floors looks great.  Attractive pendant lighting, brand new furniture and plenty of flat screens makes it a great place to watch sports.  Our server was trying her best but I think she was stretched out too thin over multiple tables.  She wasn't getting help from the Sushi chefs and bar either. We ordered some basic rolls and our server gave us a heads up that it might take up to 45 minutes for them to come out?   Fortunately they were out in about 20 minutes.   The bar took forever to get our drinks to our server during our visit.  Twice, we ended up just walking to the bar and ordering the drinks our self.  Kona Happy Hour Menu:  I'm a big fan of the lettuce wraps as they're always fresh and you get a generous serving of chicken.  Al the flatbread pizzas I've ordered through my visits have been tasty and large in portion.  The sushi rolls are average for a non-sushi restaurant but take awhile to get to your table.  The Sliders are large size for sliders and are tasty and cooked pretty well.  A small sake bottle and large kirin light for $7 is my go to Happy Hour drink order.  Service at the tables in the restaurant is inconsistent at best but the servers are friendly.  Your best bet: sit at the bar and eat there.  Every time I've went this route, the food and orders were taken care off immediately.  See ya at the bar, Kampai! =)",

After considering other places for happy hour though, with most only til 6, we decided on Kona because of their longer (til 7) happy hour.  It was like old times, we looked at the menu of items, knew what we wanted instantly and ordered.  2 orders of pan fried pot stickers Avocado egg rolls 2 cheeseburger slider plates  A crab crunch sushi roll And a pepperoni flatbread  I ordered a sangria of some sort, it was pink and in a tall wine glass but very delicious.   Overall it was a home run happy hour, everyone enjoyed. The food was consistently good, presented nicely, service was great, price was fair, the renovations were much needed and made the place more open/spacious/bright. Great job Kona!!",

Wasn't sure why we sat for awhile without anyone coming by we were wondering if the server was told she had been sat in her section or not. We ordered a couple sushi rolls and some calamari. The rolls were eh- I've had better and just didn't wow us. The calamari was chewy and I wasn't a big fan but normally I love calamari. There were literally @6 huge tentacles not enough pieces we wanted to eat. Just left them all on the plate blah.  Overall I just wasn't hugely impressed and there are other places in Summerlin I will try instead. I wish we had a better experience bc it's so close but sort of disappointed.",

The salad was missing ingredients (bacon) and although my friend and I ordered the same thing, they were visually different. Outside of the modifications requested. Size was totally different.   Our waitress was sweet and did her best but the kitchen was an absolute disaster. The manager came over but really didn't make us feel any less upset with the situation.   We could hear the cooks yelling at each other or other staff members, the hostess and a waitress where in the bathroom discussing the disaster in the restaurant. Loudly and in front is us.   Honestly huge let down for a Mother's Day treat meal. Will never be back. Wouldn't trust it.   Our waitress was Ashlee and she was the only positive aspect of this day.",

For our drink order we had sodas, plus we asked for 2- waters with extra lemon.  We didn't get the extra lemon. We ordered sushi off of the happy hour menu. There weren't any pictures of the sushi, but there were descriptions. A runner brought out our order. After taking 1 bite and really looking at it, realized there may be something wrong. Another runner after a bit, brought out the actual sushi we ordered. The restaurant wasn't really busy for this type of issue to happen.  We also ordered sandwiches, burgers, and pulled pork sliders. Food was fair. However the Taro Chips were very good.   The waitress let us know the sushi belonged to another table after it sat at our table for some time. She took it away after she had given an explanation. The experience for my table wasn't a very friendly one. Maybe we came in on the wrong day.   The restaurant is very clean and modern in design. The location is very convenient Summerlin Pkwy/Rampart. Parking is fair.",

The chicken was perfectly cooked and they did package it seperate the which I appreciated but the salad had no red cabbage, no almonds and about 4 pieces of shredded carrot and one piece of a red onion in it. The lettuce in general was shriveled and not very fresh. The avocado egg rolls which are usually my favorite were brown and soggy. I do realize they could become soggy if packaged too early but it only took me 5 minutes to get to my destination so seeing that my $30 dinner was of such low quality was a real disappointment. This place used to be up to par in every area and so far the past year or so has been disappointing nearly every time. Hopefully they get some better oversight going.",

And if you are under 21 the ONLY place you can sit is at the sushi bar. I feel like it should only matter if you are 21 if you are sitting at an ACTUAL BAR. This is Kona GRILL not, Kona nightclub. Acting like this is Hakkasan or some shit. I'm 20 years old, I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm a child and need to be separated from other adults. I find this extremely ridiculous. Also it's nearly impossible to receive service. I sat for 10 minutes before a waiter even took my drink order. Our waiter wasn't even polite in the slightest. Every time I thanked him he couldn't even take the time to say you're welcome.The food is good and is the only reason I put up with everything. This is probably the reason I only come every once in awhile. My advice: appeal to EVERYONE, not just rich mid-life crisis summerlin old people that pretend to be young people. Also note that the price of happy hour has risen slightly.",

They changed a few of the recipes which turned out nice. The new pizzas are pretty decent and are more of a thin crust which I personally prefer. Its best to eat on the patio. Even on a hot day they have nice misters and fans that really keep you cool. The only problem is the outside of the patio has little bushes that attract bee's. So if you're sitting next to gates on the outside of the patio, beware.  I'm not a huge sushi lover so if I do have a hankering for it, I personally prefer to go somewhere that is known for having really good sushi, this place isn't but the other stuff they do have is pretty legit. Their clam chowder is some of the best i've eaten and almost always partake.",

Here's my latest and last experience: We walked in and the hostess was kneeling down below the reception counter. When she saw us, did she spring up? Of course, she stayed hidden until I finally asked if we could be seated. We went to the sushi counter. Did we get menus? No. Did we get chopsticks? No. Did we get napkins? No. Did anybody take our order? No. I finally \"interrupted\" the sushi chef to order. A simple order of tuni sashimi, tako and unagi. Did it ever arrive? No. I sat there while he made 4 other orders for those seated in the restaurant. When he started on another order, I interrupted and asked him if my order was in process? He looked at me blankly... He disappeared and returned with Tuna sashimi. I'm not sure where it came from and then tako. Unagi never made it to me. Sushi was average at best. I didn't bother ordering anything else. So many other better places! Go elsewhere....",

They are obviously frozen somewhere far away with little car in preparation.  I would return but my choices would be different...no pot stickers for sure.",

The Cuban sandwhich was outstanding. I do enjoy a good Cuban sandwhich, but they're rare to find around town or if found one that is better than I can make on my own. Nevertheless the food was again great today Sep16, 2015 approx 4.p.m., staff professional, resturant & mens restroom clean. It was great meeting a fellow Vet working here...great cook & went out of his way to personally serve our food so it wasn't \"dying\" in the window. One team Hooah!",

I think I've tried everything on the menu including the various sushi rolls, the sliders, calamari, flat bread pizzas and the lettuce wraps.  My drink of choice is the strawberry blended margarita.  My only complaint is it does get busy and if you're not early it becomes sort of a stalk your table situation but with a little patience you're sure to get a seat.  And they are one of the only places I know that does an all day Happy Hour on a Sunday.",

The sliders are GREAT. And the ahi tuna crisps.... Oh my GOD so good!!! I swear I get them every single time. The avocado egg rolls are a little heavy but fan-freaking-tastic.   I love all of the drinks on their happy hour specials-- especially their Cosmopolitan. They get it right every time (they must use Cointreau because it is GOOD)   You have to check out the happy hour if you haven't already... But get there early!!

They have a long list of happy hour food choices which is nice, not much for sushi aside from the standard, basic rolls, plus 3 \"special rolls\" which were certainly not three of their best.  We also had the avocado egg rolls, cheeseburger sliders, calamari and flatbread buffalo chicken pizza -- all wonderful choices!!  The patio is great -- people watching and car watching doesn't get any better!  The misters are an added plus in the summer heat.  It does fill up and people do hover when your check arrives, but it's still worth it!!  FYI -- I have taken the kids before, they are only allowed on the patio, not in the bar area.",

We ordered the ahi steak sandwich and the bbq chicken flat bread, both came out promptly and delicious! I'd definitely give that night 5stars.  We then saw a flyer for all day happy hour and football, so we went again today. It was a different vibe and service was not a attentive as the first time we were here. I don't think this place should even offer a happy hour with football, if 1. You can't hear any of the games, 2. There aren't enough tv's to enjoy all the games that Sunday has to offer. Also if you're encouraging football fans to come in, watch the games and have a good time, don't give them dirty looks when cheering on their teams.  The happy hour menu is decently priced with a couple good options. The avocado egg rolls are a must! And make sure that the dipping sauce is on the plate when you get it, cause when you ask for it the server said \"oh it wasn't on there?\" With a little attitude, if it was you think I'd ask for it? I used to be a server and before you bring any dish to a table you always make sure everything is on there correctly, especially if it's a normal dish that gets ordered multiple times a day. Also isn't it customary to offer waters to those who aren't having a drink?   Aside from the eggrolls, we ordered the calamari, bulgogi tacos and crab crunch roll. They were nothing special, I'd probably never order any of those again except the egg rolls.  For the experienced we got today, it averages out to be 3 stars for both visits.  We'll come back but never for a football Sunday.",

We sat outside, and despite being worried the misters were going to be overbearing it was pleasant. One thing that was not OK, was that all the outdoor tables have a VERY sticky finish on them. I kept my menu to rest my forearms on because it felt as if the table was covered in dried Coca-Cola.  The appetizers, we got the beef tacos, were AMAZING. They were served in a flakey, croissant-like shell that I'm still dreaming about.  I ordered a burger and my girlfriend ordered the chicken avocado sandwich. Both were good but nothing that would make them the greatest we've tried.  Service was below par. Our server was not very knowledgeable. She did not know if their sushi was made with fresh of farmed fish (all of their sushi is FARM fish), did not know what size patty came on the burger (they claim 12oz) and she failed to return often to check on us. My water class had a chip in it, when our food was delivered (by the manager for some reason - I hate it when they do this eg order with the waitress, but somebody else delivers?!) we asked for an extra serving of ketchup from the manager...who never returned only to be seen two tables away chatting with a young lady.  We will go back for the tacos, but that's about it...",

Not really my style. I typically like to sit in the dining room for my dinner. The table was small and we sat by the door where there was foot traffic. Not the restaurants fault, OURS! lol Very nice setting and atmosphere.   We started with Sangria. The red was better than sparkling for sure. The appetizers we had pot stickers, calamari and the tacos. i would seriously next time consider just coming here for appetizers and drinks. They were SOOOOO good. especially the tacos. I wouldn't change any of them.  For my main entree, i ordered the Lemon- Garlic Shrimp Pasta. My waiters recommendation. It was phenomenal. Very strong garlic flavor however. I don't mind. Garlic is awesome! My wife got the Macadamia nut chicken. I had a couple bites and i was jealous. Amazing flavor!! Shes very picky and didn't have one complaint.   The service was also very good. He was very nice and professional.   For 4 people the total bill was 105.45. We all ate an entree, 3 appetizers (happy hour), 3 sangria's, and 2 iced tea. Not bad at all for a nice evening with the in-laws!",

Their desserts are pretty big, I was surprised that their portions were as big as they were.  We ordered the butter cake and the ultimate fudge brownie. I am a huge chocolate lover and I actually enjoyed the butter cake more.  I felt that the brownie wasn't moist enough and kind of dry.    Service (4):  Great hostess and waitress.    Atmosphere (3.5): I feel like I am blind in there sometimes because I have a hard time reading the menu. However, the place is very simple and neat. They do have a bar and an outdoor seating area",

I went to Kona to meet up with a few friends and in the blazing heat of summer, I decided to sit outside amongst every table full of other patrons. I arrived alone and the host guided me outside to \"seat myself\" when I arrived I made eye contact with 4 servers who didn't appear very busy. 20 minutes later still not one server asked me if I even wanted a water. I then went up to the host and asked if she could send someone over. Very nicely. She said no problem they will be right over. Then the girls show up. I explained to them still no service I was parched. We gave them 10 more minutes and then asked the bartender to send someone. 10 minutes again. Still no menu, no waters, no service!!!!! They came from far and suggested Kona over many of others!! Never ever ever again! We got up and walked out!",

The staff is boring, the food is mediocre at best and the place is as disorganized as it comes.  They got lucky with a location and a patio.  Don't waste your time, explore Vegas.

When Tivoli Village was overrun by a BeerFest last weekend and we decided that Brio was not a good idea after all, my dinner date and I headed across the street and were seated immediately on the patio.   I've never had a problem with the food at Kona and this time was no different, ordering a small house salad and shrimp tempura roll.  However, choosing to sit on the patio was not such a great idea.  The music was too loud for conversation, the misters above our heads were dripping intermittently, and there were people smoking at the next table:  lesson learned.  Other than that, our server was very attentive and we had a great meal.  The End.",

It's definitely a place to gather in groups and perhaps to be seen at but not so much for the food.  Price is decent but I've been to other places where it's consider mom & pop shop and had better and price is reasonable.    I ordered the pad thai and was very disappointed on the (lack of) flavor and the drink wasn't too impressive as the description had it.  I really can't say much for this venue.  It would not be a venue I would want to host an event and may think twice about attending a hosted event by friends.  I will probably go if it's hosted and I don't have to pay for anything.  I know it sounds bad but again, I think it's the location of the place that makes the place but once again I was very disappointed on the food and semi-lack of service.",

When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were ignored by the hostesses, who asked us if we were there for happy hour& then instructed us to sit at the bar. They didn't point us in the right direction or (god forbid) show us where it was in the oddly situated restaurant, so we wandered past the host stand and sat at the sushi bar.   After we sat down we asked the sushi chef if happy hour was only at the sushi bar, and he said no, that it was also at the main bar and on the patio. The hostess could have told us this, or at least given us menus. We ended up ordering off the tiny happy hour menu that was already on the bar.  Our server took FOREVER to take our order, and even longer to bring our drinks. They looked semi-busy so I can overlook this, but I was missing a share plate and chopsticks for half the meal, which I had to ask for twice.   Apparently a lot of people ordered sushi, but there was no food runner, so at one point there were TWELVE plates of sushi up in the window and no one to take them to the tables. During this time at least seven people walked by and did nothing about it.   At least the food was ok (we ordered the ahi tuna crisps, the spicy tuna roll, the wave roll and the apple Brie flatbread) and the sushi chef kept checking on us.",

The sushi bar was vacant except for a lonely women in LBD.  My date didn't want me to flirt, so we sat inside the dark dining room.  Service was fine, no complaints, no problems, everything on the order correct.   I was buffeted out and wanted some good food.  My cheeseburger was perfect.  A large thick patty on a toasted bun with fully melted cheddar cheese.  They didn't put lettuce on the burger, which is just fine with me.  I rated this the best burger I ate this year.  My date had shrimp penne pasta which was plentiful and tasty. Pasta al dente, not mush.  The other diner had the pork steak and it was perfectly done. Very thick and flavorful cut of pork steak.  I'm surprised by the negative reviews here.  This is Kona Grill, with a laid back Hawaiian ambience.  This is now my favorite Las Vegas eatery.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Hawaiian influenced food style without the leis and hula skirts.  Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  I reserve those stars for a truly exceptional experience. This is a place to hang out once or twice a week.   Price normal to slightly high side, but not over the top.",

Ambiance is nice, staff was very accommodating ...and plus the food we ordered was worth the pay",

Even tho we showed up, restaurant cancelled reservation fee on Open Table since we sat at bar so I lost my 1000-point bonus. Service was very good, but food isn't. Tries to be Asian fusion, but basically expensive sushi knock off. Out of flat bread. Apparently they buy it from somewhere not realizing you can make it with flour water salt oil. Out of clams for 6 weeks due to poor quality from supplier. I cannot recommend this place other than for drinks.",

First off the remodel is great however I feel like much tables could be added when I went into the restaurant is was extremely busy and every table was taken. Even the bar and sushi bar was full. The host staff was not very helpful. There is clearly all new staff there including management. They should really work on who they hire because I continuously saw a lady manager being rude to her employees and even some tables. I sure wouldn't want to work for her it made us extremely uncomfortable. Besides that we finally found a table and enjoyed happy hour. I would have given this review 2 stars but it earned 3 since our server was very attentive.",

The tuna tower is incredibly tasty with just the perfect layers of crab,avocado,tuna and rice topped with an amazing sauce.

The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.  Since it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.  They have a special \"Pairing Menu\" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.  The food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!  My friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.  Will I return?  You bet, I want to try more of the new menu items.",

I've eaten here on multiple occasions,  and each time, the food, service, and cleanliness is worse than the previous. Because of the nice ambiance and reasonably priced happy hour, I attempt to justify returning again, but without fail, this restaurant continues to disappoint. Not only is the floor covered in food and trash, the placemats are LITERALLY STUCK to the tables. I only noticed this after the table was haphazardly wiped down by one of their disgruntled employees, and I went to flip my placemat that was crusted with food debris. Big mistake. After prying it loose from the table, I find that I was apparently looking at the \"clean\" side. This has occurred not only once, but three times total.   Needless to say that at this point, I will no longer return. If this is the way the front of the house is maintained, I can only imagine the numerous health code violations in the back of the house. Extremely disappointing for a venue with ample potential.   Oh, and the service- horrific.",

    "text": "Every month, a few Yelpers get together to meet up for a book club, and we try to go to different places each month, so that we can explore all the awesome food and coffee options available in the lovely Las Vegas area.  This past Sunday, we met at Kona Grill, per Stefany V's suggestion, for their all day happy hour!  Kona Grill is located in the Boca Park shopping center, directly across from (are you ready?) a Hipster Emporium.  Location aside, I was pretty impressed.  Happy Hour is ONLY available in the bar areas (sushi bar included) and the patio, not in the regular restaurant.  This was unfortunate, because it was HOT on Sunday.  We sat in the bar, which has AC, but its right next to the open patio area, so it doesn't really stay super cool.   Service was polite and friendly, from the hostesses, to the waiter who told me about the restriction on the HH seating, to our server.    Food was ok!  HH has a decent selection of sushi rolls, appetizers, and flatbreads, along with a few drink offerings, some for $6, some for half off.    I had a Bloody Mary (not on the HH menu, but only $7.50, and a pretty decent size),   From the HH menu, I ordered the crab crunch roll: crab mix, motoyaki sauce, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce.  This was half off for HH, so it was basically $3.75 for a really good sized roll.    I enjoyed this a lot.  I'm not a roll kind of girl...when I do sushi, I do nigiri, and I do AYCE.  Since this wasn't an option here, and the happy hour menu is limited, I picked the one that definitely didn't have avocado (allergy) that sounded good, and I really liked it.  As far as rolls go, I would definitely come back for this roll, and a few of them at that!  Potstickers: seared chicken & vegetable dumplings, asian slaw, traditional soy dipping sauce.  These were \"meh.\"  Too much dough, and it was very chewy.  The insides were a little bland.  I'd probably go with a flatbread next time instead.    The regular menu is a little pricey for me, especially with how much sushi I usually eat, so I don't know that I'll come here outside of HH, but I will definitely come back to try some more of the HH specials.",

It seems to be poor quality (and I'm sure that there will be some manager/chef rolling their eyes at this review- but it's honest and I'm not the only one who thinks this, I assure you). On a positive note, the avocado egg rolls are great and they have a nice bar and patio area.",

The sushi sampler is so much food for the price.  They also have all sorts of iced tea and a full bar, of course.

We asked to see the happy hour menu but Chris points some of the items out all over the place on the regular menu and said he'd come back with a happy hour menu but never did.   Two more pair join us at the bar, we were the first, and they get a server and way better server than us.  We sat at the bar with our shitty spicy tuna roll, and awesome tasting (but not on the happy hour) lobster mac and cheese, while the other party had about 8 plates, tons of drinks, filled water cups.  All I really wanted was to get a couple happy hour cocktail and try more happy hour items.  Water was never refilled and we only saw him twice, three with the check.  The first time was to take the order, second to drop the food, and finally to pay.  He took a couple of our items off the check but who gives a shit about that when good food, or absent food, is ruined by bad service.  I tipped the cost of the discounted items.",

We just went recently and the place is nowhere near as packed as it used to be, food became even more subpar to what it used to be, and forget about service. Happy hour, took a waitress 10+ minutes to get our drink order and the place was EMPTY. Drinks come, we ordered a bottle of sake.. she brought ONE cup. Food came by and now its 20 minutes late. Let me remind you the place is EMPTY and HH is from 9 to 10. Prices used to be 5 bucks, now 8.5.. its sad because the place looks good but everything else is just not up to par.",

I am very happy to report that this place is even BETTER now after its renovation, inside and out, complete with an addition of a bar/lounge on the 2nd fl terrace, accessible by stairs and elevator. The 2nd fl even has its own restroom.   RATING: 5 Star for its new renovation; excellent food/drink offers, friendly and efficient service!  :-)   Go enjoy!   DETAILS YOU CAN SKIP  I had been out of town since Jan 2016 and just got back in town over a week ago. Last Sat, I came here for happy hour after a long walk around town and was totally blown away by this newly renovated Kona Grill!  I had a fabulous HH experience, and will surely be back soon for more, yes, for lunch and dinner, too!  Specifically, this completely renovated locale (re-opened in March) has:   1. An expanded beautiful dining area, patio, bar counter and sushi bar  2. An additional bar/lounge and restroom on the 2nd fl with elevator and stair access. The bar counter has 2 gigantic tv's. Most tables up there have a view. Yes, it has its own restroom.   ONE MINOR IMPROVEMENT NEEDED  This afternoon, although we could get the router signal, we WERE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET! I was told by fellow customers that the Internet connection that day was sporadic at best.   05/28/16",

Our food came out and I still didn't have a drink, she later came back and said the summer ale was out???

The first time for their main restaurant which is decent, but you HAVE to try their happy-hour. I know that it's all day happy hour on Sundays too! I normally order the BBQ Chicken pizza ($6), fried calamari, lettuce wrap w/ chicken & shrimp, and a few of the rolls. I know some of their other locations offer the Atlantic roll (salmon roll) & spicy shrimp rolls. Everything is under $8 so you can get a healthy portion of food for cheap. It's best to go in a group so that you can get a real taste of their happy-hour menu. We didn't get any drinks so I can't comment about that menu. Just make sure to sit at the bar or outside seating for happy-hour prices.  A must try: Japaleno Yellowtail Sashimi. This is a little pricier, but if you have never tried any version of this, Kona is a great place to start. They have the perfect ponzu sauce to go with the yellowtail. The jalapenos cuts all of the fishy-taste [which usually isn't present since their sushi is fresh].  I never ate sashimi before until I tried this very dish.   Enjoy!",

On Saturdays, it runs from 1-5.  It's only offered in the bar & lounge area, which fills up quickly.    The best dishes we ordered were the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Chicken Satays.  Loved the spicy peanut sauce that came with the satays.  The pizza is so filling!!  I'm gonna say pass on the sushi.  While it's really cheap @ $3/roll, it's not so fresh.  We tried an Atlantic Roll to which we both said \"Meh!\"  The spicy shrimp was pretty good, however their calamari wasn't so much.   They offer a house Chardonnay & Cab @ $6/glass during HH.  The Chard was not bad for cheap HH wine.  They also have a Sake @ $6/bottle.  The service is hit or miss.  We've had OK experiences and one horrible experience, but never fantastic.",

He didn't do a bad job..He gets 1 star for that.  Another 2 stars for the amazing appetizer! I would return just to have that sweet and spicy shrimp again.  3 starts in total so far...  I wouldn't get another entree there, though.  It's overpriced.      While the steak was cooked perfectly medium and juicy, there were no seasonings on it.  That was in direct contrast with the \"seasonal veggies\" which was just broccoli with 2 tiny pieces of what I think was eggplant...it didn't matter, because all I could taste was sesame seed.  I actually spit it back out. I've never done that before. I've also never left a large amount of food on my plate without requesting a to go box.  Waiter asked if I wanted one...I said no, told him I didn't like it because it was a bland steak and just not good.  He took the plate...no apology and no offer to make it right.  3/4 of that meal was thrown out and I still had to pay full price...$31! Plus the appetizer..my bill for just me...over $50.  1 star lost for the bad food and another lost for the lack of attention to my feedback about the quality of my meal.  Down to 1 star again.  The manager was rude. We called her over to discuss issues we had with our food...I wasn't the only one with substandard food at our table.  They served one party member old french fries and another item clearly sat under the heat lamps while the rest of our meals were finished. None of us felt she handled herself well under the circumstances.  That's 1 star lost...but that's 0 stars...and we can't give 0 starts on Yelp.  So I'll give another 1 star for the ambiance and another for the location...but take away another because the ladies room was gross.  That's 1 star.  I really want to give them more than 1 star, so let's give that amazing shrimp a 3rd star...it really was THAT good.  All in all, I may go back for happy hour sometime and have the shrimp and give this place another chance, but I'm not in a hurry.  I really wanted to like this place, but it was disappointing.",

I always get the sliders which consists of two large sliders and fries. It's a ton of food for the happy hour price. A lot of my friend's rave about the sushi. It's a fun atmosphere but can get a bit loud so I recommend sitting on the patio.",

The price isn't cheap and its not too expensive. If your not too hungry - just order from the appetizer menu its very full filling! esp during the happy hour its a lot cheaper too.   I really like the location. Located at Boca Park in Summerlin. So if you live near the area check it out and for anyone who wants to get away from the Las Vegas \"strip\" and the hype then definitely.",

The only thing this place needs help with is staffing.  We sat at the bar and were mostly ignored, and had to flag down attention when we wanted something. Bartenders were gossiping about another customer and quite loudly. Was bit surprised how open it was. They seem kind of stuck up too. I thought it was a bit unprofessional and immature. Think they need better customer service there.  So, to complete my review. Delicious food. Not so great staff.  Update: I have raised this review to 4 stars from 3. We went back to give it another go.  It was a slow night there. This time we sat in the dinning area instead of the bar and had above superb service. Our waitress (named Karen) was on top of everything and very sweet. So, best bet might be to sit in the dining room rather than the bar. They seem to care more in this section! Overall I recommend Kona, if nothing else, at least for the delicious food and apps.",

Our waiter was a poor young fellow, hipster angle to him, and tried his very hardest to figure out exactly what to do with us.  He was attentive, friendly, and took our constant harassment of him very well.  The food (shrimp and salad, ahi, and one burger) was excellent, and when Super-Fussy sent her food back (twice) it came out without hassle and without being spat on.  Nothing was wrong with it--just she wanted things replaced or warmed up.  It happens when we dine with her.  We consider it part of her charm.  Luckily she tips accordingly.  The waiter kept our glasses full, ensured we were all right, but also had mastered the art of \"attention without being smothering.\"  Great job, Kona grill!",

The manager at the time did allow our group to move tables around to fit our large group together which was very nice.

It looks very hip and modern. The prices are good and I really enjoy the BBQ chicken flatbread along with the Moscow mules on Happy hour. Sliders and rolls are all good too. The service just continues to get worse and worse however. Lauren was my server most recently and after waiting for 50 minutes for a sushi roll, she brought a different tables sushi to us, then took it back after realizing her mistake. Not once did she apologize, it was almost like she avoided our table because she knew she messed up. AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES after ordering, we finally got our first plate, and the entire meal came staggered. Water and drinks were empty the whole meal, never got offered a refill. It was so bad that I actually wanted to walk out and I've never done that. The lady manager kindly apologized (I'm glad someone did) but our experience had already been ruined at that point. There's way too many other options in Las Vegas- even in the same shopping center- that you can get good food AND service at.",

Apparently the sushi bar is the new Starbucks as a gentleman was taking up 2 spots, one for his food and other for his laptop. But we were able to get a seat. Matthew ended up being our server, and wow he must not have been enjoying his day. First thing he told us was that happy hour is ending and we only have a few minutes if any to get our orders in. Wow thanks man, we just sat down. The hilarious part is my previous review talked about being ignored by the server, this time my mother was ignored. He took my drink order but didn't ask my mom if she wanted anything. He returned and asked her finally if she wanted anything. He took our order for an app and 2 entrees. Apparently he also doesn't know seat numbers at the sushi bar as both runners for our app and entrees asked different parties at the bar if it was their order. The runner asked everyone at the sushi bar if the potstickers were theirs, and the runner for the entrees asked the couple next to us. How hard it it to deliver food to numbers seats?   The only sign of hope this dam restaurant has is Oscar (I think that is his name) at the sushi bar. Though we never ordered anything with him nor did we get sushi he kept checking in on us asking if everything was good. Having conversations with us, ect. Very nice guy and should replace the servers I have had the unfortunate dealings with. I even told him his service is friendlier and better than our servers. Again FSM Kona is light years above and beyond it terms of service over this location. Food is great and Oscar at the sushi bar are the only reasons you may even want to try this place.",

When I spoke with one of the managers there she was dismissive and rude to me. She said there was no way he got sick from the sushi even though our server said the sushi looked strange tonight as well! Because of the manager's rudeness and the food poisoning we will NOT be going here again. I'm surprised by management's combative nature in dealing with customers at this establishment. Not a way to treat your customers that's for sure. If she would have handled it differently and been polite I would not be writing this review right now.",

I can't believe that after living in Vegas for so many years I've never tried this place! Just one of those places you always drive by and just never stop! I could kick myself for never trying it until now! Recently the weather here in Vegas has been amazing so I called my girlfriend up to go out and have some drinks but we wanted a spot that had a nice patio and seating to enjoy some sun and good cocktails! When we arrived we were greeted kindly by the hostess that informed us that happy hour is seat yourself so we picked our own table! Once we found the table we wanted we were almost immediately greeted by our friendly waitress! She made some suggestions since I was new which was a plus! I am a margarita on the rocks kind of guy and she suggested after I do that one to do one of the flavored ones! It was just as good! The crunchy roll and flatbreads on the happy hour menu were quite good as well! No complaints and service is amazing!! I will be returning for many more happy hours!",

Drinks start off at $4.50, with a variety of mix drinks, sangria's, and wines.  There's a food menu as well with sushi, lettuce wraps, and sandwiches. The ambiance was great we decided to eat upstairs since there was a big group of us. The waiter was amazing, and understanding. I wish I could've remembered his name but he was very polite and fast. We were able to the games, and socialize.  The food was awesome, and so we're the drinks.",

Both times we sat at the bar and the bar staff was fine but the food took too long. The first visit I requested 2 of the same rolls, 1 tempura and one not. After 45 mins, they both came out tempura. I said that's ok as I was starving. I gave them the benefit of the doubt since they had recently opened and probably experiencing glitches. About 2 weeks later we returned and again I ordered my same 2 rolls same way.....I don't even know how much time had passed but long enough to ask the server to please check on my rolls bc now it's not ok. Both rolls came out....not Tempura. I was annoyed now so the female manager came over and asked me what the problem was and I showed her. She said \"We're too busy to tempura the rolls so I've asked the Sushi chef to not fry them anymore\". I was completely shocked and in disgust with her idiotic answer and manager behavior. That's fine as that area offers plentiful dining options and happy hour choices",

And besides that all our other sushi rolls including a $15 lobster roll tastes no better then airport sushi . My girlfriend had to ask to get a water refill and I also needed a refill and I lifted my glass for the waitress to fill mine next and she just finished filling hers and turned away immediately not even checking to see if the other two people needed water ? Last but not least we ended up complaining to the manager about the taste and look of the \"spicy tuna\" in our unordered rolls and gross looking hand rolls and we showed him pictures of what spicy tuna should look like and he said \"sir this is ground spicy tuna \" umm gross you guys show off too be a decent high class sushi grill but serve customers ground spicy tuna that tastes disgusting ? I've been too tons of sushi places not only in Vegas but all over and I have never had service or spicy tuna like this , I will never we return to Kona Grill and I will never recommend it to others . Btw with all of these bad things that happened with our experience the manager never offered a discount or anything for our problems we had there . Just DON'T GO !!!",

It was extremely over-cooked. To the point where the Ahi had almost the same texture as canned tuna.   2 other people in our party ordered Burgers, which were supposed to be Medium.  They were so rare, the cow was still mooing.   Another person in our party, had his entree' mistakenly given away to another party.   While, the manager came over and took the wrong orders off the bill, it was an unpleasant experience, overall.   I would not recommend this place, and would not return based off this experience.   I really wanted to like this place, but the world was against me tonight.",

On the bright side, the sushi was better than expected; we even wanted a second round of sushi, but  our waitress assumed we were full and finished; feeling like \"pigs\" we asked for the menus back, luckily unbeknownst to us, it was a reverse happy hour starting at 9 pm. Finished off our second meal and left just before the \"20-somethings meet-up club\" event...just kidding but it did become a singles scene.",

Our waitress tried very hard but the evening was less than successful. For a bill that came to about $50 a head I have to say it was a huge failure. Our drink orders weren't taken for almost 10 mins and then we waited another 20 to get them. We had to ask for water 2x and the first round of drinks were so weak none of us could tell if there were any spirits used to make them. We asked for each to be remade which took another 15mins and while they were stronger not at all worth the $14 price. Food came out almost 45mins after we ordered and three people had they orders come incorrect. In fact we got a burger that was raw and cold inside. Wrong garnish and not enough condiments. Not once did management come by or even inquire. Our waitress did her best to recover but she was clearly over her head. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Wouldn't be going back.",

    "text": "I went to Kona Grill for the first time this past weekend, after having it recommended to me MANY times.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  Maybe because of all the hype.  The food was pretty good (I had the chopped salad with macadamia nut crusted chicken), but not great.  We also ordered a sushi roll to share as an appetizer, and that was good.  The three others in my party all said their entrees were \"good,\" too... but no one was raving about any of it.  Our desserts were GIANT and tasted good.  The really bad part of our experience, was definitely our flaky waiter.  As I said, we ordered our sushi as an appetizer... and he even asked if we wanted it before our entrees and we said yes... but after waiting a long time (probably about 20 minutes), our roll came at the same time as our entrees.  Then after we ate our entrees, we sat and sat and sat and sat, waiting for the dessert menu.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waiter at all (not even at tables around us), we finally asked a busser if he could find our waiter.  We watched the busser look for him all around the kitchen and the dining room.  I'm not sure where our waiter was hiding, but it took another five minutes just to find him.  When he finally did show up, he gave us our bill without even bringing the dessert menu.  He took the bill back and finally brought us a dessert menu, and we asked him what he recommended.  He said \"let's be honest... I'm gonna tell you everything on the menu is good.\"  Umm... ok.  So I don't really want to judge the restaurant on this really bad waiter... because I am sure not EVERY waiter there is that awful... but with so many other great places to eat in town, we definitely won't be going back any time soon.",

    "text": "Went here today for happy hour to celebrate a girlfriends birthday.  We had 11 in our party. We found a large table in the newly renovated upstairs part of the bar in the back. The downside there was no fan or misters in this part of the bar.  An oversight that hopefully they will figure out once some one passes out from heat stroke. First day it hit one hundred degrees this year and we were miserable.  We would have moved but there were no tables left to fit our large party. Than there is a middle section upstairs that faces south and closest to Lee's liquor that has an open section in the patio cover.  Those tables had the sun beating down on them.  At least they had some fans and misters. But still looked uncomfortable. If your sitting anywhere near the railing the sun hits you there too. Since the reopening the happy hour menu is more extensive with the food and everything we ordered was good. The drink menu not so desirable. The food came quick but if you ask for extra plates or condiments it takes forever because they have to go downstairs to get it. Our server was hit and miss. Forgot drinks, didn't keep water glasses full (after all we were sitting in the hot corner).  We had lots of plates sitting around after we finished. Forgot to bring drinks. However he was always pleasant. Brought wrong food and forgot to deduct from bill. If there were 1/2 stars I'd give 3 1/2 stars.  I gave 4 stars because of the potential atmosphere if wasn't for the lack of fans and misters and the location is desirable.",

Mostly in the shade, they have misters that keep the patio cool. We were greeted promptly, and our server was at our table within a couple of minutes.  We love the Kona Grill, and we keep it in our rotation of favorite restaurants. We will be coming back soon, as my husband would like to feel what the evening vibe is like.  I would give this place 5 stars, however I believe that there is always room for improvement.",

    "text": "Kona Grill is consistently good.  It's one of a handful of places that we default to if we have company in town and no one has a specific preference.  My wife and I have also celebrated a few of our birthdays and anniversaries here.  There are almost three distinct parts of this restaurant: a good amount of indoor seating, a bar that extends outside, with a decent amount of seating, and a small outdoor eating area.  Indoors is fairly quiet, the bar is typically noisy at dinner time, and the outdoor dining area falls between the two.  Indoors is somewhat dark and comfortable.  There's ample seating and other than one time, we've always been able to walk in and get a table without a wait.  If you're going for a special day like Mother's Day, it's best to make a reservation.  The bar and dining outside are first come, first served.  Oh, for those transitional weather days when it gets chilly in the evening, there are heaters outside.  During the warmer times of the day, the seating is covered.  The menu is big enough that you'll find something (or a lot of things!) to enjoy.  There's also a fairly robust sushi bar with seating, or you can have any sushi creation brought to your table.  A respectable assortment of sushi rolls are listed on the menu.  There's also a great assortment of salads, soups, chicken, seafood, beef and vegetable dishes prepared the American continental way, or with a Hawaiian or Asian flare.  Go and enjoy, swim through the menu, and see what you like.  And it's located in Boca Park, so you'll have some before or after dinner options for shopping or strolling there or just next door at Tivoli Village.",

With that being said, the place has been really going downhill for quite some time now and today was my last time there. The food is always hit or miss and so is the service. Today there was literally 1/2\" of rice on my super sloppily put together sushi rolls, the flat bread was burnt and of corse the classic lipstick mark on my martini glass. They also keep raising the happy hour prices and lowering the food and drinks quality. There were tons of flies and bees all over the outdoor patio because the place has gotten so sticky and nobody cares enough to clean it thoroughly. This was super annoying and disturbing and no one could really enjoy the food or drinks. 2 years ago there were people always waiting for a table for happy hour because the place was packed and so much fun; today there were just 2 occupied tables outside... After being super distracted by the bees we decided to move inside the restaurant but our server was nowhere to be found. We just started moving our plates and drinks and when he saw us he just sat there and watched us doing it without moving a finger!  RIP Kona Grill, you used to be the best spot in Summerlin and now just a sad going downhill crappy restaurant...",

The outside table had not been wiped down thoroughly and there were a few flies swarming around so we decided to wait for a table to open up in the bar/lounge area so that we could order from the happy hour menu.   We ordered the calamari, which was probably the best item we tried but was not that impressive compared to many others in the area. We also ordered the cheeseburger sliders which were too pink, and the fiery shrimp and crab crunch rolls which were just ok but nothing special.   Our food was delivered before we received plates, so we had to get up and ask the bartender to provide some for us.  And our server, who was rushing around did not return to ask how our food turned out or if we would like to order anything else.   I don't plan on returning here.",

I ordered a oriental salad with chicken. The salad arrived literally with just cabbage, no green onions, 2 red pepper strips, didn't see any cilantro or carrots, one small \"cube\" of ramen and NO chicken. Of course the lovely waitress took it back but I was disappointed that she served it in the first place. The \"free\" appetizer is only valid with an order including an \"entree\" so I guess that was my bad for overlooking the fine print. Bottom line ~ I'll go elsewhere next time.",

You could get a delicious margarita flat bread pizza that is mouth watering for $5. They also have wonderful sushi rolls and very reasonable prices. The atmosphere is fun and laid back. Beware that showing up right at 5-6 during happy hour is prime time and seats are very limited! It has recently been renovated and happy hour prices did increase. It is still worth visiting, but not as good as a deal as it used to be.",

The bar floor was a mess in the public walk way. Waiters and management picked up straws off the floor and never washed their hands after.

Most of our party was already seated, but my other half and I arrived a little later than expected. I walked in to the restaurant, and was not greeted at all by the hostess, who seemed to be having a conversation with someone sitting next to the host/hostess stand. Anyways, we got to the table where the rest of our party was seated. What I didn't understand is that 6 adults were assigned to sit in a booth that seems to only comfortably sit 4 people. I would have appreciated a much more comfortable seating arrangement especially because we had put in a reservation.   Staff- Our waitress was kind and took care of us. She brought us refills before we were finished with our drink. Our waitress was probably one of the only things that I could walk away feeling satisfied with.   The food- I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne, which turned out to be much spicier that I anticipated. In the description on the menu, the entree consisted of Parmesan, Baby Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, Lemon Cream and Garlic Bread. In my opinion, a little note of the spice should be added Just in case anyone has a problem with spicy food. I toughed out the kick of the spice, however, another person in my party needed to return her entree because she cannot eat anything spicy. It was tasty, just a tad too spicy for my liking. Yes I could have returned my plate to ask for the dish to be less spicy, but i chose not to since it was busy and I was hungry.",

I only have them 4 stars rather than 5 because they didnt have what I ordered available and I had to choose something else. Just be aware that it is in an are with many other restaurants so be prepared to search for parking .",

We ordered the chicken satay and a few other items, and after taking my first bite I had to spit it out because it was raw. The waitress said she would remove it from the check only to see it still on there when the check was given to me. I had to speak to the manager and he was telling how the Health Department was just there. He even pulled out a pamphlet that was given to them by the HD about temperatures when cooking (I wonder if they were there because a customer complaint about being serve raw chicken). I asked if they were just here why did it comeback raw? He did not have an answer and said he would mention it to the cook. I also asked him if he knew that someone can get a foodborne illness serving raw chicken? He said yes. I'm just glad I did not get sick. We barely ate any of the food because we lost our appetite and I felt they should've just cancelled our order all together. I will not be coming back here!!!",

    "text": "So our birthday club ended up here for dinner lat night. I had not been here in years and they have totally revamped the bottom floor and in addition they added a second level.  This place has always reminded me of a meat market where those who want to be seen are present and looking to get lucky.....snicker, snicker!  As I walked in, I really like what they have done. The floor is open and no longer dark. I love the lighting and the decor. The main bar and the sushi bar are separate and both bars are set up in squares.  Our booth was nice except is was right next to the cashiers area. Still no noise or interruption from the servers though. Our server was very nice and delivered great service to our table all night long. I wish I could remember his name as I would love to give him a shout out. I briefly mentioned to him that is was my friends birthday and he surprised her with a lovely dessert! He was the best!   I ordered the Macadamia Crusted chicken with a creamy Shoyu sauce, broccoli and for dipping a mango/pineapple sauce. It was ok but nothing I was over the moon about. The chicken was flavorful but the dish came semi-warm. I like my food served hot. The best part about the meal was the free appetizer/sushi roll that you receive upon check in. At first, they tried to tell me that the check in was only for a free appetizer so I pointed out in black and white that it also listed sushi roll. They were happy to accommodate us. We also enjoyed a pitcher of their red sangria/sake. This drink was really refreshing on such a hot evening.   Overall, the evening was a success but I can take or leave this restaurant.",

    "text": "My best friends and I came here to finally try their Happy Hour that I'm always hearing great reviews about! Especially finding out that they had a separate vegan, vegetarian, & gluten free menu, I knew we had to go!   We arrived to the restaurant and found out that it is open seating during HH - you can sit pretty much anywhere except in the dining room.   Service was really great, considering the fact that it was super busy! Our server was really accommodating and super helpful when it came to ordering.   For food, my friends ended up getting the sliders, margherita flatbread, and California roll from the HH menu which they really liked! The sliders are huge! It was like two regular size burgers and it was big enough for my sister to take home leftovers.  Keep in mind that if you're vegan and order from the HH menu, there's literally only one roll you can get which is the vegetarian roll. I ended up getting this but wasn't really satisfied at the end of the meal - the roll was bland to me and literally just tasted like a couple bits of veggies smushed together with rice and nothing memorable about it. I had to really dip it in soy sauce to get a decent flavor out of it.   Overall, we had a fun experience for our first HH at Kona! I just wish their HH menu was more accommodating to vegans.",

We got our usual Macadamia-crusted Chicken that comes with fried rice, green beans and a crema to-go. I got home and I thought I was swimming in the ocean with my mouth open - that's how salty my food was and I'm not exaggerating. To fix it and make it edible, put the green beans in hot water; add plain white rice to the fried rice; squeeze lemon on the chicken. But I shouldn't have to do all that!  They should have called the dish that evening \"Chicken of the Sea\" because that's literally what it was.",

    "text": "I went back and forth between three and four stars for a while -- I went with three because I don't feel like the meal or restaurant will be memorable in any way.  I came here for a late business lunch on a Friday afternoon.  It was a lovely restaurant.  The crowd had thinned out a little bit and hadn't yet started with the \"happy hour\" crowd, so it was overall a pleasant experience.  The food was fine.  It was tasty and plentiful.  I had shrimp pad Thai, which I always enjoy no matter where I am.  It had a touch of spice to it, but nothing to shy away from.  They were generous with the shrimp - which I REALLY appreciate.  I felt like I was getting good bang for my buck.    One of my co-workers had the chicken pad Thai, which he enjoyed a lot, the other had the miso sea bass -- which he says is one of his favorite dishes at any restaurant.    However, at the end of the day, Kona Grill is a chain.  It feels and tastes like a chain.  Everything is very generic.  The food was good, but not great.  It didn't feel daring or creative in any way.  Granted, I had pad Thai; maybe if I'd tried something else, I might have thought different, but a lot of the dishes looked like they'd be too heavy for midday.    The service was also fine.  The servers were attentive and friendly, but I didn't feel like anyone went the extra mile.    Overall, it was good.  I might go back again, but I don't know that I'd be disappointed if I didn't.",

Lastly, their drink menu during happy hour is nice a well.  We ordered their frozen margaritas and after two drinks, we felt great!  It helped set up the rest of the nights events where we did not need another drink to enjoy ourselves or to help relax us.",

The patio + happy hour prices + their food is just so great.   Honestly though,used to be a bigger fan before the remodel and prices went up. Still a great place, but just not the same. I used to love the contrast of the outside patio with the darker intimate inside. Now just looks a bit more like a typical restaurant/ sports bar.   Although the price increases aren't drastic, the difference between $5 and $7.75 does add up.   But anyway... Their food is good and the vibe is great. Calamari has always been a fave, avocado eggrolls, sushi... It's all good.   Happy hour all day on Sundays. Mon- Fri happy hour is 3-7 and 9-11. Saturdays 1-5 and Friday/Saturday nights 10pm-12am",

I have been to this restaurant multiple times and go here for the happy hour best Tito's martini you can get on a happy hour menu. But the service I have experienced has NEVER been good. I started to wonder if maybe it was the bar so I next time I tired the dining with friends it was worse then thought ok maybe outside on their patio not even close to being better. So I never recommended it to anyone and only went out when asked with friends because the service was SOOOO BAD!! rude staff doesn't even describe the words. Until I was on a blind date and he wanted to go there. We sat on the patio where with in seconds we were greeted with this blonde bubbly server named ASHLEE!!!! who was just so into making us feel right at home that I couldn't believe I was at Kona grill. She made everything look effortless and was so positive and upbeat that it was contagious. Not only did my nerves go away with the blind date my whole look on Kona Grill was so different. She was hands down amazing. Great service all around she's exactly what you look for when you go out to be waited on. If you ever go to Kona at the evening time ask for a blonde bubbly waitresses named ASHLEE! she's exactly what Kona Grill should take into mind when training their staff! Thank you Ashlee for the wonderful experience, laughter and upbeat personality that's exactly what was needed. You get her on happy hour its definitely worth coming. I will now be coming back even if it's just myself because of the of the service she provided and I will most Definitely be asking for her as should all of you that has had a bad experience with staff at Kona!!!!",

It's really important that you get the server to read back your order as, every time we have gone here, they always get one or two things wrong. Not terribly wrong, they just miss anything that you want added to your order like soy wraps instead of seaweed, no scallions for the Miso Soup, extra ginger, extra wasabi, etc. All fixable, but it would be nice if they actively listened to your ordering.  I am giving them 4 stars, since all of these things are fixable, and, we truly love this place for Asian and Asian Fusion meals.   The presentation of their food is top-notch. I am a home-chef and would love to make food as pretty as theirs.  My wife and I enjoy this place and we will return again, and again and again.",

Here, you actually feel like you're part of the action. However, I went for sushi and my grading is based on what I came in for. Ordered 4 rolls from their happy hour menu and was disappointed. The fried sea bass tasted fishy. The imitation crab tasted poor quality. They confirmed that their fish is not wild caught. I've been to quite a few sushi spots in Summerlin area. If you're looking for sushi, this isn't it. :) I don't have an opinion on other menu items.",

She said she would be with us on a moment. So while waiting 5 minutes we sat down until she decided she was available. Same time another lady walked in and she immediately helped her. Grabbed two menus and then asked where we wanted to sit. We told her a table. She attempted to sit us but the table we went to was dirty.   Again she said give her a minute. She never came back.   To have greeters like that is not cool. Does not greet and rude as hell. Guess that meant the pizza spot next door got our service.",

This one here in Las Vegas had a very similar five but a completely different layout which made it twice is fun. Downstairs there is a huge restaurant area along with the bar and outdoor seating. Which included TVs and live music for the patrons to be entertained.  However, my favorite area is the second floor which has televisions as well but the setting is more intimate and you get to look out over some scenery. Plus the bar is right next to you, so your server is always able to top you off. Speaking of servers,  Our server was wonderful, competent, and attentive.  there was some 90s rock music playing over the PA system which added to the nice vibe. It is a different repeat location and I'll be back soon!",

As the food is excellent and the Happy Hour superb, we are used to it being a very busy place. However, we were never treated as poorly as we were last night. Neither of the bartenders could be bothered to wait on us and when we were lucky enough to flag them down, we were met with frowns and nasty attitudes. As we were celebrating my birthday, I can tell you that I regret even going there. We have always had wonderful service in the past, whether we sat at the bar or at a table. Not once have we ever felt that we were unwelcome..until last night. I will be contacting the corporate office today to also let them know how incredibly bad our experience was.",

I've been to this place on numerous occasions and have always had a memorable experience. The service is all on their game with customer service and knowledge. When a establishment has team members with personalities it adds to the appeal of the restaurant tenfold.  I've had numerous of their dishes and all the dishes I've had from the sushi to the dessert has been food-gasmic. The dishes are fresh and full of flavor. Their happy hour is fricken amazeballs. On Sundays, it's all day long! Yes, you read me right, ALL DAY LONG! And if the weather is perfect, outside seating and upstairs seating enhances the relaxed vibe. Their drinks are mixed to perfection, not overly poured like they do on the strip. It's a great spot for date nights or family dinners.",

Cuz some people do work late and instead of trying to rush over from work at 6pm to make the end of the 7pm happy hour, they can rest a bit, have dinner.  Then come by at 10pm for second happy hour.  What's super cool is for a couple appetizers and two drinks each, we spent a little around $40.  In context, at the clubs along the strip, one drink can cost $20.  Here's a place with a good happy hour menu, times, location, and atmosphere.  The patio seating has mist sprays and comfy furniture if you sit along the outer parameters.  There appears to be a stone firepit too, except a lit fire isn't needed yet.  It's nice sitting outside!  Hey though their lettuce wraps were good.  Spicy and daring, and I liked the kick!  Funny thing is the lettuce wraps were an unintended order.  My bff Elaine was already there waiting for me.  When I talk texted something to her I began with \"let us\"...  My text message did not make sense at all to her when she read \"lettuce\", but she didn't question me even if the entire sentence didn't make sense.  She ordered lettuce wraps!  And now ima lettuce wrap fan :D  Well if any of you are here to visit from wherever, Kona Grill is a recommended place to start your weekend or evening for chillaxing during their happy hours.  Make it a fun one!",

We are regulars that go to KG at least a couple of times per week and it never disappoints. The reason I am taking to Yelp with a two star review is that since TWO weeks the frozen margarita machine is not working. It might sound a bit petty but this is one of our main reasons to come to KG. A frozen margarita with some angry edamame and sashimi is just heaven. We've been there about four times in the last two weeks and even talked to the manager about it. Today I called again and it's still not working. I mean seriously?  How hard can it be? I would offer to go to Target across the street and buy you a blender if that's what it takes. So long story short, we love the place, the food and the people but we just won't go there anymore until the margarita machine works again...sorry! I hope someone from management reads this, I am sure that in a competitive restaurant environment with as many options as Las Vegas, it should be a high priority to fix something as simple as a broken margarita machine.

I drove by a couple times to try, but always so packed with people literally hanging off the balconies I decided to wait for a slightly slower evening.  So on a misty Monday night, I thought....perfect it won't be packed. And I was right!! When we walked in for dinner, the host informed us there was great happy hour in the bar. Who am I to say to to some extra happiness! Especially in sushi form!  They were right! Tons of apps were only $4 and $5. We ordered a bunch and had a great of shared snacks.   The upstairs looks like it has an awesome outdoor dining area! Can't wait to try that!!",

Once we got our checks they didn't have happy hour prices and then when we asked about it seemed VERY annoyed. made us really uncomfortable. bottom of the line don't ask for victoria i mean unless you like someone with an attitude.",

    "text": "So, I have heard about this place for at least the last ten years. I have driven by it many times. However, it never attracted me to come in even though I love REI. My better half and her girls have been patronizing this place for years and like it. I finally went since friends insisted hey treat me for helping them move some stuff.  I didn't know they remodeled. So, I am not sure what they looked like before. The place looks hip and trendy. Since I am not single and no one in our party was, no one dressed up.  Not that we dress up for most of these eateries in town. It's LV after all and its always casual. Anything special about the decor? Not to me at least. I can easily sit here or sit at Blue Martini, Cheesecake Factory, or Roy's, and not blink an eye. Do t get me wrong, everything looks new and trendy, if you are into that kind of thing. I just wanted a place to sit.  We entered and there were a bunch of hostesses(?) standing around. I am not sure what they were. They were stranding by the podium @ the entrance. I assumed we were told there were no seats available. I was related the message from my friends as I mozied in from behind my group. The girls went looking downstairs for a table and I went upstairs with a friend looking for a table. We went, circled around and found a table in the back. As we were about to call, the girls told is het found a table downstairs too. I always thought that was the hostesses job? As much as I love to hear about their social affairs standing in their booth. I can really care less. It doesn't pay the bills, but  I believe we did. Do you really want to go to a place where you are not really made to feel welcome? But they were busy so I am sure they can care less about a party of 4.  We ordered a crap load of food and drinks and the dinky round bar table could barely contain anything so the server was nice and brought them out as we finished. It would have been more nice if the drinks got refilled as promised. It's so dark outside once he sun goes out. I understand ambiance but you really are just sitting in the dark outside. As the temp cooled, I had to put on my jacket along with everyone else in my group. A gas heater would have provided some light and warmth and served to enhance ha ambiance. It is named after Kona? Do they not ever see Tiki lounges with torches outside? Heck any restaurant outside you go in Hawaii there's something burning at night to give light and ambiance.  So the food. It was ok. Some avocado roll was the best. The pizza thing was ok. More cheese than tomato sauce but that's a personal preference. The sushi tasted good enough for bar food. Yes, to me this is bar food. You know a place you can get tapas and the like. The burger slider was good. Again, it was good but nothing to write home about either. Maybe if it had more flavor it would but overall it was kind of bland. A Five Guys burger has more taste. So overall the food was average. Presentation was great but the taste is just alright. This is where having a great experience would compensate for the food a bit. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad here. It just could have a little more flavor. The best was the avocado thing out of the five items we ordered. We had a thing with a tortilla chip on the bottom and something on top. I am thinking it was some kind of fish. But, that's how memorable the food was to me.  The server seemed to be trying to get the knack of things but was friendly and cheerful. The bussers worked their butt off. And the hostesses held the podium up.  Oh the scene. I noticed there were quite a few single people sitting and eating by themselves. Kona grills reputation previously as told to me was that it was running with cougars with money and cops. That's probably why I never cared to come. From what I could see as I was walking around to search for a table to sit, there's quite a few available ladies out here ready to mingle.  Will I come back? Yeah maybe in the next 10 years. I am not particularly fond of having to look for my own table when there's people paid to do just that. I will just stick to Downtown Summerlin for local eats. It's within walking distance for me anyway. No need to drive that far to get lousy service. So, unfortunately, as nice as the hard working bussers and waitresses are, those ditzes ( I apologize to ditzes everywhere else) ruin it for the whole staff. I am pretty sure they view customers with biased glasses. But ladies, if you were working at my office, you would've been addressed to shape up or shipped out a long time ago. Then again, maybe Kona Grill pays these professional podium models to keep the place from falling down and pick and choose who they want to feel welcomed at their establishment.",

To be fair we had gone before and had a pleasant time. Not the case on Monday though. Here's a list of things gone wrong: Drunk patron bothering us and other people (bartenders kept serving him and he left and drove away) our server said he doesn't have a license and has been through at least 4 cars! They know this and still serve him??? Misters on the patio getting us and others literally soaking wet. After we repeatedly asked to have them shut off Never cleaned off empty glasses and plates from our table for 4.5 hours! Never topped off water glasses even after we asked from more ice and another glass of water! Auto flush valves in ladies bathroom didn't work. Toilets filled with TP, etc. Lock on bathroom stall broken and has been broken for at least a couple of weeks. Positive note. Food was good and was served promptly.",

We were surprised to see a sushi bar in the restaurant but I guess it's kinda normal it being sort of a \"fancier\" Hawaiian themed restaurant lol  ..anyway we tried their mules, London and Kentucky, they were very well made and very tasty I got the Cuban sandwich, which was so tender and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries were perfect, slightly sweet with a crisp!!  We also got the chicken avocado club which was exceptional as well  oh and the hand made taro chips that came with it was too good too!! .. As for an appetizer we started it with the fried calamari which was pretty standard but delicious none the less   It was a definitely good experience and a relaxed atmosphere with friendly service.  Will keep this place in mind the next time we are in the area",

    "text": "Thanks to the all the Yelp reviews I was aware that happy hour is all day on Sunday. We originally had a reservation for 10 at 3 PM on Mother's Day in the dining room. When we arrived they were still setting up our table. The very courteous hostess then informed us that there was room available for our party on the patio. I then remembered about the all day happy hour and we accepted the offer to sit outside. The weather was perfect that day which provided a great atmosphere for our meal.  Happy hour gave us the chance to order and sample many items. For drinks, I had a bottle of cold sake for $6.75 and my wife had the sparkling sangria for $6.50. For food, they have select items for $6 and other rolls and flatbreads for half off. We ordered pretty much the entire HH menu except for a flatbread. Everything was quite tasty and no plate was left with food on it. The shrimp tacos were a hit and I enjoyed the Voodoo Roll which has spicy crawfish, tuna, and habanero sauce.  Mychael was our server and he did a fine job despite being very busy with multiple tables aside from our 10 top. One thing to be aware of is that the bar and patio areas are first come first serve so there will be vultures hovering around, especially when you are coming close to finishing because they want your table. Happy hour at Kona Grill is a good value and we'll definitely be back.",

The hostess rushed us to a table at the bar and we soon learned a table was a very hot commodity (everyone after us were waiting to get a table).  We were not given any menu or anything so we just ordered from some table flyer.   What we ordered:  Sushi-Crab Crunch Roll, California Roll Avocado Roll Bulgogi Tacos Blue Moon  Well I will say the presentation of the food was nice. The sushi will not be a choice I make again. Very very bland, as if it was picked up from the grocery store across the parking lot and placed on a plate, I'm sorry chefs. The avocado rolls were tasty and actually paired nice the the bulgogi tacos. The tacos were very very sweet that I was thankful of the avocado rolls to balance it out. Blue Moon was well, blue moon but I guess not informed it wasn't on happy hour, oh well that's fine.  **It was very busy and I wouldn't mind attempting this place for a second time in hopes for better.",

I finally got his attention and he came over.  He said he did not like to bother people when they were on the phone.  I told him I was on hold on a business call and it was ok we could give him our drink order.  He then told me he would not be serving us alcohol at the bar and we could go find a table and be served.  I told him we were there for lunch and did not want alcohol. He proceeded to take the menus and told us again to go find a table he would not be serving us alcohol at the bar.  We got up and I asked to speak to manager.  I believe he did not want to serve my wife and I because my wife took a call from her mother and was speaking Spanish while on the call that lasted about 2 minutes.  Just did not want to service Hispanics today I guess.",

    "text": "Getting off early means one thing - HAPPY HOUR!!  And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.  We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.  We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:  * Atlantic Roll \"Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce\" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!  * Spicy Tuna Roll \"Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers\" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.  * Kona Calamari \"Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.  * Sweet & Spicy Shrimp \"Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon\" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.  * Chicken Satay \"With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.  * Avocado Egg Roll \"Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.  * Kahuna Sliders \"A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese\" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.  * Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.  We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.  Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)  Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pm Reverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pm Fridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 am  HH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.  They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)  You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!  Side note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.  Don't go to the right side corner because you'll end up in the kitchen.",

    "text": "Honestly we probably would not have come here because of the horrible atmosphere that is created by all the creeps renting fancy cars so they can park in front of kona and make women feel uncomfortable by the way they watch them. ( much like a dog watching a treat)....but it looked empty so it must have been too cold for them and we thought it was happy hour so we said why not?( we were hungry)... We sat down waited, waited, waited, (first sign we should have left) only had the happy hour menu so we figured it was happy hour ( there are no times posted on the menu and if no one is going to give you a different one then you would probably just assume).... Anyways started ordering food and he said oh it's not happy hour yet, (its about 9:35)okay we can see past that so we ordered chicken satay (way over priced for four tiny skewers) and the ahi tuna.... The tuna came out quick it was okay, but by the time the satay came out it was already into happy hour (AND the place was EMPTY)... So my friend started eating it, one bite in... RAW CHICKEN!... The waiter just cut off what we were saying and said \"I'll get it fixed\" no apology, no manager, no nothing... We didn't even want it then but because we didn't see him again until that came out another 30min later and we were hungry so we ate it (and it was totally burned on the outside, but again extremely hungry)... We are in the industry and we understand things happen but WOW... Time to pay we figure he was just being silent about the situation and it wouldn't be on the bill, but it was... So, we got no apology, no manager, potential food poisoning and/or salmonella, horrible service, and sub par food, all of which we paid for...there are so many great restaurants in Vegas and this is bottom of the barrel. Don't risk eating somewhere that doesn't care about your health and safety!!",

I could have ordered 4 of those and been happy, but i couldn't pass up the soft shelled crab sandwich! If you like soft shelled crab, then eating a whole one stuffed between two pieces of bread should only increase your love of it. Creme brulee  was the dessert of the day. I dont even remember how it tasted due to being overshadowed by the awesome coconut sushi roll! The price is up there, but considering I ate seafood it was not unexpected. Loved it.",

It's a nice place, with great food, but it's the local meat market place for singles. Whether you're a guy or girl you're going to get hit on if you're in the bar area, which is a great ego boost if you need one, but I'd really recommend this place for singles or those looking to hook up by midnight.  If you come here during the day it can be a different scene, as it's more relaxed, though it usually has a good crowd going. Never order a Mojito from here though, in the two years I was living in Vegas, they never made it right.",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm the first person to review Kona Grill! For those who don't know, this is an upper-scale chain restaurant with many locations across the US. However, I'll stay specific to the one in Las Vegas. Actually, this one is in Summerlin, which is in suburban Vegas about 15 miles west of The Strip.   The restaurant is more famous with the locals for it's bar and patio than it is for its actual dining experience and food. While it sits in a shopping center, it still manages to have a cool vibe. Also, exactly what in Las Vegas isn't in a shopping center?  The bar is open to both the bar and the patio on most nights and the patio that goes around the outside of the place is great for hanging out with friends and having some drinks. The drink selection is not fantastic, but is pretty average.   As for the food, everything I've had has been two things: delicious and uninventive. For a place that tries to have an asian fusion menu, I feel like I've either heard of or previously had everything on the menu. Which is fine, because its all very good.   The main steal here is if you come for \"Reverse Happy Hour\". This is a late-night happy hour in the bar area only where they have a ton of great pizza, sushi, and other appetizers for very, very cheap. For example, you can get a personal garlic shrimp pizza for $3.95. This is awesome as you sit outside on warm summer nights.   The hours for Reverse Happy Hour are: Monday - Thursday 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. Friday - Saturday 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.",

The the Asian/Hawaiian theme, the food is on par with many of the places I've been to, without the stuffiness of a white table cloth place.   This is only for Happy Hour, so I can't really say very much for the al la cart portion of the menu. Great deals on the drinks and food. What I usually get is the sake bombs for 6.50 and some maki rolls for 3 bucks. For a dollar more, the beef sliders and tacos is pretty good for that price! The only thing I probably wouldn't get again is the calamari, just a bit too soggy and bland for my taste.   The vibe is pretty good, with a mixture of professionals and blue collar working stiffs like me.   The service is good, but like many busy places, it can get a little slow during prime time, i.e. 7-9pm.  But how can you complain when the value of the food and drink prices are this good?   Chow.",

Like most places, happy hour is only at the bar or out in the spacious patio (first-come, first-served).   Things we tried: - California roll - Spicy tuna roll - Fiery shrimp roll - Crab special roll - Kona calamari  Everything was delectable. The California and spicy tuna rolls were better than they are at other places. The fiery shrimp roll had quite a kick. And, the Kona calamari has notable sauce. I especially enjoyed their mango margarita. Another thing to note: the above was a lot for two people, and we ended up taking a good portion of it to-go.  Bottom line: A chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious eats and drinks made for a very pleasant happy hour adventure. I will be back, Kona Grill.",

We weren't able to take advantage of the happy hour because we couldn't sit in the bar area because of my son (obviously). Kinda of a pity they don't offer happy hour for table service like they do at Yard House but I digress.  The calamari app was not my fav and I wouldn't order it again. The batter was light but just not very crispy and the dipping sauce was so thick and spicy it totally overpowered the calamari. My California roll was one step up from Costco quality. The rice was overly sticky and the avocado and cucumber were practically non existent.  The only 5 star worthy item was the kids meal. Seriously, for like $6.50 it was a ton of food and the options were fantastic. There was everything from shrimp tempura to grilled salmon to  chicken fingers. You also can select two side items and it comes with an orange cut up to look like a bear! So freaking cute. It's served in a bento box and my little guy was over the moon with excitement when he saw it.  Bottom line: would return for the kids meal alone.",

When he delivered their order, he finally  took the other half of the tables appetizer order...so, half the table was eating  and the other half sat waiting for their food to arrive.   When it came to our main course items, he delivered the wrong items to several people, noticed  his error and then proceeded to snatch the plates, walk back to the kitchen and turn around, came back to the table and served the correct dinner to the correct people. ..it was really bizarre.   The food was just ok. The table thought the food was lacking in flavor. My husband had sushi and it tasted \"fishy\" instead of fresh and clean tasting of the sea. To be fair, the server noticed that I didn't eat much of my Phad Thai and offered another selection or a refund as i didn't like it.  For the price you pay for eating at Kona Grill snd the ok food, we will not be eating here again.",

Instead we got the asst. manager who agreed it seemed very unlikely we had used the card in Illinois and Connecticut and then here in Vegas. But apparently he has no authority to make things right and we had to leave our info and wait who knows how long for \"corporate\" to get back to us. Clearly an exasperating experience and IF we hear from corporate we'll certainly request a cash refund vs ever trying to use a gift card there again.",

    "text": "Long story short: I meant to take photos of all the amazing stuff we ordered at Kona buuuuuuttttt Sundays is Happy Hour ALL DAY and that should be enough of an explanation as to why I, er, forgot ;)  All the amazing food aside (seriously all of it is amazing: the sushi rolls, the lettuce wraps, the dessert...), my favorite part of this place is that Happy Hour is all day on Sundays. What better way than wind down (or as I like to say \"wine down\"...get it?) the weekend or cure a hangover than with amazing food and alcohol at amazing prices? Rewind to before life got a little blurry yesterday and I remember how amazing the frozen raspberry margarita was. Then fast-forward to after my fourth one - they just kept getting better and better LOL. Before you think that this is what I do on weekends - it was actually an early birthday celebration for my girlfriend :) And Kona is honestly an amazing place to have an amazing time with great people, amazing food, and an overall amazing atmosphere (say \"amazing\" one. more. time). Our waitress was beyond nice and accommodating, there are misters outside since it's so hot, and for those of you who smoke, smoking IS allowed since it's outside seating.  If you've never been make sure to remember that it's first come, first serve so once you arrive feel free to grab a table :) I will obviously be back - this is kind of a tradition for my friends and I - and next time I'll upload photos.  There were five of us and our bill came to $130, so about $25 a person. That may seem a bit high BUT I know that between just my girlfriend and I, we ordered an entree and 10 drinks LOL. So no - it's not bad at all!",

The GM went above & beyond in resolving the issue.  No doubts, I will continue to be a loyal customer.",

Me and my friend sat at a table that was mostly dry and waited to be greeted. After a few minutes go by, two more people came and sat at a table and were immediately greeted. I then tried to get a server's attention and let him know we hadn't been greeted yet. He responded very rudely and rolled his eyes as he walked into the kitchen. This place is dirty and had rude staff. I don't think I'll be going back and I'll definitely warn my friends about this place.",

Tonight, the Kona Grill hostess and server accommodated our needs to ensure we had a peaceful and fun dinner with our children. We requested seating in a booth, away from other patrons. We ordered beverages, appetizers and meals for the children immediately. We received considerate and swift service from our server and the kitchen chefs. Every detail was attended to with finesse.  On our table tonight was Kona Calamari with Spicy Aioli ($11), Chili Lime Shrimp Salad ( roasted corn, cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, avocado, sauteed mushrooms, wonton strips, honey lime dressing $15), voodoo roll spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe and picasso roll spicy yellowtail mix, avocado, yellowtail, jalapeno cilantro relish, togarashi, sriracha, yuzu ponzu. The child's menu includes an entree, two sides and beverage for $6.50. I appreciate the choices like carrot sticks, rice and sweet potatoes (and there are more choices). I posted a photo under Tips.  The Kona Grill is True to its mission to provide a pleasant environment with fresh foods to \"create an upscale ambiance that reinforces our high standards of food and service\" (Kona Grill website quote).   Wish List: Bring ORGANIC rice, juice, and other items to the menu.",

It was pretty hot outside and the happy hour seating was packed and in the past before the remodel and old management the manager would let us sit inside with our kids and still give us the happy hour prices. We asked to sit inside and the waitress told us we had to go outside for happy hour and wait for a table and didn't offer us any drinks or anything. The manager came and told us to go outside because they don't allow happy hour menu inside and had no exceptions. We went back in forth for a while him telling us how he asked a family before us to go outside and wait for a table as well. Bottom line the new management sucks or at least the new manager.",

The gas lamp was not working, and the staff made very little effort to fix it, and actually kind of caught an attitude when we asked.    Then, the magic began.  We were there on a Sunday, so almost all of their specialty drinks, and many of their appetizers and rolls were half price.  I LOVE half price happy hour!  We had mojitos and pretty much any food item you can think of.  Everything was delicious.  This location is in a small strip mall, but because it was a Sunday, the usual hustle and bustle had died down.  The best part, it's a chain!  That means that I don't have to go all the way to Vegas to have more Kona :)  Try it.",

Through the whole meal we were not checked on and had to continue to ask for refills on our water and iced tea. Never saw a manager anywhere.

Patio seating is great, and yes even in the Vegas heat! They have a covered patio with misters that actually do what they are suppose to and keep you cool! During busy happy hour times (Friday nights) it does get a little tough to find a seat so I recommend going early to save spots for you and your guests.   Servers are always nice, especially one I have encountered a few times named Eddie. They usually check on your frequently without being overbearing.   Now for the food and drink! I shall review happy hour first!  Sake bombs are a must and a steal at $7 for a large Kirin and large sake. The margaritas are pretty delicious and strong too!   Food recommendations:  DEFINITELY my fave : ahi wonton crisps: fresh ahi seared and sliced on crispy wonton crisps drizzled with a wasabe dressing! YUM! -spicy tuna; cant go wrong with that -pot stickers come with a very yummy dipping sauce and are pan seared - barbeque chicken pizza is very generously portioned and can feed about 3 people ; a steal at only $6  - I would recommend just about everything on the happy hour menu!   Menu food: macadamia nut crusted chicken is also a favorite, served with a good sized portion of mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Also the oriental chicken salad with the crispy ramen noodles is accompanied with a great sesame dressing.  Overall- a must go/try for happy hour and regular menu food is pretty good too but I stick to the happy hour :)",

Sunshine Roll was all right. 2/5* I would go to real sushi restaurants for real sushi. Services is all right! 3/5* Sitting outside or bar area, servers will forget you sometime.

It's not a very high end restaurant like the ones you find on the Strip but it's still a good eat and has a cool, trendy atmosphere. I went with a co-worker we were seated in the main dinning area. You can sit at the bar, near the bar on tall tables with stools or outside on the patio. The lighting was good, not too dark but not bright either. They had some techno/trendy music playing so that was cool.   We ordered Edamame to start, good and not a lot of salt unlike some restaurants. We ordered some drinks and the bartender made them quickly and they were a little strong (always good haha). We also got the Spicy Aioli (Kona Calamari) which was a little over battered but still tasty to us. I ordered the Pan-Seared Ahi and it was just amazing. If you like sushi or lightly cooked seafood then get this dish! It was sweet because its made with sweet chili sauce; it also comes loaded with white rice (on the bottom) and baby bok choy. My co-worker ordered Miso-Sake Marinated Sea Bass and I thought it tasted great, they did also. Its really rich in buttery flavoring so if you don't really like butter don't order this dish. The Sea Bass just falls apart when you touch it and I actually wished I ordered that after trying it.   The staff was cool and knew their stuff about the menu so that helped a lot. After some drinks the total bill was about $70 before tip. Not too bad for everything that we had and the overall great experience. Check this place out if you are tired or want a change of pace from places like BJ's or Cheesecake Factory (some of my other favorite hangouts).",

Last time I came with a group of friends the server gave really poor customer service. He did not greet us, he went straight to asking the orders and only checked on us one time.. when we were all done eating. Very disappointing to say I won't be coming here anymore.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I decided to try this place out after they recently remodeled. We walked in and was lazily greeted by a young boy who looked bored as shit with his job. He asked us how many then told us he would go look for a table for us? Came back and said we had to sit outside or at the sushi bar. We decided outside even though it was cold. We were directed outside and had to find our own seat after about ten minutes someone finally came up to us and asked to take our drinks then cut us off and asked if we were 21. We aren't so she told us we couldn't sit there and she would show us to the sushi bar the only place we could sit? Then we were walked over there where all the spots were full of dirty dishes and unpicked up tips so we just left. Terrible service and they were offensive. They treated us like we were 12 which we are 18 and look and act much older. Give me the same respect as everyone else.",

    "text": "Eight of us went for a birthday happy hour get together. We snagged two tables in the bar area to put together. Great happy hour prices and we had such an awesome server! She was on point for sure. Happy hour selection is decent. The only problem is due to the patio seating (there are misters outside on the patio), the bar area tends to get super muggy and hot. We were all sweaty (gross!) Summer time patios in LV, fail...? Regardless, great place to go with a group for happy hour!",
